        Myosin-1c (Myo1c), the myosin previously called
        myosin-Iβ, myr 2, or MI-110K [ 1 ] , is an unconventional
        myosin isozyme implicated in nuclear transcription [ 2 ] ,
        lamellopodia dynamics of motile cells [ 3 4 ] ,
        brush-border dynamics of proximal-tubule cells of the
        kidney [ 5 6 ] , and adaptation of mechanoelectrical
        transduction in hair cells, the sensory cells of the inner
        ear [ 7 ] . Myo1c belongs to the myosin-I class, which
        contains eight members in humans [ 8 ] and mice [ 9 ] ; the
        bullfrog genome possesses at least two members [ 10 ] .
        Members of the myosin-I class have a single globular motor
        domain, followed by a neck region and a relatively short
        (30-40 kD) tail domain (Fig. 1A). This latter domain is
        highly basic and binds to acidic phospholipids [ 11 ] .
        Like all biochemically characterized unconventional
        myosins, Myo1c binds calmodulin light chains in its neck
        region [ 12 ] ; this region also interacts with
        non-calmodulin receptors in hair cells [ 13 ] .
        Unconventional myosins contain from one to several IQ
        domains, which are calmodulin-binding motifs that adhere to
        the general consensus sequence IQX 
        3 RGX 
        3 R [ 14 ] . Calmodulin, which can bind
        up to four Ca 2+ions, generally binds IQ domains in the Ca
        2+-free conformation; interaction of Ca 2+-bound calmodulin
        to other proteins occurs through alternative binding motifs
        [ 14 ] .
        Myo1c contains three readily recognized IQ motifs of 23
        amino acids each (Fig. 1C; refs. [ 10 15 16 17 18 ] ).
        Purified Myo1c apparently includes 2-3 calmodulins per
        Myo1c heavy chain [ 19 20 21 ] ; calmodulin supplementation
        can increase the stoichiometry to as many as 4 calmodulins
        per Myo1c [ 21 ] . Unfortunately, the lack of appropriate
        quantitation standards for the Myo1c heavy chain in those
        experiments limits the reliability of these values.
        How Ca 2+and calmodulin regulate Myo1c or indeed any
        myosin-I is unclear. Although Ca 2+increases ATPase
        activity of most myosin-I isozymes, 
        in vitro motility is usually blocked
        under identical conditions [ 11 ] . Ca 2+dissociates one or
        more calmodulins from the myosin-calmodulin complex, which
        apparently elevates ATPase activity and inhibits motility [
        11 ] . In conventional myosin, light chains related to
        calmodulin appear to be essential for stabilization of the
        myosin lever arm [ 22 ] , a domain that is vital for
        efficient conversion of chemical energy into mechanical
        work [ 23 ] . Calmodulin probably plays a similar lever-arm
        stabilizing role for Myo1c; Ca 2+-induced calmodulin
        release would reverse the stabilization and inhibit
        motility.
        To better understand the regulation of Myo1c activity by
        calmodulin, we sought to more accurately determine how
        calmodulin binds to Myo1c by measuring the Ca 2+-dependence
        of calmodulin binding to individual Myo1c IQ peptides. In
        addition, to examine the consequences of calmodulin binding
        to adjacent IQ domains, we measured hydrodynamic properties
        of recombinant Myo1c-calmodulin complexes, under differing
        conditions of Ca 2+, calmodulin, and temperature. These
        measurements allowed us to determine the molecular mass and
        hence stoichiometry of the Myo1c complex. Our results
        indicate that IQ1, IQ2, and IQ3 have calmodulin bound when
        the concentration of Ca 2+is low, and that increased Ca
        2+induces release of calmodulin from IQ1 and IQ2.
      
      
        Results
        
          Sequence analysis of IQ domains
          Examination of the primary sequence of the bullfrog
          Myo1c neck region reveals an exact repeat of five amino
          acids located both in the IQ3 region (YRNQP; residues
          761-765) and at residues 786-790. Alignment of the
          residues surrounding the repeat revealed reasonable
          homology with the three known IQ domains, with particular
          similarity to IQ3, suggesting that this region may be a
          fourth IQ domain (Fig. 1C). Although the pair of amino
          acids (LM; residues 782 and 783) that align with the RG
          of the IQ consensus motif are not conserved, the first
          pair of amino acids (IR; residues 777 and 778) that align
          with the consensus IQ adhere to the consensus better than
          those of IQ3. Because of the sequence similarity to IQ3
          and because this peptide binds calmodulin (albeit weakly;
          see below), we refer to this domain as IQ4.
        
        
          IQ - Alexa-calmodulin interaction on plastic
          plates
          To investigate the calmodulin-binding properties of
          each Myo1c IQ domain, we measured interaction of a
          fluorescently labeled calmodulin (Alexa-calmodulin) with
          individual Myo1c IQ peptides that had been conjugated to
          wells of a plastic plate. We used an IQ peptide from
          neuromodulin [ 24 ] as a positive control; calmodulin
          binds to this site, with its interaction reduced by high
          ionic strength [ 24 25 ] . As a negative control, we used
          a peptide (PVP), corresponding to the 25 amino acids of
          Myo1c immediately following IQ4. Indeed, Alexa-calmodulin
          bound to wells derivatized with the neuromodulin IQ
          peptide and did not bind to the PVP peptide (Fig.
          2A).
          Substantial amounts of Alexa-calmodulin bound to wells
          derivatized with IQ1, IQ2, and IQ3; by contrast,
          relatively little bound to IQ4-coated wells under these
          conditions (Fig. 2A). As has been noted for the
          neuromodulin IQ domain [ 25 ] , increasing the KCl
          concentration reduced binding to each IQ peptide.
          Although the data shown in Fig. 2Awere obtained at room
          temperature, we saw a similar rank order of binding -
          albeit with lower total Alexa-calmodulin bound - at 4°C
          (data not shown).
          To confirm the approximate binding strength reported
          by this assay, we used free IQ peptides to prevent
          Alexa-calmodulin binding to an IQ3-derivatized plate.
          Because the IQ peptides strongly quenched
          Alexa-calmodulin fluorescence when bound, we corrected
          fluorescence measurements using an identical assay in an
          underivatized plate. Although this quenching correction
          introduced substantial scatter into the data, we found
          that the apparent affinities for binding of peptides to
          Alexa-calmodulin followed the order IQ3 > IQ1 ≈ IQ2
          > IQ4 (Fig. 2B).
        
        
          IQ - calmodulin interaction by quenching of
          Alexa-calmodulin fluorescence
          As noted above, Alexa-calmodulin fluorescence was
          quenched upon binding to an IQ peptide (Fig. 3A). Because
          an excess of unlabeled calmodulin was able to reverse
          70-95% of the quench (Fig. 3A), we inferred that most
          Alexa-calmodulin bound to the same site as unlabeled
          calmodulin. We used this fluorescence-intensity quench
          empirically to measure the affinity of each IQ peptide
          for Alexa-calmodulin (Fig. 3B). In some experiments, Ca
          2+was held at <30 nM by chelation with 100 μM EGTA; in
          other experiments, we added 25 μM exogenous CaCl 
          2 in the absence of EGTA. These two
          concentrations mimic the low- and high-Ca 2+conditions
          that Myo1c may encounter in hair cells when the
          transduction channel is closed or open [ 26 ] . In the
          presence of 100 μM EGTA, K 
          d values followed the order IQ3 <
          IQ1 ≈ IQ2 << IQ4. Although the data were fit
          somewhat better with a modified Hill equation that with a
          standard bimolecular-binding isotherm (Fig. 3B), the
          physiological significance of Hill coefficients >1 is
          uncertain, particularly given the 1:1 peptide:calmodulin
          stoichiometry (see below). Ca 2+had only modest effects
          on the affinity of the Myo1c IQ peptides for
          Alexa-calmodulin (Table 1).
          Despite only minor effects on binding affinity, Ca
          2+did influence the calmodulin-peptide complex, as
          signaled by changes in Alexa-calmodulin fluorescence.
          Changes in fluorescence intensity during manipulation of
          a single parameter, like Ca 2+concentration, should
          report conformational changes in Alexa-calmodulin. For
          example, the fluorescence intensity of free
          Alexa-calmodulin in solution was ~15% lower in 25 μM CaCl
          
          2 than in 100 μM EGTA (left-hand
          limits in Fig. 4). Because the dye moiety itself is not
          Ca 2+sensitive [ 27 ] , the Ca 2+-dependent fluorescent
          change reflects changes in the dye's surrounding
          environment, probably signaling the compact-to-open
          structural change seen when Ca 2+binds to calmodulin [ 28
          ] . In contrast to the reduction of free Alexa-calmodulin
          fluorescence by Ca 2+, fluorescence of Alexa-calmodulin
          when saturated by IQ peptides was 1.5- to 2-fold 
          greater in 25 μM CaCl 
          2 than in 100 μM EGTA (Fig. 4; Table
          1). Thus, when Alexa-calmodulin was bound to IQ peptides,
          Ca 2+induced a conformational change that was
          substantially different from that seen in the
          peptide-free state.
        
        
          IQ - calmodulin interaction under
          stoichiometric-titration conditions
          To determine the affinities of the Myo1c IQ peptides
          for unlabeled calmodulin, we used Alexa-calmodulin as a
          reporter (Alexa-calmodulin : unlabeled calmodulin ratio
          of 1:100) in our binding studies. This approach assumes
          that Alexa-calmodulin is functionally equivalent to
          unlabeled calmodulin.
          We determined affinities by fitting the IQ-peptide
          concentration vs. fluorescence quench data with an
          appropriate model. If the IQ peptides bound only
          Alexa-calmodulin and not unlabeled calmodulin, the K 
          d and F 
          IQ /F values of Table 1would have
          described the fit to the concentration-quench plots. The
          line derived from these values did not fit the data (Fig.
          5), indicating that, as expected, unlabeled calmodulin
          binds to the Myo1c IQ peptides.
          These experimental conditions resembled a
          stoichiometric titration, where the total concentration
          of calmodulin was higher than the K 
          d values for IQ1, IQ2, and IQ3. Under
          true stoichiometric-titration conditions (fixed
          concentration of receptor at 100-fold or more than the K 
          d , varying the ligand concentration
          up to and beyond the receptor concentration), almost all
          of the added IQ peptide would bind tightly to calmodulin
          and linearly decrease the fluorescence; at the point
          where the IQ-peptide concentration exceeds the calmodulin
          concentration multiplied by the peptide:calmodulin
          stoichiometry ( 
          m ), a plateau in the fluorescence
          intensity would be reached. Because the relatively weak
          affinities observed here make such true stoichiometric
          titration impractical, we used an intermediate
          concentration of calmodulin (50 μM, ~10-fold larger than
          K 
          d ) and used equation (7) to describe
          the equilibrium precisely. This approach allowed us to
          determine both 
          m and K 
          d in the same experiment.
          In the presence of EGTA, the IQ1, IQ2, and IQ3 binding
          data were much better fit by 
          m = 1 than they were to 
          m = 2, indicating that the binding
          stoichiometry of peptide to calmodulin was 1:1 (Fig. 5).
          The K 
          d values determined with equation (7)
          were very similar to those determined for binding to
          Alexa-calmodulin alone (Tables 1and 2), confirming that
          under these conditions, the IQ peptides bind to unlabeled
          calmodulin and Alexa-calmodulin similarly.
          In the presence of Ca 2+, IQ3 also bound to calmodulin
          with a stoichiometry of 1:1 (Fig. 5). The fits to 
          m = 1 and 2 were equally good for
          IQ1 and IQ2 in the presence of Ca 2+, signifying the
          inability for this analysis to determine precise binding
          stoichiometry of IQ1 and IQ2 under these conditions. In
          addition, these data indicate that the apparent
          affinities of IQ1 and IQ2 for unlabeled calmodulin were
          substantially weakened by Ca 2+(Table 2), unlike results
          with Alexa-calmodulin alone (Table 1). Because the
          assumption that affinities of Alexa-calmodulin and
          unlabeled calmodulin for IQ peptides are identical was
          violated for IQ1 and IQ2, the actual affinities of these
          IQ peptides for unlabeled calmodulin may be even weaker
          than those reported in Table 2. By contrast, Ca 2+had
          only a very modest effect on IQ3 affinity for unlabeled
          calmodulin.
          Binding of IQ4 to unlabeled calmodulin was distinct
          from that of the other IQ peptides. The data with IQ4
          were best fit with a Hill equation (equation 4), with a
          Hill coefficient of greater than 2 (Fig. 5, thick solid
          lines), suggesting that binding of two peptides per
          calmodulin may be required for the fluorescence change.
          The apparent affinities (~100 μM) were similar to the
          concentration of calmodulin (50 μM), however, indicating
          that the apparent affinities did not accurately reflect K
          
          d values. These results with a mixture
          of unlabeled and Alexa-calmodulin were different from
          those with Alexa-calmodulin alone, where IQ4 Hill
          coefficients were close to 1 (data not shown).
          Nevertheless, these data show that unlabeled calmodulin
          can bind to IQ4, albeit with weak affinity and uncertain
          stoichiometry.
        
        
          Hydrodynamic analysis of full-length Myo1c
          To determine the stoichiometry and Ca 2+-dependent
          regulation of calmodulin binding to Myo1c with all four
          IQ motifs, we co-expressed calmodulin and full-length
          bullfrog Myo1c in insect cells using baculoviruses and
          subjected the purified Myo1c-calmodulin complexes (Fig.
          1B) to hydrodynamic analysis (Table 3). We carried out
          velocity sedimentation of Myo1c-calmodulin complexes on
          5-20% sucrose gradients to determine sedimentation
          coefficients. We measured the Stokes radius of
          Myo1c-calmodulin complexes using gel filtration on
          Superdex 200 under temperature and buffer conditions
          identical to those of the velocity-sedimentation
          experiments (Table 3). Although most experiments used 400
          mM KCl (which prevented adsorption to the gel-filtration
          matrix), we obtained identical sedimentation coefficients
          in the presence of 150 or 250 mM KCl (not shown).
          Velocity-sedimentation and gel-filtration experiments
          were carried out at 4°C, the temperature used for Myo1c
          purification, as well as at 25°C, a physiologically
          relevant temperature for a bullfrog.
          To calculate the molecular mass of Myo1c-calmodulin
          complexes, we applied the modified Svedberg equation,
          which relates mass to the diffusion constant (calculated
          here from Stokes radius) and the sedimentation
          coefficient [ 29 ] . The partial specific volume of each
          protein complex was determined using the amino-acid
          composition of the constituent proteins (Table 3; ref. [
          30 ] ). Although the uncertainty in calmodulin
          stoichiometry leads to ambiguity in this calculation, the
          calculated partial specific volumes were so close ( 
          e.g. , 0.734 for one and 0.731 for
          three calmodulins per Myo1c complex) that the precise
          value did not significantly affect the final
          molecular-mass value.
          Full-length Myo1c bound ~3 calmodulins per Myo1c at
          4°C in the presence of EGTA or CaCl 
          2 (Table 3). One of the bound
          calmodulins was only weakly associated, as elevation of
          the temperature to 25°C induced the release of 1 mole of
          calmodulin in the presence of EGTA. When Ca 2+was
          elevated to 25 μM at 25°C, however, we could not detect
          substantial full-length Myo1c in solution after
          sucrose-gradient centrifugation or gel filtration,
          suggesting that the protein had aggregated.
        
        
          Hydrodynamic analysis of T701-Myo1c
          Because the size of full-length Myo1c (125 kD,
          including purification and detection tags) is much larger
          than calmodulin (16.7 kD), we improved our ability to
          determine stoichiometry from molecular mass by examining
          a smaller (45 kD) neck-tail recombinant fragment of
          Myo1c. This construct, T701-Myo1c, contained amino acids
          701-1028 of bullfrog Myo1c, including all four IQ
          domains, the entire C-terminal tail, and N-terminal
          purification and epitope tags (Fig. 1A,1B).
          T701-Myo1c bound 2.5 moles of calmodulin per mole of
          heavy chain at 4°C in the presence of 100 μM EGTA (Fig.
          6; Table 4). As with full-length Myo1c, elevation of the
          analysis temperature to 25°C induced the release of ~0.7
          mole of calmodulin. In contrast to the results seen with
          full-length Myo1c, elevation of the CaCl 
          2 concentration to 25 μM at 4°C also
          induced the release of ~0.7 mole of calmodulin. The
          amount of T701-calmodulin complex recovered on sucrose
          gradients or by gel filtration decreased substantially
          when the CaCl 
          2 concentration was elevated to 25 μM
          at 25°C, signaling the formation of aggregates, as seen
          with the full-length complex. Furthermore, the calculated
          calmodulin stoichiometry of the observed T701-calmodulin
          complex under these conditions was only ~0.3 mole of
          calmodulin per mole of Myo1c, reinforcing the suggestion
          that Ca 2+induced the dissociation of most calmodulins at
          25°C and that this loss of light chains resulted in
          aggregation.
          We could not prevent the release of calmodulin at 25°C
          by saturating T701-Myo1c with excess calmodulin
          immediately prior to centrifugation (preloading). In
          EGTA, the sedimentation coefficient of
          calmodulin-preloaded T701-Myo1c measured at 25°C (3.85 ±
          0.07 S; n = 2) was nearly identical to that measured
          without preloading (3.83 S; Table 4). Likewise, the
          sedimentation coefficient of calmodulin-preloaded
          T701-Myo1c measured at 25°C and in 25 μM CaCl 
          2 (2.80 ± 0.42 S; n = 2) was similar
          to that measured without preloading (3.13 S; Table
          4).
          By contrast, we could prevent the
          temperature-dependent loss of calmodulin by carrying out
          sedimentation in the continuous presence of 5 μM
          calmodulin (Fig. 6C,6D; Table 5). Although gel-filtration
          analysis was impractical with this high calmodulin
          concentration, we assumed that the Stokes radius of
          T701-Myo1c in the presence of calmodulin was identical to
          the value obtained in the absence. Sedimentation at 25°C
          in EGTA gradients supplemented with 5 μM calmodulin
          resulted in the retention of ~3 calmodulins per
          T701-Myo1c. In 25 μM CaCl 
          2 , supplementation with 5 μM
          calmodulin resulted in ~1 calmodulin bound per
          T701-Myo1c. In addition, protein loss due to aggregation
          was minimal under these conditions.
        
        
          Myo1c-calmodulin stoichiometry by gel
          scanning
          To measure Myo1c-calmodulin stoichiometry by an
          independent method, we separated calmodulin standards and
          T701-Myo1c by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7A). Using densitometry, we
          quantified the staining intensity of the calmodulin
          standards to generate a standard curve (Fig. 7B) and
          determined the amount of calmodulin present in each
          T701-Myo1c sample. Applying the analysis described in
          Experimental Procedures and equation (13), we found an
          average of 2.6 ± 0.2 calmodulins per T701-Myo1c (mean ±
          standard error) in six experiments, three separate
          preparations analyzed in duplicate. This value was very
          close to the value of 2.5 ± 0.1 bound calmodulins
          determined independently by hydrodynamic analysis (Table
          4).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Calmodulin interaction with individual Myo1c IQ
          domains
          To examine how calmodulin binds to the Myo1c IQ sites,
          we developed two binding assays using a commercially
          available fluorescent calmodulin and individual IQ
          peptides. In one assay, we covalently attached peptides
          to plastic plates, then measured the amount of
          fluorescent calmodulin that remained unbound after
          incubation with the peptide-derivatized plate. This assay
          was simple and fast, and allowed us to measure binding
          under a wide variety of conditions. In our second assay,
          we exploited the empirical observation that the
          Alexa-calmodulin fluorescence intensity is quenched by
          binding of IQ peptides. As in other assays with
          fluorescently labeled calmodulins (e.g., ref. [ 31 ] ),
          binding of the peptides to Alexa-calmodulin did not
          perfectly mimic binding to unlabeled calmodulin. For
          example, Alexa-calmodulin bound IQ peptides more strongly
          in the presence of Ca 2+than did unlabeled calmodulin.
          Moreover, excess unlabeled calmodulin could not fully
          reverse the quenching of Alexa-calmodulin fluorescence
          induced by IQ peptides, suggesting that IQ peptides could
          bind to Alexa-calmodulin at two sites, including one
          where unlabeled calmodulin could not bind. Indeed,
          binding of IQ peptides to both sites on a single
          fluorescent calmodulin could account for Hill
          coefficients of >1 seen in some experiments (e.g.,
          Figs. 3Band 4). Nevertheless, these discrepancies should
          not prevent use of Alexa-calmodulin for measuring
          interaction with calmodulin's targets, particularly if
          the interaction with unlabeled calmodulin is compared to
          the interaction with Alexa-calmodulin.
          Calmodulin bound to peptides corresponding to each of
          the four Myo1c IQ domains, although with differing
          affinity and Ca 2+sensitivity. Affinities for calmodulin
          binding to IQ1 and IQ2 were relatively modest (K 
          d values of ~5 μM). As with other IQ
          domains [ 14 ] , Ca 2+weakened the affinity of calmodulin
          for IQ1 and IQ2 by more than 10-fold.
          By contrast, calmodulin binding to IQ3 was slightly
          stronger and was affected much less by Ca 2+. Because
          calmodulin binds strongly to classic IQ domains only in
          the absence of Ca 2+ [ 14 32 ] , its strong binding to
          IQ3 in the presence of Ca 2+suggests the participation of
          an additional Ca 2+-requiring binding motif. Two common
          calmodulin-binding motifs, called 1-8-14 and 1-5-10 for
          the pattern of hydrophobic amino-acid residues, require
          Ca 2+for calmodulin binding [ 14 ] . IQ3 has two nearly
          perfect 1-5-10 domains that are at +2 net charge instead
          of the minimum +3 in the consensus [ 14 ] . In addition,
          IQ3 has a 1-8-14 motif with a proline residue at position
          14 instead of phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine, valine,
          or tryptophan. Because most proteins that bind calmodulin
          through the 1-8-14 and 1-5-10 motifs do so strongly, the
          relatively modest affinity of IQ3 for calmodulin in the
          presence of Ca 2+suggests that calmodulin binds through
          one of these imperfect motifs located within this IQ
          domain. To interact with an alternate set of residues, Ca
          2+-calmodulin must adopt a new conformation. A similar Ca
          2+-dependent rearrangement was predicted for the complex
          of calmodulin and the first IQ domain of myosin-1a
          (brush-border myosin I) [ 32 ] .
          In support of this view, we observed evidence for Ca
          2+-dependent conformational changes in calmodulin while
          bound to IQ peptides. When Alexa-calmodulin was bound to
          Myo1c IQ peptides, its fluorescence was higher in the
          presence of Ca 2+than in its absence, suggesting that
          that Ca 2+-bound Alexa-calmodulin binds to the IQ
          peptides in a different conformation than does Ca 2+-free
          Alexa-calmodulin. For example, in the absence of Ca 2+,
          Alexa-calmodulin may bind to IQ peptides in a more
          compact conformation, quenching fluorescence by burying
          dye moieties in a less polar environment. Although the Ca
          2+-induced conformational change could be a property of
          Alexa-calmodulin rather than calmodulin itself, the Ca
          2+-dependent changes in affinity of calmodulin for IQ1
          and IQ2 (Table 2) and calmodulin's likely shift to a new
          binding site on IQ3 suggests that the conformational
          change is probably also a property of authentic
          calmodulin.
          Calmodulin also bound to a newly identified domain,
          IQ4. Because the affinity of calmodulin for IQ4 is very
          weak, calmodulin should only occupy IQ4 in subcellular
          locations with a low Ca 2+concentration and a high level
          of free calmodulin. For example, a small population of
          Myo1c molecules with calmodulin bound to IQ4 should be
          present in the stereocilia of inner-ear hair cells, which
          contain ~35 μM free calmodulin [ 33 ] . Although most
          tissues contain less free calmodulin [ 34 ] ,
          concentrations in other individual organelles can reach
          the millimolar range [ 35 ] . On the other hand, the weak
          affinity of this IQ domain for calmodulin suggests that
          IQ4 may play another role, such as interacting with
          another protein.
        
        
          Calmodulin interaction with Myo1c
          The binding affinities of calmodulin for the
          individual IQ peptides do not reflect exactly the
          affinities of calmodulin for the IQ domains within Myo1c.
          For example, despite micromolar K 
          d values for calmodulin-IQ peptide
          interactions, calmodulin remains bound to Myo1c during
          long gel-filtration or centrifugation experiments, even
          at nanomolar Myo1c concentrations (Fig. 6). This result
          suggests that calmodulin binds to some of Myo1c's four
          tandem IQ domains substantially more strongly than to the
          individual peptides. For example, other regions of Myo1c
          could constrain the IQ domains in conformations that are
          substantially more (or less) favorable for calmodulin
          binding than the population of conformations adopted by a
          soluble IQ peptide. Moreover, calmodulin binding to Myo1c
          could be influenced by interactions with adjacent
          calmodulin molecules or to the Myo1c head or tail
          domains.
          To examine calmodulin binding to IQ domains in Myo1c,
          we determined the molecular mass (and hence
          calmodulin:Myo1c stoichiometry) and shape of Myo1c under
          the appropriate conditions of temperature and Ca 2+.
          Although analytical ultracentrifugation is more commonly
          used to measure molecular size of protein-protein
          complexes [ 36 ] , we instead used classic hydrodynamic
          methods of velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients to
          obtain sedimentation coefficients and gel filtration to
          obtain Stokes' radius. One advantage of this approach was
          that by detecting Myo1c using a sensitive ELISA method,
          we were able to use very low concentrations of Myo1c.
          Furthermore, we were able to carry out sedimentation in
          the presence of a high concentration of calmodulin, a
          manipulation that prevents Myo1c detection in a standard
          analytical ultracentrifugation experiment. A disadvantage
          of this approach was the need for high concentrations of
          sucrose, which in rare conditions can substantially
          affect the hydrodynamic properties of a protein [ 37 ] ;
          nevertheless, changes in Myo1c size were observed both in
          velocity sedimentation (in the presence of sucrose) and
          in gel filtration (in its absence). Another disadvantage
          of our classic approach to molecular-mass determination
          was that the gel filtration and velocity sedimentations
          were done on different time scales (~1 hour vs. 15-18
          hours). If calmodulin slowly dissociated during the
          analysis (which in both assays diluted Myo1c well below 1
          μM), the degree of dissociation would be larger in the
          velocity sedimentation experiments than in the gel
          filtration experiments. Nevertheless, our approach was
          validated by the demonstration that the number of
          calmodulins per T701-Myo1c was identical in hydrodynamic
          and gel-scanning experiments, at least in EGTA at
          4°C.
          Because T701-Myo1c mimicked properties of the
          full-length protein (except under low-temperature,
          high-Ca 2+conditions), we exploited the neck-tail
          construct for a more detailed analysis of calmodulin
          binding. As expected from the large Ca 2+-dependent
          weakening of calmodulin affinity for IQ1 and IQ2 (Fig. 5;
          Table 2), Ca 2+decreased the number of calmodulins bound
          to T701-Myo1c at high ionic strength. When Ca 2+was low
          at 25°C, each T701-Myo1c had about two bound calmodulins,
          with a third bound if the calmodulin concentration
          reached 5 μM. At this calmodulin concentration, IQ
          domains 1, 2, and 3 are likely occupied by calmodulin.
          When Ca 2+is high at 25°C, all but one calmodulin
          dissociated from T701-Myo1c in the presence of 5 μM free
          calmodulin. The strong affinity of IQ3 for Ca
          2+-calmodulin suggests that the remaining calmodulin was
          bound to this IQ domain.
          How many calmodulins are bound to Myo1c in the cell at
          increased Ca 2+concentrations? The elevated ionic
          strength used for the hydrodynamic analysis probably
          weakened the affinity of the calmodulin for IQ3 (Fig.
          2A), requiring 5 μM free calmodulin to maintain occupancy
          of that site. We therefore infer that at a
          physiologically significant temperature and at a cellular
          ionic strength, Ca 2+triggers release of calmodulins from
          IQ1 and IQ2 from T701-Myo1c, leaving only IQ3 occupied.
          Although these results contrast with those reported for
          mammalian Myo1c, where only one of three calmodulins is
          released by Ca 2+ [ 19 38 ] , our T701 construct lacks
          Myo1c's motor domain. It is entirely plausible that even
          in the presence of Ca 2+, calmodulin remains bound to
          IQ1, albeit in a different conformation and dependent on
          interactions with the myosin head. Our results therefore
          suggest that Ca 2+either induces the release of
          calmodulin from IQ1 or causes it to change its
          interaction with Myo1c substantially.
          Of the three calmodulins bound to Myo1c, one of these
          binds relatively weakly at 25°C, even in EGTA. To which
          IQ domain does this weakly bound light chain bind?
          Although calmodulin binds to IQs 1-3 with approximately
          the same strength in the presence of EGTA, we suggest
          that the readily released calmodulin is likely to be that
          bound to IQ2. To bind three calmodulins, IQs 1-3, each of
          which are only 23 amino acids long, must be arranged
          without kinks [ 32 ] ; this arrangement may produce
          unfavorable strain on each of the calmodulin molecules.
          Release of calmodulin from IQ2 would relieve all of that
          strain; release from IQs 1 or 3 would not. Strain relief
          also may accelerate calmodulin release in the presence of
          Ca 2+; because Ca 2+apparently rearranges the
          three-dimensional interaction of calmodulin with IQ3,
          binding of an adjacent calmodulin - on IQ2 - might be
          destabilized even more [ 32 ] .
          Despite the loss of calmodulin from T701-Myo1c induced
          by elevation of the temperature from 4°C to 25°C, the
          frictional ratio (a measure of the protein's asymmetry)
          increased (Table 4). The neck-tail region of Myo1c thus
          appears to adopt a compact structure at 4°C, becoming
          more extended at 25°C. Less calmodulin may be released at
          lower temperatures because the Myo1c tail may bind to and
          stabilize calmodulin's interaction with the Myo1c
          neck.
        
        
          Implications for Myo1c activity
          The Ca 2+-dependent change in interaction of
          calmodulin with IQ1, the IQ domain closest to the motor
          domain, has important implications for Myo1c
          mechanochemical function. Although Ca 2+increases Myo1c
          ATPase activity, the ion completely halts 
          in vitro motility [ 19 ] . Ca
          2+-dependent changes in conformation may prevent
          amplification of a small converter-domain movement into a
          large motor step. In the presence of an external force,
          as is seen by Myo1c during an excitatory mechanical
          stimulus in a hair cell [ 39 ] , Ca 2+(which enters the
          cell through open transduction channels), should permit
          Myo1c to go through its ATPase cycle, binding and
          unbinding from actin, but the altered interaction of
          calmodulin and IQ1 may prevent force production by the
          motor. We predict that Ca 2+will decrease the stiffness
          of a Myo1c-actin interaction, preventing coupling of the
          energy released by ATP hydrolysis to the swing of the
          neck [ 40 ] . This behavior will assist Myo1c in its role
          of adaptation in hair cells, where the motor reduces
          force applied to the hair cell's transduction
          channel.
          A limitation of our experiments is the restriction of
          Myo1c binding to a single type of light chain,
          calmodulin. Other light chains can interact with IQ
          domains, including essential light chain isoforms [ 41 ]
          and calmodulin-like protein [ 42 ] . Although purified
          bovine adrenal Myo1c does not appear to have alternative
          associated light chains [ 12 ] , we can not rule out the
          possibility that other light chains bind in a cellular
          context. Nevertheless, purified recombinant full-length
          Myo1c associated with calmodulin light chains exhibited
          actin-activated ATPase activity and motility 
          in vitro [ 43 ] , indicating that
          calmodulin can function as a Myo1c light chain.
          That Myo1c does not bind calmodulin tightly is, at
          first glance, surprising. Weak calmodulin binding may,
          however, permit access of IQ domains to intracellular
          Myo1c receptors. Accordingly, we have found that a Myo1c
          fragment containing only IQs 1-3, partially complexed
          with calmodulin, binds avidly to hair-cell receptors;
          excess calmodulin blocks this interaction, probably by
          binding to an unoccupied IQ site on the Myo1c fragment [
          13 ] . IQ2 is highly conserved between species, leading
          us to propose that hair-cell receptors interact through
          this region [ 13 ] . Because Myo1c-interacting proteins
          in hair cells and elsewhere may interact through IQ
          domains, regulation of calmodulin binding to Myo1c - for
          example, by Ca 2+- likely affects coupling of the motor
          protein to its cargo.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Under low Ca 2+conditions and normal ionic strength,
        calmodulin binds moderately tightly to three Myo1c IQ
        domains, IQ1, IQ2, and IQ3. IQ4 will only be occupied when
        the calmodulin concentration is very high. When linearly
        arranged in the Myo1c molecule, at least one calmodulin
        (most likely that bound to IQ2) is bound less tightly,
        probably due to steric constraints. Upon binding Ca 2+,
        calmodulin bound to IQ2 dissociates; that bound to IQ1
        either dissociates or changes its conformation sufficiently
        that chemomechanical coupling cannot ensue.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Peptide - calmodulin interaction on plates
          Bullfrog Myo1c IQ peptides were synthesized (Genemed
          Synthesis, South San Francisco, CA) with N-terminal
          cysteine residues: IQ1 (residues 698-720),
          CRKHSIATFLQARWRGYHQRQKFL; IQ2 (721-743),
          CHMKHSAVEIQSWWRGTIGRRKAA; IQ3 (744-766),
          CKRKWAVDVVRRFIKGFIYRNQPR; and IQ4 (767-791; native
          cysteine at residue 767), CTENEYFLDYIRYSFLMTLYRNQPK.
          Peptide concentrations were measured by determining
          optical density at 280 nm, using calculated molar
          extinction coefficients of 7090 (IQ1), 11500 (IQ2), 7090
          (IQ3), and 5240 M -1cm -1(IQ4). We also synthesized a
          negative-control peptide ("PVP") corresponding to amino
          acids 792-816 of frog Myo1c (SVLDKSWPVPPPSLREASELLREMC;
          native C816) and a positive control IQ-peptide ("NM")
          corresponding to amino acids 29-52 of bovine neuromodulin
          with an added C-terminal cysteine
          (KAHKAATKIQASFRGHITRKKLKC) [ 24 ] .
          For measuring interaction of calmodulin with peptides
          conjugated to plastic plates, we incubated 10 μM peptide
          in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM
          KCl, 4.3 mM Na 
          2 HPO 
          4 , 1.4 mM KH 
          2 PO 
          4 , pH 7.4) overnight at room
          temperature in a maleimide-derivatized 96-well plate
          (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Peptide was present in large
          excess over free binding sites (25-50 pmol) on the
          plates. To remove unconjugated peptides, plates were
          washed with PBS; unreacted sites were saturated by
          incubating with 10 μg/ml cysteine for 1 hour. We then
          incubated the peptide-conjugated plates with 50 nM Alexa
          Fluor 488 calmodulin (Alexa-calmodulin; Molecular Probes,
          Eugene, OR) in 100 μl of a solution that contained 150 or
          400 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 
          2 , 100 μM ethylene
          glycol-bis(β-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid
          (EGTA) or 25 μM CaCl 
          2 , and 15 mM
          2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl] ethanesulfonic acid
          (HEPES) at pH 7.5. According to the manufacturer,
          Alexa-calmodulin had two dye moieties per calmodulin
          molecule; the modified residues were likely Lys-75 and
          Lys-94, the most reactive of calmodulin's lysine residues
          [ 44 ] . After incubation for 2 hours at room
          temperature, we transferred 50 μl of the solution to
          another 96-well plate and measured fluorescence
          (excitation 485 nm; emission, 520 nm) using a BMG
          Labtechnologies Fluorostar 403 microplate fluorometer
          (Durham, NC). Under the assay conditions, the
          inner-filter effect (absorption of excitation or emission
          photons by the sample) was negligible. From this
          measurement, we calculated the amount of calmodulin bound
          to the conjugated peptides. In some experiments, we also
          included 0.1-100 μM unconjugated IQ peptide; in that
          case, we carried out duplicate control reactions in
          underivatized 96-well plates to correct for fluorescence
          quenching exerted by IQ peptides.
        
        
          Peptide - calmodulin interaction by fluorescence
          quench
          We used empirically observed changes in the
          fluorescence intensity of Alexa-calmodulin, large in
          magnitude, to measure binding of IQ peptides to
          calmodulin. Peptides and 50-500 nM Alexa-calmodulin were
          mixed in 96- or 384-well microtiter plates with 150 mM
          KCl, 1 mM MgCl 
          2 , 100 μM EGTA or 25 μM CaCl 
          2 , 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin,
          and 15 mM HEPES at pH 7.5; in some experiments we added
          50-75 μM bovine-brain calmodulin. Total volume varied
          from 10 μl (384-well plates) to 100 μl (96-well plates).
          After 1-2 hours at room temperature, fluorescence was
          read directly.
          When IQ peptides bound to Alexa-calmodulin, the
          fluorescence intensity was reduced as the quantum yield
          decreased (fluorescence quenching). We assumed that two
          fluorescent species were present, Alexa-calmodulin and IQ
          peptide-bound Alexa-calmodulin, and that the fluorescence
          intensity ( 
          I ) was a linear combination of the
          fluorescence of the two species:
          
          I = 
          f 
          CaM 
          I 
          CaM + 
          f 
          CaM-IQ 
          I 
          CaM-IQ (1)
          where 
          f 
          CaM and 
          f 
          CaM-IQ are the mole fractions of the
          two components and 
          I 
          CaM and 
          I 
          CaM-IQ are their fluorescence
          intensities. Because the quantum yield of
          Alexa-calmodulin is reduced when IQ peptides bind, 
          I 
          CaM-IQ < 
          I 
          CaM . The fraction of peptide bound
          is:
          
          To calculate K 
          d , we fit the data with a
          bimolecular-binding isotherm:
          
          where [IQ] was the free IQ-peptide concentration
          added. Because we used concentrations of Alexa-calmodulin
          in our experiments that were much less than the K 
          d , we approximated [IQ] using the
          total IQ peptide concentration.
          In other cases, however, the binding data were fit
          better with a modified Hill equation:
          
          where 
          h is the Hill coefficient. A value
          for 
          h greater than one suggests the
          fluorescence change arose from a more complex equilibrium
          than just one peptide binding per calmodulin.
          To carry out stoichiometric-titration experiments
          (calmodulin concentration greater than the K 
          d ), we used a low concentration of
          Alexa-calmodulin as a reporter and added an excess of
          unlabeled calmodulin. For simplicity in analysis, we
          assumed that Alexa-calmodulin behaved identically to
          calmodulin, and thus this calmodulin mixture was
          equivalent to a decrease in specific activity
          (fluorescence quench) of calmodulin. We then solved the
          bimolecular-binding isotherm to enable us to plot the
          total ligand concentration ( 
          T ) added versus fluorescence
          intensity ( 
          I ). The concentration of peptide
          bound ( 
          B ) was:
          
          B = 
          m [CaM] 
          f 
          CaM-IQ (5)
          where 
          m is the number of binding sites
          per calmodulin and [CaM] is the fixed concentration of
          calmodulin. The free concentration of IQ peptide ( 
          F ) was 
          T - 
          B . We substituted the expression
          for 
          B in equations (2) and (5)
          into:
          
          Note that 
          n [CaM] is the maximum amount of IQ
          peptide that can bind (B 
          max ). We then solved equation (6) for
          fluorescence intensity using Mathematica 4.0 (Wolfram
          Research, Champaign, IL):
          
          For 
          m = 1, the only free parameters
          were K 
          d and 
          I 
          CaM-IQ . We were forced to include 
          I 
          CaM-IQ as one of the fit parameters;
          the limited solubility of IQ peptides in the assay
          solution prevented us from using very high peptide
          concentrations that would independently establish its
          value by producing a plateau in the 
          T vs. 
          I plot. We then used the value of 
          I 
          CaM-IQ determined from the 
          m = 1 fit and refit the data for 
          m = 2, using K 
          d as the only free parameter. To judge
          the stoichiometry, we compared by eye the effectiveness
          of the fit under the two conditions.
        
        
          Baculovirus constructs
          Using methods described previously for rat Myo1c [ 43
          ] , we cloned full-length bullfrog Myo1c into the
          baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBacHis2B (Invitrogen,
          Carlsbad, CA), introducing an N-terminal hexahistidine
          tag for purification and a DLYDDDDK epitope tag for
          antibody detection. Baculoviruses were generated,
          purified, and characterized using standard techniques [
          43 45 ] .
        
        
          Protein expression and purification
          Bullfrog Myo1c or its neck-tail fragment (Fig. 1A,1B)
          were co-expressed with 
          Xenopus calmodulin in Sf9 cells
          using methods described previously [ 43 ] . 
          Xenopus calmodulin is identical to
          all other sequenced vertebrate calmodulins, including
          bovine calmodulin [ 46 ] ; we presume that bullfrog
          calmodulin is also identical. Recombinant proteins were
          partially purified by centrifugation of an Sf9-cell
          extract and Ni 2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography [
          43 ] ; further purification was achieved using gel
          filtration at 4°C on a 25-ml Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column
          run at 0.5 ml/min in 400 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 
          2 , 100 μM EGTA, 15 mM HEPES pH 7.5
          with an AKTA-FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
          Piscataway, NJ). The concentration of each purified
          recombinant protein was calculated by measuring
          absorption at 280 nm and using extinction coefficients
          calculated from the appropriate aminoacid sequence using
          the ExPASy ProtParam tool
          http://www.expasy.ch/tools/protparam.html, assuming 2.5
          calmodulins per full-length Myo1c (53,619 M -1cm -1) or
          T701 fragment (65,565 M -1cm -1). We typically obtained
          100-300 μg of recombinant protein from ~10 9Sf9 cells.
          Full-length Myo1c had NH 
          4 Cl-activated ATPase activity [ 12 ]
          of 1.8 ± 0.7 s -1, with a K 
          m for ATP of 0.3 ± 0.1 mM. Actin
          activated basal Mg 2+-ATPase activity ~15-fold.
          Calmodulin was purified from bovine brain (Pel-Freez,
          Rogers, AR) by isoelectric precipitation and
          phenyl-agarose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) chromatography [ 47
          ] ; its concentration was measured assuming a molar
          extinction coefficient of 3030 M -1cm -1at 276 nm [ 48 ]
          .
        
        
          Gel filtration
          Stokes radii of Myo1c and T701-Myo1c were measured
          using gel filtration on a 25-ml Superdex 200 HR 10/30
          column at either 4°C or room temperature (23-25°C).
          Columns were run at 0.5 ml/min in 400 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 
          2 , 15 mM HEPES pH 7.5, and either 100
          μM EGTA or 25 μM CaCl 
          2 ; 5-20 μg of recombinant protein was
          applied to the column. Columns were calibrated using
          20-200 μg each of globular proteins of known Stokes radii
          (thyroglobulin, 8.50 nm; ferritin, 6.10 nm; catalase,
          5.22 nm; aldolase, 4.81 nm; bovine serum albumin, 3.55
          nm; ovalbumin, 3.05 nm; chymotrypsinogen, 2.09 nm; and
          RNase A, 1.64 nm; all obtained from Amersham Pharmacia
          Biotech). Proteins were detected by absorption at 280
          nm.
        
        
          Velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients
          Sedimentation coefficients of full-length and
          T701-Myo1c were measured using linear 5-20% sucrose
          gradients in 11.5 ml of 400 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 
          2 , 15 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.2 mM
          phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μM leupeptin, 10 μM
          pepstatin, and either 100 μM EGTA or 25 μM CaCl 
          2 . Gradients were calibrated with
          2-20 μg internal standards of known sedimentation
          coefficients (catalase, 11.3 S; bovine serum albumin,
          4.31 S; lysozyme, 1.91 S; all obtained from
          Sigma-Aldrich). After centrifugation at 33,000-40,000 rpm
          in an SW 41 rotor for 15-18 hours at 4°C or 25°C,
          gradients were fractionated from the bottom into ~30
          fractions. Calibration proteins were located using a
          Bradford protein assay [ 49 ] ; Myo1c-containing
          fractions were located by ELISA [ 43 ] using an antibody
          against the Myo1c tail (mT2/M2; ref. [ 50 ] ) or against
          the DLYDDDDK epitope tag (anti-Xpress; Invitrogen). To
          determine the location of protein peaks, plots of
          fraction number versus the levels of Myo1c or calibration
          proteins were fit with either one, two, or three Gaussian
          curves.
          For calmodulin preloading of T701-Myo1c, 10 μM
          purified calmodulin was incubated with 1 μM Myo1c in a
          solution containing either 100 μM EGTA or 25 μM CaCl 
          2 for 60 min at room temperature prior
          to centrifugation.
        
        
          Determination of molecular mass
          We used the modified Svedberg equation for
          molecular-mass determination:
          
          where 
          M = molecular mass, η = viscosity
          of the medium, 
          N = Avogadro's number, 
          a = Stokes radius, 
          s = sedimentation coefficient, =
          partial specific volume, and ρ = density of the medium.
          Partial specific volume was calculated from the
          composition of Myo1c or T701-Myo1c, along with the
          appropriate number of calmodulins, by summing the partial
          specific volumes of each amino acid [ 30 ] . We used η =
          1.002 × 10 -2g cm -1s -1and ρ = 0.998 g cm -3.
          Errors in molecular mass were propagated from standard
          deviations for Stokes radius and sedimentation
          coefficient measurements. To calculate error in
          calmodulin stoichiometry, we used the conservative
          assumption that all error in the molecular-mass
          measurement was due to variability in the number of
          calmodulins.
          The frictional ratio was determined from:
          
          where 
          f is the frictional coefficient of
          the Myo1c-calmodulin complex and 
          f 
          0 is the frictional coefficient of a
          sphere of equal volume. Accordingly, the frictional ratio
          of a globular protein will be 1; that of an elongated
          protein will be >1.
        
        
          Stoichiometry determination by gel scanning
          T701-Myo1c and bovine-brain calmodulin were separated
          by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
          and stained with Coomassie blue R250. Gels were scanned
          with a flatbed scanner; calmodulin was quantified using
          analysis of the resulting images with NIH Image version
          1.62. The concentration of the T701-Myo1c heavy chain was
          determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm, although
          the analysis was complicated by the uncertain calmodulin
          stoichiometry ( 
          p ). To circumvent this problem, we
          solved several simultaneous equations for 
          p . The molar extinction
          coefficient of the T701-Myo1c/calmodulin complex (ε 
          T701-CaM ) is given by:
          ε 
          T701-CaM = ε 
          T701 + 
          p ·ε 
          CaM (10)
          where ε 
          T701 is the extinction coefficient of
          the T701-Myo1c heavy chain alone (57,990 M -1cm -1), ε 
          CaM is the extinction coefficient of
          calmodulin (2560 M -1cm -1), and 
          p is the calmodulin:T701
          stoichiometry. The concentration of T701-Myo1c heavy
          chain is given by:
          
          where A280 is the absorbance of the complex at 280 nm
          for a 1 cm pathlength. Finally,
          
          p ·[T701 
          HC ] = [CaM] (12)
          where [CaM] is the calmodulin concentration determined
          by gel scanning. Solving for 
          p :
          
        
        
          Other methods
          We measured the free Ca 2+concentrations in our
          solutions using spectrofluorometry with Calcium Green-2
          (Molecular Probes). SDS-PAGE was carried out with 18%
          acrylamide Criterion gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories;
          Hercules, CA); gels were stained with Coomassie blue
          R250.
