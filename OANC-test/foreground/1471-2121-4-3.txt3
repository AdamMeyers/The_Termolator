        Mammalian protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) and its homolog
        protein phosphatase T1 (Ppt1p) from the yeast 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain a
        catalytic domain structurally related to the catalytic
        subunits of PP1, PP2A and PP2B, and an N-terminal domain
        consisting of multiple tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) not
        found in other members of this family of phosphatases [ 1 2
        3 ] . Homologs have also been identified in 
        Xenopus laevis [ 4 ] , 
        Neurospora crassa [ 5 ] , 
        Drosophila melanogaster [ 6 ] , 
        Trypanosoma brucei [ 7 ] , 
        Plasmodium falciparum [ 8 9 ] , and
        cauliflower [ 10 ] , and homologs for 
        Caenorhabditis elegans,
        Schizosaccharomyces pombe and 
        Arabidopsis thaliana are predicted
        (accession number CAB60937, CAA17690 and AAD21727,
        respectively).
        Protein phosphatase 5 has been implicated in the control
        of cell proliferation, in hormonal signal transduction, and
        in hsp90 chaperone function [ 3 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ] .
        However little is known about the regulation of PP5 or its
        specific role in these pathways, and only one physiological
        substrate for PP5 has been identified to date, the
        apoptosis signaling kinase ASK 1 [ 13 ] . PP5 can be
        activated by lipid 
        in vitro , and removal of the TPR
        domain or the C terminus generates an active, lipid
        insensitive form of the enzyme [ 18 19 20 21 ] . PP5
        phosphatase activity is also altered by hCRY2 and a
        fragment of hsp90 
        in vitro [ 21 22 ] . These findings
        suggest that PP5 may be autoinhibited and that the binding
        of protein partners or lipids to the TPR domain could
        potentially control PP5 activity in cells, however no
        reports have yet documented how PP5 is regulated 
        in vivo . The activity of PP5
        homologs from cauliflower, 
        T. brucei and 
        P. falciparum is stimulated by
        polyunsaturated fatty acids 
        in vitro [ 7 8 9 10 ] and removal of
        the TPR domain from 
        P. falciparum PP5 increases activity
        to the same extent as lipid treatment [ 8 9 ] . This
        suggests that the TPR domain plays a similar inhibitory
        role for all PP5 homologs.
        Genetic analyses in 
        S. cerevisiae have yielded few clues
        about the function of Ppt1p. Budding yeast lacking 
        PPT1 do not exhibit obvious growth
        defects or detectable phenotypes [ 2 ] . Disruption of 
        PPT1 together with one of the other
        known phosphatases in budding yeast also reveals no obvious
        phenotype [ 23 ] . Thus, if Ppt1p has an essential function
        in 
        S. cerevisiae , more than one other
        phosphatase can also carry out this role. In this report we
        have characterized the activity of recombinant Ppt1p,
        analyzed its expression at the level of protein and mRNA,
        and localized Ppt1p in yeast. Ppt1p can be activated by
        lipid, is most highly expressed in early log phase growth,
        and is present throughout the cell.
      
      
        Results
        
          Comparison of Ppt1p and PP5 activity and response
          to lipid treatment
          Recombinant Ppt1p expressed as a GST-fusion protein,
          then affinity purified and released from GST by thrombin
          cleavage yielded a single band of the expected molecular
          weight, 58 kDa (Fig. 1A). When assayed side-by-side, the
          basal specific activities for recombinant Ppt1p and PP5
          were similar toward the artificial substrates 32P-MBP and
          32P-casein, respectively (Fig. 1B). Like PP5, the
          dephosphorylation of 32P-MBP by Ppt1p was stimulated by
          arachidonic acid and other unsaturated fatty acids, but
          lipids lacking either a double bond or a carboxylate
          group were not effective (Table 1).
          In the case of pNPP hydrolysis, others have reported
          both saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl coenzyme A
          esters stimulate PP5 activity, with concentrations
          required for half-maximal stimulation approximately
          10-fold lower than those of their corresponding free
          fatty acids [ 21 ] . We therefore tested whether a
          saturated fatty acyl coenzyme A ester could also
          stimulate Ppt1p. Ppt1p activity toward 32P-MBP was
          stimulated by arachidoyl coenzyme A in a concentration
          range similar to that observed for AA, with half-maximal
          stimulation occurring at approximately 50 μM for
          arachidoyl coenzyme A and 75 μM for AA. However, in
          contrast to AA stimulation, Ppt1p activity dropped off
          sharply at 80 μM arachidoyl coenzyme A and higher.
          Similar results were observed for PP5 (data not shown).
          This suggests that double bonds are not required to
          observe the effect of fatty acyl coenzyme A esters.
          Unlike PP5, the activity of Ppt1p toward 32P-casein
          was not stimulated by AA, arachidoyl coenzyme A, or
          linoleoyl coenzyme A over a range in concentration from
          10-500 μM (Fig. 1Band data not shown). Other unsaturated
          fatty acids also failed to stimulate Ppt1p activity with
          this substrate (Table 1). These data indicate that Ppt1p
          is stimulated by polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as
          by a saturated fatty acyl coenzyme A derivative, toward
          some but not all substrates dephosphorylated by PP5.
        
        
          Limited proteolysis of Ppt1p
          Removal of the TPR domain of PP5 by limited
          proteolysis increases enzyme activity and the TPR domain
          binds lipid [ 7 8 9 19 20 ] . Using conditions similar to
          those employed with PP5, digestion of Ppt1p with trypsin
          in the absence of lipid produced a 44 kDa catalytic
          fragment that was stable for at least 30 min and a 20 kDa
          fragment that was degraded within 30 min (Fig. 2A).
          N-terminal sequence analysis showed that these fragments
          are derived from the catalytic and the TPR domains,
          respectively (Fig. 2A,2B). The crystal structure of the
          PP5 TPR domain revealed three TPRs followed by an
          extended α helix [ 24 ] , however Ppt1p was originally
          proposed to contain one additional TPR [ 2 ] . The
          pattern of proteolysis and sites of cleavage for Ppt1p
          are very similar to those seen with PP5 under these same
          conditions [ 19 ] . This indicates that Ppt1p also
          contains an accessible region linking the TPR and
          catalytic domains and is most consistent with the
          presence of three TPRs in Ppt1p. Limited tryptic
          proteolysis in the presence of 250 μM AA generated a
          distinct pattern of fragmentation (Fig. 2A). A 20 kDa
          fragment was observed at early times, but a series of
          four fragments ranging from 14-16 kDa appeared between 10
          and 30 min as the amount of the 20 kDa fragment
          decreased. These fragments, which are derived from the
          TPR domain, were not observed in the absence of AA,
          suggesting that lipid binding alters the conformation of
          this domain and its susceptibility to proteolysis. A
          similar change in susceptibility to proteolysis upon
          lipid binding was observed with PP5 [ 19 ] . As with PP5,
          only lipids that stimulated 32P-MBP dephosphorylation
          slowed degradation of the 20 kDa TPR fragment (Table
          1).
          Removal of the TPR domain from Ppt1p by trypsin
          treatment had no effect on its activity toward
          32P-casein, but increased activity toward 32P-MBP
          approximately two fold (Fig. 2C). AA did not stimulate
          32P-MBP dephosphorylation by Ppt1p after removal of the
          TPR domain (data not shown). Thus, lipids that activate
          Ppt1p alter the sensitivity of the TPR domain to
          proteolysis, and removal of the TPR domain causes a loss
          of the response of Ppt1p to lipid. However, removal of
          the TPR domain only modestly increases Ppt1p activity, in
          contrast to the 5-25 fold elevation reported after TPR
          removal from PP5 [ 19 20 ] . Although we cannot rule out
          the possibility that proteolyzed Ppt1p is unresponsive to
          lipid because it is unstable, the observations that the
          catalytic fragment remains undegraded and control
          activity is not decreased argue against this possibility.
          Alternatively, an inhibitory element in the linker region
          may remain after TPR domain removal.
        
        
          The effect of C-terminal truncation on Ppt1p
          activity
          Removal of 10-13 residues from the C terminus of PP5
          results in a highly active enzyme that is only modestly
          stimulated by lipid [ 19 ] . To examine the role of the C
          terminus in controlling Ppt1p phosphatase activity, a
          similar truncation mutant, Ppt1p (1-504), was expressed
          and characterized (Fig. 1Aand 3). Compared to full-length
          enzyme Ppt1p (1-504) exhibited a two-fold increase in
          control specific activity with both 32P-casein and
          32P-MBP. Lipid did not stimulate Ppt1p (1-504) toward
          32P-casein, but still increased activity with 32P-MBP
          12-fold. In contrast, C-terminal truncation of PP5
          activates the enzyme as extensively as lipid treatment,
          and little further activation is seen with lipid [ 19 ] .
          In the case of PP5, subtilisin digestion removed both the
          TPR domain and the C terminus [ 19 ] . The observation
          that C-terminal truncation increased Ppt1p activity
          toward both 32P-casein and 32P-MBP, but subtilisin
          digestion increased activity only toward 32P-MBP (see
          Fig. 2C) suggests that the C terminus of Ppt1p remained
          intact during subtilisin digestion. However, mass
          analysis of the subtilisin-derived catalytic fragment
          would be required to confirm this.
        
        
          Expression and localization of HA-Ppt1p in yeast
          cells
          To examine when Ppt1p is expressed and where it is
          localized, a yeast strain (WHT4-1) was generated in which
          the 
          PPT1 gene was replaced with cDNA
          encoding hemagglutinin-tagged Ppt1p (HA-Ppt1p).
          Immunoblotting showed that HA-Ppt1p levels were highest
          in early log phase, and then decreased dramatically
          during the stationary phase (Fig. 4A,4B). Northern
          analysis showed that the 
          PPT1 mRNA levels also increased in
          early log phase and decreased as the cell division
          decreased upon entering the stationary phase (Fig. 4C),
          correlating with protein expression. The pattern of 
          PPT1 gene expression was identical
          in wild-type cells and cells expressing HA-Ppt1p,
          indicating that the epitope tag did not alter
          transcription or message stability (data not shown).
          Cells in early log phase growth when 
          PPT1 gene expression was maximal
          were used to localize HA-Ppt1p. Indirect
          immunofluorescence was required to detect HA-Ppt1p.
          Fluorescence microscopy indicated that HA-Ppt1p was
          present throughout the cell, including the nucleus (Fig.
          5A). Localization and staining intensity did not appear
          to change as a function of bud size or morphology,
          suggesting that Ppt1p expression and localization is not
          cell cycle dependent.
          To confirm that the indirect immunofluorescence
          procedure did not generate artifacts, the localization of
          the spindle pole body protein Spc42p was also examined by
          this method. A yeast centromeric plasmid encoding the
          fusion protein Spc42p-EGFP was transformed into W303
          cells. Direct fluorescence from EGFP and indirect
          immunofluorescence using the amplification protocol with
          anti-EGFP antibody were compared. Both signals revealed
          specific localization of Spc42p-EGFP to the spindle pole
          body (Fig. 5B).
          When HA-Ppt1p or EGFP-Ppt1p was overexpressed from the
          
          GAL1 promoter in a centromeric or
          episomal plasmid, respectively, indirect
          immunofluorescence of HA-Ppt1p or direct fluorescence
          from EGFP-Ppt1p showed that both proteins were also
          localized throughout the cell.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        PP5 and its homologs in other species represent a
        subfamily of PPP enzymes distinguished by the presence of
        an N-terminal domain containing multiple TPR repeats. Ppt1p
        from the yeast 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the
        first homolog of mammalian PP5 to be described. Thus far,
        genetic approaches have not revealed functions for budding
        yeast Ppt1p. In this report, we have characterized Ppt1p
        activity 
        in vitro and examined its
        expression.
        In the case of mammalian PP5, results from lipid
        stimulation and binding, limited proteolysis and truncation
        studies taken together suggest the TPR domain and the C
        terminus inhibit PP5 activity in a coordinated manner and
        that lipid binding to the TPR domain activates the enzyme 
        in vitro [ 18 19 20 ] . In the
        present study we used assay conditions for Ppt1p identical
        to those in which PP5 was shown to be activated by removal
        of the TPR or C-terminal regions [ 19 ] . Under these
        conditions Ppt1p is also stimulated by lipids toward
        32P-MBP, and activating lipids slow TPR domain proteolysis.
        These results indicate that Ppt1p has a similar domain
        structure to PP5 and is activated in a similar manner by
        lipid binding to the TPR domain. Removal of the TPR domain
        prevents stimulation by lipid, but only modestly increases
        Ppt1p activity. Carboxyl-terminal truncation modestly
        increases Ppt1p activity toward both 32P-MBP and
        32P-casein, and does not prevent further lipid stimulation
        of 32P-MBP dephosphorylation. These results distinguish
        Ppt1p from mammalian PP5 and suggest that the C terminus is
        less important in controlling Ppt1p activity. Although more
        work will be required to determine its role in lipid
        stimulation, removal of the TPR domain had only a small
        effect on Ppt1p activation. Ppt1p contains two short
        stretches of amino acids, a 15-residue sequence between the
        linker helix and the catalytic domain (residues 174-188),
        and a ten-residue sequence just preceding the extreme C
        terminus (residues 474-484), that are not found in other
        PP5 homologs reported thus far ( [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ] ,
        and accession numbers CAB60937, CAA17690 and AAD21727). The
        presence of these additional sequences in Ppt1p may
        underlie the differences in the responses of Ppt1p and PP5
        to N or C-terminal truncation. Additional studies will be
        required to determine if our observations reflect
        structural and regulatory properties unique to Ppt1p.
        Ppt1p and PP5 exhibit similar specific activities toward
        32P-casein in the absence of lipid. However Ppt1p activity
        toward this substrate was not stimulated by lipids. These
        results highlight the fact that PPP enzymes often exhibit
        substrate specific effects 
        in vitro and that the use of a single
        substrate to study this family of enzymes can be
        misleading. Like PP5, the control activity of Ppt1p is low
        toward the commonly used artificial substrates such as
        32P-casein and 32P-MBP compared to other PPP enzymes [ 18 ]
        . Thus, it is not clear whether the selective lipid
        stimulation of Ppt1p toward 32P-MBP reflects a
        substrate-directed effect, or whether 32P-casein is simply
        a poor substrate for Ppt1p. Egloff and colleagues
        identified seven acidic surface residues on the catalytic
        face of PP1c γ that are replaced by neutral or basic
        residues in PP2A [ 25 ] . They suggest the presence of
        these acidic residues in PP1c γ may explain why casein is a
        good substrate for PP2A, but not for PP1. Based on a
        sequence alignment with PP1c γ, these seven acidic residues
        are not conserved in Ppt1p. Using the program Modeller [ 26
        ] , a homology model of the catalytic domain of Ppt1p was
        built based on three PP1 structures - PDB
        http://www.pdb.org [ 27 ] codes 1FJM [ 28 ] , 1IT6 [ 29 ]
        and 1JK7 [ 30 ] . This model shows that the catalytic face
        of Ppt1p is generally less acidic than that of PP1c γ and
        does not indicate the presence of other acidic residues
        that could act in the same fashion as those on PP1c γ. Thus
        the reason for low Ppt1p activity toward this acidic
        substrate may be more complex than can be explained by
        electrostatic repulsion.
        Others have proposed that fatty acyl coenzyme A esters
        are potential physiologic regulators of PP5, since these
        compounds stimulate pNPP hydrolysis by PP5 
        in vitro at physiologically relevant
        concentrations and are approximately 10-fold more potent
        than their free fatty acid counterparts [ 21 ] . Although
        we confirmed this observation using PP5 and pNPP (data not
        shown), in our hands similar levels of AA and arachidoyl
        coenzyme A were required for half-maximal stimulation of
        32P-MBP dephosphorylation in the case of both Ppt1p and
        PP5. Although more work is required to examine this issue
        thoroughly, our results suggest that the large differences
        in potency between free fatty acids and fatty acyl coenzyme
        A esters seen using pNPP may not extend to all protein
        substrates. In addition, it will be important to determine
        if lipids in any form play a role in the regulation of PP5
        or Ppt1p 
        in vivo .
        Ppt1p was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of 
        S. cerevisiae . No difference in
        compartmentalization or staining intensity in cells was
        observed as a function of cell or bud size. This suggests
        that the level or localization of Ppt1p is not controlled
        as a function of cell cycle progression. Both nuclear and
        cytoplasmic localization have been reported for other PP5
        homologs. In some cases, including 
        P. falciparum and HeLa cells, nuclear
        staining appeared more intense than cytoplasmic staining [
        2 9 ] . Based on studies with heterologously expressed
        human PP5-GFP fusion proteins, it has been proposed that
        nuclear localization requires a stretch of sequence in the
        C terminus [ 31 ] . However, other sequences or signals are
        also likely to contribute to nuclear localization of PP5
        and its homologs, since rat and mouse PP5, which are
        identical to human PP5 in this region do not appear to be
        nuclear in all cell types [ 32 33 ] . In addition 
        P. falciparum PP5 is primarily
        nuclear [ 9 ] , although it is not well conserved in the
        relevant C-terminal region but contains a potential
        bipartite nuclear localization signal not found in other
        PP5 sequences reported thus far. The functional
        significance of differential localization is not known at
        this time.
        Ppt1p levels are highest during periods of rapid growth
        and drop off when growth slows (Fig. 4B), raising the
        possibility that this enzyme may have a role in controlling
        cell growth [ 34 ] and its expression may be regulated by a
        metabolic or nutritional signal [ 35 ] . The observation
        that Ppt1p levels rose and fell in parallel with mRNA
        levels suggests that Ppt1p expression is primarily
        controlled at the level of gene transcription. Studies of
        PP5 and its homologs in cultured cells and various
        organisms also suggest it may play a role in development [
        5 6 ] or during rapid cell growth [ 2 7 ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        Ppt1p shares several biochemical properties with PP5 and
        other homologs, including a similar domain structure and
        stimulation by lipid 
        in vitro . Unlike PP5, Ppt1p is not
        fully activated by removal of the TPR domain or by removal
        of 9 C-terminal residues, suggesting that these regions may
        not play an autoinhibitory role in Ppt1p. Ppt1p is
        expressed in early log phase growth and decreases
        dramatically as cells approach the stationary phase,
        suggesting that Ppt1p could play a role in cell growth or
        may be controlled by metabolic or nutritional signals. Like
        PP5, the observation that Ppt1p is localized in both the
        nucleus and cytoplasm implies that it may function in
        several subcellular compartments.
        Although our findings suggest some differences may exist
        in regulatory properties of Ppt1p and PP5, many biochemical
        and cellular properties are shared. In addition a recent
        report has shown that Ppt1p is co-purified with Hsp82p and
        Hsc82p, the 
        S. cerevisiae homologs of hsp90 [ 36
        ] , indicating that Ppt1p and PP5 have at least one common
        protein partner and suggesting that, like PP5, Ppt1p
        functions in chaperone complexes. Thus, 
        S. cerevisiae Ppt1p is likely to be a
        valuable model for probing the cellular role of PP5.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Materials
          Restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were
          purchased from New England Biolabs, Promega or Gibco BRL.
          Reagents for bacterial and yeast culture were purchased
          from Difco. All other materials were from Sigma unless
          otherwise noted. The yeast centromeric plasmid encoding
          the Spc42p-EGFP fusion protein was a kind gift from
          Younghoon Oh and Dr. Harry Charbonneau (Department of
          Biochemistry, Purdue University).
        
        
          Cloning and expression of recombinant Ppt1p, Ppt1p
          (1-504), and PP5 in E. coli
          PP5 was expressed and purified as described previously
          [ 18 ] . To generate the expression plasmid pET-GST-PPT1,
          
          Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic
          DNA was used as template in a polymerase chain reaction
          (PCR) with 
          PPT1 -specific oligonucleotide
          primers, (5' primer, 5'-ATGtcaacacccacagcagcagat; 3'
          primer, 5'-CTAtaaaccaaaaccaccattagaa) that contained
          initiation and stop codons, respectively. A PCR product
          containing the full-length 
          PPT1 coding region was then cloned
          into the 
          Eco RV restriction site of pBII KS
          - (Stratagene) and sequenced. A fragment containing the 
          PPT1 ORF was excised from the
          pBII-PPT1 using 
          Eco RI and 
          Xho I restriction enzymes and was
          subcloned downstream of the GST coding region into the 
          Eco RI and 
          Sal I sites of the bacterial
          expression vector pET-21a GST [ 37 ] . To construct the
          pET-GST-PPT1 (1-504) plasmid a 453 bp fragment was
          amplified from pET-GST-PPT1 by PCR using a 3' primer
          containing a 
          Xho I restriction site and a stop
          codon designed to truncate the 
          PPT1 gene product at Met504
          (5'-gatcctcgagTTAcattggttttatatctggg) and a 5' primer
          (5'-gtaatgcatggtggttta) encompassing the 
          Nsi I restriction site of 
          PPT1 . The PCR product was cloned
          into the 
          Nsi I and 
          Xho I restriction sites of
          pET-GST-PPT1 and sequenced. Each construct was
          transformed into 
          E. coli strain BL21 (DE3)
          (Novagen), and protein was expressed, purified by
          glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography, cleaved from
          GST and stored in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.6 at 4°C), 50%
          glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4 mM MnCl 
          2 at -20°C as previously described for
          PP5 [ 18 ] . Recombinant Ppt1p and Ppt1p (1-504) each
          contain an additional seven residues,
          Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser-Glu-Phe-Asp, which are remnants of the
          thrombin-cleavage site. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie stained
          gels showed that full-length Ppt1p and Ppt1p (1-504) each
          constituted more than 95% of the purified protein (Fig.
          1A).
        
        
          Phosphatase assays
          32P-labeled substrates were prepared and assays
          performed as described previously [ 18 ] . Briefly,
          protein phosphatase reactions contained 2 or 4 nM enzyme
          in a final volume of 30 μl containing buffer A (50 mM
          Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1%
          2-mercaptoethanol), 0.4% ethanol and 10 μM radiolabeled
          phosphosubstrate in the absence or presence of AA [ 19 ]
          . Reactions were initiated by adding substrate and lipid,
          and incubated at 30°C for 10 to 15 min. The phosphate
          released from each substrate was less than 20% of the
          total present. The amount of ethanol added to
          lipid-stimulated or control samples had no effect on
          activity.
        
        
          Limited proteolysis of Ppt1p
          Recombinant protein was incubated with either trypsin
          (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or subtilisin (Roche
          Molecular Biochemicals) in the absence or presence of 250
          μM lipid for 0 to 30 min at 30°C, as previously described
          [ 19 ] . To assess phosphatase activity, an aliquot of
          the digestion reaction was diluted in buffer A containing
          either 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor for trypsin,
          or 2 mM PMSF for subtilisin and assayed. Matched samples
          from the proteolysis reaction were quenched with
          trichloroacetic acid (10%, w/v), protein was sedimented,
          then boiled in (75 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10%
          glycerol, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.01% bromophenol
          blue), subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10 or 15% resolving
          gels, and protein bands visualized by Coomassie staining.
          For zero time points, samples were withdrawn before the
          addition of protease but were otherwise identical.
        
        
          N-terminal sequence analysis of proteolytic
          fragments
          Proteolytic fragments separated by SDS-PAGE were
          transferred to ProBlott PVDF membranes (Applied
          Biosystems, Inc.) as described by LeGendre 
          et al [ 38 ] . Coomassie-stained
          protein bands were then subjected to sequence analysis
          using either a Model 491 or Model 470A gas phase
          sequencer equipped with a Model 120A on-line
          phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc).
          Sequence analysis was performed in the Purdue
          Macromolecular Structure Facility.
        
        
          Cloning, subcloning, and gene replacement for the
          expression of HA-Ppt1p in yeast cells
          For expression of HA-tagged Ppt1p under control of the
          
          GAL1 promoter, a 
          PPT1 DNA fragment was cut from
          pET-GST-PPT1 by 
          EcoR I and 
          Not I digestion and subcloned into
          the 
          EcoR I/ 
          Not I-digested YCpIF16 (ATCC No.
          87091), a centromeric plasmid. The resulting plasmid,
          YCpIF16-PPT1, was transformed into yeast W303 cells ( 
          MAT 
          a , 
          can1-100, leu2-3,112, his3-11,15,
          trp1-1, ura3-1, ade2-1 ). Transformed cells were
          grown in SC-Trp medium at 30°C to OD 
          600 nm 0.5, washed twice to remove
          glucose, then grown in SG-Trp medium containing 2%
          galactose instead of glucose for 12-16 hr at room
          temperature to induce protein expression.
          A strain expressing HA-Ppt1p was made using the
          two-step gene replacement strategy [ 39 ] . First, the
          upstream sequence of 
          PPT1 (-955 to -1) was amplified
          from yeast genomic DNA by PCR using a 5' primer
          containing a 
          Kpn I restriction site
          (5'-gatcGGTACCattagcacggtgccttaacca-3') and a 3' primer
          containing a 
          Xho I site and HA coding sequence
          (5'-gatcCTCGAGatcgataccgtcgagctagcgtagtctgggacgtcgtatgggtatcgactcatATTCGAGATATTTGATTATACCAAGGC-3').
          In the 3' primer, the sequence from the 
          Xho I restriction site to the HA
          coding sequence was identical to that present in YCpIF16.
          The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into pRS306 (New
          England Biolabs, Inc.) using 
          Kpn I and 
          Xho I restriction sites to generate
          pRS306-955HA. Then, a fragment containing the 
          PPT1 ORF was excised from
          YCpIF16-PPT1 by 
          Xho I and 
          Not I digestion and subcloned into
          this plasmid to form pRS306-955HAPPT1. The plasmid was
          linearized by 
          Bam HI digestion, transformed into
          the yeast strain, W303, and the transformed cells were
          plated on a SC-Ura plate. The resulting colonies were
          then grown in YPAD media (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone,
          0.04% adenine, and 2% glucose) and plated on 5-FOA plates
          to select clones emerging by a second recombination event
          that eliminated the 
          URA3 gene together with the
          additional copy of 
          PPT1 . To confirm gene replacement,
          chromosomal DNA from these clones was used for PCR
          amplification of the region encoding HA-Ppt1p. Amplified
          product was then analyzed by 
          Xho I digest, which can only cut
          amplified product from the replaced gene.
        
        
          Immunoblotting and immunocytochemical analysis of
          HA-Ppt1p expression
          Wild type (W303) cell and WHT4-1 cells were grown in
          YPAD medium. The expression of HA-Ppt1p was detected by
          immunoblot using the 12CA5 monoclonal anti-HA antibody
          (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The total protein was
          extracted from approximately 10 7cells by vortexing with
          glass beads, then resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% gel, and
          transferred to nitrocellulose at 55V in (25 mM Tris, 250
          mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol) for 1 hr at room
          temperature. The membrane was blocked with 3% non-fat dry
          milk (Bio-Rad), 0.1% tween-20 in TBS (pH 7.4), then cut
          at molecular weight marker 45 kDa. The upper half was
          probed with anti-HA antibody (4 μg/ml), followed by
          HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000, CalBiochem), and
          the signal was detected using ECL reagents (Amersham
          Pharmacia Biotech UK Ltd.). The lower half was probed
          with anti-Cdc28p antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to
          ensure that an equal amount of protein was loaded in each
          lane. The relative level of HA-Ppt1p expression was
          determined by comparing the band intensity of HA-Ppt1p to
          that of Cdc28p using ImageQuant software version 5.1
          (Molecular Dynamics).
          Cells were prepared for immunocytochemistry as
          described by Harlow and Lane [ 40 ] . Briefly, WHT4-1
          cells were grown to early log-phase (OD 
          600 nm 1.0-1.5), fixed by 4%
          para-formaldehyde, and the cell wall was removed by
          treatment with β-glucuronidase and zymolase. The
          resulting spheroplasts were attached to poly-L-lysine
          coated coverslips and treated with cold methanol, then
          acetone. After blocking non-specific binding sites with
          3% BSA, 0.1% tween-20 in PBS, the coverslips were
          incubated with anti-HA (40 μg/ml) or anti-GFP antibody
          (40 μg/ml), rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Pierce, 1:200),
          biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories,
          1:200), and streptavidin conjugated with either Alexa 488
          or Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes, 1:200). After staining
          nuclei with 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), the
          coverslips were mounted on slides using ProLong anti-fade
          reagent (Molecular Probes). The specimens were examined
          with a BX60 fluorescence microscope (Olympus) and images
          captured using a RT220 color digital camera (Diagnostic
          Instruments, Inc.). W303 cells treated in the same manner
          were used as a negative control.
        
        
          Northern blot analysis of PPT1mRNA
          Total RNA was prepared from W303 and WHT4-1 yeast
          cells using hot acid phenol extraction [ 41 ] . For
          electrophoresis, 20 μg of RNA per sample was resolved on
          a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde at 5V/cm
          until the bromophenol blue migrated 8 cm. The gel was
          rinsed with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H 
          2 O and the RNA was transferred to a
          Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary
          transfer in alkaline solution (0.01 N NaOH, 3 M NaCl) for
          overnight. The membrane was pre-hybridized with
          PERFECTHYB PLUS solution (Sigma) at 68°C for 1 hr, and a
          cDNA probe for 
          PPT1 was added and incubated at
          42°C for overnight. The cDNA probe was prepared by
          restriction digestion of pET-GST-PPT1 with 
          Bsm I and 
          Nco I. The 879 bp DNA fragment
          generated, corresponding to 544-1422 of 
          PPT1 coding sequence, was
          gel-purified and labeled with 0.67 μM [α- 32P] CTP (3000
          Ci/mmol) using the DECAprimeII random priming kit
          (Ambion) according to the user manual. After washing with
          1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at room temperature and 0.2
          × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min three times at 68°C, the
          membrane was exposed to a storage phosphor screen GP
          (Kodak) or x-ray film (BMS 1, Kodak). The membrane was
          stripped in 50% formamide, 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 hr
          at 68°C, and reprobed with a cDNA for 
          ACT1 (yeast actin gene). The DNA
          fragment corresponding 214-694 of actin coding sequence
          was amplified by PCR using yeast genomic DNA as template
          and 
          ACT1 -specific oligonucleotide
          primers (5' primer,
          5'-gaacacggtattgtcaccaactgggacgatatgg; 3' primer,
          5'-gagcagcggtttgcatttcttgttcgaagtcc). The 481 bp DNA
          fragment was labeled and used essentially as described
          for the 
          PPT1 probe. The storage phosphor
          screen was scanned using Typhoon scanner (Molecular
          Dynamics), and the relative level of 
          PPT1 message was determined by
          comparing the band intensity of 
          PPT1 mRNA to that of actin mRNA
          using ImageQuant software version 5.1 (Molecular
          Dynamics).
