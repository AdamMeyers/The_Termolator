        Embryological literature includes a broad array of
        descriptions of development in one organism or another. A
        monophyletic ancestry for the vertebrates, with the
        possible exception of cyclostomes, implies that some common
        inherited mechanistic themes exist for development.
        Differences ought to reflect either adaptations for various
        environmental conditions or nonadaptive (not maladaptive)
        traits that appeared in conjunction with genetic drift,
        quantum speciation, or punctuated equilibrium. Common
        themes and significant differences in developmental
        patterns should appear through the study of as many
        vertebrates as possible, chosen from a list of diverse
        types. Phylogeny and ontogeny support each other in this
        context [ 1, 2]. Comparative studies also help us to
        identify model systems that are perhaps better suited than
        more common ones to answer difficult biological questions.
        Development in many of the approximately fifty orders of
        fishes remains unknown. This paper will help, in part, to
        fill the knowledge gaps.
        The longnose gar, 
        Lepisosteus osseus, also known as the
        garpike, is one of four living species of its genus within
        the Osteichthyian division Ginglymodi (infraclass
        Neopterygii). They are restricted to the Western
        Hemisphere. Wiley [ 3], using vicariance biogeography,
        placed a 180 million-year age on the genus, which arose
        before the breakup of Pangaea. Their adult anatomy and
        distribution have been used to construct phylogenies for
        actinopterygian evolution, and details of their embryonic
        development are likely to have similar usefulness.
        Most previous work on the early embryonic development of
        
        Lepisosteus was performed before
        1912, and codified by Agassiz [ 4], Balfour and Parker [
        5], Dean [ 6], Eycleshymer [ 7, 8] and Lanzi [ 9]. Lack of
        modern (by today's standards) laboratory facilities and
        equipment were handicaps to those studies. Much of the
        description of early embryonic development in the garpike
        is based on material that was badly distorted by harsh
        fixation procedures. Moreover, the embryos, themselves,
        might have been unhealthy; they were sometimes raised under
        sub-optimal conditions. Cell-marking techniques had not
        been devised at the time, so inferences made about
        gastrulation movements or blastomere fate could not be
        tested experimentally. Recent embryological study of the
        garpike either has been restricted to the development of
        specific structures in older embryos, e.g. [ 10], or has
        been reported in sketchy fashion ancillary to studies with
        another purpose, e.g. [ 11].
        We took a fresh look at this animal to describe in
        familiar terms the sequence of events during its
        development. Relatively recent information similar to what
        we report here is known for four other basal fishes among
        the Actinopterygii, namely: paddlefish (Osteichthyes :
        Chondrostei: Acipenseriformes); sturgeon (Osteichthyes :
        Chondrostei: Acipenseriformes); bichir (Osteichthyes :
        Chrondrostei: Polypteriformes); and bowfin (Osteichthyes :
        Halecostomi: Amiiformes). Studies of those groups [ 12, 13,
        14, 15, 16, 17] illustrated the marked differences in
        development among them. For example, development of the
        sturgeon is relatively frog-like and the bowfin is much
        more similar to teleosts in its gastrulation pattern. We
        found that garpike development differs from that of the
        basal fish listed above, as well as teleosts.
        One of us (Long) has engaged an experimental study of
        morphogenetic cell movements in 
        L. osseus, which largely occupy
        stages 9-15 described here, see [ 18]. Interpretation of
        that and other studies will require the structural and
        temporal framework provided by this staging description.
        This normal series of developmental stages partly is a
        contribution to the body of science, and partly is a common
        reference point that will enable other investigators to use
        the garpike in their own laboratories.
      
      
        Results
        
          Rate of development
          (Fig. 1) - The developmental rate for 
          Lepisosteus, as is common for fish,
          proceeds at a pace dictated partly by the developmental
          program and partly by temperature. Our temperature
          control regime was of necessity weather-related, for
          specimens were raised either on a water table or in
          running lakewater. Developmental rates under such
          conditions can be measured fairly accurately over a short
          time period of up to several hours; but their accuracy
          suffers over longer periods because of environmental
          temperature fluctuations. We list short-term rates for
          early stages of development, at several temperatures, in
          the following paragraphs. Longer-term rates are shown in
          figure 1, which is based on selected developmental stages
          for a single batch of eggs taken in 1983. The
          temperatures listed each represent the average of two
          temperature readings taken in the running lakewater
          system every day, at 9 AM and 9 PM. Water temperature, at
          any time during a 24-hour period, fluctuated as much as a
          degree away from the average, i.e. warmer during the day
          and cooler at night. Development for this batch was not
          timed past six days because travel arrangements precluded
          it.
        
        
          Stage 1, one cell
          (Fig. 2A, 2B) - This stage begins at fertilization and
          lasts until the first cleavage furrow is readily visible,
          about three hours post-fertilization at 17°. The eggs are
          spherical, about 3 mm in diameter. As with other fish
          species, there is some variation in egg size from
          female-to-female. We measured a range of 2.8-3.1 mm for
          batches from various females. The eggs become quite
          sticky when they are placed in water, and adhere firmly
          to whatever substrate is available. This is true even for
          those that remain unfertilized.
          The egg envelopes enlarge slowly over the next hour,
          revealing a narrow perivitelline space about 0.1 mm wide.
          A cushioning, nonadhesive jelly fills the perivitelline
          space. The principle envelope that surrounds the egg is
          the chorion, derived from the vitelline envelope of the
          unfertilized ovum. It is clear, allowing the egg to be
          viewed easily. This layer has similar optical and
          mechanical properties to the chorion of the medaka, 
          Oryzias latipes, though it lacks
          the medaka's characteristic filamentous ornamentation. A
          second layer of jelly surrounds the chorion. This jelly
          layer is of variable thickness, up to 0.3 mm, and it
          provides the sticky character of the eggs.
          Dean [ 6] described "slaty gray" eggs. This is true,
          except that each has a white blastodisc at the animal
          pole. The intersection of the white and gray regions
          establishes a distinctly visible border for the
          blastodisc. The blastodisc, itself, is about 2.3 mm in
          diameter and occupies about 100° of the egg's
          circumference. A dimple occurs at its apex, and marks the
          animal pole. The dimple is the point of sperm entry. It
          lies immediately adjacent to the micropyle, which is
          easily seen in the chorion and jelly layers.
          Loosening of the vitelline envelope from the egg
          surface at fertilization allows gravity- induced egg
          rotation to occur, but the rotation is quite slow,
          perhaps impeded by the perivitelline jelly's thick
          consistency. It takes two hours or more to complete.
        
        
          Stage 2, two cells
          (Figs. 2C, 10A) - This stage begins with appearance of
          the first cleavage furrow, about four hours after
          fertilization at 17° (2 hours at 21°, 5.5 hours at 14°).
          The furrow first appears at the animal pole, and
          gradually extends to the edge of the blastodisc, which we
          now call the blastoderm. It will ultimately cut further,
          but by then subsequent furrows appear. Cleavage in this
          species is meroblastic; furrows divide the blastoderm
          similar to the teleosts. Unlike the teleostean pattern,
          however, the cleavage furrows continue past the
          blastoderm margin as grooves in the yolk cell surface.
          The first two grooves sometimes meet at the vegetal pole,
          but we found no evidence in living or fixed eggs that
          they extend significantly beneath the yolk cell cortex.
          This phenomenon led to some confusion in 19 thcentury
          literature concerning whether garpike cleavage is
          holoblastic or meroblastic. It is meroblastic.
        
        
          Stage 3, four cells
          (Fig. 2D) - The second cleavage furrow appears about 6
          hours after fertilization at 17° (9 hours at 14°). Dean [
          6] reported its appearance at three-hours, but his
          specimens were subject to an uncertain temperature
          regimen. The second furrow proceeds like the first,
          dividing the blastoderm deeply and extending past its
          margin outward across the gray yolk cell. Like the first
          groove, this one will ultimately reach the vegetal pole
          in some specimens.
        
        
          Stage 4, eight cells
          (Figs. 2E, 10B) - The paired third cleavage furrows
          appear about 7.5 hours post-fertilization at 17° (10.5
          hours at 14°). They are generally parallel to the first
          furrow, and produce two rows of four blastomeres each.
          However, a few specimens (up to 10% in some batches of
          eggs) show an oblique third-cleavage orientation that
          produces a morula with a rosette of blastomeres at its
          animal pole. Dean first reported this in 1895 [ 6].
          The first cleavage groove extends to the egg's equator
          by now, while the second meets the blastoderm margin. The
          vegetal half of the morula, the future yolk cell, still
          exhibits a smooth surface.
        
        
          Stage 5, 16-32 cells
          (Figs. 2F, 10C) - The fourth round of cleavage begins
          about 11 hours post-fertilization at 17° (12 hours at
          14°), and lasts for about two hours. By now, the first
          cleavage groove reaches halfway between the equator and
          the vegetal pole.
        
        
          Stage 6, 64-512 cells
          (Fig. 3A, 3B, 3C) - This stage begins the blastula
          phase of garpike development. Cleavage divisions carry
          the blastula from 64 to 512 cells. In a 64-cell embryo,
          about 30 complete blastomeres appear on the surface,
          surrounded by marginal cells that are continuous with the
          yolk cell. Many central blastomeres are also separated
          from the yolk cell by tangential cleavage divisions.
          Dissection shows that the deep blastoderm cells are still
          connected to the yolk cell, and appear to bud from
          it.
        
        
          Stage 7, small-cell blastula
          (Fig. 3D) - The surface of the blastoderm has acquired
          a lumpy appearance, which indicates the steady decrease
          in blastomere size. An enveloping cell layer can be
          distinguished. Many deep cells lie beneath the enveloping
          layer. Cleavage furrows on the yolk cell are regressing
          by this time; they extend only to the egg's equator, no
          further.
        
        
          Stage 8, smooth-surfaced blastula
          (Fig. 3E) - This is the final stage before epiboly.
          Embryos reach it by about 20 hours at 17° (16 hours at
          20°). Superficial blastomeres are tiny and the blastoderm
          surface consists of a thin enveloping layer, similar to
          that in teleosts. The yolk furrows gradually regress
          until they are no longer visible.
          A virtual, uninflated, segmentation cavity forms,
          floored with large yolky cells. In many specimens, the
          blastoderm forms a peaked mound at the animal pole. The
          blastoderm has an irregular rim and a flat bottom where
          it joins the yolk cell. Dissection reveals a continuing
          presence of deep central cells that appear to be budding
          from the yolk cell. Many of them show broad connections
          with the yolk cell, and many join it via a narrow
          stalk.
        
        
          Stage 9, epiboly begins
          (Fig. 3F) - The blastoderm begins epiboly by 36 hours
          at 18°, but has not reached the egg's equator. Some
          specimens show the first indication of dorsal/ventral
          asymmetry, as a result of a lag in epiboly of the dorsal
          blastoderm margin. This produces a slight bulge in the
          blastoderm margin at that location, as though epiboly
          were being retarded by its attachment to the yolk cell.
          The bulge is the first external expression of the
          embryonic shield. The germ ring appears internally at
          this stage as well.
          Dissected specimens reveal an extensive subgerminal
          cavity, whose floor is paved by large yolky cells that
          are adherent to the yolk syncytial layer 
          (ysl). The blastoderm can be
          cleanly separated (by dissection) from the 
          ysl surface beneath the germ ring
          and embryonic shield, but the deep yolky cells at the
          animal pole adhere to the 
          ysl. Some of them are difficult to
          remove, for they are still attached by stalks to the yolk
          cell.
        
        
          Stage 10, epiboly reaches the equator
          (Figs. 3G, 10D) - The hint of dorsal/ventral asymmetry
          seen at stage 9 is now definite. The blastoderm overhangs
          its margin at the dorsal midline, having a crinkled edge
          where it attaches to the yolk cell. The overhang appears
          similar to the dorsal blastopore lip in amphibian
          embryos, and we give it that name. The exposed yolk cell
          surface beneath the dorsal lip is the first external
          appearance of the yolk syncytial layer.
        
        
          Stage 11
          (Fig. 4A, 4B) - The blastoderm reaches 1/3 the
          distance from the equator to the vegetal pole. The germ
          ring is wide, approaching 1 mm; and the embryonic shield
          is broader still.
          The external 
          ysl now occupies a greater portion
          of the blastoderm margin, and is broader at the dorsal
          midline than elsewhere. Viewed from the dorsal side, the
          blastoderm margin at the dorsal lip has the appearance of
          a horseshoe; its sidewalls face each other.
          Deep cells anterior to the future forebrain region
          begin to migrate away from the animal pole, producing an
          evacuation zone that is devoid of cells. The evacuation
          zone is not visible in living specimens at this stage,
          and some deep cells still remain tightly attached to the 
          ysl at the animal pole. The zone
          ultimately enlarges to a diameter of 1 mm at stage
          14.
        
        
          Stage 12
          (Fig. 4C) - The blastoderm margin reaches 2/3 the
          distance from equator to vegetal pole. The dorsal lip
          overhangs a pit floored by the external 
          ysl, a virtual gastrocoel. The
          embryonic shield extends above the equator. It can be
          dissected into two principal layers, the epiblast and the
          hypoblast. The roof of the evacuation zone at the animal
          pole is much thinner than before. The exposed surface of
          the yolk cell now comprises a large yolk plug.
        
        
          Stage 13
          (Fig. 4D) - The yolk plug is half or less the diameter
          of the equator. The germ ring is narrow now and the
          embryonic shield is longer, nearly reaching to the
          evacuation zone above the equator. There is a hint of a
          neural groove on its surface. The crinkled sidewalls of
          the dorsal lip flatten out as epiboly in the dorsal
          midline catches up to that in other areas of the
          blastoderm margin.
        
        
          Stage 14
          (Fig. 4E) - The yolk plug is 1/8 or less the equator
          diameter but is still visible. The embryonic shield is
          long, intruding anteriad on the evacuation zone, which
          has a jumble of floor cells. They can easily be dislodged
          with a hair loop. The shield extends over about 100° of
          the yolk cell surface. Although its neural groove has
          deepened somewhat, it is still quite shallow.
          The subgerminal cavity, distinct from the evacuation
          zone, begins to inflate under the embryonic shield, but
          little outside it. It has a smooth floor, which is formed
          by the surface of the 
          ysl. 
        
        
          Stage 15, yolk plug closure
          (Fig. 4F) - The yolk plug is no longer visible inside
          the tiny blastopore. The neural folds are distinct, but
          feeble. They close in a posterior-anterior sequence at
          this stage, remaining open last at their anterior end.
          Internally, the posterior part of the notochord
          segregates from the neural keel. A crescent of cells
          extends forward, anterior to the neural field. Later,
          these cells will contribute to the adhesive organ. The
          subgerminal cavity inflates lateral to the neural keel.
          This cavity is not a blastocoel; it is a product of
          morphogenetic cell movements, not of cleavage.
        
        
          Stage 16
          (Fig. 5A, 5B) - The embryo's axis occupies from 150°
          to 180° of the egg circumference. The neural folds
          disappear and the neural keel pushes deeper, intruding on
          the subgerminal cavity. The prospective diencephalon
          enlarges slightly where the optic lobes will form.
          The inflated subgerminal cavity extends the full
          length of the embryonic axis. The cavity extends
          laterally as a wide pellucid area on each side of the
          axis, and anterior to the brain, it extends into the
          evacuation zone. Somites 1-10 appear during this stage,
          and pronephric ducts occur from somite 4 posteriad. A
          slight swelling, the trunk-tail bud, lies at the
          posterior end.
        
        
          Stage 17
          (Fig. 5C) - New somites form, from the 10 thto the 20
          th. The length of the axis exceeds 180° of the egg
          circumference. Expansion of the optic vesicles is
          obvious; they enlarge to hemispherical proportions. The
          telencephalon lies anterior to them. Development of the
          adhesive organ produces a bean-shaped swelling anterior
          to the brain. Thickened protrusions in the subgerminal
          cavity roof, lateral to the axis, mark the beginning of
          the pharyngeal arches.
        
        
          Stage 18
          (Fig. 5D) - New somites form, from the 20 thto the 25
          th. The brain and trunk-tail bud rise prominently above
          the main curvature of the embryo, but neither is
          undercut. The single curved mass of the adhesive organ
          wraps tightly around the telencephalon. The optic
          swellings have become rounded vesicles.
          The hyomandibular and hyobranchial pharyngeal pouches
          are visible externally, but they are best seen from below
          after dissection of the embryo from the yolk. The walls
          of the pharynx, as seen in dissection, project down
          laterally and begin to fold mesad to form the pharynx
          floor.
        
        
          Stage 19
          (Fig. 5E) - New somites form, from the 25 thto the 30
          th. The trunk-tail bud projects from the embryo; it is
          slightly undercut, but not bent down around the yolk
          sac's contour. The head end is markedly raised and
          appears knobby because of the swollen brain vesicles, the
          spherical optic vesicles, and the adhesive organs. The
          operculum appears, extending a free edge. Ventral fusion
          of the pharynx sidewalls begins, signaling the appearance
          of the anterior intestinal portal. Lateral plate mesoderm
          extends about halfway out over the yolk sac. A vascular
          network shows on the dorsal portion of the yolk sac, but
          the heart is straight and not beating.
        
        
          Stage 20
          (Fig. 5F) - New somites form from 30 thto 40 th. The
          trunk-tail projection bends down in a curve that follows
          the yolk mass, and is undercut for a distance equal to
          that from adhesive organ to hindbrain. The posterior
          intestinal portal appears. The pronephros begins to bend.
          Lenses can be seen in the eyes. The opercular edge begins
          its extension. This is the stage of first motility, a
          slight one-sided squirm at best.
        
        
          Stage 21
          (Fig. 6A) - The trunk-tail outgrowth is now longer
          than the whole brain, but still curved along the contour
          of the yolk. Post-cloacal somites are now forming and the
          dorsal fin fold appears. The trunk is almost straight.
          The entire trunk is still attached to the yolk mass, but
          the cloacal region is beginning to lift away from it.
          There is a strong pronephric bend.
          The head begins to project freely over the mouth area.
          The adhesive organ is larger than the eyeball, but it is
          not sticky. The epiphysis appears and olfactory placodes
          are visible. One can find pigment on the yolk sac and
          posterodorsal to the eye. The heart begins to beat. It is
          hardly curved at all. Blood vessels cover all but the
          midventral part of the yolk. Motility increases, and
          embryos move in a strong, single coil.
        
        
          Stage 22
          (Fig. 6B) - The free portion of the trunk is fairly
          straight, but the tail is bent down beyond the cloaca,
          which is 1/2 to 2/3 of the way out along the free ventral
          surface of the trunk. The dorsal finfold is obvious and
          the intestine is visible between the yolk mass and the
          cloaca. Post-cloacal somites have formed halfway out
          along the tail.
          When viewed face on, the adhesive organ has the shape
          of a horseshoe. The heart begins to coil and blood flows
          on to the dorsal face of the yolk sac. Dissection reveals
          a bulging liver, although this is not visible externally.
          Trunk somites are arranged as chevrons halfway down the
          attached portion of the trunk. Motility increases to one
          or two coils, but there is no backlash.
        
        
          Stage 23
          (Fig. 6C) - The tail is finally straight. Both the
          dorsal and ventral fin folds of the tail are taller than
          the caudal somites and a ventral fin notch appears at the
          cloaca. Inside the chorion, the tail tip reaches the
          eye.
          The somites become dusted with pigment. Somites are
          chevron-shaped only on the attached part of the trunk.
          The margin of the operculum is thickened but does not yet
          flare. Blood circulation is established over most of the
          yolk mass and the flow is strong in the subintestinal
          vein.
        
        
          Stage 24
          (Fig. 6D) - Tail segmentation is virtually complete;
          it never reaches the tail tip. The yolk mass has become
          ovoid. The adhesive organ becomes sticky. The free edge
          of the operculum begins to expand, but does not yet cover
          the branchial arches. Dechorionated embryos can swim
          clumsily when prodded.
        
        
          Stage 25
          (Fig. 7A) - Somites are chevron-shaped as far as the
          middle of the trunk. Pectoral fin buds are visible after
          fixation. Specimens can swim in circles when prodded.
        
        
          Stage 26
          (Fig. 7B) - Pectoral fin buds are visible in the
          living embryo. Somites are chevron-shaped past the
          cloaca. There is a prominent bulge in the operculum edge
          below the branchial arches.
        
        
          Stage 27
          (Fig. 7C) - Pigment aggregates in the ventral fin
          fold, indicating the location of the future anal and
          caudal fins. Pectoral plates now possess barely
          detectable ridges. The adhesive organ is equal to or
          larger than the eye.
        
        
          Stage 28
          (Fig. 7D) - Anlagen of the anal and caudal fins are
          clearly visible in the ventral fin fold. Erosion of the
          dorsal fin fold begins, back beyond the pectoral fin
          level. The pectoral fin is now a low disc without a
          membranous flange. The opercular flap, which is as wide
          as the eye, obscures the branchial arches in side view.
          Slight swellings on the gill arches presage gill
          filaments.
        
        
          Stage 29
          (Fig. 8A, 8B) - The anlage of the dorsal fin is now
          visible in the dorsal fin fold. Although the pectoral fin
          has acquired the shape of a half-moon, it still has no
          flange. Gill filaments are sprouting on branchial arches
          one and two. Most hatching occurs at this stage.
        
        
          Stage 30
          (Figs. 8C, 10E) - The dorsal fin fold has eroded as
          far as the mid-trunk. The height of the yolk mass now has
          been reduced nearly to the height of the tail including
          its fin folds. The pectoral fin is larger than a
          half-moon, with a flange narrower than its muscle mass.
          The operculum is nearly twice as wide as the eye. Gill
          filaments occur on branchial arch three.
        
        
          Stage 31
          (Fig. 8D) - The dorsal fin fold has eroded beyond the
          mid-trunk; and the height of the yolk mass is now less
          than or equal to the height of the tail including its fin
          folds. Somites are chevron shaped clear to the caudal
          fin. The pectoral fin flange is now equal to or wider
          than the fin's muscular disc. The edge of the operculum
          flap reaches the base of the pectoral fin. The diameter
          of the adhesive organ is now less than that of the eye.
          The nasal pit is still single and round, as it has been
          since stage 27.
        
        
          Stage 32
          (Fig. 9A, 9B) - Pelvic fin mats are visible as smooth
          bulges. The yolk mass is still perhaps twice the volume
          of the head. Nasal openings are still single, but
          elongating; and the snout begins to lengthen. The lower
          jaw reaches the adhesive organ. Rhythmic movements of the
          jaw and operculum begin. Bump-like tooth primordia are
          barely visible on the jaws. The pectoral fins tremble at
          the end of a swim.
        
        
          Stage 33
          (Fig. 9C, 9D) - The fin fold of the tail is shrinking
          between the anal and caudal fins, and around the
          permanent dorsal fin. Rudiments of fin rays become
          visible in these unpaired fins. No dorsal fin fold
          remains anterior to the level of the cloaca. The yolk
          mass is now smaller than the head. The nasal apparatus
          finally has separated into incurrent and excurrent
          openings.
        
        
          Stage 34
          (Fig. 9E, 9F) - The yolk is finally exhausted. Pelvic
          fins are half-moon shaped with narrow membranous flanges.
          The jaws are studded with sharp teeth.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The bowfin, 
        Amia calva, and the garpike, 
        Lepisosteus osseus, are frequently
        compared to each other in their anatomical characters, as
        they are both basal actinopterygians. Study of their
        development is an appropriate sequel to previous work on
        members of the Chondrostei - the paddlefish, 
        Polyodon [ 12] and the sturgeons. 
        Huso and 
        Acipenser [ 13].
        Garpike have three developmental characters that
        immediately separate them from bowfin: 1) they show
        meroblastic cleavage, 2) they possess a well-defined yolk
        syncytial layer, and 3) events of gastrulation produce a
        pit associated with the dorsal blastoderm margin. The pit
        is a formation of maneuver, a temporary structure resulting
        from cell migration. It has no apparent ultimate
        morphogenetic significance, and it eventually
        disappears.
        
        Amia cleavage is clearly holoblastic,
        producing about a dozen large yolky macromeres, upon which
        the smaller cells of the blastoderm rest [ 14]. An initial
        view of 
        Lepisosteus would lead one to draw a
        similar conclusion for this fish. However, only one or two
        garpike cleavage furrows even extend to the vegetal pole,
        and these are nothing more than shallow grooves in the yolk
        cell cortex. They eventually regress. Garpike, therefore,
        have a single yolk cell similar to that of teleosts. This
        condition sets the stage for the later appearance of the
        yolk syncytial layer 
        (ysl), an otherwise uniquely
        teleostean feature. From a phylogenetic point of view, the
        garpike 
        ysl marks its first evolutionary
        appearance in the actinopterygian fishes. The teleost 
        ysl has important mechanical and
        communications functions in early development [ 19, 20,
        21]. Therefore, its presence in 
        Lepisosteus raises interesting
        questions about its role there. One of us (Long) is
        pursuing these.
        Among the ray-finned fishes, bichirs, sturgeon and
        paddlefish display a dorsal lip around which surface cells
        migrate to the interior [ 12, 13, 16, 17]. Others, e.g. [
        22, 23], reported a similar condition in bowfin, a
        circumstance later shown to be mistaken [ 14, 15]. Teleost
        fishes lack both a blastopore and invagination; their outer
        enveloping layer of cells serves as a casing inside of
        which deep cells construct the embryo [ 24]. The appearance
        in garpike of structures appearing similar to the
        sturgeon's dorsal lip raises the possibility that
        invagination and involution of surface cells to the
        interior actually happens in 
        Lepisosteus. Cell marking experiments
        actually show that to be the case (Long, unpublished), thus
        we use the terms 
        dorsal lip, blastopore, and 
        yolk plug as names for the
        appropriate embryonic structures in this report.
        Their size, feeding habits, and seasonal spawning cycle
        make 
        Lepisosteus embryos generally
        unsuitable for rapid progress through experiments, as is
        possible for organisms like the zebrafish, 
        Danio rerio. Garpike embryos,
        however, possess combinations of features whose
        investigation should prove valuable in the areas of
        development, evolution and taxonomy. We hope that this
        catalogue and description of the developmental sequence in
        the garpike, and our notations of comparison to other
        fishes, will spur further investigation into the embryology
        of these remarkable animals.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        Longnose gar spawn during the months of May and June in
        Michigan and Vermont, the locations at which we collected
        our specimens. The first two weeks of June were productive
        at the Michigan site. Dean [ 6] took eggs from a lake in
        New York State between May 14 thand June 12 th.
        One of us (Ballard) collected some specimens for this
        study from a rocky shoreline in Vermont, on the eastern
        side of Lake Champlain, opposite Fort Ticonderoga. He took
        them from the rocks on which they were laid as soon as
        possible after natural spawning of the fish, which were
        abundant in the lake during those years (1949-1963). These
        eggs developed in dishes of standing water on a water table
        at Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire.
        Later, from 1981 onward, we worked at the Gull Lake
        Laboratories of Michigan State University, near Hickory
        Corners, MI. Laboratory facilities are immediately adjacent
        to the lake, and only a hundred feet from the site at which
        we trapped garpike in spawning condition. We first used a
        gill net set overnight perpendicular to the shoreline,
        running from the shore to about a hundred feet into the
        lake. Later, we used a trap net set in a similar manner.
        Both of the devices were used under supervision of the
        Michigan State Department of Natural Resources, and the
        department owned the trap net. Adults providing gametes
        ranged from 75 cm to 104 cm in length; the females tended
        to be larger than the males. Adult females possessed a
        silvery body coloration, while males had a golden cast to
        their scales.
        We dissected ripe gametes from the ovaries of gravid
        females and fertilized them in glass dishes by mixing them
        with minced testes, a procedure similar to that commonly
        used to fertilize frog eggs in the lab [ 25]. We rinsed the
        zygotes and incubated them in running water, pumped fresh
        from the lake. The first oöcytes to mature during the
        spawning season are located in the anterior end of the
        ovary. Oöcytes mature in a wave proceeding gradually
        posteriad as the season progresses. The ovaries are large
        and contain thousands of eggs. The eggs turn from white to
        gray as they mature.
        Specimens from the 1949-1963 batches were preserved in
        Bouin's fluid at appropriate stages. A glutaraldehyde
        fixative (3% glutaraldehyde in 50% Holtfreter solution)
        served for the more recent work. One day in the
        glutaraldehyde, followed by an overnight rinse in cold (4°)
        50% Holtfreter solution, prepared the specimens for
        transfer to 35% ethanol, and then to 70% ethanol for
        storage. We generally dechorionated the specimens after the
        Bouin's or glutaraldehyde fixation, i. e. during the first
        rinse. Some embryos were dechorionated with pronase, 2
        mg/ml, before fixation.
        Paraffin sections provided an internal view of specimens
        at various stages. Ballard also prepared some
        celloidin-imbedded hand sections more than thirty-five
        years ago; figure 3Cwas drawn from one of these. Some
        material was also prepared for scanning electron
        microscopy, and examined using the ETEC Autoscan scope at
        Western Maryland College. In this case, specimens were
        carried gradually through a series of 70% ethanol, 95%
        ethanol, a 50:50 mix of acetone and 95% ethanol, to
        acetone. They were processed through a critical point dryer
        and sputter coated with gold before observation.
        Alternately, specimens for electron microscopy were passed
        through a series of 95% ethanol, 97.5% ethanol, absolute
        ethanol, a 50:50 mix of absolute ethanol and
        hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), to 100% HMDS. These were
        allowed to air dry in a fume hood before mounting and
        sputter coating. The specimen shown in figure 10Dwas
        prepared this way. Usually, we dissected fresh or
        recently-fixed embryos to look into their interior.
        Dissection easily provided the level of detail required for
        definitions of these stages, and the other methods
        confirmed the identification of internal structures.
        Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9were prepared from camera
        lucida drawings made over the years. The design of the
        stages and the use of outline drawings follow the pattern
        established by Ballard and his associates for the normal
        stages of fishes [ 12, 14, 26, 27, 28, 29]. Figure 10shows
        photomicrographs of selected live specimens, and an example
        of one specimen prepared for electron microscopy.
