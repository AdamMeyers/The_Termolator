        Metastasis of tumor cells is critically dependent on the
        ability of cancer cells to adhere and migrate. The cell
        surface expressed integrins can control this process by
        physically interacting with the extracellular matrix
        proteins and other cell surface proteins on endothelial
        cells lining the blood vessel wall [ 1 ] . These integrins
        signal adhesion and migration by communicating with several
        tyrosine kinases inside the cell, including the Focal
        Adhesion Kinase (FAK) and Src family kinases [ 1 2 ] . Src
        kinases control the activation of FAK, as well as the
        tyrosine phosphorylation of critical substrates that
        regulate adhesion and migration [ 3 ] . Indeed, colon
        cancer cells with high metastatic potential have elevated
        levels of Src activity or activating mutations in the Src
        gene [ 4 5 ] . One Src substrate that is involved in
        regulating an important signaling node in this process is
        the adaptor protein p130 
        cas (Cas) [ 6 7 8 9 10 ] . Cas
        appears to play a central role in the transformation
        process by several oncogenes including ras, ornithine
        decarboxylase (ODC), v-Src, v-crk, and Bcr-Abl, as these
        tumors all have elevated levels of tyrosine phosphorylated
        Cas [ 6 11 12 13 ] . Cells from mice that lack Cas have
        much reduced migration and are resistant to transformation
        by v-Src, while expression of Cas anti-sense RNA in cells
        transformed with ras, v-Src or ODC result in reversion of
        the transformed phenotype [ 11 14 15 ] . Furthermore,
        increased expression of Cas can rescue cell migration and
        adhesion in cells expressing the tumor suppressor PTEN, and
        can enhance cell migration and adhesion in normal cells,
        with a major role being played by the substrate domain [ 16
        17 ] .
        Cas is a protein which migrates with an apparent mass of
        approximately 130 kDa, with a N-terminal SH3 domain, a
        central substrate domain (SD) with up to 15 tyrosines which
        can be phosphorylated, a C-terminal region with a
        proline-rich region, and two tyrosine phosphorylation sites
        capable of binding Src kinases (Src binding domain (SBD)) [
        6 18 ] . The latter SBD domain regulates the ability of Src
        to activate the serum response element, as well as in the
        phosphorylation of the SD of Cas by Src [ 18 19 20 ] . The
        substrate domain controls adhesion and migration and the
        majority of the tyrosines within this domain are of the
        sequence YQXP (5) or YDXP (10), which when phosphorylated,
        bind to the adaptors c-crk, nck and AND-34 [ 16 21 22 23 ]
        . The importance of these molecules in Cas function is
        unclear, however c-crk seems to be critical in the
        regulation of adhesion and migration mediated by Cas. In
        addition, the SH3 domain of Cas mediates an interaction
        with FAK, C3G, CMS, and the zinc finger containing protein
        CIZ, while nephrocystin interacts with Cas via its SH3
        domain and proline rich sequences in Cas [ 24 25 26 27 28
        29 30 ] . The SH3 domain of Cas can also interact with the
        tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, and expression of PTP1B in
        transformed cells reverts the phenotype, in part by
        dephosphorylating Cas [ 31 32 ] .
        Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is regulated by
        adhesion, such that adherent and migrating cells have high
        levels of tyrosine phosphorylated Cas, whereas cells in
        suspension have reduced levels of Cas phosphorylation [ 10
        33 ] . In addition, as mentioned above, transformed cells
        that are able to grow in an anchorage independent manner
        show increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas [ 10 33 ] .
        These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas in
        part regulates a switch from adhesion dependent growth to
        adhesion independent growth. Whether mere tyrosine
        phosphorylation or localization of Cas is more important
        for its regulation of adhesion and migration is unclear.
        Tyrosine phosphorylation of adaptor molecules such as Cas
        is dependent on upstream signals that lead to the
        phosphorylation of the adaptor, and with multiple pathways
        leading from these upstream signals it is difficult to
        tease out the events resulting from the phosphorylated
        adaptor itself. We have tried to address this problem by
        constructing a chimeric Cas molecule (Src*/Cas(SD)) that is
        phosphorylated independently of upstream signals by fusing
        the SD of Cas to a Src kinase domain that had been
        attenuated by mutating the activation tyrosine (Y 416) to
        phenylalanine. Such a mutant is inactive against exogenous
        substrates [ 34 35 36 ] . We found that this Src*/Cas(SD)
        molecule is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated when
        expressed either transiently or stably in cells, and acts
        as a dominant negative mutant, attenuating v-crk mediated
        transformation when expressed in cells transformed by this
        oncogene. We also observed a reduction in basal JNK
        activity in normal cells expressing this chimera and in
        v-crk mediated activation of JNK in cell expressing both
        v-crk and the chimera. By contrast, tyrosine
        phosphorylation of endogenous Cas and FAK was unaffected by
        the Cas chimera, indicating that these processes lie
        upstream of the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD. Finally, we
        show that this chimera can act as a decoy to selectively
        disrupt signaling events downstream of the tyrosine
        phosphorylated SD of endogenous Cas, acting as a dominant
        negative mutant. We suggest that this approach and modified
        versions of this approach can be a general method to
        determine the role of tyrosine phosphorylated domains
        without regard to upstream signals.
      
      
        Results
        
          Creation of a dominantly tyrosine phosphorylated
          Cas substrate domain
          The adaptor protein Cas has a N-terminal SH3 domain, a
          large number of tyrosines that serve as potential kinase
          substrates within its substrate domain and a C-terminal
          Src binding domain (Fig. 1). Understanding the function
          of this substrate domain and the tyrosines within it
          could lead to a better understanding of the signaling
          pathways regulated by this protein. Previously,
          investigators have created dominant negative versions of
          this protein lacking its substrate domain and shown that
          it is required for cell adhesion and migration. However,
          these studies depend on upstream signals and so it is not
          clear which signals are directly emanating from the
          substrate domain itself, as this domain requires the
          activation of upstream kinases for its phosphorylation
          and function. We have tried to address this problem by
          attempting to create a dominant active substrate domain
          of Cas, i.e. a Cas substrate domain that is
          constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and able to send
          signals independently of upstream signals. We did this by
          fusing the SD of Cas to a Src kinase domain that had been
          attenuated by mutating the activation tyrosine (Y 416) to
          phenylalanine (Src*/Cas(SD), Fig. 2). This Src mutant is
          inactive against exogenous substrates [ 34 35 36 ] . We
          also generated fusions of the Cas SD with a Src kinase
          inactive mutant (K295M) that has no enzymatic activity
          (Src KM/Cas(SD)), fusions of either the attenuated kinase
          domain or kinase inactive domain to the 5' or 3' regions
          of the Cas SD (Src*/Cas(5'SD), Src*/Cas(3'SD), Src
          KM/Cas(5'SD), Src KM/Cas(3'SD)), as well as the
          attenuated Src kinase (Src*) alone without the attached
          Cas SD (Fig. 2). Transient expression of the Src*/Cas(SD)
          in Cos-7 cells followed by analysis of total cell lysates
          using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies demonstrated that
          while the attenuated Src kinase domain alone did not
          increase total cellular tyrosine phosphorylated proteins
          as expected, expression of the Src*/Cas(SD) fusion
          resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of the
          expected size of the chimera, as well as other proteins
          (Fig. 3a, 3b). Expression of the Cas(SD) or the Src
          KM/Cas(SD), fusion did not result in any increase in
          total phosphotyrosine containing proteins nor in the
          tyrosine phosphorylation of the Cas SD (data not shown
          and see Fig. 4).
        
        
          The C-terminus of the Cas SD is involved in the
          interaction with v-crk
          Investigators have shown that v-crk interacts via its
          SH2 domain with the substrate domain of Cas [ 6 ] .
          Association of v-crk with endogenous Cas is believed to
          protect the phosphorylation status of this molecule due
          to protection from phosphatases [ 12 ] . Expression of an
          unphosphorylated Cas SD along with v-crk should therefore
          result in stable tyrosine phosphorylation of the Cas SD
          if they interact. The Cas SD has two sets of potential
          SH2 interacting tyrosines, the N-terminal subdomain
          containing 4 YQXP motifs located between a.a. L 157to A
          324and the C-terminal subdomain containing, 9 YDXP motifs
          located between a.a. S 325to R 516. The v-crk SH2 domain
          interacts with YXXP motifs upon phosphorylation,
          suggesting that both of these regions may be able to
          interact with v-crk [ 37 ] . Fusions of the kinase
          inactive Src kinase domain and either the full Cas SD,
          the 5' region of the Cas SD (Cas(5'SD), containing 4 YQXP
          motifs) or the 3' of the Cas SD (Cas(3'SD), containing 9
          YDXP motifs), are not stably tyrosine phosphorylated when
          expressed alone in cells (data not shown and see Fig.
          4b). We therefore used these fusions to determine which
          region of the Cas SD interacts with v-crk. Initially, we
          expressed the Src KM/Cas(SD) (entire Cas SD) in Cos-7
          cells alone, or along with wild type (WT) v-crk, or v-crk
          SH2 or SH3 mutants and assayed for tyrosine
          phosphorylation and association by co-immunoprecipitation
          (Fig. 4a). Figure 4ademonstrates that while the chimera
          was not stably tyrosine phosphorylated when expressed
          alone, expression of the Src KM/Cas(SD) chimera along
          with either WT or an SH3 domain mutant of v-crk resulted
          in its stable tyrosine phosphorylation and
          co-immunoprecipitation with v-crk (Fig. 4a, lanes 2 &
          4). However, co-expression of the Src KM/Cas(SD) chimera
          along with a SH2 mutant of v-crk demonstrated that an
          intact v-crk SH2 domain is required for association with
          the tyrosine phosphorylated Src KM/Cas(SD) (Fig. 4a, lane
          3). These data suggest that the kinase inactive fusion
          with the Cas SD is either transiently tyrosine
          phosphorylated in cells and v-crk protects them from
          being dephosphorylated by interacting with them via its
          SH2 domain, or alternatively, that v-crk induces their
          tyrosine phosphorylation.
          We then used the 5' and 3' fusions of the Cas SD to
          determine which motif, YQXP or YDXP, interacts with the
          v-crk SH2 domain. Expression of the Src KMfused to the
          full length Cas SD, 5' N-terminal YQXP motifs or 3'
          C-terminal YDXP motifs alone demonstrated that these
          fusions were not stably tyrosine phosphorylated in cells
          (Fig. 4b, lanes 1-3), although they can be stably
          tyrosine phosphorylated when fused to the attenuated Src
          kinase domain (data not shown and see Fig. 7a). By
          contrast, co-expression of these fusions along with v-crk
          results in stable tyrosine phosphorylation of the 3'
          C-terminal YDXP motifs and the full length Cas SD
          (carrying both motifs), but not the 5' N-terminal YQXP
          motifs (Fig. 4b, lanes 4-6). These data indicate that the
          v-crk SH2 domain interacts with the C-terminal YDXP
          motifs, and as suggested by Birge et al, v-crk may be
          able to protect them from dephosphorylation and/or
          induces their phosphorylation [ 12 ] . They also suggest
          that the YQXP motifs may be involved in binding to other
          intracellular signaling molecules.
        
        
          Suppression of v-crk mediated transformation by
          tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD
          As our tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD chimera can
          interact with v-crk, we decided to find out if the
          chimera would affect cell growth and/or transformation in
          normal cells and those transformed with v-crk. NIH3T3
          cells or those transformed with v-crk were stably
          transfected with the Cas SD chimera (Fig. 5). Several
          independent clones were obtained for each set of
          transfections suggesting that expression of the tyrosine
          phosphorylated Cas SD domain did not negatively affect
          cell growth (data not shown). Figure 5ademonstrates that
          stable expression of the Src*/Cas(SD) chimera resulted in
          constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein in
          NIH3T3 cells. Analysis of the effect of this chimera in
          non-transformed NIH3T3 cells indicates that these cells
          were not transformed and had normal morphology, although
          they grew slightly slower than vector-transfected cells
          (data not shown). Analysis of the growth of either
          non-transformed or v-crk transformed NIH3T3 cells in soft
          agar confirmed that expression of tyrosine phosphorylated
          Cas SD chimera did not transform NIH3T3 cells as no
          colonies of these cells grew in soft agar (data not
          shown). Instead, expression of tyrosine phosphorylated
          Cas SD chimera resulted in significant reduction in the
          number of v-crk/NIH3T3 soft agar colonies as well as
          their size (Fig. 5b), suggesting that the Src*/Cas(SD)
          chimera blocked the ability of v-crk to transform these
          cells.
        
        
          Tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD blocks JNK
          activation by v-crk
          The JNK pathway is regulated by interaction of c- or
          v-crk with Cas via the substrate domain [ 38 ] . In
          determining which pathways are affected in our stable
          cell lines generated, we determined if JNK was activated
          in the v-crk transformed cells, and if the tyrosine
          phosphorylated Cas chimera was affecting this activation.
          JNK was immunoprecipitated and tested for activity from
          control NIH3T3 cells, those expressing the Cas chimera
          and those expressing the Cas chimera and v-crk (Fig. 6a).
          We found that while JNK activity was elevated in v-crk
          transformed NIH3T3 cells, expression of the tyrosine
          phosphorylated Cas chimera resulted in reduced activity
          of JNK (Fig. 6a, cf. lanes 1, 5 and 7). Interestingly,
          JNK activity was also lower in the NIH3T3 cells
          expressing the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas chimera than
          the vector transfected cells, suggesting that this
          chimera also affected JNK activity in those cells (Fig.
          6a, cf. lanes 1 and 4). These data suggest that the
          tyrosine phosphorylated Cas chimera perturbs signaling
          via v-crk and probably via endogenous c-crk to affect the
          activation of the JNK pathway.
          We also verified that the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas
          chimera could affect the ability of v-crk to activate the
          JNK pathway in transient transfection experiments (Fig.
          6b). Transfection of v-crk along with gst-JNK into Cos-7
          cells resulted in activation of the co-transfected JNK
          (Fig. 6b, cf. lanes 1 and 2). However, co-transfection of
          v-crk and gst-JNK with the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas
          chimera blocked the activation of JNK induced by v-crk
          (Fig. 6b, cf. lanes 2 & 3), confirming that tyrosine
          phosphorylated Cas SD can inhibit the ability of v-crk to
          activate the JNK pathway. Transient expression of the
          Src* increased JNK activity slightly while expression of
          the Src KM/Cas(SD) fusion did not affect JNK activity
          (data not shown).
          To determine if the tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas SD
          chimera affected other signaling pathways, we tested
          whether the association between c-crk and C3G was
          affected in NIH3T3 cells expressing the chimera (Fig.
          7a). Immunoprecipitating endogenous c-crk and probing for
          associated C3G demonstrated that C3G association with
          c-crk was reduced in the presence of the tyrosine
          phosphorylated chimera (Fig. 7a, cf. lanes 3, 4 & 5).
          In addition, we determined if tyrosine phosphorylation of
          endogenous FAK and endogenous Cas was affected by the
          presence of the chimera. This was not the case. Figure
          7bdemonstrates that there was no difference in tyrosine
          phosphorylation or association with tyrosine
          phosphorylated proteins of either FAK or endogenous Cas
          upon stable expression of the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas
          SD chimera.
        
        
          Tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD acts as a decoy for
          v-crk and endogenous c-crk
          As the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas substrate domain
          acts as a dominant negative for v-crk mediated
          transformation and JNK activation, and can also interact
          with v-crk and c-crk (data not shown), we wanted to
          determine if it could compete for binding of v- and c-crk
          to endogenous Cas. We transfected v-crk alone or along
          with the chimera of the attenuated Src kinase domain
          fused to the C-terminal crk interacting region of the Cas
          substrate domain (Src*/Cas(3'SD), carrying the YDXP
          motifs) into Cos-7 cells and immunoprecipitated either
          the chimera or v-crk and assayed for interacting tyrosine
          phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 8a). Our analysis showed
          that expression of this chimera resulted in expression of
          the highly tyrosine phosphorylated Cas 3'SD chimera (Fig.
          8a, lanes 2 (whole cell lysates) or lane 3, anti-chimera
          immunoprecipitate). Expression of v-crk alone resulted in
          its co-immunoprecipitation with endogenous tyrosine
          phosphorylated Cas (Fig. 8a, lane 4). By contrast,
          co-expression of v-crk with the chimera resulted in
          reduction in the association of v-crk with endogenous Cas
          and in induced association of v-crk with the tyrosine
          phosphorylated Cas 3'SD (Fig. 8a, lane 5). To determine
          if the tyrosine phosphorylated chimera could compete with
          endogenous Cas for binding to endogenous c-crk, we
          transfected either the isolated attenuated Src kinase
          domain as control, or the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas
          substrate domain (Src*/Cas(SD)) into Cos-7 cells, and
          immunoprecipitated endogenous c-crk (Fig. 8b).
          Immunoprecipitation of endogenous c-crk showed
          association with endogenous Cas (Fig. 8b, lane 1), while
          co-expression of the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas
          substrate domain resulted in reduced association of
          endogenous c-crk with endogenous Cas and association with
          the tyrosine phosphorylated chimera (Fig. 8b, lane 2).
          These data suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylated
          substrate domain of Cas acts as a decoy for binding to v-
          and c-crk thereby interfering with signaling to JNK
          activation and transformation.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Adaptor proteins that regulate tyrosine kinase signaling
        pathways fall into two major categories, those primarily
        with protein/protein interaction domains such as SH2, SH3,
        PTB, and PH domains, exemplified by the adaptor proteins
        c-crk, nck and grb-2, and those that are primarily tyrosine
        phosphorylated, exemplified by proteins such as Cas, Dok,
        IRS-1 and 2, Slp-76, LAT, TRIM or SIT. The latter class may
        also have protein/protein interaction domains. The former
        class of adaptor proteins form complexes with downstream
        effectors in a constitutive fashion via their SH3 domains.
        Signals are initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of
        upstream effectors that recruit these adaptors to assemble
        larger protein complexes by bringing downstream effectors
        to the distinct cellular compartments for activation. Thus
        c-crk interacts constitutively with downstream effectors
        such as C3G via its SH3 domains, and interacts in a
        phosphotyrosine dependent fashion with tyrosine
        phosphorylated receptors using its SH2 domain [ 39 ] . To
        analyze downstream signals regulated by these adaptor
        proteins, investigators have developed methods that target
        them to distinct cellular membrane compartments by using
        heterologous targeting sequences. This leads to the
        generation of constitutive signals by the adaptor proteins
        in the absence of other upstream signals [ 40 ] .
        The second class of phosphotyrosine dependent adaptors
        exemplified by proteins such as Cas, Dok, IRS-1 and 2 or
        Slp-76, as cytosolic adaptors, or LAT, TRIM or SIT as
        membrane anchored adaptors, also require the activation of
        upstream signals by tyrosine kinases for their function.
        This second class of adaptor proteins is characterized by a
        substrate domain with multiple tyrosines for
        phosphorylation by upstream kinases. Phosphorylation of
        these sites leads to recruitment of other proteins,
        including the first class of adaptor proteins with SH2 or
        PTB domains, and subsequent signal transmission (see [ 41 ]
        for review). Analysis of the specific signals emanating
        from the second class of adaptor proteins has been
        difficult due to their dependence on upstream kinases for
        tyrosine phosphorylation of the substrate domains for
        subsequent assembly of downstream effectors. While these
        upstream kinases lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of the
        adaptor and activation of downstream effectors, they
        usually also activate other signaling pathways that can
        confound analysis of the specific role of the tyrosine
        phosphorylated adaptor protein.
        We describe a novel chimeric molecule approach that
        allows the analysis of signaling events regulated by
        adaptor proteins that require tyrosine phosphorylation by
        upstream signals for which we used the Cas protein as a
        model. The adaptor protein Cas has several domains that are
        important for its function, an SH3 domain, a central
        substrate domain with up to 15 tyrosines that can serve as
        tyrosine kinase substrates for upstream kinases such as Src
        and Abl [ 19 42 43 ] , and a C-terminal Src binding domain
        with PXXP motifs for binding to the SH3 domain of Src, and
        two tyrosines providing docking sites for the Src SH2
        domain upon phosphorylation [ 6 ] . The substrate domain of
        Cas has two major types of tyrosine motifs that can be
        phosphorylated and bind downstream effectors, YQXP (4
        copies) and YDXP motifs (9 copies), suggesting that at
        least two classes of downstream effectors, one capable of
        binding to YDXP motifs and the other capable of binding to
        YQXP motifs, are assembled by this adaptor protein.
        Tyrosine phosphorylation of the substrate domain leads to
        the recruitment of other downstream adaptors such as crk
        and nck, as well as other downstream effectors possessing
        SH2 domains, and signaling events attributed to this domain
        include activation of the JNK MAPK pathway and control of
        adhesion and migration of cells [ 6 10 16 38 44 ] . We
        constructed a chimera between a kinase that phosphorylates
        Cas 
        in vivo and the substrate domain of
        Cas, in order to determine events regulated by this domain.
        We constructed chimeras by placing the Cas SD at either the
        N-terminus or C-terminus of the Src kinase domain. However,
        we found that placing the Cas SD at the N-terminus of the
        Src kinase domain was inferior to placing it at the
        C-terminus with regards to tyrosine phosphorylation of the
        Cas SD. Subsequently, in all our experiments reported, we
        used chimeras of the Cas SD fused to the C-terminus of the
        Src kinase domains. Rather than the WT kinase domain of
        Src, we used an attenuated Src kinase domain (Y416F) as the
        fusion partner for our chimera to avoid phosphorylation and
        activation of other Src substrates that would occur with a
        WT kinase domain (data not shown, [ 35 ] ). The attenuated
        Src kinase domain has reduced kinase activity and does not
        phosphorylate exogenous substrates [ 35 ] . We also used a
        kinase inactive Src kinase domain as a control fusion
        protein. The chimera of the Cas SD domain fused to the
        attenuated Src kinase domain was highly tyrosine
        phosphorylated in cells, and could bind known Cas binding
        proteins in cells. In contrast, the chimera containing the
        kinase inactive domain was not stably phosphorylated in
        cells. These findings indicated that this approach would be
        useful in analyzing the events that occur following
        tyrosine phosphorylation of the Cas SD in the absence of
        upstream signals that may activate other signaling
        pathways. Our initial experiments were designed to
        determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of the SD of Cas
        would lead to the assembly of protein complexes and
        activation of downstream effectors.
        Using different regions of the Cas SD containing either
        the YDXP or the YQXP motifs, we could demonstrate that
        v-crk specifically interacts with the C-terminal YDXP
        motifs when tyrosine phosphorylated. Moreover, in the
        absence of stable tyrosine phosphorylation as seen in the
        Src kinase inactive fusions, v-crk could either induce
        their phosphorylation, or protect transiently
        phosphorylated YDXP motifs from dephosphorylation through
        yet unknown mechanisms. Thus while both sets of motifs in
        the Cas SD have been thought to interact with the v-crk SH2
        domain, we demonstrated that this domain only interacts
        with the YDXP motifs. Since crk is the major protein
        reported to bind to the Cas SD, our data suggest that the
        YQXP motifs may interact with other yet to be identified
        downstream effectors.
        We also found that while downstream effectors assemble
        onto the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD domain, the
        downstream signals were not activated. In particular, we
        found that the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD domain
        blocked v-crk mediated activation of the JNK pathway. In
        addition, we found that expression of the tyrosine
        phosphorylated Cas SD domain in v-crk transformed cells
        reduced their ability to grow in soft agar, a measure of
        their transformation. Furthermore, we found that the
        tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD competed effectively with
        the endogenous Cas for binding to v-crk and endogenous
        c-crk, while not affecting tyrosine phosphorylation of
        proposed upstream proteins such as Fak and endogenous Cas.
        Thus, our data suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas
        SD acts as a decoy for endogenous Cas binding proteins and
        blocks signaling via crk to the activation of JNK, as well
        as transformation of cells by the oncogene v-crk. The
        ability of the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD to act as a
        decoy suggests that while tyrosine phosphorylation of the
        substrate domain of Cas may be important for its function
        in assembling downstream signals, specific localization of
        Cas may also be critical for its downstream functions.
        Indeed, phosphorylated endogenous Cas is localized to FAK
        and the focal adhesions via its SH3 domain and/or its Src
        binding domain in its distal C-terminus, both were excluded
        from our chimera, suggesting that proper localization of
        the tyrosine phosphorylated substrate domain may be
        required for Cas activity [ 30 45 ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        A number of proteins have been identified that bind to
        the substrate domain of Cas, however the large number of
        tyrosines and potential binding sites for downstream
        effectors suggest that there may be more. We propose that
        our chimeric approach can be used to identify Cas binding
        proteins in mammalian cells in the absence of specific
        upstream signals normally required for tyrosine
        phosphorylation of the Cas substrate domain. We can also
        use this approach to ask which tyrosines within the SD of
        Cas can act as decoys for specific downstream signals
        attributed to the SD of Cas. Other uses for such a chimera
        include screening approaches such as the yeast two-hybrid
        screen to select proteins that interact with the tyrosine
        phosphorylated Cas SD. Finally, we can theoretically target
        this tyrosine phosphorylated chimera to specific areas of
        the cell to determine which cellular localization will
        recover the activation of downstream Cas functions. This
        chimeric approach can also be extended to other adaptor
        proteins that require upstream signals for tyrosine
        phosphorylation, creating tyrosine phosphorylated decoys or
        targeting tyrosine phosphorylated substrate domains or full
        length adaptor proteins in transgenic cellular and animal
        systems. We also propose that similar approaches could be
        used for analyzing proteins that are phosphorylated on
        serine or threonine and assemble complexes, such as 14-3-3,
        for analysis of their downstream signals or identification
        of binding proteins.

          Cloning and chimera construction
          The kinase domains of the c-Src Y416F mutant (kind
          gift of Dr. Joan Brugge, Harvard Medical School, Boston,
          MA) or the kinase inactive c-Src (K295M, [ 46 ] ), were
          amplified by PCR and cloned in pJ3H and pJ3M, two vectors
          for HA- and Myc-tagging at the N-terminus of the protein
          (kind gifts from Dr. J. Chernoff, Fox Chase Cancer
          Center, Philadelphia, PA, [ 47 ] ). The pEBG-JNK was a
          kind gift of Dr. Bruce Mayer (Harvard Medical School,
          Boston, MA). The substrate domain of Cas (Fig. 1, a.a. L
          157to R 516) was amplified by PCR and fused in frame to
          the C-terminus of the attenuated SrcY416F kinase domain
          (Src*), or to the C-terminus of the inactive SrcK295M
          kinase domain (Src KM). Subfragments of the Cas substrate
          domain were generated in the same fashion, with the
          N-terminal subdomain (a.a. L 157to A 324, 1 YKVP motif
          and 4 YQXP motifs) and the C-terminal subdomain (a.a. S
          325to R 516, 9 YDXP motifs) of Cas amplified. Experiments
          used the chimeras expressed either via the pJ3H vector,
          or the HA-tagged chimera subcloned into the expression
          vector pMEXneo [ 48 ] . The oncogene v-crk and its
