        The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) form a subfamily
        of the Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β) superfamily [ 1
        2 3 4 ] . Members of the BMP family were initially
        identified by their ability to induce ectopic bone
        formation [ 4 ] . Functional characterization of BMPs and
        the cloning of new BMP family members have revealed that
        BMPs not only regulate bone formation and homeostasis but
        also function as morphogenetic factors for many other
        tissues and organs [ 2 ] . The critical regulatory roles of
        BMPs during early embryogenesis, such as neurogenesis,
        mesoderm formation and patterning, are also well-recognized
        [ 1 2 3 ] .
        Like other members of the TGF-β superfamily, BMPs induce
        intracellular signaling via heteromeric complexes of the
        type I and type II serine-threonine kinase receptors [ 5 6
        ] . The Smad family proteins are now known to function as
        key signal transducers downstream of the TGF-β family type
        I receptors [ 6 7 8 ] . The activated BMP type I receptors
        directly recruit and phosphorylate a set of cytoplasmic
        Smad proteins that are specific for the BMP type I
        receptors. Three such BMP type I receptor-regulated Smads,
        Smad1, 5 and 8, have been identified [ 9 ] . Among them,
        Smad1 has been studied most extensively. The
        phosphorylation of Smad1 at the carboxylterminal SSVS motif
        triggers the release of Smad1 from the receptor, the
        formation of homo-oligomers of Smad1 and hetero-oligomers
        of Smad1 and Smad4, and the subsequent nuclear
        translocation of both Smad1 and Smad4 [ 6 9 10 ] . In the
        nucleus, Smad1 and Smad4 function as DNA-binding
        transcriptional regulators [ 9 ] . However, there is a
        unique feature in Smad-regulated transcription. Instead of
        independently binding to specific DNA sequence to regulate
        transcription, Smads are now considered to be
        transcriptional modulators since their ability to regulate
        transcription is dependent, in most cases, on their
        physical interaction with other nearby DNA-binding
        transcription factors [ 11 ] . Thus, one of the fundamental
        questions in understanding Smad-regulated transcription is
        how Smads function as transcription modulators.
        The transcriptional regulatory activities of Smad1 in
        the nucleus are associated with its ability to directly
        bind to DNA [ 12 ] , its interaction with other DNA-binding
        transcription factors, such as OAZ, SIP1 and Hoxc-8 [ 13 14
        15 ] , and also its interaction with the master
        transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300 [ 16 ] . Smad4 is an
        essential functional partner in Smad-regulated
        transcription and also interacts with CBP/p300 via a domain
        within the central linker region named as SAD (Smad
        Activation Domain) [ 13 ] . Since CBP/p300 has intrinsic
        histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and participates
        in chromatin remodeling, the recruitment of CBP/p300 into
        the DNA-binding complexes of Smad1 and Smad4 is likely a
        critical step in Smad-regulated gene activation. However,
        our current knowledge of the molecular events involved in
        the recruitment of CBP/p300 and other transcriptional
        co-activators or co-repressors by Smads is still very
        limited. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms underlying
        the cooperative functional partnership between Smad1 and
        Smad4 during transcriptional regulation is not yet
        understood.
        Protein-protein interaction plays key roles in signal
        transduction. To gain further understanding of the
        signaling mechanisms of Smad1, we carried out a "blind"
        search for proteins that bind specifically to Smad1 using
        the yeast two-hybrid system. Characterization of these
        interactors reveals an unexpected physical and functional
        link between Smad1 and the proteasome-mediated degradation
        pathways. The 26S proteasome is responsible for the bulk
        turnover of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins in eukaryotic
        cells and also plays a key role in the regulation of cell
        cycle, signal transduction, transcription as well as
        antigen presentation [ 17 18 19 20 21 ] . Most of the known
        proteasomal substrates are marked and targeted to
        proteasome by ubiquitination [ 17 19 20 ] . Ubiquitination,
        however, is not an obligatory step for substrate targeting
        to proteasome [ 17 18 20 ] . The degradation of the
        ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme for
        polyamine synthesis, involves a protein named antizyme
        (Az), which binds and targets ODC to 26S proteasome for
        degradation [ 18 ] . However, ODC has remained an "orphan"
        in Az-dependent proteasomal degradation.
        Interestingly, both ubiquitin and Az were isolated from
        the yeast two-hybrid system as Smad1 interactors.
        Furthermore, an integral component of proteasome, HsN3 [ 22
        23 24 ] , which is a β subunit of the 20S catalytic core,
        was also isolated as a strong and specific Smad1
        interactor. Functional characterization of the interaction
        between Smad1, Az and HsN3 in the signaling pathways of
        BMPs led us to find a novel functional link between Smad1
        and proteasome-mediated degradation events, through which a
        novel CBP/p300 repressor, SNIP1 [ 25 ] , is removed to
        allow the transcriptional activation of BMP-responsive
        genes.
      
      
        Results
        
          The isolation of Smad1 interacting proteins reveals
          a physical interaction between Smad1 and components in
          proteasome-mediated degradation pathways
          We applied the yeast "Protein Trap" system to isolate
          Smad1 interactors [ 26 27 ] . Full length Smad1 was fused
          with the DNA-binding domain of LexA to serve as bait. A
          human fetal brain cDNA library with cDNA inserts fused
          with the transcriptional activation domain B42 was used
          for the screen. From screening one million cDNA clones,
          40 clones exhibited strong activation of both of the
          reporter genes (LacZ and Leu2). Thirteen different cDNA
          inserts were identified from these 40 clones. The ability
          of these thirteen candidate Smad1 interactors to bind
          Smad1, Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 were directly tested in the
          yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1A). Among the thirteen
          isolated Smad1 interactors, only clones 13, 17, 19 and 21
          bind Smad2, whereas only clones 1, 17 and 21 exhibit
          strong interaction with Smad3. Only one clone (clone 17)
          among the thirteen clones interacts with Smad4.
          Interestingly, this clone encodes a truncated Smad1
          lacking its MH1 domain. Such an interaction is consistent
          with the known ability of Smad1 to bind Smad4 upon its
          activation in mammalian cells [ 9 ] .
          The identities of the thirteen interactors are
          summarized (Fig. 1B, top panel). We divided the
          interactors into three groups (Fig. 1B, top panel). The
          first group contains proteins that have a functional link
          to the degradation pathways of the 26S proteasome. They
          are: two ubiquitin precursors UBA80 (clone 1) and UBA52
          (clone 21), the ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (Az)
          (clone 15) and the proteasome β subunit HsN3 (clone 18).
          The second group contains four known proteins: GST (clone
          13), MBP-1 (c-Myc promoter Binding Protein, clone 14) [
          28 ] , Smad1 (clone 17), TAG (Tumor Associated Gene,
          clone 31) [ 29 ] and PAG (Proliferation Associated Gene,
          clone 35) [ 30 ] . The third group contains four novel
          proteins: clone 19, 12, 27 and 28, which we named as
          SNIP1, SIP2, SIP3 and SIP4, respectively. The functional
          characterization of clone 19 (SNIP1) as a novel CBP/p300
          interactor and repressor has been reported recently in
          the signaling pathways of TGF-β [ 25 ] . The functional
          characterization of clone 12 (SIP2) as a new member of
          the sorting nexin family member has also been reported [
          31 ] . Studies of the novel protein SIP3 will be reported
          separately (Paralkar et al, manuscript in
          preparation).
          We were intrigued by the fact that Smad1 binds to Ub,
          Az and HsN3, all of which are involved in
          proteasome-mediated degradation pathways, as illustrated
          in Fig. 1B, bottom panel. The well-known
          ubiquitin-dependent pathway involves the covalent
          attachment of ubiquitin to substrate proteins to form
          polyubiquitin chain, which then targets the marked
          substrates to proteasome for degradation [ 17 19 20 ] .
          The ubiquitin-independent pathway is not well defined,
          but involves targeting proteins other than ubiquitin. The
          best-characterized example of ubiquitin-independent
          degradation is the degradation of ornithine decarboxylase
          (ODC), which is dependent upon ODC interaction with the
          targeting protein antizyme (Az) [ 18 ] . How
          ubiquitinated substrates or Az-bound ODC is recognized by
          the 26S proteasome is not well understood. HsN3 is a β
          subunit of the 20S core of the 26S proteasome and
          previously has also been implicated in targeting its
          interacting protein p105 subunit of NF-κB into the 26S
          proteasome [ 22 23 24 32 ] . Thus, it is interesting that
          Smad1 can bind to two types of proteasome
          substrate-targeting proteins (ubiquitin and Az) as well
          as a proteasome component (HsN3) that has a possible
          substrate-targeting role. Studies were then carried out
          to further characterize Smad1 interaction with HsN3 and
          Az in mammalian cells and test a functional role of these
          interactions in the signaling pathways of BMPs as
          detailed below.
        
        
          Smad1 interacts with prosequence-containing HsN3
          but not processed HsN3 in the 20S proteasome and the
          activation of the BMP type I receptor enhances the
          interaction
          We first focused upon the physical interaction between
          Smad1 and HsN3. As one of the seven β subunits of the 20S
          proteasome, the newly translated HsN3 has an N-terminal
          44 amino-acid prosequence, which is processed upon the
          complete assembly of HsN3 into the mature 20S proteasome
          [ 22 23 24 ] . The assembly of the 20S proteasome
          involves multiple steps and the formation of assembly
          intermediates [ 33 34 35 36 ] . As illustrated in Fig.
          2A, seven single α subunits first form the α ring, which
          serves as the template for seven β subunits to assemble
          the β ring. The half proteasomes containing one α and one
          β rings are further assembled into 20S proteasome, a
          process involving the proteolytic cleavage of the
          prosequences of five β subunits, including HsN3. The 20S
          proteasome then combines with two 19S regulatory complex
          to form the 26S proteasome, which is the degradation
          machinery responsible for both ubiquitin-dependent and
          ubiquitin-independent degradation [ 37 ] . The
          prosequences of the proteolytic β subunits are important
          to keep the proteolytic sites inaccessible to the
          substrates. In addition, the prosequences still bind to
          the β subunits after its cleavage and may serve important
          chaperon roles for the β subunits to be properly
          positioned into assembly complex. This was demonstrated
          previously by artificially removing the prosequence of
          one β subunit and showed that the assembly of this β
          subunit is completely blocked while separate expression
          of the prosequence was enough to restore the assembly [
          19 ] . The defective assembly of a β subunit due to the
          lack of prosequence is illustrated in Fig. 2B.
          To follow up the observed interaction between Smad1
          and HsN3 in mammalian cells, we first constructed three
          HsN3 expression constructs. The first construct contains
          a Flag-epitope placed at the C-terminus of HsN3 (N3-F),
          since the C-terminus of HsN3 is not buried inside of the
          mature proteasome, according to the crystal structure of
          HsN3 [ 38 ] . The second and the third constructs contain
          either the Flag or the T7 epitopes placed at the
          N-terminus of HsN3 (F-ΔN3, T7-ΔN3). Since the N-terminal
          prosequence of HsN3 is processed upon assembly into the
          20S proteasome, we deleted the prosequence of HsN3 and
          replaced it with the Flag/T7-epitopes to assure that the
          epitopes will not be lost due to prosequence-processing.
          We first expressed these constructs into COS1 cells and
          examined their expression and assembly properties by
          immunoprecipitation of each expressed protein from
          metabolically labeled COS1 cells (Fig. 2C). Multiple
          endogenous proteins from COS1 cells were co-precipitated
          with Flag tagged wild type HsN3 (Fig. 2C, lane 2), while
          much few proteins were detected in the immunoprecipitates
          of the two deletion versions of HsN3 lacking the
          prosequence (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 & 4). The predominant
          band in the immunoprecipitation of wild type HsN3 is the
          prosequence-containing HsN3 (Pro-N3-F), as indicated by
          its molecular weight and the ability of anti-Flag
          antibody to detect it in a parallel Western blot. The
          other predominant band immediately below Pro-N3-F is the
          mature form of Pro-N3-F, as indicated by the ability of
          this band to be also detected by anti-Flag on the Western
          blot and by its co-migration with the deletion version of
          N3 lacking the prosequence (F-ΔN3 in lane 3). The rest of
          the proteins detected in the immunoprecipitates of wild
          type full length HsN3 (Fig. 2C, lane 2) are predominantly
          different subunits of the 20S proteasome and 19S
          regulators, as indicated by their molecular weights and
          their ability to be recognized by anti-20S and anti-19S
          antibodies (data not shown). The lack of most of these
          endogenous proteasome components in the
          immunoprecipitates of the two deletion version of HsN3
          whose prosequences have been artificially removed via
          deletions indicates that the prosequence of HsN3 is also
          important for its successful assembly into the mature 20S
          proteasome. The slight different band patterns detected
          in the immunoprecipitates of F-ΔN3 and T7-ΔN3 suggests
          that different epitope tags may influence N3 interaction
          with endogenous proteasome components. Since mature β
          subunits are only found in the 20S proteasome [ 19 ] ,
          the detection of the mature form of the Flag-tagged HsN3
          assured us that the exogenous Flag-tagged HsN3 proteins
          are normal in their ability to be incorporated into the
          20S proteasome.
          We then tested the ability of HsN3 to bind Smad1 in
          COS1 cells by transient transfection followed by
          immunoprecipitation assays. To monitor the
          co-precipitation of Smad1 with HsN3-containing proteasome
          complexes, immunoprecipitation were carried out using
          total cellular proteins from metabolically labeled COS1
          cells. Upon the immunoprecipitation of Smad1, only the
          full-length HsN3 protein, but not the processed mature
          form of HsN3, was detected to co-precipitate with Smad1
          (Fig. 3A, right panel, lane 4). Although the
          overexpressed HsN3 is associated with many other
          endogenous proteasome components from the COS cells (Fig.
          3A, left panel, lane 4), these endogenous proteins also
          were not detected in the immunoprecipitates of Smad1
          (Fig. 3A, right panel, lane 4). Thus, Smad1 only binds
          the prosequence-containing HsN3 (pro-N3-F), which, as
          illustrated in Fig. 2A, only exists transiently before
          the formation of 20S proteasome. Our domain mapping
          studies in yeast two-hybrid system have previously
          suggested that the MH2 domain of Smad1 is necessary for
          its interaction with HsN3 [ 39 ] . Thus we also tested
          the interaction between HsN3 and Smad1 MH2 domain.
          Pro-N3-F was also detected in the immunoprecipitates of
          Smad1MH2 (Fig. 3A, right panel, lane 3), suggesting that
          the MH2 domain is sufficient to bind to the pre-assembled
          HsN3.
          To test whether the observed interaction between Smad1
          and Pro-N3-F, the pre-assembled form of HsN3, is
          regulated by BMP type I receptor activation, we
          co-expressed Smad1 and HsN3 with a mutant type I
          receptor, ALK3Q233D. ALK3Q233D is constitutively active
          in inducing downstream signaling events in the absence of
          BMPs or the type II receptor [ 40 ] . The co-expression
          of ALK3Q233D with Smad1 and HsN3 significantly increased
          the amount of the pre-assembled HsN3 that was
          co-precipitated with Smad1 (Fig. 3B, right panel, compare
          lanes 2 & 3). Smad1 was also detected in the
          immunoprecipitates of HsN3 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 & 3).
          Since equal transfection efficiency was monitored and
          equal total proteins were used for the
          immunoprecipitation, the increased signals of pro-N3-F
          and its associated proteins in Fig. 3B, lane 3, left
          panel, may reflect an increased stability of HsN3 due to
          complex formation with Smad1, upon BMP receptor
          activation.
          The association between Smad1 and HsN3 was further
          confirmed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot
          analyses. As shown in Fig. 4Aand Fig. 4B, Pro-N3-F was
          specifically detected in the immunoprecipitates of Smad1
          but not those of Smad2. When the activated BMP type I
          receptor was co-expressed with Smad1 and HsN3, a
          reduction of Smad1 level was detected and the reduction
          is blocked by the addition of the proteasome inhibitor
          lactacystin, indicating the proteasomal degradation of
          Smad1 induced by BMP type I receptor activation. This
          phenomenon was further investigated and confirmed in a
          separate study [ 39 ] . The interaction between Pro-N3-F
          and Smad1 was also stabilized in the presence of
          proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (Fig. 4B, lanes 4).
          Western blot using anti-26S proteasome was also carried
          out to show that only Pro-N3-F, not mature N3, nor other
          proteasome components, was co-precipitated with Smad1
          (data not shown).
        
        
          Smad1 can interact with prosequence-deleted HsN3 in
          HsN3 assembly intermediates
          The lack of mature HsN3 and other proteasome
          components in the immunoprecipitates of Smad1 could be
          mediated by two different mechanisms. First, the
          prosequence of HsN3, which is processed from the mature
          HsN3, is necessary for Smad1 to bind to HsN3. Second, the
          final maturation of the 20S proteasome resulted from the
          assembly of two half proteasomes into the four stacked
          ring structure could trap the already bound Smad1 inside
          the proteasome for rapid degradation or lead to the
          dissociation of Smad1 from mature 20S proteasome due to
          the inaccessibility of Smad1 binding site on the
          incorporated HsN3. We first tested the role of the
          prosequence of HsN3 in binding to Smad1. As shown in Fig.
          4C, artificial removal of the prosequence of HsN3 (ΔN3)
          did not abolish Smad1 binding to HsN3. In fact, the
          interaction between ΔN3 and Smad1 was even stronger when
          directly compared with the interaction between wild type
          HsN3 and Smad1 (data not shown). Thus, HsN3 does not
          require the prosequence to bind Smad1. Since we have
          shown that artificial removal of the prosequence of HsN3
          leads to a blockage of the normal assembly of HsN3 into
          the mature proteasome (Fig. 2C), we suspect that the
          detected strong signals of ΔN3 from Smad1
          immunoprecipitates reflect the accumulated HsN3 within
          the defective assembly intermediates, as illustrated in
          Fig. 2B. To test this possibility, we directly compared
          the ability of Smad1 MH2 domain to bind wild type HsN3
          and prosequence-less mutant HsN3 in metabolically labeled
          COS 1 cells (Fig. 4D& 4E). When COS1 cells were
          expressing wild type HsN3, only the Pro-N3-F was detected
          in the immunoprecipitates of Smad1MH2 (Fig. 4D, lane 4).
          When COS1 cells were expressing the mutant HsN3 lacking
          the prosequence, the mutant N3 (ΔN3) and ΔN3 associated
          endogenous proteins were detected in the
          immunoprecipitates of Smad1MH2 (Fig. 4E, lane 4). In
          addition, four distinct small molecular weight proteins
          with unknown identity were also recruited into the
          ΔN3/MH2-containing complex (Fig. 4E, lane 2 and lane 4).
          These four bands were specifically detected only when
          Smad1MH2 and ΔN3 were co-expressed. When Smad1MH2 was
          replaced with full length Smad1, the ΔN3-containing
          complex was also detected in the immunoprecipitates of
          Smad1 (Fig. 4F). Thus, a blockage of HsN3 assembly
          resulted from deleting the prosequence of HsN3 allows the
          detection of a stable complex between Smad1 and HsN3
          assembly intermediates. These data suggest that Smad1
          interacts with HsN3 transiently when HsN3 is either in
          single Pro-HsN3 form, or in Pro-HsN3 assembly
          intermediates. The lack of mature HsN3 in Smad1
          immunoprecipitates does not reflect the inability of
          Smad1 to bind prosequence-less HsN3, but is likely due to
          either the trapping/degradation of Smad1 inside of the
          proteasome, or the rapid dissociation of Smad1 from HsN3.
          The degradation of Smad1 by proteasome is reported in a
          separate study [ 39 ] . The dissociation of Smad1 from
          the mature 20S proteasome could be due to the competition
          of Smad1 binding by a 19S regulator protein or simply due
          to the inaccessibility of the binding site on HsN3 when
          two half proteasomes assembly into the mature
          proteasome.
        
        
          Two separate domains on Az mediate interaction with
          Smad1 and HsN3 prior to HsN3 incorporation into the 20S
          proteasome
          We next examined the interaction between Az and Smad1
          in COS1 cells. In the absence of the co-expressed HsN3,
          Smad1 was co-precipitated with Az (Fig. 5A, top panel,
          lane 1). The interaction was diminished when cells were
          co-transfected with the activated BMP type I receptor
          ALK3Q233D (Fig. 5A, top panel, lane 3). However, the
          addition of proteasome inhibitor LLnL stabilizes the
          interaction (Fig. 5A, top panel, lane 2). Thus, Smad1
          interacts with Az in mammalian cells and the interaction
          is also enhanced upon BMP type I receptor activation. In
          the yeast two-hybrid tests, we also observed the ability
          of Az to bind HsN3 [ 39 ] . Domain mapping analyses of Az
          reveals two separate domains on Az that are involved in
          binding to Smad1 and HsN3 (Fig. 5B). In mammalian cells,
          co-expression of Az with Smad1 and HsN3 leads to the
          detection of both Smad1 and Pro-N3 in the
          immunoprecipitates of Az (Fig. 5C, top panel, lane 6).
          There appears to be a stoichiomatric relationship between
          these three proteins, since the relative levels of these
          three proteins influence the interaction properties (Fig.
          5C). These data suggest that Smad1, Az and HsN3 might
          form a ternary complex. Since we again only detected the
          pro-sequence form of HsN3 in Az precipitates, such a
          ternary complex is likely formed along the assembly
          pathways of HsN3.
        
        
          The Activation of the BMP type I receptor induces
          Smad1-dependent nuclear translocation of both HsN3 and
          Az
          Smad1 is translocated from the cytoplasm to the
          nucleus upon its activation by the BMP type I receptors [
          40 ] . The physical interaction between Smad1, Az and
          HsN3 suggests that BMP signaling might regulate the
          intracellular localization of Az and HsN3. We tested the
          localization of endogenous HsN3 in COS1 cell line, which
          was transiently transfected with Smad1, ALK3 and the BMP
          type II receptor. Cells were either not exposed to BMP2
          (Fig. 6A), or treated with BMP2 for 30 mins (Fig. 6B) or
          60 mins (Fig. 6C). Cells were stained with a monoclonal
          anti-HsN3 antibody and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse
          secondary (Fig. 6A,6B,6C, panels 1) and simultaneously
          with a polyclonal anti-Smad1 antibody and
          rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Fig.
          6A,6B,6C, panels 2). The co-localization of Smad1 and
          HsN3 was detected by overlaying the signals in panels 1
          and panels 2 and shown in panels 3. Smad1 and HsN3 were
          detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in cells
          that were not exposed to BMP2 (Fig. 6A, panels 1-3). In
          cells treated with BMP2 for 30 mins, most HsN3 and Smad1
          were concentrated in the nucleus (Fig. 6B, panels 1 &
          2) and co-localization of Smad1 and HsN3 was detected in
          the nucleus (Fig. 6B, panel 3). In cells treated with
          BMP2 for 60 mins, all signals of Smad1 and HsN3 were
          detected to be co-localized in the nucleus (Fig. 6C,
          panels 1-3).
          We further tested the role of Smad1 in the nuclear
          translocation of HsN3. HsN3 was detected in speckled
          pattern throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus when it
          was expressed alone in COS1 cells (Fig. 6D, panel 1).
          Similar localization pattern was detected when HsN3 was
          co-expressed with Smad1 (Fig. 6D, panel 2) or with
          ALK3Q233D (Fig. 6D, panel 3). However, when HsN3 was
          co-expressed with both Smad1 and ALK3Q233D, the majority
          of HsN3 signals were detected in the nucleus (Fig. 6D,
          panel 4). Thus, the nuclear translocation of HsN3 is
          dependent upon both the receptor activation and the
          presence of Smad1. Similarly, the localization of Az is
          also dependent upon the co-expression of Smad1 and the
          activated BMP type I receptor (Fig. 6E, panels 1-4). When
          Smad1 was replaced by Smad2, Az was found in both the
          cytoplasm and the nucleus upon the co-expression of
          ALK3Q233D (Fig. 6E, panel 4), although cytoplasmic
          signals of Az were slightly decreased. This could be due
          to the presence of endogenous Smad1 in COS1 cells.
          Thus, the localization of both Az and HsN3 is
          regulated by the BMP type I receptor in a Smad1-dependent
          manner. This data confirms the physical interaction
          between Smad1, HsN3 and Az detected by
          immunoprecipitation and further suggests that the
          cytoplasmic Smad1 forms a complex with Az and HsN3 and
          brings these two proteins into the nucleus upon the
          activation of BMP type I receptor.
        
        
          The novel CBP/p300 repressor SNIP1 is recruited to
          Az upon the activation of BMP type I receptor
          The observed physical interaction between Smad1, HsN3
          and Az and the regulation of the complex formation by
          BMPs suggests a functional role of Az and HsN3 in the
          signaling function of Smad1. In a separate study, we have
          shown that Az and HsN3 play targeting roles in the
          proteasomal degradation of Smad1 upon the activation of
          BMP type I receptors [ 39 ] . The observed proteasomal
          degradation of Smad1 upon the activation of BMP signaling
          could simply serve to irreversibly terminate
          Smad1-mediated signaling pathways of BMPs. However, we
          observed that Az and HsN3 also interact with several
          isolated Smad1 interactors. Furthermore, the nuclear
          co-translocation of Az and HsN3 with Smad1 also suggests
          potential proteasomal targeting role of Az and HsN3 in
          the nucleus. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that Az and
          HsN3 also target Smad1 interacting proteins in the
          nucleus.
          Among the isolated Smad1 interactors shown in Fig. 1,
          clone 19 encodes a novel nuclear protein named as Smad1
          Nuclear Interacting Protein-1 (SNIP-1). Our recent
          studies suggested that SNIP1 is a novel CBP/p300
          repressor [ 25 ] . SNIP1, when expressed in COS1 cells,
          is entirely localized to distinct areas within the
          nucleus (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, SNIP1 binds to Az and
          HsN3 in the yeast two-hybrid system, in addition to its
          ability to bind Smad1 (Fig. 7B). SNIP1 and ODC exhibited
          similar affinity to Az in the yeast two-hybrid test (Fig.
          7B). Domain mapping studies showed that the linker region
          of Smad1 was sufficient to bind SNIP1 (Fig. 7C). To
          confirm the interaction between SNIP1 and Az or HsN3 seen
          in the yeast two-hybrid system, we transfected COS1 cells
          with each pair of proteins and tested the interactions by
          immunoprecipitation assays. Upon the co-expression with
          SNIP1, the pre-assembled form of HsN3 but not Az was
          co-precipitated with SNIP1 (Fig. 7D, lanes 1 & 2).
          Since SNIP1 is a nuclear protein, the interaction between
          SNIP1 and Az may require the nuclear translocation of Az.
          Based upon the observation that the nuclear translocation
          of Az is dependent upon Smad1 and BMP type I receptor
          activation (Fig. 6E), we therefore tested Az interaction
          with SNIP1 in the presence of the co-expression of Smad1,
          Smad4 and ALK3Q233D. In the absence of ALK3Q233D, no F-Az
          was detected in the precipitates of SNIP1 (Fig. 7E, top
          panel, lane 2). However, the co-expression of ALK3Q233D
          allowed the detection of F-Az in SNIP1 immunoprecipitates
          (Fig. 7E, top panel, lane 3). A weak Smad1 signal but no
          Smad4 signal was detected in SNIP1
          immunoprecipitates.
          Thus, in the mammalian overexpression system, the
          pre-assembled HsN3 exhibits constitutive interaction with
          SNIP1, whereas Az is only recruited to SNIP1 upon
          receptor activation. The lack of strong signals of Smad1
          or Smad4 in the immunoprecipitates of SNIP1 in the
          presence of BMP type I receptor activation may be due to
          the transient nature of the complex, which, as shown
          below, is targeted to proteasome for degradation.
        
        
          BMP type I receptor activation induces SNIP1
          degradation that is regulated by Smad1, Smad4 and
          Az
          To follow the observed reduction of SNIP1 level upon
          the expression of high level of ALK3Q233D, as mentioned
          above, we co-expressed SNIP1 together with Smad1, Smad4,
          Az and high dose (6 μg) of either the wild type ALK3 or
          the constitutive active ALK3Q233D. The protein levels of
          each protein were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 8A). A
          dramatic decrease of SNIP1 level was detected in
          ALK3Q233D-transfected cells (Fig. 8A, panel 1, lanes 1
          & 2). The receptor activation-induced decrease of
          SNIP1 is partially sensitive to the proteasome-specific
          inhibitor lactacystin, suggesting the involvement of
          proteasomal degradation (Fig. 8A, panel 1, lane 3). The
          incomplete rescue of SNIP1 level by lactacystin suggests
          the involvement of additional mechanisms other than 26S
          proteasome in SNIP1 degradation. To systematically
          demonstrate the role of Smad1, Smad4 and Az in the
          observed decrease of SNIP1 protein level, we sequentially
          left out one of these three proteins in the above assay.
          The ALK3Q233D-induced degradation of SNIP1 was
          significantly blocked in the absence of Az (Fig. 8A,
          panel 1, lanes 4 & 5), Smad4 (lanes 6 & 7), or
          Smad1 (lanes 8 & 9). Thus, the ALK3Q233D-induced
          degradation of SNIP1 is regulated by the protein levels
          of Smad1, Smad4, Az and is only induced by high dose of
          the activated BMP type I receptor. Interestingly, by
          simply replacing Smad1 with the Smad1 mutant Smad1G419S [
          40 ] , which is defective in binding to BMP type I
          receptor for receptor-mediated phosphorylation and the
          subsequent nuclear translocation, SNIP1 degradation was
          also inhibited (Fig. 8A, panel 1, lanes 10 & 11),
          suggesting that the degradation of SNIP1 is dependent
          upon the type I receptor-mediated phosphorylation of
          Smad1. The levels of SNIP1 in Fig. 8Atop panel are
          quantified and plotted as Integrated Optical Density
          (IOD) of SNIP1 (Fig. 8A, right panel).
          We noted that the protein levels of Smad1, Smad4 and
          Az were co-regulated with that of SNIP1. For example, the
          protein levels of Smad1, Smad4 and Az were all sensitive
          to lactacystin (Fig. 8A, all panels, compare lane 2 and
          lane 3). Blocking SNIP1 degradation was accompanied by
          increased protein levels of Smad1, Smad4 and Az in cells
          expressing the activated ALK3 (Fig. 8A, lanes 5, 7, 9,
          11). The lower levels of Smad1, Smad4, Az and SNIP1 in
          lane 1 compared with those in lane 10 suggest that the
          leaky signaling by the overexpressed ALK3, which we have
          demonstrated recently [ 39 ] , caused a constitutive
          reduction of Smad4, Az and SNIP1 level that is dependent
          upon the activation of Smad1. These data thus suggest
          that SNIP1 is targeted to proteasome for degradation
          together with Smad1, Az and Smad4.
          The ability of Smad1 in regulating SNIP1 degradation
          was further demonstrated by increased expression of Smad1
          in COS1 cells that were transfected with a constant
          amount of Smad4, Az, ALK3Q233D and SNIP1 (Fig. 8B). A
          dose-dependent effect of Smad1 on receptor-induced
          degradation of SNIP1 was observed (Fig. 8B, compare lanes
          1 & 2 with lanes 5 & 6).
          To confirm SNIP1 degradation in non-overexpression
          systems, we monitored the steady state levels of
          endogenous SNIP1 in the human keratinocyte HaCaT and
          mouse myoblast L6. Cells were treated with BMP7 for
          different periods of time. Western blot analyses using an
          anti-SNIP1 antibody detected two forms of SNIP1 with
          slightly different mobility, which are named as SNIP1.A
          and SNIP1.B (Fig. 8C, top panel). The IOD of each form of
          SNIP1 as well as the total IOD of both forms are plotted
          (Fig. 8C, right panel). In HaCaT cells, the protein
          levels of both forms of SNIP1 were significantly
          decreased after 3 hrs of BMP7 treatment and were almost
          diminished by 22 hrs. Interestingly, a different response
          was observed in L6 cells. The levels of SNIP1 were
          somewhat increased after 3 hrs and peaked at 3.5 hrs, but
          then started to decline at 7 hrs and were diminished at
          22 hrs.
        
        
          SNIP1 is a nuclear repressor of the BMP-induced
          transcription responses
          To determine the functional significance of the
          observed SNIP1 degradation induced by BMPs, we tested the
          role of SNIP1 in Smad1-regulated gene responses of BMPs.
          We first tested the effect of SNIP1 on the BMP-induced
          activation of the Tlx2 promoter, which involves Smad1 [
          41 ] . Full length SNIP1 exhibits dose-dependent
          inhibition of the BMP-induced gene activation, as
          monitored by the luciferase activities (Fig. 9A). Thus,
          SNIP1 is an inhibitor of BMP-induced gene response. Since
          we have previously shown that SNIP1 binds and inhibits
          CBP/p300 via its N-terminal domain [ 25 ] , the deletion
          mutant of SNIP1 lacking the CBP/p300 binding site, SNIP1
          (142-369), was tested in the same assay. SNIP1 (142-369)
          exhibits little inhibitory activity towards the gene
          response (Fig. 9A, see ΔN-SNIP1). This data further
          suggests that the inhibitory activity of SNIP1 is
          mediated by its interaction with CBP/p300, similar to
          what has been reported in the TGF-β pathways [ 25 ] . We
          next tested the inhibitory activity of SNIP1 on the
          transcriptional activity of Smad1, using the GAL4-Smad1
          and GAL4-Luc reporter system, as described previously [
          42 43 ] . SNIP1 inhibited BMP-induced activation of
          GAL4-Luc in p19 cells transfected with GAL4-Smad1 (Fig.
          9B). The proteasome specific inhibitor lactacystin also
          inhibited the BMP-induced GAL4-Smad1 transcriptional
          activity (Fig. 9B), consistent with a role of proteasomal
          degradation in Smad1-mediated transcription. The effect
          of lactacystin is specific, since the control reporter
          gene β-Gal was not inhibited by lactacystin (data not
          shown). In a separate study, we also demonstrated that
          proteasomal degradation also plays an essential role in
          BMP induced dendritic formation of rat sympathetic
          neurons [ 44 ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are
        multi-functional regulators of early embryogenesis and
        tissue/organ morphogenesis. Observations made in the past
        several years suggest that a subset of Smad family proteins
        play key roles in transmitting the signals of BMPs from the
        activated receptors at the cell surface to the nucleus to
        regulate gene expression. Smad1, as one of the three known
        R-Smads of BMPs, has been extensively studied within the
        scope of its phosphorylation, interaction with Smad4,
        nuclear translocation, DNA binding and protein-protein
        interactions related to its function as a transcriptional
        regulator. Currently, Smad1 is regarded as a DNA-binding
        transcriptional modulator that is activated by the BMP type
        I receptors. Considering the sophisticated mode of
        regulation characteristic of the TGF-β/BMP family ligands,
        it is expected that that signaling mechanisms of Smads
        should have a nature of complexity that can accommodate the
        vast biological functions of these regulators. We took a
        discovery-driven approach to study the signaling mechanism
        of Smad1, by systematically searching for proteins that can
        physically interact with Smad1. Such an approach led to the
        identification of a set of proteins that can specifically
        bind to Smad1. This report has focused upon the functional
        characterization of two proteins that function along the
        degradation pathways of the 26S proteasome: antizyme (Az)
        and HsN3.
        Az was previously identified as a polyamine-inducible
        factor that binds and targets the ornithine decarboxylase
        (ODC) to proteasome for degradation [ 18 45 ] . Until now,
        ODC is the only protein known to be targeted by Az to
        proteasome, although the existence of additional proteins
        targeted by Az to proteasome has been suspected [ 20 ] . We
        now find two new Az interactors: Smad1, the key signal
        transducer of BMPs, as well as SNIP1, the nuclear repressor
        of CBP/p300. In a separate study, we demonstrated that
        Smad1 is targeted to proteasome for degradation, a process
        involving the co-targeting role of Az and HsN3 [ 39 ] .
        Here we showed that SNIP1, after being recruited to Az, is
        targeted, together with Smad1, to proteasome for
        degradation. These data indicate that Az has a more general
        role in targeting different substrates to proteasome for
        degradation. However, unlike the known ability of Az to
        bind ODC constitutively, the interaction between SNIP1 and
        Az is dependent upon the activation of BMP type I receptor
        and occurs in the presence of Smad1 and Smad4. This
        suggests the existence of a novel BMP-regulated
        "conditional" targeting activity of Az that is distinct
        from the constitutive targeting activity of Az towards
        ODC.
        HsN3 is one of the seven β subunits of the 20S
        proteasome, which is the catalytic core of the 26S
        proteasome [ 22 23 24 ] . Besides its role as an
        indispensable component of the 20S proteasome, HsN3 and the
        α subunit HC9 of the 20S proteasome have been shown to
        interact with the viral protein Tax. This interaction was
        suggested to play a role in Tax-induced proteasomal
        processing of the P105 subunit of NF-κB [ 32 ] . Other
        proteasome integral components, especially those in the 19S
        regulator of the 26S proteasome, have also been shown to
        bring proteins to proteasome for degradation [ 21 ] . Here
        we identified a unique role of HsN3 in the Az-involved
        targeting pathway that is coupled to BMP type I receptor
        activation. Our data suggests that Smad1 and Az both
        interact with HsN3 only before HsN3 is fully incorporated
        into the mature 20S proteasome. We have shown that the
        reason for Smad1 to only bind to the unprocessed form of
        HsN3 is not because the prosequence contains a
        Smad1-binding site. Artificially removing the prosequence
        of HsN3 in fact allowed Smad1 to stably bind to the
        prosequence-less HsN3 as well as multiple proteins that are
        bound to the prosequence-less HsN3, which may represent the
        assembly intermediates that failed to reach maturation due
        to the lack of HsN3 prosequence (Fig. 4D,4E,4F). These data
        collectively point out the transient interaction between
        Smad1 and HsN3 along the assembly of HsN3 into the 20S
        proteasome. So far, several proteins have been found to
        interact with assembly intermediates of the 20S proteasome.
        A small protein Ump1 associates with the premature
        proteasome complexes and is shown to be involved in
        assisting the maturation of 20S proteasome, possibly by
        interacting with the β rings of half proteasomes [ 46 ] .
        Upon the maturation of the 20S proteasome, Ump1 is trapped
        inside the proteasome and is degraded by proteasome [ 46 ]
        . The HSP70 like chaperon protein Hsc73 also associates
        with the 16S proteasome precursor complexes [ 35 36 ] . The
        exact role of Hsc73 in 16S precursor proteasome complex is
        not known, but has been suggested to assist proteasome
        maturation [ 35 36 ] . Our studies add Smad1, Smad1
        interacting proteins such as SNIP1, Smad4, and Az as
        additional proteins that associate with the assembly
        intermediates. How does the association of HsN3 contribute
        to the final degradation or processing of these proteins?
        Two possible mechanisms are illustrated in Fig. 10A. The
        first possible mechanism is via "Unfold and Trap". The
        proteasome assembly intermediates could be a site for the
        entry of substrates into the degradation chamber via an
        unfold-trap mechanism that is coupled to the final
        maturation of the 20S proteasome. The chaperon proteins
        such as Hsc73 could be involved in unfolding the substrates
        for them to fit into the degradation chamber and the final
        maturation of 20S proteasome from the 16S assembly
        intermediates could trap the substrates, such as Ump1 and
        Smads, inside the degradation chamber. If so,
        ubiquitination may not be necessary for the degradation.
        This could be a common mechanism for ubiquitin-independent
        degradation pathways. The second possible mechanism is via
        "docking and delivery". HsN3 may simply bring the Smad/Az
        containing complex close enough to the 26S proteasome and
        then delivers it to the 19S complex via Az interaction with
        its receptor within 19S regulator.
        We have so far identified two functional outcomes of the
        observed physical interaction between Smad1, HsN3 and Az in
        the signaling pathways of BMPs. First, in a separate
        report, we showed that Smad1 itself is targeted to
        proteasome and is subsequently degraded by the proteasome,
        an event that is triggered by the activation of BMP type I
        receptor and involves the targeting role of Az and HsN3 [
        39 ] . Proteasomal degradation of Smad1 appears to also
        play a role in regulating the constitutive level of Smad1
        in cell as a way to adjust the cellular responsiveness of
        BMPs [ 47 ] . However, the targeting mechanism and the
        regulation involved in these two cases of Smad1 degradation
        by proteasome are likely fundamentally different [ 39 ] .
        The second functional outcome of the physical link between
        Smad1, HsN3 and Az is the ability of Smad1 to regulate the
        proteasomal degradation of SNIP1, which is clearly
        dependent upon high levels of Smad1, Az and a strong
        activation signal from the type I receptor, as suggested by
        the observations that the protein levels of Smad1, Az and
        ALK3Q233D directly influence the degree of SNIP1
        degradation. While the detailed mechanisms for such a novel
        mode of regulation still requires many additional studies,
        so far we observed several important steps that may
        contribute to SNIP1 degradation. First, Smad1 binds both
        HsN3 and Az in the cytoplasm and brings them into the
        nucleus upon the activation of BMP type I receptor (Fig.
        6). Second, SNIP1 is recruited to Az and HsN3, which are
        likely in a complex with Smad1 and Smad4 (Fig. 7D& 7E).
        Third, SNIP1 is co-targeted into the proteasome with Smad1,
        Smad4 and Az via the rapid assembly of HsN3 into the
        proteasome. This is suggested by the observations that the
        targeting of SNIP1 is positively regulated by Smad1 level
        and is dependent upon Smad1, Smad4 and Az (Fig. 8A&
        8B). Fourth, Smad4 is a positive regulator of the targeting
        of SNIP1 to proteasome. The requirement of both Smad1 and
        Smad4 in the down-regulation of SNIP1 is interesting since
        this may represent an important molecular mechanism for the
        co-operative property of these Smads to modulate
        transcription. The functional significance of SNIP1
        degradation is apparent, since SNIP1 is a constitutive
        interactor and functional repressor of the master
        transcription co-activator CBP/p300 [ 25 ] . In the BMP
        signaling pathways, SNIP1 is a potent inhibitor of
        Smad-responsive genes via inhibiting CBP/p300 (Fig. 9A).
        Thus the down-regulation of SNIP1 likely leads to the
        liberation of CBP/p300 and directly contributes to the
        well-known transcriptional modulator functions of Smad1 and
        Smad4. These ideas are summarized in a cartoon in Fig. 10B.
        Specifically, the activated Smad1 and Smad4 enter the
        nucleus, where Smad1 and Smad4 together recruit SNIP1 and
        CBP/p300. The inhibition of SNIP1 on CBP/p300 is considered
        to act through its interaction with the C/H1 domain of
        CBP/p300, thereby blocking the recruitment of CBP/p300 by
        other transcription factors including Smad4 [ 25 ] . Such
        an inhibition is counteracted by the ability of Smad4 to
        compete off SNIP1 from CBP/p300 [ 25 ] . So at early phase
        of Smad activation, although SNIP1 is still bound to Smad1
        and Smad4, it is no longer directly bound to CBP/p300,
        which now can activate transcription. Our data suggested
        that the Smad1/Smad4 bound SNIP1 can be further targeted to
        proteasome for degradation. Smad1 and Smad4 are indeed both
        degraded. However, we propose that such degradation is
        coupled to the recruitment of the SNIP1-free CBP/p300 to a
        nearby DNA-binding transcription factor, thus carrying out
        the commonly observed role of Smads as transcriptional
        co-modulators. Smads have been shown to mediate
        transcription via modulating the transcriptional activity
        of many other DNA-binding proteins. The ability of Smad1
        and Smad4 to target SNIP1 for degradation, thereby freeing
        CBP/p300 for other transcriptional factors is likely an
        important mechanism for the transcriptional modulator role
        of these two Smads.
        We have observed that several other Smad1 interactors,
        including some cytoplasmic interactors of Smad1, are also
        degraded by proteasome (Wang et al., unpublished data).
        Thus, the location for the targeting of Smad1 may not be
        limited to only inside of the nucleus, as illustrated in
        Fig. 10B. Future studies are needed to verify and enrich
        the details of the illustrated molecular events.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The subject of proteasomal degradation of Smads and Smad
        interacting proteins has now become a major focus of
        interest in the field due to its broad implication in
        signaling regulation and execution. The work reported here
        represents our major efforts during the past several years
        to follow a novel concept of proteasomal degradation in
        TGF-β/BMP signaling based upon the yeast two-hybrid data
        obtained in 1996. Although there are multiple reports on
        proteasomal degradation of Smads and Smad interacting
        proteins, primarily in TGF-β signaling pathways [ 47 48 49
        50 51 52 53 54 ] , our observations reported here are
        entirely based upon our own original observations and show
        a novel connection of Smads with the proteasome system that
        no other groups have reported. Our observations provide new
        revenues for future understanding of the functional
        mechanisms of Smads, which are likely not limited to
        transcriptional regulation but are quite extensively linked
        to the regulation of proteasomal degradation of multiple
        cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Construction of expression plasmids
          For the yeast two-hybrid screen, full-length Smad1 was
          subcloned into BamH1/Not1 sites of PEG202 by a PCR
          method, resulting in the inframe fusion between the LexA
          DNA binding domain (1-202) and Smad1. The Smad1 (G419S)
          mutant was a kind gift from J. Wrana [ 40 ] . The
          subcloning of Smad1 (G419S), Smad1NL (1-271), Smad1L
          (147-271) into pEG202 were all carried out similarly by
          the PCR approach. The mammalian expression constructs of
          Smad1 and its deletion mutant Smad1C (271-465) were made
          by subcloning Smad1 into two modified pCMV6 vectors,
          which have either the Flag epitope (F-pCMV6) or the T7
          epitope (T7-pCMV6) placed upstream of an array of new
          multiple cloning sites. T7-ΔN3 pCMV6 was made by PCR
          amplification of HsN3 (a.a. 45-263) followed by
          subcloning the PCR products into the EcoR1/Xho1 sites of
          the modified T7-pCMV6 vector. N3-F pCMV6 was made by PCR
          amplification of HsN3 (1-263) followed by subcloning the
          PCR products into the EcoR1/EcoRV sites of pFlag-CMV5C
          vector (Kodak). The fidelity of the PCR products was
          determined by DNA sequencing. The constitutively active
          mutant BMP type I receptor (ALK3Q233D) is a gift from J.

          rat Az is from P. Coffino.
        
        
          Yeast two-hybrid screen and tests
          A modified yeast two-hybrid system developed by Brent
          and colleagues [ 26 27 ] . was used to isolate Smad1
          interactors. Briefly, yeast strain EGY48 (leu2, his3,
          trp1, ura3), which has an integrated Leu2 reporter, was
          first transformed with a LexAop-LacZ reporter. The
          selected transformants were transformed again with the
          bait construct Smad1pEG202. The selected bait
          transformants were transformed with a human fetal brain
          cDNA library (a gift from Roger Brent). About one million
          original transformants were obtained. From the pooled
          stock of the transformants, ten million cells were
          screened on U -H -W -L -galactose plates containing X-Gal
          (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactosidase). Only
          those that form blue colonies were picked as candidate
          positives. The cDNAs from the candidate positives were
          purified, re-tested for Smad1 interaction in yeast, and
          then sequenced. For testing protein-protein interaction
          using the yeast two-hybrid system, the same yeast strain
          was first transformed with the LexA-fusion construct,
          selected on U -H -plates, then re-transformed with
          B42-fusion constructs, and selected on U -H -W -plates.
          The transformants were first streaked onto a master
          plate, then replicated onto two testing plates: U -H -W
          -glucose plate with X-Gal and U -H -W
          -galactose/raffinose plate with X-Gal. For presentation,
          yeast transformants were also directly streaked onto U -H
          -W -galactose/raffinose plate with X-Gal, after
          confirming lack of the auto-activation on glucose
          plates.
        
        
          Transient transfection, 35S-metabolic labeling,
          immunoprecipitation and western blot
          Equal amount of total plasmids were used to
          transiently transfect COS-1 using the DEAE dextran method
          [ 40 ] . A GFP construct was used to monitor the
          transfection efficiency. 293 cells were transfected by
          the standard CaPO 
          4 procedure [ 55 ] and cells were
          harvested 24 hrs after tansfection. For metabolic
          labeling, cells were incubated with 250 μCi
          35S-methionine per plate for 4 hrs, two days after
          transfection. To make lysates, transfected cells were
          washed with cold HBSS, scraped, lysed on ice in 300 μl
          lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, PH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5%
          Triton X-100, 1mM EDTA) containing protease inhibitors.
          Protein expression level was determined by Western blot
          analyses of 20 μl lysates before any immunoprecipitation
          assays. For immunoprecipitation, 150 μl cell lysates were
          pre-cleaned by protein A sepharose beads (Pharmacia),
          incubated with 3 μl of anti-T7 (1 mg/ml) or anti-Flag (3
          mg/ml) (M2 monoclonal, IBI, Eastman Kodak) on ice
          overnight. Protein A (for anti-T7) and protein G (for
          anti-Flag) sepharose beads were used to absorb the
          antibodies. After washing, beads were treated with
          protein sample buffer to elute immunoprecipitates. Eluted
          proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE. The detection of the
          co-precipitated proteins was carried out either by
          autoradiography, if proteins were metabolically labeled
          or by Western blot using the ECL kit. When proteasome
          inhibitors were applied, the inhibitors LLnL (50 mM in
          DMSO) or lactacystin (10 mM in H 
          2 O) were added directly to the cell
          medium at 1:1000 dilutions. Lactacystin was purchased
          from E. J. Corey laboratory at Harvard University. LLnL
          was purchased from Sigma.
        
        
          Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy
          Immunocytochemistry was carried out as described
          previously [ 40 ] . Briefly, COS cells were grown to 50%
          confluency on gelatin-coated glass cover slips. Cells
          were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids
          (total 10 μg) using the DEAE dextran method. About 48 hrs
          after transfection, cells were fixed in 4%
          paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and then permeablized with
          methanol for 2 mins. Cells were blocked in 10% goat
          serum/PBS for 1 hr at room temperature, before the
          sequential incubation with the primary and secondary
          antibodies. The monoclonal anti-HsN3 (MCP444) is a gift
          from K. B. Hendil. The polyclonal anti-Smad1 antibody is
          a gift from A. Roberts. The secondary antibodies were
          either FITC-conjugated, or Rodamine-conjugated goat
          anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Westgrove
          PA).
          Confocal Microscopy was carried out on a Leica TCS 4D
          Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope at the Schepens Eye
          Research Institute (Boston MA).
        
        
          Luciferase assays
          P19 cells were seeded in 100 mm dish and cultured for
          24 hrs before they were transfected with luciferase
          reporter constructs using Fugene Kit (Roche). Each group
          of transfected cells was re-seeded into eight separate
          wells in a 24-well plate 18 hrs after transfection.
          Eighteen hrs after re-seeding, cells were washed twice
          with 1 ml serum-free media and left in 200 μl media. Four
          out of eight dishes of each group were exposed to BMP7
          (25 ng/ml BMP7), which was directly added into the media
          for 24 hrs. Culture media was then removed and 100 μl of
          Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega 5X stock, diluted with H 
          2 O) was added to the cells, which
          were then frozen at -80°C for 3 hrs. The plates were
          thawed and 70 μl of supernatant was transferred to
          luciferase plates, mixed with 70 μl of luciferase reagent
          (Promega). The luciferase activity was detected on Wallac
          Victor 1420 plate reader. To normalize data, cells were
          also transfected with β-Gal reporter and the
          β-galactosidase activities measured using the
          Galacto-star kit (Tropix, BM300S).
