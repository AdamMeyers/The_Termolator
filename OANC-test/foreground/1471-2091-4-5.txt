        Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a serine
        proteinase inhibitor in the serpin superfamily [ 1 2 3 ] .
        This 50 kDa glycoprotein is apparently the most important
        physiological inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen
        activator (tPA) and of urokinase plasminogen activator
        (uPA). [ 4 ] It was shown to play a crucial role in the
        regulation of vascular thrombosis, tumor invasion,
        neovascularization, inflammation and wound healing. [ 5 6 ]
        Increased plasma levels of PAI-1 were found to be
        correlated with an increased risk for cardiovascular
        diseases. [ 6 7 8 ] The essential function of PAI-1 in the
        fibrinolytic system has been confirmed by studies with
        transgenic animals. [ 7 9 ]
        PAI-1 shares a 35% homology with 40 other serpins. [ 10
        ] The X-ray structure of active PAI-1 [ 11 12 ] consists of
        three sheets (A-C), nine helices (a-i) and a reactive
        center loop (RCL). The RCL contains the residues Ser331 to
        Arg356 (P16-P10'), and within it there is a peptide loop
        (Glu 351 to Pro 357, P5'-P11'), which is defined as the
        distal hinge (Table 1). It should be noted that the
        placement and conformation of the RCL in active PAI-1 is
        quite different from that of latent PAI-1. [ 13 ] The
        movement of the distal hinge and the insertion of the RCL
        into sheet A as strand 4A (s4A) should take place during
        the transition from the active into the latent form of
        PAI-1.
        The catalytic center of tPA interacts with the reactive
        site of PAI-1 with concominant formation of 1:1 molar,
        SDS-stable complex. The P1 (Arg346) residue in the RCL of
        PAI-1 is an essential determinant for its target
        specificity and inhibitory activity. [ 14 15 ] Since many
        serpins with identical amino acid residue at P1 position
        display different specificities, it is unlikely that the P1
        residue is the sole determinant for target protease
        specificity, other regions of PAI-1 may also affect its
        specificity toward target proteases. The variable region in
        serine proteases domain determines their specificity for
        PAI-1. Alignment of variable region 1 of the serine
        proteases shows a remarkable correlation between the
        composition of this area and their susceptibility to
        inhibition by PAI-1 as shown in Table 2. [ 16 ] Both tPA
        and uPA, the target proteases of PAI-1, contain a
        relatively extensive variable region 1, consisting of four
        to five positively charged amino acid residues present at
        identical position. Plasmin and thrombin with moderate
        reactivity toward PAI-1 have relatively short variable
        regions which contain only two to three positively charged
        residues. For example, positively charged amino acids in
        the variable region of tPA, uPA and thrombin play dominant
        roles in the specific interaction with PAI-1. [ 17 18 19 ]
        Furthermore, Glu350 (P4') of PAI-1 has been shown to
        mediate the interactions with tPA. [ 18 ]
        In this study, By producing wtPAI-1 and several single
        site mutations in the distal hinge of PAI-1 in a
        baculovirus expression system, we were able to find out the
        role of the distal hinge in conformational transition of
        PAI-1 and to elucidate the role of Glu351 in PAI-1 for
        serine protease specificities.
      
      
        Results
        
          Characterization of wtPAI-1
          To confirm the validity of recombinant PAI-1 as a
          model to study the native inhibitor secreted from human
          fibrosarcoma cells, we compared the recombinant PAI-1 and
          the fibrosarcoma PAI-1 first by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot
          with anti-PAI-1 monoclonal antibodies. The molecular
          weight of wtPAI-1 was found to be lower than native PAI-1
          (~50 kDa, Fig. 1B). We assumed that this is due to a
          lower (probably different) extent of glycosylation in the
          baculovirus expression system. Indeed, when both proteins
          were deglycosylated with N-glycanase they were found to
          have an essentially identical M.W. (~48 kDa) and to
          cross-react immunochemically (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, when
          this wtPAI-1 was chromatographed on heparin-Sepharose it
          was found to be > 98% pure by silver staining of the
          gel (Fig. 1Alane 2).
          Interestingly, the specific inhibitory activity of
          wtPAI was 63 ± 15 U/ug just after purification, and was
          increased to 84 ± 21 U/ug after denatured by 6 M Gdn-HCl
          and refolded in 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.6) at 4°C. In
          contrast, the specific activity of the fibrosarcoma PAI-1
          was only 5 ± 3 U/ug before activation, and was only
          increased to 45 ± 16 U/μg after denaturing and refolding.
          The high specific inhibitory activity of wt-PAI-1 could
          be due to the fact that it was secreted from insect
          High-5 cells cultured at 27°C, while the fibrosarcoma
          preparation of PAI-1 was obtained from the medium of
          fibrosarcoma cells cultured at 37°C [ 20 ] . Exposure to
          the higher temperature could accelerate the conversion of
          the inhibitor into its latent form.
          The functional stability of wtPAI-1 and the
          fibrosarcoma PAI-1 in the absence or in presence of
          vitronectin are illustrated in Figure 1C. wtPAI-1 lost
          its inhibitory activity at the same pace as the
          fibrosarcoma PAI-1, indicating that its functional half
          life as an inhibitor and its ability to be stabilized by
          vitronectin are similar to those of the fibrosarcoma
          PAI-1.
          The second-order rate constants (in M -1s -1units) of
          the fibrosarcoma PAI-1 and the wtPAI-1 towards t-PA were
          1.4 ± 0.5 × 10 7and 1.7 ± 0.6 × 10 7, and towards uPA
          were 4.1 ± 1.4 × 10 7and 4.4 ± 1.6 × 10 7, respectively.
          These results show that the wtPAI-1 could inhibit tPA or
          uPA at the same rate as the fibrosarcoma PAI-1. In
          addition, it is known that PAI-1 inhibits either tPA or
          uPA by forming a 1:1 SDS stable complex [ 4 ] , wtPAI-1
          indeed could form SDS stable complex with tPA or uPA
          (Fig. 3A) just as fibrosarcoma PAI-1.
        
        
          Single site mutations within the distal hinge of
          PAI-1
          Since a proline occurs not only in position 357 of
          PAI-1, but also in the corresponding position of several
          other serpins (Table 1) we attempted to find out how does
          a mutation of P357 affect the inhibitory activity of
          PAI-1. Mutant of Pro357Gly blocked the inhibitory
          activity of PAI-1 (Fig. 2A). Similarly, a mutation into
          proline of either Asp355 or Arg356 also inactivated the
          inhibitor. It should be noted that all these mutants
          could be activated to a similar extent by 6 M Gnd-HCl
          (~20% inhibitory activity of the wtPAI-1, activated under
          the same conditions). These results suggest that a single
          site mutation at either one of the positions 355, 356 or
          357 significantly inactivates PAI-1.
          To elucidate the mechanism through which such
          mutations affect the activity of PAI-1, we determined
          their effect on the functional stability of PAI-1 and on
          its ability to form an SDS stable complex with either tPA
          or uPA. As seen in Fig. 2B, the rate of the spontaneous
          inactivation of the inhibitor was significantly increased
          upon mutation: the functional half life of the mutants
          Asp355Pro, Arg356Pro and Pro357Gly was 23.8 ± 4.5 min,
          26.2 ± 3.7 min and 24.7 ± 4.8 min, respectively, while
          that of wtPAI-1 was 89.8 ± 8.7 min. Interestingly, there
          was no significant difference between the mutants tested
          and the wtPAI-1 in their ability to inactivate either tPA
          or uPA (Table 3). They could also form SDS-stable
          complexes with tPA or uPA just as well as wtPAI-1 (Fig.
          3A).
          An interesting structural similarity among several
          serpins is known to occur at the position corresponding
          to 355 in PAI-1. While in PAI-1 this position
          accommodates a negatively charged aspartic acid residue,
          in other serpins it sometimes accommodates its non
          charged analog asparagine (Table 1). Asp355His,
          Asp355Lys, Asp355Glu, Asp355Gln and Asp355Asn were
          prepared and used to show that the negatively charged
          aspartic acid in PAI-1 is essential (though not
          sufficient) for its inhibitory activity. Mutation of
          Asp355 by asparagine (the non charged analog of aspartic
          acid), or by histidine or lysine (that have a positively
          charged side chain) or by alanine (neutral), inactivated
          PAI-1. Replacement of this aspartic acid residue even by
          the negatively charged glutamic acid (a very close analog
          of aspartic acid) did not significantly suffice to
          restore a full inhibitory activity of PAI-1 (Fig. 3B).
          After activation with 6 M Gnd-HCl, each of the six
          mutants exhibited a relatively high inhibitory activity,
          but their specific activities were still much lower than
          that of wtPAI-1 (Fig. 3B). Among them, Asp355Lys (5.1 ±
          4.1 U/ug) had the lowest specific activity, while the
          Asp355Asn (20 ± 4.2 U/μg) had the highest specific
          activity (Fig. 3B). Although they had lower specific
          activities, all of the mutants mentioned above could
          still form SDS-stable complexes with tPA or uPA just as
          the wtPAI-1 (data not shown).
          Two additional mutations, Arg356Ala and Arg356Glu,
          were prepared to further elucidate the role of Arg356.
          The specific inhibitory activity of Arg356Ala was 7.2 ±
          2.5 U/μg, while Arg356Glu exhibited essentially no
          inhibitory activity. This specific activity was increased
          to 35.4 ± 8.7 U/ug for Arg356Ala and 6.4 ± 2.3 U/μg for
          Arg356Glu after denature and refolding. Just like
          ARG356Pro, Arg356Ala and Arg356Glu were much more labile
          than wtPAI-1. These results suggest that the role of the
          Asp355-Pro357 segment is to stabilize the inhibitory
          conformation of PAI-1.
        
        
          Specific activity, functional stability and complex
          formation of Glu351Ala and Glu351Arg
          The specific inhibitory activities of wtPAI-1,
          Glu351Ala and Glu351Arg were assessed with uPA and
          S-2444. As shown in Fg. 4A, the specificity of wtPAI-1,
          Glu351Ala and Glu351Arg after denatured by 6 M Gdn-HCl
          and dialyzed against 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6, was 84
          ± 15, 112 ± 18 and 68 ± 9 U/ug, respectively. Glu351Ala
          had a higher, and Glu351Arg lower specific activity than
          wtPAI-1. The specific activities of PAI-1s determined
          immediately after purification displayed similar pattern
          as that of inhibitors reactivated. There was about 15-20%
          increase after reactivation compared to each untreated
          protein itself. As shown in Fig. 4B, the two mutants also
          spontaneously lost their inhibitory activity(convert to
          latency) as wtPAI-1, but at different rates. The
          functional stability of wtPAI-1, Glu351Ala, Glu351Arg was
          about 18 ± 5, 90 ± 8 and 14 ± 3 minutes, respectively. It
          suggested that the specific activities measured above, to
          some extent, proportionally represent the functional
          stability. More importantly, amount complexes formed by
          tPA and PAI-1s remained after incubation at 37°C (Fig.
          4C) were proportionally concordant with the results
          obtained from enzymatic stability assay (Fig. 4B). This
          proves that results from enzymatic assay are valid. The
          result of functional stability suggests that Glu351 is
          indeed involved in the conformational transition of
          PAI-1.
        
        
          Inhibition of thrombin by PAI-1s and Neutralization
          of PAI-1s by Thrombin
          Both mutants inhibited thrombin more efficiently than
          wtPAI-1, more importantly, Glu351Ala was better than
          Glu351Arg in inhibiting thrombin (Fig. 5A); Inhibition of
          thrombin by Glu351Arg was almost as same as by Glu351Ala
          in presence of vitronectin (Fig. 5B), which facilitated
          the thrombin inhibition by both mutants. When excess
          equal amount of thrombin was incubated with equal amount
          of PAI-1s in term of inhibitory activity against uPA,
          mutant inhibitors were neutralized faster by thrombin
          than wtPAI-1, and vitronectin also facilitated the
          neutralization of Glu351Ala or Glu351Arg by thrombin,
          just similar to the wtPAI-1 (Fig. 5C).
        
        
          Inhibition of plasmin by PAI-1s
          When plasmin was incubated with increased amount of
          equal active PAI-1s in absence or in presence of
          vitronectin, it was inhibited faster by mutants than by
          wtPAI-1 (Fig. 6upper panel); and both of mutant also
          displayed improved inhibition toward plasmin in presence
          of vitronectin (Fig. 6lower panel).
        
        
          Kinetic analysis
          The rate constants of tPA for wtPAI-1, Glu351Ala and
          Glu351Arg were similar (Table 4), however, The rate
          constants of inhibition toward uPA by Glu351Ala and
          Glu351Arg were 4 and 7-fold higher than by wtPAI-1,
          respectively. Moreover, The rate constants of Glu351Ala
          and Glu351Arg for thrombin inhibition were 2 to 4 folds
          higher than that of wtPAI-1 and rate constants of
          Glu351Ala and Glu351Arg to plasmin were 2 fold higher
          than that of wtPAI-1. This indicates that Glu351 is not
          essential for the interaction with tPA, but it is an very
          important determinant for the optimal interaction with
          uPA, thrombin and plasmin.
        
      
      
        Disscusion
        
          Cognate protease specificity
          Improvements in specificity of mutants for uPA
          indicates that Glu351 involve in the interaction with
          uPA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
          that the specificity of PAI-1 toward uPA is partially
          mediated by the negatively charged residue located in the
          C-terminal of cleavage site in PAI-1. The interaction of
          Glu351 with uPA is much more important than that of
          Glu351 with tPA, which is demonstrated by improved
          reactivity of Glu351 mutants toward uPA, but not toward
          tPA, showing that tPA is not directly interact with
          Glu351 of PAI-1, whereas Glu351 is necessary for the
          optimal interaction with uPA. Our results are concordant
          with previous study, [ 25 ] which suggests that serpin
          body-protease body interactions play significant roles in
          determining serpin inhibitory activity against target
          proteases.
        
        
          Non-cognate protease
          Substitution of Glu351 also altered the specificity
          toward non-cognate proteases: plasmin and thrombin. Glu
          at 351 may provide steric hindrance that slows the rate
          of thrombin or plasmin inhibition. Mutations at Glu351
          may decrease the original repulsive interactions with
          variable region of thrombin, which may slow the rate of
          thrombin inhibition, or results in favorable interactions
          that may not exist when wtPAI-1 react with thrombin. So,
          both Glu351Arg and Glu351Arg are better thrombin
          inhibitors than wtPAI-1. Similar results were observed
          for plasmin. With single mutation at position Glu351, we
          improved reactivity of PAI-1 to thrombin and plasmin
          without significantly affecting its specificity to tPA.
          This substantiates previous mutagenesis studies, which
          demonstrated that repulsive interactions and/or lack of
          productive electrostatic interactions between Glu39 and
          Glu192 of thrombin and PAI-1 are responsible for the slow
          reaction of thrombin with this serpin. [ 26 ]
          Furthermore, the rapid inhibition of plasmin requires a
          non-covalent interaction between an amino-terminal site
          of plasmin and a carboxyl-terminal on anti-plasmin, and a
          second site outside the RCL of PAI-1 contributes to its
          specific interaction with proteases. [ 15 27 ] The
          specificity of the two mutants toward thrombin and
          plasmin implicates that Glu351 of PAI-1 is involved in
          its specificity toward thrombin and plasmin.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        Single site mutations within the segment
        Asp355-Arg356-Pro357 of PAI-1 yield Gdn-HCl activatable
        inhibitors that can still form SDS stable complexes with
        plasminogen activators, with second order inhibition
        constants that are similar to the native inhibitor.
        Interestingly, the conversion of these mutants to latent
        forms was ~3-4 fold faster than wtPAI-1, suggesting that
        the Asp355-Pro357 segment is involved in maintaining the
        inhibitory conformation of PAI-1. Glu351 contributes to the
        optimal functional stability of PAI-1 and participates its
        conformational stability. More importantly, Glu351 of PAI-1
        is a specificity determinant for uPA, thrombin and plasmin,
        but not for tPA.
      
      
        Methods
        
          General DNA techniques
          Plasmid DNA was purified using either Promega or
          QIAGEN miniprep kits. The DNA was sequenced using the
          di-deoxy chain termination reaction method using an ABI
          373 DNA sequencer. Oligonucleotides were synthesized
          using a 380 B DNA synthesizer (ABI model). DNA
          manipulation techniques were carried out according to
          standard procedures [ 29 ] .
        
        
          Construction of wtPAI-1 and its mutants
          The pPAI-1-AI was digested with EcoRI and BglII to
          release a 1426 basepair (bp) PAI-1 coding sequence, which
          was isolated, purified, and ligated into EcoRI and BglII
          digested pVL1393. The resultant pVL1393-PAI-1 was
          analyzed by restriction mapping and sequencing. The
          mutants at E351A, E351R, D355, R356, and P357 of PAI-1
          were generated by PCR. The occurrence of the resulting
          mutations D355A, D355E, D355H, D355K, D355N, D355P,
          D355Q, R356P, P357G as well as E351A and E351R in pRSET
          was confirmed by sequencing. The PAI-1 sequence
          containing the desired mutations was digested with EcoR1
          and BglII, and then subcloned into pVL1393. The
          recombinant baculoviruses containing either wtPAI-1, or
          one of the above mutants was obtained as deccribed by
          Kjoller et al. [ 30 ]
        
        
          Expression and purification of wtPAI-1 and its
          mutants
          High 5 cells, grown at 27°C in SF-900 serum-free
          medium, were infected with high-titer virus stocks (1-3 ×
          10 8/ml). The medium was collected 48 hrs after the
          infection (found to be the optimal harvesting time for
          wtPAI-1) and then centrifuged for 5 minutes (125 × g).
          The supernatents (50 ml) were collected and sodium
          chloride (final concentration 0.25 M) was added. They
          were then applied on a heparin-Sepharose column (bed
          volume 5 ml) that was equilibrated and run (flow rate 20
          ml/h) with a buffer consisted of 50 mM sodium acetate, pH
          5.6, containing 0.25 M NaCl and 0.01% Tween-20. The
          columns were washed and the PAI-1s were eluted with a 40
          ml gradient of 0.25 - 1 M NaCl in the same buffer.
        
        
          SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting and deglycosylation of
          PAI-1
          The medium of the infected cells and the elutent from
          heparin-Sepharose were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and
          monitored by silver staining. Fibrosarcoma PAI-1 and
          wtPAI-1 were transferred onto nitrocellulose paper and
          the proteins were revealed with anti-human PAI-1
          monoclonal antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase
          (HRP) conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody, and enhanced
          chemiluminescence (ECL). 5 ug of Fibrosarcoma PAI-1, or
          wtPAI-1 was denatured by boiling for 5 min in a buffer
          consisted of 0.5% SDS, 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 50 mM
          Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. They were then digested (18 hr, at
          37°C) with 0.5 units of recombinant N-glycanase in the
          presence of 2.5% NP-40, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and
          silver staining. Protein concentrations were determined
          by the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent.
        
        
          Functional stability of fibrosarcoma PAI-1, wtPAI-1
          and its mutants
          The inhibitory activities of fibrosarcoma PAI-1,
          wtPAI-1, and its mutants were measured by a direct
          chromogenic assay using uPA (100 U/ug) and its substrate
          S-2444 in a microtiter plate as described earlier [ 20 ]
          . Briefly, fibrosarcoma PAI-1, wtPAI-1, or its mutants
          were diluted 1:10 in the activity measuring assay buffer
          (50 uM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl and 100
          ug/ml BSA). The PAI-1 samples were incubated in the
          absence or in the presence of a two molar excess of
          vitronectin (the fibrosarcoma PAI-1 and the wtPAI-1 were
          incubated with vitronectin) at 37°C. At the times
          indicated, aliquots were removed and analyzed immediately
          for their inhibitory activity. One unit of PAI-1 activity
          is defined as the amount that completely neutralizes 1 U
          of uPA. The specific activity obtained at time zero was
          assigned a value of 100%.
        
        
          Activation of PAI-1 and kinetic analysis
          Fibrosarcoma PAI-1, wtPAI-1 or its mutants were
          denatured with 6 M guanidine-hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) (45
          min at 37°C), followed by dialysis (4-16 hours at 4°C)
          against 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6, containing 0.5 M
          NaCl and 0.01% Tween-20. This process which PAI-1
          regained its activity is called activation by Gdn-HCl.
          The inhibitory activity of each of the PAI-1s was assayed
          immediately. The second-order rate constants for the
          interaction of the fibrosarcoma PAI-1, wtPAI-1 or the
          indicated mutants with single-chain tPA or uPA were
          determined in a single-step assay as previously
          described. [ 20 ]
        
        
          Specific activity, functional stability and complex
          formation of PAI-1s
          The inhibitory activities of wtPAI-1 and mutants were
          measured by a direct chromogenic assay using uPA (100
          U/μg) and substrate S-2444. [ 17 ] Briefly, serially
          diluted wtPAI-1, or mutants were incubated with equal
          volume of uPA (50 μl, 50 U/ml) for 30 min at 37°C,
          followed by addition of 100 μl, 0.5 mM S-2444. Residual
          uPA activity was quantitated by measuring the change in
          absorbance at 405 nm with ELISA reader. The specific
          activity of PAI-1 was calculated based on the amount of
          uPA inhibited by PAI-1. The assay for PAI-1 inhibitory
          activity toward two-chain tPA was the same for uPA except
          that the samples were incubated with tPA and S-2288.
          PAI-1 inhibitory activity is expressed as the number of
          international units of PAs inhibited by PAI-1. Specific
          activity of uPA and two-chain tPA are 100 U/μg and 764
          U/μg, respectively. For the functional stability,
          wtPAI-1, or mutants were incubated at 37°C. Aliquots were
          taken out at times indicated and analyzed immediately as
          described above. The specific activity obtained at time
          zero was assigned a value of 100%. To provide the
          evidence to support the conclusion obtained from enzyme
          assay, certain amount of wtPAI-1, E351R and E351A were
          incubated with equal amount of tPA at 37°C for 30 minutes
          before put on ice, at same time these PAI-1s were
          incubated in PBS at 37°C for 3 hours, respectively,
          before the PAI-1s were incubated with same amount of tPA
          at 37°C for 30 minutes, then the protein samples prepared
          at two time points were subjected to SDS-PAGE and western
          blot as described before.
        
        
          Inhibition of thrombin and plasmin by PAI-1s
          Thrombin (0.025 U), or plasmin (0.1 μg/ml) was
          incubated at 37°C for 30 min with same amount of wtPAI-1,
          E351A and E351R in term of inhibitory activity toward uPA
          (20 U in the concentration range of 4-10 μg/ml) in
          absence or presence of vitronectin (60 μg/ml). Linear
          increase of absorbance at 405 nm were recorded after
          adding S-2238 (final concentration 0.25 mM) for thrombin,
          or N-p-Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-Nitroanilide (final
          concentration 0.5 mM) for plasmin. Thrombin, or plasmin
          activity without PAI-1 was taken as 100%.
        
        
          Neutralization of PAI-1s by Thrombin
          wtPAI-1 and mutants were incubated with four molar
          excess of thrombin (40 nM) in the absence or presence of
          vitronectin (30 nM). Control experiments were carried out
          in the absence of thrombin. After 20 min at 37°C, the
          activity of thrombin was quenched by the addition of
          hirudin (final concentration, 60 units /ml), resulting in
          inhibition of more than 95% of the amidolytic activity of
          thrombin. Subsequently, the residual PAI-1 inhibitory
          activity was determined by titration of aliquots on uPA,
          using S2444 as substrate. The increase of the optical
          density at 405 nm in the samples was corrected for the
          values measured with (hirudin-inactivated) thrombin
          alone, since the amidolytic activity of thrombin on S2444
          was not completely blocked by hirudin,
        
        
          Complex formation of PAI-1s with tPA or uPA
          Complex formation of the fibrosarcoma PAI-1, wtPAI-1
          or its mutants with single-chain tPA or uPA were
          performed as described earlier [ 20 ] . Samples of PAI-1s
          (5 U) were incubated in the absence or in the presence of
          a 2-fold excess of uPA or tPA in the activity assay
          buffer. Following a 30 min incubation at room
          temperature, the samples were subjected to a 10% SDS-PAGE
          and immunoblotting as described above.
