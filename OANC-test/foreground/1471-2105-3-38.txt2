          Model of an oscillating biochemical network
          In [ 8 ] , Laub and Loomis propose a model of the
          molecular network underlying adenosine 3',5'-cyclic
          monophosphate (cAMP) oscillations observed in fields of
          chemotactic 
          Dictyostelium discoideum cells. The
          model, based on the network depicted in Fig. 1, induces
          the spontaneous oscillations in cAMP observed during the
          early development of 
          D. discoideum. 
          In this model, changes in the enzymatic activities of
          these proteins are described by a system of seven
          non-linear differential equations:
          
          where the state variable 
          x = [ 
          x 
          1 ,..., 
          x 
          7 ] represents the concentrations of
          the seven proteins: 
          x 
          1 = [ACA], 
          x 
          2 = [PKA], 
          x 
          3 = [ERK2], 
          x 
          4 = [REG A], 
          x 
          5 = [Internal cAMP], 
          x 
          6 = [External cAMP] and 
          x 
          7 = [CAR1] and the fourteen different 
          k 
          
            i 
           represent system parameter values. It was shown
          numerically in [ 8 ] that spontaneous oscillations appear
          at the nominal parameter values found in Table 1. Note
          that because there are typographical errors in the
          original paper, the values being used here for the
          nominal parameters were obtained directly from the
          authors of [ 8 ] .
          This particular model is primarily concerned with
          describing self-sustaining oscillations in the
          biochemical system. From Fig. 2, it is clear that at the
          nominal parameter values of the model, this is achieved.
          We seek to determine whether the system is robust - that
          is, if we change these kinetic parameters, will the
          systems oscillatory behaviour persist? We next present
          two possible means, based on whether parameters are
          changed one at a time or in groups.
        
      
      
        Methods
        
          Single parameter robustness: Bifurcation
          analysis
          Self-sustained oscillations such as those being
          modelled here appear as stable limit cycles in trajectory
          of the underlying dynamical system [ 11 ] . The existence
          and stability of these limit cycles may change under
          parametric perturbations. Whenever a stable periodic
          solution loses stability as we vary the underlying
          parameters of the system and this solution transitions to
          another qualitative solution - for example, a
          steady-state equilibrium - we say that the system
          undergoes a 
          Hopf bifurcation. It is therefore
          possible to use bifurcation theory as a means of
          quantifying the robustness of this oscillatory network
          model [ 12 13 ] .
          Using the bifurcation analysis package AUTO [ 14 ] ,
          it is possible to produce one-parameter bifurcation
          diagrams for each of the model parameters 
          k 
          
            i 
           . These diagrams illustrate the steady-state
          behaviour of the systems as the parameter values are
          changed. Suppose that Hopf bifurcations occur at 
          
            k 
           
          
            i 
           and 
          
            i 
           so that (stable) limit cycles occur for the range ( 
          
            k 
            
              i 
             
           , 
          
            i 
           ). Both the size of this interval as well as the
          proximity of the nominal parameter value to either
          boundary are measures of the robustness of the system. To
          compare the robustness of the system to the different
          parameters, we can define a series of parametric
          robustness measures. We define the 
          degree of robustness (DOR) for each
          parameter 
          k 
          
            i 
           as:
          
          It is straightforward to see that this value is always
          between zero and one. The former indicates extreme
          parameter sensitivity whereas the latter implies large
          insensitivity.
          Bifurcation diagrams provide an excellent means of
          determining the robustness of systems to single parameter
          perturbations. We next describe a method for analysing
          and quantifying robustness to simultaneous changes in
          several parameters.

          values
          
            Determining the limit cycle: Harmonic balance
            method
            The first step is to obtain a mathematical
            expression for the limit cycle oscillation. The
            harmonic balance method can be used [ 17 ] . The basic
            idea is to represent the limit cycle by a Fourier
            series with unknown coefficients ( 
            a 
            
            n , 
            i  , φ 
            
            n , 
            i  ) and period 
            T :
            
            The non-linear differential equation can be used to
            set up a series of algebraic equations that the
            coefficients must satisfy. These equations can be
            solved using numerical packages such as Mathematica or
            Maple. Depending on the particular form of the limit
            cycle, a small finite number of coefficients can be
            used. We can denote this periodic solution as 
            x *( 
            t ).
          
          
            Linearization
            The non-linear differential equation must now be
            linearized about this periodic orbit [ 17 ] . Writing
            the state vector 
            x ( 
            t ) as
            
            x ( 
            t ) = 
            x *( 
            t ) + 
            x 
            δ ( 
            t )
            then the local behaviour of the non-linear system is
            governed by that of the linearized system:
            
            δ ( 
            t ) ≅ 
            J ( 
            x *( 
            t )) 
            x 
            ≈ ( 
            t )
            where 
            J is the Jacobian matrix of the
            vector field 
            f . Note that since the
            linearization is performed about a periodic orbit, the
            linear system is periodic.
          
          
            Restructuring into nominal/uncertainty
            systems
            The Jacobian matrix includes all uncertain
            parameters. At this point we need to separate the
            system into a nominal model and a feedback
            interconnection that involves all parametric
            uncertainty. We first write each parameter as
            
            where 
            k 
            
              i 
             is the nominal value and δ 
            
              i 
             is the relative amount of perturbation in the 
            i thparameter. We now separate
            the Jacobian matrix as
            
            J ( 
            x *( 
            t )) = 
            A 
            0 ( 
            t ) + 
            B 
            0 ( 
            t ) Δ 
            C 
            0 ( 
            t ) (4)
            where 
            A 
            0 ( 
            t ) is the Jacobian matrix with
            all parameters at their nominal value, and Δ is a
            diagonal matrix containing all the uncertainties δ 
            
              i 
             . Let 
            y ( 
            t ) = 
            C 
            0 ( 
            t ) 
            x 
            δ ( 
            t ) and 
            u ( 
            t ) = Δ 
            y ( 
            t ), the system is now of the
            form of Eqn. (2) (with 
            x ( 
            t ) replaced by 
            x 
            δ ( 
            t )).
          
          
            Discretization
            The system can be discretized by sampling the state
            and output with sampling period 
            h = 
            T/n , where 
            n is a positive integer and
            assuming that the inputs are piecewise constant; this
            is also a standard technique in control engineering [
            18 ] . In particular, a linear continuous-time system
            governed by Eqn. (2) gives rise to the discrete-time,
            linear system
            ξ ( 
            k + 1) = 
            A 
            
              d 
             ( 
            k ) ξ( 
            k ) + 
            B 
            
              d 
             ( 
            k ) 
            v ( 
            k )
            η ( 
            k ) = 
            C 
            
              d 
             ( 
            k ) ξ( 
            k )
            where 
            A 
            
              d 
             ( 
            k ) = Φ ( 
            kh + 
            h , 
            kh ), 
            B 
            
              d 
             ( 
            k ) = Φ ( 
            kh + 
            h , 
            s ) 
            B 
            0 ( 
            s ) 
            ds , 
            C 
            
              d 
             ( 
            k ) = 
            C 
            0 ( 
            kh ), and Φ ( 
            t , τ) is the transition matrix
            of 
            A 
            0 ( 
            t ) [ 19 ] . The discretized
            signals are 
            v ( 
            k ) = 
            u ( 
            kh ), η( 
            k ) = 
            y ( 
            kh ), and ξ( 
            k ) = 
            x ( 
            kh ). Periodicity of 
            A 
            
              d 
             and 
            B 
            
              d 
             is preserved due to the periodicity of the
            transition matrix. Moreover, it is not difficult to
            confirm that 
            A 
            
              d 
             , 
            B 
            
              d 
             and 
            C 
            
              d 
             are periodic with period 
            n . The uncertainty matrix after
            discretization is now Δ 
            
              d 
             . The discretization step is illustrated in Fig.
            4A.
          
          
            Lifting
            The final step in preparing the system for SSV
            analysis is to transform the periodic, linearized
            system into an equivalent time-invariant one. The
            technique for this is known as 
            lifting [ 18 ] . Rather than
            giving the general formulae, it is easier to illustrate
            the general principle with an example.
            Suppose that a discrete-time system with state
            variable ξ, input 
            v , and output η obeys the
            difference equation
            ξ ( 
            k + 1) = 
            a ( 
            k )ξ( 
            k ) + 
            b ( 
            k ) 
            v ( 
            k )
            η ( 
            k ) = 
            c ( 
            k )ξ( 
            k )
            where the time varying coefficients 
            a ( 
            k ), 
            b ( 
            k ) and 
            c ( 
            k ) are all periodic with period
            two. Calculating the state variable and output
            step-by-step leads to:
            
            for any integer 
            p . By defining "lifted" inputs
            and outputs
            
            and considering the system state only at the even
            time points ( ( 
            p ) = ξ(2 
            p )) we arrive at an equivalent
            time-invariant system.
            The lifting technique has been illustrated above for
            a discrete-time system with period two; however, it can
            be applied to systems with arbitrary period - though
            the corresponding formulae are considerably more
            complicated; see [ 18 ] .
          
          
            Computation of SSV
            There is considerable literature in control theory
            on the computation of the SSV; see for example [ 20 21
            22 ] . For general classes of uncertainty, computing μ 
            Δ is known to be NP-hard [ 21 ] .
            Typically, given the feedback loop consisting of 
            G and Δ we compute upper and
            lower bounds for the SSV [ 15 ] . The lower bound is
            exactly equal to μ 
            Δ [ 15 ] ; unfortunately computing
            this lower bound involves a search over a non-convex
            set and therefore may converge to local optimums that
            are not global. In contrast, the upper bound can be
            rewritten in terms of a convex optimisation problem, so
            that a global minimum can be obtained. However, this
            upper bound is, in general not tight. A software
            package is commercially available that can compute μ 
            upper and uses a power algorithm
            to attempt to compute μ 
            lower [ 22 ] .
          
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Single parameter robustness
          The robustness of Laub and Loomis's oscillatory model
          was first analysed by means of single-parameter
          bifurcation diagrams. Four typical diagrams are shown in
          Fig. 5. The activity of internal cAMP ( 
          x 
          5 ) is plotted as a function of the
          variation of each parameter. We use internal cAMP in the
          diagram as it is the element that is usually observed
          experimentally [ 23 ] . In each of the diagrams, there
          are three types of solutions: stable steady state,
          unstable steady state and limit cycle oscillations.
          These diagrams illustrate that Hopf bifurcations occur
          for each parameter; that is, the oscillatory behaviour
          exists only in a limited range of parameters around the
          nominal value. For each of these parameters, the
          respective intervals and values for degree-of-robustness
          are found in Table 1.
        
        
          Structural singular value
          From the numerical simulation (Fig. 2) of the
          non-linear model, we observed that the oscillatory curves
          did not deviate greatly from a simple harmonic oscillator
          plus a constant offset. Thus, to obtain an analytic
          expression for the periodic orbits we assume that the
          state variables are expanded into Fourier series
          containing only the fundamental and constant terms:
          
          for each of the seven states. Since it is the relative
          phase shift between each state variable that is relevant,
          we assume that θ 
          1 = 0. The substitution of the Fourier
          series into the original equations leads to a series of
          real algebraic equations for the coefficients (not shown)
          whose solution was obtained using Mathematica. This leads
          us to obtain the corresponding periodic solutions where
          the values of 
          A 
          0, 
          i  , 
          A 
          1, 
          i  and θ 
          
            i 
           are found in Table 2. The period 
          T is approximately 7.31 minutes.
          This analytic solution matches well with the numerical
          simulation except for an arbitrary phase shift, which
          does not affect the shape and location of the limit cycle
          in the phase space and can thereby be ignored (not
          shown).
          Following our prescribed methods, we next linearized
          the system. The Jacobian matrix is obtained and was
          decomposed as in Eqn. (4) to obtain:
          
          The matrix 
          B 
          0 ( 
          t ) = { 
          B 
          
          i , 
          j  } where
          
          Similarly, the matrix 
          C 
          0 ( 
          t ) = { 
          C 
          
          i , 
          j  } where all coefficients are
          zero except for the following:
          
          Finally, 
          D 
          0 = 0 and the perturbation structure
          is given by
          Δ = diag {δ 
          1 ,δ 
          2 ,δ 
          2 ,δ 
          3 ,δ 
          4 ,δ 
          5 ,δ 
          6 ,δ 
          6 ,δ 
          8 ,δ 
          8 ,δ 
          9 ,δ 
          10 ,δ 
          10 ,δ 
          11 ,δ 
          12 ,δ 
          13 ,δ 
          14 }
          Note that since the nominal trajectory is periodic,
          the matrix functions in the nominal description are also
          periodic. Note also that in the uncertainty matrix, Δ,
          some uncertainties are repeated (δ 
          2 ,δ 
          6 ,δ 
          8 and δ 
          10 ) while δ 
          7 is missing.
          The system was then discretized and lifted following
          the procedure outlined above. A comparison of the system
          response for each of the approximations at the nominal
          parameter values is given in Fig. 4B.
          For the sampling time we tried various values of 
          n but found negligible differences
          for values above eight. Finally, we computed the bounds
          on the SSV. Once again, we found that the values of these
          two bounds were not affected much by the sampling
          frequency provided that 
          n is greater than eight. The upper
          bound was successfully computed using [ 22 ] . The
          maximum over all frequencies is approximately 12.06.
          However, the high dimension of system causes convergence
          problem during the computation of μ 
          lower using this package. To obtain
          an acceptable lower bound, we calculate the spectral
          radius at each frequency. This gives us a lower bound for
          μ 
          lower . The plot of the bounds for
          the SSV when 
          n = 16 is shown in Fig. 6. We can
          use μ 
          lower to obtain a conservative
          region for robust stability. The highest value over all
          frequencies for μ 
          lower is approximately 2.636.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Recent years has seen an appreciation that key cellular
        properties are robust to variations in individual parameter
        values. Based on the topology of many of these networks,
        this should not be surprising. Feedback - both negative and
        positive - control systems are ubiquitous in most
        biological networks [ 24 ] and one of the reasons for using
        feedback is that it reduces sensitivity of a system's
        behaviour to its parameter values.
        In modelling biological networks, it is important that
        this robustness also be in evidence. The particular
        behaviour being characterized by the model should not rely
        on precise values of the model's parameters - for example,
        reaction rate constants or protein concentrations. In
        particular, a precise measurement of these constants is
        difficult whereas protein concentrations will vary from one
        cell to another or throughout the lifetime of any
        individual. Deviations from the nominal model parameter
        values should not result in a loss of the network's
        performance; thus, parameter sensitivity can be used to
        validate mathematical models of biochemical system. That
        is, the more insensitive the system response is to the
        accuracy of the parameter, the more faith we should have in
        the model [ 25 ] .
        In looking at certain classes of behaviour, where
        qualitative changes in the stability of the system are
        possible, bifurcation diagrams provide an elegant means of
        evaluating robustness. For example, in evaluating the
        robustness of the model of Laub and Loomis, of primary
        importance is determining whether the oscillatory behaviour
        will persist if the parameter values are altered. This
        qualitative difference in performance - from limit cycle
        oscillations to constant steady states - can be quantified
        and compared across parameters or from one model to
        another. Once the robustness of the oscillatory behaviour
        is established, further investigations of the robustness of
        some of the oscillatory features, for example frequency and
        amplitude can further be evaluated.
        From the bifurcation diagrams obtained for each of the
        fourteen parameters, we know that oscillations exist only
        in a limited range around the nominal value. We find the
        system to be quite sensitive to variations in 
        k 
        2 , 
        k 
        4 , 
        k 
        10 and 
        k 
        14 and mostly insensitive to the others.
        Single-parameter bifurcation analysis also shows that the
        amplitude of the oscillation is greatly affected by the
        variation of 9 parameters ( 
        k 
        1 , 
        k 
        2 , 
        k 
        4 , 
        k 
        6 , 
        k 
        7 , 
        k 
        10 , 
        k 
        11 , 
        k 
        12 , and 
        k 
        14 ).
        Based on the SSV stability to interpret multiple
        parameter sensitivity, we can conclude that robust
        stability of the periodic orbits will be maintained,
        provided that
        
        Since the uncertainty matrix consists only of diagonal
        entries, this bound applies to each of the individual
        parameters. Thus, we can guarantee that the system will be
        robustly stable provided that no single parameter differs
        more than 8.3% from its nominal value.
        In our analysis we found a large gap between μ 
        upper and our lower bound for μ. As
        we later show, for this system the upper bound is fairly
        tight, as we are able to obtain a destabilizing
        perturbation of size 9%. For general biological models, a
        robustness measure based on the upper bound μ 
        upper may also be more appropriate.
        Robustness bounds for systems in which arbitrarily
        slowly-time-varying parameter values are allowed are known
        [ 26 ] . For these systems it has been shown that the
        bounds converge as the time-variations approach zero to the
        upper bound μ 
        upper [ 26 ] . Since many of the
        parameters in models of biochemical networks represent
        features that will vary over time, such as enzyme
        concentrations, this number may therefore be more
        indicative of the model's true robustness.
        The ability to consider the effect of time-variations on
        the robustness of the system is one great advantage of the
        SSV over other methodologies. One drawback of the SSV
        approach compared to the bifurcation theory is that it does
        not provide the precise combination of parameters that
        destabilizes the system - only its size. Also, since the
        upper bound is only sufficient to guarantee robustness,
        this number may, in general, give an overly conservative
        notion of robustness.
        It must be emphasized that the SSV approach denoted here
        is based on the linearized model of the system. For some
        classes of systems this linearization may not be possible -
        in this case, the linear SSV approach documented here will
        not be applicable. However, for most models used to
        describe biochemical reactions, this should not be a
        problem.
        Because we are concentrating exclusively on the local
        stability of the linearized model, important parameters of
        the oscillatory behaviour such as robustness of the
        frequency and amplitudes of oscillation are not evaluated.
        Also, the effect of parameter variations on the equilibrium
        orbit are omitted. In particular, varying the kinetic
        parameters will change the behaviour of the system in two
        different ways: the equilibrium periodic orbit will change
        and the stability of deviations about this orbit will also
        change. The SSV allows one to quantify the robustness of
        the second of these two effects. It does not say anything
        directly regarding the effect of parameter variations on
        the equilibrium periodic orbit. One way of bounding the
        effect of these parameter changes is to write the original
        differential equation as
        ( 
        t ) = 
        f ( 
        x , 
        k )
        where 
        k = 
        k 
        0 + δ is the set of kinetic parameters
        with nominal values 
        k 
        0 . If the nominal periodic orbit (when
        δ = 0) is given by
        
        x *( 
        t ) = 
        x ( 
        t ) - 
        x 
        δ ( 
        t )
        then, linearizing about this orbit yields
        
        δ ( 
        t ) = 
        A ( 
        t ) 
        x 
        δ ( 
        t ) + 
        v 
        where δ is a constant vector that includes the effect of
        this parametric uncertainty. Thus, the system can be
        considered as being perturbed by a constant input signal 
        v . Provided that the homogeneous
        system is exponentially stable (and this is guaranteed by
        the existence of a stable limit cycle) and that 
        v is not "too large", the perturbed
        system's state will remain in a neighbourhood of the origin
        if the 
        f ( 
        x , 
        p ) in the original equation is
        reasonably well behaved in 
        k . Detailed bounds and conditions on
        
        f are given in Theorem 5.1 of [ 17 ]
        , though it should be emphasized that these bounds tend to
        be overly conservative in practice.
        To illustrate the local nature of the SSV analysis for
        this system, we perturbed the system parameters by varying
        amounts. The particular parameters were either increased or
        decreased so as to bring them closer to the Hopf
        bifurcation. For example, the nominal value of 
        k 
        1 is closer to 
        
          k 
         
        1 than to 
        1 so that we reduced 
        k 
        1 whereas 
        k 
        4 is closer to 
        4 than to 
        
          k 
         
        4 so we increased 
        k 
        4 . In Fig. 7we show the response of
        these systems to changes of 7% and 9% both for the
        linearized system - where the linearized response has been
        superimposed on the nominal limit cycle (Fig. 7A) and the
        original non-linear system (Fig. 7B). For the smaller
        value, the linearized response is stable and we see that,
        after a transient, the response settles to the nominal
        limit cycle. We also see this same behaviour in the
        response of the non-linear system with this level of
        parameter perturbation. For a 9% change in the parameters,
        however, the linearized system is unstable. We see this as
        a deviation from the nominal limit cycle. In the non-linear
        system's response, this translates into an end to the
        stable limit cycle. The response does not "blow up" but
        instead settles into a fixed point.
        This example illustrates how a robustness analysis of
        the linearized system can be used to deduce the robustness
        of the original non-linear system, as it shows that when
        the linearized system is unstable, the desired behaviour of
        the non-linear system will no longer be present. This
        example also points out the fact that the upper bound μ 
        upper ≅ 8.3% is not overly
        conservative for this system as we were able to produce a
        destabilizing perturbation of size 9%.
        Finally, we note that multiparametric robustness
        analysis considered here is based on local properties of
        the dynamical system, since we are evaluating the
        robustness of the linearized model. Extensions to the
        non-linear model are the subject of active investigation [
        27 ] .
        However, it is by combining the robustness analysis of
        both single and multiple parameters, we can obtain a more
        thorough understanding of the region of stability of the
        periodic solution in the high dimensional parameter space
        and use this to improve upon the model. In this particular
        example, we find that the system's robustness is governed
        by several "robustness limiting" parameters, 
        k 
        2 , 
        k 
        4 , 
        k 
        10 and 
        k 
        14 .
      
      
        Conclusions
        Determining the robustness of mathematical models of
        biological systems is important for several reasons. First,
        there is growing evidence that many aspects of the networks
        being modelled have evolved in such a way so that they are
        robust as this allows them to tolerate natural variations
        in the environment. Thus, faithful models should replicate
        this robustness. Second, robustness of the models provide a
        means of validating model quality since the performance of
        the models should not rely on precisely tuned parameter
        values that are impossible - or at best - difficult to
        measure exactly.
        In this paper, we illustrated the use of two tools
        developed in dynamical systems theory and control
        engineering to assess robustness quantitatively. For an
        example, we considered an oscillatory molecular network
        model due to Laub and Loomis that aims at describing
        oscillatory behaviour in cAMP signalling observed in the
        social amoeba 
        D. discoideum. This behaviour appears
        as a stable limit cycle of the equations describing the
        model. We have evaluated the degree to which this limit
        cycle is robust to variations in all the system
        parameters.
        The robustness of the oscillatory behaviour to single
        parameter variations was quantified using bifurcation
        analysis. Using the bifurcation analysis software tool AUTO
        we determined that single parameter changes as small as 20%
        from the nominal value can cause the limit cycle to
        disappear and a stable equilibrium to appear. In addition
        to the stability robustness, AUTO is also able to evaluate
        the sensitivity of the amplitude of the oscillation to
        these parameter changes.
        To investigate the robustness of the model to
        simultaneous changes in parameter values, the structured
        singular value (SSV) analysis tool was used. Once the
        system was in the correct framework for SSV analysis, we
        were able to determine that the system can only tolerate
        very small changes in the parameter values - in the order
        of 8% - if we allow these parameters to vary with time
        arbitrarily slowly.
        Finally, it is important to note that to understand
        completely the robustness properties of a model, it is
        appropriate to combine single and multiple parameter
        sensitivity analyses.
