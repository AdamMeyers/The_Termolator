        Differentiation is commonly associated with intermingled
        changes in gene expression and cellular proliferation. In
        some differentiating cell types, changes in both gene
        transcription and proliferation are regulated by the same
        transcription factor [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ] . CCAAT/Enhancer
        Binding Protein alpha (C/EBPα) is a transcription factor
        that is required for the differentiation of a number of
        tissues [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ] . Mice homozygous
        for C/EBPα null alleles have severe defects in tissues
        involved in metabolic homeostasis [ 19 20 21 ] . Cellular
        proliferation is elevated in the liver of these knockout
        mice [ 22 ] suggesting that C/EBPα blocks proliferation 
        in vivo. In cultured cells, C/EBPα
        expression leads to decreased colony formation upon
        antibiotic selection [ 23 24 25 ] , decreased DNA synthesis
        [ 22 24 25 26 27 ] and an enhanced proportion of cells in
        the G1 phase of the cell cycle [ 26 ] . Thus, C/EBPα
        regulates cellular proliferation, as well as gene
        transcription.
        C/EBPα contains a bZIP domain conserved at the carboxy
        terminus of a number of transcription factors [ 12 28 ] .
        The bZIP domain consists of a basic region that binds
        directly to DNA, followed immediately by a leucine zipper.
        C/EBPα dimerizes via the leucine zipper. This dimerization
        is required for DNA binding [ 28 29 ] . At least three
        transcription activation functions have been described in
        the more amino terminal regions of C/EBPα [ 30 31 32 ] .
        C/EBPα domains and activities associated with proliferation
        arrest also have been identified, but vary considerably
        between studies [ 23 25 33 34 35 36 ] .
        C/EBPα binds to and activates transcription of the gene
        promoter for the p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase
        (CDK) [ 37 ] . This led to speculation that p21 gene
        activation may contribute to cell cycle arrest by C/EBPα [
        37 ] . Similarly, suppression of mitotic growth during
        adipocyte differentiation was associated with C/EBPα
        activation of the promoters of gadd45 (growth arrest and
        DNA damage-inducible gene 45), gas2 and gas3 (growth
        arrest-associated genes 2 and 3) [ 5 6 38 39 ] . However,
        C/EBPα mutants defective in DNA binding still blocked
        proliferation [ 25 33 ] . This suggested that direct
        promoter activation was unnecessary, or redundant, for
        C/EBPα proliferation arrest [ 18 ] .
        Possible mechanisms of transcription-independent
        proliferation arrest by C/EBPα have been suggested by a
        number of studies. Decreased proliferation was associated
        with C/EBPα stabilization of the p21 protein [ 22 24 ] .
        p21 interacted directly with a large internal segment of
        C/EBPα that included transcription activation domain 3 [ 25
        ] (see Fig. 1A). CDK2 and CDK4 also interacted with
        segments of C/EBPα close to, and within, transcription
        activation domain 3 [ 36 ] . CDK2 also interacted with the
        basic region of the C/EBPα [ 25 ] . p21 also has a second
        interaction site, within the leucine zipper of C/EBPα [ 25
        ] . 
        in vitro, C/EBPα enhanced p21
        inhibition of CDK2 activity. C/EBPα inhibition of CDK2
        activity correlated with p21 binding to C/EBPα
        transcription activation domain 3 [ 25 ] . However,
        proliferation arrest by C/EBPα still occurred in cell lines
        not containing p21 genes [ 40 ] . This indicated that
        proliferation arrest by C/EBPα did not rely solely upon
        C/EBPα enhancement of CDK inhibition by p21.
        Another mechanism reported for proliferation blockage by
        C/EBPα involves the E2F-DP1 transcription complexes. E2F
        complexes activate genes required for entry into S phase.
        C/EBPα binds to and inhibits transcriptional activation by
        E2F [ 26 33 ] . The complex of E2F with the
        retinoblastoma-related p107 protein is prevalent in cycling
        cells. Transcription activation domain 2 of C/EBPα was
        observed to interact specifically with p107 to disrupt
        p107/E2F complex formation [ 34 35 ] . Disruption of E2F
        activity also was associated the basic domain of C/EBPα [
        33 34 ] .
        Thus, a variety of interactions and mechanisms are
        potentially involved in proliferation arrest by C/EBPα.
        This variability may indicate divergent mechanisms for the
        block of proliferation by C/EBPα in different study
        conditions and/or cell types. In pituitary cells, C/EBPα is
        part of a multi-subunit complex [ 41 42 ] that activates
        the growth hormone [ 42 ] and prolactin [ 43 44 ]
        promoters. Full-length C/EBPα is absent from the pituitary
        progenitor GHFT1-5 cell line [ 42 45 ] in which ectopically
        expressed C/EBPα activates co-transfected growth hormone
        and prolactin promoters [ 42 44 45 ] . We show here that
        ectopically expressed C/EBPα prolongs GHFT1-5 cells in the
        G1 and S phases of the cell cycle in a
        transcription-independent fashion. Different C/EBPα domains
        were required for G1- and S-phase arrest. C/EBPα domains
        previously described for the interaction with p21 were not
        required for arrest in GHFT1-5 cells. Rather, domains
        previously implicated in the regulation of the E2F and CDK2
        pathways by C/EBPα were required for arrest of these
        progenitor cells.
      
      
        Results
        
          Transcriptionally active and inactive GFP fusions
          with C/EBPα
          The domains of C/EBPα and their known interactions
          with cell-cycle proteins are summarized in figure 1A. We
          conducted studies to determine which, if any, of those
          activities affect the proliferation of GHFT1-5 pituitary
          progenitor cells. In prior studies, we noticed that fewer
          cells were present in GHFT1-5 cell cultures transfected
          with the C/EBPα expression vector than in cultures
          transfected with control vectors (X. Wang, F. S.,
          unpublished data). The decreased cell number might be due
          to impaired proliferation of GHFT1-5 cells expressing
          C/EBPα. To examine if C/EBPα affected the progression of
          GHFT1-5 cells through the cell cycle, we needed to
          distinguish transfected cells that expressed C/EBPα from
          those that did not. We fused the cDNA for the green
          fluorescence protein (GFP) to either the 5' (GFP-C/EBPα)
          or the 3' (C/EBPα-GFP) end of the coding sequence of the
          C/EBPα cDNA. The cDNAs for the GFP-C/EBPα and C/EBPα-GFP
          fusion proteins were inserted into an expression vector
          and transfected into GHFT1-5 cells. Flow cytometry was
          used to specifically identify green fluorescent,
          C/EBPα-expressing cells.
          We initially characterized the abilities of the
          C/EBPα-GFP and GFP-C/EBPα fusion proteins to bind DNA and
          activate transcription in GHFT1-5 cells (Fig. 2). The
          C/EBPα-GFP or GFP-C/EBPα expression vectors were
          transfected into GHFT1-5 cells with a promoter consisting
          of a single C/EBPα binding site upstream of the growth
          hormone TATA box. This minimal promoter was specifically
          responsive to C/EBPα expression in GHFT1-5 cells [ 45 46
          ] . Cells transfected with the C/EBPα-GFP expression
          vector showed a statistically significant (p<0.05, n =
          5) 9.66 +/- 6.08-fold higher promoter activity than did
          cells sham-transfected with the same expression vector
          deleted of the C/EBPα cDNA (Fig. 2A). In contrast,
          activation by GFP-C/EBPα was a statistically
          insignificant 1.88 +/- 1.48-fold (Fig. 2A). Promoter
          activation by C/EBPα-GFP was reproducibly less than
          promoter activation by unfused C/EBPα. Western blots of
          nuclear extracts from the transfected cells showed that
          unfused C/EBPα was expressed at marginally higher levels
          (Fig. 2B).
          C/EBPα-GFP and GFP-C/EBPα both were expressed as
          intact, full-length proteins of the appropriate molecular
          weight [ 45 ] (Fig. 2B, arrow). In addition, both
          C/EBPα-GFP and GFP-C/EBPα bound similarly to DNA (Fig.
          2C). Extracts of cells expressing either C/EBPα-GFP or
          GFP-C/EBPα shifted the electrophoretic mobility of a
          radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing a C/EBPα binding
          site (Fig. 2C). No shift was observed with
          sham-transfected cells (not shown). The shifted bands
          were specifically competed by a 100-fold molar excess of
          the cold oligonucleotide and were supershifted with an
          antibody directed against C/EBPα. GFP-C/EBPα truncated of
          its leucine zipper (Fig. 1B) was ineffective at shifting
          the binding site (Fig. 2C, ΔLZ). Flow cytometry
          (discussed later) showed that comparable levels of green
          fluorescence were emitted from cells expressing
          C/EBPα-GFP, GFP-C/EBPα and ΔLZ. Thus, C/EBPα-GFP and
          GFP-C/EBPα were expressed and could bind to C/EBPα
          binding sites in DNA, but differed in their ability to
          activate gene transcription.
        
        
          Cell cycle distribution of GHFT1-5 cells
          Transcriptionally active C/EBPα-GFP and
          transcriptionally inactive GFP-C/EBPα were compared for
          their effects on proliferation of GHFT1-5 cells. We first
          determined the distribution of untransfected GHFT1-5
          cells in each phase of the cell cycle. GHFT1-5 cells were
          grown to subconfluence, collected and the DNA within the
          cells was stained with propidium iodide. The DNA content
          within each cell was quantified by flow cytometry as the
          amount of orange fluorescence from the propidium
          iodide-stained DNA (see Materials and Methods for
          details). The fluorescence intensity measured from each
          cell falls into one of three populations: cells centered
          around the lowest level of orange fluorescence, cells
          centered around the highest level of orange fluorescence
          which is twice that of the lowest, and cells with
          intermediate levels of orange fluorescence. This
          corresponds, respectively, to cells containing a 2n DNA
          complement prior to duplication of the genome (in G1
          phase), cells containing a 4n DNA complement following
          genome duplication (in growth phase 2 or in mitosis,
          G2/M), and cells containing a partially replicated genome
          intermediate between 2n and 4n (in S phase). As averaged
          from nine independent experiments, the proportion of
          growing GHFT1-5 cells in G1, S and G2/M corresponded to
          42%, 38% and 20%, respectively (Fig 3, white bars).
          We next synchronized GHFT1-5 cells in particular
          stages of the cell cycle. GHFT1-5 cells were treated for
          20 hours with nocodazole, which prevents microtubule
          polymerization/depolymerization and exit from M phase [
          47 ] . The delivery vehicle, DMSO, was added to parallel
          cell cultures. Cells also were treated with mimosine (in
          DMSO), which blocks cells in late G1 immediately before
          entry into S phase [ 48 ] . Mimosine also prolongs some
          cell types in the S phase itself [ 48 ] . GHFT1-5 cells
          grow with an average doubling time of approximately 18 to
          24 hours. 20 hours of treatment allowed most cells to
          pass through one cell cycle and to accumulate as 4n cells
          upon nocodazole treatment (Fig. 3, light gray bars) or as
          2n cells at the G1/S boundary upon mimosine treatment
          (Fig. 3, stippled gray bars). Thus, GHFT1-5 cells can be
          synchronized at particular stages of the cell cycle.
          Synchronization facilitated characterization of the cell
          cycle stages blocked or prolonged by C/EBPα
          expression.
        
        
          Transcriptionally active and inactive C/EBPα both
          retain GHFT1-5 cells in the G1 and S phases of the cell
          cycle
          We determined if either C/EBPα-GFP or GFP-C/EBPα
          altered the distribution of GHFT1-5 cells in the G1, S or
          G2/M phases of the cell cycle. GHFT1-5 cells were
          transfected with the expression vectors for C/EBPα-GFP or
          GFP-C/EBPα, or with the sham expression vector not
          containing the C/EBPα cDNA. The cells were incubated for
          one day to allow time for C/EBPα expression. Cells were
          then synchronized in M-phase or in G1/S by 20-hour
          incubations with nocodazole (Fig. 4A) or mimosine (Fig.
          4B). Cells were collected and stained with propidium
          iodide. Flow cytometry was used to measure DNA content in
          1) cells transfected with the sham expression vector
          (Fig. 4, Sham), 2) green fluorescent cells expressing
          GFP-tagged C/EBPα (Fig. 4, C/EBPα-GFP or GFP-C/EBPα) or
          3) the subpopulation of cells from the C/EBPα-GFP or
          GFP-C/EBPα transfections that did not express measurable
          amounts of green fluorescent C/EBPα (Fig. 4, No C/EBP).
          The "No C/EBP" cells represent an internal control for
          cells not expressing C/EBPα collected simultaneously with
          cells expressing C/EBPα. The No C/EBP controls also
          indicated the extent to which green fluorescent,
          C/EBPα-expressing cells were distinguished from
          non-expressing cells by flow cytometry. For all our
          experiments, the distribution of cells in the G1, S and
          G2/M phases was similar for the "No C/EBPα " and
          sham-transfected cells.
          The expression of C/EBPα-GFP or GFP-C/EBPα resulted in
          a statistically significant decrease in the amount of
          cells blocked in G2/M upon nocodazole treatment compared
          to sham-transfected cells (Fig. 4A) (p << 0.01, n =
          6). This indicated that C/EBPα expression prevented a
          significant proportion of GHFT1-5 cells from reaching
          G2/M to be blocked by nocodazole. When cells were blocked
          in G1 by mimosine treatment, C/EBPα expression caused no
          decrease in the proportion of cells in G2/M (Fig. 4B).
          This demonstrated that C/EBPα expression did not actively
          decrease the proportion of cells in G2/M.
          The C/EBPα-induced reduction in cells blocked in G2/M
          was associated with a highly statistically significant
          increase in the proportion of GHFT1-5 pituitary
          progenitor cells in G1 (p < 0.001) and a statistically
          significant increase in the proportion of cells in S
          phase (p < 0.03) (Fig. 4A). This retention of GHFT1-5
          cells in the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle occurred
          for both the transcriptionally active C/EBPα-GFP and
          inactive GFP-C/EBPα fusions. The independence of
          C/EBPα-induced proliferation arrest from C/EBPα-regulated
          transcriptional activation also has been observed in
          other studies [ 25 26 ] . Thus, simple transcription
          activation mechanisms do not account for the effect of
          C/EBPα on the cell cycle.
        
        
          Targeting of C/EBPα to the presumed centromeric
          G1/S checkpoint is insufficient for prolongation of
          G1
          Our prior fluorescence microscopy studies showed that
          C/EBPα-GFP, GFP-C/EBPα, and antibody-stained C/EBPα [ 45
          46 ] , concentrated at specific intranuclear domains in
          GHFT1-5 cells (see Fig. 5A, GFP-C/EBPα). These domains
          coincide with regions that stain with the blue
          fluorescent DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342 (Fig. 5A,
          Hoechst 33342). Hoechst 33342 stains AT-rich DNA that
          concentrates around the centromeres [ 45 49 ] . Given the
          role of the centromere as a checkpoint for regulation of
          the mitotic phase of the cell cycle [ 50 51 ] , it was
          hypothesized that C/EBPα localization around the
          centromere could play a role in C/EBPα regulation of the
          cell cycle [ 49 ] .
          To investigate if targeting of C/EBPα to the
          peri-centromeric chromatin is necessary or sufficient to
          cause G1 and S phase prolongation in GHFT1-5 cells, we
          first determined the domain of C/EBPα required to target
          C/EBPα to the peri-centromeric chromatin. It was
          previously suggested that the peri-centromeric targeting
          of C/EBPα was a function of DNA binding: C/EBPα binding
          sites are concentrated within the repeated DNA sequences
          that comprise the bulk of peri-centromeric chromatin [ 49
          ] . Indeed, C/EBPα truncated to contain little more than
          the DNA binding, bZIP domain still concentrated at
          peri-centromeric chromatin [ 45 ] . By contrast, C/EBPα
          deleted of amino acids 310 to 358 (Fig. 1B, ΔLZ) no
          longer targeted to the peri-centromeric DNA (Fig. 5B).
          This deletion disrupts DNA binding (Fig. 2C) by
          eliminating the leucine zipper required for DNA binding
          by all members of the bZIP family of transcription
          factors [ 52 ] . Thus, as predicted [ 49 ] , the bZIP
          domain is necessary and sufficient for C/EBPα targeting
          to peri-centromeric chromatin.
          When expressed in GHFT1-5 cells, ΔLZ was as effective
          as full-length GFP-C/EBPα in prolonging both G1 and S
          (Fig. 6A). Thus, leucine zipper dimerization,
          site-specific DNA binding and targeting of C/EBPα to
          peri-centromeric were not required for C/EBPα
          prolongation in G1 and S. In contrast, the isolated
          C/EBPα bZIP DNA binding domain (Fig. 1B, DBD), which
          still targeted to peri-centromeric chromatin, did not
          prolong G1 (Fig. 6B). S phase remained prolonged upon DBD
          expression. The different effects of the isolated DBD on
          G1 and S blockage indicated that C/EBPα regulation of G1
          and S phase arrest was mechanistically distinct. Thus,
          C/EBPα regulates proliferation by two distinct pathways.
          Both pathways do not depend upon site-specific DNA
          binding, which is commonly considered a prerequisite for
          gene-specific transcription.
        
        
          Prolongation in G1 requires the amino terminal
          domain of C/EBPα
          The C/EBPα DBD therefore was insufficient for
          prolongation of G1 (Fig. 6B). We next determined which
          additional domains of C/EBPα were required for G1
          prolongation. C/EBPα amino acids 1-154 or 154-257 were
          appended to the DBD (see Fig. 1B). The addition of amino
          acids 1-154 (Fig. 7, DBD + 1-154) caused a statistically
          significant increase, relative to sham-transfected cells,
          in the proportion of cells in G1 (p << 0.01, n =
          6). The proportion of cells in G1 was not statistically
          different in cells expressing DBD + 1-154 from that in
          cells expressing full-length C/EBPα-GFP. Adding amino
          acids 1-125, instead of amino acids 1-154, caused a
          similar prolongation in G1 (Fig. 7, DBD + 1-125). Thus,
          an element in the amino terminal domain of C/EBPα was
          required for G1 prolongation.
          In contrast, addition of amino acids 154-257 to C/EBPα
          DBD did not rescue G1 prolongation (Fig. 7, DBD +
          154-257). Again, appending amino acids 1-125 to this
          mutant restored G1 prolongation (A126-153), as did amino
          acids 1-97 (A 98-153). All of the mutants contained the
          DBD and prolonged the cell cycle in S phase (Fig. 7).
          Thus, the DNA binding, bZIP domain was sufficient to
          direct S phase regulation by C/EBPα whereas amino acids
          1-97 contained a domain required for G1 regulation.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          C/EBPα prolongs GHFT1-5 cells in G1 and S
          The differentiative and anti-mitotic actions of C/EBPα
          have been observed in a variety of cell culture models [
          23 24 26 40 53 ] . To date, studies of the C/EBPα block
          of proliferation have relied on comparing the growth [ 23
          24 25 40 ] or DNA synthetic [ 22 24 25 26 27 ] rates of
          C/EBPα-expressing and non-expressing cells. These studies
          suggest that multiple, possibly independent, mechanisms
          may contribute to C/EBPα arrest in a variety of cells [
          18 23 24 25 26 33 34 35 36 37 40 54 55 56 ] . Studies
          that distinguish the anti-proliferative actions of C/EBPα
          at different phases of the cell cycle, and in specific
          cell types, may clarify these discrepancies.
          Our studies showed that C/EBPα expression prolonged
          the proliferation of GHFT1-5 pituitary progenitor cells
          at two different phases of the cell cycle, G1 and S (Fig.
          4). A G1 block has been reported previously in
          C/EBPα-expressing mouse L cells [ 26 ] . However, those
          studies did not define the activities within C/EBPα
          required for that blockage. Here, we observed that
          prolongation in G1 required the amino terminal 97 amino
          acids of C/EBPα (Fig. 7.). In contrast, amino acids 1 to
          97 were not required for S phase arrest (Figs. 6, 7).
          This showed that C/EBPα prolongation of GHFT1-5 cells in
          the G1 and S phases occurred through molecularly distinct
          pathways. Such distinct effects on G1 and S may
          contribute to the wide variations in mechanisms reported,
          to date, to participate in proliferation arrest by
          C/EBPα.
        
        
          Cell Cycle Proteins and C/EBPα Inhibition of
          Proliferation
          Candidate mechanisms for the block of proliferation by
          C/EBPα include 1) activation of the gene promoters of the
          cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 [ 37 ] , gadd45 [ 5
          6 ] , gas2 and gas3 [ 38 39 ] , 2) post-transcriptional
          stabilization of p21 [ 22 ] , or 3) interactions of
          C/EBPα with cell cycle proteins including p21 [ 22 24 25
          55 ] , CDK2 [ 25 36 ] , CDK4 [ 36 ] , retinoblastoma [ 54
          ] , the retinoblastoma-related protein p107 [ 34 ] and
          the G1/S-regulating E2F transcription complex [ 26 33 ]
          (Fig. 1A). We found that transcriptional activation
          domain 3 and the leucine zipper were not required for
          prolongation of either G1 or S (Fig 7). These domains
          interact with p21, CDK2 and CDK4 [ 22 24 25 36 55 ] .
          Thus, C/EBPα interactions with at least p21 and CDK4 were
          not required for the anti-proliferative actions of C/EBPα
          in GHFT1-5 cells. CDK2, and other proteins, also interact
          with another domain of C/EBPα [ 25 ] required for
          proliferation arrest (discussed below).
          Arrest in S phase was associated with amino acids 259
          to 310 (Fig. 6), which include the basic amino acid-rich,
          DNA binding region of C/EBPα. C/EBPα deleted of the
          leucine zipper dimerization domain, also required for DNA
          binding [ 25 ] (Fig. 2C), was as effective as full-length
          GFP-C/EBPα in prolonging both S and G1 (Fig. 6A). Thus,
          DNA binding 
          per se was not required for
          proliferation arrest. The basic region of C/EBPα blocks
          the transcriptional activity of E2F by unknown mechanisms
          [ 33 ] and contains another known CDK2-interaction site [
          25 ] . Either of these activities may contribute to basic
          region-dependent, S phase arrest of GHFT1-5 cell
          proliferation.
          G1 block in GHFT1-5 cells required C/EBPα amino acids
          1-97 (Fig. 7), comprising activation domains 1 and 2 [ 31
          ] . Amino acids 1 to 97 have been implicated in C/EBPα
          growth arrest via the E2F/pl07 complexes [ 34 35 ] .
          C/EBPα interaction with p107 is believed to prevent the
          formation of an S-phase promoting complex containing p107
          and E2F [ 26 34 35 ] . Thus, G1 block in GHFT1-5 cells
          may be related to the ability of C/EBPα to interact with
          p107. However, the amino terminus of C/EBPα also
          functionally interacts with a number of other factors [
          31 45 46 ] , any of which might contribute to
          proliferation arrest.
        
        
          Subnuclear Architecture and C/EBPα Inhibition of
          Proliferation
          Tang and Lane [ 49 ] showed that C/EBPα becomes
          associated with peri-centromeric chromatin upon
          expression during adipocyte differentiation. We observed
          that C/EBPα, expressed in mouse pituitary progenitor
          GHFT1-5 cells, also localized to peri-centromeric
          chromatin [ 45 ] . Here we show that targeting of C/EBPα
          to peri-centromeric chromatin in GHFT1-5 cells required
          the DNA binding domain of C/EBPα (Fig. 5). However,
          C/EBPα deleted of the DNA binding domain was as effective
          as full-length C/EBPα in prolonging GHFT1-5 cells in the
          G1 and S phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 6A). Thus, the
          specific association of C/EBPα with peri-centromeric
          chromatin, speculated to contribute to C/EBPα growth
          arrest [ 49 ] , was not necessary for disruption of the
          cell cycle by C/EBPα. The independence of C/EBPα
          regulation of proliferation from its intranuclear
          localization may even be necessary since we have recently
          determined that pituitary cell differentiation is
          associated with the dispersal of C/EBPα from
          peri-centromeric heterochromatin by the
          pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1 (J. F. E.,
          M. A. Kawecki, F. S., R. N. D., submitted).
        
        
          Transcription-Independent Inhibition of
          Proliferation
          Transcription factors, like C/EBPα, may regulate cell
          proliferation by directly controlling the expression of
          proteins required for cell cycle progression. Indeed,
          C/EBPα activates transcription of the p21 [ 37 ] , gadd45
          [ 5 6 ] , gas2 and gas3 [ 38 39 ] genes. However, similar
          levels of p21 mRNA in the livers of wild-type and
          homozygous C/EBPα knock-out mice [ 22 ] argue against a
          physiologically significant contribution of C/EBPα to p21
          gene transcription in the liver. We also observed that
          transcriptionally inactive and DNA-binding-defective
          forms of C/EBPα still blocked GHFT1-5 cell proliferation
          in both the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle (Figs. 2,
          4, 6). DNA-binding-defective mutants of C/EBPα have also
          been observed to block proliferation in other cell lines
          [ 25 33 ] . Together, this suggests that C/EBPα
          regulation of transcription, in general, might not
          contribute to the regulation of cell proliferation. It
          remains possible that C/EBPα activation of the
          transcription of some cell cycle regulatory genes does
          control proliferation in some cell types or under certain
          conditions [ 8 37 38 39 56 ] .
          The absence of a dependence of GHFT1-5 cell
          proliferation on transcription factor activities that are
          more classically associated with transcription regulation
          strongly suggests that C/EBPα, and perhaps other
          transcription factors, control proliferation and
          transcription through completely separable pathways. The
          effects of human papilloma virus E7 proteins on
          C/EBPα-induced differentiation and growth arrest also
          suggest that the effects of C/EBPα on proliferation are
          mechanistically divergent [ 40 ] . Having distinct
          mechanisms for regulation of gene transcription and
          proliferation allows a transcription factor to regulate
          these two critical processes completely independently of
          one another. This may be particularly important in
          differentiated, non-proliferating cells in which events
          that regulate a transcription factor's contribution to
          gene expression must be disconnected from that
          transcription factor's continuing blockage of
          proliferation.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        C/EBPα is a transcription factor that controls both
        proliferation and gene expression. C/EBPα uses molecularly
        distinct mechanisms to prolong the G1 and S phases of
        pituitary progenitor GHFT1-5 cells. The anti-proliferative
        effects of C/EBPα do not require activities in C/EBPα
        commonly required for gene-specific transcription.
        Proliferation arrest instead corresponds with C/EBPα
        domains previously implicated in post-transcriptional
        effects on E2F and/or CDK2 activity.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Plasmid construction
          The GFP-C/EBPα vector was constructed by inserting the
          cDNA encoding the S65T derivative of GFP [ 57 ] at the
          start codon of the cDNA encoding rat C/EBPα. The fused
          cDNA was cloned into a previously described expression
          vector [ 58 ] . The GFP and C/EBPα portions of the fusion
          were separated by a 16 amino acid long linker including
          the epitope for the FLAG antibody. The C/EBPα-GFP vector
          was constructed by inserting the S65T GFP into the NcoI
          site present near the carboxy terminus of rat C/EBPα
          (also tagged at the amino terminus with the FLAG epitope)
          in our previously described C/EBPα expression vector [ 42
          ] . This resulted in a deletion of the last four amino
          acids of C/EBPα. The DBD and DBD + 154-257 derivatives of
          C/EBPα were constructed by replacing, respectively, the
          amino terminal 257 amino acids of C/EBPα-GFP (to the
          SgrAI site of C/EBPα) and the amino terminal 153 amino
          acids of C/EBPα-GFP (to the NotI site of C/EBPα) with
          oligonucleotides containing a strong Kozak sequence. DBD
          + 1-154 was constructed by replacing amino acids 155 to
          257 (from the NotI to SgrAI sites) with an
          oligonucleotide. The remaining constructs (Fig. 7) were
          generated by appending C/EBPα fragments to the NotI site
          of DBD + 1-154, or to the SgrAI site of DBD. ΔLZ was
          constructed by deleting amino acids from amino acid 310
          (Tth111II site) at the junction of the basic region and
          leucine zipper of C/EBPα to the carboxy terminus of the
          GFP-C/EBPα fusion. The C/EBP-TATA reporter used to
          determine the transcriptional activity of the two GFP
          fusion proteins was previously described [ 45 ] .
        
        
          Transfection
          GHFT1-5 cells were propagated at 37°C and 5% CO 
          2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle
          (DME-H21) medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.
          Approximately 1 × 10 7cells were transfected by
          electroporation, as previously described [ 42 ] , with 5
          μg of either the C/EBPα-GFP, GFP-C/EBPα, or control
          expression vectors. Following transfection, cells were
          propagated at 33°C. Incubation at 33°C results in
          significantly higher levels of green fluorescence
          (unpublished data), presumably because of better folding
          of the jellyfish GFP. Transfected cells were maintained
          in the dark throughout the experiment to minimize
          fluorescence activation of GFP prior to flow
          cytometry.
        
        
          DNA Binding and Promoter Activation
          Electrophoretic mobility shifts assays were done by
          mixing a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing a
          consensus, high affinity C/EBP binding site
          (GATCGAGCCCCATTGCGCAATCATAGATC) together with extracts
          prepared from transfected cells as previously described [
          58 59 ] . Competition with the same, unlabeled
          oligonucleotide in 1, 10 or 100 molar excess of the
          radiolabeled probed indicated specific binding. The
          protein DNA complex was supershifted with an antibody
          directed against C/EBPα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
          sc-61). For studies of the transcriptional activation
          properties of the fusion proteins, 1 μg of the C/EBP-TATA
          vector [ 45 ] was co-transfected and transcriptional
          activity was assessed by measuring the amount of
          chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter expressed with
          and without C/EBPα expression [ 45 ] .
        
        
          Fluorescence Microscopy
          Following transfection, most cells were plated into 14
          cm dishes and allowed to grow for 24 hours. This ensured
          that the cells were not confluent by the time of
          collection for cell cycle analysis. A small portion of
          the transfected cells were cultivated on a 22 × 22 mm No.
          1 borosilicate glass cover slip in a separate 6-well dish
          and treated with nocodazole, mimosine or vehicle alone as
          described below. The coverslips were removed for
          fluorescence microscopic observation immediately before
          collecting cells for flow cytometric analysis of DNA
          content and GFP expression. Cells were stained 10-20
          minutes with 5 μg/ml of the cell-permeable DNA binding
          dye Hoechst 33342. The green fluorescence emitted from
          C/EBPα tagged with GFP and the blue fluorescence emitted
          from Hoechst 33342-stained DNA were readily distinguished
          by selectively exciting each fluorophore and capturing
          fluorescence emissions specific for each fluorophore
          using appropriate excitation and emission filter sets
          (Chroma Technology Corporation, Brattelboro, VT) [ 45 ] .
          The images shown in Fig. 5were acquired using an Olympus
          40X PlanApochromat (0.95 numerical aperture) objective on
          an Olympus IX-70 microscope. Metamorph acquisition
          software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA)
          on an Orca cooled interline camera (Hamamatsu,
          Bridgewater, NJ) were used to collect the images.
        
        
          Post-transfection Cell Synchronization
          The C/EBPα fusion proteins were expressed for one day
          following transfection, after which we added to the cell
          culture media 100 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) in
          dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), 0.5 mM mimosine (Sigma) in
          DMSO, or DMSO vehicle. In some experiments, cells were
          also grown for 48 and 72 hours post-transfection before
          applying nocodazole (data not shown). The distributions
          of cells in G1, S and G2/M, in the presence or absence of
          C/EBPα expression, were similar for cells grown for 24
          (reported here), 48 or 72 hours (data not shown) prior to
          nocodazole addition. Following nocodazole, mimosine or
          DMSO addition, the transfected GHFT1-5 cells continued to
          be cultivated at 33°C.
        
        
          Flow Cytometry
          24 hours after drug or vehicle treatment, transfected
          cells were trypsinized, collected in DME-H21 media
          containing 10% fetal calf serum, and washed twice with
          PBS. The harvested cells (typically 5 × 10 6to 1 × 10
          7cells) were resuspended in 300 μl of 8 μg/ml propidium
          iodide (Molecular Probes) in PBS containing 0.1% NP-40
          and 10 μg/ml RNAse A, then incubated at room temperature
          in the dark for 30 minutes. The cell suspension was then
          analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson)
          at a flow rate of 12 μl/min. Fluorescence of the GFP and
          propidium iodide-bound DNA was excited with a 488 nm
          argon-ion laser. Green GFP fluorescence was collected
          using a 530/30-nm band pass filter, and orange emission
          from propidium iodide-bound DNA was detected using a
          585/42-nm band pass filter. Photomultiplier tube voltage
          and spectral compensation were initially set using
          single-stained cells (cells expressing GFP fusions with
          C/EBPα but not stained with propidium iodide and cells
          transfected with the control vector containing no GFP
          cDNA but stained with propidium iodide). Electronic
          compensation was adjusted among the fluorescence channels
          to remove residual spectral overlap. The area and width
          of each event were measured to discriminate intact single
          cells from debris and from doublet or multiple cells
          stuck together. GFP fluorescence and propidium
          iodide-stained DNA fluorescence was thus collected from
          single cells. A minimum of 10,000 cellular events was
          collected for each sample. Data was analyzed using
          CELLQuest software (Becton Dickenson), and cell cycle
          subset analyses of DNA histograms were performed using
          ModFitLT™ software (Verity Software House, Topsham,
          ME).
        
        
          Statistical Analysis
          One-way analysis of variance was used to compare data
          from multiple independent experiments. Statistically
          significant differences (**, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05
          compared to the Sham-transfected cells) and experiment
          number are indicated in the figures and legends. All
          significant differences were confirmed by paired,
          one-tailed t-tests.
