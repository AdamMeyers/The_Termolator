        The lysosome is a pivotal organelle responsible for a
        diverse spectrum of cellular functions including protein
        and lipid catabolism, vesicular transport and sorting [ 1 ]
        . Abnormal lysosomal physiology may result in cellular
        dysfunction, and eventually lead to a variety of diseases.
        For example, deficiencies of various enzymes responsible
        for lipid metabolism result in lipid accumulation in
        lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann-Pick and Gaucher
        diseases [ 2 ] . Alternatively, modulation of lysosomal
        lumen pH may alter membrane trafficking and associated
        metabolic processes. It has been reported that elevated
        lysosomal pH is associated with the genetic lysosomal
        disorder, Mucolipidosis type IV disease where various
        sphingolipids and mucolipids accumulate in the lysosome [ 3
        ] . Finally, lysosomes may play multiple roles in cellular
        oxidative metabolism [ 4 ] . The oxidative activity in
        lysosomes may regulate the modification of proteins and
        lipids, resulting in disruption of lysosomal membrane
        integrity [ 5 ] .
        The tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) has
        been shown to activate the NADPH (nicotinamide adenine
        dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase and initiate the oxidative
        burst response in various phagocytes, including neutrophils
        and the macrophage-like cell line J774A.1 [ 6 7 ] . During
        the oxidative burst, generation of reactive oxygen species
        (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H 
        2 O 
        2 ) and superoxide anion (O 
        2 •-), is involved in degranulation,
        secretion of lysosomal enzymes and subsequent cytotoxic
        killing of invading pathogens. Although activation of the
        NADPH oxidase complex in phagolysosomal or lysosomal
        membranes has been reported, 
        in situ generation of either H 
        2 O 
        2 or O 
        2 •-in these organelles in live cells
        has not been demonstrated [ 6 ] . This is partly due to the
        lack of appropriate indicators that can monitor the
        formation of these ROS and the concurrent change of
        oxidative activity in these vacuoles. Furthermore, since
        the charged free radical O 
        2 •-should have difficulty leaking
        across hydrophobic membranes, formation of this anion
        radical inside the lysosome may have an immediate impact on
        pH in this organelle. The question addressed in the present
        study is: what is the distribution of oxidative activity
        and pH changes in the lysosome when cells are stimulated
        with PMA. A fluorogenic substrate, OxyBURST™ Green H 
        2 HFF Bovine Serum Albumin (OxyBURST
        Green H 
        2 HFF BSA), was used to detect lysosomal
        oxidative activity. OxyBURST Green H 
        2 HFF BSA consists of bovine serum
        albumin coupled to
        dihydro-2',4,5,6,7,7'-hexafluorofluorescein (H 
        2 HFF), a reduced dye with improved
        chemical stability. The non-fluorescent BSA conjugate is
        internalized into cells through the endocytic pathway, and
        accumulates in lysosomes where the extent of its oxidation
        depends on the oxidative activity in this organelle. The
        spatial distribution of lysosomal pH in cells after PMA
        treatment was investigated using both
        fluorescein-conjugated dextran and a selective lysosomal
        probe, LysoTracker™ Red. Finally, possible mechanisms of
        regulation between pH and oxidative activity in lysosomes
        are discussed.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Effect of phorbol ester on the oxidative activities
          of lysosomes
          Although the location of activated NADPH oxidase
          complex in phagolysosomes has been reported, the release
          of either H 
          2 O 
          2 or O 
          2 •- 
          in situ upon stimulation with PMA
          has not been directly shown in live cells [ 10 11 ] . In
          order to directly measure the oxidative activity in
          lysosomes, I use a reduced fluorescein derivative that is
          conjugated with BSA, OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA, as shown in Figure 1.
          Spectrofluorimetric analysis indicates that this reduced
          compound is non-fluorescent, and becomes fluorescent upon
          HRP-catalyzed oxidation. Furthermore, upon incubation
          with macrophages, the reduced compound was internalized
          into cells through fluid phase endocytosis, and
          eventually accumulated in lysosomes. Therefore, the
          oxidation activity inside the lysosome determines the
          oxidation of the reduced dye. Upon oxidation, this
          compound emits strong fluorescence with emission maximum
          centered at λ 
          545 , which can be viewed and
          quantified using fluorescence microscopy.
          I first labeled the total lysosomal population in
          cells with a well-known lysosomal marker, dextran
          conjugated with Cascade Blue fluorophore, according to a
          previously reported procedure [ 8 ] (see Methods
          section). Cells were then labeled with OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA, followed by chase labeling
          without the reduced dye but in the presence or absence of
          200 nM PMA. Co-localization experiments indicate that all
          of the OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA is distributed in lysosomes
          but not endosomes after this labeling procedure (see
          below). The fluorescence intensity of the oxidized
          OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA in total lysosomal
          populations was then quantified by a process using
          Cascade Blue-conjugated dextran as a mask for lysosomes [
          8 ] . As shown in Table 1, when cells were treated with
          PMA, fluorescence intensity of the OxyBURST fluorophore
          in lysosomes significantly increased (i.e. oxidative
          activity, 150% vs. 100%). This increase in fluorescence
          is not due to the internalization of oxidized dye since
          no oxidation of the OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA was observed in the labeling
          medium during the loading procedure (data not shown).
          Furthermore, cells were incubated with the OxyBURST Green
          H 
          2 HFF at 37°C for 10 min so that the
          reduced dye is transported primarily into endosomes
          rather than lysosomes. Stimulation of endosome loaded
          cells with control medium or medium containing PMA
          resulted in no detectable changes in the fluorescent
          properties of the endosome population (data not shown).
          These results demonstrate that PMA initiates an elevation
          of oxidative activity selectively within lysosomes.
          In order to understand the 
          in situ enhancement of lysosomal
          oxidative activity by PMA, the subcellular distribution
          of the oxidized OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA in cells was investigated.
          As shown in Figure 2, oxidized OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA distributed within the
          population of lysosomes where they co-localized with the
          fluorescent dextran. It was also noticed that strong
          fluorescence of oxidized OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA only existed in a subset of
          lysosomes, as indicated by arrows in the inset.
        
        
          Effect of phorbol ester on lysosomal pH
          I next sought to investigate the effect of PMA
          treatment on lysosomal pH. Averaged lysosomal pH was
          measured in control cells or cells treated with PMA,
          using fluorescein-conjugated dextran in dual-excitation
          ratiometric mode [ 8 ] . The validation of lysosomal pH
          measurements was performed by the calibration curve using
          ionophore-clamped cells as shown in Figure 3. The ratio
          of emission fluorescence under excitation at 485 nm
          versus 440 nm (i.e. F 
          535 (λ 
          485 )/F 
          535 (λ 
          440 )) correlated linearly with
          calibrated lysosomal pHs from 4.0 to 6.5, with a high r
          2value of 0.9689. As shown in Table 1, the average pH in
          total lysosomal population significantly increased
          (0.1-0.6 pH units) upon PMA stimulation. Most
          interestingly, a heterogeneous distribution of lysosomes
          with elevated pH was observed by ratiometric images as
          shown in Figure 4. Here, lysosomal pH in untreated cells
          is very homogeneous, and estimated to be 4.3-4.5. Upon
          PMA treatment, pH was significantly elevated to as high
          as 6.5-7.5 in a subset of lysosomes (indicated by the
          arrow).
          The effect of PMA-induced oxidation on lysosomal pH as
          measured by the fluorescein-dextran is worthwhile further
          discussion (see Table 1and Figure 4). It is critical to
          test the possibility that the increase of oxidative
          activity may change the pH-dependence of
          fluorescein-dextran. In other words, lysosomes with
          higher oxidative activities may induce abnormal change of
          the pH-dependence of fluorescein-dextran that is within.
          If this is true, then the resulting F 
          535 (λ 
          485 )/F 
          535 (λ 
          440 ) ratio of the fluorescence is no
          longer pH-dependent, and can not be used as an indication
          of pH increase in lysosomes. To test this possibility,
          effect of HRP-catalyzed oxidation on pH-dependence of
          fluorescein-dextran was investigated 
          in vitro . As shown in Figure 5,
          increase in oxidation showed no effect on the
          pH-dependence of fluorescein-dextran. Conversely, changes
          in lysosomal pH do not affect the fluorescence of
          oxidized OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA as will be shown later.
        
        
          Regulation of lysosomal pH and oxidative
          activities
          The observation that there are elevations of both
          oxidative and pH activities in only a subset of lysosomes
          (Figures 2and 4) suggests that pH and oxidative activity
          may be coupled in this organelle. In order to demonstrate
          this relationship in live cells, the oxidative activities
          and pH in lysosomes were simultaneously monitored by
          OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA and LysoTracker Red DND-99
          which is able to qualitatively indicate acidic
          lysosomes.
          Briefly, cell monolayers were incubated with 200 μg/mL
          OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA at 37°C for 2 hours, washed,
          and then incubated in fresh medium containing 200 nM PMA
          at 37°C for 0.5 hour. Cell monolayers were washed and
          then incubated with 25 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99, at 37°C
          for 10 min, to label acidic lysosomes. Consistent with
          previous results, PMA treatment elicits high oxidative
          activity and thus increased OxyBURST fluorescent
          intensity in a subset of lysosomes (Figure 6).
          Interestingly, lysosomes with strong OxyBURST
          fluorescence contain only very weak fluorescence of
          LysoTracker Red (see arrows). On the other hand, acidic
          lysosomes strongly stained by LysoTracker Red exhibited
          very weak OxyBURST fluorescence (see arrowhead). The
          mutual regulation of oxidative activity and alkalinity in
          lysosomes can be better demonstrated by a ratio image as
          shown in the lower panel.
          LysoTracker Red DND-99 is a chloroquine analogue that
          had been reported to selectively accumulate in acidic
          lysosomes [ 9 ] . In the present study, when lysosomal pH
          was elevated to >6.5 and then cell was stained with
          the dye, the fluorescence in lysosomes greatly decreased
          or diminished. This decrease in fluorescence is due to a
          decrease in accumulation of the dye in lysosomes since
          the change in pH itself has no effect on the fluorescence
          of the dye (data not shown). Nevertheless, the
          fluorescence decrease of this dye in a subset of
          lysosomes after PMA stimulation could also result from
          reactions of the LysoTracker Red with higher oxidative
          activity, while the pH in this subset of lysosomes
          remains unchanged. This possibility was tested 
          in vitro by incubating LysoTracker
          Red with H 
          2 O 
          2 or KO 
          2 (as an O 
          2 -donor) in buffer solutions with
          acidic (4.5) or alkaline (7.5) pHs. As shown in Figure 7,
          the fluorescence of the LysoTracker Red is not affected
          by either of these two oxygen species. This data strongly
          supports the contention that decreased fluorescence of
          the LysoTracker Red in a subset of lysosomes does
          indicate elevation of pH.
          I then characterized the heterogeneous fluorescence
          distribution of oxidized OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA. Fluorescence of fluorescein
          and its analogs such as carboxyfluorescein has been shown
          to be pH-dependent [ 10 11 ] . Elevation of pH increases
          the ratio of fluorescent emission at λ 
          535 as excited by λ 
          485 over λ 
          440 . The heterogeneous fluorescence
          of the oxidized dye in subsets of lysosomes where it
          exhibits a significant difference in pH (4.5 to 7.5) may
          simply reflect the pH-dependency of the oxidized dye, and
          not represent different levels of oxidative activity
          among lysosomes. The pH-dependency of fluorescence of
          both oxidized OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA and 5-(and
          -6)-carboxyfluorescein were thus examined by the dual
          excitation ratiometric measurement 
          in vitro , as shown in Figure 8.
          While 5-(and -6)-carboxyfluorescein exhibits strong
          pH-dependency, the experiment clearly demonstrates that
          fluorescence of the oxidized OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA is not affected by variation
          of the pH within a range between 4.5 to 7.5.
          It is also possible that the heterogeneous
          distribution of fluorescence intensity of oxidized
          OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA is due to preferential
          accumulation of the reduced dye in a subset of lysosomes
          rather than being determined by a variation of oxidative
          activity in these lysosomes. In other words, lysosomes
          that accumulate more reduced dye will produce stronger
          fluorescence after PMA stimulation. To address this
          possibility, I performed the following experiment. Cell
          monolayers were grown on circular glass coverslips and
          labeled with OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA as previously described. The
          cells were then mounted onto a temperature-controlled
          stage with a perfusion chamber for microscopy. The
          temperature was controlled at 37°C throughout the
          experiment. Cells were then treated with 200 nM PMA for
          30 min, followed by 25 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99 for 5
          min to label lysosomes. Cells were next washed with PBS
          and the fluorescence images of both oxidized OxyBURST
          Green H 
          2 HFF BSA and LysoTracker Red were
          recorded. As shown in Figure 9a, the fluorescence
          intensity is higher in a subset of lysosomes (see arrow)
          that accumulate very little LysoTracker Red (Figure 9b).
          Conceivably, if there was more reduced dye in this
          lysosome area, complete oxidation of the reduced dye
          inside lysosomes should release more OxyBURST
          fluorescence. This was tested by adding H 
          2 O 
          2 to the cell (final concentration of
          0.05% in PBS). The cells were then incubated for an
          additional 15 min to allow oxidation of all the lysosomal
          OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA. The fluorescent image of
          oxidized OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA in the same cell was then
          recorded as shown in Figure 9c. The addition of H 
          2 O 
          2 resulted in a 4.5-fold average
          intensity increase (349.5 vs. 73.5) among the total
          lysosomal population. Fluorescence changes in five
          selected lysosomal areas before (insets, Fig. 9a) and
          after (insets, Fig. 9c) H 
          2 O 
          2 addition are further quantified as
          shown in Figure 10. The figure shows that the maximal
          fluorescence released by H 
          2 O 
          2 treatment among these five lysosomal
          areas is very similar (421.21-455.81 gray level/pixel
          area). Importantly, lysosomal area 2, which exhibited
          stronger fluorescence before H 
          2 O 
          2 treatment (175.12 gray level/pixel
          area), does not release more fluorescence after complete
          oxidation by the peroxide. This clearly eliminates the
          possibility that there is more OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA accumulating in lysosome
          area 2. The experiment strongly supports the notion that
          the oxidative activity within the lysosomal population is
          heterogeneous.
          One concern regarding to the use of OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA in the present study is that
          the accumulation of OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA itself may drive the
          increase in pH. If this is the case, then lysosomes
          containing OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA should have more alkaline
          pH. However, this possibility is not consistent with one
          observation that was presented in Figure 9where I showed
          that distribution of OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA was very homogenous among
          lysosomes, nevertheless not every lysosomes exhibited
          elevated lumen pH.
          Although direct measurements of lysosomal oxidative
          activity in live cells were not available before the
          present study, several lines of evidence did point to a
          regulatory mechanism in phagolysosomes or lysosomes in
          phagocytes during phagocytosis and oxidative burst.
          First, it has been shown that activation of NADPH oxidase
          during a phagocytosis event results in alkalization of
          phagolysosomal pH in the human neutrophil [ 10 ] . The
          phagolysosomal pH is influenced by NADPH oxidase activity
          and to a lesser extent by a Na +/H +antiporter. Secondly,
          disruption of normal lysosomal pH by lysosomotropic weak
          bases inhibits the respiratory burst in neutrophils [ 12
          ] . A normal transmembrane pH gradient in lysosomes is
          suggested to play an important role in assembling the
          NADPH oxidase complex during cell activation. These
          observations and my present results can be integrated and
          summarized in a model proposed in Figure 11. PMA
          treatment induces the assembly and activation of NADPH
          oxidase in the lysosomal membrane. Activation of the
          oxidase generates intralysosomal O 
          2 •-that is membrane impermeable, with
          a short life span and is converted to H 
          2 O 
          2 instantly by the consumption of
          protons (see (1)). H 
          2 O 
          2 then oxidizes the OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA that accumulates in the
          lysosome in the presence of peroxidases. This
          enzyme-catalyzed oxidation generates hydroxyl ion (OH -)
          and radical (OH) (see (2)). Intralysosomal pH elevation
          can be explained by a net effect of H +consumption and OH
          -generation. Alternatively, the reactive OH •radical may
          interact with lysosomal membrane lipids or proteins and
          disturb a normal transmembrane-dependent pH gradient [ 4
          5 ] . Eventually, the elevated pH may then act as a
          negative feedback control to down regulate the activation
          of the NADPH oxidase and inhibit oxidative activity.
          Finally, generation of ROS during phagocytosis has been
          implicated in inactivation of lysosomal enzymes [ 13 14 ]
          . It is conceivable that an elevation of lysosomal pH to
          as high as 6.5-7.5 will inactivate various proteases in
          this organelle.
          Another novel finding in the present study is the
          heterogeneous distribution of oxidative activity and pH
          in lysosomal population responding to PMA treatment.
          Heterogeneous distribution of low molecular weight
          redox-active iron has been reported in lysosomal
          population within cells, which may contribute to
          differing stability of lysosomal membranes to oxidative
          stress as shown by Brunk and colleagues [ 15 ] . Although
          the regulation of this heterogeneity is too complicated
          and beyond the scope of the present study, it does open
          up another window for investigating lysosomal trafficking
          in various diseases. For example, the accumulation of
          lipids in lysosomal storage diseases appears to be
          heterogeneous [unpublished data]. Oxidative activity and
          pH distribution may be used as 
          in situ indexes to improve our
          understanding of lipid accumulation in subsets of
          lysosomes. Understanding the regulation mechanism will be
          helpful in developing new treatment strategy for these
          diseases.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Using a novel indicator for oxidative activity, OxyBURST
        Green H 
        2 HFF BSA, I am able to study the
        distribution of lysosomal oxidative burst activity and its
        concurrent pH changes in live macrophage-like J744A.1 cell.
        The present result indicates that oxidative activity and pH
        in lysosomes are inter-regulated. Higher oxidative activity
        results in higher alkalinity while lower lysosomal pH is
        associated with lower oxidative activity. This approach
        provides a better opportunity to study the dynamic changes
        of oxidation and pH in phagolysosomes during phagocytosis,
        which can not be resolved by conventional biochemical
        analyses.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Reagents and cell cultures
          OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA, dextrans (10 K, lysine
          fixable) conjugated with either Cascade Blue or
          fluorescein fluorophores, LysoTracker Red DND-99 and
          5-(and -6)-carboxyfluorescein were from Molecular Probes,
          Inc. (Eugene, OR). Nigericin, Monensin, Phorbol
          12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), horseradish peroxidase
          (HRP, type IV) and hydrogen peroxide (H 
          2 O 
          2 ) were purchased from Sigma (St.
          Louis, MO). Potassium superoxide (KO 
          2 ) was from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI).
          All buffered solutions and other reagents for organic
          synthesis were analytical grade and freshly prepared.
          Murine macrophage-like cell line (J774A.1) was from
          American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). They
          were routinely grown in a monolayer (30%-50% confluence)
          on a glass cover slide at 37°C in DMEM (Dulbecco's
          Modified Eagle Medium), supplemented with 1% 
          L -glutamine, 1% HEPES
          [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-(2-ethanesulfonic acid)],
          0.5% gentamicin, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% Fetal
          Bovine Serum (Gibco, NY).
        
        
          Measurement of oxidative activity in lysosomes
          using OxyBURST Green H 2HFF BSA
          The lysosomal population was first labeled with a
          Cascade Blue-conjugated dextran as previously described [
          3 ] . The cell monolayer was then incubated with 200
          μg/mL OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA in complete culture medium
          at 37°C for 2 hours. Afterwards, excess dye was removed
          by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the
          cells were incubated in complete culture medium in the
          presence or absence of 200 nM PMA at 37°C for an
          additional 0.5 hour. The cell monolayer was then washed
          with PBS and the fluorescent staining of the oxidized
          OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA and Cascade Blue-conjugated
          dextran were then recorded by low-light level
          fluorescence microscopy with appropriate filters. The
          fluorescent intensity of the oxidized OxyBURST in the
          lysosomes was then quantified using the staining of
          Cascade Blue-conjugated dextran as a mask, as described
          previously [ 8 ] . The average fluorescence intensity
          (gray level/pixel area) in the mask region was then
          calculated and represents the relative oxidative activity
          in lysosomes. This procedure was repeated on images
          collected from seven or eight different cells in the same
          culture dish.
        
        
          Measurement of Lysosomal pH
          The pH of the lysosomal population in the J774A.1
          cells was measured by a dual excitation ratiometric
          measurement according to established procedures using the
          fluorescein-conjugated dextran [ 3 8 ] . Namely, cells
          were incubated with 2-5 mg/mL fluorescein-conjugated
          dextran for approximately 18 hours in culture medium.
          Cells were washed and then incubated for an additional
          0.5 hour in fresh culture medium in the presence or
          absence of 200 nM PMA. Samples were then washed with cold
          (4°C) MES (4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid) buffer
          solutions containing 5 mM NaCl, 115 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO 
          4 and 25 mM MES twice, and then
          observed under fluorescence microscope. Two low light
          level images of each cell were obtained at green emission
          region (λ 
          em = 515-565 nm), under sequential
          excitation by first at λ 
          ex 485 nm, and then at λ 
          ex 440 nm (10-nm band width).
          Background fluorescence was corrected by images of blank
          region of the same culture dish at both excitation
          wavelengths.
          Imaging analysis to calculate the ratio of green
          fluorescence in lysosomes under excitation by 485 and 440
          nm (" [F 
          535 (λ 
          485 )/F 
          535 (λ 
          440 )]") was carried out as previously
          described [ 3 ] . The ratiometric data were converted to
          pH using a calibration curve from the lysosomes of
          ionophore-clamped cells. These cells were treated with 10
          μM Monensin and 10 μM Nigericine and equilibrated for 2
          min with MES (4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid)
          calibration buffer with pHs from 4.0 to 7.0 prior to
          image acquisition.
        
        
          Selective staining of acidic lysosomes
          In order to stain acidic lysosomes, LysoTracker Red
          DND-99 was used. The LysoTracker Red DND-99 is a
          fluorescent analog of chloroquine, which selectively
          accumulates in lysosomes [ 9 ] . Cells were incubated
          with a 25 nM concentration of the dye at 37°C for 5 min.
          Afterwards, excess dye was removed by washing with PBS.
          The fluorescence distribution was then viewed using a
          rhodamine filter.
        
        
          Fluorescence microscopy and image processing
          Fluorescence microscopy was performed with an inverted
          microscope (DIAPHOT-TMD, Nikon) equipped with a Plan Apo
          60X (1.4 N.A.) objective and epifluorescence optics for
          various fluorophores including fluorescein (also for
          OxyBURST), Cascade Blue and rhodamine. A CCD camera
          (Quantix, Photometrics Ltd., AR) was used to obtain the
          microscopic images. Thirty-two fluorescence video images
          of cells were digitized (16 bits) and averaged using the
          Metamorph Image Processing system (Universal Imaging
          Corp., Media, PA).
        
        
          Spectrofluorimetric analyses
          Stock solutions of OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA were prepared in phosphate
          buffered saline (PBS) and stored under nitrogen at 4°C.
          The HRP-catalyzed oxidation of this compound was
          determined spectroscopically as follows. To a PBS
          solution containing 50 μg/mL of OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA, HRP was added to a final
          concentration of 4 μg/mL. The resulting solution was
          incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes to consume
          any endogenous H 
          2 O 
          2 . Afterwards, H 
          2 O 
          2 was added, with stirring, to a final
          concentration of 10 nM. The spectral change in emission
          resulting from the oxidation of this compound was then
          recorded on a spectrophotometer (F-4500, Hitachi
          Instruments, Inc., Tokyo, Japan).
          To study the effect of pH on the fluorescence of
          oxidized OxyBURST Green H 
          2 HFF BSA and 5-(and
          -6)-carboxyfluorescein, 78 μg/mL of the oxidized dye or
          4.2 μM 5-(and -6)-carboxyfluorescein were prepared in MES
          (4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid) buffer solutions
          containing 5 mM NaCl, 115 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO 
          4 and 25 mM MES (pHs from 4.5 to 7.5).
          The fluorescence emission ratio at λ 
          535 by excitation with λ 
          485 over that by excitation with λ 
          440 was then measured (i.e. F 
          535 (λ 
          485 )/F 
          535 (λ 
          440 )). The effect of pH on the
          fluorescence of LysoTracker Red DND-99 (final
          concentration is 2 μM) was similarly performed, except
          that the emission fluorescence at λ 
          592 was recorded upon excitation at λ 
          574 .
          The effects of H 
          2 O 
          2 and O 
          2 •-on the fluorescence of LysoTracker
          Red DND-99 were studied by preparing 2 μM solutions of
          the dye in MES buffer solutions at pH 4.5 or 7.5,
          containing various concentrations of H 
          2 O 
          2 and KO 
          2 . After incubation at room
          temperature for 10 min, the emission fluorescence at λ 
          592 was recorded as previously
          described.
          The effect of oxidation on pH-dependency of
          fluorescein-conjugated dextran was tested 
          in vitro by the HRP/H 
          2 O 
          2 oxidant-generating system. Briefly,
          fluorescein dextran (final concentration at 30 μg/ml) was
          prepared in MES calibration buffers with pHs ranging from
          3.0 to 7.3. These solutions were then incubated at 37°C
          for 30 min, in the absence or presence of H 
          2 O 
          2 and HRP (final concentrations are 1
          μM and 4 μg/mL, respectively). The fluorescence emission
          ratio, F 
          535 (λ 
          485 )/F 
          535 (λ 
          440 ), was then measured using SPEX
          Fluorolog 3 (Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ).
