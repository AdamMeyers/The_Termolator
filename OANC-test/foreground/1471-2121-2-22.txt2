        Recent work has shown that the Bcl-2 family regulates
        mitochondrial homeostasis during apoptosis [ 1 ] .
        Pro-apoptotic members, including Bax, Bak, Bid, and Bim,
        promote the release of death-inducing proteins, such as
        cytochrome c [ 2 3 ] , smac [ 4 ] , and endonuclease G [ 5
        ] , from mitochondria while anti-apoptotic members, such as
        Bcl-2 and Bcl-X 
        L , inhibit this release. Following
        release into the cytosol, these death-inducing proteins
        promote apoptotic cell destruction through multiple
        pathways including caspase activation and nuclear DNA
        fragmentation.
        In addition to controlling the release of pro-death
        proteins, the Bcl-2 family also alters the function of
        mitochondria undergoing apoptosis. Dysfunction of voltage
        dependent anion channel opening, ADP/ATP exchange, the
        electron transport chain, oxidative phosphorylation, and
        calcium buffering through the action of this family of
        proteins have been reported [ 6 7 8 ] . While early defects
        in the electron transport chain can be reversed by addition
        of exogenous cytochrome c, the damage eventually becomes
        refractory to cytochrome c addition [ 8 ] . This finding
        suggests that pro-death Bcl-2 proteins can damage
        mitochondrial function independent of cytochrome c
        loss.
        Recently, we demonstrated that the targeting of the
        pro-apoptotic protein tBid to mitochondria depends upon the
        presence of the mitochondria-specific lipid cardiolipin in
        a possibly unique structure [ 9 ] . Cardiolipin has a
        defined distribution pattern within mitochondria [ 10 ] .
        It is found in high concentrations throughout the inner
        membrane, including at contact sites where the inner
        membrane and outer membrane interact. Cardiolipin is
        present at much lower concentrations elsewhere in the outer
        membrane. This distinction suggests that tBid might
        localize to contact sites because of the arrangement of
        cardiolipin there. To test this hypothesis, we determined
        the submitochondrial localization of tBid using a new
        hybrid technique - immunoelectron tomography, which couples
        conventional immunoelectron microscopy with tomography to
        add the third dimension. Tomographic analysis was chosen
        because it enables quantitative three-dimensional
        examination of fine structure within the relevant
        mitochondrial domains in semi-thick sections and thereby
        facilitates accurate representation of the sometimes
        complex membrane topology of this organelle [ 11 12 ] .
        Immunoelectron tomography is ideal for testing the
        independence of two types of labels, or label and
        structural component (as employed in this study), and their
        deviation from independence - colocalization or mutual
        inhibition - because it allows true 3-D distances to be
        measured. We report here an analysis of the 3-D distances
        of immunogold-labeled tBid from contact sites on the
        periphery of liver mitochondria that strongly supports the
        colocalization of the two.
      
      
        Results
        Initially, we used wild type (WT) tBid that was
        myc-tagged for immunogold electron microscopy in our
        investigation of its localization along the mitochondrial
        periphery. Generally, WT tBid was observed to be in close
        proximity to contact sites (Fig. 1). However, the
        preservation of the outer membrane of isolated mouse liver
        mitochondria treated with this tBid was less than optimal
        for testing the hypothesis of tBid association with contact
        sites. A significant portion of the outer membrane was
        absent in most mitochondria observed, which may have been
        caused in part by the activity of this pro-apoptotic
        protein in releasing cytochrome c from the region between
        the outer and inner membranes. Neither was the gold
        labeling very high, most likely because a stripped outer
        membrane results in considerably fewer contact sites.
        Another pitfall was the use of 10-nm gold (as opposed to
        5-nm gold) particles, which resulted in streaks that
        sometimes obscured the peripheral membranes (Fig. 1b). Even
        though harder to see in the microscope, for our analysis of
        mutant tBid labeling, we resorted to the smaller-sized
        gold, which greatly diminished the artifactual
        streaking.
        To enhance mitochondrial membrane preservation, a point
        mutation changing the glycine residue at position 94 to
        glutamic acid in the BH3 domain of tBid was used. This
        mutation was previously shown to lower the cytochrome c
        releasing activity of tBid without affecting its targeting
        to mitochondria [ 3 ] . Mitochondria treated with tBid 
        G94E displayed better preservation of
        the outer membrane than those treated with WT tBid. Hence,
        because of better preservation of contact sites, the tBid 
        G94E was used primarily for the
        tomographic analysis. For immunogold labeling, a three-myc
        tag was placed at residue 67 of Bid 
        G94E . Following cleavage by caspase 8,
        a version of tBid 
        G94E was generated with the three-myc
        tag at the N-terminus of tBid 
        G94E . Monoclonal anti-myc antibody was
        used for immunogold labeling to ensure high specificity of
        binding.
        Before performing the time-expensive tomography,
        analysis of thin sections with conventional electron
        microscopy was used to judge the immunogold labeling
        quality. As expected, the number of gold particles per
        mitochondrion varied. However, most had several particles
        arrayed along the perimeter (Fig. 2). To confirm the
        specificity of labeling, three controls were analyzed by
        thin-section microscopy. Neither the no-primary control
        (Fig. 2) nor the second control, consisting of replacing
        the primary antibody with an excess of tBid 
        G94E (data not shown), showed any gold
        particles. The third control was the presence of a
        contaminant organelle, peroxisomes (Fig. 2); no gold
        particles were observed attached to them. All three
        controls for labeling specificity indicated that the
        non-specific immunogold background was very low. Further,
        on those mitochondrial surfaces where the outer membrane
        was inadvertently stripped off during the specimen
        processing, no gold was observed, which is to be expected
        as there is no contact site where there is no outer
        membrane.
        Electron tomography has several advantages over
        conventional two-dimensional immunogold electron microscopy
        that should be enumerated to understand the accuracy of the
        measurements made in this study. First, a more accurate
        localization of the 5-nm gold particles is possible because
        each slice of the tomographic reconstruction is about 2 nm
        in thickness compared with the typical 50-100 nm thickness
        used in conventional immuno-electron microscopy. Second,
        because the dimensions of contact sites (~14 nm diameter) [
        13 14 ] are considerably smaller than 50-100 nm, they are
        easily missed in conventional microscopy; this problem was
        removed by the typically finer sampling of electron
        tomography (~2 nm). Third, because tomography is inherently
        a 3-D tool, the 3-D placement of gold-labeled tBid 
        G94E was obtained in relation to the 3-D
        distribution of contact sites and gold beads at high
        resolution. Unlike two-dimensional electron micrographs,
        true Euclidean distance was measured at a resolution of 4
        nm (twice the pixel size, or thickness, according to
        Shannon sampling theory) in tomographic reconstructions
        from each gold bead to the nearest contact site. These
        measurements were then used for a statistical analysis of
        association.
        Tomographic reconstruction of immunogold-labeled
        semi-thick sections confirmed the preferential association
        of tBid with contact sites. Figure 3highlights features of
        a tomographic reconstruction of one of the tBid 
        G94E -labeled liver mitochondrion used
        in the statistical analysis. The mitochondrial volume
        sliced in three perpendicular planes where gold particles
        can be seen in all three faces (Fig. 3a, arrowheads)
        emphasizes the vast 3-D information available with
        tomography. Individual 2-nm slices illustrate how gold
        particles and contact sites can be easily identified with
        this hybrid, high-resolution technique (Fig. 3b). The
        insets in figure 3bshow two examples of gold particles near
        contact sites. Graphic representations of a segmented
        volume are shown in figure 3c. Segmentation is a visual
        tool that defines and dissects volumes and thus aids the
        interpretation and measurement of structural
        interrelationships [ 15 ] . Once segmented, volumes were
        surface-rendered. With the surface-rendered volume, the
        various components of interest can be oriented to best
        study the proximity of gold and contact sites in relation
        to the membrane topology. A wealth of information can be
        quickly taken in by rotating the segmented volumes
        http://ncmir.ucsd.edu/~perkins/tBid. For example, it became
        apparent that contact sites can be clustered (Fig. 3c,
        right-hand side of mitochondrion).
        We tested the association of tBid with contact sites by
        employing the statistics of spatial point patterns [ 16 ] .
        We measured the distances between the 3-D loci of all
        contact sites and immunogold particles in the tomographic
        reconstructions of WT tBid and tBid 
        G94E labeled mitochondria. The closest
        contact site to each particle was calculated in Euclidean
        (3-D) space. Table 1shows a comparison of experimental
        "nearest neighbors" with nearest neighbors expected from a
        random distribution of gold. The experimental mean value
        for nearest contact sites was significantly less than the
        random mean value for all mitochondria. We conducted a
        Student's t-test to test the null hypothesis that the
        experimental mean values would be reasonably likely to be
        obtained from sampling randomly. The probability of this
        test for "WT tBid 1" was 7.7 x 10 -6and was even lower for
        the other samples. Thus, at essentially any significance
        level, the null hypothesis is rejected and we conclude that
        the association of tBid with contact sites is not random.
        For an understanding of what constitutes "close
        association" of gold particle with contact site, it is
        important to consider that the finite size of
        immunoglobulin molecules is about 8-10 nm in the most
        extended state. Two immunoglobulin molecules were used for
        the labeling (primary and secondary antibodies). tBid and
        the myc-tag have molecular weights of ~22 kD and ~67 kD,
        respectively. Hence, myc-tagged tBid has a size of ~5 nm.
        The maximal size of the tBid-immunogold complex is thus
        about 30 nm for 5-nm gold (10+10+5+5 nm). Hence the
        distance between gold and contact site is not expected to
        be much less than this value. With this understanding, one
        can see that experimental means of 23-31 nm, shown in table
        1, are reasonable values for specific association of tBid
        with contact sites. This is especially true upon comparing
        with the mean distances of 70-129 nm from the random
        placement of gold. Thus, this nearest neighbor statistic
        provides strong evidence that tBid associates with
        mitochondrial contact sites.
      
      
        Discussion
        Mitochondria are compartmentalized into three spaces by
        their inner and outer membranes [ 17 ] . The outer membrane
        surrounds the mitochondria and separates it from the
        cytosol. The inner and outer membranes unite to form
        mitochondrial contact sites with protein composition that
        is still being defined [ 18 ] . It is important to test
        association of tBid with contact sites using electron
        microscopy because whereas purification schemes are based
        on assumptions about what contact sites should contain (and
        sometimes arrived at close to 100 proteins), these sites
        have always been defined structurally. As previously noted,
        contact sites are purported to have a unique lipid
        environment that is rich in cardiolipin. The presence of
        cardiolipin has been implicated in the function of numerous
        mitochondrial proteins including, sites I and III of the
        electron transport chain, the adenine nucleotide
        transporter, the protein translocation machinery, and the
        localization of mitochondrial creatine kinase [ 19 20 21 22
        ] .
        tBid 
        G94E was used predominantly for testing
        the hypothesis of localization of tBid to contact sites.
        Although this mutant translocates to mitochondria as
        efficiently as does the WT with diminished disruptive
        effect on the outer membrane, it seems conceivable that
        tBid harbors two distinct signals, one for translocation to
        mitochondria, and the other for interaction with proteins
        or lipids to exert its pro-apoptotic function. Disruption
        of this latter signal via mutation might alter tBid's
        submitochondrial localization, while preserving the outer
        membrane. We showed that WT tBid was not randomly localized
        with respect to contact sites. The mean experimental
        distance between gold particles and contact sites (53 nm;
        see table 1), though, was significantly higher than those
        values for tBid 
        G94E (23-31 nm; table 1). This increased
        distance for WT tBid is likely due to two factors that
        affect the visualization of contact sites. First, tBid may
        have degraded the outer membrane, so that the nearest
        contact site is not always recognized as such. Second, the
        streaking caused by reconstructing the 10-nm gold particles
        used for WT tBid labeling may have obscured the nearest
        contact site in a few instances. Hence, whereas our
        analysis cannot disprove the hypothesis that by mutating
        tBid its submitochondrial localization was changed, it
        seems more likely that the greater value for WT tBid is
        caused by the factors mentioned above. Thus, it appears
        that the conclusion of tBid localization to contact sites
        can be applied more generally than the narrow
        interpretation of tBid 
        G94E localization only.
        Truncated Bid, as other BH3-only proteins, requires
        another protein such as Bax or Bak to exert its
        pro-apoptotic function [ 23 24 ] . Interestingly, tBid was
        found associated with mitochondrial contact sites (Figs.
        1and 2) and was shown to destabilize lipid membranes in
        vitro (along with Bax) by increasing the permeabilization
        of artificial liposomes [ 25 26 ] . Therefore it is
        possible that tBid can bind to the cardiolipin rich contact
        site membranes and destabilize them by inducing Bax or Bak
        to oligomerize. The membrane destabilization may cause a
        secondary effect of inhibiting the action of the proteins
        located there. This hypothesis would account for how tBid
        affects the function of many different processes without
        binding directly to several proteins. Indeed it was found
        that the targeting of tBid to mitochondria-like membranes
        occurs in the absence of proteins, yet depends upon
        cardiolipin being in a possibly unique structure as opposed
        to free cardiolipin [ 9 ] . The requirement for a specific
        cardiolipin structure that is likely defined by the contact
        site is consistent with our observation that no gold
        particles were found in regions stripped of the outer
        membrane exposing the cardiolipin-rich inner membrane.
        After the induction of apoptosis, mitochondria display
        two distinct phases of damage. Early in the process the
        outer membrane becomes permeable, without rupture (Although
        this is controversial [ 27 ] .), to several proteins found
        in the mitochondrial inner membrane space including
        cytochrome c, in which contact sites have a probable role [
        28 ] . During this early phase, though, the inner membrane
        remains intact and mitochondria still retain their protein
        import machinery [ 29 ] . Later in the process there is
        swelling and herniation of the matrix leading to a
        distension of the cristae [ 8 30 ] .
        Many factors could contribute to the structural changes
        observed in mitochondria. tBid and other pro-death proteins
        such as Bax or Bak could destabilize the membrane leading
        to the observed changes. Additionally loss of contact site
        and inner membrane integrity could indirectly cause
        alterations in ion exchange and lead to the flow of water
        into the matrix. The loss of cytochrome c causes a break in
        the electron transfer chain resulting in the production of
        reactive oxygen species [ 31 ] . Reactive oxygen species
        are known to cause the oxidation and loss of function of
        many lipids including cardiolipin [ 20 ] . Finally,
        caspases activated downstream of cytochrome c release have
        been implicated in mitochondrial damage [ 29 ] . It appears
        likely that the cumulative damage of these agents could
        lead to the irreversible loss of mitochondrial membrane
        integrity and structure.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In conclusion, we have combined the techniques of
        immunogold microscopy and electron tomography to determine
        visually and by statistical analysis that tBid is
        preferentially concentrated at contact sites rather than
        being randomly distributed along the outer membrane. For
        the first time, immunogold electron tomography permitted a
        quantitative demonstration of 3-D organellar protein
        labeling with antibodies. The method described is
        envisioned to broaden biological applications of
        ultrastructural immunogold labeling techniques especially
        in investigations dealing with compartmentalization of
        functional elements. For example, many organelles,
        including the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi
        apparatus, have a complex organization with a unique
        distribution of proteins throughout each. Immunoelectron
        tomography is starting to be a useful tool in determining
        how the distribution of proteins may provide clues as to
        their targets or scope of action [ 32 ] .
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Generation of Bid and caspase 8 proteins
          Full length human Bid and caspase 8 cDNA were obtained
          as described (Luo et al 1998). A three myc-tag
          recognizing the sequence EQKLISEEDL was placed into
          position 67 in the cDNA of full length Bid. A point
          mutation changing glycine 94 to glutamic acid was made
          into three-myc Bid using the primers
          5'-GCCCAGGTCGAGGACAGCATG-3' and
          5'-CATGCTGTCCTCGACCTGGGC-3' using standard techniques.
          Both vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
          Bacterially expressed proteins were made as previously
          described [ 3 ] .
        
        
          Preparation of mitochondria for immunogold electron
          microscopy
          Mouse liver mitochondria were prepared fresh and
          treated with 1 ng myc-tagged tBid 
          G94E / 100 μg of mitochondrial
          protein. Mitochondria were then washed 2X in mitochondria
          isolation buffer (MIB, 250 mM mannitol, 5 mM HEPES pH
          7.2, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin)
          and weakly fixed with fresh 1% paraformaldehyde in MIB
          for 15 min on ice. Mitochondria were pelleted (in all
          steps at 10,000 x g for 3 min at 4°C) and resuspended in
          blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 1% normal goat
          serum, 1% cold water fish gelatin, 0.04% glycine in MIB)
          for 15 min on ice. They were then pelleted and
          resuspended in working buffer (blocking buffer diluted 10
          x in MIB) containing the primary antibody, anti-myc
          (1:1000) for 1 hr on ice. The no-primary control omitted
          the previous step only. A second control consisted of
          replacing the primary antibody with an excess of tBid 
          G94E and continuing as with the
          primary antibody. Mitochondria were washed 4 x 4 min in
          working buffer and incubated with the indicated
          anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to 10-nm (used
          for wild-type tBid) or to 5-nm (used for tBid 
          G94E ) gold beads (1:50 Amersham) for
          1 hr on ice in working buffer. Subsequently, they were
          washed 4 x 4 min with working buffer to remove unbound
          secondary antibody and rinsed 1 x in cacodylate buffer
          (0.1 M sodium cacodylate. Electron Microscopy Sciences,
          Ft. Washington, PA).
          Mitochondria were centrifuged and the pellet was kept
          intact for all remaining steps. The mitochondrial pellets
          were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer for
          one hour on ice and rinsed 3 x 4 min in cacodylate
          buffer. The mitochondrial pellets were incubated with 1%
          osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in
          cacodylate buffer for one hour on ice, followed by
          rinsing 3 x 4 min in ice-cold double-distilled water. The
          pellets were dehydrated using a successive ethanol series
          of 20, 50, 70, and 90% in double distilled water for 10
          min each on ice. The pellets were further dehydrated at
          room temperature 2 x in 100% ethanol for 5 min and 2 x in
          100% acetone for 5 min each.
          Pellets were transferred to glass scintillation vials
          for resin (Durcupan ACM, EMS) infiltration. The pellets
          were first incubated in a sequence of 70% ethanol/30%
          resin, 50% ethanol/50% resin, and 30% ethanol/70% resin
          for 30 min each at room temperature. Pellets were then
          infiltrated 3 x 1 hr in 3 ml of 100% resin. After the
          final incubation, the resin-infiltrated pellet plus
          excess resin were poured into aluminum dishes and
          polymerized at 60°C for 36 hr.
        
        
          Electron microscopy and tomographic
          reconstructions
          Tomographic reconstructions were performed as
          described previously [ 13 ] . Briefly, thin-sectioned
          material (~80-nm thick) was examined using a JEOL 1200FX
          electron microscope. Thick-sectioned material was
          examined with a JEOL 4000EX microscope operating at 400
          keV. The 0.75 μm thick sections were tilted through 120°
          of rotation, and electron micrographs were taken in 2°
          increments. Using the SUPRIM software package, Four tilt
          series from different sections consisting of 61 tilt
          images each were then digitized, aligned, and back
          projected using R weighting to generate the volume
          information. Volume segmentation of the reconstructed
          mitochondria using Xvoxtrace software was used to
          delineate the inner boundary membrane, cristae, outer
          membrane, contact sites, and gold particles. This
          information was used to construct surface-rendered
          computer graphic representations using the SYNU software
          package. Gold particles were represented by gold spheres
          in the surface-rendered volume.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          To determine whether immunogold-labeled tBid is
          spatially clustered or randomly located about contact
          sites, a spatial point pattern statistics was used,
          namely, the nearest neighbor statistic [ 16 ] . The
          Euclidean distances from each immunogold particle to all
          of the contact sites in the reconstruction was calculated
          for all the particles using a similar approach to that
          described by Perkins and coworkers [ 13 ] . The nearest
          neighbor statistic was calculated for the reconstruction
          using the closest observed contact site to each gold
          particle and then calculating the mean and standard
          deviation for all such measurements in a reconstructed
          mitochondrion. These values were compared with those
          derived from simulations in which the same number of gold
          particles determined empirically were randomly placed on
          the mitochondrial surface.
