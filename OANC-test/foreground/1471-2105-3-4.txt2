        Expression profiling is an emerging experimental method
        whereby RNA accumulation in cells and tissues can be
        assayed for many thousands of genes simultaneously in a
        single experiment. There are two common experimental
        platforms for expression profiling; redundant
        oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix GeneChips) [ 1 ] , and
        spotted cDNA microarrays [ 2 3 4 ] . The Affymetrix
        GeneChips have the inherent advantages of redundancy,
        specificity, and transportability; there are typically
        30-40 oligonucleotide probes (features) designed against
        each gene tested by the array, with paired perfect-match
        and mismatch probes, with standardized factory synthesis of
        arrays [ 5 6 ] . The uniform nature of the arrays permits
        databasing of individual profiles, which facilitates
        comparison of data generated by different laboratories.
        Expression profiling has led to dramatic advances in
        understanding of yeast biology, where homogeneous cultures
        can be grown and exposed to timed environmental variables [
        7 8 9 10 11 12 ] . Such studies have led to the rapid
        assignment of function to a large number of anonymous gene
        sequences. Large-scale expression profiling studies of
        tissues from higher vertebrates are more challenging, due
        to the higher complexity of the genome, larger related gene
        families, and incomplete genomic resources. Nevertheless,
        DNA microarrays have been successfully applied in the
        analysis of aging and caloric restriction [ 13 ] and
        pulmonary fibrosis [ 14 ] . And many publications,
        particularly on cancer, have appeared [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 ]
        . Affymetrix has recently announced the availability of the
        U133 GeneChip series with 33,000 well-characterized human
        genes mined from genomic sequence. The nearly complete
        ascertainment of genes in the human genome should make
        expression-profiling studies of human tissues particularly
        powerful. However, identification of the sources of
        experimental variability, and knowledge of the relative
        contribution of variation from each source, is critical for
        appropriate experimental design in expression profiling
        experiments.
        Mills and Gordon recently studied the relative
        contribution of experimental variability of probe
        production on the reproducibility of microarray results
        using mixed murine tissue RNA on Affymetrix Mu11K GeneChips
        [ 20 ] . In their study, the same RNA preparation was used
        as a template for distinct cDNA/cRNA amplifications and
        hybridizations. An additional variable studied was the
        effect of different laboratories processing the same RNAs.
        The authors found relatively poor concordance between
        duplicate arrays, with an average of 12% increase/decrease
        calls between the same RNA processed in parallel and
        hybridized to two Mu11K-A microarrays. The authors
        concluded that there was substantial experimental
        variability in the experimental procedure, necessitating
        extensive filtering and large numbers of arrays to detect
        accurate gene expression changes (LUT: look-up tables) [ 20
        ] . In our laboratory, we have processed over 1,200
        Affymetrix arrays, and have found significantly higher
        experimental reproducibility (R 2= 0.979 for new generation
        U74A version 2 murine arrays or human U95 series, see
        Result and Discussion). In addition, a recent publication
        of a single human patient, where RNA was prepared from two
        distinct breast tumors, and placed on duplicate U95A
        GeneChips (four chips total) found a very low degree of
        experimental variability between microarrays (R 2= 0.995),
        and between the two tumors (R 2= 0.987) [ 21 ] . The marked
        differences in experimental variability between
        laboratories could be due to different quality control
        protocols (see http://microarray.cnmcresearch.org), newer
        more robust Affymetrix arrays now available (murine Mu11K
        versus U74A version 2 and new generation human U95 series),
        use of more recent algorithms for data interpretation, or
        due to more consistent processing of RNA, cDNA, and cRNA in
        the same laboratory.
        The previous studies did not systematically address the
        reproducibility of GeneChip hybridization (e.g. the same
        biotinylated cRNA on two different microarrays). In
        addition to lingering questions concerning variability due
        to specific experimental procedures, there are other
        possible sources of variability that have not yet been
        investigated, specifically tissue heterogeneity and
        inter-individual variation. The latter two sources of
        variability are particularly important in human expression
        profiling studies. The study of human tissues often
        involves the use of tissue biopsies, where a relatively
        limited region of an organ is sampled. Tissue heterogeneity
        and sampling error might be expected to introduce
        significant variability in expression profiles. Second,
        tissues may derive from individuals from different ethnic
        backgrounds; humans are highly outbred, leading to the
        potential of significant polymorphic noise (herein called
        "SNP noise") between individuals unrelated to the disease
        or variable under study. SNP noise also exists between
        different inbred mouse strains, and some experiments have
        normalized this effect by breeding the same mutation on
        different strains, and profiling each individually [ 22 ] .
        Knowledge of the relative effect of each experimental,
        tissue, and patient variable on expression profiling
        results in humans is important, so that appropriate
        experimental designs can be employed.
        We recently reported the design and production of a
        highly redundant oligonucleotide microarray for analysis of
        human muscle biopsies (Borup et al. 
        submitted ). This MuscleChip contains
        4,601 probe sets corresponding to 3,369 distinct genes and
        ESTs expressed in human muscle. Each probe set contains
        between 16 to 40 oligonucleotides, such that the number of
        specific oligonucleotide probes on the array was
        138,000.
        Here, we utilize this MuscleChip to investigate the
        relative significance of variables affecting expression
        profiling data and interpretation. Specifically, we studied
        the correlation coefficients of profiles considering the
        following variables: 1. variation due to probe production
        (same RNA); 2. variation due to the microarray itself (same
        cRNA on different GeneChips); 3. tissue heterogeneity
        (different regions of the same muscle biopsy); 4.
        inter-patient variability (SNP noise); 5. diagnosis
        (underlying pathological variable); and 6. patient age.
        We have recently reported generation of expression
        profiling results using mixed patient samples [ 23 ] . Our
        hypothesis was that mixing of RNA samples from multiple
        regions of muscle biopsies, and from multiple patients
        matched for most variables (disease, age, sex), would
        effectively normalize both intra-patient variability
        (tissue heterogeneity), and inter-patient variability (SNP
        noise; e.g. normal human polymorphic variation unrelated to
        the primary defect). Here, we test this hypothesis
        directly, and show that sample mixing does indeed result in
        relatively high sensitivity and specificity for gene
        expression changes that would be detected by many
        individual expression profiles. Thus, sample mixing appears
        to be an appropriate first-pass method to obtain the most
        significant expression changes, while using small numbers
        of arrays.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        Fifty six (56) different RNA samples were prepared from
        different regions of muscle biopsies from 28 individuals
        (15 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients, 13 normal
        controls). The profiles of five of the DMD patients and the
        five controls have been previously reported using the
        Affymetrix HuFL microarray [ 23 ] ; however, we re-tested
        these same samples on the custom MuscleChip (Borup et al. 
        submitted ) for comparison to the
        other patients here. All RNAs were converted to
        double-stranded cDNA, and then to biotinylated cRNA. The
        cRNAs were then hybridized to the MuscleChip either singly,
        in mixed groups, or both, as described below. In total, 34
        hybridizations were performed, scanned, and the data
        statistically analyzed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite
        and Excel. Quality control criteria were as described on
        our web site ( http://microarray.cnmcresearch.org, link to
        "programs in genomic applications"), and included
        sufficient cRNA amplification, and adequate
        post-hybridization scaling factors. Scaling factors
        (normalization needed to reach a common target intensity)
        ranged from 0.46 to 3.28 (Table 1). All raw image files,
        processed image files, and difference analyses are posted
        on a web-queried SQL database interface to our Affymetrix
        LIMS Oracle warehouse (see
        http://microarray.cnmcresearch.org: link to "programs in
        genomic applications", "data", "human").
        Among the 4,601 probe sets on the Affymetrix custom
        muscle microarray, we found a consistent percentage of
        "present" calls for each of the 34 cRNA samples tested
        (Duchenne dystrophy, 28 arrays, 48.2% ± 6.1%; controls 6
        arrays, 53.3% ± 1.4%). To test for inter-array variability,
        two different hybridization solutions were applied to
        duplicate arrays, and correlation coefficients determined.
        A high correlation coefficient was found in this analysis,
        suggesting that inter-array variability of the MuscleChip
        used was a relatively minor variable (Patient 3 a and
        3a-duplicate R 2= 0.96 and percent shared [No Change (NC)]
        calls by Microarray Suite software was 99%; Patient 3b and
        3b-duplicate R 2= 0.98 and percent NC was 98%; Table 1).
        The high reproducibility of Affymetrix array results is
        consistent with other data in our laboratory, and from
        previously published data [ 6 21 23 24 ] , and shows that
        experimental variability associated with hybridization and
        scanning of highly redundant oligonucleotide GeneChips is
        not a major source of experimental variability.
        Given the previous report suggesting that the conversion
        of RNA to biotinylated cRNA probe was a major source of
        variability in murine array experiments [ 20 ] , we tested
        a series of murine RNA from different sources, using the
        newer generation U74Av2 GeneChips. One series of samples
        was from murine spleens, where spleens from multiple
        animals for each variable under study were mixed, RNA
        isolated, RNA samples split, and duplicate cDNA, cRNA, and
        hybridizations processed in parallel for each RNA (Fig. 1,
        "KNagaraju" samples). We also compared RNAs processed from
        parallel murine myogenic cell cultures (Fig. 1, "VSM"
        samples), where each profile was from a different cell
        culture. Finally, we used a series of murine muscle tissues
        from normal and dystrophin-deficient mice, where each
        profile was from a different series of complete
        gastrocnemius muscles (Fig. 1, "FBooth" samples). The data
        from these 42 murine U74Av2 profiles were then analyzed by
        unsupervised clustering [ 25 ] to determine which profiles
        were most closely related to each other (Fig. 1). This
        analysis shows that the different sources of RNA cluster
        together, as expected. Importantly, the same RNA used as a
        template for two distinct cDNA/cRNA preparations and
        hybridizations showed a high correlation coefficient (R 2=
        0.99 for five of the six samples, with average R 2= 0.978)
        (Fig. 1). The large muscle group profiles (FBooth samples)
        showed excellent correlation, both with respect to
        diagnosis; however here there was no sampling error as the
        entire muscle group was used rather than isolated biopsies.
        Finally, the parallel tissue culture experiments (VSM
        samples) showed greater variability between duplicates,
        suggesting that tissue culture conditions may be more
        subject to variability than 
        in vivo tissues (Fig. 1). This murine
        data shows that variability from different cDNA-cRNA
        reactions is very low (R 2= 0.978).
        To analyze the impact of intra-patient variability
        (tissue heterogeneity), inter-patient variability
        (polymorphic noise in outbred populations), and the effect
        of sample mixing on the sensitivity of detection of gene
        expression differences between patient groups, we conducted
        a series of individual and mixed profiling (Table 1).
        Muscle biopsies from five 4-6 yr old DMD patients, and five
        10-12 yr old patients were selected, each biopsy split into
        two parts, and RNA isolated independently from each of the
        20 biopsy fragments. For these ten DMD patients, the two
        different regions of the same biopsy were expression
        profiled both individually (20 profiles), and also mixed
        into four pools where each pool originated from distinct
        RNA samples (Table 1). The resulting profiles were also
        compared to previously reported mixed 6-9 yr old DMD
        patient cRNAs, and mixed 6-9 yr old control cRNAs [ 23 ] ,
        as mentioned above.
        As an initial statistical analysis, we used Affymetrix
        software to define genes that showed expression changes
        (Increased, Decreased or Marginal) in expression levels
        between pairs of profiles (difference analyses). This
        method of data interpretation showed that some muscle
        biopsies showed very little variance between different
        regions of the same biopsy, while other patient biopsies
        showed considerable variability (see Fig. 2for
        representative scatter graphs). Expressing this variance as
        a percentage of "Diff Calls" between the two regions of the
        same biopsy, as determined by Affymetrix default
        algorithms, we found considerable variability in the
        similarity of profiles, with values ranging from 1.5% to
        18% of the 4,601 probe sets studied (4.99% ± 4.94%). This
        data suggests that tissue heterogeneity (intra-patient
        variability) can be a major source of variation in
        expression profiling experiments, even when using
        relatively large pieces (50 mg) of relatively homogeneous
        tissues (such as muscle).
        The most common strategy for interpreting Affymetrix
        microarray data is to use two profile comparisons, with an
        arbitrary threshold for "significant fold-change" in
        expression levels. Typically, multiple arrays are compared,
        with those gene expression changes showing the most
        consistent fold changes prioritized, although other methods
        have been reported [ 13 22 26 27 ] . To study inter-patient
        variability, we defined the gene expression changes
        surviving four pairwise comparisons with mixed control
        samples, as we have previously described [ 23 ] . Briefly,
        four comparisons were done by Affymetrix software (eg. DMD
        1a versus control 1a; DMD 1a versus control 1b; DMD1b
        versus control 1a; DMD1b versus control 1b). The four data
        sets were then compared, with only those gene expression
        changes that showed >2-fold change in all four
        comparisons (four comparison survival method). The number
        of surviving diff calls by this method ranged from 250 to
        463 (355 ± 80) (Table 1). Interestingly, those patients
        showing considerable variation between different regions of
        the same biopsy did not show a corresponding decrease in
        the number of gene expression changes surviving the
        iterative comparisons to controls (Table 1). This suggests
        (but does not prove) the most significant changes might be
        shared, independent of tissue variability (see below).
        A different statistical method to determine the effect
        of the different variables under study is to perform
        hierarchical cluster analysis using nearest neighbor
        statistical methods [ 25 ] . Here, we subjected all
        profiles to unsupervised cluster analysis, as a means of
        determining which variables had the greatest effect (e.g.
        intra-patient variability [different regions of biopsy],
        versus diagnosis [DMD vs control], versus inter-patient
        variability [DMD patients in same age group], versus age of
        patient). For this analysis, we used the fluorescence
        intensity of each probe set (Average difference), after
        data scrubbing to remove genes that showed expression
        levels near background ("Absent" Calls) for all profiles
        (Fig. 3). This analysis shows that duplicate profiles of
        the same cRNA hybridization solution are the most highly
        related (Patient 3 a and duplicate (3a-d); 3b and duplicate
        (3b-d)), consistent with the high correlation found by the
        comparisons using Affymetrix Microarray Suite software
        described above. Again, this reflects the low amount of
        combined experimental variability intrinsic to the
        laboratory processing of RNA, cDNA, cRNA and
        hybridization.
        When comparing two different regions of the same biopsy
        [intra-patient variability], we found widely varying
        results, depending on the patient studied (Fig. 3). For
        example, some individual patients showed very closely
        related profiles that approached the similarity of
        duplicate arrays on the same cRNA (Fig. 2; profiles 6a, 6b;
        10a, 10b). On the other hand, some patients showed very
        distantly related profiles for two regions of the same
        biopsy (Fig. 3; profiles 1a, 1b; 4a, 4b; 9a, 9b).
        Importantly, the variation caused by intra-patient tissue
        variation often overshadowed all other variables. For
        example, a profile from DMD patient 9 (9a) clustered with
        the normal controls, rather than with the other DMD
        patients (Fig. 3). The histopathology of this patient was
        noted as being unusually variable in severity prior to
        expression profiling. Also, unsupervised clustering was
        unable to group patients of similar ages, despite DMD
        showing a progressive clinical course. We conclude that
        intra-patient tissue heterogeneity is a major source of
        experimental variability in expression profiling, and must
        be considered in experimental design.
        The above findings suggested that both intra-patient
        variability (tissue heterogeneity) and inter-patient
        variability (polymorphic noise) had major effects on the
        expression profiles. One method to control for these
        sources of noise is to analyze large numbers of profiles,
        both on multiple patients, and on multiple regions of
        tissue from each patient. This would allow determinations
        of p values and statistical significance for a single
        controlled variable under study (e.g. DMD vs controls). An
        alternative method is to experimentally normalize these
        variables through mixing of samples from patient groups;
        such mixing would be expected to average out both intra-
        and inter-patient variation. The expectation is that the
        most significant and dramatic gene expression changes would
        still be identified, while using many less profiles (and
        thus a substantial reduction in cost of the analyses).
        To test for the relative sensitivity of interpretation
        of sample mixing versus individual profiles, we mixed
        together the 10 cRNAs for the two different age groups of
        DMD patients (samples 1a - 5b; samples 6a - 10b). For this
        analysis, we also generated expression profiles for two
        additional groups of control individuals. One was a second
        set of five normal male biopsies ages 5-12 yrs (controls
        2a, 2b), and the third control set was three normal
        age-matched female biopsies ages 4-13 yrs (controls 3a, 3b)
        (Fig. 4). As with the original male control group (control
        1a, 1b), two different regions of each biopsy were
        processed independently through the biotinylated cRNA step,
        and then equimolar amounts of cRNA mixed for hybridization
        to the MuscleChip.
        All 34 profiles (both individual and mixed samples) were
        again analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering
        (Fig. 4) [ 25 ] . As described above, we scrubbed the
        profiles to eliminate all genes showing expression levels
        consistently at or below background hybridization
        intensities by requiring each gene to show a "Present Call"
        in one or more of the 34 profiles.
        As above, duplicate profiles using the same cRNA
        hybridization solution on different arrays, whether mixed
        or individual samples, showed very highly correlated
        results (very low branch on dendrogram) (Fig. 4; mix 5-6
        yrs, mix 10-12 yrs; patient 3a/3a-d; patient 3b/3b-d). As
        above, this indicates that experimental variability from
        laboratory procedures or different arrays is a relatively
        minor factor in interpretation of results. Mixed samples
        from different regions of the same biopsies showed the
        same, or only slightly more variation (mixed controls c1,
        c2, and c3, mixed DMD 6-9 yrs). This showed that sample
        mixing does indeed average out tissue heterogeneity
        (intra-patient variability), as well as inter-patient
        variability. We noted that all of the controls (both male
        and female) clustered in the same branch of the dendrogram,
        while the four of the six mixed DMD profiles clustered just
        one level away from the controls, separately from the other
        DMD profiles. This analysis suggests that there is
        considerable variability in the progressive tissue
        pathology induced by dystrophin deficiency, both within a
        patient, and between patients.
        To test the sensitivity and specificity of sample mixing
        versus individual profiling, we defined differentially
        expressed genes using a two group t-test (GeneSpring [ 28
        29 ] ), comparing all 6 mixed control profiles and the 10
        individual 5-6 yr old DMD profiles. Genes were retained
        that met specific p value thresholds between the two sets
        of profiles. In parallel, we compared the two corresponding
        mixed 5-6 yr old DMD profiles to the same 6 mixed control
        profiles.
        Comparison of 10 individual 5-6 yr Duchenne dystrophy
        profiles to 6 mixed controls revealed 1,498 genes showing
        differential expression with p < 0.05 (Fig. 5).
        Comparison of the two mixed Duchenne dystrophy profiles to
        the 6 mixed controls showed 1,350 genes with p < 0.05
        (Fig. 5A). Comparison of the two gene lists showed that 61%
        of differentially regulated genes detected by the 10
        individual profiles were also detected by the two mixed
        profiles. This suggests that the sensitivity and
        specificity of using mixed samples is approximately half
        that of individual profiles. However, there was a rapid
        shift in specificity and sensitivity as stringency of the
        analysis was increased. Raising the statistical threshold
        to p < 0.0001 for individual profiles, while keeping the
        threshold for mixed profiles at p < 0.05 as required by
        the small number of data points (Fig. 5B), resulted in a
        sensitivity of 86% for mixed samples (351 of 408 genes p
        < 0.0001 detected). In conclusion, mixing detected about
        two thirds of statistically significant changes (p <
        0.05). Mixing was a relatively sensitive method of
        detecting the most highly significant changes (p <
        0.0001) (86% of changes detected), however it was not very
        specific; as many as one third of gene expression changes
        showing p < 0.05 in mixed samples were not confirmed by
        individual profiles.
        Use of t-test measurements is expected to contain
        significant amounts of noise, due to the very large number
        of comparisons involved in array studies; a value of p =
        0.05 means that as many as 5% of gene expression changes
        are expected to be identified by "chance", and thereby not
        reflect true differences between samples. We have
        previously reported a very simple, yet potentially more
        stringent method for data analysis of small numbers of
        expression profiles, using duplicate profiles for control
        and experimental samples, and then identifying those genes
        that show consistent changes >2-fold in the four
        possible pair-wise data comparisons (four comparison
        survival method) [ 23 ] . A similar pair-wise comparison
        method, using a less stringent average fold-change
        analysis, was recently reported for muscle from aging and
        calorie-restricted mouse muscle [ 13 ] .
        To investigate the validity of this approach we compared
        the sensitivity and specificity of t-test detection of
        expression changes versus the four-pairwise survival
        method. Two sample t-test of the 10 individual Duchenne
        dystrophy profiles compared to the 6 mixed control profiles
        revealed 1,498 genes showing p < 0.05 as above. In
        parallel, the mixed DMD duplicate profiles were compared to
        a single pair of mixed control sample profiles (c1a, c1b),
        using the pairwise comparison survival method [ 23 ] .
        Briefly, four comparisons were done (DMD 1a versus control
        1a; DMD1b versus control 1a; DMD 1a versus control 1b;
        DMD1b versus control 1b), and only those genes retained
        which showed >2-fold change in all four comparisons.
        This method was indeed considerably more specific in
        identifying significant (p < 0.05) gene expression
        changes (Fig. 6A) with 85% of gene expression changes in
        the mixed profiles verified by individual profiles (p <
        0.05). The sensitivity of this method depended on the
        p-value threshold for the individual profiles, but only
        reached a maximum of 49% sensitivity at p < 0.0001 (Fig.
        6B).
        The results above suggested that analysis of mixed
        samples using t-test methods was relatively sensitive but
        non-specific, while analysis of the same mixed profiles by
        2-fold survival method was relatively specific but
        insensitive. To confirm this conclusion, we directly
        compared the sensitivity and specificity of the four
        pairwise comparison method to more standard t-test methods
        (Fig. 7A). We found that the pairwise survival method was
        indeed highly specific, with 97% of changes identified by
        this method also detected by t-test. However, as predicted,
        it was not very sensitive, with only 30% of the expression
        changes with p < 0.05 identified by t-test being
        detected by the pairwise survival method. Comparison of all
        three analysis methods showed that many (349) genes
        expression changes were detected by all three methods (Fig.
        7B).
      
      
        Conclusions
        Microarray data analyses have been criticized as being
        "quite elusive about measurement reproducibility" [ 30 ] .
        This is largely the consequence of the large number of
        uncontrolled or unknown variables, and the prohibitive cost
        of isolating and investigating each variable. Here, we
        report the systematic isolation and study of most variables
        in microarray experiments using Affymetrix oligonucleotide
        arrays and human tissue biopsies. We found that all sources
        of experimental variability were quite minor (microarray R
        2= 0.98-0.99; probe synthesis + microarray R 2= 0.98-0.99).
        On the other hand, tissue heterogeneity (intra-patient
        variation; Average R 2for 10 patients = 0.92 [0.85 to
        0.98]), and differences between individual patients (SNP
        noise; Average R 2= 0.76 [0.42 to 0.93]) were major sources
        of variability in expression profiling. Thus, tissue
        heterogeneity and SNP noise have a high potential to
        obscure sought after condition-specific gene expression
        changes, particularly in humans, where tissue samples can
        be limiting (sampling error), and inter-individual
        variation often is very large. We have shown that mixing of
        patient samples effectively normalizes much of the intra-
        and inter-patient noise, while still identifying the
        majority of the most significant gene expression changes
        that would have been detected by larger numbers of
        individual patient profiles. Our results suggest that
        stringent yet robust data can be generated by mixing a
        small number of individuals with a defined condition (n =
        5), preferably using different regions of tissue for
        duplicate arrays. Controls should be similarly processed.
        The resulting four arrays (2 controls, 2 experimental
        datasets) should then be subjected to the >2-fold
        survival method, as previously described [ 23 ] . This will
        yield a stringent set of expression changes that are likely
        to be verified by larger studies with individual arrays,
        but at low cost as only four arrays are employed. The
        preliminary data from just four mixed profiles (two
        experimental and two control) can then be used to generate
        functional clusters and pathophysiological models. These
        preliminary models can then direct more hypothesis-driven
        experiments, or more extensive expression profiling
        studies.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Expression profiling
          Human muscle biopsy samples were diagnostic specimens
          flash-frozen immediately after surgery in isopentane
          cooled in liquid nitrogen, with storage in small,
          airtight, humidified tubes at -80°C until RNA isolation.
          Duchenne muscular dystrophy patient samples were all
          shown to have complete lack of dystrophin by
          immunostaining and/or immunoblot analysis, and were shown
          to have excellent morphology and preservation of tissue.
          Controls included groups of males and female (age
          described in text) that showed no histopathological
          abnormality, normal dystrophy proteins, and normal serum
          creatine kinase levels. Biopsy sizes ranged from 50 mg to
          2 grams, with approximately 20-30 mg used for RNA
          isolation (~10-15 micrograms of total RNA). As described
          in the text, all biopsies had two different regions of
          the same biopsy expression profiled separately.
          Details concerning the murine profiles will be
          published elsewhere. In this report, we used the murine
          profiles simply to test the sources of variation during
          sample preparation prior to hybridization to
          oligonucleotides.
          RNA isolation (Trizol, Gibco BRL), RNA purification
          (RNAeasy, Qiagen), cDNA synthesis and biotinylated cRNA
          were all done as per standard protocols provided by
          Affymetrix Inc. Quality control methods are described on
          our web site (
          http://microarray.cnmcresearch.org/pga.htm), with cRNA
          amplifications of between 5- and 13-fold for each of the
          samples. Ten micrograms of gel-verified fragmented
          biotinylated cRNA were hybridized to each MuscleChip or
          U74A v2 array, and scanning done after
          biotin/avidin/phycoerythrin amplification. Details on the
          specific patients studied, and details for each GeneChip
          (scaling factors, number of present calls, percentage
          difference calls between each duplicate sample, number of
          difference calls surviving four pair-wise comparisons of
          duplicate chips) is provided (Table 1). All profiling
          data presented here is available on our web site (
          http://microarray.CNMCResearch.org; data link), as image
          (.dat), absolute analysis (.chp), and ASCII text
          conversions of .chp (.txt) for each individual profile
          (see http://microarray.cnmcresearch.org/pga.htmfor file
          descriptions and use).
        
        
          Bio-informatic methods
          Absolute analysis (average difference determinations
          for each probe set) was done using Affymetrix default
          parameters. As described in the text, data was analyzed
          using a variety of methods, including unsupervised
          nearest-neighbor hierarchical clustering analyses
          (GeneSpring [ 28 29 ] [Silicon Genetics], and Cluster [
          25 ] [Stanford University]), t-test (GeneSpring) and
          four-comparison survival method [ 23 ] . The Cluster and
          Tree View software were download from
          http://rana.lbl.govand installed on an NT
          workstation.
