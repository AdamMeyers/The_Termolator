        Expression microarrays provide a vehicle for exploring
        the gene expression in a manner that is rapid, sensitive,
        systematic and comprehensive [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ] . Thousands of
        genes can now be studied simultaneously without the need of
        an 
        a priori candidate gene list. In
        order to keep up with advances in genome sequencing, the
        number and composition of representative gene sequences are
        frequently updated and probe sets representing newly
        discovered expressed sequences are added on commercial
        microarrays. Furthermore, existing probe sets are revised
        because probe sequences once thought to be unique for a
        single gene are occasionally found to be less specific.
        This leads to the question of whether results from newer
        microarray generations are comparable to those of previous
        generations. The cost, time and irreplaceable nature of
        some of the samples used for microarray analysis require
        that a method to compare data from different generations be
        developed.
        Although Affymetrix Chips can each measure the
        expression of over 12,000 genes and ESTs, the true
        transcript level is confounded by a substantial amount of
        noise and variability induced by both the large number of
        observations and the wide range of gene expression values [
        7 ] . Microarrays are sensitive to noise from many sources
        including the manufacturing process and the experimental
        (RNA isolation, labeling, hybridization, staining, washing
        and scanning) processes. Even within the same generation of
        chips and for replicates of single tissue samples, there
        may be substantial variability in the measurement levels
        for the same gene [ 8 ] . It is critical to distinguish
        this noise from the changes that are real. Many empirical
        approaches have been adopted to decrease noise from
        microarray based experiments. Different methodologies and
        strategies for reducing noise include establishing an
        arbitrary global threshold for fold-changes [ 9 ] ,
        noise-filtering look up tables [ 8 ] , normalization
        techniques to make microarrays comparable, such as using
        ANOVA methods to provide estimates of changes in gene
        expression that are corrected for potential confounding
        effects [ 10 11 ] , and using replicate experiments to
        estimate the variability in reported gene expression [ 12 ]
        . Applying fold change thresholds has been the most common
        method of reducing noise by filtering out the false
        positives [ 8 9 13 ] . However, much of the work done to
        date has focused on decreasing noise within the same
        generation and has not addressed the issue of comparability
        across generations.
        In this analysis, we have estimated the level of
        congruency between corresponding probe sets on two
        generations of Affymetrix Chips, HuGeneFL (old) and HG-U95A
        (new). We aim to understand the characteristics that
        contribute to the systematic variability of the expression
        values for experiments performed on different generations
        of microarrays and extract features that would make them
        more comparable. Furthermore, we address the issue of
        variable scanner settings, since a ten-fold decrease in the
        photo-multiplier tube (PMT) settings of the scanner was
        another parameter introduced by Affymetrix in parallel to
        the new chip generation, and interfered with data
        comparability. More specifically, to expand the dynamic
        range of the expression assay, a reduction of the system
        amplification was recommended when using HG-U95A chips.
      
      
        Results
        In order to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of
        the experiments, as well as the effect of different scanner
        settings and different chip generations we performed the
        following types of comparisons. The labeled cRNA from a
        single sample was split in two, hybridized to two HG-U95A
        chips and both were scanned at "low gain" photo-multiplier
        tube (PMT) settings (Exp 1). The labeled cRNA from a sample
        was split, hybridized to two HG-U95A chips, one was scanned
        at "low gain" PMT settings, the other at "high gain"
        settings (Exp 2). The labeled cRNA from a sample was split,
        hybridized to two HuGeneFL chips, one was scanned at "low
        gain", the other at "high gain" (Exp 3). The labeled cRNA
        from one sample was split, hybridized to a HuGeneFL chip
        and a HG-U95A chip, the HuGeneFL scanned at "high gain" and
        the HG-U95A at "low gain" (Exp 4) according to
        manufacturer's recommendations.
        For the two HG-U95A chip-pairs, where each chip-pair was
        hybridized with a single tissue sample and scanned at the
        same "low gain" scanner setting, the correlations across
        all probe sets were greater than 0.99 (Exp1 in Table 1).
        Looking at the four HG-U95A chip-pairs in Exp 2, with one
        chip of each pair scanned at "high gain" and the other at
        "low gain" PMT settings, the correlation coefficients
        across all probe sets ranged from 0.756 to 0.872 (Table 1).
        The same analysis on the three HuGeneFL chip-pairs (with
        one of each pair scanned at "high gain" and the other at
        "low gain") resulted in the correlation coefficients across
        the 7,129 probe sets ranging between 0.904 and 0.947 (Exp
        3, Table 1). Finally, in the analysis of the 8,044 common
        probe sets between HuGeneFL chips (measured at "high gain")
        and HG-U95A chips (measured at "low gain"), the correlation
        coefficients ranged between 0.730 and 0.810 (Exp 4, Table
        1).
        The rest of the analyses focused solely on the
        measurements made on the seven samples split across the
        HuGeneFL at "high gain" and the HG-U95A chips at "low
        gain", as this is the most common comparison that will need
        to be made (Exp 4). The correlation between the gene
        expression values was computed for different subsets of
        probe sets based on i) the number of common probe pairs;
        ii) the number of 'P' calls assigned to every probe set;
        iii) the expression level of the genes on HuGeneFL
        chips.
        For the first analysis each subset consisted of probe
        sets with the same number of common probe pairs. The
        correlation coefficient (r) was calculated by plotting all
        the measurements on the HuGeneFL versus all the
        measurements on the HG-U95A for every subset. The number of
        common probe pairs within probe sets ranged from zero to 16
        (see Methods). The correlation improved as the number of
        common probe pairs increased (Figure 1). When probe sets
        had 1 or more probe pairs in common, r was greater than
        0.8, and for 14 or more probe pairs in common, r was more
        than 0.9.
        A second analysis was performed in a similar manner, by
        creating subsets based on the number of 'P' calls per probe
        set, across the 14 chips (7 HuGeneFL and 7 HG-U95A chips).
        The correlation coefficient increased for the genes as the
        number of 'P' calls increased (Figure 2).
        Based on the level of gene expression on the HuGeneFL
        chips, different groups were made for gene expression level
        ranging from, for example, -100,000 to -10,000, -10,000 to
        -1,000 and so on. The correlation across the two chips was
        computed for each of these groups (Figure 3). It was
        observed that the higher the reported gene expression level
        on the HuGeneFL chips, the higher the correlation of the
        gene expression values between HuGeneFL and HG-U95A
        chips.
        A chi-square analysis was done for all the probe sets on
        both generations to determine if the absolute calls made
        for the HuGeneFL chips were statistically independent from
        the absolute calls made for the HG-U95A chips. A
        three-by-three contingency table was constructed based on
        the absolute calls. The 113,050 pairs of calls (7 samples ×
        2 chip generations × 8,044 common probe sets) were placed
        into this contingency table and the chi-square value
        computed. The computed chi-square value was greater than
        the chi-square value at 0.01 significance level, giving
        sufficient confidence to reject the null hypothesis that
        the calls made for the HuGeneFL chips were independent from
        the calls made for the HG-U95A generation of Chips.
        The correlation coefficient was computed for each probe
        set across the two chip generations. There were seven pairs
        of expression values for each probe set and 8,044
        correlations corresponding to the 8,044 probe sets common
        to HuGeneFL and HG-U95A chips (Figure 4). 2,200 of the
        8,044 genes (27 %) had a negative correlation (i.e. r <
        0), indicating that the gene expression levels changed in
        opposite direction across generations (i.e. the more of a
        transcript reported by one generation, the less reported by
        the other generation) (see Table 3 [ Additional File 1] at
        http://www.chip.org/~ashish/Reproducibility/for the
        correlation coefficients between the probe sets of the two
        chip generations).
        In order to determine if high intensity can compensate
        for low number of matched probe pairs, correlation was
        computed for different intensity levels of HuGeneFL for
        probe sets with specific number of common probe pairs. For
        example, we looked at all the probe sets with 0 common
        probe pairs and computed correlations for different ranges
        of HuGeneFL intensity levels. It was observed that even for
        probe sets with low number of common probe pairs, the
        correlation between HuGeneFL and HG-U95A gene expression
        levels increased as the reported gene expression on
        HuGeneFL increased (Figure 5and 6).
        All the above described analysis was repeated using the
        Affymetrix MAS 5.0 algorithm. The obtained results were
        highly similar (see Additional Figures 7-10 at
        http://www.chip.org/~ashish/Reproducibility/). However,
        when using the MAS 5.0 algorithm, 2,637 of the 8,044 genes
        (32%) were negatively correlated.
      
      
        Discussion
        This work is focused on the comparison of HuGeneFL at
        "high gain" settings and HG-U95A settings at "low gain"
        settings. Although this comparison represents probe sets
        with the worst correlation coefficients, it was
        specifically chosen because most research labs tend to use
        HuGeneFL chips with the old scanner ("high gain") settings
        and HG-U95A chips with the new scanner ("low gain")
        settings, due to a change in Affymetrix recommendations.
        This represents the most common problem of comparability
        across the two generations.
        Many of the probe sets in the new generation of
        Affymetrix chips (HG-U95A) have been significantly modified
        from the corresponding probe sets in the older generation.
        These differences in the design of the probe sets are due
        to several factors, including corrections and additions
        made to the public databases and new techniques used in
        probe selection. Our aim was to determine the
        characteristics of the two chip generations that would
        account for the systematic variability in the gene
        expression values across them.
        The gene expression values for replicates of a
        particular tissue sample measured at the same scanner
        setting and on the same chip generation (HG-U95A) gave a
        very high correlation of 0.99 (Exp 1, Table 1). This
        indicates that expression measurements within one
        generation are highly reproducible. Therefore, any
        variation in gene expression levels across the two
        generations should be due to the chip technology itself and
        the specificity of the probe set sequences.
        The reproducibility of HG-U95A chips scanned at "high
        gain" and "low gain" scanner settings is poorer than the
        reproducibility of HuGeneFL chips at the two scanner
        settings. This lower correlation of HG-U95A chips at the
        two scanner settings could be attributed to the fact that
        HG-U95A chips have higher density of probe pairs than
        HuGeneFL chips, making them more sensitive to background
        noise. Furthermore, since the HG-U95A chips are more
        specific with respect to their sequence selection criteria,
        they would hybridize more efficiently than HuGeneFL chips
        and so would be more saturated at high scanner settings
        giving a lower correlation between "high gain" and "low
        gain" scanner settings. The experiment involving HG-U95A
        chips at "high gain" versus the HG-U95A at "low gain" had a
        higher correlation compared to the HuGeneFL at "high gain"
        versus the HG-U95A at "low gain" experiments (Table 1).
        This could be attributed to several factors. The different
        composition of probe pairs used for some probe set across
        generations could result in altered hybridization
        efficiency, and consequently different expression values
        for the corresponding genes. The different number of probe
        pairs per probe set in each generation could also introduce
        some variance since it alters the "sample size" on which
        all calculations are based. The higher density of probe
        cells in the HG-U95A chips means that probe pairs are
        closely packed, and perhaps affected in a different way
        than standard density chips by noise and background levels.
        Moreover, the probe pairs for each probe set are scattered
        over HG-U95A chips as opposed to being physically grouped
        together as on the HuGeneFL chips. This could result in a
        variable impact of background and noise on the expression
        value obtained for each probe set.
        Every probe set on HuGeneFL has a corresponding probe
        set on HG-U95A. However, not all the probe pairs within a
        probe set are common for the corresponding probe sets on
        both chip types. In this analysis, the correlation between
        probe sets increases as the number of common probe pairs
        increases (from zero to 16 probe pairs), with a correlation
        coefficient of 0.4 if there are no probe pairs in common
        and over 0.8 if even one probe pair is in common. The sharp
        increase of the correlation coefficient between probe sets
        with none and one common probe pairs, could be explained by
        the use of poor sequence selection criteria for the
        specific HuGeneFL probe sets, which later required the
        complete replacement of the probe set. The chi square value
        computed using the absolute calls given to each of the
        probe sets demonstrates that most probe sets (77%) were
        assigned the same absolute calls on both generations. Using
        the reproducibility of absolute calls as a measure of
        consistency across the two generations indicates that the
        two generations are consistent overall.
        The reproducibility of gene expression measurements
        across generations was higher for probe sets with higher
        gene expression measurements. To some extent, high
        expression levels appear to compensate for low numbers of
        common probe pairs between chip generations, with highest
        correlations reached when increased gene expression was
        combined with a large number of common probe pairs (Figure
        5and 6). This pattern was also evident when analyzing the
        number of 'P' calls for every probe set. More specifically,
        the correlation of absolute calls for every probe set,
        increased with increasing gene expression levels. Although
        the absolute calls are qualitative indicators of the
        presence of a transcript in a sample, they are derived from
        the intensities of individual probe pairs within the probe
        set. We propose that the increased reproducibility at
        higher expression levels is due to the decreased
        significance of the fixed measurement noise effect.
      
      
        Conclusions
        This paper gives a basic summary statistic of the
        comparison between different chip generations, as well as
        information on the extent to which this is possible. Being
        able to perform such comparisons is critical especially
        when tissue availability and financial limitations are an
        issue. Skeletal muscle was used for the purposes of this
        study, but any tissue can be used for the establishment of
        benchmarks depending on the specific interests of
        individual labs. Further study of more samples and tissue
        types could establish a widely applicable analytical model
        to make the most of current datasets and accelerate work
        with future microarray generations and platforms.
      
      
        Methods
        
          RNA extraction and hybridization
          Total RNA was extracted from normal human skeletal
          muscle tissue samples and used for cDNA and labeled cRNA
          synthesis as previously described [ 14 15 ] . The
          fragmented cRNA together with control targets recommended
          by Affymetrix were hybridized to the GeneChip of choice
          (HuGeneFL or HG-U95A). HuGeneFL chips contain
          oligonucleotide sequences representative of 5,600 genes.
          Each gene is represented by at least one probe set, which
          in turn consists of approximately 20 probe pairs. Each
          probe pair consists of two probe cells, the perfect match
          (PM) and the mismatch (MM). The former is complementary
          to, and interrogates the expression of a 25 base pair
          region of the gene sequence, while the latter contains a
          one-base change and is used to control for non-specific
          hybridization. HG-U95A chips contain probe sets, each
          consisting of approximately 16 probe pairs,
          representative of ~12,600 genes. All 5,600 measured by
          the HuGeneFL chips are also measured by the HG-U95A
          chips; however, in order to improve their sensitivity and
          specificity, the composition of some of the probe pairs
          has been changed.
        
        
          Signal detection and analysis
          The chips were incubated (16-17 hours, 45°C and 60
          rpm) in a rotating oven, washed by the Affymetrix
          Fluidics Station, using the recommended signal
          amplification step, and scanned by the Affymetrix
          Scanner. Two different scanner settings were used. "High
          gain" PMT) settings were recommended for HuGeneFL chips,
          and "low gain" PMT settings were introduced for the
          HG-U95A chips. Therefore most HuGeneFL chips were scanned
          using Affymetrix "high gain" settings and most HG-U95A
          chips were scanned using the "low gain" settings. In
          order to assess the influence of the "scanner settings"
          parameter in our data, some HuGeneFL chips were rescanned
          under "low gain" and some HG-U95A chips were rescanned
          under "high gain". A list of experiments and settings is
          presented in Table 2(the raw .CEL files for all these
          experiments can be accessed at
          http://www.chip.org/~ashish/Reproducibility/). Using the
          Affymetrix software (Microarray Suite 4.0), each probe
          set was assigned an "average difference" value
          corresponding to the expression level of the particular
          gene it represents. The calculated average difference was
          used as the measure of expression levels throughout this
          analysis. The analysis was repeated using the Affymetrix
          Microarray Suite 5.0 (MAS 5.0).
          Affymetrix software also assigns every probe set an
          "absolute call" (Present [P], Absent [A], Marginal [M]),
          which represents a qualitative indication of whether or
          not a transcript is detected within a sample. In the MAS
          4.0 algorithm these calls are determined using the
          following metrics: 1) the ratio of the number of positive
          probe pairs to the number of negative probe pairs (known
          as the Positive/Negative Ratio), 2) the fraction of
          positive probe pairs (Positive Fraction), and 3) the
          average across the probe set of each probe pair's log
          ratio of positive intensity over negative intensity (Log
          Average Ratio) (1).
          Affymetrix tables
          http://www.affymetrix.com/Auth/support/downloads/comparisons/PN600444HumanFLComp.zipindicate
          that 6,623 probe sets from HuGeneFL chip have been mapped
          to 7,094 probe sets from the HG-U95A chip giving a total
          of 8,044 comparisons between the two generations.
          Affymetrix also provides a list of the numbers of probe
          pairs common for the two generations.
          The correlation coefficient was used as a measure of
          congruency between the probe sets across the two
          generations of Affymetrix Chips (see Table 3 [ Additional
          File 1]). The correlation for different subsets of probe
          sets was computed based on certain probe set
          characteristics, as discussed above. Finally, a
          chi-square analysis was done to determine whether the
          absolute calls made for the HuGeneFL chip were different
          from the absolute calls made for the HG-U95A chip.
