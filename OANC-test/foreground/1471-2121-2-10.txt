        Cellular events are based on specific inter- and
        intra-molecular interactions of many molecules. To
        experimentally dissect such interactions, it is important
        to maintain as closely as possible the cytosolic
        environment of the living cell. Detergents are frequently
        employed to disrupt cells for the demonstration and
        isolation of functionally relevant protein complexes and/or
        to selectively extract certain proteins. For example, the
        non-ionic detergents Triton X-100, Tween 20 or Brij, have
        been widely used for histochemical purposes or in
        biochemical experiments to separate detergent-soluble from
        a detergent-resistant residue [ 1, 2, 3]. The latter is
        commonly referred to as the "cytoskeleton" or "membrane
        skeleton" [ 4]. During cell activation discrete signaling
        molecules are known to associate with or to disassociate
        from the plasma membrane and both, the cytoskeleton and
        membrane skeleton undergoes significant changes as well [
        4, 5, 6, 7]. For cytochemical purposes, however, detergents
        cannot be used before cells have been fixed, as non-ionic
        detergent treatment causes removal of the cells from their
        supporting surface (e.g. cover glass). The choice of
        fixative for a particular cytochemical study is often a
        difficult task owing to the limited available information
        about the effects of fixatives on cultured cells.
        Considering their effect on proteins, fixatives in
        general can be divided into two types: "coagulant" or
        "non-coagulant". Both groups of fixatives have advantages
        and disadvantages. The coagulant fixatives, including
        methanol [ 8, 9], ethanol [ 10], acetone [ 11], and
        trichloroacetic acid [ 10, 12], denature and precipitate
        proteins. These fixatives stop biological reactions
        instantaneously and presumably leave proteins in their
        original locations. Due to extraction of membrane
        structures by such fixatives it is not necessary to add
        detergents during staining with membrane impermeable probes
        such as antibodies. However, the denaturation of proteins
        seen with these fixatives has disadvantages for some probes
        [ 8, 12] and for visualizing intact cell surfaces.
        Moreover, it is not known if and to what extent proteins
        are lost during specimen preparation for microscopic
        observation (e.g. during incubation or washing procedures).
        The non-coagulant fixatives are mainly chemical
        crosslinkers that include glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde,
        acrolein, and dithiobis (succinimidylpropionate). They are
        used to preserve surface morphology of cells and to
        immobilize cellular components before extraction with
        detergents [ 8, 13, 14]. However, excess crosslinking
        frequently masks binding domains for probes while
        inadequate fixation may not preserve structures to leave
        them susceptible to mechanical forces during specimen
        processing. The latter is quite critical especially to
        preserve fine and fragile cellular microextensions such as
        filopodia or retraction fibers [ 15, 16].
        We have been interested in the formation and function of
        microextensions because of their dynamic and universal
        nature, and since moesin, an actin-binding protein is
        enriched in these structures [ 17, 18]. The F-actin-binding
        activity of moesin is regulated by both phosphorylation and
        polyphosphoinositides (PIPs) 1. Interestingly, PIPs could
        be substituted for by a cationic detergent,
        dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DOTMAC) 
        in vitro [ 19]. This result was
        consistent with biochemical extraction studies, since
        phosphorylated moesin specifically co-sedimented with
        DOTMAC-, but not Triton X-100-resistant components, most
        likely because Triton X-100 interfered with the interaction
        between moesin and PIPs [ 19]. This result also suggested
        that Triton X-100 extraction of cells may not preserve
        moesin-actin filament complexes.
        As expected, we show here that some of microextensions
        were fragmented by the standard Triton X-100
        permeabilization method. By contrast, DOTMAC completely
        extracted membrane lipids while maintaining the
        cytoskeleton of microextensions.
        We also observed microextensions having a considerably
        smaller diameter from those commonly seen (<0.05 μm vs.
        0. 2 μm). Referred to here as ultramicroextensions, these
        extended from cell bodies and grew out from the tips of
        other microextensions. DOTMAC treatment exposed and
        stabilized their cytoskeleton as well.
      
      
        Results
        
          Examination of microextensions of NIH3T3 fibroblast
          by scanning electron microscopy
          We used NIH3T3 cells because their morphology and
          localization of cytoskeletal proteins including actin,
          tubulin, vinculin, and moesin have been extensively
          investigated using various fixatives. When removed from
          stock cultures with trypsin and inoculated into
          coverslip-containing dishes, NIH3T3 cells readily
          attached to the serum-coated substrate, began to spread
          and flattened within one hour (data not shown).
          Consistent with the report by Rajaraman et al.[ 20] on
          human diploid WI-38 cells and Albrecht-Buehler and
          Goldman [ 21] on 3T3 fibroblasts, microextensions
          appeared within 20 min after seeding. Initially during
          spreading, the cells lost microvilli from their upper
          cell surface and formed microextensions with a diameter
          of about 0.2 μm and a maximal length of about 10 μm.
          Subsequently, the cells continued to spread and to
          randomly elongate microextensions up to 40 μm. However,
          closer examination of the fixed cells with a 60° tilt
          angle showed numerous additional protrusions extending
          from the cell body with a diameter of only about 0.05 μm
          (Figure 1). These structures were not observed in cells
          prior to 12 hours after inoculation. At 48 hour, about 5%
          (7/130) of the cells had extended such structures that
          usually were < 0.5 μm in length, and rarely exceeded 1
          μm. Because of these unique features, we will use the
          term ultramicroextensions. Three days after reaching
          confluency (at about one week in culture), about half of
          the surface of the cells was covered with
          ultramicroextensions (Figure 1, D,E,F). When cells were
          inoculated at high density, ultramicroextensions appeared
          earlier, but ultramicroextensions were rarely seen even
          after incubation for prolonged periods in sparse cultures
          or when the cells did not make contact (data not shown).
          Ultramicroextensions originated either from
          microextensions of neighboring cells or from tips of
          other microextensions in a broom-like fashion (Figure
          1G). Ultramicroextensions also originated from the cell
          surface similar to microvilli (Figure 1H), or as branches
          from other microextensions and ultramicroextensions
          (Figure 1I). Identical results were obtained when the
          cells were grown on poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips (data
          not shown).
        
        
          Exposure of cytoskeleton in microextensions and
          ultramicroextensions by DOTMAC extraction
          Fixation with formaldehyde followed by extraction with
          Triton X-100 is a fairly standard method for
          immunofluorescence microscopy of cells, but
          microextensions were fragmented and sometimes even lost
          during this treatment as shown in Figure 2, A,B,C. an
          alternative method, we extracted cells also with DOTMAC
          and discovered that fixation and extraction with 1.0 %
          PFA/0.5 % DOTMAC in PBS(+) on ice for 5 min, followed by
          fixation with 1.0% PFA in PBS on ice for 20 min
          (DOTMAC/PFA method), preserved not only micropodia (white
          arrow, Figure 2, Eand 2F), but also microvilli (black
          arrow, Figure 2Eand 2F), and ultramicroextensions (white
          arrowhead, Figure 2F). This treatment extracted lipids
          (data not shown) and exposed cytoplasmic filaments giving
          origin to ultramicroextensions (Figure 2F). At the cell
          edge the ultramicroextensions are derived from a deeper
          cytoskeletal meshwork (white arrowhead, Figure 2F) rather
          than from thick cytoskeletal filaments.
          We have performed ultrastructural analysis by SEM of
          cells fixed and/or extracted by the methods listed in
          Table 1. When the cells were treated with coagulant
          fixatives, the cytoskeleton was apparently exposed, but
          the three dimensional structures at the edge of the cells
          were not preserved as well as those prepared by the
          DOTMAC/PFA method (data not shown). When the cells were
          extracted with Triton X-100, NP-40 or saponin after
          relatively weak fixation with formaldehyde, the
          cytoskeleton apparently was lost, fragmented, or scraped
          off depending on the concentration of detergents and the
          period of incubation (Table 2). Too high a concentration
          of glutaraldehyde or incubation for extended period of
          time in formaldehyde, on the other hand, did not allow to
          expose the cytoskeleton (data not shown).
        
        
          Comparison of different fixation/extraction methods
          for preservation and fluorescence labeling of
          microextensions
          We also compared the different fixation and extraction
          procedures listed in Table 1 with respect to fluorescence
          intensity and labeling of actin stress fibers and
          microtubules, and with respect to morphological
          preservation of cells and microextensions (Table 2). The
          latter was also assessed from SEM micrographs before and
          after preparation for fluorescence microscopy and these
          results are summarized in Table 2 as well.
          Staining of actin and tubulin filaments differed
          depending on the probe and on the fixative. Among the
          coagulant fixatives, acetone produced the best results
          with respect to preservation of microextensions, staining
          of actin with either phalloidin or with monoclonal
          β-actin antibodies, and staining of microtubules with a
          monoclonal anti-β-tubulin reagent. After methanol or
          ethanol fixation, some cells were partially detached and
          changed their shape, but this did not occur with other
          coagulant fixatives. Acetone also provided good
          preservation of microextensions even after preparing the
          cells for immunolabeling, whereas some of the
          microextensions were lost, when cells were fixed with
          other coagulant fixatives (Table 2).
          Fixation with chemical crosslinkers, followed by
          extraction with detergents or organic solvents, are
          standard procedures for preparing cells for
          immunofluorescence. First, we investigated effects on the
          preservation of microextensions by variations in
          detergent concentration and time of incubation with
          formaldehyde. As summarized in Table 2, with shorter time
          periods of fixation and with higher detergent
          concentrations more cells lost microextensions. For
          example, when cells were fixed with 3.7% FA for 20 min
          and extracted with 0.2% TX100 for 5 min (Table 1), stress
          fibers were stained well with phalloidin, but
          microextensions were lost (Figure 3Aand 3B). The SEM
          observation before and after preparation for fluorescence
          microscopy (washing and incubation with probes) indicated
          that microextensions were lost during these steps of the
          procedure. On the other hand, microextensions of cells
          prefixed with glutaraldehyde or DSP prior to extraction
          were very well preserved indeed (Figure 3Eand 3I).
          However, the cytoskeleton of glutaraldehyde-fixed cells
          could not be exposed by the detergent and some structures
          apparently were lost in DSP-Tsb-fixed cells when analysed
          by SEM (data not shown). Quick extraction with 0.2%
          Triton X-100 in MTSB (30 seconds, 2 times), followed by
          fixation with 1% glutaraldehyde also preserved
          microextensions well indicating that fragmentation or
          removal of microextensions by extraction with 0.2% Triton
          X-100 does not occur within 1 min. The DOTMAC/PFA method
          provided excellent morphological preservation and
          immunolabeling with high fluorescence intensity of actin
          stress fibers and microextensions (Figure 3Qand 3S).
          Although phalloidin staining and immunolabeling of
          tubulin were poor in cells prepared by the DOTMAC/PFA
          method (Figure 3Rand 3T), this method provided the widest
          spectrum of reactivity with the probes investigated here
          (Figure 3and Table 1). The monoclonal antibody reagent
          specific for β-actin worked only in TCA or
          DOTMAC/PFA-treated cells (Figure 3Oand 3S).
          Next, we compared the staining patterns of two
          well-characterized cytoskeletal proteins, vinculin and
          moesin, in cells prepared by DOTMAC/PFA and other
          conventional fixation methods (Figure 4). As expected.
          vinculin localized at focal contacts in cells prepared by
          either PFA/Triton X-100 or by DOTMAC/PFA (Figure 4, B, J,
          and 4M). Moesin staining, on the other hand, was
          primarily at the edge of cells and in microextensions,
          when cells were fixed with TCA or DOTMAC/PFA (Figure
          4Gand 4K). DOTMAC/PFA was superior to TCA and the
          standard Triton X-100 permeabilization procedure to
          preserve microextensions and for moesin staining (Figure
          4, G, K, and 4N,O,P).
          TCA fixation was reported recently to be useful for
          staining of phosphorylated moesin [ 12]. Therefore, we
          tested our anti-phospho-moesin antibodies with this
          method and, as shown in Figure 4H, the fluorescence
          intensity was too low to distinguish characteristic
          structures probably because the amount of phosphorylated
          moesin is low in unstimulated NIH3T3 cells (cf. Figure
          7). Figure 5demonstrates another example of NIH3T3 cells
          stained with actin monoclonal and moesin polyclonal
          antibodies after DOTMAC/PFA fixation. Many branched
          microextensions were double-stained with these
          antibodies, but occasionally, part of a microextension or
          an entire microextension apparently lacked actin [ 17,
          22].
        
        
          Evaluation of crosslinked polypeptides after
          fixation and extraction
          Our results suggested that some of procedures listed
          in Table 1 were inadequate for preserving fine structural
          details. Therefore, we re-evaluated the extent of
          crosslinking of polypeptides by gel electrophoresis and
          western blotting. The polypeptide banding patterns of
          extracts from unfixed and fixed cells with SDS sample
          buffer are shown in Figure 6. Incubation in 0.5% Triton
          X-100 in PBS detached cells from the dish (Figure 6A,
          lane 2), but addition of 1 mM magnesium and 1 mM calcium
          ions in PBS prevented detachment to some extent (Figure
          6A, lane 3). Microtubule stabilizing buffer also
          prevented detachment (Figure 6A, lane 5). On the other
          hand, most polypeptides were retained on the dish after
          DOTMAC treatment (Figure 6A, lane 6). Although most of
          β-actin was retained after 0.5% detergent extraction,
          moesin was not unless 1% paraformaldehyde was added
          (Figure 6A, lanes 4 and 7). Under these conditions,
          moesin and β-actin migrated predominantly as monomeric
          polypeptides at 45 and 78 kDa positions on the SDS-PAGE
          gels and only very small amounts of crosslinked moesin
          and β-actin were detected by western blotting at higher
          molecular weight positions (data not shown).
          Crosslinking of polypeptides was also evaluated after
          treatment with several other fixatives that preserved
          microextensions well and that were found to be useful
          previously for moesin staining (Figure 6B). Only a small
          amount of polypeptides was extracted when cells were
          fixed with glutaraldehyde or DSP-Tsb (Figure 6B, lane 2,
          3 and 6) and the cells were morphologically well
          preserved by these fixatives as observed by SEM,
          indicating that most proteins were irreversibly
          crosslinked. On the other hand, when cells were fixed
          with PLP or LP and treated with 1% saponin in 3% BSA for
          permeabilization, most of the polypeptides were either
          not crosslinked by these relatively mild fixatives or
          crosslinks were reversed by the addition of SDS sample
          buffer (Figure 6B, lanes 4 and 5). Similar results were
          obtained when cells were fixed with 3.7% formalin or 4%
          PFA, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100.
          Threonine558-phosphomoesin was not dephosphorylated in
          these fixatives, as determined by western blotting with
          specific phosphomoesin antibodies (Figure 6B). We
          examined the effect of incubation time and temperature
          during fixation with 4% PFA in PBS(+), since conditions
          for irreversible crosslinking of polypeptides in cultured
          cells with formaldehyde are unknown. As shown in Figure
          6C, fixation under the widely used conditions at room
          temperature (25°C) for 20 min, is not sufficient to
          irreversibly crosslink actin, moesin and many other
          polypeptides. At 37°C, the required time for incubation
          can be shortened, but most of the actin molecules were
          not irreversibly crosslinked even after 30 min.
          Incubation with sodium borohydride after fixation in PFA
          had no effect either (data not shown) suggesting that
          reversible bridges may have formed that could not be
          reduced.
        
        
          Biochemical analysis of DOTMAC-insoluble materials
          of NIH3T3 cells
          NIH3T3 cells suspended in PBS were treated with 1 μM
          staurosporine, 1 μM calyculin A or 100 μM pervanadate and
          fractionated with 0.5% Triton X-100 or DOTMAC. Similar to
          results in platelets [ 19], the polypeptide patterns on
          SDS-PAGE gels differed for DOTMAC- and Triton
          X-100-extracted cells and more polypeptides were
          recovered in the DOTMAC- as compared to the Triton
          X-100-insoluble fraction (Figure 7). Many signaling
          molecules are known to be sequestered into the Triton
          X-100-insoluble fraction during activation and/or
          aggregation of human platelets, and cytoskeletal
          association has been inferred from this result. While
          this may be true for some proteins, the postulated
          cytoskeletal association of threonine558-phosphorylated
          moesin was maintained only when platelets were extracted
          with DOTMAC, but not with Triton X-100 [ 19]. By
          contrast, phosphorylated moesin was found in the
          insoluble material of NIH3T3 cells after extraction with
          both types of detergent (Figure 7). When extracted with
          0.5% detergent, a larger amount of insoluble
          phosphomoesin was detected with Triton X-100 as compared
          to DOTMAC. Different concentrations of detergents (0.1%,
          1% and 2%) were tested and correlated with the amount of
          moesin released from NIH3T3 cells, but the insoluble
          fraction of moesin was always higher with Triton X-100
          than with DOTMAC (data not shown).
          We also analysed for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins
          in the insoluble fraction of cells treated with
          pervanadate (PV), a potent inhibitor of tyrosine
          phosphatases, extracted with 0.5% detergent. A larger
          fraction of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were
          recovered in the DOTMAC-insoluble pellet (unpublished
          observation)
        
        
          DOTMAC induces bundling of actin filaments and
          microtubules
          The excellent preservation of the cytoskeleton in
          microextensions of cells fixed with PFA/DOTMAC could be
          due to stabilization of the cytoskeleton in general or of
          actin filaments selectively. We, therefore, explored
          whether DOTMAC has a direct effect in vitro on actin
          filaments prepared from purified actin. As shown in
          Figure 8, actin filaments bundled in the presence of
          DOTMAC (Figure 8B) suggesting that this might contribute
          to the greater stability of the actin cytoskeleton that
          we have observed in cells extracted with this detergent.
          This effect is relatively specific since DOTMAC disrupted
          microtubules and they appeared as amorphous filaments
          (Figure 8D).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Detection and definition of micropodia and
          ultramicroextensions
          Extensions of the cell surface were first described as
          fibrous projections of tissue culture cells by electron
          microscopy in 1945 [ 23]. Since then, the terminology has
          varied in the literature and extensions have been
          designated as pseudopodia [ 24], microextensions [ 25],
          retraction fibers [ 25], microspikes [ 26], filopodia [
          24, 27, 28], often without a clear definition of these
          terms. Microvilli are light microscopically distinct from
          filopodia and retraction fibers [ 29]. Filopodia or
          microspikes extend actively from the cell surface,
          whereas retraction fibers are extensions that have been
          left behind by a retracting lamellipodium or that are
          derived from an attached filopodium. We use the term
          "micropodia" here for morphologically describing
          filopodia, microspikes, and retraction fibers, and to
          differentiate these structures from lamellipodia. While
          the transiently occurring filopodia and retraction fibers
          can largely be distinguished only by time-lapse video
          microscopy [ 22], both, micropodia and lamellipodia, are
          functionally related to movement of cells. Micropodia
          were reported to have diameters of about 0.2 μm [ 29] or
          0.08∼ 0.16 μm [ 20] and lengths ranging from 5 to 30 μm [
          29]. On the other hand, microvilli are more permanent
          discrete cylindrical projections about 0.1 μm in diameter
          and up to 2 μm in length [ 29] that may serve different
          purposes, such as in brushborder membranes of the
          intestinal epithelium or in lymphocytes. Numerous slender
          extensions running in parallel were observed previously,
          when rat epithelial (parenchymal) cells adhere to each
          other [ 30]. Similar structures also occur in primary
          keratinocytes mediating intercellular adhesion [ 31].
          However, these extensions appeared to be thicker
          (estimated as 0.1μm in diameter, although their apparent
          diameter depended on conditions of coating with
          metals).
          Our experiments were focused on the analysis of
          microextensions and their cytoskeletal core by SEM and
          confocal laser scanning microscopy by searching for a new
          fixation protocol. Here, we clearly show that NIH3T3
          cells not only extend microextensions of 0.1∼ 0.2 μm in
          diameter and of up to ∼ 40 μm in length, but also slender
          structures of less than 0.05 μm diameter. The latter were
          previously described in the tumor cell lines K-A31
          (Balb/3T3 clone A31 transformed by murine sarcoma virus,
          [ 32]), and in A875, a malignant human lung melanoma line
          [ 33]. In K-A31 cells, membranous strands with diameters
          of less than 0.1 μm extended away from and between cells
          over distances of 10-15 μm. In A875 cells, "filopodia"
          had diameters of 0.05 μm or less and were often branched.
          However, details of these structures were not given and
          not further discussed. In the literature, terms such as
          slender filopodia [ 34, 35], or slender microvilli [ 36,
          37] have been used. All filopodia and microvilli are
          morphologically slender and these descriptive terms in
          general have not been used to refer to microextensions
          having a particular dimension. In order to distinguish
          them from others and to avoid confusion, we propose the
          term ultramicroextensions for discrete cellular
          extensions that are less than 0.05 μm in diameter.
          Ultramicroextensions extend like micropodia from the cell
          surface, from the tips of micropodia, from microvilli, or
          they branch out from micropodia or other
          ultramicroextensions. We strongly believe that these are
          unique structures and not artificially created by our
          sample preparation technique. First, unless cells
          contacted each other, they were rarely seen even after
          incubation for prolonged periods, suggesting that they
          are not simply created by the collapse of parts of the
          cell. Secondly, their shape is rather similar to the
          generally larger microspikes or microvilli. Future work
          might show that they can be detected by differential
          interference-contrast microscopy and electronic image
          processing or other techniques, which would greatly
          facilitate functional studies. Ultramicroextensions may
          be difficult to distinguish by immunofluorescence
          microscopy from micropodia that also appear as small
          fluorescent dots on the cell body, or they may remain
          undetected due to low fluorescence signal owing to their
          small size. The filopodia of spreading 3T3 cells were
          extensively studied by Albrecht-Buehler et al [ 21, 27,
          29], but ultramicroextensions were not described
          presumably because these studies were carried out during
          early spreading of 3T3 cells. Cells that do not touch
          other cells rarely display ultramicroextensions even
          after long periods of incubation. Ultramicroextensions
          were quite frequent between cells and on the surface of
          cells grown at confluency. This suggests that their
          formation is triggered by contact with other cells and
          that they are not primarily related to cell movement.
        
        
          Preservation and exposure of cytoskeleton in
          microextensions and ultramicroextensions
          We have successfully exposed the cytoskeleton of
          microextensions and ultramicroextensions using a newly
          developed fixative that contains DOTMAC. In order to
          study the structure of the cytoskeletal network it is
          necessary to extract cells with a detergent to expose
          cytoskeletal filaments for electron microscopic imaging.
          Several detergents were tested for their effects on
          cytoskeletal structures by Schliwa et al. [ 3], but the
          cationic detergent DOTMAC was not included. In addition,
          past studies on the cytoskeleton of detergent-extracted
          cells have mainly focused on the cell body and subcortex
          [ 3, 8], but not on microextensions. Although extraction
          can be done before, during, or after fixation, we used
          simultaneous extraction and fixation, because (i)
          cytoskeletal molecules may be rearranged or altered
          during fixation, as irreversible crosslinking of
          polypeptides is not complete even after 15 min incubation
          with 4% PFA at 37°C; (ii) although actin was more
          difficult to extract, moesin and other polypeptides were
          removed already with 0.5% DOTMAC in the absence of PFA.
          Addition of 1% PFA was a necessary compromise to
          visualize the cytoskeleton and its associated molecules
          no matter which detergent was being used.
          Although DOTMAC induced bundling of actin filaments
          and microtubules, which could have affected
          ultrastructural features of the cytoskeleton,
          microextensions of DOTMAC/PFA-extracted cells did not
          differ from those of non-treated cells. On the contrary,
          bundling of actin filaments by DOTMAC may have stabilized
          these actin-containing structures. In SEM, micropodia,
          ultramicroextensions and microvilli were well preserved,
          but their lipid membranes apparently were lost. This made
          it possible to trace the origin of micropodia and
          ultramicroextensions. While the cytoskeleton of
          micropodia appeared to connect to the cytoskeleton
          located at the edge of the cells, by contrast, filaments
          of ultramicroextensions seemed to extend from or connect
          to cytoplasmic, rather than subcortical structures.
          Triton X-100 is the most widely used detergent to
          expose the cytoskeleton for biochemical and
          immunohistological studies, but without prefixation it
          caused a marked loss of cytoskeletal material [ 38, 39].
          This method also has been criticized for loss of the
          microtrabecular lattice [ 3, 40]. This loss is sometimes
          advantageous to expose certain types of filaments [ 40],
          but this was not relevant to our study. Triton X-100 is
          not useful and even inappropriate for exposing and
          maintaining the cytoskeleton of microextensions. The
          fragmentation of microextensions and the amount of
          material lost with this detergent were time, temperature
          and concentration dependent. The cytoskeleton tended to
          be unmasked at low temperatures and at low concentrations
          of Triton X-100, and the loss of material occurred
          especially in lamellipodia [ 40]. These earlier data are
          consistent with our results concerning lamellipodia, but
          other microextensions were ignored. Previous authors
          preferred to use 1% Triton X-100, a relatively high
          concentration of detergent, because it is critical for
          rapid solubilization of the cell membrane and cessation
          of cell activity. However, 1% Triton X-100 destroyed
          microextensions even in PEM buffer. Another problems with
          Triton X-100 is that most of the cells detached from the
          substrate and the remaining cells are usually quite
          distorted in shape [ 38]. We have seen similar shape
          changes with Triton X-100-extracted cells after
          relatively short prefixation with formaldehyde (Table
          2).
          The composition of the extraction buffer is an
          important factor [ 15]. Although MTSB, which is
          essentially similar to PHEM, PEM, or MTPB, was shown to
          give the best preservation of the cytoskeleton, no
          morphological differences were seen between these buffers
          and PBS(+), when the cells were extracted with DOTMAC
          (data not shown). Addition of phalloidin, taxol, or PEG
          did not make a difference either (data not shown). In our
          experience, the divalent cations in PBS(+) prevented the
          cellular retraction seen within a few minutes with PBS
          and are necessary to maintain interactions between
          DOTMAC-resistant components and the substrate (data not
          shown). DOTMAC, on the other hand, caused rapid cessation
          of all cell activity.
          The type of fixative is another important determinant
          for the analysis of cell shape and structural integrity
          of the cytoskeleton. Glutaraldehyde is considered the
          best fixative to preserve these structures, but there are
          associated disadvantages. Prefixation and postfixation
          with glutaraldehyde precludes exposure of the
          cytoskeleton and, also quite frequently, the binding of
          antibody probes. On the other hand, formaldehyde is a
          rather weak crosslinker. A crosslink formed by
          formaldehyde between two functional groups is
          theoretically and experimentally a non-reducible
          methylene bridge. Such bridges are readily hydrolysed
          during washing. The only irreversible reaction would be
          one that takes place slowly with the aromatic hydrogen [
          41]. Our studies provide first systematic data that cells
          should be kept in 4% PFA for at least 60 min at room
          temperature or for 20 min at 37°C to irreversibly
          crosslink most of the polypeptides (Figure 6). Thus,
          enzymatic reactions or rearrangement of components in the
          cytosol could occur for some time during fixation. In
          fact, dephosphorylation of moesin occurred in mouse
          epithelial MTD-1 cells during fixation in 1% or 4%
          paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min [ 12]. As
          shown here, however, moesin apparently was not
          dephosphorylated in PFA-based fixatives in NIH3T3 cells.
          These conflicting results could be due to differences of
          cell type and/or antibody reactivity. We have prepared
          the formaldehyde solution by dissolving PFA in water,
          because it was pointed out that methanol included in
          commercial formaldehyde as a preservative, is enough to
          cause retraction of ruffles and lamellipodia [ 15].
          However, no morphological difference between PFA and
          formaldehyde was apparent when cells were extracted with
          DOTMAC (data not shown).
        
        
          Evaluation of DOTMAC/PFA method by fluorescent
          microscopy
          Amieva et al. [ 22] pointed out that some
          microextensions may be lost during fixation and washing
          steps, and Nobes and Hall [ 16] added glutaraldehyde to
          the fixative in order to stain these delicate structures
          with phalloidin, but glutaraldehyde had to be omitted for
          immunostaining. Because the procedure developed here
          resulted in a comparable preservation of microextensions,
          we systematically analysed these structures with various
          probes by immunofluorescence microscopy. The DOTMAC/PFA
          method provided excellent morphological preservation of
          actin stress fibers and microextensions and high
          intensity immunolabeling of actin, while phalloidin
          staining was poor probably owing to partial denaturation
          of actin filaments. The DOTMAC/PFA method thus should be
          considered the method of choice for the preservation and
          immunostaining of microextensions or when cells fixed by
          other methods cannot be stained with certain
          antisera.
        
        
          Functional significance of fractionation of
          polypeptides into DOTMAC-resistant components in NIH3T3
          cells
          We have previously shown that purified
          threonine558-phosphomoesin selectively co-sedimented with
          actin filaments in the presence of DOTMAC or PIPs, but
          excess Triton X-100 disrupted the interaction of moesin
          with PIPs [ 19]. Furthermore, the cytoskeletal
          association of threonine558-phosphomoesin was maintained
          when platelets were extracted with DOTMAC, but not with
          Triton X-100. These results were consistent with a model
          of an allosteric change induced by PIPs (or DOTMAC) that
          exposed and maintained a cytoskeleton-binding site of
          moesin. In NIH3T3 cells, however, unlike in platelets,
          most of threonine558-phosphomoesin was retained in the
          Triton X-100-insoluble, but only ∼ 20% in the
          DOTMAC-insoluble fraction. How can this difference be
          reconciled? One possibility is that moesin in NIH3T3
          cells is modified differently. For example, moesin is
          tyrosine phosphorylated in v-src-transfected MDCK cells [
          42]. A second possibility is that
          threonine558-phosphomoesin interacts with non-extractable
          membrane constituents besides actin filaments in cells
          other than platelets. For example, the N-terminal domain
          of moesin lacking the C-terminal F-actin binding domain
          remained strongly associated with the NP-40-insoluble
          material of NIH3T3 cells [ 22]. While this issue needs
          further work, it is clear that detergent extraction alone
          cannot be used as the sole criterion for cytoskeletal
          association of proteins such as moesin as stated
          frequently in the recent literature.
        
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Chemicals and antibodies
          DME medium was obtained from Nissui (Tokyo, Japan) or
          Sigma (St. Louis, MO). FCS was purchased from GIBCO BRL
          Life Technologies (Paisley, Scotland) or Sigma. Other
          tissue culture reagents were purchased from GIBCO. All
          lipids were from Sigma. Glutaraldehyde (70% stock in
          water, EM grade), paraformaldehyde (PFA), and organic
          solvents were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto,
          Japan). Anti-β-actin mouse mAb (A5441), anti-β-tubulin
          mouse mAb (T4026), anti-vinculin mouse mAb (V9131),
          anti-mouse IgG FITC conjugate (F2012), anti-rabbit IgG
          FITC conjugate (F1262), anti-rabbit IgG TRITC conjugate
          (T5268), and TRITC labeled phalloidin were purchased from
          Sigma. Anti-mouse IgG rhodamine conjugate (AP124R) was
          obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA).
          Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (95/1) were used
          for the identification of moesin by immunoblotting and
          for immunofluorescence. The affinity-purified polyclonal
          antibodies against threonine558-phospho-moesin were
          prepared as described previously [ 43]. Actin was
          prepared as described previously [ 19]. Tubulin was
          purchased from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO).
        
        
          Cell culture
          NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in DME medium
          containing 1000 mg/liter glucose, supplemented with 10%
          FCS, 4 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and
          streptomycin (100 μg/ml), at 37°C in a humidified
          atmosphere of 5% CO 
          2 in air. Cells were washed with PBS
          containing 1 mM CaCl 
          2 and 1 mM MgCl 
          2 (PBS(+)), detached by treating with
          0.05% trypsin in PBS or 0.02% EDTA in PBS. The suspended
          cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in growth medium,
          and plated on FCS-coated glass coverslips for microscopy,
          or onto 35-mm or 100-mm Falcon plastic culture dishes
          (Beckton Dickinson, Lincoln, NJ) or FCS-coated glass
          culture dishes for biochemical experiments. In some
          cases, detached cells were resuspended in growth medium
          without washing.
        
        
          Scanning electron microscopy
          For the observation of cellular surface, cells were
          rinsed with PBS(+) and fixed with PBS(+) containing 2%
          glutaraldehyde (dilute 70% glutaraldehyde just before
          use) at 4°C for 1 hour. In most references, cells were
          rinsed with PBS (although PBS, in some references, means
          PBS that contains CaCl 
          2 and MgCl 
          2 ), but we preferred PBS(+) because
          retraction of cells were observed in a few minutes when
          the cells were exposed to PBS even briefly. Samples were
          then washed with distilled water, dehydrated in a graded
          series of ethanol, transferred into t-butylalchohol, and
          dried in Freeze Dryer ES-2030 (Hitachi, Japan). Dried
          samples were coated with Pt-Pd in Ion Sputter E-1030
          (Hitachi, Japan) for 120 seconds, and were examined under
          an S-4200 scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan)
          at 15 kV. Micrographs were taken at 0° or 60° tilt.
        
        
          Fixation and extraction for microscopy
          Cells on glass coverslips were rinsed with PBS(+),
          fixed and/or extracted by one of the procedures listed in
          Table 1. Methanol-free formaldehyde solution can be
          obtained from commercial sources, but it has to be used
          within a week and is more expensive than PFA powder [
          61]. Although formaldehyde and PFA were used in papers as
          listed in Table 1 and formaldehyde solutions may have
          been obtained from commercial sources, for our study a
          formaldehyde aqueous stock solution was prepared by
          dissolving 20 g of PFA powder in 90 ml of double
          distilled water. The mixture was heated to 60-65°C and
          the pH was adjusted to 7.3 with NaOH. The solution was
          diluted with water to 100 ml (final concentration 20%)
          and stored at 4°C for not more than one week. In earlier
          work, formaldehyde solutions may have been prepared from
          formalin that contains 37% formaldehyde and 8∼ 15%
          methanol. Unless noted as formalin, formaldehyde
          solutions were solely prepared here as described above.
          Therefore, formaldehyde and PFA are essentially
          indistinguishable. Buffers were prepared as 2× or 5×
          stock solutions. Magnesium-and calcium-free PBS was used
          unless noted otherwise in the references. When detailed
          descriptions were lacking, specimens were treated as
          listed in Table 1.
        
        
          Confocal laser scanning microscopy
          Blocking of nonspecific binding sites and incubation
          with antibodies basically followed procedures detailed in
          references, but cells were stained as follows when
          descriptions were lacking. After the cells were soaked in
          1% BSA/PBS for 30 min, they were treated with the primary
          antibodies in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h. The cells were then
          washed with PBS three times, followed by incubation with
          secondary antibodies in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h. For the
          detection of actin filaments, 100 ng/ml TRITC-phalloidin
          was mixed with the second antibody solution. For double
          staining, secondary antibodies that did not cross-react
          with each other were chosen. Cells were washed three
          times in PBS for 5 min and rinsed with water at room
          temperature, mounted in PermaFluor (Shandon, Pittsburgh,
          PA) and observed under a laser scanning confocal
          microscope (MRC-1024, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond,
          CA). Confocal sections were taken with an iris aperture
          of 2.0. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop
          software.
        
        
          Evaluation of crosslinking by polypeptide analysis
          after fixation and extraction
          Subconfluent cultures of NIH3T3 cells on 3.5 cm
          plastic culture dishes, were rinsed with PBS(+), fixed
          with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS(+) at room temperature or
          37°C, or fixed and/or extracted by one of the procedures
          listed in Table 1. For some experiments, cells after
          fixation were treated twice with 0.5 mg/ml NaBH 
          4 in PBS for 10 min at room
          temperature. After rinsing with PBS, the any material
          remaining on the dish was extracted with 200 μl of 1× SDS
          sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol,
          10% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) at room temperature for 30
          min in preparation for SDS-PAGE. The dissolved material
          was recovered and heated at 95°C for 10 min and resolved
          by SDS-PAGE on a 9% polyacrylamide gel. Polypeptides were
          stained with Coomassie Brilliant blue or immunologically
          stained with antibodies after transfer to nitrocellulose
          or polyvinylidenedifluoride membranes.
        
        
          Extraction for western blotting
          NIH 3T3 cells were detached from the dishes in the
          presence of 1 μM calyculin A, but not staurosporine and
          pervanadate. In order to exclude the effect of attachment
          on the extractability of proteins, suspended cells were
          used as a control sample. The cells were cultured on 10
          cm plastic culture dishes as described above. The
          subconfluent cells were washed three times with PBS(+),
          once with PBS, detached by treating with 0.02% EDTA in
          PBS. The suspended cells were collected, centrifuged at
          1,000 × 
          g for 5 min, and resuspended with
          PBS. The suspensions were divided and incubated with or
          without 1 μM calyculin A, 1 μM staurosporine, or 100 μM
          pervanadate in 200 μl of PBS(+) for 10 min at 37°C. The
          cells were extracted for 5 min on ice with 200 μl of 2×
          detergent extraction buffer (2% of Triton X-100 or
          DOTMAC, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EGTA, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM
          MgCl 
          2 , protease inhibitor cocktail [20
          μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μM E-64, 200 μM leupeptin, 200 μM
          p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride], 2 μM calyculin
          A, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 μM staurosporine, 20 μM
          phalloidin, and 20 μg/ml taxol). The lysates were
          centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The resulting
          pellets were solubilized in 150 μl of 1× SDS sample
          buffer. Total lysate was prepared by adding 150 μl of 1×
          SDS sample buffer to the pelleted cells after drug
          treatment described above. All samples were heated at
          95°C, sonicated and resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 9%
          polyacrylamide gel electrophoresed under reducing
          conditions as described [ 18]. β-Actin, moesin, and
          phosphorylated moesin were detected by immunoblotting and
          the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system.
        
        
          Lipid analysis of detergent-resistant
          components
          When NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were treated with Triton
          X-100 lysis buffer, most of the cells detached from the
          culture dish. This made it impossible to quantitatively
          analyze lipids in the detergent-insoluble fraction of
          attached growing cells. Therefore, the cells were
          suspended using EDTA before lipid analysis and extracted
          with detergent extraction buffer as described above. The
          lysates were centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 5 min at 4°C.
          The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed
          with PBS. The lipids were extracted with 0.5 ml of
          chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) in an ultrasonic bath for
          30 min at 37°C from the pellet. After centrifugation at
          15,800 × 
          g for 5 min, the supernatant was
          concentrated under nitrogen and spotted on a 10 × 10 cm
          Silica gel thin layer glass plate (LHP-K, Whatman).
          Phospholipids were separated by chromatography in
          100:75:7:4 of chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water.
          Plates were stained with 40% sulfuric acid in water.
          L-α-phosphatidylethanolamine, L-α-phosphatidylcholine,
          L-α-phosphatidyl-L-serine, L-α-phosphatidylinositol,
          L-α-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, sphingomyelin
          were identified by using a standard solution.
          When the cells were treated with DOTMAC lysis buffer,
          they did not detach and, therefore, lipids could be
          extracted directly from the cells on glass culture dishes
          with 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) after
          treatment with the detergent extraction buffer. The
          solvents and residues were collected in a tube and
          sonicated in an ultrasonic bath as described above. After
          centrifugation at 15,800 × 
          g for 5 min, lipids were analysed
          from the supernatant as described above.
        
        
          Transmission electron microscopy
          The phalloidin-stabilized α-actin filaments (1 μM)
          were incubated in buffer F (5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM
          Na 
          2 ATP, 2 mM MgCl 
          2 , 140 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM DTT, 0.2 mM
          CaCl 
          2 , 0.005% sodium azide) with or
          without 0.1 % DOTMAC for 10 min at 25°C. The
          taxol-stabilized β-tubulin (1 μM) was also incubated in
          PEM buffer (100 mM PIPES, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl 
          2 , pH6.8) containing 1 mM GTP with or
          without 0.1 % DOTMAC for 10 min at 25°C. 10 μl of samples
          were adsorbed for 60 s to carbon-coated 400 mesh/inch
          copper grids that were rendered hydrophilic by glow
          discharge for 15 s in air at low pressure. The grids were
          washed with 100 mM KCl and stained for 60 s on six drops
          of 1% uranyl acetate. Microscopy was performed on a
          HITACHI H-8100 electron microscope at an accelerating
          voltage of 100 kV.
