        A near-universal feature of cell signaling 
        via seven transmembrane, G
        protein-coupled receptors is attenuation of a cellular
        response upon prolonged exposure to an extracellular
        stimulus [ 1 ] . This desensitization process is
        well-established for GnRH-stimulated LH secretion from
        pituitary gonadotropes [ 2 3 ] , and occurs after about 6 h
        of continued exposure to GnRH in rats [ 3 ] ; removal of
        GnRH permits recovery from the profound suppression of LH
        secretion, albeit rather slowly (2-4 days; 4). The
        molecular mechanisms involved in GnRH-induced
        desensitization are poorly understood, but they do not
        appear to be due to alterations in GnRH receptor expression
        [ 5 6 ] or to changes in LH concentrations in the pituitary
        gland [ 7 8 ] .
        Earlier, we presented evidence that a regulator of G
        protein signaling, RGS3, might participate in the
        regulation of GnRH receptor signaling [ 9 ] . The mechanism
        of RGS action is antagonism of the Gα protein either by
        accelerating its hydrolysis of GTP, thereby prematurely
        terminating signaling due to reassociation of the Gα and
        Gβγ complexes [ 10 ] , or by antagonizing interaction of
        the Gα protein with its effector such as phospholipase Cβ [
        11 12 ] . A large number of RGS genes have been identified
        in mammals based on the presence of a 120 amino acid core
        domain [ 13 14 15 16 ] . RGS proteins have been described
        that interact with the G 
        i α and G 
        qα members of the G protein family [ 17
        18 19 20 21 ] .
        Previously, we showed that RSG3 was expressed
        endogenously in rat pituitary cells and, when
        experimentally co-expressed together with GnRH receptors in
        a heterologous cell line (COS1), it suppressed
        GnRH-stimulated inositol trisphosphate production [ 9 ] .
        Here, those studies have been extended to include
        GnRH-stimulated LH secretion using adenovirus-mediated gene
        transfer of RGS3 complementary DNA into normal rat
        pituitary gonadotropes. RGS3 was found to profoundly
        inhibit GnRH-stimulated LH secretion and 3H-inositol
        phosphate accumulation. However, a calcium ionophore
        stimulated LH secretion in RGS3-expressing gonadotropes,
        confirming a specific site of action occurring at
        phospholipase Cβ or earlier in the signal transduction
        pathway.
      
      
        Results
        The initial experiments were performed to confirm our
        earlier finding that RGS3 suppressed GnRH-stimulated IP 
        3 production in COS-1 cells [ 9 ] and to
        test a truncated form of RGS3, RGS3T (RGS3 314-519) [ 24 ]
        for suppressive activity in the same assay (Fig. 1). cDNAs
        representing the GnRH receptor and RGS3 or RGS3T were
        co-transfected into COS-1 cells for GnRH-A treatment 72 h
        later; intracellular IP 
        3 concentrations were measured at 0, 10,
        20, and 30 sec after addition of 10 -7M GnRH-A (Fig. 1). As
        expected, RGS3 exerted a profound suppression of IP 
        3 production at each of the time points
        during the 30 sec after agonist treatment (p < 0.05)
        (Fig. 1). RGS3T is comprised primarily by the consensus RGS
        domain and was originally reported to decrease the growth
        rate of yeast and to inhibit IL-8 receptor mediated
        activation of MAP kinase by a factor of 3-10 fold as
        compared to RGS3 [ 24 ] and was subsequently reported to be
        a normally expressed variant of RGS3 [ 37 ] . Therefore, we
        compared it to RGS3 for attenuation of GnRH-stimulated IP 
        3 production in COS-1 cells (Fig. 1). As
        reported by others [ 24 37 ] , we found that RGS3T was more
        potent than RGS3 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1). Identification of
        a C-terminal 205 amino acid variant of RGS3 that has equal
        or greater potency than the full-length 519 amino acid RGS3
        will facilitate the identification of RGS3 functional
        protein domains that are important for its activity.
        The family of RGS proteins are established to interact
        with various Gα-protein subunits, thereby antagonizing
        their activities [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 24 ] . Indeed, we
        previously reported that RGS3 bound Gqα [ 9 ] , the G
        protein subunit that mediates GnRH receptor signaling [ 38
        ] . Here, we have extended those binding studies to include
        other Gα proteins (Fig. 2). An RGS3-GST fusion protein was
        incubated with an 35S-Met-Gα-protein, and the amount of
        labeled Gα-protein was determined using glutathione-coupled
        beads to "pull down" the RGS3-GST/ 35S-Gα-protein complex
        that was then separated and quantified by SDS/PAGE (Fig.
        2). More Gqα was bound by RGS3 than any other protein,
        although its binding was not significantly different from
        that of Gzα and Giα (p > 0.05). Significant (p <
        0.05) amounts of Gi2α, Gi1α, Goα, and Gsα also were bound
        but were not as high as Gqα, Gzα, and Gi3α. These results
        confirm our previous findings that RGS3 interacts with Gqα
        but also show that it has significant interaction with all
        other Gα-proteins studied.
        The findings of the current, and an earlier study [ 9 ]
        , demonstrate clearly that RGS3 suppresses GnRH receptor
        signaling in a heterologous cell system. Because of the
        evidence that the signal transduction pathway for GnRH in
        gonadotropes involves the GnRH receptor, Gqα, phospholipase
        Cβ, and cellular IP 
        3 release [ 39 40 ] , we determined the
        effect of RGS3 on GnRH-stimulated LH secretion using
        adenoviral-mediated gene transfer in rat pituitary cells
        (Fig. 3). In these experiments, we performed a
        dose-response test that included three experimental groups:
        uninfected, adeno-β galactosidase, and adeno-RGS3 infected.
        Adeno-βgal infection was used for determination of the
        fraction of cells infected at each dose of virus (Fig. 3,
        top panel) and as a control for the effects of adeno-RGS3
        on GnRH-stimulated LH secretion (Fig. 3, middle panel).
        Cell viability, measured as trypan blue exclusion, varied
        from 98.5-100.0% (Fig. 3, top panel). The fraction of cells
        infected by the adenovirus depended on viral dose (0-5.0
        M.O.I.; 1 M.O.I. = 1 viral particle/pituitary cell) and
        ranged from about 2% (no adenovirus) to 99.5% (5.0 M.O.I.).
        Adeno-βgal had no effect on LH secretion at any dose
        compared to the uninfected group (Fig. 3, middle panel). In
        contrast, an inverse dose-related effect was observed
        between adeno-RGS3 and GnRH-stimulated LH secretion (Fig.
        3, bottom panel). RGS3 0.2 M.O.I. was the lowest dose to
        inhibit LH secretion (p < 0.05), and 2.0 and 5.0 M.O.I.
        exerted near complete inhibition of LH secretion; i.e. LH
        concentrations in these two latter GnRH-treated groups did
        not differ from their cohort controls (p > 0.05).
        The profound inhibition of GnRH-stimulated LH secretion
        observed in Fig. 3required verification that RGS3
        expression was induced by adeno-RGS3 infection. To address
        this issue, we performed RGS3 immunoblots (Fig. 4) which
        showed an increase in RGS3 protein expression in adeno-RGS3
        (5.0 M.O.I.) infected pituitary cells as compared to low to
        negligible levels of protein in the uninfected and
        adeno-βgal infected groups.
        As evidenced earlier, the molecular locus of RGS protein
        action is thought to be the G protein α subunit,
        specifically Gqα in the case of GnRH receptor activation.
        The results shown in Fig. 5are consistent with this
        conclusion: adeno-RGS3 infection of rat pituitary cells
        profoundly suppressed GnRH-stimulated 3H-inositol phosphate
        accumulation. These results are compatible with a molecular
        site of action for RGS3 being at phospholipase C or earlier
        in the signal transduction pathway.
        Another experiment conducted to test the specificity and
        molecular locus of RGS3 action in inhibiting
        GnRH-stimulated LH secretion was treatment of adeno-RGS3
        infected cells with an agent that increases intracellular
        calcium (Fig. 6). Calcium is an established stimulator of
        LH secretion that is thought to act at sites downstream of
        phospholipase C [ 39 40 ] . Therefore, adeno-RGS3 infected
        pituitary cells were treated with a calcium ionophore
        (A23187). Adeno-RSG3 inhibited LH secretion in the
        GnRH-treated control group as expected (Fig. 6). However,
        the calcium ionphore stimulated LH secretion in
        RGS3-expressing gonadotropes (Fig. 6), an effect that would
        be expected if the RGS3 inhibition was exerted at the level
        of the Gqα protein.
        In two final control studies, we investigated the effect
        of adeno-RGS3 on LH concentrations in pituitary cells and
        on GnRH receptor binding (Fig. 7). In neither case did RGS3
        affect these parameters of gonadotrope function (p >
        0.05).
      
      
        Discussion
        The quantity of LH secreted by the anterior pituitary
        gland is the outcome of an interaction between the amount
        of hypothalamic GnRH secretion and the level of gonadotrope
        responsiveness to GnRH [ 7 ] . Quantitatively, gonadotrope
        responsiveness is more important than the level of GnRH
        secretion; for example, during the estrogen-stimulated
        preovulatory surge of LH secretion in the rat there is a
        5-fold increase in GnRH secretion but a 50-fold increase in
        LH secretion [ 7 ] . Moreover, a quantity of GnRH that will
        evoke a normal preovulatory LH surge during the period
        preceding ovulation will induce only a small increase in LH
        secretion at other stages of the estrous cycle [ 7 ] .
        Similarly, termination of the preovulatory LH surge appears
        to be due to desensitization of the gonadotrope to GnRH
        action; in the sheep, a decrease in LH secretion precedes
        the decrease in GnRH secretion [ 41 ] , whereas in the rat,
        although the decrease in GnRH and LH secretion are
        co-incident [ 7 ] , there is evidence that the gonadotrope
        is already desensitized to GnRH [ 42 43 ] .
        The mechanisms that alter gonadotrope responsiveness to
        GnRH are unknown but they do not appear to be due to GnRH
        receptor number or LH stores in the pituitary gland [ 5 6 7
        8 ] . However, the fraction of LH that is released by a
        maximal dose of GnRH does vary positively with gonadotrope
        responsiveness [ 7 ] , and elucidation of the mechanisms
        altering the fraction of releasable LH is likely to
        illuminate mechanisms of gonadotrope responsiveness to GnRH
        [ 44 ] .
        Two molecular loci recently have been implicated as
        potential modulators of GnRH receptor signaling: one is the
        receptor itself [ 23 ] , and the other is the G protein
        that transduces the signal generated by binding of the
        receptor to its agonist [ 9 ] . With respect to the former
        locus, G protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) act in an
        agonist-specific manner to phosphorylate intracellular
        regions of the receptor thus permitting β arrestin binding
        that sterically inhibits G protein association with the
        receptor [ 1 45 ] . We have reported previously that
        experimental expression of GRKs in GnRH receptor-expressing
        heterologous cells (COS-1) suppressed GnRH-stimulated IP 
        3 production, and that co-expression of
        GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 suppressed GnRH receptor signaling
        more than that of either alone [ 23 ] . Stronger evidence
        that the GRK/β arrestin paradigm may play a role in
        regulating GnRH receptor signaling is our recent finding
        that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of GRK2 into normal
        pituitary gonadotropes suppressed GnRH-stimulated LH
        secretion and IP 
        3 production [ 31 ] . However, no
        evidence has been presented for a direct interaction
        between β-arrestin and the GnRH receptor.
        With respect to the G protein as a locus for modulation
        of GnRH receptor signaling, we reported earlier that
        experimental expression of RGS3 but not RGS1, 2, or 4 in
        GnRH receptor expressing COS-1 cells suppressed
        GnRH-stimulated IP 
        3 production [ 9 ] . In the current
        report, we present evidence strengthening the hypothesis of
        a regulatory role for RGS3 in GnRH receptor signaling:
        adenovirus-mediated expression of RGS3 in normal pituitary
        gonadotropes profoundly inhibited GnRH-stimulated LH
        secretion and 3H-inositol phosphate accumulation. Arguing
        for the specificity of this effect is the stimulation of LH
        secretion by a calcium ionophore and the failure of LH
        stores and GnRH-receptor binding to be affected by RGS3.
        Moreover, our finding that GnRH-stimulated IP 
        3 production was inhibited supports the
        locus of the RGS3 effect as residing at phospholipase C or
        earlier in the transduction pathway, most likely at the Gα
        protein because of our studies both earlier [ 9 ] and here
        showing that RGS3 binds Gqα 
        in vitro. Finally, the stronger
        inhibitory effect of RGS3T than RGS 3 on COS cell function
        was presumed to be true also for gonadotrope function and
        therefore was not tested here.
        The determination of RGS specificity for receptor-G
        protein pairs are currently unknown; i.e., we and others
        have found that several RGSs interact with Gqα but only
        one, RGS3, has potent inhibitory activity on GnRH receptor
        signaling. For instance, RGS4 and RGS-GAIP [ 11 ] , RGS3 [
        9 ] , RGS2 [ 46 ] , and RGS7 (our unpublished findings) all
        bind Gqα, the established G protein that transduces GnRH
        receptor signaling [ 38 ] . Nevertheless, RGS2 and 4 [ 9 ]
        , and RGS-GAIP and RGS7 (our unpublished data) are weak or
        null inhibitors of GnRH receptor signaling. A recent report
        seems to have clarified this issue: RGS4 must bind not only
        Gqα but also selected Gq-coupled receptors before it can
        inhibit receptor signaling [ 47 48 ] . Based on this
        finding, we propose that RGS3's binding to the GnRH
        receptor as well as to Gqα accounts for its specific
        inhibiting of GnRH receptor signaling.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The results of the current investigation as well as
        those presented earlier [ 31 ] nominate two molecular
        mechanisms as playing roles in setting the responsiveness
        level of GnRH receptor signaling; i.e., the RGS3 system
        acts at the G protein transducing step and the GRK/β
        arrestin system acts at the level of the receptor. Future
        studies must address whether both, neither, or only one of
        these mechanisms are physiologically relevant.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          cDNA transfection of COS-1 cells and measurement of
          IP 3production
          cDNA representing the rat GnRH receptor was cloned
          into pcDNA3 as described and validated previously [ 22 23
          ] . cDNAs representing RGS3 and RGS3T (RGS3 amino acids
          314-519) were cloned into the eukaryotic expression
          vector, rcCMV, as described [ 24 ] . COS-1 cells cultured
          as detailed before [ 23 ] were co-transfected with GnRH
          receptor cDNA and RGS3 or RGS3T cDNA using Lipofectamine
          (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) [ 23 ] , and 72 h
          later, treated with 10 -7M GnRH-A for 0, 10, 20, or 30
          sec before being collected for IP 
          3 measurements [ 22 23 ] .
          IP 
          3 measurements were performed on COS-1
          cell cytosolic preparations using a radioreceptor assay
          in which IP 
          3 and 3H-IP 
          3 compete for binding to IP 
          3 receptors prepared from calf
          cerebellum membranes [ 22 23 ] .
        
        
          RGS3 binding of Gα-proteins in vitro
          RGS3 protein fused to glutathione-S-transferase
          (RSG3-GST fusion protein) was produced in the pGEX-5x-1
          system of Pharmacia as detailed previously [ 9 ] .
          35S-Met labeled Gα-proteins were prepared 
          in vitro using a
          transcription/translation protocol [ 9 ] . cDNAs for Gqα
          [ 25 ] and Gzα [ 26 ] were obtained from M. I. Simon; for
          Gsα (ref. No. 63315) and Gi2α (ref. No. 63311) were
          obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
          (ATCC); for Gαo [ 27 ] was obtained from Eva G. Neer; for
          Gi1α, [ 28 ] from G. R. Post; and, for Gi3α [ 29 ] from
          M. G. Farquhar. Binding studies of recombinant RGS3-GST
          fusion protein to 35S-Met-Gα-proteins were performed as
          detailed [ 9 ] . Glutathione-coupled beads were used to
          select 35S-Gα proteins bound to RGS3-GST, and were then
          eluted for separation by SDS/PAGE [ 9 ] . The amount and
          molecular size of 35S-Gα protein were determined using a
          Phosphor imaging device (Molecular Dynamics).
        
        
          Preparation of Adeno-RGS3
          Recombinant adenovirus containing RGS3 cDNA was
          prepared using procedures previously described in detail
          by Becker 
          et al. [ 30 ] and by us [ 31 ] .
          Human RGS3 cDNA [ 24 ] was restricted from the pRC/CMV
          vector with EcoRI, and then subcloned into the
          corresponding site of the pACCMVpLpa plasmid. The proper
          orientation of the RGS3 cDNA was confirmed by nucleotide
          sequencing. The procedure for preparation of the
          adenovirus was co-transfection of a human embryonic
          kidney cell line (HEK 293) with the pACCMVpLpa plasmid
          and another plasmid (pJM17) containing most of the viral
          genome [ 30 ] . A relatively rare recombination of the
          two plasmids occurs in the HEK 293 cells that
          reconstitutes the adenoviral genome. The recombination
          event reconstituting adeno-RGS3 was confirmed using PCR
          analysis to detect the presence of RGS3 cDNA. Next,
          adeno-RGS3 was isolated by clonal selection in HEK 293
          cells followed by a second PCR to confirm the presence of
          RGS3 cDNA. Finally, large-scale amplification and
          titering of adeno-RGS3 was performed in HEK 293 cells.
          This virus preparation was used for infection of rat
          pituitary cells [ 31 ] .
        
        
          Culture and infection of rat pituitary cells
          Anterior pituitary glands were obtained from female
          Charles River CD rats that were maintained in accordance
          with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
          Animals using an experimental protocol that had been
          approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
          Committee. The pituitaries were dispersed with trypsin as
          described before [ 32 ] . The mono-dispersed cells were
          plated into poly-L-lysine coated 60 mm plastic Petri
          dishes in DMEM/10% gelding horse serum containing 10 -9M
          estradiol to optimize the GnRH-responsiveness of the
          gonadotropes [ 33 ] , and incubated overnight at 37°C in
          8% CO 
          2 -92% air.
          Pituitary cells were infected using a volume of
          adeno-RGS3 or adeno-β galactosidase necessary to achieve
          the chosen multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) diluted to
          0.3 ml; this was further diluted with 1.2 ml of TS buffer
          (8.0 gm/L NaCI, 380 mg/L KCl, 100 mg/L Na 
          2 HPO 
          4 , 3.0 gm/L Tris HCI, 200 mg/L CaCl 
          2 · 2H 
          2 O, 100 mg/L MgCl 
          2 · 6H 
          2 O; pH 7.4). The pituitary cell
          culture medium was aspirated and replaced with the virus
          solution, and the cells were incubated at 37°C in a CO 
          2 incubator for approximately 72
          h.
          Next, the cells were collected by trypsinization and
          counted using a hemocytometer; then, they were checked
          for viability using trypan blue [ 31 ] . The cells were
          replated for 2 h at 37°C in DMEM -0.1% bovine serum
          albumin (BSA) and subjected to x-gal staining for
          determination of the fraction of cells infected by the
          virus [ 31 ] , or to stimulation by GnRH-A for
          measurement of LH release.
        
        
          GnRH-stimulated LH secretion
          Pituitary cells that had been re-trypsinized 72 h
          after infection and then replated (100,000 cells/well in
          a 24-well poly-L-lysine coated plate) for a 2 h
          preincubation were subsequently treated with a GnRH
          agonist (1 ml of 10 -7M D-Ala 6- des Gly 10- GnRH
          ethylamide; GnRH-A, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or a calcium
          ionophore (A23187, Sigma) for 3 h as described by Conn 
          et al. [ 34 ] . The medium was
          removed and centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min to pellet
          any detached cells. The supernatant solution was either
          used immediately or stored at -20°C prior to RIA.
          LH RIAs were performed using reagents and instructions
          provided by Dr. A. F. Parlow on behalf of the National
          Hormone and Pituitary Program, National Institute of
          Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIH. Rat LH
          (NIDDK-rLH-l-9) was radioiodinated, the LH antiserum
          (NIDDK-anti-rLH-S-11) was prepared in rabbits, and the
          reference standard was NIDDK-rLH-RP3. The mean EC 
          50 of the standard curves (n = 10) was
          0.59 ng with a coefficient of variation of 4.4%.
        
        
          GNRH-stimulated 3H-inositol phosphate accumulation
          in pituitary cells
          Total [ 3H] inositol phosphate accumulation was
          determined in [ 3H] myoinositol-labeled pituitary cells
          as described earlier [ 22 ] . At 48 h after infection of
          the pituitary cells, the incubation medium was removed
          and replaced with a balanced salt solution (10 mM Hepes,
          pH7.4, 135 mM NaCI, 4.5 mM KCL, 1.5 mM CaCl 
          2 , 0.5 mM MgCL 
          2 , 1.0 mM NaH 
          2 PO4, 5.6 mM glucose, 0.3% BSA, and
          10 -9M estradiol) containing 5 μCi of [
          3H]-myoinositol/ml of medium. After a further 24 h, the
          pituitary cells were recovered by trypinization, counted,
          and replated in balanced salt solution (400,000 - 500,000
          cells/well in a 24-well plate) for a 2 h preincubation.
          Then, the cells were stimulated with GnRH-A (10 -7M for
          one hr) in the presence of 5 mM LiCI. [ 3H]-inositol
          phosphate accumulation in the cells was then measured
          using ion exchange chromatography followed by liquid
          scintillation spectroscopy [ 22 ] .
        
        
          Immunoblots for RGS3
          An antibody to hexa-histidine-tagged human RGS3T was
          prepared in chickens. RGS3T [ 24 ] is the carboxy
          terminal 206 amino acids (a.a. 314-519) of RGS3 and is
          represented by nt 1227-1847 of RGS3 cDNA (Genbank
          Accession #U27655). To prepare hexa-histidine amino
          terminally-tagged RGS3T, we modified RGS3T cDNA [ 24 ]
          using PCR with primers containing restriction sites (the
          5' primer incorporated a Bam HI site, whereas the 3'
          primer bore an Nde 1 site). The PCR product was then
          cloned into the pET15b vector which carries an N-terminal
          Histag sequence followed by BamH1 and Nde 1 cloning sites
          (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI). The resulting plasmid DNA
          was nucleotide-sequenced to confirm the presence of RGS3T
          cDNA. The cDNA was then used to transform 
          E. coli of the BL21(DE3) strain.
          Protein induction was performed using
          isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as described
          by Novagen Inc. Inclusion bodies containing the protein
          were prepared and then solubized in 6 M guanidine. The
          Histag RGS3T protein was purified on a Ni 2+resin using a
          Pharmacia Hi-Trap 1 ml Chelating Column (Pharmacia
          Biotech, Piscataway, NJ).
          Antibodies to Histag RGS3T protein were prepared in
          chickens (Aves Labs, Inc., Tigard, OR). A chicken was
          injected with 145 μg of RGS3T into the breast muscle on
          four separate occasions; the first injection was in
          complete Freund's adjuvant, whereas injections 2-4 were
          made in a 1:1 dilution of complete and incomplete
          Freund's adjuvant. One week after the last injection, 6
          immune eggs were collected, and the IgY fraction purified
          from the 6 eggs as well as from 3 pre-immune eggs
          collected from the same hen.
          Immunoblots for RGS3 expression in pituitary cells
          were performed as described previously by us [ 22 23 ] .
          In brief, rat pituitary cells at 72 h after adeno-RGS3
          infection (5 M.O.I.) were collected by trypsinization,
          homogenized, and a protein determination made. Fifty μg
          protein samples were heated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer
          containing β-mercaptoethanol and then electrophoresed on
          a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were
          electroblotted onto nylon membranes (Millipore Corp.,
          Bedford, MA) which were then incubated for 2 h in a
          blocking solution containing 5% non-fat dry milk in
          phosphate buffered saline containing 0.02% Tween-20. The
          primary antibody (chicken IgY, 62.5 μg/ml) was diluted in
          blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4°C with the
          nylon membrane. Blots were then incubated for 2 h at room
          temperature in alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat
          anti-chicken IgY (0.1 μg/ml diluted in blocking solution;
          Aves Labs, Tigard, OR). Color development was achieved by
          incubating the membrane in substrate
          [(5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl
          phosphate-nitrobluetetra-zolium chloride)
          (BCIP-NBT)].
        
        
          Assay of LH contents in pituitary cells
          For LH RIA measurements of cell contents, 1 × 10
          5anterior pituitary cells infected, or not, 72 h
          previously with adeno-RGS3 or adeno-βgal were trypsinized
          and plated for 2 h. LH was extracted from the cells [ 36
          ] by removing and discarding the medium and adding 1 ml
          extraction buffer (150 mM NaCI, 50 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA,
          and 1 mM bacitracin, pH 7.4) followed by freeze-thawing
          twice. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed
          and subjected to LH RIA as described above.
        
        
          Measurements of GnRH receptors by receptor
          radioassay (RRA)
          About 3 × 10 6pituitary cells infected, or not, 72 h
          previously with adeno-βgal or adeno-RGS3 were
          trypsinized, and cell membranes containing the GnRH
          receptors were prepared by placing the cells in a Dounce
          homogenizer (Kontes Co., Vineland, NJ) and disrupting
          them with 30 strokes of the pestle. The cell membranes
          were pelleted by centrifugation at 26,000 × 
          g and then resuspended in 10 mM
          Tris buffer. The GnRH RRA on the membranes was performed
          as described previously [ 22 23 ] . Cell membranes and 1
          × 10 5cpm [ 125I]GnRH-A were incubated at 0°C for 90 min.
          Nonspecific binding was determined as counts per min
          bound in the presence of 10 -6M unlabeled GnRH-A. Bound
          and free [ 125I]GnRH-A were separated by filtration. The
          filters were counted by γ-scintillation spectrometry.
        
        
          Data analysis
          The results are presented as the mean ± SEM of at
          least three independent experiments unless indicated
          otherwise. The statistical tests were one-way or two-way
          analyses of variance with significant differences (p <
          0.05) identified by the Student - Newman-Keuls method.
          Statistical analysis was performed using Sigma Stat
          Statistical Software for Windows (Jandel Scientific, San
          Rafael, CA).
