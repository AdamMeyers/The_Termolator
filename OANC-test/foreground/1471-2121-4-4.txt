        The secreted glycoproteins in the Wnt/Wingless (Wg)
        family serve diverse functions in developmental processes,
        ranging from cell fate specification and cell proliferation
        to cell migration and cell polarity [ 1 2 ] , and
        deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway can lead to
        cancer [ 3 4 ] . In a simplified model of the canonical
        Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, the binding of Wnts to
        their receptors activates a downstream component,
        Dishevelled (Dsh). Dsh in turn inhibits glycogen synthase
        kinase (GSK)-3β in the β-catenin destruction complex, which
        mainly consists of Axin, GSK-3β, adenomatous polyposis coli
        (APC) and β-catenin. Consequently, the level of cytoplasmic
        β-catenin rises, and stabilized β-catenin, together with
        the transcriptional factor LEF/TCF, regulates the
        transcription of Wnt target genes.
        The mechanism by which the Wnt signal is transduced
        through its transmembrane receptors is not clear. Wnt
        proteins have been shown to bind to Frizzleds (Fzs), which
        are seven-transmembrane receptors [ 5 6 ] . The binding of
        Wnts occurs within an aminoterminal cysteine-rich-domain
        (CRD) of Fzs. At least 11 vertebrate and 4 
        Drosophila Fz genes
        http://www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wntwindow.htmlhave been
        identified. However, their functions and ligand
        specificities remain to be understood. Recently, it was
        reported that two single-transmembrane proteins of the
        LDL-receptor-related proteins (LRP) family, LRP5 and LRP6,
        are also involved in receiving the Wnt signal [ 7 8 9 ] . 
        Drosophila Arrow (Arr), which is
        homologous to murine and human LRP5 and LRP6, was shown to
        be essential for Wg signaling. Genetic data from flies and
        mice indicate that Arr and LRP6 play a positive role in Wnt
        signaling [ 7 9 ] . A genetic epistasis experiment placed
        Arr between Wg and Dsh [ 9 ] , acting in parallel or
        downstream of DFz. In addition, LRP6 has been reported to
        bind Wnt-1 and to associate with Fz in a Wnt-dependent
        manner [ 8 ] . Taken together, these results support a
        co-receptor model: upon exposure to Wnts, LRP5 or LRP6
        forms a complex with Wnt and Fzs, transducing the Wnt
        signal downstream to stabilize cytoplasmic β-catenin.
        Consistent with this, it has been demonstrated that
        Dickkopf-1 inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling by binding to
        LRP5 or LRP6 to prevent Wnt-receptor complex formation [ 10
        11 12 ] .
        Alternatively, however, it is possible that Wnt/Wg can
        signal through LRP/Arr in the absence of Fzs. In agreement
        with this possibility, an intracellular domain of LRP5 was
        reported to interact directly with Axin [ 13 ] , and Wnt
        signaling appears to stimulate the recruitment of Axin to
        LRP5 at the membrane, where Axin is degraded. Furthermore,
        it was reported that LRP signaling can be activated in a
        Dsh - independent fashion [ 14 ] . These data suggest that
        Wnt/Wg could signal through LRP directly to the β-catenin
        destruction complex in a Fz- and Dsh-independent
        fashion.
        To evaluate whether Fzs are required for the
        transduction of Wnt/Wg signaling in the presence of LRPs,
        we have established a sensitive method to measure Wg
        signaling activities using a LEF-luciferase reporter in 
        Drosophila S2 cells. We show that
        DFz2 and LRP/Arr cooperate with Wg to activate the
        signaling pathway. Using a double-strand RNA interference
        (dsRNAi) technique designed to eliminate specific proteins
        [ 15 16 ] , such as Arr, DFz2 and Dsh, we have developed
        strong evidence that Wg requires both types of receptors to
        transduce a signal efficiently through Dsh to stabilize
        β-catenin.
      
      
        Results
        
          Wg and its receptors Arr and DFz2 can activate
          LEF-dependent transcription
          We wished to ask whether Wnt/Wg can signal through
          LRP/Arrow in the absence of Fz. Since 4 Fz genes have
          been identified in 
          Drosophila , compared to 11 Fz
          genes in vertebrates, we decided to use 
          Drosophila S2 cells for these
          experiments. In earlier reports, Northern blot
          hybridization and RT-PCR failed to detect DFz1, DFz2, and
          DFz3 in S2 cells [ 6 17 18 ] . Using a one-step RT-PCR
          assay to measure the expression levels of all 4 DFzs and
          Arr in the same S2 cells used by Yanagawa 
          et al . (Figure 1A), we detected
          DFz2, DFz3, and Arr mRNAs, but not DFz1 and DFz4 mRNAs
          after 40 cycles of amplification. In contrast, in mbn-2
          cells all 4 DFzs mRNAs were detected by this procedure.
          No PCR products were found when reverse transcriptase was
          omitted from the reactions, eliminating the possibility
          that the results were due to contamination with genomic
          DNA. All of the PCR products were gel-purified and
          sequenced to confirm that they contain the expected Fz
          sequences (data not shown). Thus S2 cells express mRNAs
          for Arr, DFz2 and DFz3, but mRNAs for DFz1 and DFz4 are
          either absent or below levels required for detection with
          our RT-PCR assay.
          Previous studies have measured the abundance of
          Armadillo (Arm), a 
          Drosophila homologue of β-catenin,
          to assess Wg signaling in S2 cells. We adapted a
          LEF-luciferase reporter system [ 19 ] to monitor
          β-catenin-mediated Wg signaling in S2 cells, a more
          quantitative and convenient assay. The luciferase
          reporter plasmid, which has multiple LEF-1 binding sites,
          was cotransfected into S2 cells with the coding sequence
          for mouse LEF-1 in the 
          Drosophila expression vector
          pPacPL. 
          Renilla luciferase was included as
          a transfection control. The activation of Wnt signaling
          by various effectors in pPacPL was then determined by
          measurement of relative luciferase activity (Figure
          1B).
          Transient transfection of a Wg expression plasmid
          activated LEF-dependent transcription 34-fold; this
          result was not changed by co-transfection with an Arr
          plasmid (which also had no effect in the absence of Wg),
          implying either that Arr levels were not limiting or that
          Arr was not required for Wg effects. In contrast,
          co-transfection with a DFz2 plasmid augmented Wg
          signaling more than 1000-fold above control levels and
          about 30-fold above levels observed with Wg alone,
          suggesting that DFz2 was required for efficient Wg
          signaling and, although detectable in S2 cells, was
          present in limiting amounts. The DFz2 plasmid had a small
          but significant effect without addition of Wg, but the
          addition of Arr plasmid had little or no effect on DFz2
          activity in the presence or absence of Wg plasmid (Figure
          1B).
        
        
          Wg signaling is impaired with the loss of function
          of DFz2 or Arr
          Results in the preceding section indicate that DFz2
          has an important role in transducing a Wg signal in S2
          cells, but do not reveal whether Arr also has a role in
          concert with, or independent of, Fz-mediated signaling.
          To explore these issues, we used dsRNAi to reduce the
          levels of Arr and DFz2 RNAs in S2 cells in which Wg
          signaling was stimulated, since others have shown that
          the expression of endogenous genes in these cells can be
          eliminated or reduced by direct application of
          T7-transcribed dsRNAs [ 15 16 ] . Using this approach
          (Figure 2), we found that the previously observed,
          approximately 30-fold stimulation of luciferase activity
          by the Wg expression plasmid was reduced by 70% or more
          when S2 cells were co-transfected with inhibitory RNAs
          for Arr, DFz2, or both (Figure 2A), implying that
          endogenous levels of both types of receptor are required
          for an efficient response to Wg. The extensive inhibition
          with either RNA species favors the idea that Wg signaling
          requires coordinated rather than independent actions of
          endogenous Arr and DFz2 receptors. However, the failure
          to eliminate signaling entirely with inhibitory RNAs
          against both receptors cannot be readily interpreted,
          since it is unlikely that receptor production was
          eliminated in every cell in the cultures.
          Importantly, the synergistic effect of co-transfected
          Wg and DFz2 plasmids, approximately 1000-fold, was also
          dramatically reduced by addition of inhibitory RNA
          against Arr (Figure 2B), implying that endogenous Arr is
          required for the stimulatory effect of exogenous DFz2 on
          Wg signaling. This result also suggests that DFz2 and Arr
          work cooperatively to transduce a Wg signal. As
          additional controls in these experiments, we showed that
          inhibitory RNA against Dsh, a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein
          believed to mediate Wg signaling via Fz receptors, blocks
          about 60% of signaling produced by co-transfection with
          Wg and DFz2 plasmids. Moreover, we found that S2 cells
          treated with dsRNAi against both Arr and Dsh further
          impaired the Wg and DFz2 signaling activity up to 95%
          (Figure 2B). As expected, inhibitory RNAs against Arr and
          DFz2 have no effect on luciferase synthesis promoted by a
          degradation-resistant mutant of β-catenin (Figure
          2C).
        
        
          The synergy between Wg and DFz2 requires the CRD
          domain of DFz2, but not the carboxyterminus
          DFz2, like other members of the Fz protein family,
          contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) near the
          aminoterminus, followed by a seven-transmembrane (7-TM)
          domain and a cytoplasmic carboxyterminal tail. DFz2
          reportedly binds to Wg through its CRD domain [ 6 ] , but
          it is not known which proteins interact with the
          carboxyterminus or with cytoplasmic loops in the 7-TM
          region of DFz2 to transduce the signal to the cytoplasmic
          signaling component Dsh. However, a short conserved
          cytoplasmic motif in the carboxylterminal region of Fzs,
          including DFz2, was reported to be important for the
          activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mammalian cells,
          based on mutational analysis [ 20 ] .
          To determine which domains in DFz2 are important for
          its synergistic activity with Wg in the S2 cell assay, we
          deleted the regions encoding the CRD domain (DFz2ΔCRD) or
          the cytoplasmic tail (DFz2ΔC) in pPacPL (Figure 3A) and
          tested the deletion constructs shown in panel A in the
          luciferase assay described earlier (Figure 3B). In this
          experiment, a Wg plasmid activated the luciferase
          reporter only 12-fold above the vector control; wild-type
          DFz2 plasmid alone stimulated luciferase levels 7-fold,
          but neither deletion mutant of DFz2 had any effect,
          consistent with an earlier report that DFz2 with a
          truncated carboxyterminus fails to induce the expression
          of 
          Xnr/Siamois [ 21 ] . However,
          DFz2ΔC stimulated signaling over 700-fold when delivered
          in concert with Wg, a synergistic effect nearly as strong
          as observed with wild type DFz2 (nearly 1700-fold in this
          experiment). In contrast, DFz2ΔCRD showed no synergistic
          effect, a result that can most likely be explained by a
          loss of Wg binding capacity. The result with DFz2ΔC,
          however, implies that the Wg signal can be transduced
          through DFz2 in a carboxyterminus-independent manner,
          either through the 7-TM domain or through the interaction
          with Arr that was implied by the previous experiments. In
          addition, the synergistic effect of Wg and DFz2ΔC was
          blocked by Dsh dsRNAi (data not shown), implying that Dsh
          is required to transduce the signal from Wg through
          DFz2ΔC to β-catenin. Therefore, the interaction between
          DFz2 and Dsh does not depend solely on the
          carboxyterminus of DFz2.
        
        
          LRP6 and an aminoterminal mutant of LRP6 can
          stimulate the Wg signaling pathway, but the ability of
          LRP6 to replace the requirement for Arrow in the synergy
          between Wg and DFz2 requires the aminoterminus of
          LRP6
          LRPs have been shown to bind to Wnt/Wg through the
          first and second EGF repeats of their extracellular
          domain [ 11 ] . Our unpublished work in mammalian cells
          and results from others [ 11 13 ] demonstrate that the
          expression of LRP6 or an aminoterminal truncation mutant
          (LRP6ΔN), which should no longer bind to Wnt, can
          activate the Wnt signaling pathway.
          To investigate whether these constructs can also
          function in S2 cells and whether their activities can
          synergize with Wg, we transferred LRP6 and LRP6ΔN into
          the 
          Drosophila expression vector pPacPL
          (Figure 4A) and tested them alone and with various
          combinations of Wg and DFz2 in S2 cells (Figure 4B).
          Results with Wg and DFz2 alone or together were similar
          to those observed in other experiments (e.g. Figure 1),
          but both wild-type and mutant LRP6, unlike the LRP
          homolog Arr, activated signaling about 10- to 15-fold
          alone, 2- to 4-fold when co-transfected with Wg, and 4-
          to10-fold when co-transfected with DFz2.
          Since we have been unable to measure Arr or LRP
          proteins directly in transfected cells, we cannot
          distinguish between more efficient expression or greater
          inherent activity of the LRPs as an explanation of the
          different effects of LRPs and Arr. Signaling via LRP6ΔN,
          however, while dependent on Arm as expected, is not
          dependent on Dsh or DFz2, as judged by the use of dsRNAi
          (Figure 5A). Similar results were observed for
          full-length LRP6 (Figure 5B). These results are
          consistent with claims that LRPs can signal through an
          interaction of the carboxyterminus with Axin [ 13 ] .
          To ask whether LRP6 can replace the requirement for
          endogenous Arr in the synergy between Wg and DFz2, as
          observed earlier in Figure 2B, we again used Arr-specific
          dsRNAi to try to block the strong activation of signaling
          by Wg plus DFz2, in the presence and absence of the LRP6
          constructs (Figure 5C). Again, Arr dsRNAi markedly
          inhibited signaling by Wg and DFz2, but no inhibition was
          observed in the presence of the LRP6 plasmid, implying
          the LRP6 could substitute for Arr in these synergistic
          events. In contrast, LRP6ΔN cannot effectively substitute
          for Arr, presumably reflecting a need for an interaction
          of the LRP family member with Wg to achieve synergy. Some
          residual activity in this experiment may reflect the
          inherent Wg signaling activity of wild type and mutant
          LRPs observed in Figure 4B.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this report, we describe a convenient cell
        culture-based assay for assessing the contributions made by
        candidate components of Wnt signaling pathways to the
        activation of the β-catenin-mediated branch. We have
        attempted to alter the concentrations of components by
        transient transfection with plasmids encoding wild type and
        mutant proteins and/or with dsRNAi that can block
        production of proteins from endogenous or exogenous genes.
        Pathway activity was then assessed by measurement of
        luciferase expressed from a co-transfected plasmid
        containing firefly luciferase-coding sequence under the
        control of LEF binding elements.
        The assay makes use of 
        Drosophila S2 cells in which two of
        the four fly Frizzled proteins are undetectable by a
        sensitive PCR assay. Two others (DFz2 and 3) are detectable
        (Figure 1A), but DFz2 is in limiting quantities, since
        signaling by Wg, the Drosophila ortholog of mammalian
        Wnt-1, can be dramatically stimulated by co-transfection
        with a DFz2 expression plasmid (Figure 1B). This effect
        requires the aminoterminus of DFz2, implying a requirement
        for binding Wg to the Fz CRD, but not the carboxyterminus,
        suggesting that the signal may be, in part, transmitted
        through an interaction of Wg-Frizzled complex with another
        protein.
        Arrow, the fly homolog of the LRPs, which are thought to
        be Wnt co-receptors in mammalian cells, is an obvious
        candidate for such an interactive protein. Experiments with
        Arr dsRNAi clearly establish a requirement for endogenous
        Arr to generate the synergistic response to exogenous Wg
        plus DFz2 in S2 cells (Figure 2). We have also found that
        mammalian LRP6 can replace the need for Arr in this context
        (Figure 4) and that the aminoterminus of LRP6 must be
        maintained for most or all of the effect. Therefore it is
        most likely that Wg, DFz2 and LRP/Arr form a trimeric
        ligand-receptor complex to activate the signaling pathway.
        However, it was recently reported that no direct
        interactions between Arrow and Wg were detected [ 22 ] . It
        is possible that LRP aminoterminus is required for
        interacting with another extracellular protein rather than
        Wnt and Fz.
        It is known that Dsh is a key component in transducing a
        Wg signal [ 23 24 25 ] . However, the mechanism by which
        Dsh transmits a signal to the β-catenin destruction complex
        is not clear. Fzs can recruit Dsh to the plasma membrane [
        21 26 ] , but it is not known whether this recruitment is
        essential in signaling. While the functions of Fz and Dsh
        remain to be clarified, it is possible that upon Wnt
        signaling, Fzs recruit Dsh to the membrane and Dsh brings
        Axin to the carboxyterminus of LRPs. If the carboxyterminus
        of LRP6 can interact with Axin independently of DFz2 and
        Dsh, it might reduce the cytoplasmic level of Axin and help
        stabilize β-catenin. The observation that LRP5ΔN activates
        the Wnt/Wg signaling pathway in a Dsh-independent manner [
        14 ] , and our data with overexpressed LRP6ΔN and LRP6,
        further support this proposal.
        The LEF-dependent luciferase assay in S2 cells is
        versatile, dynamic, rapid and can provide important clues
        about interactions important for Wnt signaling. The use of
        dsRNAi helps to refine the nature of such interactions and
        their effects on downstream events in the signaling
        circuitry. Because we have not, however, measured the
        concentrations of the relevant signaling components or
        studied interactions of these components with more
        sophisticated tools, the conclusions we draw are
        provisional and require additional support. However, they
        are consistent with the prevailing model in which Wg forms
        a trimeric complex with Arr and DFz2 that transduces a
        signal through Dsh to activate LEF/TCF-responsive
        promoters.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We conclude that Wnt/Wg signaling requires functional
        interactions of both LRP/Arr and Fz classes of receptors,
        and the cytoplasmic component Dsh. The extracellular
        regions of both receptors are crucial for receiving the Wg
        signal, while the carboxyterminus of DFz2 is not absolutely
        required for reception of the Wnt/Wg signal.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cell culture, transfection and luciferase
          assay
          S2 cells were cultured at room temperature in 
          Drosophila Schneider medium
          supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
          serum. The following plasmids were used in each
          experiment: 0.1 μg LEF-luciferase reporter [ 19 ] , 0.2
          μg mouse LEF-1 and 0.1 μg 
          Renilla luciferase. 
          Renilla luciferase was included in
          each transfection to control the efficiency of
          transfection. All 
          Drosophila expression constructs
          were cloned in the vector pPacPL [ 27 28 ] . Cells grown
          in 6-well plates were transfected with 0.5 μg of
          indicated plasmid together with the reporter plasmids
          using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies).
          The final amount of DNA was adjusted to an equal level
          using pPacPL vector DNA. Approximately 48 hours after
          transfection, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer
          (Promega) by shaking at room temperature for 30 minutes.
          The luciferase activities of the lysates were then
          analyzed by a luminometer (EG&G Berthold, lumat
          LB9507) to measure the dual luciferase activities of
          LEF-luciferase reporter and 
          Renilla luciferase using the
          Promega Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system. All the
          experiments were performed at least three times, and each
          time in triplicates.
        
        
          RT-PCR
          RNA from S2 cells and mbn-2 cells was prepared using
          Qiagen RNA miniprep columns and was treated with RQ1
          RNase-Free DNase (Promega). 0.1 μg RNA from each cell
          line was used as a template for one-step RT-PCR (One-step
          RT-PCR kit from Invitrogen). The following primers were
          used in the reactions: 
          DFz1 : 5' primer,
          5'-ATGTGGCGTCAAATCCTG-3'; 3' primer,
          5'-TGGACATCATCTGCAGGC-3'. 
          DFz2 : 5' primer,
          5'-AGACACAATCGACTGAAGG-3'; 3' primer,
          5'-AGTGAGGTTCATGTACCAG-3' (These two primer pairs are
          based on [ 18 ] ). 
          DFz3 : 5' primer,
          5'-ACAGTGAAGAGTAGTGGTCG-3'; 3' primer,
          5'-CCACCTCCTGTGGAATCTGC-3', 
          DFz4 : 5' primer,
          5'-TACATTCGCTAAGGCTAC-3'; 3' primer,
          5'-GACCTTCCATACACATCG-3' and 
          Arr : 5' primer,
          5'-GAAGATGTGACAACGAAAGC-3'; 3' primer,
          5'-CATGCTCTGACAGAGTTCG-3'.
        
        
          RNAi in S2 cells
          The method was adapted from the procedure published by
          the Dixon lab [ 15 16 ] . PCR reactions were performed
          using primers containing the T7 polymerase binding site.
          We used dsRNA against a gene unrelated to the Wg
          signaling pathway, i.e. Aconitase (Aco), as a negative
          control. The primers used are:
          
          Aco : 5' primer,
          5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACTCTGTCCAAGTTCGACTCG-3'; 3'
          primer,
          5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGATAGAGTCAACACCCTTGC-3'; 
          DFz2 : 5' primer,
          5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGATCACCATACCAATGTGTCG-3';
          3' primer,
          5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGTATGCCGCAGTTTGGAACG-3'; 
          Arr : 5' primer,
          5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACAGATCGATGTGATCGTTAGG-3';
          3' primer,
          5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCATGCTCTGACAGAGTTCG-3'; 
          Dsh : 5' primer,
          5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCATCACCAGAAGATGATGG-3'; 3'
          primer,
          5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCTTAACGATCTCCTCGAGG-3'; 
          Arm : 5' primer,
          5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACAGCTAAGCCAGACACGTTC-3'; 3'
          primer,
          5'-GGATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGCTTTCCTGGTTGCCGTAGG-3'.
          A megascript T7 transcription kit (Ambion) was used to
          generate both sense and antisense strand RNA. The RNA was
          annealed to form double strand RNA. 15 μg of each dsRNA
          was then added to S2 cells in 6-well plates containing 10
          6cells per well. 8 to 16 hours after dsRNAi treatment,
          cells were transfected with different constructs and
          reporters. 48 hours after transfection, cells were lysed
          and luciferase activity was measured as above.
