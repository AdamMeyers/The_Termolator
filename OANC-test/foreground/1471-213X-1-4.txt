        The Cre- 
        loxP site specific recombination
        system [ 1] is widely used for production of
        tissue-specific and conditional knockout alleles in mice [
        2, 3]. Recently, a Cre-dependent 
        lacZ reporter strain (R26R) was
        produced by targeted insertion of a lacZ gene, preceded by
        a loxP-flanked (floxed) strong transcriptional termination
        sequence (tpA), into the ubiquitously expressed ROSA26
        locus [ 4, 5]. The 
        R26R allele terminates transcription
        prematurely, but when the mice are crossed with
        Cre-expressing transgenic mice, the Cre-mediated excision
        of the floxed termination sequence leads to constitutive 
        lacZ expression. Thus, these doubly
        transgenic animals express 
        lacZ only in the cells that have
        expressed Cre, as well as in all of their daughter cells.
        Similar Cre reporter strains have been produced using
        different promoters to express 
        lacZ [ [ 6 7 8 9 ] ], Another
        variation on this theme has been the development of the
        Z/AP reporter strain, which switches from lacZ to alkaline
        phosphatase expression upon exposure to Cre recombinase
        activity [ 10]. All of these strains are useful for
        monitoring the expression of Cre recombinase, as well as
        for cell lineage tagging experiments [ 9, [ 11 12 13 14 ]
        ].
        Here, we describe the production of two similar Cre
        reporter alleles that express enhanced yellow or cyan
        fluorescent protein (EYFP or ECFP), two color variants of
        the green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP and its variants
        are autofluorescent proteins that can be visualized in
        living cells, and are therefore particularly useful for
        monitoring gene expression in whole embryos, animals or
        cultured cells and organs [ 15]. EYFP and ECFP were chosen
        because their emission spectra overlap minimally, so they
        can be distinguished when used simultaneously, whereas the
        emission spectra of EYFP and ECFP overlap to a greater
        extent with that of EGFP [ 16, 17]
        http://www.clontech.com/gfp/pdf/LivingColors.pdf.
        During the course of this work, three new Cre reporter
        strains that conditionally express EGFP were reported. Two
        transgenic strains [ 18, 19] use the β-actin promoter/CMV
        enhancer to express EGFP following Cre-mediated excision of
        a stop sequence, and in one of these, lacZ is expressed
        prior to the Cre-mediated excision event. In the third
        strain, which is similar in principle to the YFP and CFP
        alleles reported here, EGFP was inserted at the 
        ROSA26 locus [ 20]. The availability
        of different Cre reporter strains will be valuable, not
        only because of the advantages of different reporter
        proteins, but also because the efficiency of Cre-mediated
        excision may be dependent on the target locus.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        Considering the utility of the 
        ROSA26 locus for expressing various
        sequences in a ubiquitous manner [ 4, 5, 21], we generated
        a generic targeting vector (pBigT), into which any sequence
        of interest can easily be inserted downstream of a floxed
        neo-tpA cassette, and then subsequently cloned into a
        plasmid with the 
        ROSA26 genomic flanking arms. 
        ECFP or 
        EYFP was inserted into pBigT, and the
        resulting sequence was inserted into a vector containing 
        ROSA26 genomic sequences to permit
        homologous recombination (Fig 1A). The targeting vector was
        electroporated into ES cells, and 27 G418-resistant
        colonies were analyzed for each construct. Three R26R-EYFP
        and two R26R-ECFP colonies carried the targeted allele, as
        determined by Southern blot hybridization (Figure 1B). The
        targeted ES cells, originally derived from strain 129X1/SvJ
        [ 22], were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, and the
        resulting chimeric mice were bred to C57BL/6J females to
        pass the mutation through the germ line. Thus, the
        resulting mice were a mixture of strains 129X1/SvJ and
        C57BL/6J.
        No background expression of EYFP or ECFP could be
        detected in the R26R-EYFP or R26R-ECFP mice, as expected
        (data not shown), due to the strong transcriptional stop
        sequence inserted between the promoter and the coding
        sequences. However, when the reporter mice were crossed to
        β-actin-Cre transgenic mice [ 23], which express Cre
        constitutively in most or all cells including those in the
        early embryo, the resulting doubly transgenic embryos
        displayed apparently ubiquitous expression of EYFP or ECFP
        (Figure 2), indicating efficient excision of the floxed
        stop sequence. The expression of EYFP vs. ECFP could be
        clearly distinguished using appropriate filter sets (Fig
        2). This ubiquitous expression of EYFP or ECFP was
        heritably transmitted to the following generations (data
        not shown), resulting in ubiquitously expressing lines of
        mice that will be useful for lineage tracing in chimeric
        mice or embryos, analogous to the original ROSA26 lacZ
        promoter trap strain [ 21].
        The specificity of the R26R-EYFP and ECFP lines was
        tested by crossing them with strains of mice that express
        Cre in a tissue-specific fashion. Isl1 is a LIM homeodomain
        transcription factor expressed in motor neurons and dorsal
        root and cranial sensory ganglia [ 24]. Isl1-Cre mice were
        produced by targeting 
        Cre into the 
        Isl1 locus (see Materials and
        Methods). Heterozygous Isl1-Cre mice were viable and
        fertile, while homozygous mice died at E9-E10.5, as has
        been previously described with mice in which the exon
        encoding the second LIM domain of Isl1 had been deleted [
        25]. Figure 3Ashows an experiment in which the R26R-YFP
        mice were crossed with the Isl1-Cre mice, resulting in
        expression of EYFP in motor neurons and dorsal root ganglia
        in the doubly transgenic offspring. Thus R26R-YFP mice
        faithfully report the cell-specific patterns of Isl1/Cre in
        subsets of neurons. As a control, the Isl-1/Cre mice were
        also mated to the original 
        R26R lacZ allele [ 4], resulting in a
        similar pattern of expression of 
        lacZ .
        Engrailed-1 (En-1) is a homeodomain protein expressed
        specifically at the mid-hindbrain junction of the early
        somite stage embryo, as well as in a number of sites later
        in embryogenesis. Figure 4shows an experiment in which
        R26R-YFP mice were crossed with a strain of mice in which
        Cre was knocked into the 
        En-1 locus [ 26], resulting in the
        expression of YFP specifically at the mid-hindbrain
        junction in an E8.5 embryo. For comparison, we also crossed
        the En-1/Cre mice with the original 
        R26R lacZ allele [ 4], resulting in
        lacZ expression in the same region at E8.5 (Fig 4C).
        The expression of ECFP proved more difficult to detect
        in fixed and sectioned tissue (data not shown), although it
        was clearly detectable in unfixed embryonic tissue (Fig
        2C). This is not surprising, given the higher quantum yield
        and extinction coefficient of EYFP as compared to ECFP,
        both of which result in higher fluorescence intensity.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have constructed two reporter lines of mice that
        express EYFP or ECFP only in cells expressing the Cre
        recombinase, and their daughter cells, by targeting these
        cDNAs into the ubiquitously expressed ROSA26 locus,
        preceded by a 
        loxP flanked "stop" sequence. Crosses
        with a general Cre expressing strain (βactin-Cre) and two
        tissue-specific Cre strains (Isl1-Cre and En1-Cre) showed
        that the reporter strains function as expected, based on
        their similarity to the well characterized R26R-lacZ
        strains. In contrast to 
        lacZ expression, which cannot be
        easily detected in living tissue, the EYFP and ECFP
        reporter strains (together with the GFP reporter strains
        currently available) will be very useful for monitoring the
        expression of Cre in living tissues, or tracing the lineage
        of these cells and their descendants, in cultured embryos
        or organs. Furthermore, by using modified forms of Cre
        whose recombinase activity is inducible, one can use these
        reporter mice to perform detailed analysis on the lineage
        of cells at different time points during development.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Sources of Plasmids
          The components of the 
          ROSA26 targeting vectors were a
          gift from Philippe Soriano. The adenovirus splice
          acceptor (SA) and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation
          sequence (bpA) were from plasmid pSAβgeo [ 21]. The 
          loxP flanked neo cassette, and
          trimer of the SV40 polyadenylation sequence (tpA), were
          from plasmid PGKneotpAlox2 [ 4]. The 
          ROSA26 genomic sequence and the
          diphtheria toxin (DTA) expression cassette were from
          plasmid pROSA26-1 [ 4], and the template for the external
          probe used to genotype ES cells was from plasmid
          pROSA26-5' [ 4].
          The plasmids pEYFP-N1 and pECFP containing cDNA for
          EYFP and ECFP were purchased from Clontech Laboratories
          Inc.
        
        
          Targeting Constructs
          The plasmid pBigT consists of the adenovirus splice
          acceptor sequence followed by a 
          loxP site, neo expression cassette,
          strong transcriptional stop sequence (triple SV40
          polyadenylation sequence), another 
          loxP site in the same orientation
          as the first, a multiple cloning site (MCS), and the
          bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence. A PacI
          site was included 5' to the SA, and an AscI site 3' to
          the bpA. These two enzymes are rare eight base pair
          cutters and result in sticky ends upon digestion and can
          be used to excise the entire construct, for insertion
          into the plasmid with the 
          ROSA26 genomic arms. The XbaI site
          used for insertion into the 
          ROSA26 genomic locus [ 4] was
          replaced by a linker (PacI, SwaI, AscI), so that it could
          be digested with PacI and AscI, and receive the bigT
          sequence.
          To make pBigT, plasmid pSAβgeo was digested with ClaI
          and XbaI to remove the 
          βgeo and bpA sequence but leave
          behind the SA, the ends were Klenow filled and the
          plasmid self-ligated. The resulting plasmid was digested
          with SacI and PstI to remove the 5' MCS, which was
          replaced by a PacI linker. The resulting plasmid was
          called pPacSA.
          Next, pSAβgeo was digested with SacI to remove the SA
          and 
          βgeo sequences, but leave behind
          the bpA, and self-ligated. The resulting plasmid was
          digested with XbaI and ApaI to remove most of the 3' MCS
          (except for the terminal KpnI site), which was replaced
          with an AscI linker. The resulting plasmid was called
          pbpAAsc.
          The 
          loxP - 
          neo -tpA- 
          loxP was excised from plasmid
          PGKneotpAlox2 by cutting with NotI, Klenow filling, and
          then cutting with KpnI. This was inserted downstream of
          the SA in pPacSA digested with SalI, Klenow filled, and
          then cut with KpnI. A MCS containing the restriction
          sites for XhoI, ApaI, SacII, NotI, SacI, EcoRV, and KpnI
          was synthesized and inserted downstream of the second 
          loxP site by digesting the DNA with
          XhoI and KpnI and ligating in the MCS, which had been
          synthesized to have compatible cohesive ends. This
          plasmid was called pSAleotpA. The bpA sequence along with
          the 3' AscI site was excised from pbpAAsc by digesting it
          with SacI and KpnI, and inserted downstream of the MCS in
          pSAleotpA by digesting it with SacI and KpnI. The
          resulting plasmid was called pBigT, and its MCS contains
          sites for the restriction enzymes NheI, SalI, AccI, XhoI,
          ApaI, SacII, NotI, SacI and BclI.
          To make the 
          ROSA26 genomic sequence compatible
          with the pBigT plasmid, pROSA26-1 was digested with XbaI,
          Klenow filled and a linker (PacI, SwaI, AscI) inserted.
          This plasmid was called pROSA26PA.
          To make the R26R-YFP targeting construct, the 
          EYFP cDNA was excised from pEYFP-N1
          with ApaI and NotI and inserted into BigT digested with
          ApaI and NotI. BigT was then digested with PacI and AscI
          to release the entire floxed 
          neo -tpA and 
          EYFP assembly, and inserted into
          pROSA26PA digested with PacI and AscI. This plasmid was
          subsequently linearized with KpnI and used for
          electroporation.
          To make the R26R-CFP targeting construct pECFP was
          digested with AgeI, Klenow filled then digested with NotI
          to excise the 
          ECFP cDNA. This was inserted into
          BigT digested with XhoI, Klenow filled, and then digested
          with NotI. BigT was then digested with PacI and AscI to
          release the entire floxed neo-tpA and CFP assembly, and
          inserted into pROSA26PA digested with PacI and AscI. This
          plasmid was subsequently linearized with KpnI and used
          for electroporation.
          An appreciable amount of recombination was observed
          while trying to grow up the final targeting vector,
          resulting in an aberrant plasmid of smaller molecular
          weight. Therefore, the mixture of theses two plasmids was
          digested with KpnI which linearized both plasmids, and
          the correct targeting vector was gel purified. It was
          subsequently confirmed to be the correct targeting vector
          by diagnostic PCR, restriction digests and sequencing
          (data not shown).
        
        
          Targeting of the ROSA26locus in ES cells
          JM-1 ES cells [ 22] were expanded by culturing on
          feeder cells in medium supplemented with LIF.
          Approximately 15 × 10 6cells were electroporated with 10
          μg of each targeting vector and grown without feeders
          under selection in 300 μg/ml G418 for seven days. 96
          colonies were picked and 27 screened, for
          electroporations with each of the two constructs R26R-YFP
          and R26R-CFP. Genomic Southern blot hybridization was
          performed on DNA from ES cells digested with EcoRV. The
          5' probe used detects a 11 kb wild type band and a 3.8 kb
          targeted band, due to the presence of an extra EcoRV site
          in the targeted allele.
          Mice carrying the targeted allele were genotyped by
          the PCR as described [ 4].
        
        
          Construction of the Isl1-Cre mouse strain.
          Isl1 genomic DNA had been previously isolated from a
          mouse 129/Sv genomic library (Stratagene) as described by
          Pfaff et al. [ 25]. A PacI site had been introduced into
          an EcoRI site in the exon encoding the second LIM domain
          of Isl1. A cassette coating IRES Cre SV40 pA and
          pgk-neomycin was cloned into this PacI site to create a
          targeting construct with flanking 5' and 3' genomic DNA
          arms of 5 kb and 2 kb, respectively. ES cells were
          targeted and screened as described in Pfaff et al.[
          25].

          Cki allele) were a gift of Dr.
          Alexandra Joyner and Dr. Wolfgang Wurst [ 26].
          β-actin/Cre mice were a gift of Dr. Gail Martin [ 23].

          Detecting EYFP and ECFP expression.
          For whole mount photographs (Figures 2and 4), unfixed
          embryos were photographed using a Nikon epifluorescence
          microscope fitted with Chroma filter sets for ECFP (cyan
          GFP Ex436/20 Dm455 Bar480/40) and EYFP (yellow GFP
          Ex500/20 Dm515 Bar535/30). Digital images were acquired
          using a Spot camera.
          For histological sections (Fig 3), embryos were fixed
          overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C, washed 2x for 10
          min. in PBS, then equilibrated in the following solutions
          until the embryos settled at the bottom (approx. 30 min):
          PBS, 5% sucrose in PBS, 10% sucrose in PBS, and 15%
          sucrose in PBS. They were then equilibrated in a 1:1
          mixture of OCT (Tissue-Tek, Mile, Inc.) and 15% sucrose
          in PBS for >1 hour, and embedded in OCT over dry ice.
          Sections were cut at 8 - 12 μM, blow-dried for 30 min. at
          low heat, then stored at -80°C with desiccant in an air
          tight bag. Before being photographed, the slides were
          brought to room temperature, washed 3x in PBS, mounted in
          Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), covered with a cover
          glass and sealed with clear nail polish. Sections were
          photographed as described above.
