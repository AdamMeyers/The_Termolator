        Glucocorticoids influence a wide spectrum of cellular
        functions through their action on soluble intracellular
        receptors. In most cells, unliganded glucocorticoid
        receptors (GR) reside predominately in the cytoplasm, where
        they exist as a heteromeric complex comprised minimally of
        GR, 90-kDa and 70-kDa heat shock proteins (hsp90 and
        hsp70). Other proteins (i.e. p60/Hop, p23, hsp40, FKBP52,
        and FKBP51) have been implicated in the
        assembly/stabilization of the GR-hsp90-hsp70-complex in a
        form that has high affinity for agonist [for review, see
        Ref. 1, 2, 3]. Upon agonist binding, the complex undergoes
        a transformation, and the ligand bound GR translocates into
        to the nucleus in a manner that is determined by a nuclear
        localization sequence (NLS) contained in the receptor [ 4].
        There the GR acts as a ligand-activated transcriptional
        stimulator or repressor of primary response genes by
        binding to glucocorticoid hormone-responsive elements (GRE)
        contained in the promoter regions of steroid-responsive
        genes and either facilitating or repressing the formation
        of an active transcriptional complex.
        Although little is known about the molecular machinery
        that regulates steroid receptor movement through the
        cytoplasm and into the nucleus, several studies suggest
        that movement is influenced by reversible phosphorylation.
        Evidence for this originated from the studies of Qi et al.
        [ 5, 6], which revealed that the hormone insensitivity
        produced by cellular transformation with v-mos (a
        serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as an oncogene)
        results from both a decrease in the nuclear retention of
        liganded receptor and a decrease in the reutilization of GR
        protein that cycles back into the cytoplasm. Subsequently,
        DeFranco et al. [ 7] reported that treatment with okadaic
        acid, a potent ser/thr protein phosphatase inhibitor, also
        results in inefficient nuclear retention of agonist-bound
        GR and the cytoplasmic "trapping" of GR in a form that is
        unable to "recycle". Recent studies with okadaic acid
        suggest phosphorylation alters the high affinity binding of
        GR to hsp-90, and that an intact cytoskeleton is required
        for ligand-activated GR translocation through the cytoplasm
        to the nucleus [ 8].
        The ability of okadaic acid to influence the
        intracellular partitioning of GR suggests that an okadaic
        acid sensitive ser/thr protein phosphatase (PPase)
        participates in the regulation of GR movement. In vitro,
        okadaic acid acts as a potent inhibitor of serine/threonine
        protein phosphatases type 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) [ 9, 10].
        Accordingly, many of the effects produced by the treatment
        of cells with okadaic acid have been attributed to the
        inhibition of these two enzymes. However, due to toxicity
        and solubility constraints, in living cells it is difficult
        to distinguish the actions of PP2A from those of PP1 using
        okadaic acid. Furthermore, in humans, it is now clear that
        there are four isoforms of PP1 [PP1α, PP1δ, PP1γ 
        1 and PP1γ 
        2 [ 11, 12, 13], two isoforms of PP2A
        (PP2A α and PP2Aβ [ 14, 15]) and four structurally related
        phosphatases, PP4 [ 16], PP5 [ 17, 18], PP6 [ 19] and PP7 [
        20]. Although detailed dose-response studies have not been
        reported for native PP5, PP6 and PP7, studies with PP4 [
        21] and recombinant PP5 [ 18] indicate they are also
        sensitive to okadaic acid. Like calcineurin (PP2B) and
        PP2C, PP7 is apparently insensitive to inhibition by
        okadaic acid [ 20].
        Recent studies indicate that PP5 associates with the
        GR-hsp90 complex [ 22, 23] suggesting that PP5 may
        influence the actions of GRs. However, studying the
        cellular roles of PP5 has proven difficult, in part,
        because no physiological substrates for PP5 have been
        identified. In addition, in crude cell homogenates PP5
        resides predominately in an inactive state that represents
        <1% of the measurable PPase activity. To characterize
        the cellular roles of PP5 we have, therefore, developed
        chimeric antisense 2'- 
        O -(2-methoxy) ethylphosphothioate
        oligonucleotides capable of inhibiting the expression of
        human PP5 at nanomolar concentrations. Because the lead
        compound targeting PP5 (ISIS 15534) acts via RNAase H
        mediated degradation, studies with ISIS 15534 do not allow
        us to assess how rapid changes in PP5 activity affect
        cellular functions (Northern analysis indicate that it
        takes ~ 6 for the mRNA degradation to occur and, due to the
        half-life of the preexisting protein, it takes ~ 24 hours
        for the protein levels to fall [ 24]. Nonetheless, ISIS
        15534 potently inhibits the expression of PP5 in cultured
        cells for ~ 48-72 hours (IC 
        50 of <75 nm), which affords a ~
        24-48 hour window in which the expression of PP5 is
        essentially ablated [ 24, 25]. More importantly, because
        ISIS 15534 has no effect on the structurally related PPases
        [ 24], it can be employed to specifically inhibit the
        actions of PP5 by suppressing PP5 protein levels in
        cultured human cells.
        To assess the role of PP5 in the regulation of
        GR-mediated events, binding studies were conducted with [
        3H]dexamethasone before and after ISIS 15534-mediated
        suppression of PP5 expression. These studies revealed that
        the suppression of PP5 expression had no apparent effect on
        dexamethasone binding, suggesting that PP5 does not affect
        the formation of the high-affinity ligand binding complex
        or hormone binding to the GR [ 25]. In contrast, mobility
        gel-shift analysis revealed that treatment with ISIS 15534
        produces a marked increase in the association of GR with
        GRE-containing DNA, and transient transfection studies
        employing a GR-responsive reporter plasmid revealed that
        the suppression of PP5 expression activates GR-dependent
        transcription in the absence of hormone [ 25]. When A549
        cells were treated with ISIS 15534 and then dexamethasone,
        the effect was additive, with maximal dexamethasone induced
        luciferase activity ~ 10 times greater than the maximal
        dexamethasone-induced response attainable in the presence
        of PP5 [ 25]. Together, these studies indicate that PP5
        acts as a suppressor of GR-induced transcription.
        To further characterize the mechanism by which PP5
        affects GR function, in the present study we employed a
        GR-GFP fusion protein and fluorescent microscopy to follow
        the movement of GR in cells treated with dexamethasone and
        ISIS 15534. These studies indicate that PP5 mediated
        suppression of GR-function arises from the ability of PP5
        to suppress the nuclear accumulation of GRs.
      
      
        Results
        
          Inhibition of PP5 by okadaic acid
          Okadaic acid is widely employed to inhibit PPase
          activity in eukaryotic cells, and the observed effects
          are often attributed to the inhibition of PP1 and PP2A.
          However, as seen in Figure 1, the dephosphorylation of
          phosphohistone by the catalytic subunit of purified PP5
          from bovine brain is also potently inhibited by okadaic
          acid. Okadaic acid inhibits the activity of PP5 in a
          dose-dependent manner, having an IC 
          50 of 5.58 +/- 0.41 nM. Under
          identical assay conditions, okadaic acid is a more potent
          inhibitor of PP2A (IC 
          50 ~ 0.05 nM) and weaker inhibitor of
          PP1 (IC 
          50 ~ 45 nM). However, the activity of
          PP5 against histone (865 +/- 31 nMoles Pi/min/mg protein)
          is less than that of PP2A. Therefore, whereas assays
          conducted with PP1 and PP2A were conducted with a
          concentration of enzyme that is diluted below the
          titration endpoint (defined as the concentration of
          enzyme after which further dilution no longer affects the
          IC 
          50 ; [ 26]) because the activity of
          PP5 upon further dilution was below that necessary for
          accurate quantification, we could not establish a clear
          titration endpoint with PP5. Based on titration studies
          with microcystin-LR to estimate the actual amount of PP5
          in the reaction, an estimate of the K 
          i for okadaic acid is 4.07 +/- 0.16
          nM. Still, it should be kept in mind that the true K 
          i may be slightly lower. Nonetheless,
          it is clear that PP5 is sensitive to inhibition by
          okadaic acid at the concentrations that also affects the
          activity of PP1 and PP2A. Therefore, when okadaic acid is
          employed to treat cells at a concentration of >1-5 nM,
          the activity of PP5 is also affected.
        
        
          ISIS 15534 promotes nuclear localization of
          GR
          To determine whether the suppression of PP5 activity
          influenced the subcellular distribution of GR, plasmids
          expressing a GR-GFP fusion protein were microinjected
          into cells that were previously treated with ISIS 15534.
          In these studies the GR-GFP used was derived from the
          fusion of GFP to a GR mutant that retained the ability to
          bind agonist, translocate to the nucleus, and bind DNA,
          but lacked transactivation activity [ 27]. When plasmids
          expressing the GR-GFP were injected into the nuclei of
          cells and the cells were grown in serum-containing
          medium, the majority of the expressed GR-GFP localized to
          the nuclei of the injected cells, as expected due to the
          presence of glucocorticoids in the serum. Thus, after
          microinjection, the cells were grown in medium
          supplemented with serum for 4 to 6 hours and then serum
          starved overnight to cause the redistribution of GR-GFP.
          In the absence of serum, GR-GFP localized throughout the
          cells, with equal intensity in both the nucleus and
          cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). Upon treatment of these cells with
          dexamethasone (500 nM for 30 minutes) the GR-GFP
          efficiently translocated to the nucleus. To assess the
          role of PP5 in the intracellular partitioning of GR,
          cells were treated with ISIS 15534 or a mismatched
          control (ISIS 15521) at a concentration of 500 nM, which
          essentially ablates PP5 expression in A549 cells after 24
          hours [ 24, 25]. Approximately 24 hours after antisense
          treatment, the cells were microinjected with pGR(Ala)-GFP
          and subjected to serum-starvation as described above. In
          cells treated with the mismatch control prior to
          microinjection, GR-GFP expression was indistinguishable
          from that in untreated cells: GR-GFP was distributed
          evenly throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 2A).
          In contrast, following treatment with ISIS 15534, GR-GFP
          was localized in the nucleus without dexamethasone
          treatment. The percentage of cells displaying
          predominantly nuclear GR-GFP or cytoplasmic GR-GFP from 4
          independent experiments were tabulated and are presented
          in Figure 2B. In control cells in the absence of
          dexamethasone, 10% of the cells showed
          nuclear>cytoplasmic localization of GR-GFP. Similarly,
          20% of the cells treated with mismatch oligonucleotide
          displayed greater nuclear than cytoplasmic localization
          of GR-GFP. By contrast, the percentage of cells showing
          more nuclear than cytoplasmic distribution of GR-GFP was
          ~ 93%, ~ 88% and ~ 98% in cells treated with either
          dexamethasone, ISIS 15534, or ISIS 15534 and
          dexamethasone, respectively. These results suggest that
          PP5 plays a role in the nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning
          of GR.
        
        
          Inhibition of PP5 expression does not globally
          affect nuclear shuttling
          The ability of ISIS 15534 treatment to induce the
          nuclear accumulation of GR-GFP suggests that PP5
          influences the subcellular distribution of GR.
          Alternatively, PP5 could have a more global role,
          possibly regulating entire nuclear transport pathways. To
          test the latter, the effect of PP5 suppression on the
          nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of another transcription
          factor, NFAT, was investigated. In these studies, a
          stable GFP-NFAT expressing HeLa cell line was employed [
          38]. As seen in Figure 3, in the absence of any drug, the
          GFP-NFAT protein is localized entirely within the
          cytoplasm. Upon treatment with the calcium ionophore
          ionomycin, GFP-NFAT translocates rapidly to the nucleus.
          The fusion protein then relocates to the cytoplasm if the
          drug is washed out of the cells for 6 hours. When the
          GFP-NFAT HeLa cells were treated with ISIS 15534, the
          distribution of GFP-NFAT was indistinguishable from
          untreated cells or cells treated with mismatched control
          oligonucleotides. Northern analysis confirmed the ability
          of ISIS 15534 to suppress PP5 expression in Hela cells.
          Therefore, the results indicate that suppression of PP5
          expression does not have a global effect on all nuclear
          shuttling proteins.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Like other steroid hormone receptors, GRs are
        phosphoproteins, and reversible phosphorylation of specific
        ser/thr residues on the GR or associated proteins has been
        implicated in the regulation of 1) hormone binding to the
        cytoplasmic GR-complex, 2) the translocation of the GR
        between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, 3) the binding of
        ligand activated GR to consensus GRE in the promoter
        regions of GR-responsive genes, and 4) the formation of an
        active transcriptional complex [ 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 28, 29,
        30, 31]. Many of the kinases that catalyze the
        phosphorylation of GRs and associated proteins have been
        identified. However, little is known about the PPases that
        must also participate in the regulation of GR-mediated
        signaling networks.
        Several recent studies indicate that PP5 participates in
        the regulation of GR-induced gene expression. First,
        dexamethasone-induced transcription is markedly enhanced
        when the expression of PP5 is suppressed by treatment with
        ISIS 15534 [ 25]. Second, both co-immunoprecipitation
        studies and studies with mutant forms of PP5 indicate that
        PP5 associates with the GR-hsp90 complex [ 22, 23].
        However, binding assays revealed that the suppression of
        PP5 expression has no apparent effect on [ 3H]dexamethasone
        binding [ 25]. Therefore, PP5 appears to act as a
        suppressor of GR-induced gene expression via a mechanism
        that does not alter receptor number or the binding of
        hormone to the GR. To further characterize the relationship
        between PP5 and GR, in the present study we employed a
        GR-GFP fusion protein to track the movement of GRs in A549
        cells following treatment with hormones or ISIS 15534.
        These studies revealed that in the absence of
        glucocorticoids, GR-GFP localized mainly in the cytoplasm.
        As expected, treatment with dexamethasone results in the
        efficient translocation of GR-GFPs into the nucleus.
        Nuclear accumulation of GR-GFP was also observed when the
        expression of PP5 was suppressed by treatment with ISIS
        15534 after ~ 24 hours. This translocation of GR-GFP
        occurred without the addition of glucocorticoids and in the
        presence of serum free media. Thus, in the absence of
        physiological concentrations of PP5, GRs accumulate in the
        nucleus of A549 cells. This finding is consistent with data
        obtained from gel-shift analysis and transfection studies
        conducted with GR-reporter plasmids, where a decrease in
        PP5 levels facilitates the association of GR with DNA and
        produces an increase in GR-transactivation [ 25]. Together,
        these studies suggest that the increase in GR-induced
        transcriptional activity observed when the expression of
        PP5 is suppressed by treatment with ISIS 15534 results from
        the nuclear accumulation of GR.
        The mechanism by which PP5 suppresses the nuclear
        accumulation of GR is not clear. The current data is
        consistent with PP5 acting to suppress the nuclear import
        of GRs. Alternatively, the data is also consistent with PP5
        acting to promote the nuclear export of the GRs. Because
        the effects of ISIS 15534 treatment are not readily
        reversible, the washout experiments needed to distinguish
        between these two possibilities cannot be conducted until a
        specific and reversible inhibitor of PP5 is developed.
        Recent studies indicate that okadaic acid inhibits
        nuclear transport mediated by import receptors, importin β
        and transportin, suggesting that an okadaic acid sensitive
        phosphatase participates in a mechanism that negatively
        regulates entire nuclear transport pathways [ 32]. Since
        PP5 is sensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid, we tested
        the possibility that PP5 acted at a more global level by
        assessing the effect of ISIS 15534 on the cellular
        distribution of NFAT-GFP. In contrast to the findings
        obtained with GR-GFP, the suppression of PP5 expression had
        no apparent effect on calcium induced nuclear import or the
        subsequent export of NFAT-GFP (Figure 3). Therefore, PP5
        does not appear to regulate entire nuclear transport
        pathways.
      
      
        Conclusions
        These studies indicate that PP5 participates in the
        regulation of GR nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and that the
        suppression of PP5 expression results in the nuclear
        accumulation of GR in the absence of hormone. Therefore,
        the previously reported increase in GR-induced
        transcriptional activity that occurs after ISIS 15534
        induced suppression of PP5 expression likely results from
        the nuclear accumulation of GR in a form that is capable of
        binding DNA yet still requires agonist to elicit maximal
        transcriptional activation. Still, it is not yet clear if
        PP5 acts to suppress the nuclear accumulation or to
        facilitate the nuclear export of GRs. Thus, the precise
        molecular mechanism by which PP5 suppresses the nuclear
        accumulation of GR remains to be elucidated.

          Cell Culture
          A549 lung carcinoma cells were obtained from the
          American Type Tissue Collection. A stable HeLa cell line
          expressing GFP-NFAT was generously provided by Larry
          Gerace (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA).
          HeLa and A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified
          Eagle's medium containing 1 g of glucose/liter (DMEM) and
          10 % heat-inactivated FBS. All cell cultures were
          routinely passed when 90-95% confluent.
        
        
          Oligonucleotide Synthesis Assay for Oligonucleotide
          Inhibition of PP5 Expression
          2'- 
          O -(2-methoxy)ethylphosphothioate
          oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified as
          previously described [ 33]. To suppress the expression of
          PP5, the indicated cells were plated in 60 mm dished and
          cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS. When the cells were
          about 70% confluent, they were treated with
          oligonucleotides as previously described [ 24, 25].
          Briefly, cells were washed with DMEM. A solution (1 ml)

          concentration and 15 μg/ml DOTMA/DOPE (Lipofectin ®;
          GIBCO-BRL) was then added. After incubating the cells at
          37°C for 4 hours, the cells were washed and cultured in
          fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS for 17 hours. The cells
          were then harvested, and total RNA was extracted with

          to DURLON-UV (Stratagene) nylon membranes. Following UV
          cross-linking, the filters were hybridized with a [
          32P]probe for human PP5. The human PP5 cDNA probe was
          generated from the full length coding region of PP5 and [
          32P]labeled with DECAprime ®DNA Labeling Kit (Ambion)
          according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hybridization
          was performed in the presence of 50% formamide at 42°C
          for 16 hours. Following hybridization, the membrane was
          subjected to two low stringency washes (2 × SSC) at room
          temperature and then two high stringency washes (0.1 ×
          SSC/0.5% SDS) at 55°C. Hybridization was visualized by
          autoradiography, and the filters were then stripped and
          reprobed with a [ 32P]labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
          dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probe to confirm equal
          loading. Quantification of hybridization signals was
          achieved by analysis of the scanned autoradiograms using
          the NIH Image program (ImagePC).
        
        
          Preparation of phosphoprotein substrates
          Histone (type 2AS from Sigma) was phosphorylated with
          cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) as
          described previously [ 34]. Briefly, 20 mg of histone was
          incubated with 1 mg of protein kinase A, in a 20 mM
          Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mCi [ 32P]ATP (150
          μM ATP), 100 μM cAMP, 5 mM DTT, and 5 mM MgCl 
          2 in a final volume of 4 ml. The
          reaction was allowed to continue for 3.5 to 4 hrs at 30°C
          and terminated by the addition of 1.3 ml of 100% TCA. The
          precipitated phosphohistone was collected by
          centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was
          discarded, and the pellet was redissolved in 4 ml of 1 M
          Tris-Cl (pH 8.2). TCA was added to precipitate the
          phosphohistone, and this precipitation-resuspension wash
          was repeated 5 times. The pellet produced upon the sixth
          TCA precipitation was washed 2 times with 4 ml of
          ethanol:ethyl ether (1:4; v:v) and then 2 additional
          times with acidified ethanol:ethyl ether (1:4; 0.1 N
          HCl). The washed histone was allowed to air dry and was
          then resuspended in 5 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4). This procedure
          yields phosphohistone with a specific activity > 4.5 ×
          10 6CPM/nMole incorporated phosphate.
        
        
          Determination of phosphatase activity
          Phosphatase activity against phosphohistone was
          determined by the quantification of [ 32P] liberation
          from phosphohistone as described previously [ 34].
          Assays, 80 μl total volume, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
          7.4, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 100 μM oleic acid (assay
          buffer) and [ 32P]phosphoprotein (1-2 μM PO 
          4 ), were conducted at 37°C as
          described previously [ 34] using PP5 purified from bovine
          brain. The serine/threonine protein phosphatase type 5
          (PP5) was purified from bovine brain according to the
          following procedure: a bovine brain was homogenized in ~
          3 volumes of buffer A (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 4°C, 1 mM EDTA,
          10 mM PMSF and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and subjected to
          centrifugation at 15,000 g for 40 min. followed by a
          45%-60% ammonium sulfate fractionation of the
          supernatant. The pellets from the ammonium sulfate
          fractionation were resuspended in 60 ml of buffer B (20
          mM HEPES pH 8.5 4°C, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1%
          2-mercaptoethanol), desalted on a G-25 sephadex column
          equilibrated with buffer B, then subjected to sequential
          chromatography on a 5 ml HiTrap Heparin column
          (Pharmacia), a 5 ml HiTrap Q column (Pharmacia) and a
          HiTrap SP column (Pharmacia) respectively. The eluate
          from the SP column was then diluted 5-fold with buffer C
          (20 mM tris pH 8.5, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol)
          and subjected to anion-exchange chromatography on a
          BioScale Q column (2 ml from BioRad). All steps in the
          purification procedure were performed at 4°C except for
          the last step which was performed at 23°C. PP5 activity
          was followed during the purification by assaying for
          trypsin-stimulated phosphohydrolase activity at 37°C vs.
          p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 200 μl reactions containing:
          25 mM tris pH 8.3, 25 mM MgCl 
          2 , 1 mM DTT and 10 mM p-nitrophenyl
          phosphate.
          Dephosphorylation reactions were routinely conducted
          for 10 minutes and initiated with the addition of
          substrate. The dephosphorylation of substrate was kept to
          less than 10 % of the total phosphorylated substrate, and
          the reaction was linear with respect to enzyme
          concentration and time. [ 32P]phosphate liberated by the
          enzymes was extracted as a phosphomolybdate complex and
          measured according to the methods of Killilea et al. [
          35]. Inhibition of phosphatase activity by okadaic acid
          was determined by adding the inhibitors to the enzyme
          mixture 10 minutes prior to initiating the reaction with
          the addition of substrate.
        
        
          GR-GFP expression vectors
          A mutant rat glucocorticoid receptor that retained
          hormone binding, nuclear translocation activity, and
          specific DNA binding activity, but was incapable of
          transactivation was fused to a S65T mutant of green
          fluorescent protein to create pGR(Ala)-GFP. GR(Ala)-GFP
          expression is driven by the CMV immediate early promoter
          and enhancer. All manipulations were performed as
          described, and all constructs were confirmed by
          sequencing [ 36]. Protein-free plasmid DNA was purified
          using Qiagen maxiprep columns (San Diego, CA) and
          contained predominantly supercoiled plasmid with no
          contaminating RNA or low molecular weight
          contaminants.
        
        
          GFP-GR translocation
          Cells were plated on etched coverslips and grown until
          the cultures were ~ 70 % confluent. The cells were then
          either treated with oligonucleotides as described above
          or left untreated. Eighteen hours later, purified
          protein-free pGR(Ala)-GFP suspended in phosphate-buffered
          saline (0.25 mg/ml) was microinjected into the nuclei of
          the cells [ 37]. Typically, 150-200 cells were injected
          for each condition. After microinjection the cells were
          incubated in medium containing 10% FBS for 6 hours at
          37°C. The cells were then washed several times with
          serum-free media and placed in serum deficient media for
          14 hours to prevent GFP-GR translocation to the nucleus,
          prior to treatment with 500 nM dexamethasone (30 min.) or
          with vehicle alone. The cells were washed 3 times with
          PBS, fixed by incubation in PBS supplemented with 4 %
          paraformaldehyde for 10 min and washed again 3 times with
          PBS before mounting on slides with DABCO/DAPI mounting
          solution. GR-GFP expression and localization were
          monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclei were
          localized by DAPI staining. Images were captured with an
          Optronics cooled CCD camera and imported into Adobe
          Photoshop. The experiments were repeated 4 times (6 for
          control). One-way ANOVA was performed to determine
          statistical significance of the results using Instat 2.03
          (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).
        
        
          GFP-NFAT nuclear shuttling assay
          Stably-transfected HeLa cells expressing GFP-NFAT [
          38] were grown on glass coverslips to approximately 30%
          confluency and either left untreated or treated with,
          ISIS 15534, or ISIS 15521 (a mismatched oligonucleotide
          control for ISIS 15534) in the absence of serum as
          described above. Four hours later, FBS was added to 10%
          and the cells were grown for an additional 24 hours. The
          cells were then treated with 1 μM ionomycin for 30
          minutes, after which time they were either fixed
          immediately or washed extensively with PBS and incubated
          for 6 hours in medium lacking the drug ("washout").
          Control cells were not incubated with ionomycin. GFP-NFAT
          localization was monitored by fluorescence microscopy,
          and images were captured with an Optronics cooled CCD
          camera and imported into Adobe Photoshop.
