        Most animal cells are constantly rearranging their
        cellular structures to optimally perform their functions or
        to respond appropriately to the changing environment that
        surrounds them. Using a simple protein "building block"
        that has the ability to self-associate to form massive
        structural arrays is a common theme used in creating a
        dynamic cytoskeleton. Temporal and spatial regulation of
        this self-assembly and its associated disassembly process
        is critical for correct function. For a model system, we
        have focused on the dynamics of myosin II thick filaments
        in 
        D. discoideum . This protein forms a
        self-assembled, highly regulated bi-directional array of
        molecules that together with actin filaments are capable of
        producing force for cellular rearrangements. All evidence
        suggests that unless this molecule is assembled into its
        appropriate thick filament array it cannot function to
        produce force.
        Eukaryotic cells during cell division construct
        contractile rings that are mainly composed of an
        actin-based cytoskeleton. Myosin II, a key component of
        this actin-based cytoskeleton, has been shown to be
        essential for cytokinesis of 
        D. discoideum cells in suspension as
        well as for efficient chemotaxis and morphogenetic changes
        in shape during development) [ 1 2 3 ] . All of these roles
        require myosin II to be in the form of thick filaments. The
        question of how myosin II thick filament assembly is
        regulated within living cells, however, remains mostly
        unanswered. The amoeba 
        D. discoideum has a number of
        advantages as a model system to study in vivo regulation of
        myosin II thick filament assembly. 
        D. discoideum has only one endogenous
        copy of the myosin II heavy chain gene, and null strains of
        myosin II are available) [ 1 2 ] ). Cytokinesis in 
        D. discoideum is also morphologically
        very similar to that of animal cells) [ 4 ] .
        In 
        D. discoideum , myosin II molecules
        are constantly relocating into multiple locations for
        participating in various processes. Dynamic exchange occurs
        between a cytosolic soluble pool and assembled filaments
        that are enriched in the cortical cytoskeleton. The
        half-life of myosin between these pools has been measured
        to be ~ 7 sec, indicating the importance of dynamic
        assembly control in the localization of the protein) [ 5 ]
        . When a cell migrates, myosin II accumulates in the
        posterior of the cell. During cell division, myosin II
        accumulates in the cleavage furrow in the early stages of
        cytokinesis. To accomplish its cellular tasks, myosin II
        assembles into bipolar thick filaments and pull together
        oppositely oriented actin filaments to produce contractile
        forces. Mutant forms of myosin II that do not assemble into
        bipolar thick filaments in vitro fail to rescue myosin null
        phenotypes, nor do they localize to the furrow during
        cytokinesis [ 6 7 ] ). Although myosin II is not essential
        for cell division on a surface, it is critical for normal
        timely cell separation and for symmetric placement of the
        division furrow [ 8 ] . GFP-myosin II is transported to the
        furrow of dividing cells growing on surfaces even though it
        is not essential for cytokinesis under these
        conditions.
        The assembly of myosin II monomers into filaments is
        regulated by phosphorylation of its heavy chains at three
        threonine residues at the C-terminus of the tail [ 9 10 ] .
        Dephosphorylation of these threonines is a prerequisite of
        filament assembly, as confirmed by the phenotypes of a
        3xAsp mutant, in which the three threonines are replaced by
        three aspartate residues (mimicking the phosphorylated
        state) [ 11 ] . In vitro the 3xAsp myosin II is severely
        impaired for filament assembly, and in vivo 3xAsp myosin II
        fails to assemble or localize to the cortical cytoskeleton.
        Cells expressing this myosin thus recapitulate the defects
        of myosin II null cells, including failure to develop
        normally and failure to divide in suspension. In contrast,
        cells expressing a non-phosphorylatable myosin II construct
        (3xAla myosin cells) display severe myosin overassembly
        into the cytoskeleton [ 11 ] , and excessive myosin
        localization to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis [ 7
        ] . The 3xAla myosin cells also display severe defects in
        chemotactic cell migration, demonstrating the importance of
        proper myosin II assembly dynamics in this process [ 12 ]
        .
        Myosin II heavy chain kinase (MHCK) activity in this
        system capable of disassembling myosin II filaments in
        vitro was originally reported with partially enriched
        kinase fractions [ 13 ] . The enzyme MHCK-A was
        subsequently purified to homogeneity and shown to be
        capable of driving myosin II filament disassembly in vitro
        via myosin II heavy chain phosphorylation [ 14 15 ] ). A
        MHCK-A cDNA was cloned via expression cloning and peptide
        sequence derived from the native enzyme [ 16 ] . This
        enzyme is now recognized as the founding member of a highly
        novel family of protein kinases unrelated to conventional
        protein kinases, with members present in 
        D. discoideum and throughout the
        animal kingdom. Homology-based cloning and genomic
        approaches led to the identification of two closely related
        
        D. discoideum enzymes, MHCK-B [ 17 ]
        and MHCK-C (GenBank accession AAC31918, and [ 18 ] ).
        Several enzymes present in mammalian systems are now
        recognized as having the same conserved catalytic domain,
        including the eEF-2 kinases [ 19 ] [ 20 ] and TRP-PLIK, a
        bifunctional protein with kinase and ion channel activities
        [ 21 ] . Biochemical analysis with MHCK-B has confirmed
        that this enzyme phosphorylates 
        D. discoideum myosin II in vitro [ 17
        22 ] ). Analysis reported here confirms that MHCK-C also
        readily phosphorylates 
        D. discoideum myosin II in vitro,
        supporting a possible direct role for this enzyme in myosin
        II localization control in vivo.
        Although substantial biochemical analysis has been
        performed with this family of 
        D. discoideum MHCKs, there is
        relatively little information on the cellular distribution
        of the endogenous MHCKs in vivo. Previously, Steimle and
        colleagues [ 23 ] reported that in interphase cells, during
        chemotaxis, random migration, and endocytic/phagocytic
        events, MHCK-A is recruited preferentially to anterior
        F-actin rich protrusions. With the discovery of two
        additional myosin II heavy chain kinases, MHCK-B and
        MHCK-C, we report here in live migrating and cytokinetic
        cells a systematic in vivo examination of these three MHCKs
        labeled with GFP.
        This analysis reveals striking differences in
        localization between these three enzymes. During
        cytokinesis, MHCK-A displays weak enrichment at the cell
        poles, while MHCK-B displays a mostly diffuse localization.
        In contrast, MHCK-C displays strong localization to the
        cleavage furrow only during the late stages of cell
        division. These results suggest that 
        D. discoideum cells use a family of
        related MHCKs to modulate myosin II filament assembly, each
        with distinct roles.
      
      
        Results
        
          MHCK domain organization and MHCK C biochemical
          activity
          The enzymes MHCK-A and MHCK-B have established roles
          in the control of 
          D. discoideum myosin filament
          assembly both in vitro and in vivo [ 16 17 24 ] , and
          Egelhoff, T. T., (unpublished studies). These enzymes
          have a conserved domain organization that includes a
          highly novel protein kinase catalytic domain unrelated to
          conventional kinases, and a carboxyl-terminal WD repeat
          domain that targets these enzymes to myosin II filaments
          (Figure 1). Genomic sequence corresponding to the related
          enzyme MHCK-C was deposited in GenBank by Loomis and
          colleagues (accession number AAC31918). MHCK-C differs
          from MHCK-A and MHCK-B in that it lacks any significant
          amino-terminal domain upstream of the catalytic domain;
          conserved catalytic domain residues are present within
          approximately 30 residues of the methionine start codon
          of MHCK-C (Figure 1). Of this set of enzymes, MHCK-C is
          also unique in that it contains a large central domain of
          approximately 30 kDa that consists of highly repetitive
          stretches rich in serine, asparagine, proline, and
          glutamine. However, the strong similarity of MHCK-C to
          MHCK-A and MHCK-B in the conserved catalytic domain and
          the carboxyl-terminal WD repeat domain suggested that it
          might represent a third myosin heavy chain kinase in this
          organism.
          To test this possibility at the biochemical level, we
          engineered and expressed an epitope-tagged construct that
          contains an amino-terminal FLAG epitope fused to codon 2
          of MHCK-C. FLAG-MHCK-C was purified using a combination
          of ammonium sulfate fractionation and FLAG-peptide
          affinity chromatography. Purified FLAG-MHCK-C was
          subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis with
          anti-MHCK-C polyclonal antibodies (Figure 2A) and with
          anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (not shown), and
          Coomassie staining (Figure 2A) confirmed the purification
          of the expressed protein, migrating at the correct size
          for MHCK-C. The FLAG-MHCK-C protein consistently suffered
          proteolytic cleavage during purification. In initial
          lysates, the major immunoreactive species migrated at ~
          100 kDa, but during purification a major clipped species
          formed with a size of ~ 35 kDa (Figure 2A). This species
          reacted with both anti-MHCK-C antisera and with anti-FLAG
          epitope antibodies (not shown), indicating this fragment
          to be an amino-terminal domain of MHCK-C. Addition of
          protease inhibitors during purification reduced but did
          not eliminate formation of this clipped MHCK-C.
          Purified FLAG-MHCK-C readily phosphorylated native 
          D. discoideum myosin II on the
          myosin heavy chain (MHC) in vitro (Figure 2Band 2C). No
          incorporation was detected on autoradiographs at the
          mobility of myosin light chains, supporting the model
          that MHCK-C, like MHCK-A, modulates filament assembly and
          not myosin motor activity (data not shown). To determine
          whether phosphorylation by MHCK-C affected myosin II
          assembly properties, samples of purified 
          D. discoideum myosin II were
          incubated with MHCK-C in the presence and absence of ATP.
          Samples were then subjected to centrifugation to sediment
          myosin II filaments, and the proportion of myosin II in
          the pellet in each sample was quantified using SDS-PAGE
          and Coomassie blue staining as a measure of filament
          assembly (Figure 3A). Incubation of myosin II with MHCK-C
          in the absence of ATP resulted in assembly levels typical
          for purified 
          Dictyostelium myosin, with 82% of
          the myosin sedimenting in the current set of assays
          (Figure 3B). Incubation of myosin II with MHCK-C in the
          presence of ATP resulted in substantial filament
          disassembly, with only 32% of the myosin II sedimenting
          following phosphorylation. These results confirm that
          MHCK-C can phosphorylate myosin II, and that this
          phosphorylation is capable of driving filament
          disassembly in vitro.
          Myosin II phosphorylation experiments revealed two
          additional features of MHCK-C biochemical behavior.
          First, FLAG-MHCK-C autophosphorylates during the course
          of in vitro phosphorylation reactions (Figure 2B).
          Second, the activity of FLAG-MHCK-C appears to be very
          low in the initial stages of in vitro phosphorylation
          reactions, but then rises after approximately 5 minutes
          (Figure 2C). These attributes are reminiscent of the
          behavior of MHCK-A, which upon purification exists in an
          unphosphorylated low activity state. In vitro
          autophosphorylation of MHCK-A was found to increase the V
          
          max of the enzyme 50-fold [ 25 ] . To
          test for similar autophosphorylation regulation of
          MHCK-C, we tested the activity of FLAG-MHCK-C with and
          without an initial autophosphorylation step, towards the
          peptide substrate MH-1 (a 16-residue peptide
          corresponding to one of the mapped MHC phosphorylation
          target sites for MHCK A in the myosin tail). If
          FLAG-MHCK-C was not subjected to a
          pre-autophosphorylation step, 32P incorporation into the
          peptide displayed a similar lag phase as observed for
          myosin II phosphorylation (Figure 4Aand 4B, open
          symbols). If FLAG-MHCK-C was pretreated with Mg-ATP for
          10 min at room temperature, the lag phase for peptide
          phosphorylation was eliminated (figure 4Aand 4B, closed
          symbols). These results support the model that
          autophosphorylation activates MHCK-C. Another feature
          reported earlier for MHCK-A activation is that myosin II
          itself stimulates autophosphorylation [ 25 ] . To test
          whether MHCK-C autophosphorylation is accelerated in the
          presence of myosin II, the stoichiometry of FLAG-MHCK-C
          autophosphorylation was evaluated in the presence and
          absence of myosin II filaments. Under the assay
          conditions here, myosin II did not significantly
          stimulate the rate of FLAG-MHCK-C autophosphorylation
          (Figure 4C). This result suggests that MHCK-C may be
          regulated in vivo by mechanisms distinct from those that
          regulate the activity of MHCK-A.
        
        
          MHCKs have different subcellular localizations in
          interphase cells
          To gain insights into the relative cellular roles and
          localization of MHCK-A, MHCK-B, and MHCK-C, we have
          evaluated the behavior of GFP fusions corresponding to
          each of these enzymes. Distribution of GFP-labelled MHCKs
          (GFP-MHCK-A, -B and -C) was examined in live AX2 cells
          (containing an endogenous mhcA gene). These GFP-MHCK
          expressing cells were able to sporulate and grow in
          suspension, indicating that at the expression level of
          these clonal cell lines, the expression of GFP-MHCKs in
          the AX2 cells does not detectably change myosin II
          expression or function. The fluorescence distributions of
          these cells were compared with cells expressing
          GFP-myosin II, obtained by transforming myosin null cells
          with a plasmid that carries GFP-mhcA-containing plasmid
          p102 (Materials and Methods) designated as GFP-myosin II
          cells hereafter.
          The localization pattern of the GFP-MHCKs in the
          presence of myosin II was first compared to the
          distribution of GFP-myosin II cells in interphase (Fig.
          5). Many cells of each transformation were examined (n
          > 50) and examples of the distribution of GFP-MHCK-A
          (Fig. 5-A, top), GFP-MHCK-B (Fig. 5-B, top) and
          GFP-MHCK-C (Fig. 5-C, top) are shown. GFP-myosin II
          distributed in the cytoplasm and enriched in a cortical
          layer in interphase as has been described earlier [ 7 ]
          is shown in Fig. 5-M(top). GFP-labelled MHCK-A and B
          distributed in the cytoplasm, and appeared to be excluded
          from the area that corresponded to nucleus. In contrast
          to GFP-Myosin II, GFP-labelled MHCK-A and B did not
          concentrate in the cell cortex (Fig. 5-M, top). Pixel
          intensities on a line drawn through the center of the
          cells allow a more quantitative comparison of the
          enrichment of GFP-MHCKs. A cortical distribution shows a
          distinctively increased accumulation of GFP fluorescent
          intensity at the cell edges, displaying two peaks
          flanking the cell cross-section as seen in the case of
          the GFP-myosin II cells (Fig. 5-M, middle). Out of the
          three MHCKs, only GFP-MHCK-C appeared to be concentrated
          in the cell cortex (Fig. 5-C, top), and had the
          fluorescent profiles containing the two flanking peaks
          (Figure 5-C, middle). GFP-MHCK-C also appears to be
          excluded from the nucleus, similar to that seen in cells
          expressing GFP-myosin II.
          In free-moving cells, GFP-MHCK-A was frequently
          transiently enriched in the protruding edge (Fig. 5-A,
          bottom), and hence results in rather noticeable
          pseudopods at the anterior region compared with that in
          the GFP-myosin II cells. A time-lapse movie in Quicktime
          format illustrating this behavior is available as an
          additional file (see additional file 1). GFP-MHCK-B,
          however, displayed no indication of transient enrichment
          in any part of the cells while moving; instead it
          distributes homogeneously within cells (Fig. 5-B,
          bottom). The cells expressing GFP-MHCK-B appeared to have
          smooth cell edges because the fluorescence did not label
          the dynamic pseudopods at the leading edge of the cell,
          compared with that in GFP-MHCK-A cells. In contrast to
          MHCK-A and MHCK-B distribution, GFP-MHCK-C was frequently
          enriched in the posterior cortex of the moving cells
          (Fig. 5-C, bottom), as seen also for GFP-myosin II (Fig.
          5-D, bottom). GFP-MHCK-C occasionally displayed transient
          enrichment in pseudopodial extensions as well (data not
          shown).
        
        
          Dynamic localization of GFP-myosin II and
          GFP-MHCK-C in the cortex of living D.
          discoideumcells
          As shown above, in interphase GFP-myosin II and
          GFP-MHCK-C expressed in the presence of myosin II both
          concentrate in the cell cortex. The actin-rich cortex is
          estimated to be approximately 0.1-0.2 μm thick in 
          D. discoideum cells [ 26 ] ,
          similar to the thickness in other eukaryotic cells [ 27 ]
          . This dimension makes total internal reflection
          fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy an attractive tool to
          examine cortical GFP-labelled proteins at the
          cell-surface contacts. Total internal reflection occurs
          when light travelling in a medium with high refractive
          index encounters a medium with low refractive index
          beyond the critical angle, determined by the ratio of the
          two refractive indices according to the Snell's law [ 28
          ] . In our experiments, the coverslip and the cells
          represent the media with high and low refractive indices,
          respectively. Under this condition, there is still an
          exponentially-decayed, evanescent wave penetrating into
          the 
          D. discoideum cells. The typical
          depth of the evanescent wave is in the range of 100-200
          nm away from the coverslip, which is suitable for
          exciting cortical GFP-proteins in living 
          D. discoideum cells.
          As examined by in vitro electron microscopy,
          negatively stained purified wild-type myosin II molecules
          formed bipolar thick filaments 0.6-0.8 μm in length [ 29
          ] . Filament structures of similar size have also been
          observed via immunofluorescent microscopic observation of
          fixed cells [ 30 ] . Examination of live, GFP-myosin II
          expressing cells with a TIRF microscope (Fig. 6A) shows
          an accumulation of fluorescent rod-like shapes with an
          estimated length to be approximately 0.64 μm (standard
          deviation = 0.10, n = 146). This dimension is consistent
          with myosin II thick filaments measured from the in vitro
          electron microscopy photographs [ 29 ] . Using TIRF
          microscopy, these structures, putative filaments, are not
          apparent in GFP-3xAsp myosin II cells in which the three
          potential Thr phosphorylation targets have been replaced
          with Asp residues (data not shown). As this MHC mutation
          inhibits filament assembly [ 11 ] , the inability of
          GFP-3xASP myosin to form such structures suggests that
          these TIRF-resolved structures are discrete myosin II
          filaments. Our TIRF analysis furthermore indicated that a
          few of the GFP-myosin II thick filaments move
          dynamically. Some filaments moved a long distance across
          the field with a velocity up to approximately 0.4 μm/sec
          before stopping. Other filaments seemed to be confined to
          a small region and eventually disappeared.
          GFP-MHCK-C expressing cells (in the presence of myosin
          II), display punctate aggregates of fluorescence, with
          the longer dimension approximately 0.30 μm (standard
          deviation = 0.05, n = 165, Fig. 6B). The shorter
          dimension is about 0.15-0.2 μm, similar to what was
          observed in myosin II thick filaments. The GFP-MHCK-C
          fluorescent aggregates showed dynamic motility similar to
          that of GFP-myosin II aggregates. These structures could
          not be detected when GFP-MHCK-C was expressed in myosin
          II null cells (data not shown), suggesting that the
          formation of the GFP-MHCK-C punctate aggregates is myosin
          II-dependent.
        
        
          Differential localization of GFP-MHCKs during
          cytokinesis
          At the early stage of cytokinesis, GFP-myosin II
          reorganizes and is concentrated into the region that
          flanks the furrow located at the equatorial region of the
          dividing cells (Fig. 7-M, top). As the two daughter cells
          continue to separate (denoted the late stage of
          cytokinesis), GFP-myosin II persists in this zone, which
          becomes the posterior region of each of the two forming
          daughter cells (Fig. 7-M, bottom). GFP-myosin II, on the
          other hand, was not enriched in the polar region and
          therefore the polar regions displayed a smooth contour in
          fluorescent images, as described earlier [ 7 ] .
          Neither GFP-MHCK-A (Fig. 7-A) or -B (Fig. 7-B) was
          observed to be concentrated in the furrow region during
          any stage of cytokinesis; nor did they localize to the
          posterior region of the two daughter cells at the late
          stage of cytokinesis. Instead, GFP-MHCK-A was enriched in
          the protrusions extending from the poles of the dividing
          cells, which resulted in a more prominent appearance of
          the ruffling polar pseudopods throughout the cytokinesis
          process. GFP-MHCK-B, however, stayed homogeneously
          cytoplasmic during cytokinesis without any sign of
          enrichment in any region. It was excluded from the polar
          protrusions, as seen by the smooth contour of the poles
          (Fig. 7-B). Interestingly, as the cells progressed from
          the early to late stages of cytokinesis, GFP-MHCK-B
          appeared to be excluded from the furrow (Fig 7-B), as
          compared to the appearance of GFP-MHCK-A or
          GFP-MHCK-C.
          The localization pattern of GFP-MHCK-C was different
          from the other two kinases (Fig. 7-C). At the early stage
          of cytokinesis, GFP-MHCK-C generally displayed a
          cytosolic distribution with some uniform cortical
          enrichment, but showed no sign of furrow concentration.
          However, at the late stage of cytokinesis, as soon as the
          two daughter cells begin to separate from each other,
          GFP-MHCK-C became detectable at the newly formed
          posterior regions of the two daughter cells. The spatial
          localization of GFP-MHCK-C is similar to that observed
          for GFP-myosin II at the late stage of cytokinesis (Fig.
          7-Band 7-M). In summary, these three GFP-MHCKs have
          distributions that are temporally and spatially
          different, as summarized in the sketches shown in Figure
          7bottom.
          To further illustrate the differential temporal
          localization, images of two cells expressing GFP-MHCK-C
          are compared to a cell expressing GFP-myosin II from the
          interphase (I, Figure 8) to the fully divided daughter
          cells (D, Figure 8). During interphase, all three cells
          display cortical distribution of the GFP-labeled
          proteins. When the cells progress into the quiescence
          stage (Q; equivalent to mid-mitosis), GFP-MHCK-C loses
          its cortical enrichment while GFP-myosin II typically
          remains cortical. When the cells begin to elongate (E,
          Figure 8), GFP-myosin II already concentrates at the
          equatorial region and remains there through the early
          stage (C 
          e , Figure 8), the mid-stage (C 
          m , Figure 8), and the late stage of
          cytokinesis. GFP-MHCK-C, however, displays no sign of
          furrow localization until the late stage of cytokinesis,
          when it suddenly appears at the posterior region of the
          daughter cells and stays for the duration of cell
          division (D). Time lapse movies in Quicktime format
          corresponding to each series in figure 8are available as

          Localization of GFP-MHCKs in the absence of myosin
          II
          To understand whether the differential distribution
          observed on GFP-MHCK-A, -B and -C cells depended on the
          existence of myosin II, we expressed these kinases in
          myosin II null cells and compared the localization
          patterns. GFP-MHCK-A and -B showed identical localization
          in both interphase and cytokinesis cells regardless of
          the presence of myosin II in the cells (data not shown).
          GFP-MHCK-C, however, failed to localize to the cortex in
          interphase cells (Fig. 9-C, M null, top), and the two
          characteristic peaks were missing in the linescan. During
          free movement in the absence of myosin II, GFP-MHCK-C was
          not enriched in the posterior region of the cells (Fig.
          9-C, M null, bottom). At the early stage of cytokinesis
          in myosin II null cells, GFP-MHCK-C was not enriched the
          furrow region (figure 10, top), similar to what was
          observed in the presence of myosin II as shown in Figure
          7-C, top. However, when myosin II null cells progressed
          to the late stage of cell separation, GFP-MHCK-C was
          never localized to the constricting furrow or to the
          forming posterior region of the two daughter cells (Fig.
          10-C, M null, bottom).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The results reported here provide biochemical and
        cellular evidence indicating that 
        D. discoideum contains a related
        family of MHC kinase isoforms that display distinct modes
        of regulation in vitro and distinct localization dynamics
        in vivo during contractile events, particularly during
        cytokinesis. Although MHCK-A has been extensively
        characterized at the biochemical level [ 18 22 25 31 ] ,
        only limited biochemical analysis has been performed with
        bacterially-expressed subdomains of MHCK-B and MHCK-C [ 17
        18 22 ] . The current biochemical results provide strong
        support for the hypothesis that MHCK-C acts as a MHC kinase
        in vivo. Further studies with second messenger compounds
        may help to identify upstream physiological mechanisms that
        regulate MHCK-C autophosphorylation/activation.
        Using epi-fluorescence microscopy, we observe strikingly
        different patterns of dynamic localization for MHCK-A, -B,
        and -C during polarized migration and cytokinesis. The
        dynamics of MHCK-C localization are particularly
        intriguing, with global or posterior cortical enrichment
        observed during interphase, with a dramatic accumulation in
        the furrow during late cytokinesis. The apparent absence of
        MHCK-C from the furrow in early/mid cytokinesis, when
        myosin II is clearly accumulating, suggests that specific
        regulatory mechanisms may exist to recruit this enzyme to
        the furrow during late cytokinesis.
        Co-localization of a MHCK with its apparent substrate
        does not imply that the kinase, in vivo, is actively
        phosphorylating its substrate. The dynamic localization of
        a kinase is only one way to regulate its activity. In fact,
        the MHCKs are very likely to be highly regulated enzymes;
        previous studies have documented the in vitro regulation of
        MHCK A by autophosphorylation, myosin filaments, and acidic
        phospholipids [ 32 ] , and data presented here documents
        that MHCK C can also be regulated via autophosphorylation.
        Further studies are needed to confirm similar regulation in
        vivo, and to better define the upstream regulatory
        pathways. With these caveats, the distinct localization
        patterns for MHCK-A, -B, and -C reported here provide
        valuable clues as to which spatial and temporal myosin II
        population may be acted upon by each enzyme.
        The dynamics of the three MHCKs also display striking
        differences in their dependence on myosin II. When the GFP
        fusions are imaged in myosin II null cells, both MHCK-A and
        MHCK-B display dynamics indistinguishable from their
        behaviour in cells wild type for myosin II. In contrast,
        loss of cortical and furrow localization is seen for
        GFP-MHCK-C in the absence of myosin II. This result
        suggests that MHCK-C localization in these settings may be
        achieved via direct association with myosin II filaments.
        Our TIRF studies further support this model, suggesting
        that MHCK-C may physically associate with myosin II
        filaments. GFP-MHCK-C under the TIRF microscope displayed
        short particles with a longer dimension approximately half
        of the length of myosin II thick filaments. The bare zone
        of purified wild-type myosin II thick filaments was
        estimated previously to be in the range of 0.13-0.19 μm [
        29 ] . Based upon these results, we suggest that GFP-MHCK-C
        may colocalize with myosin II thick filaments by binding at
        the bare zone.
        Comparison of the localization pattern between
        GFP-myosin II and GFP-MHCKs provides us a map of where
        these three MHCKs localize at different stages in the
        vegetative cells, as well as how these MHCKs coordinated to
        ensure proper regulation of myosin II thick filament.
        Figure 11depicts our current working model for the dynamics
        of the three MHCKs during interphase (A), early cytokinesis
        (B) and late cytokinesis (C). Localization of MHCK-A and
        MHCK-B does not require myosin II. With or without myosin
        II, both MHCK-A and MHCK-B are excluded from the cell
        cortex in interphase; and neither MHCK-A nor MHCK-B
        colocalize with regions of highest myosin II concentration
        in moving cells (Fig. 11-A). We suggest that the enrichment
        of MHCK-A to polar ruffles of dividing cells may represent
        a mechanism by which 
        D. discoideum cells locally
        disassemble myosin II filaments to facilitate the polarized
        recruitment of filaments to the forming contractile
        ring/furrow zone. This model is consistent with the recent
        report that MHCK-A displays enrichment into anterior
        F-actin-rich protrusions of polarized cells during
        chemotaxis, and into phagocytic and macropinocytotic
        extensions [ 23 ] . The polar localization of MHCK-A would
        be consistent with the long-standing "polar relaxation"
        model for cytoskeletal reorganization during cytokinesis [
        33 ] . MHCK-A may represent a factor that contributes to
        polar relaxation in this system via polar disassembly of
        myosin II filaments. The cytosolic localization of MHCK-B
        suggests that this enzyme may contribute to a continuous
        and uniform turnover of myosin II filaments throughout the
        cell, although it is possible that MHCK-B plays more
        specific roles in functions yet to be identified.
        We suggest that MHCK-C is recruited to the contractile
        ring during late cytokinesis to facilitate the orderly
        removal of excess myosin II from the ring as the furrow
        ingresses. It is particularly intriguing that MHCK-C
        colocalizes with myosin II in the furrow only at the
        culmination of cytokinesis where turnover and mobilization
        of thick filaments might be most appropriate. At this time
        the cell cycle contraction force requirements are predicted
        to fall [ 34 ] and the cell's geometrical changes would
        require myosin II thick filaments to disassemble. Although
        it is clear throughout the animal kingdom and in protozoa
        that the mass of myosin II in the division furrow decreases
        steadily with furrow ingression, no mechanism has been
        identified in any other system that can explain this
        regulated disassembly. Dynamic changes in MHC
        phosphorylation levels within the contractile ring have
        been reported in dividing sea urchin embryos [ 35 ] ,
        suggesting that MHC phosphorylation as a mechanism
        regulating furrow myosin II disassembly may occur in other
        systems besides 
        D. discoideum . We suggest that
        MHCK-C participates in this regulated myosin II filament
        disassembly in 
        D. discoideum , and that this
        function may be regulated at both the cellular and
        biochemical level.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We suggest that differential localization of MHCKs
        occurs in D. discoideum cells for the purpose of regulating
        myosin II filament assembly levels in the context of
        specific cellular contractile events such as lamellipodium
        extension and cytokinetic furrowing. The late appearance of
        MHCK-C during furrowing suggests a cellular mechanism
        regulating its localization, and our biochemical data
        suggest that MHCK-C phosphorylation levels may represent a
        mechanism for the fine-tuning of the activity of MHCK-C in
        the cleavage furrow during cell division. This level of
        regulation could be mediated via second messenger control
        of autophosphorylation, or via direct MHCK-C
        phosphorylation by other kinases. Further studies are in
        progress to test these models.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Plasmid construction
          The GFP fusions to MHCK A, MHCK B, and MHCK C were
          constructed by placing GFP at the amino-terminus of each
          kinase coding region, with GFP fused to codon 2 of each
          kinase open reading frame. All fusions were made in the
          GFP expression vector pTX-GFP [ 36 ] . The construct for
          MHCK A has been described previously [ 23 ] . Protein
          sequences for MHCK A, MHCK B, and MHCK C correspond to
          GenBank entries A55532, AAB50136, and AAC31918,
          respectively. Cloning of the cDNA encoding MHCK-C has
          been described [ 18 ] .
        
        
          FLAG-MHCK-C purification and phosphorylation
          assays
          A FLAG epitope was fused to the amino-terminus of
          MHCK-C at codon 2 using the vector pTX-FLAG [ 36 ] . The
          resulting plasmid, pTX-MKC2, was transformed into the
          cell line Ax2 and clonal cell lines were selected with
          G418 (8 μg/ml) in HL-5 medium. To facilitate FLAG-MHCK-C
          protein purification, Ax2/pTX-MKC2 cell lines were then
          subjected to incremental increases in G418 selection
          level over approximately 3 weeks, to a final selection
          level of 40 μg/ml. As reported previously for expression
          of MHCK-A [ 24 ] , this selection process resulted in
          cell lines with increased expression level of
          FLAG-MHCK-C, several-fold higher than the initial
          expression level. In previous work, when this method was
          applied to MHCK-A-expressing cell lines the elevated
          expression of MHCK-A resulted in myosin II
          hyperphosphorylation and myosin II filament disassembly,
          and corresponding loss of ability of cells to grow in
          suspension [ 24 ] . We observed the same effect in the
          current studies in attempting to force high expression of
          FLAG-MHCK-C. The pTX-MKC2 plasmid was therefore
          transfected into 3xALA myosin II cells, which are
          resistant to myosin filament hyperphosphorylation and
          disassembly due to elimination of phosphorylation target
          sites in the myosin tail [ 24 ] . The resultant
          3xALA/pTX-MKC2 cells could be propagated in suspension
          culture even after selection for elevated expression in
          40 μg/ml G418.
          For purification of FLAG-MHCK-C, 8-10 liters of
          3xALA/pTX-MKC2 cells were propagated in suspension
          culture in HL-5 medium to approximately 5 × 10 6cells/ml.
          All subsequent steps were performed at 0-4°. Cells were
          harvested by centrifugation (40-50 g typical yield), then
          washed once in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 (TBS).
          Cells were resuspended with 4 ml/g cells in 50 mM Tris pH
          8, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA. Protease inhibitor cocktails PIC1
          and PIC2 [ 22 ] from a 1000X stock were then added to 5X
          final concentration, and cells lysed either by sonication
          or by repeated douncing. Lysate was adjusted to 300 mM
          NaCl (to dissociate MHCK-C from binding to particulate
          material), then subjected to centrifugation at 125,000 ×
          g for 20 min. The resulting cleared supernatant was
          brought to 30% saturation with powdered ammonium sulfate
          and incubated with stirring for 30 min. The ammonium
          sulfate precipitate, containing the FLAG-MHCK-C protein,
          was collected by centrifugation and resuspended with
          gentle douncing in 20 ml TBS containing 1 mM EDTA (TBSE),
          and 1X PIC1 and PIC2. This sample was mixed with 2 ml of
          anti-FLAG epitope monoclonal antibody-conjugated-beads
          (M2 beads, Sigma) for 2 hours at 4°. Resin was then
          washed 3X by centrifugation with 10 ml TBSE and
          transferred to a small disposable column. Resin was
          washed with a low concentration of competing FLAG peptide
          (Sigma; 10 μg/ml in TBSE), then the column was eluted
          with 2 ml of competing FLAG peptide at 120 μg/ml in TBSE.
          Eluted protein was concentrated by dialysis against
          powdered polyethylene glycol (Aquacide; Calbiochem), then
          dialyzed into 20% glycerol, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 20 mM KCl,
          1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT. This purified FLAG-MHCK C was then
          aliquoted and stored at -80°C.
          
          Dictyostelium myosin II was
          purified as described [ 22 ] . Phosphorylation reactions
          with myosin II and FLAG-MHCK-C were performed in 20 mM
          TES pH 7, 2 mM MgCl 
          2 , and 0.5 mM ATP, with 32P-γ-ATP
          included at 800 Ci/mol final concentration. Peptide
          phosphorylation assays were done with the peptide MH-1 as
          substrate at 50 μM. This 16-residue peptide corresponds
          to the phosphorylation target site at position 2029 of
          MHC. This peptide and the filter-binding assay used to
          measure its phosphorylation have been described
          previously [ 31 ] . All peptide phosphorylation studies
          were performed under conditions in which no more than 30%
          of the substrate was consumed to ensure linear reaction
          rates.
        
        
          Antiserum production
          The catalytic domain of MHCK-C was expressed in
          bacteria and purified using nickel chelation
          chromatography as described [ 18 ] . Purified protein was
          injected into New Zealand White rabbits at two week
          intervals for a total of five injections, followed by a
          terminal bleed. Western blots were performed using total
          serum at a dilution of 1/2000 and chemiluminscent
          detection.
        
        
          GFP-Cell culture
          pTX-MKA1, pMKB-GFP, pTX-MKC1 were transformed into
          either Ax2 cell line [ 37 ] or HS1 myosin null cells, a
          strain of 
          D. discoideum with its endogenous 
          mhc A gene deleted [ 38 ] to
          generate GFP-MHCK-A, -B, and -C cells, respectively. p102
          [ 34 ] which encodes GFP-myosin II, was transformed into
          the HS1 myosin null cells.
          Transformations were performed by electroporation [ 39
          ] and transformed cells were selected by 7.5 μg/ml G418
          (Geneticin; Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). 
          D. discoideum cells expressing
          GFP-MHCK's as well as GFP-myosin II-expressing cells were
          grown and maintained in DdHL-5 media [ 40 ] supplemented
          with 60 μg/ml streptomycin, 60 U/ml penicillin and 7.5
          μg/ml G418. Bacterial lawns were prepared by spreading 2
          ml of an overnight 
          Klebsiella aerogenes culture on

          Cells were imaged in a chambered coverslip (Nunc,
          Naperville, IL) filled with MES buffer (20 mM
          2-[morpholino]ethane-sulfonic acid, pH 6.8, 0.2 mM CaCl 
          2 , 2 mM MgSO 
          4 ) at 21°C. Imaging was done as
          previously described (Sabry et al., 1997) with the
          following modifications. The light source was replaced to
          a Xe arc lamp that has 60% increase over the typical
          input power of an epi-fluorescent lamp and therefore
          delivers higher output. This is beneficial when viewing
          low GFP-expressing cells. For imaging cells reported
          here, the light was typically attenuated to between 3% to
          10% output. The output of the lamp is directed to the
          microscope by a liquid light-guide. This set up greatly
          reduces the effect of vibration and heat on the samples
          and the microscope. Images were collected and analyzed
          using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., West
          Chester, PA).
        
        
          Total internal reflection fluorescence
          microscopy
          Using an objective-typed TIRF microscopy, cells were
          imaged in an anodized aluminum imaging chamber filled
          with MES buffer (described above) through a coverslip
          with a refractive index of 1.78. GFP-protein molecules
          were excited by 488 nm photons produced from an Argon ion
          laser (Melles Griot) and a 100× (NA = 1.65) objectiv
          (Olympus). Fluorescent emission was detected through a
          PentaMax intensified CCD (Princeton Intruments).
          Typically, each movie collected by Winview (Roper
          Scientific) was 1 frame/sec for 200 sec, and was
          subsequently analyzed using NIH image. The apparent
          length of fluorescent objects was determined using NIH
          Image (National Institute of Health) to enlarge and
          identify large (> 10 fold) differences in pixel
          intensity to identity object edges using the "line-scan"
          function. Objects that were not clearly separate were
          removed from consideration."
