        The early diagnosis of ovarian cancer has the potential
        to dramatically reduce the mortality associated with this
        disease. Recently, the use of surface-enhanced laser
        desorption/ionization (SELDI) time-of-flight mass
        spectrometry profiling of patient serum proteins, combined
        with advanced data mining algorithms, to detect protein
        patterns associated with malignancy, has been reported as a
        promising field of research to achieve the goal of early
        cancer detection [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] . Several reports have
        detailed the ability of this proteomic method to diagnose
        the difference between ovarian cancer [ 6 7 8 ] , prostate
        cancer [ 9 10 11 12 13 ] , and bladder cancer [ 13 14 ] .
        Much of the effort in these analyses has focused on the use
        of a variety of data mining tools such as the evaluation of
        prostate cancer using peaks in the mass to charge (M/Z)
        region between 2 K and 40 K combined with boosted decision
        tree analysis [ 10 ] to try to detect patterns that allow
        the diagnosis of cancer versus non-cancer. The use of
        similar technology to evaluate bladder cancer has also been
        reported [ 13 14 ] . Thus, this field represents an active
        area of current research. For example, a recent report by
        the Clinical Proteomics Program Databank has demonstrated
        that the use of genetic algorithms coupled with clustering
        analysis has resulted in rule sets that can predict ovarian
        cancers (including samples from patients with stage 1
        disease) with 100% sensitivity and 96% specificity [ 6 ] .
        These results have been extended by the same group to
        include a larger series of ovarian cancer patients as well
        as prostate cancer patients [ 7 9 ] . The Clinical
        Proteomics Program Databank has provided three sets of
        ovarian cancer data to the scientific community without
        restriction. These data sets include Lancet Ovarian Data
        2-16-02 used in the study noted above [ 6 ] . This study
        consisted of a total of 100 control, 100 cancer, and 16
        benign disease samples run on a Ciphergen H4 ProteinChip
        array (since discontinued). The samples were manually
        processed. The data was posted after baseline subtraction.
        The second data set, Ovarian Dataset 4-3-02 consist of the
        same samples as the first but the samples were run on a
        Ciphergen WCX2 ProteinChip array. The samples were manually
        prepared and the data was posted with baseline subtraction.
        A model diagnostic rule based on this dataset is published
        on the website, but no data is given regarding the rules
        sensitivity or specificity. In this report, we analyze the
        third Ovarian Dataset 8-7-02 and corresponding sample
        information downloaded from the Clinical Proteomics Program
        Databank website [ 7 ] . This set of data consists of serum
        profiles of 162 subjects with ovarian cancer and 91
        non-cancer control subjects. The cancer group may be
        further divided into 28 stage 1 patients, 20 stage 2
        patients, 99 stage 3 patients, 12 stage 4 patients, and 3
        no stage specified patients. For each subject a set of data
        consisting of intensities at 15,154 distinct M/Z values
        ranging from 0.0000786 to 19995.513 was available for
        analysis. This dataset was constructed using the Ciphergen
        WCX2 ProteinChip array. All the steps of preparing the
        chips for sample analysis were preformed robotically, and
        the raw data without baseline subtraction was posted for
        download. A model rule claiming 100% sensitivity and
        specificity is also given. Additional details of
        experimental data collection may be found at the Clinical
        Proteomics Data Bank [ 5 ] . In addition to the various
        methods of preparing and running the samples on the mass
        spectrometer, the optimal steps in processing the raw data
        from the mass spectrometer for further analysis have not
        been standardized and remain a fertile area for
        investigation [ 15 ] . We choose the deliberately simple
        strategy of using Wilcoxon test on the raw data to better
        understand the underlying properties of the data set. We
        consider this simple approach a "benchmark method" to which
        other methods can be compared. Further, we use Wilcoxon
        test and stepwise discriminant analysis on a training
        subset consisting of 80 cancer patients and 45 controls,
        randomly chosen from the original data set, to develop
        rules to classify a test set consisting of the remaining
        cancer and control subjects. Disease classifiers of great
        sensitivity and specificity could be readily constructed by
        visual inspection and manual binning of M/Z values based on
        the p-values of the Wilcoxon test combined with classical
        stepwise discriminant analysis. The ability of these rules
        to classify disease and normal samples were comparable to
        the model rule published on this dataset at the Clinical
        Proteomics Program Databank website which was developed
        using a proprietary genetic algorithm. Further, in
        examining all M/Z values, the M/Z values that discriminated
        best between ovarian cancer and control were all found to
        be less than 500, an area of the spectrum often discarded
        as noise [ 10 ] . These findings are useful for several
        reasons. First, the statistical methods used in this study
        are readily available, widely understood, and can be
        cheaply implemented. Secondly, a vast amount of
        mathematical research and practical experience underlies
        their interpretation. Finally, they can be used to discover
        unexpected patterns present in the data set. These patterns
        may be missed by machine learning methods that are narrowly
        focused on diagnostic classification, and do not present
        the researcher with a broad overview of the data. As a
        result of these traditional studies, a better understanding
        of the weaknesses and possible strengths of serum proteomic
        profiling becomes apparent.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        Based on the initial training set, the intensity at each
        of the consecutive 15,154 M/Z values was first compared
        using a two-sided Wilcoxon test (see methods) Figure 1shows
        the pattern of the resulting two-sided Wilcoxon test
        p-values generated on a training set consisting of 80
        cancer patients and 45 controls randomly chosen from the
        larger data set, with the M/Z values on the x-axis and the
        negative logarithm (base 10) of the Wilcoxon test p-values
        on the y-axis. There are a total of 685 distinct M/Z values
        differing between the cancer and control populations with a
        p-value of less than 10 -6. Also of note in this
        distribution is that all M/Z values with a Wilcoxon p-value
        less than 10 -12are found at M/Z values of less than 500.
        The significance of this finding will be discussed further
        below.
        In order to determine if these data could be used to
        separate normal from cancer, we used three strategies to
        develop rules for diagnostic classification. First, all
        data points regardless of M/Z value were sorted from most
        to least significant (according to the two-sided Wilcoxon
        test p-values) and the 100 M/Z values with the lowest
        p-values were chosen. These 100 M/Z values were then
        separated into distinct bins by sorting on consecutive M/Z
        and requiring a separation of at least 1 M/Z value to start
        the next bin (12 bins were detected in this process). The
        M/Z value with the smallest p-value in each bin was
        selected. The results are shown in Table 1. Next, stepwise
        discriminate analysis was performed, and 7 M/Z values were
        selected for Rule 1 (of note, all but one M/Z value was
        below 500). When this rule was applied to the entire data
        set, test and training inclusive, all 162 cancer and 91
        controls were appropriately classified without error for
        100% sensitivity and specificity. Given that the
        interpretation of low M/Z values maybe problematic, we next
        focused attention on a set of rules which met the following
        requirements. First, the M/Z value had to exceed 2000, and
        the Wilcoxon test P-value had to be less than 10 -6. A
        total of 462 M/Z values from the training set met these
        criteria. As shown in Table 2, a total of 30 bins were
        detected by sorting on consecutive M/Z values as above, and
        the most significant p-value from each bin was selected for
        stepwise discriminant analysis. Thirteen M/Z values were
        retained in Rule 2. In the training set, one subject in the
        cancer group was misclassified as normal and one in the
        control group was misclassified as cancer. In the test set,
        two subjects from the control group were misclassified as
        cancer. Therefore for the test set, the sensitivity was
        82/82 or 100% and the specificity was 43/45 or 95.7%. For
        the test and training set combined, one subject was
        misclassified in the cancer group as normal and three
        subjects were misclassified in the control group as cancer.
        Thus for this rule the overall sensitivity was 161/162 or
        99.4 % and its overall specificity was 88/91 or 96.7 %.
        Finally, Rule 3 was constructed using the 30 M/Z values in
        Rule 2 combined with four M/Z values 409.75936, 418.11364,
        435.0751, and 464.3617 (all also used in Rule 1). This was
        done because prior studies have indicated the possible
        presence of low molecular weight biomarkers in ovarian
        cancer (see below). When this set of M/Z values was
        subjected to stepwise discriminant analysis, seven
        variables at M/Z values of 418.1136, 435.0751, 464.3617,
        4003.645, 4906.962, 6599.8232, and 6801.495 were retained.
        When Rule 3 was applied to the entire data set, test and
        training inclusive, all 162 cancer and 91 controls were
        appropriately categorized without error for 100%
        sensitivity and specificity. The actual classification
        schema for all three rules is shown in Table 3. The results
        presented with these three rules were all achieved in the
        first attempt. No effort was made to further optimize these
        rules. We next interchanged the test and training sets and
        used the same three rule development strategies. This
        resulted in:
        1) Rule 1 with M/Z values of 2.8234234, 222.41828,
        410.13727, 417.73207, 435.07512, 4027.2999, and 8035.0581,
        achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity on both the test
        and training sets.
        2) Rule 2 with M/Z values of 3676.3951, 3937.7816,
        4003.6449, 4440.095, 5269.0367, 10511.699, 14182.82, and
        17019.433. This rule achieved 100% sensitivity and
        specificity on the training set. However sensitivity and
        specificity fell on the test set to 96.25% and 91.11%
        respectively.
        3) Rule 3 with M/Z values of 417.73207, 435.07512,
        2666.361, 2674.0769, 3937.7816, 3991.8435, 4821.0481,
        4839.2088, 5269.0367, 7627.1183, 14182.82, and 17019.433.
        This rule achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity on the
        training set. On the test set it achieved a sensitivity of
        100% and a specificity of 97.8%. We have used a strategy
        identical to that used in Rule 1 to further analyze this
        data. First, a randomly ordered list of cancer spectra and
        a randomly ordered list of control spectra were prepared.
        Next, we assigned the first 20% of each list to a test set
        and the remaining 80% to a training set. The process was
        repeated five times assigning the next consecutive 20% of
        each list for the test set on each occasion. The results
        were very similar to those above with all five rules
        achieving 100% sensitivity and specificity. This data is
        posted as additional data file Supplement1.xls.
        Additional File 1
        This Excel file contains 5 work sheets. Each sheet
        contains the most significant 100 MZ values from a training
        set consisting of a different 80% subset of the data. The
        MZ values have been sorted into bins and the most
        significant MZ value from each bin (marked with a "I" in
        column E) was used in stepwise dicriminant analysis. MZ
        values retained in the final rule are indicated with an "s"
        in column F.

        The presence of statistically significant signals at M/Z
        values less than 500 was unexpected as some investigators,
        in their systems, conservatively disregard data beneath M/Z
        values of 2000 as possible noise [ 12 ] . To further
        investigate this, we first repeated the calculation of
        2-sided Wilcoxon test p-values at each of the 15,154 M/Z
        values using the entire data set (see Figure 2). The trends
        noted in the training set were present in the entire data
        set, although with increased statistical significance. For
        example 3,591 of the 15,154 M/Z values had mean intensities
        that varied between cancer and control with a p-value of 10
        -6or less. In a sample of a panel consisting of 15,154
        independent random sets of measurements split between
        cancer and control, using Wilcoxon test 15,154 times with
        an individual significance level of 10 -6, the number of
        false positives is expected to be 0.015. It is very small.
        Alternatively, in the above setting the chance that at
        least one of the 15,154 measurements would have a p-value
        less than 10 -6is approximately 1.5%. Thus it is extremely
        unlikely that a false positive would occur by chance alone
        in a 15,154 member test set. The finding of significant
        signals at M/Z values less than 500 is consistent with two
        of the seven M/Z values used in the model rule published at
        the Clinical Proteomics Program Databank website that was
        developed on the same data set (see Table 4), specifically
        M/Z values 435.46452 (p-value = 9.08 × 10 -372 ndmost
        significant of 9 values in its bin) and 465.56916 (p-value
        = 2.50 × 10 -286 thmost significant of the 7 M/Z values
        found in its bin) [ 7 ] . These values correspond to M/Z
        values of 435.0751 and 464.3617 used in Rule 1. As shown in
        Figure 3, each of these two pairs of M/Z values are
        surprisingly effective at separating the 162 cancer
        subjects from the 91 control subjects with an advantage
        noted with the first pair (compare panel A with B). Even
        more interesting is the finding that significant M/Z values
        found in the first Rule 1 included the M/Z values of
        2.7921478 and 245.53704. As shown in Figure 3, panel C,
        these two values can also significantly separate the 162
        cancer subjects from the 91 control subjects. The
        interpretation of these values is problematic, given the
        low M/Z values involved. In order to evaluate these
        findings, we first investigated whether data normalization
        as described at the Clinical Proteomics Data Bank [ 5 ]
        could influence the Wilcoxon test p-values found using the
        raw data (see methods). Several points were chosen, and no
        effect was noted on the p-values (see Table 5). We further
        analyzed several selected low M/Z values, less than 500. In
        this process, the cancer and control data were pooled. The
        pooled data were randomly partitioned between a set
        containing 91 members and a set containing 162 members. The
        Wilcoxon test was then run on the randomized set. The
        process was repeated 10,000 times, and the lowest p-values
        were chosen. As shown in Table 5, the lowest p-values
        generated by the permutation process were on the order of
        0.0001, as expected given the number of permutations
        tested. Thus, it is highly unlikely that either data
        normalization or a chance distribution could have accounted
        for the highly significant p-values noted in the M/Z region
        less than 500. Finally, it is interesting to note that the
        remaining five values in the Clinical Proteomics Program
        Databank model rule all have M/Z values greater than 2000
        and relatively high p-values. Specifically the remaining
        values are (note that the p-values are calculated from the
        entire data set):
        1) M/Z = 2760.6685, p = 0.24
        2) M/Z = 19643.409, p = 0.52
        3) M/Z = 6631.7043, p = 9.0 × 10 -4
        4) M/Z = 14051.976, p = 1.8 × 10 -8
        5) M/Z = 3497.5508, p = 1.4 × 10 -6
        By contrast all the M/Z values used in Rule 1 have
        p-values less than 10 -26(compare Table 1with Table 4).
        There are several non-exclusive explanations for the
        presence of significant P-values in M/Z region less than
        500. First, these may actually represent biomarkers that
        correlate with ovarian cancer. The disease process may
        influence the serum concentration of lipids, or other small
        molecules that either bind to the chip directly or through
        a complex formation with other macromolecules (e.g.,
        binding to a receptor). For example, the lysophospholipids
        represent a class of compounds that have an important role
        in extracellular signaling. Lysophophatidic Acid (LPA) is a
        member of this class of compounds, and its plasma levels
        have been proposed as a potential biomarker for ovarian
        cancer [ 16 17 ] . LPA is a family of related molecules
        with molecular weights in the vicinity of 400 to 600
        Daltons, and a variety of LPA species has been reported to
        be increased in malignant ascites from patients with
        ovarian cancer as detected by electrospray ionization mass
        spectrometry (ESI-MS) [ 18 ] . LPA related species have
        also been reported to be increased in plasma samples from
        patients with ovarian cancer using a combination of thin
        layer chromatography (to isolate an "LPA band" from patient
        plasma) followed by ESI-MS. This study reported significant
        LPA increases in cancer samples with increased intensities
        noted at M/Z values of 409, 433-437, 457, 481-482, 571,
        599, and 619. This report also reviews the evidence that
        these M/Z values are consistent with LPA family members [
        19 ] . Figure 4shows the average intensities and p-values
        for both the cancer and control groups in the region
        between M/Z values of 410 to 470. Among other features, an
        increase in the mean intensity for cancers at a peak
        centered at an M/Z of 459 is noted. However, also of note
        in this region are:
        1) M/Z = 464.3617 with a p-value less than 6.8 × 10 -35,
        that correlates with a shoulder in a secondary peak at
        about 463, that is decreased in cancer patients (average
        intensity 17.5 for cancer versus 23.6 for controls).
        2) M/Z = 435.0751 with a p-value of less than 3.9 × 10
        -37, that corresponds to a peak with increased intensity in
        cancer (average intensity 33 for cancer versus 25.5 for
        controls).
        3) M/Z = 417.73207 with a p-value less than 6.2 × 10
        -35, that corresponds to a peak that is decreased in cancer
        (average intensity 39.5 for cancer versus 47.4 for
        controls)
        The identity of the molecules responsible for these
        differences cannot be determined from this data. However,
        it is possible that in some cases they may relate to the
        LPA family of molecules, or to alterations in proteins that
        bind LPA family members.
        Other explanations for the presence of statistically
        significant bands of low M/Z include degradation products
        of higher molecular weight macromolecules or a matrix
        effect. For example, if a set of proteins exist that are
        expressed at different levels between cancer and control
        subjects but have a common domain, then a common product
        ion of lower M/Z may be generated that would represent a
        summation of all the changes in expression of the group of
        proteins, and might thus have greater statistical
        significance than the changes associated with any single
        high M/Z value. Similarly, a set of low M/Z molecules
        (e.g., energy-absorbing molecule or matrix) that interacts
        differently in a protein environment that differs markedly
        between cancer and control could hypothetically generate a
        similar phenomenon. However, it is difficult to apply any
        of the above explanations to the very low M/Z values such
        as 2.7921478 and 245.53704, although in the last case an
        extremely small organic molecule is possible.
        Alternatively, there maybe some unexpected experimental
        bias or systematic error that accounts for low M/Z
        discrimination. This could occur at any experimental step,
        and might include medication or lifestyle change that
        occurs in patients who learn they have a cancer diagnosis,
        variation in sample collection, processing and
        preservation, as well as bias introduced at the time of
        analysis. In the case of LPA, increased plasma levels may
        be associated with platelet activation. Another group
        trying to repeat the observations of increased levels of
        LPA associated with ovarian cancer concluded that there was
        no diagnostic value in the assay, and attributed the
        discrepant findings as possibly related to different sample
        centrifugation protocols used by the two groups to remove
        platelets from the samples prior to analysis [ 20 ] .
        However, LPA continues to be actively evaluated for its
        clinical utility [ 21 ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        Serum proteomic profiling is a new approach to cancer
        diagnosis. However it confronts a challenging environment,
        as it combines measurement technologies that are new in the
        clinical setting with novel approaches to processing and
        interpreting high dimensional data. Further, controlling
        large clinical studies can be challenging even in more
        established settings. Nevertheless, it represents an
        advance in the ability to diagnose and understand illness.
        The results presented in this study are useful for several
        reasons. First, in regard to disease classification,
        advanced data mining techniques should be benchmarked
        against traditional methods when possible. Further
        identical training sets should be defined for such a
        comparison as results may very depending on the samples
        chosen for inclusion in the training set. The development
        of disease classifiers using routine analysis proved to be
        straightforward, and resulted in excellent performance in
        both the test and training sets (e.g. 100% sensitivity and
        specificity for Rules 1 and 3 in the first training set).
        In particular these preliminary data suggest that these two
        rules may be specific enough to scale to larger population
        trials without generating an unacceptably high false
        positive rate. This study also confirms that a classifier
        could be developed with M/Z values greater than 2000. This
        indicates that information regarding the difference between
        cancer and control is present throughout the entire M/Z
        region studied, a result entirely consistent with the
        observed Wilcoxon test p-values. Secondly, routine analysis
        allows investigators to rapidly review the data for their
        general trends, and correlate the findings with other
        information. The findings of significant discrimination
        between cancer and control groups at low M/Z values
        indicates that attention should be focused in this region.
        In particular, if experimental bias and noise effects can
        be excluded, this region may prove to offer the optimum for
        ovarian cancer diagnostic test development. On the other
        hand, if bias cannot be excluded, the possibility must be
        entertained that higher M/Z values may also have been
        similarly affected. In order to address these issues,
        consideration may be given to using mass spectrometry
        methods with increased sensitivity in the low M/Z region.
        The experimental conditions used to physically bind the
        serum samples to the chip prior to analysis may also prove
        critical, and should be consistent with those used in
        collecting the current data set. Also, the possibility that
        the changes in the low M/Z region may represent an additive
        effect caused by differing protein environments between
        cancer and normal may be approached by intentionally
        spiking samples with panels of known proteins, and
        determining if there is an effect on the spectra in the low
        M/Z region. The use of internal standards to normalize this
        type of experimental system in general may also be
        considered. As with all clinical test development,
        confirmation of results in independent laboratories running
        blinded samples will remain the gold standard in ruling out
        the possible effects of bias, unless the sample set itself
        contains the bias. Particular attention should be paid to
        pre-analytic causes of bias that may influence the serum
        proteome. In particular the coagulation and complement
        systems should be considered as potential sources of noise
        in this context, as both are activated during serum sample
        collection and generate low molecular weight products.
        These products are undesirable for two reasons. First, if a
        putative tumor biomarker (e.g. LPA) is a member of a
        pathway altered during serum sample collection, changes
        between plasma levels of cancer and control subjects may be
        obscured. Secondly, the generation of activation products
        may simply complicate the spectrum. Also, sample collection
        practices should be rigorously defined, and include
        submitting matched control and cancer samples from all
        centers participating in the study. Matching for age and
        menopausal status should be considered. For example, in the
        data set used in this study, the mean age of the control
        group was 47 years and the cancer group 60 years. It is
        noteworthy that the average age of menopause is
        approximately 51 years [ 22 ] . This may introduce a bias
        in the results reported in this study as well as all others
        derived from this dataset. Finally, the steps associated
        with sample collection, processing, and binding to the chip
        may represent a particularly fertile area for research. Any
        combination of such steps may significantly alter the
        molecular subset of the sample that can be successfully
        analyzed.
        However, the ability to discriminate between cancer and
        control based on the M/Z values of 2.79 and 245.5 reveals
        the presence of a significant experimental bias not related
        to disease pathology, that likely involves machine noise
        and matrix effects. This is particularly true of the M/Z
        value at 2.79 which represents a bias of the mass
        spectrometer instrument itself. If this is the case the
        higher M/Z regions may also be affected. These findings
        indicate that any rule derived from this data set,
        including the ones presented in this paper, may be
        detecting differences in experimental bias and not disease
        pathology. Investigators in this field may minimize their
        chances of false discovery by careful experimental design
        and by using routine statistical methods to both overview
        the data (in an intentional search for bias) as well as a
        benchmark for comparison with other data mining
        algorithms.
      
      
        Methods
        A training set was formed by randomly sampling 45
        spectra out of the 91 controls and 80 spectra out of the
        162 cancer cases (see Figure 1). Those spectra that were in
        the original data set but not in the training set were
        considered in a 'test' set. Two-sided Wilcoxon test was
        used to compare the intensity between the controls and
        cancers in the training set at each of the 15,154 M/Z
        values. We then selected a subset of the M/Z values with
        the lowest Wilcoxon test p-values (see the Results section
        for details). We sorted on consecutive M/Z values to get
        bins. A separation of at least one M/Z value was required
        to start the next bin. The lowest p-value in each bin was
        selected and the corresponding M/Z value was used in
        stepwise discriminant analysis to determine the subset of
        M/Z values that best discriminated cancer from control in
        the training set. The criteria were applied to the test
        data set, and sensitivity and specificity were computed.
        All the analyses were performed in SAS Version 8.2 (A
        statistical package from SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA)
        on a personal computer. Wilcoxon test was performed using
        NPAR1WAY procedure in SAS, stepwise discriminant analysis
        was performed using STEPDISC procedure in SAS, and
        discriminant analysis was performed using DISCRIM procedure
        in SAS [ 23 ] .
        To normalize the data, the procedure outlined by the
        Clinical Proteomics Program Databank was used [ 24 ] . The
        cancer and control values for each M/Z were given
        respective labels, and the data were then pooled and
        normalized using the formula NV = (V-Min)/(Max - Min). In
        this expression, Min is the minimum intensity of the pooled
        samples, Max represents the maximum intensity found in the
        pooled samples, and NV represents the normalized value.
        Using this procedure, the data intensities will all fall
        between 0 and 1. The data points were sorted into cancer
        and controls, and the p-values were calculated.
