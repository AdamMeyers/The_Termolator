        In this investigation, we explored the potential
        cytotoxic interaction between LPS and CEES using a murine
        macrophage cell line (RAW264.7). CEES is a monofunctional
        analog of sulfur mustard (bis-2-(chloroethyl)sulfide) which
        a bifunctional vesicant and a chemical warfare agent. Both
        bis-2-(chloroethyl)sulfide) and CEES are known to provoke
        acute inflammatory responses in skin [ 1 2 3 ] . The
        resulting skin blistering is thought to involve the
        stimulation of specific protease(s) [ 4 ] . Apoptosis is
        now considered a possible molecular mechanism whereby CEES
        induces cytotoxicity [ 5 6 ] .
        LPS is a major component of the cell wall of
        gram-negative bacteria and is known to trigger a variety of
        inflammatory reactions in macrophages and other cells
        having CD14 receptors [ 7 8 ] . In particular, LPS is known
        to stimulate the macrophage secretion of nitric oxide [ 9 ]
        and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis
        factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta)
        [ 10 ] . For this reason, we also determined if TNF-alpha
        or IL-1-beta were capable of enhancing the cytotoxic
        effects of CEES.
        LPS stimulation of macrophages is known to involve the
        activation of protein phosphorylation by kinases as well as
        the activation of nuclear transcription factors such as
        NF-kappaB [ 10 11 12 13 ] . The activation of protein
        kinase C (PKC) by diacylglycerol is also a key event in LPS
        macrophage activation [ 8 ] . 
        In vitro experiments have shown that
        the secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-1-beta by LPS-stimulated
        monocytes is dependent upon PKC activation [ 13 14 ] . In
        this study, we also determined if phorbol myristate acetate
        (PMA) activation of PKC also enhanced CEES toxicity.
        Evidence suggests that LPS [ 15 16 ] as well as TNF-alpha [
        17 ] stimulate the production of free radicals by
        macrophages. Our long-term goal is to understand the
        molecular mechanism of sulfur mustard toxicity and to
        determine if free radical production plays an important
        role in this toxicity.
        In our experiments, cytotoxicity was measured by a
        decrease in the optical density by the MTT
        ((3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
        bromide) assay or by an increase in the fluorescence of
        propidium iodide (PI). The MTT assay is based on reduction
        of MTT by actively growing cells to produce a blue formazan
        product with absorbance at 575 nm. A low MTT absorbance
        indicates cell death. The PI assay differentiates between
        live and dead cells. Cells that have lost membrane
        integrity cannot exclude PI, which emits a red fluorescence
        after binding to cellular DNA or double stranded RNA. A
        high PI% indicates cell death.
      
      
        Results
        
          Cytotoxic interaction between LPS and CEES as
          measured by the MTT assay
          RAW 264.7 macrophages were incubated with LPS (100
          ng/ml), CEES (500 μM) or both agents for 24 hours and
          cell viability then measured by the MTT assay. As shown
          in Figure 1, we found that LPS-stimulated RAW264.7
          macrophages were markedly more susceptible (p < 0.05)
          to CEES toxicity (24 hr) than resting macrophages as
          indicated by the dramatic drop in dehydrogenase activity.
          In the absence of LPS, CEES at a level of 500 μM did not
          significantly affect cell viability as measured by the
          MTT assay.
          The characteristics of CEES toxicity to LPS-stimulated
          RAW 264.7 macrophages were further characterized by
          varying the concentrations of both LPS and CEES. The MTT
          data in Figure 2show that very low levels (25 ng/ml) of
          LPS dramatically enhanced the toxicity of CEES (measured
          after 24 hr) to macrophages at concentrations > 300
          μM. In general, LPS levels beyond 25 ng/ml did not
          further enhance the toxicity of CEES. However, LPS level
          at a level of 100 ng/ml significantly increased the
          cytotoxicity of 300 μM CEES compared to LPS activated
          RAW265.7 cells not treated with CEES. Statistical
          analyses indicate that cells treated with 100 μM CEES
          were not significantly different from control cells (not
          treated with CEES) in the presence of 0, 25 or 50 ng/ml
          of LPS. However, at a LPS level of 100 ng/ml, cells
          treated with 100 μM CEES showed a great MTT optical
          density than control cells. This might be due to a slight
          mitogenic response to low levels of CEES.
        
        
          Time course for the cytotoxic interaction between
          LPS and CEES as measured by the propidium iodide (PI)
          assay
          In order to insure that our results could be
          reproduced with an alternative assay for cell viability,
          we also utilized the propidium iodide (PI) assay. In this
          assay, the percent fluorescence increase over the control
          cells (i.e., 100 × (PI 
          treatment -PI 
          control )/PI 
          control ) indicates cytotoxicity. For
          each experiment, the value for the control cells is zero
          and is not, therefore, shown. Figure 3indicates that the
          PI assay provides the same qualitative results as the MTT
          assay, i.e., a synergistic toxic interaction between CEES
          (500 μM) and LPS (20 ng/ml). Moreover, the cytotoxic
          interaction between LPS and CEES was noticeable after 6
          hours (p < 0.05) and reached a maximum 12 hours after
          exposure. After 24 hours, CEES (500 μM) was significantly
          toxic to RAW 264.7 macrophages even in the absence of
          LPS. LPS alone was never significantly different than
          cells with no treatment, which always has a zero percent
          PI% increase.
        
        
          TNF-alpha and IL-1beta also enhance the cytotoxic
          effect of CEES
          LPS from Gram-negative bacteria binds to CD14 and
          initiates a complex signal transduction pathway involving
          the Toll receptor family, which eventually results in the
          synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha
          and IL-1beta. We, therefore, investigated the potential
          roles of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in enhancing CEES
          cytotoxicity. Table 1shows that IL-1beta (50 ng/ml) and
          CEES (500 μM) are significantly more cytotoxic (after 24
          hours) when administered together than when administered
          alone. In this experiment, LPS (25 ng/ml) and CEES (500
          μM) combined gave PI(%) and MTT values of 120.8 ± 2.3 and
          0.25 ± 0.07, respectively. These MTT data suggest that
          LPS, at 25 ng/ml, is able to enhance the toxicity of CEES
          (an MTT value of 0.25 ± 0.07) to a greater extent (p <
          0.05) than IL-1beta at 50 ng/ml (an MTT value of 0.74 ±
          0.07). The ternary mixture of LPS (25 ng/ml), IL-1beta
          (50 ng/ml) and CEES (500 μM) was not found to be more
          cytotoxic than LPS (25 ng/ml) and CEES (500 μM).
          Table 2shows completely analogous data with TNF-alpha,
          i.e., an amplification of CEES toxicity (after 24 hours)
          in the presence of the inflammatory cytokine. In this
          experiment, LPS at 25 ng/ml plus CEES (at 500 μM) gave
          PI(%) and MTT values of 62.6 ± 1.4 and 0.32 ± 0.05,
          respectively. This indicates that TNF-alpha at 50 ng/ml
          is not as potent at LPS (at 25 ng/ml) in enhancing the
          cytotoxicity of CEES at 500 μM. TNF-alpha combined with
          LPS (in the absence of CEES) was found to not exert any
          cytotoxic effect on the RAW264.7 macrophages.
          Protein kinase C is a non-receptor serine/threonine
          kinase that is maximally active in the presence of
          diacylglycerol and calcium ions. 
          In vitro experiments by Coffey et
          al. [ 14 ] have shown that TNF-alpha and IL-1beta
          secretion and mRNA accumulation by monocytes following
          LPS treatment is dependent on PKC activity. Phorbol
          12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is a specific activator of
          group A and group B protein kinase C. We wanted to
          determine, therefore, if protein kinase C activation by
          PMA would enhance the toxicity of CEES. As shown in Table
          3, the combination of PMA (50 ng/ml) and CEES (500 μM)
          was more cytotoxic (after 24 hours) toward the RAW264.7
          macrophages than LPS or CEES alone. However, as was the
          case with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, PMA was not as
          effective as LPS in enhancing CEES toxicity.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have found that inflammatory agents such as LPS,
        TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and PMA amplify the cytotoxicity of
        CEES to RAW264.7 macrophages. There is evidence suggesting
        that CEES can modulate levels of inflammatory cytokines but
        this information is controversial and inconsistent.
        Cultured monocytes exposed to CEES show a transient
        increase in TNF-alpha [ 18 ] . Similarly, cultured normal
        human keratinocytes exposed to CEES show a transient
        increase in both TNF-alpha and IL-1beta [ 19 20 ] . In
        contrast to the results of Arroyo et al. [ 18 19 20 ] ,
        Ricketts et al. [ 21 ] found that IL-1beta or TNF-alpha
        protein did not increase in sulfur mustard-exposed mouse
        skin. Blaha et al. [ 1 ] , using an 
        in vitro human skin model, found that
        CEES treatment resulted in a decreased level of
        IL-1alpha.
        Sabourin et al. [ 3 ] also addressed this issue and
        studied the 
        in vivo temporal sequence of
        inflammatory cytokine gene expression in sulfur mustard
        exposed mouse skin. These investigators found an increase
        in IL-1beta mRNA levels after 3 hours that dramatically
        increased between 6-24 hours post exposure [ 3 ] .
        Moreover, immunohistochemical studies showed an increase in
        tissue levels of IL-1beta [ 3 ] . The 
        in vitro results reported here
        support a role for inflammatory cytokines in the mechanism
        and kinetics of CEES toxicity. Our unique findings with
        regards to LPS are significant because they demonstrate
        that this bacterial endotoxin enhances CEES toxicity even
        when present at extremely low levels, i.e., nanograms of
        LPS per ml.
        LPS is ubiquitous and is present in serum, tap water,
        and dust. Military and civilian personnel would, indeed,
        always have some degree of exposure to environmental LPS,
        which could increase the toxicity of sulfur mustard. In
        addition, there is always the possibility of purposeful LPS
        exposure. Our primary future goals are to understand the
        general mechanism for the enhanced toxicity of CEES in the
        presence of inflammatory agents and use this information to
        develop effective countermeasures. Our experiments with PMA
        (Table 3) suggest that the activation of protein kinase C
        may play a key role in molecular mechanism whereby LPS
        enhances the cytotoxic of CEES.
        In experiments that will be reported elsewhere, we have
        found the antioxidants such as RRR-alpha-tocopherol and
        N-acetylcysteine are effective in reducing the cytotoxic
        effects of CEES on LPS-stimulated macrophages. We have also
        initiated experiments to distinguish the roles of apoptosis
        and necrosis in the observation reported here.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our results suggest that that LPS dramatically enhances
        the toxicity of sulfur mustard. Since LPS is a ubiquitous
        agent in the natural environment, its presence is likely to
        be an important variable influencing the cytotoxicity of
        sulfur mustard toxicity. LPS is known to stimulate the
        production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and
        IL-1beta in human monocytes [ 10 ] . We, therefore, also
        determined if these cytokines influenced the cytotoxicity
        of CEES. The data in Tables 1and 2demonstrate that both
        these cytokines enhance the cytotoxicity of CEES as
        measured by either the MTT assay or the PI assay.
        Inhibition of protein kinase C is known to block the
        secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta [ 10 ] whereas
        stimulation of protein kinase C promotes TNF-alpha and
        IL-1beta production [ 22 ] . The data reported in Table
        3show that stimulation of protein kinase C activity by PMA
        also enhances the cytotoxicity of CEES. Collectively, the
        data reported here provide the basis for future experiments
        attempting to determine the signal transduction mechanisms
        whereby inflammatory agents enhance sulfur mustard
        cytotoxicity.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Materials
          LPS (Escherichia Coli Serotype 0111:B4) and PMA
          (Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate) were purchased from
          Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis, MO. Murine IL-1-beta was
          obtained from Research Diagnostic Inc. (Flanders, NJ).
          r-TNF-alpha (human) was obtained from Promega Co
          (Madison, WI).
        
        
          Cell culture and treatments
          RAW264.7 murine macrophage-like cells (American Type
          Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured at 37°C
          in a humidified incubator (95% air with 5% CO 
          2 ) in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal
          bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml
          streptomycin (GiBcoBRL Grand Island, NY). Adherent cells
          were subcultured over night in 96 well Costar tissue
          culture plates in serum-free RPMI with 0.1% BSA
          (RPMI-0.1%BSA).
        
        
          MTT assay for determination of cell
          viability
          This assay for cell viability is based on the
          reduction of
          3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
          bromide (MTT) by mitochondrial dehydrogenase in viable
          cells to produce a purple formazan product. Schweitzer et
          al. [ 23 ] have shown that this assay provides linearity
          between optical density and cell number. This assay was
          performed by a slight modification of the method
          described by Wasserman et al. [ 24 25 ] . Briefly, at the
          end of each experiment, cells cultured in 96 well plates
          (with 100 μl of medium per well) were incubated with MTT
          (20 μl of 5 μg/ml per well) at 37°C for 4 hours. The
          formazan product was solubilized by addition of 100 μl of
          dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 100 μl of 10% SDS (in 0.01
          M HCl) for 16 hours at 37°C. The dehydrogenase activity
          was expressed as the absorbance (read with a Molecular
          Devices microplate reader) of the formazan product at 575
          nm.
        
        
          Dye exclusion assay (PI assay)
          This assay uses propidium iodide (PI) dye to
          differentiate live and dead cell [ 26 27 28 ] . Cells
          that have lost membrane integrity cannot exclude PI,
          which emits a red fluorescence after binding to cellular
          DNA or double stranded RNA. After each experiment, cells
          were washed with PBS and incubated with 200 μl of RPMI
          medium with 5 μg/ml PI for five minutes at room
          temperature. PI fluorescence was measured using a
          Fluostar Galaxy microplate reader using an excitation
          wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 650
          nm. We expressed the results as the percent increase in
          the fluorescence of treated cells over the fluorescence
          of control cells (no treatments), i.e., 100 × (PI 
          treatment -PI 
          control )/PI 
          control )
        
        
          Statistical analyses
          Means among treatments were compared by one-way ANOVA
          followed by the Scheffe test with a significance level of
          0.05. In both the Tables and Figures, means not sharing a
          common letter are significantly different (p < 0.05).
          Means sharing a common letter are not significantly
          different. The means and standard deviations of three
          independent experiments are provided in both the Figures
          and Tables.
