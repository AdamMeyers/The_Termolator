        Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) is a randomized,
        two-component clinical trial sponsored by the National
        Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). A double-blind,
        active-controlled hypertension component is designed to
        compare the rate of fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or
        nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (the primary endpoint)
        in high-risk hypertensive participants, aged 55 years or
        older, between those randomized to treatment initiated with
        a diuretic (chlorthalidone) and treatment initiated with
        each of three alternative antihypertensive drugs: a
        calcium-channel blocker (amlodipine), an
        angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor (lisinopril),
        or an alpha-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin). An open-label
        lipid-lowering component is designed to determine if
        lowering LDL cholesterol with pravastatin compared to
        "usual care" reduces all-cause mortality in a subset of
        moderately hypercholesterolemic patients. Randomization to
        the hypertension component began in February, 1994, and
        continued through January, 1998, with 42,418 participants
        recruited at 623 clinical centers in the United States,
        Canada, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.
        Randomization of 10,355 participants into the lipid trial
        ended May 31, 1998. Follow-up on all participants continued
        through March, 2002 [ 1 ] .
        Following independent reviews by the Data and Safety
        Monitoring Board (DSMB) on January 6, 2000, and by an Ad
        Hoc Committee on January 21, 2000, the Director of the
        National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute accepted a
        recommendation to discontinue the doxazosin treatment arm
        of the antihypertensive trial. This recommendation was
        based on the low probability of doxazosin showing benefit
        over chlorthalidone for the primary endpoint, as well as
        the significantly increased occurrence of the secondary
        endpoint, combined cardiovascular disease (CVD)
        (encompassing CHD deaths, nonfatal MI, stroke, coronary
        revascularization procedures [coronary artery bypass graft
        or CABG, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or
        PTCA/stent], angina [hospitalized or treated as an
        outpatient], heart failure [HF/treated in the hospital or
        as an outpatient], and peripheral arterial disease
        [in-hospital or outpatient revascularization]) in the
        doxazosin arm (RR 1.25; 95% CI, 1.17-1.33; 
        P < .001), with a doubling of risk
        of HF (fatal, hospitalized and treated but nonhospitalized)
        (RR 2.04; 95% CI, 1.79-2.32; 
        P < .001). When only fatal and
        hospitalized HF were analyzed, the large difference
        remained (RR 1.83; 95% CI, 1.58-2.13; 
        P < .001). The findings and
        operational aspects of stopping the doxazosin arm of the
        study have been previously described [ 2 3 4 ] .
        The observed increase in HF in the doxazosin group as
        compared to the chlorthalidone group led to several
        additional analyses aimed toward validation of the
        diagnoses, with a focus on hospitalized and fatal HF. The
        purposes of these analyses were: 1) to evaluate the reality
        of HF cases, i.e. whether diagnosis, management, and
        clinical course were what might be expected, and 2) to
        compare these features between the two treatment
        groups.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study Design
          The rationale and design of ALLHAT are described in
          detail elsewhere [ 1 ] . Briefly, those eligible for
          randomization had systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at
          least 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure of at
          least 90 mm Hg, or took medication for hypertension, and
          had at least one other risk factor for CHD events. Risk
          factors included previous MI or stroke, left ventricular
          hypertrophy by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram,
          history of type 2 diabetes, current cigarette smoking,
          and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level.
          The primary endpoint of the blood pressure (BP) trial
          is the composite of nonfatal MI and fatal CHD. The four
          protocol-defined secondary clinical outcomes are
          all-cause mortality, combined CHD (including CHD death,
          nonfatal MI, coronary revascularization procedures and
          hospitalized angina), stroke, and combined CVD (including
          CHD death, nonfatal MI, stroke, coronary
          revascularization procedures, angina treated in the
          hospital or as an outpatient, lower extremity peripheral
          arterial disease treated in the hospital or with
          outpatient revascularization, and HF, fatal or treated in
          the hospital or as an outpatient).
          The validation of HF diagnosis entailed answering
          several questions:
          1. Did HF cases meet ALLHAT diagnostic criteria?
          2. Were baseline characteristics and medical
          management for HF cases as expected and similar across
          the drug groups?
          3. Were prevalence and severity of systolic
          dysfunction as expected and similar across drug
          groups?
          4. Were case-fatality rates as expected and similar
          across drug groups?
          Unless otherwise specified, all data for these
          analyses were collected as of December, 1999.
        
        
          Heart Failure Diagnosis
          At each follow-up clinic visit the occurrence of study
          clinical events was assessed, and, if identified by the
          clinical investigator, reported on an endpoint form. For
          each event involving hospitalization, a hospital
          discharge summary or expiration summary was to be
          submitted, and for each death a death certificate was
          required. Endpoint forms and supporting documentation
          were reviewed at the ALLHAT Clinical Trials Center (CTC)
          for accuracy and appropriateness. When a discrepancy or
          ambiguity was found, the CTC sent a written query to the
          Principal Investigator, who retained the final word
          concerning the diagnosis or cause of death. A random 10%
          sample of strokes, nonfatal MIs and CHD deaths was
          selected for blinded quality control evaluation by the
          ALLHAT Endpoints Subcommittee; for these cases additional
          documentation was requested.
          No such routine Endpoints Subcommittee quality control
          was initially planned for reported HF. However, the
          Subcommittee was subsequently called upon to evaluate a
          random sample of reported fatal and hospitalized nonfatal
          HF events. As this occurred prior to the termination of
          the doxazosin arm, neither the chair nor the members of
          the Subcommittee was informed of the major reason for
          this review, namely, the trend toward a higher HF event
          rate in the doxazosin group compared to the
          chlorthalidone group. The Subcommittee was told that the
          review was undertaken at the request of the DSMB to
          address the reliability and validity of reported HF
          events. This evaluation consisted of fifty events, evenly
          distributed across the four treatment groups, reported as
          fatal or hospitalized nonfatal HF and with
          protocol-required documentation (discharge summary for
          hospitalized events, death certificates for deaths).
          Additional material was not requested, since this would
          have posed an undue burden on the clinical site staff and
          would have risked raising questions about emerging
          differences among treatment groups.
          The ALLHAT definition of HF, used previously in the
          Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) [ 5 ]
          , includes "patients with clear-cut signs or symptoms of
          left or right ventricular dysfunction that cannot be
          attributed to other causes..." The diagnosis of HF must
          include at least one of four stated symptoms [paroxysmal
          nocturnal dyspnea, dyspnea at rest, New York Heart
          Classification functional class III (for definition see
          Additional Information, Item 1), or orthopnea], and one
          of seven stated signs (rales, 2+ or greater ankle edema,
          tachycardia of 120 beats/minute or more after five
          minutes at rest, cardiomegaly by chest x-ray, chest x-ray
          characteristic of HF, S 
          3 gallop, or jugular venous
          distention). Since lower extremity edema or exertional
          dyspnea may be due to non-cardiac causes, the presence of
          either of these alone, without other indications of heart
          failure, is not sufficient for a diagnosis of HF. Study
          guidelines caution against a hasty HF diagnosis in
          patients with severe pulmonary disease, including chronic
          obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, or other
          severe, documented lung disease.
        
        
          Baseline Characteristics and Medical
          Management
          Baseline characteristics of chlorthalidone and
          doxazosin participants were compared. These analyses were
          stratified by HF outcome: 1) fatal and hospitalized HF;
          2) treated, non-hospitalized HF; and, 3) no HF.
          Post-HF event medical management may provide
          additional evidence of the physicians' confidence in the
          HF diagnosis. The post-event use of open-label diuretics,
          ACE-inhibitors, and beta-blockers, i.e., accepted
          treatments for HF [ 6 7 8 9 ] , was compared between
          doxazosin and chlorthalidone groups, as was the
          proportion in each group of those who remained on
          assigned blinded medication after the event. (For study
          guidelines regarding the use and reporting of open-label
          medicines of the same class as the blinded drugs, see
          Additional Information, Items 2 and 3.)
        
        
          Ejection Fraction Review
          A CTC physician plus non-medical staff reviewed in a
          blinded fashion 361 hospitalized HF events (representing
          278 participants) for ejection fraction data: looking for
          whether an ejection fraction was measured, the method
          utilized, and the measurement. Results, tabulated by
          randomization groups, reflected data that had been
          collected up to July, 1999, the time of the review.
        
        
          Case-Fatality Rates and Causes of Death
          As a measure of the diagnostic validity and severity
          of HF and comparability between drug groups,
          time-from-event-to-death analyses of participants with
          hospitalized or treated HF were compared between the two
          groups. Causes of death of such participants were also
          compared in the doxazosin and chlorthalidone groups.
        
        
          Statistical Analyses
          Data were analyzed according to participants'
          randomization assignments and HF outcome status,
          regardless of subsequent medication adherence. The
          Kaplan-Meier method was utilized in calculating
          cumulative event rates. Descriptive statistics by
          treatment groups were presented for baseline
          characteristics, HF ascertainment, ejection fractions and
          use of HF medications. Comparability of baseline
          characteristics of the treatment and HF outcome groups
          was ascertained by the χ 2test for categorical variables
          and standard normal (z) test for continuous
          variables.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Heart Failure Diagnostic Criteria
          The blinded review by the Endpoints Subcommittee of 50
          fatal or hospitalized HF events from the 4 drug groups
          determined 11 (22%) to have incomplete data for a
          definitive review. Of the remaining 39, 33 (85%) were
          confirmed to have HF by one or both reviewers. For both
          the chlorthalidone and doxazosin groups, the diagnosis of
          HF was confirmed in 90% (18/20).
        
        
          Baseline Characteristics
          Baseline characteristics for the doxazosin and
          chlorthalidone treatment groups, stratified for HF
          status, are described in Table 1.
          Baseline characteristics of doxazosin and
          chlorthalidone participants with subsequent hospitalized
          or fatal HF were compared. Doxazosin participants with
          hospitalized or fatal HF had a higher baseline SBP than
          the chlorthalidone participants (150.1 vs. 147.8 mm Hg at
          the randomization visit). More doxazosin participants had
          LVH by ECG (22.3% vs. 20.5% of chlorthalidone
          participants); slightly more chlorthalidone than
          doxazosin participants had LVH by echocardiogram. Several
          eligibility risk factors, including previous MIs or
          strokes, coronary revascularization procedures, other
          atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and ST-T
          wave changes, were reported more often in chlorthalidone
          than in doxazosin participants, though the differences
          were not significant. Chlorthalidone and doxazosin
          participants with hospitalized or fatal HF had similar
          pre-trial antihypertensive treatment durations. None of
          these differences was significant at 
          P < .05.
          Participants with HF events displayed higher rates of
          most cardiovascular risk factors compared to those
          without HF events. Approximately 35-36% of chlorthalidone
          and doxazosin participants with fatal or hospitalized HF
          had reported prior MI or stroke as baseline eligibility
          risk factors, compared to 22-23% of those without HF ( 
          P < .001). Participants with
          hospitalized/fatal HF had significantly higher rates of
          pre-randomization coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs)
          and coronary angioplasties (19-23% of those with HF vs.
          13% of those without; 
          P < .001) and other
          atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (29-33% of
          those with HF vs. 23-25% of those without; 
          P < .001). Diabetes as a
          baseline risk factor occurred more frequently in those
          with HF: 47-48% in those with HF, 35-36% in those without
          ( 
          P < .001). Left ventricular
          hypertrophy (LVH) by ECG was a risk factor in 21-22% of
          those who later developed HF, compared with 16% of those
          in each group who did not develop HF ( 
          P < .001).
          Baseline pulse pressure (PP) showed some variation
          between participants who did and did not develop HF. For
          participants with subsequent hospitalization or death
          from HF, PP was 67 and 68 mm Hg for the chlorthalidone
          and doxazosin groups, respectively. Treated,
          non-hospitalized participants showed a lower mean
          baseline PP of 65 (chlorthalidone group) and 64 mm Hg
          (doxazosin group), and an even lower mean PP in those
          without HF (62 mm Hg in each group).
        
        
          Medical Management
          Table 2presents post-event pharmacologic treatment of
          participants with HF and antihypertensive treatment of
          participants without HF. Following hospitalization for
          HF, 36% (83/232) of chlorthalidone participants and 45%
          (126/281) of doxazosin participants remained on their
          blinded medications. Percentages of participants on
          open-label diuretics and ACE-inhibitors were similar
          following the event: 58% (135/232) of chlorthalidone
          participants and 64% (180/281) of doxazosin participants
          were prescribed open-label diuretics; 39% (90/232) of
          chlorthalidone participants and 41% (114/281) of
          doxazosin participants were prescribed open-label
          ACE-inhibitors. Beta-blockers were prescribed for 14% of
          each group following the event, which was actually
          somewhat less than for participants who did not develop
          HF. Three-quarters of hospitalized HF participants in
          each group (169/232 in chlorthalidone group, 210/281 in
          doxazosin group) received at least one of the three
          medications (diuretic, ACE-inhibitor, or beta-blocker)
          post-hospitalization.
          Among participants treated but not hospitalized for
          HF, 58% (54/93) of the chlorthalidone group and 64%
          (93/145) of the doxazosin group remained on their blinded
          medication. Over 60% of participants in each group were
          prescribed open-label diuretics and over 30% received
          ACE-inhibitors. Open-label beta-blocker use post-event
          occurred in 19% (18/93) of the chlorthalidone group and
          22% (32/145) of the doxazosin group, approximately the
          same frequency as in participants without HF. In both
          treatment groups, a diuretic, ACE-inhibitor or
          beta-blocker was prescribed for over 75% of these
          participants (72/93 in chlorthalidone group, 119/145 in
          doxazosin group).
        
        
          Ejection Fraction Review
          Table 3displays the ejection fraction data. About half
          (178/361) of reviewed discharge summaries mentioned
          ejection fractions measured during hospitalization,
          two-thirds (116/169) of which had quantitative
          measurements reported in the discharge summaries (data
          not given). Considering only the earliest ejection
          fraction information ascertained for each HF participant,
          63% (29/46) of the chlorthalidone and 70% (41/59) of the
          doxazosin participants had ejection fractions at or below
          40%. Just under half (27/59) of the ejection fractions
          reported in the doxazosin group were at or below 30%,
          compared with one third (15/46) in the chlorthalidone
          group. Two-thirds of ejection fractions were obtained by
          echocardiograms, though catheterizations accounted for a
          larger percentage of results in the doxazosin group than
          in the chlorthalidone group (36% vs. 24%).
        
        
          Causes of Death and 2-Year Case-Fatality
          Causes of death of participants with previous HF
          hospitalization were distributed similarly in the two
          groups, with slight variations. HF accounted for 21.2%
          (11/52) of the deaths among chlorthalidone participants
          and 17.1% (12/70) of the deaths among doxazosin
          participants. Over half of the deaths in each group
          (29/52 in the chlorthalidone group; 43/70 in the
          doxazosin group) were due to cardiovascular events.
          Fifteen percent (8/52) of deaths in the chlorthalidone
          group were attributed to cancer, compared to 9% (6/70) in
          the doxazosin group (Table 4).
          Case-fatality for participants with hospitalized HF
          events showed no significant differences (RR 0.96, 95%
          CI, 0.67-1.38, 
          P = 0.83) between the two treatment
          groups (Figure 1). Among participants in the doxazosin
          treatment group who had been previously hospitalized for
          HF, 22.1% (70/317) subsequently died, compared to 18.6%
          (52/280) of those in the chlorthalidone group (Table 4).
          As previously reported, all-cause mortality did not
          significantly differ in the two treatment groups (RR
          1.03, 95% CI 0.90-1.15, 
          P = 0.56) [ 2 ] .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The finding of significantly increased HF events in the
        doxazosin group compared with the chlorthalidone group
        created a dilemma for ALLHAT. Since the trial was not
        designed to focus on HF, a component of a secondary
        endpoint, the validity of reported HF events became an
        issue. In this paper, we have described several analyses to
        address this concern.
        As previously reported, lost-to-follow-up and event
        documentation were similar in the two treatment groups [ 2
        ] . Steps employed to validate the HF outcome in these
        treatment groups confirmed the consistency of HF event
        reporting. Participants in the two drug groups had similar
        baseline characteristics when stratified by HF status. The
        differences in eligibility risk factors between those
        participants with HF and those without is not surprising:
        larger percentages of those with HF had a history of MI,
        stroke, CABG, angioplasty, other atherosclerotic
        cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), diabetes, low HDL levels
        and ECG abnormalities. Nonetheless, these eligibility
        factors were not substantially different between
        chlorthalidone and doxazosin participants with HF.
        Post-diagnosis pharmacologic management of patients is
        one measure of the strength of physicians' confidence in
        the HF diagnoses. Open-label diuretics, ACE-inhibitors and
        beta-blockers, all recognized treatments for HF, were
        prescribed similarly for the chlorthalidone and doxazosin
        groups, suggesting similar assessment of these events in
        the two treatment groups.
        ALLHAT criteria for HF were equivalently met in the two
        groups. While the sample (n = 50) of hospitalized or fatal
        HF reports reviewed by the ALLHAT Endpoints Subcommittee
        was limited in number and in adequacy of corroborating
        documentation, the review nonetheless showed adherence to
        study criteria for the majority (85%) of the event reports.
        The sometimes-discrepant results between reviewers
        pertained more often to incomplete data than to rejection
        of a HF diagnosis.
        Clinical use of more objective measures, including
        noninvasive and/or invasive tools for the measurement of
        left ventricular function, offers a means of establishing
        and quantifying systolic failure in cases clinically
        suggestive of HF [ 7 10 ] . Among the ejection fractions
        reported in the ALLHAT events that were reviewed, the
        majority fell at or below 40%, indicating some degree of
        systolic dysfunction. However, HF is a clinical diagnosis
        that does not necessarily exclude those with intact left
        ventricular systolic function [ 11 ] . Hypertension is a
        major risk factor for diastolic HF; as many as 25% of
        asymptomatic hypertensives with left ventricular
        hypertrophy have diastolic dysfunction. Additionally, 90%
        of patients with coronary artery disease may have some
        degree of diastolic dysfunction [ 12 ] .
        The two-fold increased relative risk of HF in the
        doxazosin group compared to the chlorthalidone group
        changed little when confined to hospitalized and fatal
        events. Further, HF patients in both the doxazosin and
        chlorthalidone treatment groups showed a rather high 20%
        case-fatality rate over two years, as expected in HF
        patients [ 11 13 14 ] , further supporting the validity of
        the diagnoses in the two groups. Among participants
        hospitalized for HF who subsequently died, over half of the
        deaths in each drug group were attributed to cardiovascular
        causes.
        Treatment group differences in mortality attributed to
        HF may take time to be recognized. Patients with HF are at
        risk for other competing causes of death. Accordingly, it
        may be too early to determine if a higher rate of HF in the
        doxazosin group translates into a higher overall mortality
        rate. A 20% 2-year case-fatality rate with a 4% difference
        in HF incidence rate translates into a 0.8% potential
        difference in total mortality without any competing causes
        of death. With competing causes, the difference would be
        smaller and difficult to detect even in a trial of ALLHAT's
        size.
        The diagnosis of HF is generally made on the basis of
        signs and symptoms that may overlap with those of other
        cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies. Moreover, the
        clinical picture may be further complicated for patients
        taking doxazosin, side effects of which (edema, dyspnea,
        and tachycardia) [ 15 ] may be misinterpreted as
        manifestations of HF.
        The capture of events in a "large and simple trial" such
        as ALLHAT has potential limitations. Built into a structure
        composed largely of community-based physicians is the
        assumption that their characterization of clinical events
        reflects diagnostic standards of the medical community,
        and, as such, meets study criteria. However, with its large
        number of endpoints, resources available to ALLHAT
        precluded more than modest confirmatory event
        documentation. Resources were allocated for additional
        documentation for quality control validation only for a
        sample of the primary endpoint (MIs and fatal CHD) and for
        strokes. While all reported events are reviewed at the CTC,
        the sometimes incomplete supporting details in
        documentation may not allow for validation of all events
        according to ALLHAT criteria. Some discharge summaries and
        death certificates may lack sufficient descriptive
        information needed to confirm the clinical diagnoses.
        Clinic staff are unable to provide corroborating
        documentation for 2% of ALLHAT event reports.
        Efforts to authenticate the HF events in the doxazosin
        and chlorthalidone treatment groups represented a desirable
        step in the examination of the increased rate of HR in the
        doxazosin group. All methods employed provided confirmatory
        evidence that both the HF diagnosis and the difference in
        HF rates noted between the doxazosin and chlorthalidone
        groups were valid. Results of this exploratory
        investigation support the event ascertainment methods
        developed for ALLHAT, specifically for HF events. This
        validation exercise further illustrates the ability of
        large, simple trials to answer important public health
        questions requiring large sample sizes and to grapple with
        unexpected results in a responsible and meaningful
        manner.
