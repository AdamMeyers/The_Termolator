        Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) family proteins
        are multifunctional cytokines capable of regulating cell
        growth, extracellular matrix protein synthesis, and immune
        cell functions [ 1 2 ] . Hyaluronidase is an extracellular
        matrix-degrading enzyme. Interestingly, malignant and
        metastatic breast and prostate cancer cells frequently
        overexpress both hyaluronidase and TGF-β proteins [ 3 4 5 6
        7 ] . Previously we have shown that bovine testicular
        hyaluronidase, also known as PH-20, increases the
        susceptibility of various cancer cells to tumor necrosis
        factor (TNF or TNF-α) cytotoxicity [ [ 8 ] , review]. PH-20
        induces the expression of proapoptotic p53 [ 9 ] and WOX1
        (WW domain-containing oxidoreductase; also known as WWOX or
        FOR) [ 10 ] , which contributes to the increased TNF
        cytotoxic effect. PH-20-induced downregulation of the
        extracellular matrix inter-α-inhibitor is also associated
        with the enhanced TNF cytotoxicity [ 9 ] .
        TGF-β family proteins, including β1,β2 and β3, induce
        TNF-resistance and suppress the PH-20 effect of increasing
        TNF cytotoxicity in murine L929 fibroblasts [ 8 11 ] .
        TGF-β1 induces a novel extracellular matrix protein that
        prevents TNF-mediated cell death and blocks the activation
        of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; also known
        as p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase, p42/44 MAPK) in
        L929 cells [ 8 12 ] . Additionally, TGF-β1 induces the
        expression of TIAF1 (TGF-β-induced antiapoptotic factor) [
        13 ] and TIF2 (TGF-β-induced factor 2) [ 14 ] that inhibit
        TNF cytotoxicity. Whether these TGF-β1-induced proteins
        restrict the ability of PH-20 to increase TNF cytotoxicity
        is unknown.
        PH-20 blocks TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression of
        epithelial cells [ 8 15 ] . Additionally, PH-20 rapidly
        activates ERK in L929 cells and TGF-β1 reduces the
        PH-20-induced ERK activation [ 16 ] . In contrast, TGF-β1
        synergistically increases PH-20-mediated inhibition of
        staurosporine apoptosis [ 16 ] . Thus, PH-20 and TGF-β1 are
        physiological antagonists for only certain cellular
        responses.
        Hyaluronidases Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 play a critical role in
        cancer invasion and metastasis [ 3 4 5 ] , although
        inactivation of 
        HYAL1 gene has been shown in head and
        neck squamous cell carcinomas [ 17 ] . Hyal-1, also known
        as Luca-1, is a lysosomal enzyme that is secreted from
        cells. Hyal-1 is a candidate tumor suppressor [ 5 18 ] ,
        although it enhances extravasation and metastasis of
        prostate cancer cells [ 3 ] . Also, mutations in Hyal-1 may
        contribute to the pathogenesis of a lysosomal disorder,
        mucopolysaccharidosis IX [ 19 ] . Hyal-2 is a lysosomal
        protein, which is active at low pH [ 20 ] . This protein is
        also known to be a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
        (GPI)-anchored cell-surface receptor for jaagsiekte sheep
        retrovirus [ 21 ] .
        Testicular hyaluronidase PH-20 counteracts
        TGF-β1-induced TNF-resistance in L929 cells [ 8 ] . The
        goal of the present study was to examine whether lysosomal
        Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 enhance TNF cytotoxic function and
        counteract TGF-β1-mediated TNF-resistance in L929 cells. It
        was determined that stable expression of murine Hyal-2 in
        L929 cells increased their sensitivity to TNF-mediated
        death, whereas Hyal-1 was somewhat less effective. TGF-β1
        blocked this increased sensitivity. In contrast, Hyal-1 and
        Hyal-2 did not enhance L929 cell death by anticancer drugs
        such as daunorubicin, actinomycin D, staurosporine and
        camptothecin. Overexpressed Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 induced the
        expression of proapoptotic WOX1, but not p53, suggesting a
        role of WOX1 in the increased cellular susceptibility to
        TNF cytotoxicity. Additional mechanisms that are associated
        with the increased TNF cytotoxicity were also
        investigated.
      
      
        Results
        As summarized in Figure 1, PH-20 induces the expression
        of proapoptotic p53 and WOX1 [ 9 10 ] and downregulates
        antiapoptotic matrix inter-α-inhibitor [ 9 ] , thereby
        enhancing TNF susceptibility in L929 cells. Also, PH-20
        rapidly activates ERK and c-Jun 
        N -terminal kinase (JNK1 and JNK2) [
        16 ] . Whether these signaling events lead to induction of
        p53 and WOX1 is unknown.
        In contrast, TGF-β1 protects L929 cells from TNF
        cytotoxicity by upregulating the expression of
        antiapoptotic TIAF1, TIF2 and a novel matrix protein [ 11
        12 13 14 ] . TGF-β1 blocks PH-20-increased TNF
        susceptibility [ 15 ] . Likewise, PH-20 inhibits
        TGF-β1-induced TNF-resistance [ 15 ] . TGF-β1 suppresses
        PH-20-mediated ERK activation [ 16 ] ; however, the ERK
        activation is not related with PH-20-increased TNF
        susceptibility in L929 cells [ 15 ] . Whether the
        proapoptotic p53 and WOX1 block the function of
        antiapoptotic TIAF1 and TIF2 is not known. In this study,
        experiments were designed to determine whether lysosomal
        Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 enhance TNF cytotoxic function and
        counteract TGF-β1-mediated TNF-resistance in L929
        cells.
        The full-length murine hyaluronidase 
        Hyal1 and 
        Hyal2 cDNAs were found in the EST
        database (GenBank accession AA688635 and BF139787,
        respectively) and the determined DNA sequences have been
        deposited in the GenBank ( 
        Hyal1 , AF422176; 
        Hyal2 , AF422177). The 
        Hyal1 cDNA encodes a 463-amino-acid
        protein, which has 99.1% identity to a reported murine
        sequence (AF011567) [ 18 ] . Differences in the protein
        sequences are Gly-247, Gly-284 and Cys-450 in our Hyal-1
        protein, compared to Arg-247, Glu-284 and Arg-450 in
        AF011567. Transitions in these amino acid residues are
        non-conservative.
        The murine 
        Hyal2 cDNA (AF422177) encodes a
        473-amino-acid protein. The deduced protein sequence is
        identical to a reported murine sequence (AF302844), but has
        an Ile-355 to Val-355 transition compared to another clone
        (AF302843). Variation in the protein sequence is also found
        in a murine Hyal-2 homologue (NP_034619) [ 22 ] , which
        possesses three unique 2-, 5- and 7-amino-acid segments,
        not identical to the above Hyal-2 proteins.
        L929 cells were engineered to stably express GFP-Hyal-1
        or GFP-Hyal-2 fusion proteins. The presence of these
        proteins in these cells was demonstrated in Western
        blotting using anti-GFP antibody (data not shown).
        Exogenous bovine testicular hyaluronidase PH-20 stimulates
        rapid activation of c-Jun 
        N -terminal kinases (JNK1 and JNK2)
        in L929 cells [ 16 ] . In contrast, the stably expressed
        Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 could not mediate constitutive activation
        of JNK1 and JNK2 in L929 cells (data not shown).
        Exposure of the Hyal-2-expressing L929 cells to TNF for
        16-24 hr resulted in increased cell death by ~60-110%,
        compared to the control GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 2).
        These results are similar to the bovine testicular
        PH-20-increased TNF cytotoxicity of L929 cells [ 15 ] . In
        contrast, there were no significant differences in the
        extent of cell death when GFP-Hyal-2 and control
        GFP-expressing cells were exposed to staurosporine,
        actinomycin D, daunorubicin, or camptothecin for 16-24 hr
        (Fig. 2).
        There was also an increased susceptibility to TNF
        cytotoxicity in the Hyal-1-expressing L929 cells
        (approximately 20-90% increase; also see Fig. 7), compared
        to the GFP control cells. However, there were no
        significant differences among these cells in the extent of
        death caused by staurosporine, actinomycin D, daunorubicin
        and camptothecin (data not shown).
        In similar experiments, the effect of transient
        expression of Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 on cellular sensitivity to
        anticancer drugs was examined. L929 cells were
        electroporated with the GFP-Hyal-1 or GFP-Hyal-2 construct,
        cultured for 48 hr and then exposed to actinomycin D,
        daunorubicin or camptothecin for 24 hr. There were no
        differences in cell death in these Hyal-1 and
        Hyal-2-expressing cells, compared to control cells (data
        not shown). These findings are consistent with the results
        for stable transfectants presented above (Fig. 2).
        Bovine testicular PH-20 enhances TNF sensitivity in L929
        cells by increasing the expression of proapoptotic p53 and
        WOX1 [ 9 10 ] . The ability of Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 to induce
        the expression of p53 and WOX1 in L929 cells was examined.
        L929 cells were electroporated with nothing (null), GFP,
        GFP-Hyal-1 or GFP-Hyal-2 constructs and cultured for 48 hr.
        Transient expression of GFP-Hyal-1 or GFP-Hyal-2 in L929
        cells induced WOX1 expression, whereas no WOX1 expression
        was observed in non-transfected cells or control
        GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 3A). The 46-kDa band is
        full-length WOX1, while the 31-kDa band is a degraded WOX1
        [ 10 ] . No detectable p53 expression was observed in these
        cells (Fig. 3A).
        In comparison, the cytosolic WOX1 (46 kDa) was
        constitutively expressed in the L929 cells stably
        transfected with the GFP-Hyal-2 construct, while TNF
        reduced WOX1 expression in a time-dependent manner (Fig.
        3B). This reduction is probably due to TNF-mediated WOX1
        nuclear translocation from the mitochondria [ 10 ] . In
        contrast, WOX1 was not expressed in L929 cells stably
        transfected with the GFP-Hyal-1 construct, and TNF induced
        WOX1 expression in 40 min (Fig. 3B). TNF did not induce
        WOX1 expression in the control GFP-expressing cells (Fig.
        3B).
        Whether Hyal-2 enhances the apoptosis-inducing function
        of WOX1 was determined. In transient transfection
        experiments, L929 cells were electroporated with GFP-Hyal-2
        and/or WOX1 constructs. GFP-Hyal-2 enhanced WOX1-mediated
        L929 cell death, as determined 48 hr post-transfection
        using crystal violet staining (Fig. 3C). In contrast,
        GFP-Hyal-1 did not enhance WOX1-mediated cell death (Fig.
        3C). GFP-Hyal-1 and GFP-Hyal-2 alone did not mediate cell
        death (Fig. 3C).
        Next, the effect of TNF-mediated IκBα degradation and
        NF-κB activation was examined in both Hyal-1 and Hyal-2
        cells. The GFP-Hyal-1 and GFP-Hyal-2 stable transfectants
        and control cells were exposed to TNF for various times.
        IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation (or NF-κB nuclear
        translocation) were observed at 20 to 60 min in Hyal-2
        cells post TNF stimulation, but at the 20 min time point in
        both control and Hyal-1 cells (Fig. 4).
        To further understand how Hyal-2 participates in the
        apoptosis pathway, the translocation of Hyal-2 to the
        mitochondria was examined during cell death. Transient
        expression of GFP-Hyal-2 in COS7 fibroblasts showed the
        localization of the expressed protein in the lysosome but
        not in the mitochondria, as determined by staining the
        cells using LysoTracker and Mitotracker Red (data not
        shown). These observations are consistent with other
        reports [ 5 20 ] . COS7 cells are TNF-resistant. The
        reasons for using this cell type are its large size (which
        provides better resolution under fluorescence microscopy)
        and the ease of transfection and gene expression using
        liposome-based reagents such as FuGene 6 and GeneFector.
        Exposure of the GFP-Hyal-2-expressing COS7 cells to
        staurosporine (for inducing apoptosis) resulted in a
        time-related increase in co-localization of GFP-Hyal-2 with
        the mitochondria (Fig. 5), suggesting that a portion of
        GFP-Hyal-2 migrates to the mitochondria during
        apoptosis.
        Next, whether TGF-β1 antagonizes the function of Hyal-1
        and Hyal-2 in growth regulation was examined. TGF-β1
        inhibits epithelial cell growth but promotes fibroblast
        growth [ 15 ] . TGF-β1 inhibition of epithelial cell growth
        is blocked by bovine testicular PH-20 [ 15 ] . In agreement
        with our previous observations [ 11 ] , TGF-β1 promoted
        L929 cell growth by approximately 20% in 24-48 hr (Fig. 6).
        However, TGF-β1 did not promote the growth of L929 cells
        stably expressing Hyal-1 or Hyal-2 (Fig. 6).
        Finally, the functional antagonism between TGF-β1 and
        Hyal-1 or Hyal-2 in regulating TNF susceptibility in L929
        cells was examined. The Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 stable
        transfectants were pretreated with TGF-β1 for 1 hr and then
        treated with TNF overnight. Both Hyal-1- and
        Hyal-2-increased TNF cytotoxicity were suppressed by TGF-β1
        (30-50%) (Fig. 7). However, TGF-β1 blocked TNF cytotoxicity
        of the GFP-expressing control cells to a greater extent
        (50-70%) (Fig. 7).
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study, the novel function of the lysosomal
        hyaluronidases Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 in increasing cellular
        sensitivity to TNF cytotoxicity is reported. TGF-β1
        counteracted Hyal-1- and Hyal-2-increased TNF killing of
        L929 fibroblasts. TGF-β1 increased L929 growth, while
        Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 blocked this enhancement of cell growth.
        These observations are consistent with our previous finding
        that exogenous bovine testicular hyaluronidase PH-20
        enhances TNF cytotoxicity in various cancer cells, and that
        TGF-β1 blocks the increased TNF cytotoxicity [ 8 15 ] . As
        summarized in the Figure 8, the underlying mechanisms
        whereby Hyal-2 induces TNF cytotoxicity appear to be
        associated with 1) Hyal-2 induction of the proapoptotic
        WOX1, 2) Hyal-2 migration to the mitochondria during
        apoptosis, and 3) the prolonged period of IκBα degradation
        and NF-κB activation in TNF-treated Hyal-2-expressing
        cells.
        Upregulation of p53 and WOX1 contributes, in part, to
        the PH-20-enhanced cytotoxic function of TNF [ 9 10 23 ] .
        WOX1 is a p53-binding protein. Ectopic expression of both
        p53 and WOX1 cDNA constructs results in colocalization of
        these proteins in the mitochondria [ 23 ] . Increased
        synthesis and complex formation between p53 and WOX1 in the
        cytoplasm are observed during apoptosis [ 23 ] . Both p53
        and WOX1 mediate apoptosis synergistically. Overexpressed
        WOX1 alone mediates apoptosis independently of p53 [ 10 ] .
        However, p53 apoptosis requires the participation of WOX1.
        Blocking WOX1 expression with antisense mRNA abolishes
        p53-mediated cell death, suggesting that WOX1 is a
        potential partner of p53 in apoptosis [ 10 23 ] .
        Both Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 induced WOX1 expression when
        transiently expressed in L929 cells. However, only Hyal-2
        induced WOX1 expression following stable transfection of
        L929 cells. This correlates with the greater extent of
        Hyal-2 enhancement of TNF killing compared to Hyal-1. WOX1
        expression was induced by TNF in the Hyal-1 stable
        transfectant. In transient transfection experiments, Hyal-2
        enhanced WOX1-mediated L929 cell death, while Hyal-1 had no
        effect. Both Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 alone failed to induce cell
        death. Thus, induction of WOX1 expression contributes, in
        part, to Hyal-1- and Hyal-2-increased TNF sensitivity in
        L929 cells.
        TNF rapidly induces phosphorylation of IκBα, which
        normally peaks at 5-10 min, followed by
        proteasome-dependent degradation (10-20 min) [ 10 24 ] .
        IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation occurred, as
        determined 20 min after exposure of control and Hyal-1
        cells to TNF. However, there was an extended period of
        TNF-mediated IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation in
        Hyal-2 cells, ranging from 20-60 min. It is unclear whether
        this extend ed period of IκBα degradation and NF-κB
        activation directly contributes to the ability of Hyal-2 to
        enhance TNF-mediated apoptosis. IκBα is a physiological
        inhibitor of NF-κB activation; IκBα complexes with NF-κB
        and prevents its translocation to the nucleus [ 10 24 ] .
        NF-κB activation is believed to induce antiapoptotic
        proteins to block cell death [ 8 ] . However, in several
        studies activated NF-κB cannot protect cells from apoptosis
        [ 8 ] . Also, NF-κB appears to be essential in the
        p53-mediated apoptosis in tested cell lines [ 25 ] .
        The mitochondrion is a reservoir of proapoptotic
        proteins and plays a key role in apoptosis [ [ 26 27 ] ;
        reviews]. One of the pathways that leads to the release of
        proapoptotic proteins in the mitochondria has been
        determined. For example, the TNF/TNF receptor-signaling
        complex activates caspase 8, which leads to the activation
        and cleavage of Bid, a proapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2
        family. Activated or truncated Bid (tBid) in turn activates
        Bak and Bax. Bak migrates to the mitochondrial outer
        membrane where it generates transmembrane pores; Bax
        induces the opening of the mitochondrial permeability
        transition pores. Cytochrome c is then released from the
        mitochondria into the cytosol, where it interacts with
        downstream proapoptotic proteins such as Apaf-1 and caspase
        9. Activation of these proteins further activates
        nucleases, such as caspase-activated DNase (CAD), which
        cause DNA fragmentation.
        During staurosporine-mediated apoptosis, a portion of
        the lysosomal Hyal-2 migrates to the mitochondria. Whether
        Hyal-2 causes mitochondrial membrane damage is unknown.
        Presumably, Hyal-2 interacts with a specific protein target
        on the mitochondrial surface that changes the membrane
        permeability. This notion is supported by our recent
        screening of Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 interacting proteins in
        yeast two-hybrid interactions (Chang 
        et al , unpublished)
        The functional property of Hyal-2 in degrading
        hyaluronic acid is controversial. Hyal-2 is found in the
        lysosome and is active under conditions of low pH [ 20 ] .
        Hyal-2 is also found on the cell surface as a
        glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptor for
        jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus [ 21 ] . Nonetheless, the
        enzymatic activity of Hyal-2 has not been detected [ 21 ] .
        Whether the increased TNF cytotoxicity in L929 cells caused
        by Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 is associated with their enzymatic
        activities is being studied in this laboratory.
        The TGF-β1 inhibition of Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 effects could
        be abolished by cycloheximide or actinomycin D (data not
        shown). That is, inhibition of protein synthesis or gene
        transcription reduced the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 in
        the prevention of Hyal-1- or Hyal-2-increased TNF
        cytotoxicity. Whether TGF-β1-induced antiapoptotic proteins
        such as TIAF1 and TIF2 inhibit the function of Hyal-1 and
        Hyal-2 remains to be determined.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Like testicular PH-20, lysosomal Hyal-1 and Hyal-2
        enhanced TNF susceptibility in L929 cells. TGF-β1
        suppressed the induced TNF sensitivity. Furthermore,
        TGF-β1-mediated L929 cell proliferation was blocked by
        Hyal-1 and Hyal-2. These data indicate that there is a
        functional antagonism between TGF-β1 and Hyal-1 or Hyal-2.
        Hyal-2-increased TNF susceptibility in L929 cells appears
        to be associated with 1) Hyal-2 upregulation of the
        proapoptotic WOX1, 2) Hyal-2 migration to the mitochondria
        during apoptotic cell death, and 3) the prolonged IκBα
        degradation and NF-κB activation in Hyal-2-expressing cells
        stimulated with TNF.

          cDNA constructs, transient expression and stable
          transfectants
          The full-length murine hyaluronidase 
          Hyal1 and 
          Hyal2 cDNAs were found in the EST
          database (Genbank accession AA688635 and BF139787,
          respectively) and purchased from Incyte Genomics (St.
          Louis, MO). The determined DNA sequences have been
          deposited in the GenBank ( 
          Hyal1 , AF422176; 
          Hyal2 , AF422177). The coding
          regions were tagged with a 
          C -terminal green fluorescent
          protein (GFP) sequence by subcloning into the 
          EcoR 1 site of the pEGFP-N1 vector
          (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Murine L929 cells were
          transfected with the constructed Hyal-1-pEGFP-N1 or
          Hyal-2-pEGFP-N1 vector, or a control pEGFP-N1 vector by
          electroporation (40 μg DNA/ 5 × 10 6cells; 250 volt and
          960 Fd), as previously described [ 10 ] . The cells were
          cultured in the continuous presence of G418 (200 g/ml)
          for approximately 2 weeks, and the resulting total cell
          colonies were harvested. The presence of GFP-Hyal-1 and
          GFP-Hyal-2 proteins in these stable transfectants was
          examined by Western blotting using anti-GFP antibodies
          (Clontech). Where indicated, COS7 fibroblasts were
          transfected with the above constructs using a
          liposome-based reagent FuGene 6 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN)
          or GeneFector (Venn Nova, Pompano Beach, FL). Protein
          expression was visualized by fluorescence microscopy.
          Also, the cells were counterstained with LysoTracker or
          Mitotracker Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to
          determine whether the expressed protein was located in
          the lysosome or mitochondria.
        
        
          Cell lines and chemicals
          Murine L929 fibroblasts and monkey kidney COS7
          fibroblasts were cultured as previously described [ 10 ]
          . Staurosporine, daunorubicin, actinomycin D,
          camptothecin and DAPI were from Calbiochem (San Diego,
          CA), Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and Biomol (Plymouth Meeting,
          PA). Purified human platelet TGF-β1 was from R&D
          (Minneapolis, MN). Antisera against WOX1 were generated
          in rabbits against a synthetic peptide [ 10 ] .
          Antibodies against p53, IκBα, NF-κB p65 and α-tubulin
          were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and
          Accurate Chemicals (Accurate Chemical, Westbury, NY).
        
        
          TNF cytotoxicity assay and Western blotting
          The above established cell lines were treated with
          TNF-α (2.5-20 ng/ml; Pepro-Tech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for
          16-24 hr. The extent of cell death was determined by
          crystal violet staining [ 10 ] . Where indicated, the
          cells were also exposed to staurosporine, actinomycin D,
          daunorubicin, and camptothecin for 16-24 hr, before
          determining the extent of cell death. To determine
          whether TGF-β1 blocked Hyal-1 and Hyal-2-increased TNF
          killing, the cells were pretreated with TGF-β1 for 2 hr
          and then exposed to TNF-α in the continued presence of
          TGF-β1 for 16-24 hr. The extent of cell death was then
          determined. Where indicated, GFP-Hyal-1, GFP-Hyal-2 and
          GFP stable transfectants were treated with TNF (50 ng/ml)
          for 0, 20, 40, 60 and 120 minutes. The cells were
          extracted using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction
          Reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL) to separate the
          cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. These preparations
          were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using
          specific antibodies against IκBα, WOX1 and NF-κB.
        
        
          Gene transfection and fluorescent microscopy
          COS7 cells were transfected with the GFP-Hyal-2 vector
          using the liposome-based FuGene 6 or GeneFector, cultured
          for 24-48 hr, and treated with staurosporine (1 M) for 0,
          1, 2 and 4 hr. Mitochondria were stained with the
          membrane potential sensitive Mitotracker Red. Nuclei were
          stained by DAPI. The cells were then examined by
          fluorescence microscopy.
