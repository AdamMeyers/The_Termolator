        For over a decade the idea of representing biological
        sequences in a continuous coordinate space has maintained
        its appeal but not been fully realized [ 1 2 3 ] . The
        basic idea is that sequences of symbols, such as
        nucleotides in genomes, aminoacids in proteomes, repeated
        sequences in MLST [Multi Locus Sequence Typing, 4], words
        in languages or letters in words, would define trajectories
        in this continuous space conserving the statistical
        properties of the original sequences [ 3 5 6 7 8 9 ] .
        Accordingly, the coordinate position of each unit would
        uniquely encode for both its identity and its context, i.e.
        the identity of its neighbors [ 10 ] . Ideally, the
        position should be scale-independent, such that the
        extraction of the encompassing sequence can be performed
        with any resolution, leading to an oligomer of arbitrary
        length. The pioneer work by Jeffrey published in 1990 [ 5 ]
        achieved this for genomic sequences by using the Chaos Game
        Representation technique (CGR), defining a unit-square
        where each corner corresponds to one of the 4 possible
        nucleotides. Subsequent work further explored the
        properties of CGR of biological sequences, but two main
        obstacles prevented the realization of its early promise -
        lack of scalability with regard to the number of possible
        unique units and inability to represent succession schemes.
        Meanwhile, Markov Chain theory already offered a solid
        foundation for the identification of discrete spaces to
        represent sequences as cross-tabulated conditional
        probabilities - Markov transition tables. This Bayesian
        technique is widely explored in bioinformatic applications
        seeking to measure homology and align sequences [ 11 ] . In
        a recent report [ 12 ] we have shown that, for genomic
        sequences, Markov tables are in fact a special case of CGR,
        contrary to what had been suggested previously [ 13 ] .
        This raised the prospect of an advantageous use of
        iterative maps as state spaces not only for representation
        of sequences but also to identify scale independent
        stochastic models of the succession scheme. That work [ 12
        ] is hereby extended and further generalized to be
        applicable to sequences with arbitrary numbers of unique
        component units, without sacrificing the inverse
        correlation between distance in the map and sequence
        similarity independent of position. Accordingly, the
        technique is named Universal Sequence Map (USM).
      
      
        Results
        
          Conceptual foundations
          The USM generalization proposed here is achieved by
          observing two stipulations: A-alternative units in the
          iterative map are positioned in distinct corners of 
          unit block structures', and B -
          sequence processing is bi-directional.
          Basis for USM generalization:
          A. Each unique unit is referenced in the map for
          positions that are at equal 
          n-distances from each other, and
          possibly, but not necessarily, defining a complete 
          block structure [ 3 ] . 
          n-distances are defined as the
          maximum distance along any dimension, e.g. 
          n-distance between [ 
          a 
          1 , 
          a 
          2 , ..., 
          a 
          
            n 
           ] and [ 
          b 
          1 , 
          b 
          2 , ..., 
          b 
          
            n 
           ] is 
          max(|b 
          1 - 
          a 
          1 |, | 
          b 
          2 - 
          a 
          2 |, ..., | 
          b 
          
            n 
           - 
          a 
          
            n 
           |), see also Equation 3. It will be shown that this
          stipulation leads to the definition of spaces where
          distance is inversely proportional to sequence
          similarity, independent of position. In this respect, USM
          departs from previous attempts to generalize Chaos Game
          Representation that conserve the bi-dimensionality of the
          original CGR representation [ 8 15 16 17 ] .
          B. The iterative positioning is performed in both
          directions. Therefore, there will be two sets of
          coordinates, the result of forward and backward iterative
          operations. It will be shown that, by adding backward and
          forward map distances between two positions, the number
          of identical units in the encompassing sequences can be
          extracted directly from the USM coordinates. As a
          consequence, two arbitrary positions can be compared, and
          the number of contiguous similar units is extracted by an
          algebraic operation that relies solely on the USM
          coordinates of those very two positions.
        
        
          Implementation of USM algorithm
          The algorithm will be first illustrated for the first
          and last stanzas of Wendy Cope's poem "The Uncertainty of
          the Poet" (14), respectively, "I am a poet. I am very
          fond of bananas." and "I am of very fond bananas. Am I a
          poet?". The procedure includes four steps:
          1. Identification of unique sequence units - e.g.
          these two stanzas have 19 unique characters, (table 1),
          i.e. 
          uu = 19. 
          2. Replacement of each unique unit (in this case units
          are alphabetic characters) by a unique binary number -
          e.g. in table 1each of the 19 unique units is replaced by
          its rank order minus one, represented as a binary number.
          Other arrangements are possible leading to the same final
          result as discussed below. The minimum number of
          dimensions necessary to accommodate 
          uu unique units, 
          n, is the upper integer of the
          length of its binary representation: 
          n = ceil(log 
          2 
          (uu)). For W. Cope's stanzas, 
          n = ceil(log 
          2 
          (19)) = 5. The binary reference
          coordinates for the unique units are defined by the
          numerals of the binary code - for example, 
          a will be assigned to the position 
          U 
          ' 
          a ' = 
          [0,0,1,0,1]. Each symbol is
          represented as a corner in a n-dimensional cube (Table
          1). The purpose of these first two steps is to guarantee
          that the reference positions for each unique sequence
          unit component are equidistant (stipulation A) in the 
          n-metric defined above. Any other
          procedure resulting in equidistant unique positions will
          lead to the same final results independently of the
          actual binary numbers used or the number of dimensions
          used to contain them.
          3. The CGR procedure [ 5 ] (Eq. 1) is applied
          independently to each coordinate, 
          j = 1,2, ...,n, for each unit, 
          i, in the sequence of length 
          k, u 
          
            j 
           
          (i) with 
          i = 1,2, ...,k, and starting with a
          random map position taken from a uniform distribution in
          [0,1] 
          n , i.e. 
          Unif([0,1] 
          n ). The random seed is not
          fundamentally different from using the middle position in
          the map as is conventional in CGR and it has the added
          feature that it prevents the invalidation of the inverse
          logarithmic proportionality of 
          n-distance to sequence similarity [
          12 ] for sequences that start or end with the same
          motif.
          For a sequence with 
          k units, the USM positions 
          i = 1,..., k for the 
          j = 1,..., n dimensions are
          determined as follows:
          
          4. The previous step generated 
          k positions in a 
          n -dimension space by processing
          the sequence forward (Eq. 1). This subsequent step adds
          an additional set of 
          n dimensions by implementing the
          same procedure backward (Eq. 2), again starting at random
          positions for each coordinate. Consequently the first 
          n dimensions of USM will be
          referred as defining 
          a forward map and the second set of
          
          n dimensions will define a 
          backward map. Put together, the
          bidirectional USM map defines a 
          2n-unit block structure. 
          The 
          n additional backward coordinates
          are determined as follows:
          
          The forward USM map for genomic sequences, where 
          uu = 4, and, consequently, 
          n = 2, is the same as the result
          generated by CGR. However, by freeing the iterative map
          from the dual-dimensional constraint of conventional CGR,
          the USM forward map alone achieved the goal of producing
          a scale independent representation of sequences of
          arbitrary number of unique units. These properties will
          be briefly illustrated with W Cope's example. The 16
          thunit of the first stanza, "I am a poet. I am very fond
          of bananas.", has USM coordinates 
          USM 
          
            [1,...,2n] 
           
          (16) = 
          [0.02 0.01 0.63 0.00 0.53 0.07 0.30
          0.52 0.27 0.57]. The first 
          n = 5 coordinates, the position in
          the forward map, can now be used, by reversing equation 1
          [ 12 13 ] , not only to extract the identity the unit 
          i = 16 but also the identity of the
          preceding units:
          - using forward coordinates alone 
          [0.0156 0.0138 0.6314 0.0001
          0.5338] 
          
          The same procedure can be applied to the remaining 
          n = 5 coordinates, the position in
          the backward map, to extract the identity of the
          succeeding units, now ordered backwards.
          - using backward coordinates alone 
          [0.0703 0.3004 0.5169 0.2742
          0.5652] 
          
          The length of the sequence that can be recovered from
          a position in the CGR or USM space is only as long as the
          resolution, in bits, of the coordinates themselves. In
          addition, the relevance of these iterative techniques is
          not associated with the property of recovering sequences
          as much as with the ability to recover the succession
          schemes, e.g. the Markov probability tables. It has been
          recognized for almost a decade that the density of
          positions in unidirectional, bi-dimensional, iterated CGR
          maps (e.g. of genomic sequences, 
          uu = 4 -> 
          n = 2 ) defines a Markov table [ 12
          13 ] . The complete accommodation of Markov chains in
          unidirectional USM (i.e. either forward or backward,
          which is an equivalent to a multidimensional solution for
          CGR) can be quickly established by noting that the
          identity of a quadrant is set by its middle coordinates [
          13 ] . In order to extract the Markov format, for an
          arbitrary integer order 
          ord, each of the two n-unit
          hypercubes, the set of 
          n forward or backward coordinates,
          would be divided in 
          q = 2 
          n.(ord+1) equal quadrants and the
          quadrant frequencies rearranged [ 12 ] . The use of 
          quadrant to designate what is in
          fact a sub-unit hypercube is a consonance with the
          preceding work on bidimensional CGR maps [ 12 ] , where
          it was shown that since any number of subdivisions can be
          considered in a continuous domain, the density
          distribution becomes an order-free Markov Table that
          accommodates both integer and fractal memory lengths. The
          extraction of Markov chain transition tables from USM
          representations, both forward and backward, is included
          in the accompanying web-based application (see
          Abstract).
          Above, the USM procedure was shown to allow for the
          representation of sequences as multidimensional objects
          without loss of identity or context. These objects can
          now be analyzed to characterize the sequences for
          quantities such as similarity between segments or entropy
          [ 18 19 ] within the sequence. In figure 1the
          10-dimensional object defined by the USM positions of the
          two stanzas was projected in 3-dimensions by principal
          component analysis. The dimensionality reduction by
          principal factor extraction has visualization purposes
          only. As established above, the minimum necessary
          dimensionality of the USM state space is set by the
          binary logarithm of the number of unique units.
          Nevertheless, the sequence variance associated with each
          component is provided in the figure legend. In figure 1a,
          the segments " 
          very fond of" in the two stanzas
          are linked by solid lines to highlight the fact that
          sequence similarity is reflected by spatial proximity of
          USM coordinates. The representation is repeated in Figure
          1bwith solid lining of the segment " 
          bananas ". The matching of the two
          segments of the second stanza (light) to the similar
          segments of the first stanza (dark) is, again, visually
          apparent.
          The USM algorithm determines that similar sequences,
          or segments of sequences, will have converging iterated
          trajectories: the distance will be cut in half for every
          consecutive similar unit. This property was notice before
          for CGR of genomic sequences [ 12 ] , and will be further
          explored here for USM generalization. In that preceding
          work it was shown that the number of similar consecutive
          units can be approximated by a symmetrical logarithmic
          transformation of the maximum distance between two
          positions in either of the dimensions ( 
          n-distance ), 
          d. 
          
          d = -log 
          2 (Max|Δ 
          USM 
          
            undirectional 
           |)     (Eq. 3)
          Since the USM coordinates include two CGR iterations
          per dimension, one forward and another backward, two
          distances can be extracted. The first 1,..., 
          n coordinates define a forward
          similarity estimate, 
          d 
          
            f 
           , and the second 
          n+1,..., 2n coordinates can be used
          to estimate backward similarity, 
          d 
          
            b 
           . The former measures similarity with regard to the
          units preceding the one being compared and the latter
          does the same for those the succeeding that same units.
          Therefore, the forward and backward distances between the
          positions 
          i and 
          j of two sequences, 
          a and 
          b, with a length of 
          k 
          
            a 
           and 
          k 
          
            b 
           , respectively, would be calculated as described by
          equation 4, defining two rectangular matrices, 
          d 
          
            f 
           and 
          d 
          
            b 
           , of size 
          k 
          
            a 
           × 
          k 
          
            b 
           (Fig. 2a,2b).
          
          However, the values of d necessarily overestimate the
          number of similar contiguous units preceding ( 
          d 
          
            f 
           , illustration for stanza comparison in Fig. 2a) or
          succeeding ( 
          d 
          
            b 
           , illustration for stanza comparison in Fig. 2b) the
          positions being compared. The value of 
          d would be the exact number of
          contiguous similar units, 
          h, if the starting positions for
          the similar segments where at a 
          n-distance of 1, e.g. if they were
          in different corners of the unit hyper-dimensional USM
          cube. Since the initial distance is always somewhat
          smaller, the homology, 
          h, measured as the number of
          consecutive similar units, will be smaller than 
          d (Eq. 5).
          
          The contribution of φ to the similarity distance, 
          d, can be estimated from the
          distribution of positions in the USM map of a random
          sequence. A uniformly random sequence [ 3 19 20 ] will
          occupy the USM space uniformly, and, for that matter, so
          will the random seed of forward and backward iterative
          mapping, respectively equations 1 and 2. Therefore, a
          uniform distribution is an appropriated starting point to
          estimate the effect of ( 
          p, the over-determination of 
          h by 
          d (Eq.5). Accordingly, for a given 
          x∈ [0,1], the probability, 
          P 
          
            o 
           , that any two coordinates, 
          x 
          1 and 
          x 
          2 , are located within a radius 
          r ∈ (0,1) is given by Equation
          6.
          
          Since 
          P 
          
            o 
           ( 
          r ) is the probability of two
          points chosen randomly from a uniform distribution 
          Unif([0,1]) being at a distance
          less than 
          r from each other, for any set of 
          n coordinates in the USM, the
          likelihood of finding another position within a block
          distance of 
          r would be described by raising
          equation 6 to the 
          n exponent. Finally, recalling from
          equation 3 that sequence similarity can be obtained by a
          logarithmic transformation of r, the probability that the
          unidirectional coordinates of two random sequences are at
          a similar length 
          d > φ is described by equation
          7. The simplicity of the expansion for higher dimensions
          highlights the order-statistics properties [ 21 ] of the 
          n-metric introduced above (Eq. 3).
          It is noteworthy that the model for the likelihood of
          over-determination is the null-model, e.g. the comparison
          of actual sequences is evaluated against the hypothesis
          that the similarity observed happened by chance
          alone.
          
          Finally, it is also relevant to recall that the null
          model for 
          d (Eq.7 for unidirectional
          comparisons, bi-directional null models are derived
          below) allows the generalization for non-integer
          dimensions. For example, the 19 unique unites found in
          the two stanzas (Table 1), define forward and backward
          USM maps in 5 dimensions each. However the 5 thdimension
          is not fully utilized, as that would require 
          2 5= 
          32 unique units. Therefore, if
          there is no requirement for an integer result, the
          effective value of 
          n for the two stanzas can be
          refined as being 
          n = log 
          2 
          (19) = 4.25. 
          An estimation of bi-directional similarity will now be
          introduced that adds the forward and backward distance
          measures 
          d 
          
            f 
           and 
          d 
          
            b 
           . The motivation for this new estimate is the the
          determination of the similar length of the entire similar
          segment between two sequences solely by comparing any two
          homologous units. Accordingly, since 
          d 
          
            f 
           is an estimate of preceding similarity and 
          d 
          
            b 
           provides the succeeding similarity equivalent the
          sum of the two similar distances, 
          D, (Eq. 8) will estimate of the
          bi-directional similarity, e.g. the length of the similar
          segment, 
          H. 
          
          As illustrated later in the implementation, for
          pairwise comparisons of homologous units of similar
          segments, all values of 
          D and, consequently, of φ, are
          exactly the same. This result could possibly have been
          anticipated from the preceding work [ 12 ] by noting that
          the value of 
          d between two adjacent homologous
          units differs exactly by one unit. However, this result
          was in fact a surprise and one with far reaching
          fundamental and practical implications.
          Similarly to unidirectional similarity estimation, 
          d, the bi-directional estimate, 
          D, being the sum of two
          overestimates, is also overestimated by a quantity to be
          defined, φ (Eq. 8). The derivation of an expression for
          the bi-directional overestimation will require the
          decomposition of 
          P 
          1 (Eq. 7) for two cases, comparison
          between unidirectional coordinates of similar quadrants, 
          P 
          1 
          a  , and of opposite quadrants,
          
          P 
          1 
          b  , as described in equation
          9. Recalling from equation 2, positions in the same
          quadrant correspond to sequence units with the same
          identity, and positions in opposite quadrants correspond
          to comparison between coordinates of units with a
          different identity.
          
          The need for the distinction between same and opposite
          quadrant comparison, which is to say between similar and
          between dissimilar sequence units, is caused by the fact
          that same quadrant comparisons are more likely to lead to
          higher values of 
          d. As illustrated above for the 16
          thunit of the first stanza, the forward and backward
          coordinates must fall in the same quadrant. Consequently,
          the similar pattern of same and opposite quadrant
          comparisons for each dimension will be reflected as a
          bias in the bi-directional overestimation. The
          determination of probability, 
          P 
          2 , of over-determination between sums
          of independent unidirectional similarity estimates is
          derived in equation 10.
          
          The probability of bi-directional over-determination,
          can now be established by using the same and opposite
          unidirectional comparison expressions presented in
          Equation 9. The resulting expression for similarity
          over-determination by the distance between bidirectional
          USM coordinates, 
          P 
          3 , is presented in equation 11.
          
          In figure 3, the probability distribution for both
          unidirectional ( 
          P 
          1 , in gray) and bidirectional ( 
          P 
          3 , in black) comparisons is
          represented for different dimensions, 
          n. It is clearly apparent that the
          over-determination becomes much less significant as
          dimensionality increases. From a practical point of view,
          the over-determination is of little consequence because
          the computational load of comparing sequences corresponds
          mostly to the identification of candidate pairing
          combinations. The fact that the n-metric unidirectional
          distances, 
          d 
          
            f 
           and 
          d 
          
            b 
           , defined in Equation 4, and bidirectional 
          D, defined in Eq. 8, are
          over-determined implies that the identification of
          similar segments between two sequences will include false
          positives but will not generate false negatives. The
          false positive identifications can be readily recognized
          by comparing the sequences extracted from the
          coordinates, as demonstrated above for the 16 thunit of
          the first stanza. Nevertheless, since over-determination
          will necessarily occur, its probability distribution was
          identified (Eq. 11, Fig. 3). This can also be achieved
          for individual values by solving Eq. 11 for the value of
          φ observed. For example, for the conditions of the two
          stanzas, the value of (φ 
          
          p 1 = 0.5, 
          n = 4.25 is 0.71 sequence units,
          which is the expected median unidirectional
          over-determination, 
          P 
          1 , of 
          d 
          
            f 
           and 
          d 
          
            b 
           (Eqs. 5, 7). The corresponding probability of
          bi-directional overdetermination, 
          P 
          3 , should be somewhat above twice
          that value. Using equation 11, the value obtained is 1.67
          similar units. Finally, it is worthy to stress that the
          expressions for calculation of likelihood of arbitrary
          levels of over-determination (Eq. 5-11) can be inverted
          to anticipate the level of over-determination for
          arbitrary probability levels. This use of the null random
          model is also included in the accompanying online tool
          (see Abstract for URL).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          USM of biological sequences
          The representation of biological information as
          discrete sequences is dominated by the fact that genomes
          are sequences of discrete units and so are the products
          of its transcription and translation. However, not all
          biological sequences are composed of units that are
          functionally equally distinct from each other, as is the
          case of proteomic data and Multi-locus sequence typing
          [MLST, 4]. To avoid the issue of unit inequality and
          highlight the general applicability of the USM procedure,
          stanzas of a poem were used to illustrate the
          implementation instead. Nevertheless the original
          motivation of analyzing biological sequences is now
          recalled.
          In the preceding report the authors have illustrated
          the properties of unidirectional 
          n-metric estimation of similarity
          for the threonine operon of 
          E. coli [ 12 ] . The same two two
          regions of 
          thrA and 
          thrB sequences of 
          E. coli K-12 MG1655 are compared in
          Figure 5to highlight the advancement achieved by USM. It
          should be recalled that the particular dimensionality of
          DNA sequences, 
          n = 2, allows a very convenient
          unidirectional bi-dimensional representation, which is in
          fact the Chaos Game Representation procedure (CGR) [ 5 ]
          . Consequently, CGR is a particular case of USM, obtained
          when 
          n = 2 and only the forward
          coordinates are determined. This can also be verified by
          comparing Figure 5awith a similar representation reported
          before [ 12 ] , obtained with the same data using CGR
          [Fig. 10 of that report]. The advantageous properties of
          full (bi-directional) USM become apparent when Fig. 5ais
          compared with Fig. 5b. It is clearly apparent for
          bi-directional USM (Fig. 5b) that all pair-wise
          comparisons of units of identical segments now have the
          same 
          D values. This coverts any
          individual homologous pair-wise comparison into an
          estimation of the length of the entire similar segment.
          The conservation of statistical properties by the
          distances obtained, 
          D, can also be confirmed by
          comparing observed values with the corresponding null
          models (Fig. 4). For the analysis of this figure it is
          noteworthy to recall that the statistical properties of
          prokaryote DNA are often undistinguishable from uniform
          randomness [ 12 18 19 ] . The genomic sequence of the
          first gene of the threonine operon of 
          E. coli, thrA, is compared with
          that of the second, 
          thrB. The distribution of the
          resulting 
          D values is represented in figure
          4(solid black line), alongside with the null model for
          that dimensionality (Eq. 11, with 
          n = log 
          2 
          (4) = 2 , gray dotted line). The
          genomic sequences of 
          thrA and 
          thrB were translated into proteomic
          sequences using SwissProt's on line translator, applied
          to the 5'3' first frame
          http://www.expasy.ch/tools/dna.html. Similarly, the
          distribution of 
          D values for the comparison of the
          proteomic 
          thrA and 
          thrB sequences is also represented
          in Figure 4, alongside with the null model, Eq. 11, for
          its dimensionality ( 
          n = log 
          2 ( 
          uu = 20 possible aminoacids) =
          4.32 ), which is graphically nearly undistiguishable
          from that of the comparison between the stanzas, with 
          n = log 
          2 ( 
          uu = 19 possible letters) =
          4.25 (dotted gray line for the rounded value, 
          n = 4.3). Both the genomic and the
          proteomic distribution of 
          D values is observed to be
          contained by the null model, unlike the comparison
          between the stanzas discussed above, where the existence
          of structure is clearly reflected by its distribution.
          The genomic and proteomic of 
          thrA and 
          thraB, used to illustrate this
          discussion, are provided with the web-based
          implementation of USM (see Methods for URL).
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The mounting quantity and complexity of biological
        sequence data being produced [ 22 ] commands the
        investigation of new approaches to sequence analysis. In
        particular, the need for scale independent methodologies
        becomes even more necessary as the limitations of
        conventional Markov chains are increasingly noted [ 6 ] .
        These limitations are bound to become overwhelming when
        signals such as succession schemes of the expression of
        over 30,000 human genes [ 23 ] become available. This
        particular signal would be conveniently packaged within a
        30 dimension USM unit block ( 
        n = ceil(log 
        2 ( 
        3 10 3) = 15).
        In addition, the advances in statistical mechanics for
        the study of complex systems, particularly in non-linear
        dynamics, have not been fully utilizable for the analysis
        of sequences due to the missing formal link between
        discrete sequences and trajectories in continuous spaces.
        The properties of USM reported above suggest that this may
        indeed be such a bridge. For example, the embedding of
        dimensions, a technique at the foundations of many
        time-series analysis techniques offers a good example of
        the completeness of USM representation of sequences. By
        embedding the forward and backward coordinates separately,
        at the relevant memory length, the resulting embedded USM
        is exactly what would be obtained by applying USM technique
        to the embedded dimeric sequence itself.

          Computation
          The algorithms described in this manuscript were coded
          using MATLAB™ 6.0 language (Release 12), licensed by The
          MathWorks Inc http://www.mathworks.com. An internet
          interface was also developed to make them freely
          accessible through user-friendly web-pages

          Source code
          In order to facilitate the development of sequence
          analysis applications based on the USM state space, the
          software library of functions written to calculate the
          USM coordinates is provided with the web-based
          implementation (see address above). The code is provided
          in MATLAB format, which is general enough as to be easily
          ported into other environments. These functions process
          sequences provided as text files in FASTA format. In
          addition to the functions, the test datasets and a brief
          readme.txt documentation file are also included.
        
        
          Test data
          The USM mapping proposed is applicable to any discrete
          sequence, even if the primary goal is the analysis of
          biological sequences. For ease of illustration and to
          emphasize USM's general validity, the test dataset used
          to describe implementation of the algorithm consists of
          two stanzas of a Poem by Wendy Cope, "The Uncertainty of
          the Poet" [ 14 ] . In the Discussion section, USM was
          also applied to the DNA sequence of the threonine operon
          of 
          Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655,
          obtained from the University of Winsconsin 
          E. coli Genome Project
          http:/www.genetics.wisc.edu, and to its 5'3' first frame
          proteomic translation obtained by using SwissProt on line
          translator http://www.expasy.ch/tools/dna.html. The three
          test sequence datasets are also included in the web-based
          USM application.
