        Fibronectin can control many aspects of cell behavior,
        including cell growth, migration and differentiation [ 1 ]
        . Fibronectin exists in the blood as a dimer, but in
        tissues it is in the form of an insoluble fibrillar matrix.
        The fibrillar form of fibronectin is thought to be the most
        relevant form in vivo because this is the form with which
        most cells interact [ 1 ] . Various lines of evidence
        suggest that the fibrillar matrix form of fibronectin
        exerts effects on cells that are not duplicated by the
        dimeric form of fibronectin. For example, high
        concentrations of dimeric fibronectin enhance cell
        migration whereas high concentrations of fibrillar
        fibronectin reduce cell migration [ 2 ] . Also, inhibition
        of fibronectin matrix assembly has been shown to inhibit
        cell growth in various systems [ 3 4 5 ] . These findings
        suggest that fibrillar fibronectin may stimulate signal
        transduction pathways in cells that are either not
        stimulated, or only marginally stimulated, by dimeric
        fibronectin.
        Fibronectin matrix assembly is a cell-mediated process
        that requires the activity of integrins [ 1 6 7 8 ] . The
        integrin that is primarily responsible for assembling
        fibronectin into the matrix is α5β1, although αvβ3, αllbβ3
        and α4β1 can also function in this capacity [ 9 10 11 12 13
        14 ] . In addition to integrins, fibronectin matrix
        assembly also depends on self-association sites within
        fibronectin. For example, the N-terminal 70 kDa region, the
        1 sttype III repeat and the 10 thtype III repeat are
        thought to be important for the proper alignment of
        fibronectin molecules during matrix assembly [ 15 16 17 18
        19 20 21 22 ] . We and others have shown that a recombinant
        protein representing a portion of the first type III repeat
        (protein III1-C) can affect fibronectin matrix assembly and
        cell growth [ 2 3 4 16 ] . Moreover, a mutant recombinant
        fibronectin molecule that is lacking the first seven type
        III repeats has been shown to lead to defective fibronectin
        matrix assembly in cell culture and in vivo, and to
        inhibition of cell proliferation [ 23 24 ] . Although the
        matrix produced with fibronectin lacking the first seven
        type III repeats was somewhat aberrant, this study does
        show that some matrix assembly can occur without the first
        type III repeat. Therefore, several approaches reveal that
        the fibronectin type III repeats, and especially the first
        type III repeat, play important roles in the regulation of
        fibronectin matrix assembly and cell growth.
        III1-C is known to inhibit cell proliferation [ 3 4 ] .
        Recently, III1-C (also known as anastellin) has been shown
        to inhibit angiogenesis, and tumor growth and metastasis [
        25 ] . In the present study we examine how cells interact
        with and respond to III1-C, with a particular focus on
        signaling through the Ras/ERK pathway. We find that cells
        can adhere and spread on III1-C and that two classes of
        receptors function in cell adhesion to III1-C; integrins
        and cell-surface proteoglycans.
      
      
        Results
        
          Cell attachment and spreading on the first type III
          repeat of fibronectin
          III1-C is a recombinant fibronectin fragment that
          encompasses most of the first type III repeat, but is
          missing the A and B β-strands of the repeat [ 2 ] . We
          had previously found that III1-C inhibited the growth of
          normal diploid smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in culture [ 4
          ] . During these experiments we noticed that the presence
          of III1-C in the culture medium affected the morphology
          of cells at early times after plating. As shown in Figure
          1, cells plated onto fibronectin coated dishes attached
          and spread well, typically containing numerous
          lamellipodia per cell (Fig. 1A, panel FN). Cells seeded
          onto fibronectin coated dishes with III1-C in the culture
          medium spread more extensively and in a more circular
          pattern at early times after plating than cells plated on
          fibronectin in the absence of III1-C (Fig. 1A, panels FN
          and FN+C, and Fig. 1B). Cells cultured on fibronectin for
          4 hours show approximately the same extent of spreading
          as cells on fibronectin plus III1-C (Fig. 1B), indicating
          that III1-C accelerated the rate of spreading of the
          cells but did not affect the eventual extent of
          spreading. The effect on cell morphology was specific for
          III1-C because the negative control protein III 11-C (a
          recombinant protein derived from the 11 thtype III repeat
          in fibronectin, which, similar to III1-C, is missing the
          A and B β-strands of this repeat) had no effect on the
          morphology of the cells (Fig. 1A, panel FN+11C, and Fig.
          1B). Interestingly, the effect of III1-C on cell
          morphology was seen even when the plates had 
          not been coated with fibronectin
          (Fig. 1A, panel C, and Fig. 1B), indicating that intact
          fibronectin was not required for cell attachment and
          spreading when III1-C was in the culture medium. Again,
          the negative control protein III 11-C had no effect on
          cell morphology; cells seeded onto uncoated plates with
          III 11-C in the culture medium remained rounded and did
          not appreciably spread over several hours (Fig. 1A, panel
          11C, and Fig. 1B). These results indicated that III1-C
          had an effect on the morphology of freshly plated cells.
          Moreover, the plates did not need to be coated with any
          adhesive protein prior to seeding the cells with III1-C
          in the culture medium, indicating that III1-C may have
          adsorbed onto the tissue culture plastic and that cells
          then attached and spread on the adsorbed III1-C.
          To directly test whether cells were able to bind to
          III1-C coated on a dish, various concentrations of either
          fibronectin, III1-C or III 11-C were coated onto dishes
          and cell attachment to these substrates was measured. As
          shown in Figure 2, cells attach well to fibronectin and
          to III1-C, but not to III 11-C coated on a dish. On a
          molar basis, III1-C was less effective at supporting cell
          attachment than fibronectin, however, it was clear that
          RASMCs do attach and spread well on III1-C coated on a
          dish. The morphology of the cells seeded onto the
          III1-C-coated wells was indistinguishable from the
          morphology shown in Fig. 1A, panel C.
        
        
          Role of integrins in cell attachment to
          III1-C
          The attachment of RASMCs to III1-C was analyzed
          further to determine the role played by integrins as
          potential adhesive receptors for III1-C. Various
          integrin-blocking reagents were tested for their ability
          to block RASMC attachment to III1-C and to fibronectin.
          The adhesion of SMCs to fibronectin is mediated through
          β1 integrins [ 1 26 ] . We confirmed these previous
          findings for our RASMCs, by showing a complete block of
          cell attachment to fibronectin by EDTA (an agent that
          blocks all integrins), anti-β1 blocking mAb, and RGD
          peptide, but not by the negative control RAD peptide
          (Fig. 3A). Anti-fibronectin antibodies also effectively
          blocked RASMC attachment to fibronectin (Fig. 3A).
          Heparin did not inhibit cell attachment to fibronectin
          (Fig. 3A), however, it did modestly reduce cell spreading
          on fibronectin (15% inhibition of cell spreading, data
          not shown). These results indicate that RASMC adhesion to
          fibronectin is mediated by β1 integrins.
          Blocking studies indicated that cell attachment to
          III1-C was partially mediated by β1 integrins. For
          example, RASMC attachment was partially blocked by EDTA,
          anti-β1 mAb, and RGD peptide (Fig. 3B), indicating the
          involvement of integrins. However, cell attachment was
          also partially blocked by heparin, which did not inhibit
          cell attachment to fibronectin (Fig. 3Aand 3B, Hep
          samples), indicating that a non-integrin receptor also
          mediated cell attachment to III1-C. A complete block of
          cell attachment to III1-C was only observed when heparin
          was combined with integrin blocking agents; e.g., heparin
          + anti-β1 mAb or heparin + RGD peptide (Fig. 3B).
          Anti-fibronectin antibodies modestly inhibited cell
          attachment, but anti-III 1-C antibodies effectively
          blocked cell attachment to III1-C (Fig. 3B). These
          results demonstrate that cell attachment to III1-C was
          mediated through both β1 integrins and another class of
          receptors on RASMCs.
          One way in which integrins were originally shown to be
          fibronectin receptors was by affinity chromatography of
          radioiodinated cell surface proteins on a fibronectin
          column [ 27 28 ] . Consistent with these earlier studies,
          cell surface radioiodination of RASMCs followed by
          affinity chromatography on fibronectin Sepharose and
          elution with EDTA revealed the binding of two major bands
          at 120 kDa and 140 kDa (Fig. 4,Elane under FN). These
          sizes match those of the β1 and α5 integrin submits,
          respectively, that have been shown by affinity
          chromatography to bind to the cell binding domain (i.e.,
          10 thtype III repeat) of fibronectin [ 27 28 29 30 31 ] .
          Affinity chromatography on a III1-C Sepharose column
          revealed the binding of three major bands of sizes 120
          kDa, 140 kDa and 150 kDa (Fig. 4,Elane under C). The 120
          kDa and 140 kDa bands likely represent the β1 and α5
          subunits (as above), while the 150 kDa band may represent
          either the α2 or α3 integrin subunits, which are known to
          be expressed by VSMCs [ 26 ] . Affinity chromatography on
          the control III 11-C column yielded no radioiodinated
          proteins that were eluted from the column (Fig. 4,Elane
          under 11C). These results are consistent with the
          hypothesis that one or more pi integrins act as receptors
          for III1-C. Taken together with the integrin-blocking
          results described above, it is clear that RASMC adhesion
          to III1-C is partially mediated through β1 integrins.
        
        
          Cell adhesion to III1-C activates ERK1/2
          Integrins are known to activate signaling pathways in
          cells [ 32 33 34 35 ] . Among the most well-studied
          signaling pathways is the Ras/MAPK pathway leading to
          activation of ERK1 and ERK2 [ 36 ] . We therefore decided
          to test the effect of cell adhesion to III1-C on ERK
          activation. As expected, treatment of RASMCs with PDGF
          resulted in activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 5, PDGF lanes).
          Plating RASMCs onto a fibronectin coated dish in the
          absence of growth factors yielded moderate activation of
          ERK1/2, which peaked at 30 min then decreased somewhat
          over the next 30 min of the experiment (Fig. 5, bottom
          panel). However, plating cells onto a III1-C coated dish
          gave strong activation of ERK1/2, which peaked at 30 min
          and remained relatively constant for the subsequent 30
          min (Fig. 5, top panel). The control protein III 11-C did
          not appreciably stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5,
          11C lanes, both panels). Thus, the adhesion of RASMCs to
          III1-C resulted in robust activation of ERK1/2 that was
          comparable to the activation obtained with PDGF.
        
        
          ERK activation by III1-C is dependent on β1
          integrins
          As shown above, several agents that block β1 integrin
          function partially inhibit cell attachment to III1-C. We
          therefore tested the effects of these agents on ERK1/2
          activation by III1-C. The results obtained with ERK1/2
          activation closely paralleled the results obtained with
          cell attachment to III1-C, except that the individual
          blocking agents were relatively more efficient at
          inhibiting ERK1/2 activation. For example, heparin, EDTA,
          anti-β1 mAb and RGD peptide all significantly inhibited
          ERK1/2 activation by cell adhesion to III1-C (Fig. 6).
          Heparin was most effective and completely blocked ERK1/2
          activation. (Fig. 6). In contrast, the negative control
          RAD peptide did not inhibit ERK1/2 activation by III1-C
          (Fig. 6, C+RAD lane). These results indicate that both
          integrins and the class of receptors inhibited by heparin
          were required for III1-C mediated activation of
          ERK1/2.
        
        
          Role of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in cell
          adhesion to III1-C and ERK1/2 activation by III1-C
          Because heparin was able to inhibit the attachment of
          cells to III1-C and the activation of ERK1/2 by III1-C,
          we tested the effect of other glycosaminoglycans on
          III1-C stimulated ERK1/2 activity. Heparin, heparan
          sulfate and dermatan sulfate blocked ERK1/2 activation by
          III1-C (Fig. 7), and cell adhesion to III1-C (not shown).
          In contrast, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin-4-sulfate and
          chondroitin-6-sulfate had no effect on the ability of
          III1-C to stimulate ERK1/2 activity (Fig. 7) or on the
          adhesion of cells to III1-C (not shown). It is possible
          that heparin, heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate
          inhibit III1-C mediated cell adhesion and ERK1/2
          activation due to common chemical features. For example,
          heparin, heparan sulfate, and dermatan sulfate all
          contain iduronic acid residues whereas chondroitin
          sulfate and hyaluronic acid do not. The results presented
          above indicate that a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)
          or dermatan sulfate proteoglycan on the surface of RASMCs
          may serve as a receptor for III1-C.
          To further explore the possibility that a cell surface
          proteoglycan serves as a receptor for III1-C, RASMCs were
          treated with the glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes
          seeded onto III1-C, and analyzed for the activation of
          ERK1/2. Heparitinase treatment, but not chondroitinase
          ABC treatment decreased the amount of ERK1/2 activation
          by III1-C (Fig. 8). Heparitinase treatment also inhibited
          cell adhesion by 25-40%, while chondroitinase ABC
          treatment did not inhibit cell adhesion to III1-C (not
          shown). This result is consistent with the idea that
          HSPGs but not chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans serve as
          signaling receptors for III1-C.
          To identify the cell surface proteoglycans that may
          serve as receptors for III1-C, RASMCs were labeled with
          35SO 
          4 and cell lysates were applied to
          III1-C and III 11-C columns. The most highly labeled
          band, migrating in a smear at about 450 kDa, bound
          efficiently to the III1-C column (Fig. 9A, compare flow
          through and elution lanes). This proteoglycan resisted
          elution by 8 M urea but was eluted by boiling the
          Sepharose beads in SDS (Fig. 9A). This same proteoglycan
          did not bind appreciably to the III 11-C column (Fig.
          9A). Heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC treatment of the
          35SO 
          4 labeled samples revealed that the
          450 kDa proteoglycan was composed mostly of HSPGs (Fig.
          9B). These results indicate that most of the cell surface
          HSPGs of RASMCs can bind to III1-C in affinity
          chromatography.
          RASMC HSPGs were analyzed further by immunoblotting
          with the monoclonal antibody 3G10 which specifically
          recognizes desaturated uronates on the heparan sulfate
          stubs that remain associated with core proteins after
          heparitinase digestion [ 37 ] . Complete digestion of
          RASMC lysates with heparitinase reveals major bands at 46
          kDa and 70 kDa, indicating that these are the sizes of
          the major HSPG core proteins (not shown). RASMC lysates
          were subjected to partial heparitinase treatment (full
          digestion was not performed in order to allow some GAGs
          to remain associated with the core proteins) then applied
          to either III1-C or III 11-C Sepharose. As shown in Fig.
          10, most of the 46 kDa and 70 kDa HSPGs bound to III1-C
          Sepharose but not to III 11-C Sepharose. In addition, the
          presence of heparin in the lysate inhibited the 46 kDa
          and 70 kDa HSPGs from binding to the III1-C column (Fig.
          10, compare C and C•H lanes). The inhibition of 46 kDa
          and 70 kDa binding to III1-C by heparin suggests that
          these HSPGs may serve as receptors for III1-C in cell
          adhesion and ERK1/2 signaling.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have found that cells can interact with a portion of
        the fibronectin first type III repeat, leading to cell
        adhesion and activation of ERK, and that this signaling
        requires both cell surface HSPGs and integrins. RASMCs are
        able to adhere to and spread on III1-C. Adhesion to III1-C
        results in robust activation of ERK; comparable to that
        seen with PDGF stimulation. Several independent lines of
        evidence indicate that cell surface HSPGs and β1 integrins
        act as receptors for III1-C and are required for cell
        adhesion and ERK activation by III1-C. For example, various
        β1 integrin blocking agents inhibit cell attachment to
        III1-C and ERK activation by III1-C. In addition,
        inhibition by heparin, heparan-sulfate, and heparitinase,
        but not by chondroitin sulfates or chondroitinase ABC all
        point to the importance of HSPGs as receptors. Affinity
        chromatography with 125I surface labeled proteins resulted
        in the binding of proteins of the appropriate sizes of β1
        integrins to both FN and III1-C columns. Moreover, affinity
        chromatography with 35SO 
        4 -labeled cells suggests that HSPGs
        with core protein sizes of 46 kDa and 70 kDa serve as
        III1-C receptors. Taken together, these results indicate
        that the first type III repeat of fibronectin can serve as
        a cell binding domain and that both integrins and cell
        surface HSPGs function as receptors for this type III
        repeat.
        Our results demonstrate that both integrins and cell
        surface HSPGs are required for robust ERK 1/2 activation
        when cells adhere to III1-C. These results are one of the
        first demonstrations that HSPGs can activate the ERK
        signaling pathway. Another example of this closely
        parallels our findings [ 38 ] . The adhesion of Jurkat T
        cells to thrombospondin-1 has been shown to require the
        cooperation of three classes of receptors; β1 integrins,
        CD47 and HSPGs [ 38 ] . Adhesion of the Jurkat T cells to
        thrombospondin-1 stimulates ERK1/2 activation and the
        binding of HSPGs to thrombospondin-1 is required for this
        signaling. The particular HSPGs that mediate ERK1/2
        activation in Jurkat T cells have not been identified,
        however, the authors speculate that syndecans may
        participate in the adhesion and signaling in that system [
        38 ] . This may also be the case in our system, as
        described below.
        One major family of cell surface HSPGs is the syndecan
        family. There are 4 members in the syndecan family
        (syndecan-1 through-4) [ 39 40 ] . Syndecan-1, -2 and -4
        are known to bind to extracellular matrix proteins and
        syndecan-1 and -4 have been shown to support stress fiber
        formation in conjunction with integrins [ 41 42 43 44 45 ]
        . The HSPGs we have identified as III1-C receptors have
        core proteins that migrate at the approximate sizes of
        syndecan-1 (~69 kDa core protein) and syndecan-2 (~48 kDa
        core protein) [ 40 ] . It is therefore possible that our 46
        kDa and 70 kDa HSPGs represent syndecan family members. As
        described above, the syndecans may cooperate with β1
        integrins and CD47 to activate the ERK signaling pathway in
        T cells [ 38 ] . A similar mechanism may apply to the
        adhesion of RASMCs to III1-C. Future studies will determine
        the identity of the HSPGs that act as III1-C receptors.
        The Ras/MAPK pathway is typically thought to be a part
        of a mitogenic pathway [ 36 ] . However, we and others have
        shown that prolonged treatment with III1-C can inhibit cell
        proliferation [ 3 4 ] , and here we show that cell adhesion
        to III1-C can activate ERK1/2. One possible explanation for
        this apparent discrepancy is that although ERK1/2 are often
        involved in mitogenesis, in SMCs ERK activation can lead to
        inhibition of proliferation [ 46 ] . This occurs through
        ERK-mediated stimulation of PGE 
        2 production, which then inhibits the
        proliferation of SMCs [ 46 ] . Further experiments will
        determine whether RASMCs produce PGE 
        2 after treatment with III1-C. Another
        possibility is that III1-C stimulates other signaling
        pathways apart from the ERK pathway, and that one of the
        other signaling pathways inhibits proliferation of the
        cells. The relationship between ERK activation, stimulation
        of other signaling pathways and growth inhibition by III1-C
        will be elucidated by future experiments.
        The III1-C protein has recently been shown to inhibit
        angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis [ 25 ] . Those
        findings, along with our present findings reveal some
        intriguing parallels between III1-C and the angiogenesis
        inhibitor endostatin [ 47 ] . For example, both III1-C and
        endostatin are fragments of matrix proteins and can inhibit
        angiogenesis and tumor growth. In addition, recent work has
        shown that cells interact with endostatin through two
        classes of receptors; integrins and glypicans (cell surface
        HSPGs) [ 48 49 ] . This parallels our findings in this
        present report, that cells interact with III1-C through
        integrins and cell surface HSPGs. Therefore, III1-C and
        endostatin may inhibit angiogenesis through related
        mechanisms involving both integrins and HSPGs. Future work
        will determine the relative contributions of these two
        classes of receptors in the biological effects of
        III1-C.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have found that cells can interact with the
        fibronectin first type III repeat, leading to cell adhesion
        and activation of ERK, and that this signaling requires
        both cell surface HSPGs and integrins. Results from various
        independent types of experiments indicate that the first
        type III repeat of fibronectin can serve as a cell binding
        domain and that both integrins and cell surface HSPGs
        function as receptors for this type III repeat.

          The purified glycosaminoglycans used in this study
          were a generous gift of Dr. Nancy Schwartz (Univ. of
          Chicago). The glycosaminoglycans were produced under a
          contract from the National Institute of Arthritis and
          Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIH) and serve as
          reference standards. The tissue sources of the
          glycosaminoglycans were as follows: hyaluronic acid,
          human umbilical cord; heparan sulfate, beef lung;
          dermatan sulfate, hog mucosa; chondroitin-4-sulfate,
          notochord from river sturgeon (S. platorhynchus), and
          chondroitin-6-sulfate, cranial cartilage of river
          sturgeon.
        
        
          Cell culture
          Primary rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) were
          isolated from 12-16 week old Sprague-Dawley rats as
          described previously [ 51 ] . RASMCs were cultured in
          DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and glutamine Pen-Strep.
          RASMCs were typically between passages 2 and 7 for
          experiments.
        
        
          Recombinant protein production
          Proteins III1-C and III 11-C (previously called III 
          11 ) were produced in bacteria and
          purified as described previously [ 2 ] . III1-C
          encompasses fibronectin amino acids 600-674
          (Asn-Ala-Pro-Gln-...Thr-Ser-Thr-Pro), and III 11-C amino
          acids 1,532-1,599 (Leu-Pro-Ser-Ser-...Thr-Ala-Val-Thr),
          according to the previously published numbering method [
          52 ] . The recombinant proteins were expressed by the
          pQE-12 vector, which places a 6-His coding sequence at
          the C-terminus of each protein. The proteins were
          purified on Ni-agarose columns and were >98% pure as
          judged by SDS-PAGE and coomassie staining. Stock protein
          solutions were typically 700 μM for III1-C and 520 μM for
          III 11-C in PBS.
          Anti-III1-C antibodies were produced by immunizing
          rabbits with III1-C. After one month the rabbits were
          boosted and serum samples were collected every two weeks.
          The rabbit serum was applied to an affinity column to
          purify the anti-III 1-C antibodies. In order to avoid
          purifying antibodies to the 6-His tag in III1-C, the
          affinity column was made with a GST fusion protein. The 1
          sttype III repeat of fibronectin was expressed as a
          fusion protein coupled to GST, and this GST-3FN1 fusion
          protein was coupled to Sepharose and used in affinity
          purification. Bound antibodies were eluted with 100 mM
          triethylamine, pH 11.5 and the pH was neutralized with 1
          M Tris, pH 8; (the antibody concentration was 0.4 mg/ml).
          BSA (0.5 mg/ml) was added to stabilize the antibody for
          subsequent handling. The antibody prep was dialyzed
          extensively against PBS before use.
        
        
          Cell attachment and spreading assays
          For the cell spreading assay shown in Fig. 1,
          fibronectin (20 μg/ml) was coated onto 24-well dishes for
          1 hr at RT. The wells were washed 3 times with PBS before
          adding cells. Growing RASMCs were harvested by
          trypsinization and collected into DMEM + 0.5% BSA +
          soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were washed 3 times with
          DMEM + 0.5% BSA, then resuspended at 1 × 10 5cells/ml in
          DMEM + 0.5% BSA, in the absence or presence of 25 μM
          III1-C or 25 μM III 11-C in the medium. Cells were seeded
          onto the wells (0.5 ml/well, ~30% confluence), placed in
          a 37°C incubator and allowed to adhere for either 7, 15,
          30, 60, 120 or 240 min. Cells were then fixed with 3.7%
          paraformaldehyde, 60 mM sucrose in TBS, followed by
          staining with Coomassie Blue dye (1 mg/ml Coomassie
          Brilliant Blue, 45% MeOH, 10% acetic acid). Cells were
          destained with water, air-dried, then photographed with a
          Leica DM IRB phase microscope connected to a Polaroid CCD
          camera and an Apple Macintosh computer for capturing
          images. To quantitate the amount of spreading, each image
          was analyzed with the NIH Image 1.61 application to
          determine the total amount of area covered by cells and
          this number was divided by the total number of cells in
          the image to give an average area per cell (in pixels
          2/cell).
          Cell attachment assays shown in Fig. 2and 3were done
          essentially as described previously [ 2 ] . Briefly,
          fibronectin, III1-C or III 11-C at various concentrations
          were coated onto 96-well dishes for 1 hr at RT. The wells
          were then washed 3 times with PBS before adding cells.
          Growing RASMCs were harvested by trypsinization and
          collected into DMEM + 0.5% BSA + soybean trypsin
          inhibitor. Cells were washed 3 times with DMEM + 0.5%
          BSA, then resuspended at 4 × 10 5cells/ml in DMEM + 0.5%
          BSA with or without inhibitors, as indicated in the
          figures. Cells were seeded onto the coated wells and
          allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were then
          fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, 60 mM sucrose in TBS,
          followed by 20% methanol, and staining in 0.5% crystal
          violet in 20% methanol. Stained cells were washed with
          water and the dye was solubilized with 0.1 M sodium
          citrate, pH 4.2, 50% ethanol. Attachment was quantitated
          by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm.
        
        
          125I cell surface labeling and affinity
          chromatography
          The procedure was a modification of the procedure used
          to isolate the fibronectin receptor and other integrins [
          27 28 ] . The affinity resins were prepared by coupling
          fibronectin, III1-C or III 11-C to CNBr-activated
          Sepharose CL-4B according to the manufacturer's
          recommendations. The concentration of protein was
          typically 4-5 mg fibronectin/ml of resin, or 8-10 mg
          protein/ml of resin for III1-C and III 11-C. Ten 15-cm
          dishes of RASMCs were washed twice with PBS, then
          harvested by detachment of cells in PBS + 10 mM EDTA. The
          cells were washed twice more with PBS, then resuspended
          at 4 × 10 7cells/ml in PBS. Cells were labeled with 1 mCi
          Na 125I and lactoperoxidase-H 
          2 O 
          2 , as previously described [ 27 ] .
          After labeling the cell pellet was washed with ice-cold
          PBS + NaN 
          3 , then lysed in 2 volumes of OG
          Lysis Buffer (200 mM octylglucoside, 1 mM CaCl 
          2 , 1 mM MgCl 
          2 , TBS, PMSF) at 4°C. The lysate was
          spun at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant
          was used for affinity chromatography. Lysate was applied
          to the affinity columns (0.2 ml lysate was applied to 0.1
          ml affinity matrix bed volume), flow through fractions
          were collected and passed over the columns twice more.
          Columns were washed with 10 column volumes of Wash Buffer
          (40 mM octylglucoside, 1 mM CaCl 
          2 , 1 mM MgCl 
          2 , TBS), before elution of bound
          protein with 10 mM EDTA in Wash Buffer. Samples from the
          final wash and eluted samples were separated on 4-20%
          gradient Novex gels, the gels were dried and exposed to
          phosphorimager cassette and the radioactive signal was
          measured with a Storm phosphorimager instrument.
        
        
          MAPK assay and immunoblotting
          Wells of a 6-well plate were coated with either 20
          μg/ml fibronectin, 25 μM III1-C or 25 μM III 11-C for 1
          hr at RT. Wells were washed 3 times with PBS before
          adding cells. Growing RASMCs were harvested by
          trypsinization and collected into DMEM + 0.5% BSA +
          soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were washed 3 times with
          DMEM + 0.5% BSA, then resuspended at 3 × 10 5cells/ml in
          DMEM + 0.5% BSA with or without integrin blocking agents
          or other additions, as described in the figure legends.
          Cells were either left in suspension (for suspended and
          PDGF stimulated samples) or were seeded onto the coated
          wells (1 ml per well) and allowed to adhere for 30 min at
          37°C, or for the times indicated in the figure legend
          (Fig. 5). The cells stimulated with PDGF (2 ng/ml
          PDGF-BB) received the growth factor 10 min before
          collecting the cells for lysis, while the other samples
          received no growth factor or serum. After the adhesion
          period plates were placed on ice, unattached cells were
          collected and spun down, while cell monolayers were
          washed once with ice cold PBS then lysed with SDS-PAGE
          sample buffer (100 μl/well). Centrifuged pellets of
          unattached cells were combined with the appropriate
          monolayer lysate sample and the samples were heated to
          100°C for 5 min. Samples were separated on 4-20% gradient
          Novex gels, transferred to Immobilon P membranes, blocked
          with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-Tween, then probed with
          anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody according to the
          manufacturer's recommendations. Blots were then stripped
          in Stripping Buffer (2% SDS, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol,
          62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.7) at 50°C for 30 min, washed 4 times
          with TBS-Tween, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in
          TBS-Tween, then probed with anti-p44/42 ERK antibody
          according to the manufacturer's recommendations. All
          blots were developed with the ECL plus reagent and
          exposed to Hyperfilm. For both antibodies the typical
          exposure times were under 5 min.
        
        
          Heparitinase treatment of cells and lysates
          6 well plates were coated with either fibronectin,
          III1-C or III 11-C as described above. Growing RASMCs
          were harvested by trypsinization and washed in DMEM + BSA
          as described above. For GAGase treatment of intact cells,
          the cells remained in suspension and received either no
          enzyme or 0.1 u/ml heparitinase or 0.1 u/ml
          chondroitinase ABC for 1 hr at 37°C with constant gentle
          rotation. Cells were then plated onto precoated dishes
          and processed for immunoblotting with anti-phospho-p44/42
          MAPK antibody as described above. Alternatively, after
          heparitinase digestion cells were lysed directly in SDS
          sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with the
          3G10 mAb (essentially as described above for
          anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK immunoblotting).
          For GAGase treatment of cell lysates, cells were lysed
          on ice in NP40 Lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P 40, 150 mM
          NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0) plus protease inhibitors
          (Complete™ protease inhibitor cocktail) at 2 × 10
          6cells/ml. Insoluble material was removed by
          centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Lysate
          was prepared for heparitinase treatment by adding CaCl 
          2 to 10 μM final concentration.
          Heparitinase was added to 0.1 u/ml final concentration
          and the lysate was incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. The lysate
          was then applied to affinity chromatography columns as
          described below.
        
        
          35SO 4labeling and affinity chromatography
          Growing RASMCs labeled for 20 hr at 37°C with 200
          μCi/ml 35S04 in DMEM + 10% dialyzed FCS + Pen-Strep.
          Cells were placed on ice, washed once with PBS, then
          lysed in NP40 Lysis buffer as described above. III1-C and
          III 11-C columns were produced as described above. Cell
          lysates were applied to III1-C or III 11-C columns
          (typically 500 μl lysate was applied to 250 μl affinity
          matrix bed volume), flow through fractions were collected
          and passed over the columns twice more. The final flow
          through fractions were then collected. Columns were
          washed with 10 column volumes of NP40 Lysis buffer, then
          bound material was removed by boiling the Sepharose beads
          in 2 column volumes of SDS sample buffer. Alternatively,
          the bound material was first eluted with 2 column volumes
          of 8 M urea buffer (8 M urea, 0.1 M NaH 
          2 PO 
          4 , 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0), followed by
          washing with 10 column volumes of NP40 Lysis buffer, and
          then removing any remaining bound material by boiling the
          Sepharose beads in SDS sample buffer. Samples were
          separated on 4-20% Novex SDS-PAGE gels, the gels were
          fixed and dried and the radioactive material was detected
          by using a phosphorimager.
