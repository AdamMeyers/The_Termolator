        Signal transduction is the primary means by which cells
        coordinate their metabolic, morphologic, and genetic
        responses to environmental cues such as growth factors,
        hormones, nutrients, osmolarity, and other chemical and
        tactile stimuli. Traditionally, the discovery of molecular
        components of signaling networks in yeast and mammals has
        relied upon the use of gene knockouts and epistasis
        analysis. Although these methods have been highly effective
        in generating detailed descriptions of specific linear
        signaling pathways, our knowledge of complex signaling
        networks and their interactions remains incomplete. New
        computational methods that capture molecular details from
        high-throughput genomic data in an automated fashion are
        desirable and can help direct the established techniques of
        molecular biology and genetics.
        DNA microarray technology has evolved to the point where
        one can simultaneously measure the transcript abundance of
        thousands of genes under hundreds of conditions, producing
        hundreds of thousands of individual data points. Similarly,
        high-throughput yeast two-hybrid experiments have
        identified thousands of pairwise protein-protein
        interactions. Once a core pathway is established, these
        data can readily be integrated into model refinements, as a
        recent study in systems biology elegantly demonstrates [ 1
        ] . However, synthesizing these data 
        de novo into models of pathways and
        networks remains a significant challenge.
        How can one bridge the gap from transcript abundances
        and protein-protein interaction data to pathway models?
        Clustering expression data into groups of genes that share
        profiles is a proven method for grouping functionally
        related genes, but does not order pathway components
        according to physical or regulatory relationships. Here we
        present an automated approach for modelling signal
        transduction networks in 
        S. cerevisiae by integrating
        protein-protein interaction [ 2 3 4 ] and gene expression
        data. Our program, NetSearch, draws all possible linear
        paths of a specified length through the interaction map
        starting at any membrane protein and ending on any
        DNA-binding protein. Microarray expression data [ 5 6 7 ]
        is then used to rank all paths according to the degree of
        similarity in the expression profiles of pathway members.
        Linear pathways that have common starting points and
        endpoints and the highest ranks are then combined into the
        final model of the branched networks.
        Our approach is calibrated using the yeast MAPK
        (mitogen-activated protein kinases) pathways involved in
        pheromone response, filamentous growth, and maintenance of
        cell wall integrity (Fig. 1). These pathways are activated
        by G protein-coupled receptors and characterized by a core
        cascade of MAP kinases that activate each other through
        sequential binding and phosphorylation reactions; they are
        among the most thoroughly studied networks in yeast and are
        therefore excellent benchmarks against which to test our
        approach.
      
      
        Results
        
          Input data and parameters
          Recent papers [ 2 3 4 ] have used the yeast-two-hybrid
          technique and literature surveys to identify and assemble
          over 7000 non-redundant protein-protein interactions
          among more than 4000 proteins. While two-hybrid screens
          efficiently identify fusion proteins that are able to
          interact, the biological significance of the interaction
          for native proteins acting 
          in vivo generally requires
          verification, because the technique is susceptible to a
          high rate of false positives [ 8 ] . To assess the
          possible contribution of false-positive protein-protein
          interactions to the combined interaction dataset, we
          analyzed the connectivity of each protein and found that
          a small fraction of proteins had a very high number of
          interactions (highlighted in red, Fig. 2). With these
          highly connected proteins included in our data set,
          NetSearch generates 17 million candidate signaling
          pathways of length seven or less, 95% of which involve
          one of these twenty-two highly-connected proteins. We
          excluded the highly interacting proteins from the
          interaction dataset based on their nonspecific inclusion
          in the predicted pathways and evidence of their
          susceptibility to systematic error. This yielded an
          interaction map that contains 5560 interactions among
          3725 proteins, an average of three interactions per
          protein.
          Using the NetSearch algorithm, this protein
          interaction network was queried for paths up to length
          eight that begin at membrane proteins and end at
          transcription factors. The search generated approximately
          4.4 million candidate pathways of length eight or less
          whose biological plausibility was assessed using gene
          expression data.
          To score the pathways, we first used a 
          k -means algorithm to cluster all
          yeast genes into clusters based on their expression
          profiles. NetSearch then assigned each pathway a
          statistical score [ 10 ] according to the number of
          pathway members that clustered together. For example, a
          path with six members in one cluster would score higher
          than a path that only had five members in that cluster.
          Cluster size influenced path scoring such that a path
          that had three members from a cluster of 30 elements
          would score higher than a path that had three members
          from a cluster of 100 elements. Also, a path with four
          elements in one cluster and three elements in a second
          cluster would score higher than a path that had four
          elements in cluster one, but no more than two elements in
          cluster two.
          Pathways were scored using NetSearch's 'sumprob'
          scoring metric: Assuming N proteins total and a
          partitioning of proteins into k clusters C 
          1 , C 
          2 ,...C 
          k , with N 
          1 , N 
          2 ,...N 
          k members, respectively, and a pathway
          p of L proteins p 
          1 →p 
          2 →...→ p 
          L , where c 
          p (i) = number of proteins in p in
          cluster C 
          i , the sumprob score is computed as
          follows:
          
          prob 
          p (i) scores a pathway for a cluster C
          
          i such that pathways which are more
          concentrated in C 
          i have higher scores. The summation in
          prob 
          p (i) computes the cumulative
          hypergeometric probability of pathway p containing c 
          p (i) or more members of C 
          i . prob 
          p (i) assesses co-clustering of
          pathway members in the single cluster C 
          i . sumprob(p), the sum of prob 
          p (i) values over all clusters for
          which c 
          p (i) >= 2, is a simple measure of
          co-clustering across the entire collection of available
          clusters. The rationale for the restriction c 
          p (i) >= 2 is that without it a
          pathway could get a high score simply from having single
          members in one or more rare clusters, in which case the
          score would no longer reflect 
          co -clustering.
          The exact composition of paths discovered using
          NetSearch depend on the parameters used in path drawing
          and path scoring. To ensure that NetSearch reproducibly
          generates statistically significant, biologically
          plausible paths, we combinatorially varied every
          parameter value in the path-drawing and path-scoring
          algorithms, and selected parameter combinations that
          generate the most statistically significant pathways.
          Statistical significance was measured by drawing pathways
          from membrane proteins to DNA-binding proteins through
          the experimentally determined protein-interaction map
          (henceforth called "real pathways") and comparing these
          pathways with pathways drawn through control interaction
          maps that were created by randomizing all pairwise
          interactions in the original dataset. (The randomization
          procedure was performed three times and statistics were
          calculated on the average output of these runs. Paths
          produced using these interaction maps are henceforth
          referred to as "random pathways"). We ultimately chose
          parameters that maximized the number of high-scoring
          pathways produced with real interactions, while
          minimizing high-scoring pathways from the randomized
          interactions.
          The parameters we varied included the number of
          clusters into which the genes were grouped, the
          microarray expression datasets used in clustering, the
          maximum path length, and the scoring metric. Expression
          data were clustered into 12, 25, 50, 100 and 250
          clusters, and NetSearch best discriminated between real
          pathways and random pathways when genes were grouped into
          25 clusters. Three 
          S. cerevisiae expression datasets
          were examined individually, including the "Compendium"
          set, composed of expression profiles in response to 300
          diverse mutations and chemical treatments [ 5 ] ; the
          "MAPK" set, composed of 56 conditions chosen to probe the
          behavior of MAPK signal transduction [ 6 ] ; and the
          "Cell Cycle" set, composed of 77 conditions relevant to
          the cell cycle [ 7 ] . Combinations of these datasets
          were also examined, for a total of five different sets
          that allowed us to compare the utility of data that
          probes specific biological processes, such as MAPK
          signaling or the cell cycle, and that which probes the
          state of the cell more broadly, such as the Compendium
          set and the combined sets. The composite data set that
          combined all three individual sets (for a total of 433
          conditions) provided the best discrimination between real
          pathways and random pathways, although the other sets
          performed comparably.
          The final input parameter that required evaluation was
          the maximum path length allowable for NetSearch paths.
          While short path lengths risk omission of key path
          members, longer path lengths increase the likelihood of
          including false-positive interactions. As a first step
          towards determining the optimal maximum path length, we
          examined the path lengths connecting every possible pair
          of the 3725 proteins in the interaction dataset,
          regardless of subcellular localization. The minimal path
          length between any two proteins chosen at random contains
          on average 7.4 members. Secondly, we examined the
          fraction of pathways with high coclustering ratios for
          various path lengths. Consistent with our finding that
          the average path length between any two proteins is 7.4,
          this fraction peaks at eight, which we set as our
          maximum, unless otherwise noted.
        
        
          NetSearch output
          Using a maximum path length of eight, and 25 gene
          clusters from 433 conditions [ 5 6 7 ] , NetSearch
          generated ~4.4 million pathways each for the real and
          randomized protein interaction datasets. From the
          experimental ("real") data, 4059 pathways had a
          coclustering score ≥ 16 (Fig. 3). At this cutoff,
          randomized interaction data produced on average only ~1%
          this number of pathways (32 pathways, P = 7 × 10 -6).
          However, we emphasize that NetSearch selects paths based
          on their rank relative to all paths between selected
          starting and endpoints. The absolute score depends on the
          particular expression data set used, and varies from
          network to network depending on the degree of
          coregulation in the cell under the conditions tested in
          the expression data.
          The signaling network models generated by NetSearch
          for the pheromone response, cell wall integrity and
          filamentation pathways are depicted in Fig. 4. In each
          case, the starting protein (receptor, depicted in blue)
          and ending protein (transcription factor, depicted in
          red) were selected as inputs, and NetSearch draws all
          possible paths between these points. The size of each
          vertex is proportional to the sum of scores of the paths
          in which that protein is found, providing a useful visual
          clue to the potential importance of a protein in the
          given network. Comparison with Fig. 1shows that NetSearch
          reproduced many of the essential elements of these MAPK
          pathways, while providing a detailed account of the
          experimentally determined interconnections among network
          elements. Of the three network models, the one generated
          for the pheromone response pathway originating at Ste3p
          (Fig. 4A) exhibited the highest co-clustering scores.
          Every protein NetSearch included in this network model
          has a description in the Yeast Proteome Database (YPD) [
          9 ] consistent with a known or plausible role in mating.
          Of the nineteen proteins we have included in our
          depiction of the pheromone response network, eighteen are
          annotated as playing a role in the fungal cell
          differentiation by MIPS [ 10 ] . The probability that
          this selection would have occurred by chance was
          calculated with the hypergeometric distribution was found
          to be P = 5 × 10 -24. Our model does differ in several
          respects from the canonical pheromone response pathway
          depicted in Fig 1. It includes more members of the
          heterotrimeric G protein complex, including the alpha,
          beta, and gamma subunits, the GDP-GTP exchange factor,
          and the GTPase-activating protein (Gpa1p, Ste4p, Ste18p,
          Cdc24p, and Sst2p, respectively). It includes Far1p, a
          protein necessary for pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest
          in G1 [ 11 ] , Mpt5p, a protein necessary for recovery
          from cell cycle arrest [ 12 ] , and Bem1p and Sph1, both
          of which are necessary for establishment of cell polarity
          during shmooing and budding [ 13 14 ] . In our
          protein-interaction map there is no direct interaction
          between a pheromone receptor (Ste2p or Ste3p) and any
          component of the heterotrimeric G protein complex
          (Ste4p/Ste18p/Gpa1p), so NetSearch drew indirect paths
          through Akr1p, a known inhibitor of signaling in the
          pheromone pathway [ 15 ] . The predicted network does not
          include the GTPase Cdc42p (paths were instead drawn
          preferentially through its cofactor Cdc24p, which
          physically interacts with Ste4p) or Ste20p, because of
          missing interactions in the protein-interaction map.
          Fig. 4Bdepicts the pheromone response network at
          several different score cutoffs, and demonstrates how
          higher co-clustering score cutoffs reduces the complexity
          of the protein-interaction map. NetSearch detects 354
          paths of length eight from Ste3p to Ste12p, and
          incorporates 70 different proteins into those paths. The
          top graph in Fig. 4Bshows the network constructed from
          all 354 paths (with each protein arranged on the
          perimeter of an ellipse for clarity). In the middle
          graph, all paths that scored below the median have been
          eliminated, leaving only 27 proteins. On the bottom of
          Fig. 4B, only the highest scoring paths (those used to
          construct the network in Fig. 4A) with 19 proteins, are
          depicted. Comparison of these networks indicates that
          most proteins are eliminated by simply excluding the
          pathways that score in the bottom half; further
          modifications to the cutoff affect the results
          incrementally. In setting a precise cutoff for pathway
          inclusion in the final network models, one seeks to
          strike a balance between the inclusion of false-positives
          and the omission of true-positives. We set the cutoff
          such that the top fifteen paths for each network were
          included.
          The network model generated for the cell wall
          integrity pathway is depicted in Fig. 4C. Membrane
          proteins in particular may fail to produce interactions
          when forced into the nucleus by the requirements of the
          standard two-hybrid technique. We observed this to be the
          case for the cell wall integrity pathway, as neither
          Wsc1p, Wsc2p, Wcs3p or Mid2p were observed to interact in
          any of the high-throughput screens. To reconstruct this
          network, we therefore started with the momomeric GTPase
          Rho1p, and restricted our search to a length of seven
          because of the omission of the initial signal sensor. Of
          the 18 proteins included in this network model, all but
          Smd3p have descriptions consistent with a role in cell
          wall maintenance. NetSearch included both GTPase
          constituents of this pathway, Rho1p and Cdc42p, as well
          as associated GAPs and other interactors, including
          Rdi1p, Rga1p, and Gic2p. Other included network elements
          are Fks1p, the 1,3-βglucan synthase of which Rho1p is a
          subunit [ 16 ] , the actin protein Act1p, and the
          proteins Bni1p, Bud6p, and Sph1p, which are associated
          with Rho-mediated signal transduction, actin filament
          organization, cell polarity establishment, and bud
          growth. Smd3p forms a complex with the Sm core
          spliceosomal proteins [ 17 ] , and we are not aware of
          any role it may play in maintaining cell wall integrity.
          Its inclusion is most likely a result of its expression
          correlation with 
          BUD6 in one of the microarray
          datasets, but it seems unlikely that the observed
          interactions of Smd3p with Spa2p and Slt2p have
          biological significance. In the NetSearch-generated
          model, Bck1p is downstream of Mkk1p because, although it
          interacts with both Mkk1p and Mkk2p, it has been shown
          specifically not to interact with Pkc1p in two-hybrid
          assays [ 18 ] .
          The network model for filamentous growth (Fig. 4D)
          involves 21 proteins, 20 of which are known to play a
          role in filamentous growth, or have functions consistent
          with that role, with the exception of Fus1p. As in the
          pheromone response and cell wall integrity network
          models, key components of the Ras GTPase are included,
          such as Cdc25p (the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange
          factor), Cyr1p (the Ras-associated adenylate cyclase),
          and Srv2p, which enables the activation of adenylate
          cyclase by Ras2p. Several proteins with roles in actin
          filament organization, cell polarity establishment, bud
          growth, and GTPase-mediated signal transduction are
          shared with the cell wall integrity pathway, including
          Bni1p, Spa2p, Bud6p, and Act1p. NetSearch depicts
          interactions between Abp1p and both Srv2p and Act1p,
          consistent with the function of Abp1 in tethering Srv2p
          to the cytoskeleton. The adenylate cyclase and associated
          proteins mentioned above, along with Hsp82p and Hsc82p,
          activate the cAMP pathway [ 19 ] , a pathway that acts in
          parallel with the MAPK pathway to promote filamentation.
          Hsp82p is a chaperone protein known to interact with a
          number of signaling pathway components [ 20 ] . It is
          required for activation of the pheromone signaling
          pathway [ 21 ] , and for the general response to amino
          acid starvation [ 22 ] . It may play a similar role in
          response to nitrogen (ammonia) starvation, a trigger for
          filamentation. Fus1p, included in our predicted network,
          does not have a documented role in filamentation; it is
          required for cell fusion during pheromone initiated
          mating. Its transcript levels are significantly
          upregulated in response to pheromone, but are unchanged
          in 
          tec1Δ strains [ 6 ] ; that study
          notes, however, that in 
          dig1Δ dig2Δ cells, fus1 is
          constitutively activated, and both mating and invasive
          growth are observed. Tec1p, conspicuously absent in our
          model, has not been observed to interact with any
          proteins in high-throughput two-hybrid screens.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The utility of yeast protein-protein interaction maps
        for generating signaling network models has previously been
        suggested [ 23 ] , and they have been used to predict
        metabolic pathways [ 24 ] . Expression data has been used
        to generate and refine models for genetic regulatory
        networks without the benefit of protein-protein interaction
        data [ 25 ] . In this study, we have used expression data
        to rank candidate pathways of interacting proteins. This
        approach has a strong biological and experimental
        rationale: proteins used in the same signaling network must
        exist simultaneously with its activation. The genes
        encoding these proteins must be transcribed at
        approximately the same time, and under the same
        environmental conditions in which the signaling network is
        required. Furthermore, experimental evidence suggests that
        when a signaling network is activated, positive feedback
        mechanisms upregulate the expression of genes that encode
        pathway proteins [ 26 ] , implying that this rationale is
        also applicable to "surveillance" pathways, whose protein
        components may need to be constitutively present in small
        quantities, but whose concentration increases with
        activation. This biological rationale is borne out by
        evidence that interacting proteins have more highly
        correlated expression profiles than do non-interacting
        proteins [ 27 ] . However, if a single component of a
        signaling network is independently (and differentially)
        regulated, it would not necessarily be excluded using our
        approach, if for instance, it connected two halves of a
        pathway which had similar average expression profiles.
        NetSearch can be used to predict new signaling pathways,
        identify previously unknown members of documented pathways,
        or identify smaller clusters of interacting proteins. Until
        we have a more complete protein-interaction set, a user who
        wishes to explore a particular pathway
        http://arep.med.harvard.edu/NetSearchneeds to specify
        pathway starting points and ending points (such as membrane
        and DNA-binding proteins, respectively). This selection can
        be based on a known genetic interaction, a shared mutant
        phenotype, a shared functional classification, or signature
        expression profile. This is the approach we have followed
        in constructing the networks depicted in Fig. 4. Those
        networks are comprised of all highest ranking linear paths
        connecting the receptors and transcription factors for that
        pathway.
        The pheromone response pathway is commonly depicted as a
        simple, linear transmission of the mating signal from the
        membrane receptor, Ste2p (for alpha-factor) or Ste3p (for
        a-factor), to the nuclear effectors, Ste12p and Mcm1p, via
        a MAPK cascade. However, mating pheromone exposure also
        induces other cellular processes such as those required for
        polarized growth, cell cycle arrest, and recovery from cell
        cycle arrest. Furthermore, the topology of the protein
        interactions required for these processes is considerably
        more complicated than a series of pairwise interactions. In
        addition to accurately depicting the MAPK cascade, our
        predicted pheromone response network identifies many
        proteins necessary to execute the coordinated processes of
        growth polarization and cell cycle arrest, and reflects the
        complex topology of the interaction network.
        The complexity of these interactions are observed in
        large, multifunctional complexes of possibly dynamic
        composition. For example, products of Ste18, Ste4, Cdc42,
        Cdc24, Far1, Bem1, Ste20, Ste5, and other proteins are
        thought to constitute a complex that has numerous
        interactions among components, and that mediates many
        different cellular processes [ 14 28 ] . The complex may
        coordinate mating pheromone detection with (1) cell cycle
        arrest via Far1p, (2) MAPK signal transduction via Ste5p
        and Ste20p, and (3) cell polarity via Bem1p and Far1p
        (among others) [ 29 30 ] .
        Given that several of these networks share components of
        the MAPK cascade, the mechanism by which input-output
        specificity is maintained remains one of the most important
        questions in the field of molecular signal transduction.
        One well accepted hypothesis is that scaffolding proteins
        such as Ste5p and Pbs2p tether the MAPK module to the
        appropriate input and output components [ 31 ] . The recent
        identification of numerous Ste5p analogs in yeast and
        mammals makes this hypothesis even more intriguing [ 26 ] .
        Beyond scaffolding proteins, higher-order protein complexes
        have been hypothesized to play a role in maintaining signal
        specificity [ 32 ] . Our computational results suggest that
        this may indeed be the case. When comparing the minimal
        pathways for pheromone response and filamentation as
        depicted in Fig. 1, it appears that maintaining signal
        specificity would be a considerable challenge. But when
        comparing the two network predictions depicted in Fig. 4,
        one notes many differences, all of which may help ensure
        specificity. The network perspective suggests not a single
        scaffolding protein, but many scaffolding proteins - in
        fact, a "scaffolding network." The possibility exists that
        relatively nonspecific kinases function simply as
        "phosphorylation modules," operating inside insulating
        networks that are the primary determinant of signaling
        specificity.
        Because our protein-protein interaction data is only a
        small fraction of a truly complete interaction map, one
        finds portions of a network that cannot be connected using
        available protein-protein interaction data. This was the
        case in our attempts to model the HOG network. While
        NetSearch correctly identified the upstream elements of
        this pathway (Sln1p → Ypd1p → Ssk1p → Ssk22p), it was
        unable to form any connections to Pbs2p or Hog1p that ended
        in a transcription factor. In some cases, a missing
        interaction can be circumvented, however. In the model for
        the pheromone response network, NetSearch inserted Akr1p, a
        known inhibitor of the pheromone pathway [ 15 ] , between
        Ste3p and the G protein complex (Ste4p/Ste18p/Gpa1p).
        Although the protein-interaction dataset we used contained
        no direct interaction between Ste2p/Ste3p and Ste4p,
        Ste2p-Ste4p has been shown to interact in a targeted yeast
        two-hybrid study [ 33 ] .
        Our failure to model the HOG pathway underscores the
        fact that, for the purposes of this algorithm, missing
        interactions (false-negatives) are a more significant
        obstacle than are false-positive interactions. Missing
        interactions cannot be "created" by the algorithm, but
        false-positive interactions are de-emphasized as a result
        of the bias imposed by ranking paths according to the
        similarity of expression profiles. Bearing this out, of the
        fifty-eight proteins included in our networks, only Smd3p
        seems to be included as a result of false-positive
        interactions. (This is distinct from the case of Fus1p,
        which may be misplaced in the filamentation pathway, but
        whose interactions with Act1p and Ste7p are real.) This
        highlights a general observation on the integration of
        genomic technologies. Two-hybrid and microarray expression
        studies are both known to have a sizable fraction of
        systematic errors (for instance, self-activators in
        two-hybrid experiments, and cross-hybridization in
        microarrays), but when looking at the intersection of the
        two, the true signals tend to reinforce one another,
        whereas the systematic errors in the two tend to be
        different and are reduced further into the noise. These
        effects may help explain why we observe so few
        false-positive proteins inserted into our predicted
        networks.
        In addition to using more complete interaction datasets,
        such as those found in Ho [ 35 ] and Gavin [ 36 ] , one
        could improve this approach by integrating more types of
        data. Homology modelling could be used to differentially
        weight the inclusion of molecules likely to be involved in
        signal transduction (e.g. kinases), and genetic
        interactions could weight the inclusion of the two proteins
        in the same path. Signaling motif identification [ 36 ] and
        data from protein kinase chips [ 37 ] could also easily be
        incorporated into this framework. Based on the interaction
        data available, the networks depicted in Fig. 4are static,
        with all interactions given equal weight, and without
        information on the direction of information transfer. In
        reality, signaling networks are dynamic and vectorial
        complexes, with interactions of varying strengths among
        component proteins [ 38 ] . The technology necessary to
        generate data which will allow modelling of these network
        properties are beginning to emerge. Kinase chips [ 37 ]
        will allow one to incorporate information about the
        direction of information flow. The strength of protein
        interactions (with DNA) has been measured on chips in a
        highly parallel manner [ 39 ] and the same could be done
        for protein-protein interactions [ 40 ] . Data on the
        spatial and temporal co-localization of signaling
        components is being generated by new imaging techniques [
        41 ] , which will yield insight into the mechanism with
        which the cellular response to a signal is modulated by the
        intensity and the duration of the signal [ 42 ] , and the
        interplay with parallel pathways.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The approach we have presented allows one to query the
        intersection of two enormous sets of functional
        genomic-derived molecular data. One can, in effect,
        simultaneously browse protein-protein interaction and gene
        expression data. It allows one to extract a group of
        highly-connected, highly-correlated proteins from global
        data to isolate a sub-network of particular interest.
        Significantly, this approach does not require prior
        knowledge of pathway intermediates. The interaction data
        determines the pathways that are considered, and gene
        expression data is used to rank the pathways. Although we
        have focused on signaling pathways, this approach should be
        applicable to modelling the relationships among any group
        of interacting proteins that cooperate to perform a given
        function within a cell, and the web-version of the software
        allows for these queries. As many genomic techniques are
        generating increasingly large amounts of molecular data,
        new tools such as this will be required for the synthesis
        of "parts into pathways" in order that we may understand
        how cells regulate the many processes necessary for growth
        and development.
