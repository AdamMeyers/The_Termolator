        c-fos is a member of the family of
        immediate early genes, and its transcription is transiently
        induced in response to mitogenic signals [ 1]. The serum
        response element (SRE) is located approximately 300 bp
        upstream of the transcriptional start site in the 
        c-fos promoter and is necessary for
        serum induction of 
        c-fos [ 2]. The SRE binds a
        transcription factor named serum response factor (SRF)
        which was found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for
        serum induction of the SRE [ 3, 4, 5]. 
        In vivo footprinting analysis shows
        that SRF is constitutively bound to the SRE in both
        quiescent and growth factor stimulated cells [ 6]. This
        suggests that it is the transcriptional activation of a
        complex of SRF and its accessory proteins that is regulated
        rather than regulation of SRF DNA binding.
        The ternary complex factors (TCFs) are members of the
        ets family of transcription factors. The TCF family members
        Elk-1 [ 7], SAP-1 [ 8], and SAP-2/ERP/NET [ 9, 10] have
        been found to have a role in regulating the SRE. TCFs
        cannot bind the SRE autonomously, but require
        protein-protein interactions with SRF in order to bind the
        SRE [ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The TCFs contain 3 conserved
        motifs termed the A, B, and C boxes [ 16]. The N-terminal
        A-box (amino acids (aa) 1-90 of Elk-1) is necessary to bind
        DNA, while the central B-box (aa 148-168) is the SRF
        interaction domain. The C-terminal C-box (aa 352-399),
        harboring the transactivation domain, contains several
        consensus mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
        phosphorylation sites. Accordingly, the TCFs have been
        found to be targets of the Ras-Raf-MAPK signal transduction
        pathway [ 16]. In addition, the TCFs have been found to be
        targets for all three families of MAPKs: the extracellular
        signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), the jun-N-terminal
        kinases/stress activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPK), and
        the p38 kinase [ 17, 18]. The transcriptional activity of
        the TCFs are stimulated by phosphorylation of the
        C-terminal MAPK sites [ 16, 17].
        Another transcription factor that is involved in
        regulation of the 
        c-fos SRE is CCAAT/Enhancer binding
        protein-beta (C/EBPβ). C/EBPβ (also known as NF-IL6, LAP,
        NF-M, AGP/EBP, and CRP2) is a member of the basic-leucine
        zipper family of transcription factors [ 19, 20]. The
        C/EBPβ mRNA contains three in-frame methionines which give
        rise to three different translation products: p38, p35, and
        p20-C/EBPβ [ 21]. p38 and p35-C/EBPβ both contain an
        N-terminal transactivation domain and a C-terminal DNA
        binding/dimerization domain. p20-C/EBPβ lacks the
        N-terminal transactivation domain and therefore acts as a
        repressor of transcription. Our lab has previously shown
        that p35-C/EBPβ activates an SRE-driven reporter construct
        while p20-C/EBPβ inhibits serum stimulation of the same
        reporter [ 22]. We have also shown that both p35-C/EBPβ and
        p20-C/EBPβ could interact with SRF 
        in vivo and that the interaction
        between SRF and p35-C/EBPβ, but not between SRF and
        p20-C/EBPβ, is stimulated by activated Ras. The target for
        this Ras stimulation is Thr235 in a consensus MAPK site in
        C/EBPβ [ 23]. Therefore, C/EBPβ is a target of a
        Ras-dependent signaling pathway that regulates its
        interaction with SRF.
        Based on the observations that TCF factors as well as
        p35-C/EBPβ: (1) interact with SRF (2) transactivate the SRE
        and (3) are responsive to Ras-dependent signaling pathways,
        we tested the possibility that both TCF and p35-C/EBPβ are
        necessary for maximal induction of the SRE in response to
        mitogenic stimulation. In this study, we show that
        p35-C/EBPβ and the TCF family member Elk-1 synergize in
        transactivation of SRF dependent transcription of both a
        Gal4 dependent reporter and an SRE-driven reporter
        construct, but only in response to mitogenic stimulation by
        Ras. We further show that Elk-1 and p35-C/EBPβ interact 
        in vitro in a
        glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-pulldown assay as well as
        in an 
        in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assay.
        The 
        in vivo interaction is dependent on
        the presence of activated Ras. Finally, we show that the
        C-terminal domain of C/EBPβ is sufficient to interact with
        Elk-1 while the N-terminal A-box of Elk-1 is necessary to
        interact with C/EBPβ. These results suggest a cooperative
        role between the TCF and C/EBPβ transcription factors in
        regulation of the 
        c-fos SRE in response to
        Ras-dependent signaling pathways.
      
      
        Results
        
          Elk-1 and p35-C/EBPβ synergize in transactivation
          of a GAL4 dependent reporter
          Due to the common observations that both Elk-1 and
          p35-C/EBPβ transactivate the SRE, interact with SRF, and
          are responsive to Ras-dependent signaling pathways, we
          hypothesized that Elk-1 and p35-C/EBPβ may both be
          necessary for maximal induction of SRF dependent
          transcription. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used
          a GAL4 dependent reporter construct, in which a CAT
          reporter gene is driven by five copies of a GAL4 binding
          site upstream of the adenovirus E1B minimal promoter
          (pG5CAT). We constructed a GAL4 DNA binding domain-SRF
          fusion protein, as has been described previously [ 23].
          GAL4-SRF binds to the GAL4 reporter construct, thereby
          making transcription of the reporter gene dependent on
          the presence of SRF. As shown in Fig. 1, when a GAL4-SRF
          fusion construct is transfected with the reporter, there
          is no increase in CAT activity. The SRF transactivation
          domain is weak, as has been shown previously [ 24]. When
          CMV-Elk-1 is cotransfected with the reporter and
          GAL4-SRF, there is little increase in CAT activity in the
          absence of activated Ras (CMV-Ras.V12). This result is
          expected since the transactivation domain of Elk-1 is
          activated in response to Ras. Therefore, when activated
          Ras is transfected with Elk-1, GAL4-SRF, and the
          reporter, the CAT activity increases to 8-fold over basal
          levels. We cannot determine if the increase in CAT
          activity in the presence of Ras also reflects a
          stimulation of the interaction of the Elk-1 and SRF
          proteins.
          When CMV-LAP (which encodes p35-C/EBPβ) is transfected
          with GAL4-SRF and the reporter construct, we see a 7-fold
          increase in CAT activity that is potentiated to 75-fold
          when activated Ras is cotransfected. Therefore, C/EBPβ
          results in a much larger increase in transcription than
          Elk-1. We have previously shown that Ras does not
          activate the transactivation domain of p35-C/EBPβ [ 23].
          Thus, the increase in transcription in this assay is due
          to Ras stimulation of the SRF-p35-C/EBPβ interaction.
          Interestingly, when all three constructs - SRF, Elk-1,
          and p35-C/EBPβ-are cotransfected with the reporter
          construct, there is an average 260-fold increase in CAT
          activity in the presence of activated Ras. The values of
          fold activation varied from as low as 60-fold to as high
          as 725-fold over basal levels, and we are unsure of the
          reason for this variability. However, regardless of the
          extent of activation, in every experiment there was a
          synergy observed when both Elk-1 and p35-C/EBPβ are
          transfected in the presence of Ras. There is only a
          slight increase in CAT activity in the absence of Ras.
          Therefore, Elk-1 and p35-C/EBPβ are working
          synergistically to transactivate the reporter construct
          in the presence of SRF. This synergism is only observed
          in response to activation of mitogenic signaling pathways
          by Ras.
        
        
          Elk-1 and p35-C/EBPβ synergize in transactivation
          of the SRE
          Since Elk-1 and p35-C/EBPβ synergize in
          transactivation of SRF-dependent transcription using a
          GAL4-dependent promoter, we next tested if Elk-1 and
          p35-C/EBPβ could also synergize in transactivation of a
          native SRF binding site, namely the 
          c-fos SRE. To test this
          possibility, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected
          with a CAT reporter gene driven by one copy of the wild
          type SRE upstream of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal
          repeat minimal promoter. As shown in Fig. 2, when
          p35-C/EBPβ is co-transfected with the reporter construct,
          there is a 13-fold increase in CAT activity in the
          absence of activated Ras that is increased to 24-fold
          when CMV-Ras.V12 is co-transfected.
          When CMV-Elk-1 is co-transfected with the SRE reporter
          construct, there is no additional stimulation in
          transactivation in either the absence or presence of Ras
          compared to the reporter alone. However, when both Elk-1
          and p35-C/EBPβ are transfected with the SRE reporter
          construct, there is a synergistic effect in
          transactivation of the SRE, with a 72-fold increase in
          CAT activity over reporter construct alone. As was seen
          with the Gal4 reporter, this synergism is only observed
          in the presence of activated Ras. These data suggest that
          both Elk-1 and p35-C/EBPβ are necessary for maximal
          Ras-stimulated transactivation of the SRE.
        
        
          The TCF family member Elk-1 and C/EBPβ interact in
          vitro
          We next tested the possibility that there could be a
          direct protein-protein interaction between Elk-1 and
          p35-C/EBPβ based on the fact that they synergize in
          transactivation of the SRE. Therefore, we used a
          GST-pulldown assay to determine if the proteins could
          interact 
          in vitro . p35-C/EBPβ was expressed
          as a chimeric GST protein and immobilized on
          glutathione-agarose beads. Beads containing
          GST-p35-C/EBPβ or GST alone were incubated with 
          in vitro -translated Elk-1 labeled
          with [ 35S] methionine. As shown in Fig. 3, lane 2,
          approximately 35-45% of the input Elk-1 was retained on
          the GST-p35-C/EBPβ beads. A small amount of Elk-1 bound
          to the beads containing GST alone (Fig. 3, lane 3) which
          we have been unable to eliminate even after blocking with
          unprogrammed translation lysate. However, it is clear
          that the binding of Elk-1 is substantially increased when
          the GST-p35-C/EBPβ fusion protein is present on the
          beads. These data indicate that Elk-1 and p35-C/EBPβ are
          capable of interacting 
          in vitro .
        
        
          Elk-1 and p35-C/EBPβ interact in vivo, but only in
          the presence of activated Ras
          Since we observed an 
          in vitro interaction between the
          Elk-1 and C/EBPβ proteins, we next tested whether the
          proteins could interact 
          in vivo as well. To do this, we
          used a co-immunoprecipitation approach. COS-7 cells were
          transfected with an expression vector for a 6X histidine
          tagged construct of p35-C/EBPβ carrying the φ 10 (T7 tag)
          epitope sequence either in the presence or absence of
          Elk-1. Cell lysates were incubated with T7 tag Ab agarose
          beads followed by immunoblotting of the precipitated
          proteins with Elk-1 Ab. As shown in Fig. 4, there is no
          Elk-1 protein precipitated with the tagged C/EBPβ protein
          when both are transfected (lane 5). However, since the
          synergism of Elk-1 and p35-C/EBPβ is observed when
          activated Ras is present, we thought it likely that the
          interaction between the two proteins could be
          Ras-dependent. Indeed, when activated Ras is
          co-transfected along with Elk-1 and histidine-tagged
          p35-C/EBPβ, the Elk-1 protein is precipitated with the
          p35-C/EBPβ (lane 6). One possible explanation for this
          result is that Ras increases the amount of p35-C/EBPβ or
          Elk-1 protein in the COS-7 cells, but Western blot
          analysis showed that both p35-C/EBPβ and Elk-1 protein
          levels are the same in the absence and presence of Ras
          (data not shown). Therefore, p35-C/EBPβ and Elk-1
          interact in 
          vivo , but only in response to
          activation of Ras-dependent signaling pathways.
        
        
          The C-terminal domain of C/EBPβ is necessary to
          interact with Elk-1 in vitro
          Since C/EBPβ and Elk-1 interact, we next wanted to
          narrow down the domains of the proteins that are required
          for their interaction. To determine the domain of C/EBPβ
          that is necessary to interact with Elk-1, a
          p20-C/EBPβ-GST fusion protein was constructed. p20-C/EBPβ
          encodes the 20 kDa form of C/EBPβ, which lacks the
          N-terminal transactivation domain of the longer
          p35-C/EBPβ isoform. This isoform, however, shares the
          C-terminal DNA binding and dimerization domain with
          p35-C/EBPβ. As shown in Fig. 5, approximately the same
          amount of [ 35S]-labeled Elk-1 is retained on both the
          GST-p20-C/EBPβ and GST-p35-C/EBPβ beads (compare lanes 2
          and 3). Therefore, deletion of the N-terminus of C/EBPβ
          has no effect on its ability to interact with Elk-1. This
          data demonstrates that the C-terminal region of C/EBPβ is
          sufficient to mediate interaction with Elk-1 
          in vitro .
        
        
          The N-terminal A-box of Elk-1 is sufficient to
          interact with C/EBPβ in vitro
          In order to narrow down the domain of Elk-1 that is
          necessary to interact with C/EBPβ 
          in vitro , we made several Elk-1
          deletion mutants (Fig. 6A) and tested these constructs in
          a pulldown assay with GST-p35-C/EBPβ. Elk-1(1-209) is a
          C-terminal deletion mutant that lacks the C-box.
          Elk-1(1-140) is also a C-terminal deletion, but it lacks
          both the B- and C-boxes. Therefore, this mutant contains
          neither a transactivation domain nor an SRF binding
          domain. Finally, Elk-1(89-428) is a deletion of the
          N-terminal A-box. Glutathione agarose beads containing
          GST-p35-C/EBPβ or GST alone were incubated with 
          in vitro -translated Elk-1 mutants
          labeled with [ 35S] methionine. As shown in Fig. 6B, the
          C-terminal Elk-1 mutants, Elk-1(1-209) and Elk-1(1-140),
          bound to the GST-p35-C/EBPβ beads to the same extent as
          wild-type Elk-1 (compare lane 3 of top 3 panels).
          However, the A-box deletion mutant, Elk-1(89-428), no
          longer binds to the GST-p35-C/EBPβ (lane 3, bottom
          panel). Therefore, this data demonstrates that the A-box
          of Elk-1 is necessary to interact with C/EBPβ 
          in vitro .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have shown that the transcription factors Elk-1 and
        p35-C/EBPβ synergize in transactivation of SRF-dependent
        transcription using both GAL4 and SRE-driven reporter
        constructs. Interestingly, this synergy is only observed in
        response to mitogenic stimulation by Ras. We have also
        demonstrated that the Elk-1 and p35-C/EBPβ proteins
        interact using both 
        in vitro GST-pulldown and 
        in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays.
        The 
        in vivo interaction, however, is
        dependent on the presence of activated Ras. Finally, we
        demonstrate that the 
        in vitro interaction domains of the
        two proteins are the C-terminal domain of C/EBPβ and the
        N-terminal domain of Elk-1.
        These results suggest a new mechanism for
        transactivation of the SRE, where a competent
        transcriptional complex consisting of at least SRF, TCF,
        and p35-C/EBPβ participate in transactivation in response
        to Ras. To this point, the TCF family members have been
        thought to be the main targets of Ras signaling to the SRE,
        and activation of TCF by Ras has been shown to result in
        transactivation of the SRE [ 16]. However, we show that Ras
        activation of TCF alone does not result in maximal SRE
        transactivation, but instead, is greatly enhanced in the
        presence of p35-C/EBPβ.
        SRF and TCF have been shown to form a ternary complex at
        the SRE 
        in vitro . We as yet have not been
        able to observe a ternary complex between SRF and
        p35-C/EBPβ at the SRE 
        in vitro . The mechanisms of SRE
        transactivation described above may help to explain the 
        in vitro results. The C/EBPβ
        recognition site in the SRE is a weak binding site [ 25].
        Upon activation of Ras-dependent signaling pathways, the
        presence of p35-C/EBPβ at the SRE would be stabilized due
        to its strong protein-protein interactions not only with
        SRF, as we have shown previously [ 23], but also with
        Elk-1. It is possible that p35-C/EBPβ and SRF are not
        sufficient to form a ternary complex with the SRE 
        in vitro , but Elk-1 may also be
        necessary. In addition, it is likely that p35-C/EBPβ,
        Elk-1, or both, may need to be activated by one or more
        MAPK family members for a multiprotein complex to form with
        SRF at the SRE. Further studies utilizing the information
        from the 
        in vivo studies performed here may
        permit us to optimize the 
        in vitro conditions necessary to
        observe such a multiprotein complex.
        We observe a direct interaction between C/EBPβ and Elk-1
        in a GST pulldown assay. Another ets family member, Ets-1,
        has previously been shown to interact with C/EBPβ 
        in vitro [ 26]. We have not directly
        tested the ability of the other TCF famlily members, SAP1
        and SAP2/ERP/NET, to interact with C/EBPβ. We find that the
        domain of Elk-1 that interacts with C/EBPβ is the ets
        domain, which is conserved among the other TCF family
        members [ 16]. We would therefore also expect SAP1 and
        SAP2/ERP/NET to interact with C/EBPβ. Interestingly, the 
        in vivo interaction of Elk-1 and
        C/EBPβ is dependent on activation of Ras-dependent
        signaling pathways. The target(s) of the Ras signaling
        pathway is as yet unknown. It has been shown that
        transfection of activated Ras results in phosphorylation of
        Thr235 (numbering for human protein) in the C-terminal
        domain of C/EBPβ, and that Thr235 could be phosphorylated
        by a partially purified MAPK preparation 
        in vitro [ 19]. We have also shown
        that this same residue is necessary for Ras stimultion of
        the interaction between C/EBPβ and SRF. Therefore, it will
        be interesting to determine if this site is also critical
        for stimulation of the interaction between C/EBPβ and
        Elk-1. Elk-1 also has several MAPK sites in its C-terminal
        domain, and therefore this region could also be a target
        for Ras.
        We are currently investigating the mechanism of the
        observed synergy between Elk-1 and p35-C/EBPβ. We have
        shown that C/EBPβ interacts with the A-box of Elk-1, while
        SRF has previously been shown to interact with the B-box [
        16]. Therefore, C/EBPβ and SRF interact with two distinct
        domains of Elk-1, as well as with each other, which could
        allow formation of a complex of the three transcription
        factors. This would create an active transcriptional
        complex at the SRE and result in enhanced transactivation.
        It is possible that the p35-C/EBPβ-SRF-Elk-1 complex could
        interact more strongly with coactivators and/or the basal
        transcriptional machinery than each individual
        transcription factor. It has been shown that SRF, TCF, and
        C/EBPβ can all interact with components of transcriptional
        machinery such as p300/CBP, SRC-1, and TFII-I [ 27, 28, 29,
        30]. There is most likely a large protein complex assembled
        at the SRE composed of regulated transcription factors,
        coactivators, and the basal transcriptional machinery,
        resulting in rapid transcription of the 
        c-fos gene in response to mitogenic
        stimulation.
      
      
        Conclusions
        This report demonstrates a new model for 
        c-fos SRE activation in response to
        Ras-dependent signaling pathways. We show that SRF, Elk-1,
        and p35-C/EBPβ are all necessary for maximal Ras-stimulated
        transactivation of the SRE.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Cell Culture and Transfections
          NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (from the American Type Culture
          Collection) and COS-7 cells (kindly provided by Dr. S.
          Hann, Vanderbilt University) were grown in Dulbecco's
          Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% calf serum
          (Colorado Serum Company), 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, 4 mM
          L-glutamine, 25 U of penicillin G sodium per mL, and 25
          mg of streptomycin per mL.
          COS-7 cell transfections were performed by the calcium
          phosphate (CaPO 
          4 ) technique [ 31]. Cells at 60-70%
          confluence were exposed to the CaPO 
          4 -DNA precipitate for 8 h. The medium
          was removed and replaced with complete medium for 36 h
          before harvesting. NIH 3T3 transfections were performed
          using NovaFector (Venn Nova) or Trans-IT LT1 (PanVera) as
          described by the manufacturers.
          For NovaFector transfections, a 6:1 ratio of
          NovaFector:DNA was used for each transfection. Cells at
          60-70% confluence were exposed to the NovaFector:DNA
          complex for 6-7 h in serum and antibiotic free medium.
          After the incubation, an equal volume of DMEM containing
          20% calf serum was added for 24 h, bringing the final
          concentration of calf serum to 10%. Cells were then serum
          deprived for 36-40 h in DMEM supplemented as above except
          containing 0.5% calf serum before harvesting. For
          TransIT-LT1 transfections, a 6:1 ratio of TransIT-LT1:DNA
          was used in each transfection. Cells at 60-70% confluence
          were exposed to the TransIT-LT1:DNA complex for 8 h in
          complete medium plus freshly added 30 mg/mL polymyxin B
          antibiotic [ 32]. The medium was then removed and
          replaced with complete medium for 24 h. Cells were then
          serum deprived in DMEM containing 0.5% calf serum for
          36-40 h before harvesting. Cell extracts were prepared
          and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assays were
          performed on extracts containing equivalent cell protein
          as previously described [ 33]. An internal control
          plasmid to measure transfection efficiency could not be
          used because C/EBPβ regulates transcrption from the
          control plasmid, and thus makes the internal control
          invalid. Therefore, the transfections were repeated
          multiple times to control for variability in transfection
          efficiency.
        
        
          Plasmids
          The pGAL4 and pG5CAT plasmids were obtained from the
          Mammalian MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid Assay Kit (CLONTECH).
          pGAL4-SRF was constructed as previously described [ 23].
          The SRE-CAT reporter gene was constructed as previously
          described [ 22]. pGST-p35-C/EBPβ was constructed by
          inserting the 1,739 bp EcoRI fragment from pRSETB-EFII [
          34] into EcoRI cut pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham-Pharmacia).
          pGST-p20-C/EBPβ was constructed by inserting the 581 bp
          BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pRsetA-LIP [ 34] into similarly
          digested pGEX4T-1. pcDNA3/Elk-1(1-209) and
          pcDNA3/Elk-1(1-140) were constructed by using the
          Erase-A-Base system (Promega) with pcDNA3/Elk-1 (gift of
          J. Schwartz, Univ. of Michigan) as described by the
          manufacturer. pcDNA3.1/His-p35-C/EBPβ was constructed by
          inserting an 1,739 bp EcoRI fragment from pRSETB-EFII
          into an EcoRI cut pcDNA3.1/HisC vector (Invitrogen).
          CMV-LAP was a gift of U. Schibler (Univ. of Geneva,
          Geneva, Switzerland) and CMV-Ras.V12 was a gift of E.
          Ruley (Vanderbilt Univ.).
        
        
          Analysis of ELK-1 and C/EBPβ interaction in
          vitro
          GST-p35-C/EBPβ, GST-p20-C/EBPβ, or GST alone was
          produced in BL21 E. Coli by 80 mM
          isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction
          overnight at 37°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation
          and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
          containing the following protease inhibitors: 2 mg/ml
          aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
          fluoride (PMSF), and 0.2 mM pepstatin. The bacteria were
          lysed by sonication at 4 oC in PBS containing the
          protease inhibitors described above. Triton X-100 was
          added to a final concentration of 0.1%, followed by
          gentle mixing for 30 min at 4°C. The lysate was clarified
          at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was
          gently mixed with glutathione-sepharose beads
          (Amersham-Pharmacia) at 4°C for 30 min. Beads containing
          GST proteins were collected by low speed centrifugation,
          followed by three successive washes with PBS containing
          0.1% Triton X-100 and the protease inhibitors described
          above.
          The ELK-1, ELK-1(1-209), ELK-1(1-140), and
          ELK-1(89-428) proteins were transcribed and translated in
          vitro using the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system
          (Promega) according to the manufacture's instructions.
          Translated proteins were radiolabeled with the EXPRE 35S
          35S protein labeling mix (Dupont NEN). The GST-pulldown
          assay was done as previously described [ 22].
        
        
          Co-Immunoprecipitation
          COS-7 cells were harvested in PBS containing 0.1 mM
          sodium vanadate and collected by low speed
          centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer
          (10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 0.25%
          Nonidet P-40, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mg of aprotinin/mL, 0.1 mM
          sodium vanadate, 10 mM sodium molybdate, and 10 mM
          β-glycerol phosphate) and lysed by sonication with a
          microtip on setting 2 and 20% duty cycle for 10 s. After
          clarification by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min,
          the cell extract was incubated with T7 tag antibody
          (Ab)-agarose beads (Novagen) for 2 h. The beads were
          collected by low speed centrifugation and washed 3 times
          with lysis buffer. All steps were performed at 4°C. After
          washing, the beads were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli
          sample buffer.
        
        
          Immunoblots
          The samples from the coimmunoprecipitations described
          above were analyzed by electrophoresis on an SDS-12%
          polyacrylamide gel for 3 h at 160 V. The gel was
          equilibrated in transfer buffer (33 mM Tris base, 192 mM
          glycine, 20% methanol) for 15 min before transfer of
          proteins to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.). After
          transfer, an immunoblot was performed as described
          previously [ 22]. A 1:2000 dilution of anti-Elk-1 Ab
          (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a 1:5000 dilution of goat
          anti-rabbit secondary Ab (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)
          were used. The secondary Ab was detected using
          SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce).
