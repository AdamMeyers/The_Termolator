        Wound healing involves reepithelialization, granulation
        tissue formation and contraction (reviewed in refs. [ 1 2 ]
        ). Reepithelialization and granulation tissue formation in
        turn involve proliferation and migration of cells from the
        wound edge to fill the wound site. In higher vertebrate
        adult animals, reepithelialization of a wound begins within
        hours after injury while granulation tissue begins to form
        approximately 4 days after injury. Besides fibroblasts,
        granulation tissue consists of macrophages, blood vessels,
        and extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by fibroblasts.
        Once the wound is filled with granulation tissue and
        covered with a neoepidermis, a portion of the wound
        fibroblasts transforms into myofibroblasts, which contract
        the wound to reduce and strengthen the defect.
        Myofibroblasts are rich in F-actin bundles, which establish
        cell-cell and cell-matrix linkages and thus generate the
        force for wound contraction.
        SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) is
        an extracellular glycoprotein expressed in elevated levels
        in actively proliferating cells and organs such as
        developing embryos and adult tissues associated with
        remodeling (bone and gut), wound healing, angiogenesis
        (reviewed in refs. [ 3 4 ] ), and tumorigenesis [ 5 6 ] .
        SPARC belongs to a class of recently denoted matricellular
        proteins that are involved in cell-ECM interactions. It
        binds to ECM proteins and interacts with cells. SPARC has
        been postulated to modulate cell shape [ 3 4 ] and cell
        adhesions [ 4 7 8 ] , to regulate cell proliferation [ 3 4
        ] and migration [ 9 10 ] , and to influence matrix
        contraction [ 11 ] . In addition, SPARC is known to bind to
        certain growth factors [ 12 ] and to modulate expression of
        ECM components [ 13 ] . Many of these functions are
        requisite to wound repair.
        To further investigate the role of SPARC in wound
        healing, we used cells from our recently generated
        SPARC-null mice [ 14 ] . As we reported previously SPARC
        plays a role in regulating expression of growth factors,
        growth factor receptors, and ECM proteins and in modulating
        cell proliferation. In the absence of SPARC, expression of
        transforming growth factor-Î²1 and type I collagen is
        down-regulated in kidney mesangial cells [ 15 ] . The
        expression of cell surface receptor for insulin-like growth
        factor I in SPARC-null embryonic fibroblasts is also
        diminished [ 16 ] . Studies with SPARC-null cells have
        confirmed that SPARC functions in cell proliferation.
        Mesangial cells, adult skin fibroblasts and smooth muscle
        cells from SPARC-null mice proliferate faster than their
        respective wild-type counterparts in media containing fetal
        bovine serum (FBS) [ 17 ] . Although embryonic fibroblasts
        from the SPARC-null mice grow at the same rate as the
        wild-type cells when they are cultured in FBS, the
        SPARC-null embryonic fibroblasts exhibit down-regulated
        proliferation as compared to the wild-type cells when the
        fibroblasts are cultured in serum-free medium containing
        insulin as the sole mitogenic factor [ 16 ] . Thus, it
        appears that the role of SPARC in cell proliferation is
        cell type and environment dependent.
        Although SPARC is expressed in fibroblasts and
        macrophages at wound sites [ 18 ] and functions in many
        processes important to wound repair, the role of SPARC in
        wound healing in a whole animal has not yet been studied.
        Previously, studies of phenotypes in this laboratory have
        shown that SPARC-null mice develop osteopenia around 2.5
        months of age [ 19 ] in bones where SPARC is normally the
        most abundant non-collagenous glycoprotein [ 3 ] . The
        second phenotype thus far uncovered is in the lens where
        SPARC is normally produced by lens epithelial cells [ 20 21
        ] and is a component of the lens capsule [ 20 22 ] .
        SPARC-null mice show progressive cataract formation
        beginning approximately 1.5 months after birth [ 14 21 ] .
        Electron microscopy of the SPARC-null lens revealed
        abnormality at the lens cell-ECM (capsule) interface with
        an intrusion of cellular processes into the basement
        membrane of the lens capsule, whereas wild-type lens
        exhibited a precise border at the cell-matrix interface [
        23 ] . In the present study, we show for the first time
        that SPARC plays a role in wound repair in vivo and in
        vitro. Wound healing in SPARC-null mice is retarded due to
        delayed granulation tissue formation. Repair of a wound in
        vitro by dermal fibroblasts is impaired due to defect in
        cell migration.
      
      
        Results
        
          Delayed wound healing in SPARC-deficient
          mice
          Two independent experiments with 25 mm oblong
          full-thickness excision wounds (6 mice of each type per
          experiment), including the striated muscle layer
          (panniculus carnosus), on the dorsal skin of wild-type
          and SPARC-null mice indicated that the absence of SPARC
          impeded healing of skin wounds. One day after surgery a
          clear thin film of dried exudate covered the wounds in
          the wild-type and SPARC-null mice. Build-up of dehydrated
          wound crusts or scabs began at day 3 and became
          subsequently more extensive. In the SPARC-null mice scabs
          were thicker and extravasation of blood, visible in the
          gaps within the scabs, was more frequent and extensive
          than that in the control mice. In control wild-type mice,
          loss of wound scabs began at day 17 and was complete in
          all mice by day 24 (Fig. 1A, lower panel) with wounds
          well-healed and epithelial covering restored (Fig. 1A,
          upper panel). In contrast, the scabs in SPARC-null mice
          started to come off partially around day 14, resulting in
          a scab with a gaping red wound field, which was evident
          even at 22 days (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Healing of
          SPARC-null wounds remained incomplete on day 24, and
          complete healing in all mice was observed between 25 and
          31 days (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Similar results were seen
          with 30-mm circular excision wounds (not shown).
          Although the larger 25 mm oblong, full thickness
          excisions allowed us to observe visible differences in
          wound healing progression, the wound sites were too
          fragile to be isolated for histological examination. We
          therefore made 6 mm full thickness circular lesions and
          examined the gross and microscopic appearance of skin
          wounds at various time points, with four wild-type and
          four SPARC-null mice at each time point. Examination of
          the gross appearance of wounds showed no apparent
          difference in healing progression between wild-type and
          SPARC-null mice, with build up of scab at day 1 and loss
          of scab by day 10. However, we detected histological
          differences between wild-type and SPARC-null mice.
          Histology of 6 mm wound tissues showed that at day 2
          after wounding the epidermis at wound edges had grown
          thicker in both wild-type and SPARC-null mice, indicating
          that proliferation of keratinocytes had began. However,
          no granulation tissue formation was visible at this stage
          of healing in either wild-type or SPARC-null mice
          (results not shown). At day 4 reepithelialization and
          granulation tissue growth had begun as shown in the 6 mm
          biopsies in figure 1B. The epidermis had begun to migrate
          centrally to cover the wound edge and reepithelialization
          at this early stage of wound healing in a small biopsy
          appeared to be as efficient in SPARC-null mice as in the
          wild-type mice except for the more extensive granulation
          tissue formation in the wild-type than in the SPARC-null
          mice. In wild-type mice, the granulation tissue had
          formed at the edge and base of the wound. In SPARC-null
          mice, the granulation tissue covered the edge of the
          wound but did not extend to the base of the wound (Fig.
          1B). At day 6, reepithelialization and granulation tissue
          formation appeared as elaborate in SPARC-null mice as in
          wild-type mice with the neoepidermis and granulation
          tissue filling two third of the wound beds (not shown).
          By day 10, the wound areas in both control and mutant
          mice were smaller, reflecting some degree of wound
          contraction, and in addition, the wounds were now closed,
          being completely covered by epidermal cells and
          underlying granulation tissue (results not shown).
          Northern analysis of 6 mm circular wound tissues
          isolated during a 6 day healing period showed similar
          patterns of cytokeratin 14 expression in SPARC-null mice
          and wild-type mice (Fig. 2). Cytokeratin 14 expression is
          associated with proliferative epidermal keratinocytes at
          wound sites [ 24 ] . Such expression in control unwounded
          skin (0 day) is, as expected, very low but increased
          appreciably by day 2 after wounding with peak expression
          at day 4. Interestingly, expression of cytokeratin 14 was
          up-regulated in the normal epidermis and neoepidermis of
          SPARC-null mice relative to those of wild-type mice (Fig.
          2), although histologically no differences in
          reepithelialization between the SPARC-null and wild-type
          wounds were apparent (Fig. 1B). Analysis of Î±1(I)
          collagen and fibronectin transcripts, which are
          synthesized by fibroblasts of dermal granulation tissue [
          25 26 27 ] , revealed that expression of both transcripts
          was delayed in the wounds of SPARC-null mice relative to
          those of wild-type mice (Fig. 2). In wild-type mice, both
          transcripts were expressed in the unwounded skin (0 day)
          used as controls. At day 2, the levels of the two
          transcripts decreased appreciably below the levels of the
          control skin followed by an increase in expression
          between day 2 and day 4. In the case of SPARC-null mice,
          expression of the two transcripts remained below the
          control unwounded skin at day 2 and day 4 and did not
          begin to increase until between day 4 and day 6 (Fig. 2).
          Thus, we conclude that SPARC deficiency compromises
          granulation tissue formation that involves fibroblast
          ingrowth and ECM protein deposition.
        
        
          Impaired wound repair by cultured SPARC-null
          fibroblasts
          Granulation tissue formation after cutaneous wounding
          involves both cell proliferation and migration [ 1 ] .
          However, these two processes are difficult to analyze in
          vivo. To investigate these two processes, a small scrape
          wound was made across a confluent monolayer of primary
          dermal fibroblasts and the process of wound closure was
          monitored (Fig. 3A). In wild-type cells, at 11 hours
          after wounding, repair of the wound was essentially
          complete with the denuded area covered with fibroblasts
          (Fig. 3A, upper panel). In comparison, repair of the
          wounded SPARC-null fibroblast monolayer was retarded
          (Fig. 3A, lower panel). The denuded area remained
          unpopulated through 11 to 15 hours, even though cells at
          the edge of the wound showed forward movement. The first
          evidence of cell ingrowth did not appear until around 24
          hours and wound repair was not complete until some time
          between 31 and 48 hours after wounding. Since the
          doubling time for these dermal fibroblasts was about 20
          hours (our unpublished observation), the healing in
          wild-type cells at 11 hours implied that wild-type
          fibroblasts had extensively migrated from the edge of the
          wound into the wound site prior to the onset of cell
          proliferation. However SPARC-null cells did not show any
          migration prior to the onset of cell proliferation and
          ingrowth was retarded even after the onset of cell
          proliferation. This defect in cell motility was rescued
          to the level of wild-type cells by the addition of
          purified SPARC (Fig. 3B). The denuded area was
          repopulated by the SPARC-null cells by 11 hours in the
          presence of added SPARC (Fig. 3B, lower panel) as
          compared to 48 hours in its absence (Fig. 3A, lower
          panel). The repair of wild-type fibroblasts was not
          affected by the addition of SPARC and was complete by 11
          hours in the presence of exogenous SPARC (Fig. 3B, upper
          panel) or in its absence (Fig. 3A, upper panel). The
          results indicate that SPARC regulates wound healing
          directly through cell migration. Although the long period
          of impeded ingrowth of SPARC-null cells after wounding
          already suggested defect in cell migration rather than
          cell proliferation, we determined cell migration in the
          absence of cell proliferation. Mitomycin C blocks mitosis
          and thus allows analysis of cell migration in the absence
          of cell proliferation. Treatment with mitomycin C did not
          affect the time course of wound closure of either the
          wild-type or SPARC-null cells (Fig. 4). The wound in a
          monolayer of wild-type fibroblasts cultured in the
          absence or presence of mitomycin C healed by 15 hours
          after wounding (Fig. 4A). The wound in a monolayer of
          SPARC-null fibroblasts, whether cultured in the presence
          of mitomycin C or in its absence, remained unrepaired at
          15 hours, began to show slight closure at 24 hours and
          healed by 48 hours (Fig. 4B). These results confirm that
          cell migration is a key step affecting the rate of wound
          healing and that this process is impaired in SPARC-null
          cells. To further test our conclusion, we investigated
          whether cell proliferation was affected by the lack of
          SPARC. We found that SPARC-null fibroblasts incorporated
          3H-thymidine as efficiently as control wild-type
          fibroblasts over the 25 hour period studied (Fig. 5).
          These results together show that indeed cell motility,
          rather than cell proliferation, is the major factor in
          the retarded wound repair process in SPARC-null
          cells.
        
        
          Collagen-gel contraction by SPARC-null fibroblasts
          is not compromised
          An important event during wound healing is the
          contraction of newly formed granulation tissue by
          fibroblasts to bring together the edges of the wound [ 1
          ] . It has been reported [ 28 ] that fibroblasts
          incorporated in a collagen gel induce progressive
          contraction of the gel, resulting in the formation of a
          dense collagen disc of greatly reduced diameter. This
          phenomenon has been considered as an in vitro equivalent
          of the connective-tissue contraction that occurs during
          wound healing. We used this procedure to examine the
          contractile ability of SPARC-null fibroblasts. Gel
          diameter was measured at various time points following
          incorporation of fibroblasts in the collagen gel, and the
          area calculated and expressed as a percentage of the
          initial area. Primary dermal fibroblasts from SPARC-null
          mice contracted type I collagen gels as efficiently as
          primary dermal fibroblasts from wild-type mice,
          contracting to 30% of the initial area at 20 hours and to
          15% by 40 hours after incubation of the fibroblasts in
          collagen gels (Fig. 6).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study, we have shown for the first time that
        repair of excision wounds in SPARC-null mice is impaired.
        Histological examination and study of the expression
        patterns of ECM components, fibronectin and type I
        collagen, at the wound site suggested that retarded
        granulation tissue formation caused impaired wound repair.
        In vitro studies with dermal fibroblasts isolated from
        SPARC-null mice further showed that the ability of the
        cells to restore wounded areas was hindered and that a
        defect in cell migration, rather than cell proliferation,
        was the major cause of the delay in repopulating the
        denuded area. The delayed cell migration and restoration of
        the wound site were growth factor independent as these
        defects occurred in the presence of FBS. Furthermore these
        defects were reversed by the addition of purified SPARC,
        showing that the defect in cell migration and wound healing
        was attributable to the absence of SPARC. The mechanism by
        which SPARC influences cell migration is not known. One
        possibility is that the lack of SPARC causes alteration in
        ECM with respect to structure and/or function and thus
        contributes to a decrease in cell migration. Although SPARC
        has been postulated to be involved in wound healing due to
        its elevated expression in fibroblasts and macrophages at
        wound sites [ 18 ] , our results are the first to
        demonstrate that SPARC indeed plays a role in wound repair
        and that it does so by promoting granulation tissue
        formation through modulation of fibroblast migration.
        In large wounds (25 mm), visual examination of wounds
        showed that loss of wound scabs and restoration of
        epidermal covering were delayed in SPARC-null mice due to
        premature, partial loss of scabs and neoepidermis,
        resulting in repeated setbacks in the reepithelialization
        process. However, similar setbacks in reepitheliallization
        were not observed in small wounds (6 mm). Furthermore,
        histological examination of new epidermal cells in the
        wound bed and Northern analysis of expression of a wound
        keratinocyte marker, cytokeratin 14, in the biopsied
        tissues revealed that reepithelialization in SPARC-null
        mice was probably not compromised. It seems possible that
        reepithelialization occurs normally in SPARC-null mice.
        However, since SPARC is a matricellular protein involved in
        cell-matrix interaction [ 3 4 23 ] , cell-matrix
        interaction-related defects may exert a significant
        influence in large wounds of SPARC-null mice causing
        premature loss of a part of the scabs and of the
        neoepidermis, a pathophysiological process requiring
        repeated healing. In small wounds, the pathophysiological
        process caused by the cell-matrix interaction-related
        defects may be too small to affect reepithelialization
        significantly with the result that restoration of epidermal
        covering progresses as normally as in the wild-type mice.
        Perhaps this size-dependent wound closure may have
        contributed to the enhanced wound healing in SPARC-null
        mice cited recently as an unpublished result [ 29 ] .
        Although SPARC is required for migration of dermal
        fibroblasts into the wound site, it is apparently not
        essential to the motility of keratinocytes since
        reepithelialization appears normal in SPARC-null mice.
        Thus, the role of SPARC in cell migration may be cell
        type-specific, which has been shown to be the case with in
        vitro studies [ 7 9 10 ] . Cell motility is controlled by a
        cycle of cell attachment and detachment. It is generally
        accepted that the driving force for cell movement is
        provided by the dynamic reorganization of the actin
        cytoskeleton, directing protrusion (lamellipodia and
        filopodia) at the front of the cell and retraction at the
        rear [ 30 31 ] . Although we have not examined the
        ultrastructure of the dermal fibroblasts at the edge of
        wound sites, we showed previously by electron microscopy
        that in the lens of SPARC-null mice numerous cellular
        processes extended into the ECM of the lens capsule [ 23 ]
        . We further showed that, in contrast to the abnormal
        filopodial projections at the lens cell-ECM interface,
        cell-cell contacts between the neighboring lens epithelial
        cells and between the lens epithelial and fiber cells were
        normal [ 23 ] . The results indicate that disassembly of
        cell-cell contacts between lens cells is not taking place,
        despite the forward movement of the lens cells into the ECM
        of the capsule. In this study, the lack of ingrowth despite
        the forward movement of cells at the edge of wounded
        monolayers suggests that a similar failure of SPARC-null
        dermal fibroblasts to break away from its neighboring cells
        may account for the impaired cell motility observed during
        wound healing in vitro. Previously, SPARC has been shown to
        regulate cell-cell contact through tyrosine phosphorylation
        of adherens junction proteins [ 32 ] . Electron microscopy
        of the SPARC-null dermal fibroblasts at wound sites should
        not only confirm the role of SPARC in cell motility but
        also reveal how SPARC mediates cell-ECM and cell-cell
        interactions to promote cell motility.
        We showed in the present study that there are no overt
        differences in cell proliferation and type I collagen gel
        contraction between control and SPARC-null dermal
        fibroblasts. Wound contraction depends on migration of
        fibroblasts into the wound site where they lay down their
        own collagen-rich matrix [ 2 ] . Northern analysis of wound
        biopsies showed that production of type I collagen and
        fibronectin by the null mice, at the beginning of wound
        healing, was lower than that by the wild-type mice.
        Subsequently, the wound in the null mice was fully invaded
        by fibroblasts and expression of type I collagen and
        fibronectin by the SPARC-null mice was as abundant as that
        by the wild-type mice. Wound contraction takes place when a
        wound site is filled with fibroblasts and ECM [ 2 ] . Thus,
        it is likely that consistent with the in vitro study wound
        contraction in the SPARC-null mice is not compromised.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The delay in granulation tissue formation and healing of
        excision wounds in SPARC-null mice, and the defect in wound
        closure in in vitro assays indicate that SPARC plays a role
        in wound healing through its effect on cell migration. Cell
        migration is crucial not only to wound healing but also to
        a wide variety of normal or abnormal biological phenomena
        such as embryogenesis, leukocyte immigration into areas of
        insult, and tumor cell invasion. SPARC-null mice and their
        cells should provide a useful system to investigate how a
        matricellular protein regulates pleiotropic functions
        through cell migration and how its absence alters
        biological processes.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Animals
          SPARC-null mice and control wild-type mice used in
          this study were generated and maintained on a mixed
          genetic background (F2) of 129SvEv Ã C57BL/6j as
          described previously [ 14 ] .
        
        
          Wound healing assays
          Two- to 3-month-old male mice were anesthetized
          intraperitoneally with avertin (0.5 g/kg body weight).
          The hair on the back was cut and full-thickness 25 mm
          oblong or 30 mm circular wounds, including panniculus
          carnosus, were made. Wounds were neither dressed nor
          sutured. Mice were caged individually and progression of
          wound repair was monitored daily.
        
        
          Histology
          Five full-thickness 6 mm circular wounds were made on
          the back of an anesthetized mouse by a procedure similar
          to that described above. The 6 mm diameter wounds
          provided stable wound beds appropriate for collection of
          wound tissues for histological analysis. Mice were
          sacrificed by CO2 asphyxia 2, 4, 6, and 10 days after
          wounding. An area 7 to 8 mm in diameter, which included
          the uninjured epithelial margins, was removed, bisected
          in the midtransversal plane, fixed in 10% formalin
          (Buffered Formalde-Fresh, Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn,
          NJ) and embedded in paraffin. Sections (6 Î¼m) were cut
          from both faces of bisected tissues and stained with
          hematoxylin and eosin.
        
        
          RNA analysis
          Circular, full-thickness dorsal cutaneous biopsies of
          6 mm diameter were made on the backs of anesthetized mice
          and wound sites, including the uninjured epithelial
          margins, were excised 2, 4, and 6 days post wounding as
          described above. Control, unwounded dorsal skin (0 day)
          was also isolated. The harvested tissues were frozen
          immediately in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated
          using guanidine thiocyanate extraction and 15 Î¼g of the
          total RNA was analyzed by Northern hybridization as
          described previously [ 16 ] . cDNA probes used in
          hybridization were human fibronectin [ 33 ] , Î±1(I)
          collagen [ 34 ] , or cytokeratin 14 cDNA (Hung Tseng,
          unpublished results). The same Northern hybridization
          filters were reprobed with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
          dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA. The amounts of transcripts
          were quantified by PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics) and
          normalized to GAPDH transcript. Two independent
          experiments gave similar hybridization patterns.
        
        
          Isolation of primary dermal fibroblasts
          Primary dermal fibroblasts were prepared from 3 day
          old newborn mice. Mice were euthanized by cervical
          dislocation and sterilized with 70% ethanol. Skin was
          removed, washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and
          incubated overnight in 0.25% trypsin in PBS at 4Â°C. The
          dermis was separated from the epidermis and subjected to
          further incubation overnight in 200 U/ml of crude
          collagenase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in Dulbecco's modified
          Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies Inc.,
          Gaithersburg, MD) at 37Â°C. Small cell aggregates were
          separated from large tissue fragments by gravitation
          sedimentation for 10 minutes at room temperature. The
          supernatant was carefully removed, and cells were
          collected by centrifugation and plated in DMEM containing
          10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT) for 48 hours. The cells were
          then re-plated twice to deplete from the culture the
          residual keratinocytes that do not survive re-plating in
          10% FBS-DMEM. The fibroblasts were checked for their
          spindle shaped morphology (passage one) and used for
          future experiments. Twenty fibroblast preparations were
          made from 10 wild-type or SPARC-null mice. In all
          experiments, wild-type and SPARC-null cells at identical
          passage numbers (<5) were used.
        
        
          In vitro wound-healing and cell migration
          assays
          Both wild-type and SPARC-null primary dermal
          fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates (5 Ã 10
          5cells/well), and grown to confluence overnight in DMEM
          containing 10% FBS. Monolayers were wounded using a 1 ml
          plastic micropipette tip and incubated at 37Â°C in DMEM
          containing 10% FBS or in DMEM containing 10% FBS and
          SPARC protein purified from human platelets (48 Î¼g/ml;
          Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). At various time points, cells
          were rinsed with PBS and visualized for migration of
          cells into denuded space by a phase-contrast microscope.
          The assays were performed in triplicate in two separate
          experiments. To investigate cell motility, monolayers of
          dermal fibroblasts were prepared and wounded as described
          above. The wounded monolayers were incubated at 37Â°C in
          DMEM containing 10% FBS with or without mitomycin C (10
          Î¼g/ml, Sigma, St Louis, MO) to block mitosis. Migration
          of cells into denuded areas was monitored for up to 48
          hours.
        
        
          Incorporation of 3H-thymidine
          Wild-type and SPARC-null dermal fibroblasts were
          plated in 96-well plates (1 Ã 10 4cells/well) and
          cultured overnight in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cells
          were then washed three times with DMEM without FBS and
          incubated with 3H-thymidine (1 Î¼Ci/ml; NEN, Boston, MA)
          in DMEM containing 10% FBS for time periods varying
          between 0 and 30 hours. Due to the problem of cell death
          (>80%) in serum-free medium, cell cycle
          synchronization of the dermal fibroblasts in serum-free
          medium was not performed prior to 3H-thymidine assays.
          DNA-bound 3H-thymidine was immobilized on glass fiber
          filter paper (Packard, Meriden, CT) with the aid of an
          automated cell harvester (Tomtec, Orange, CT) and the
          tritium incorporation was determined by scintillation
          counting. Experiments were performed in triplicate with
          cells derived from two different dermal fibroblast
          preparations.
        
        
          Collagen gel contraction assay
          A standard procedure [ 11 ] for collagen disc
          contraction was followed with minor modifications.
          Briefly, 6-well tissue culture plates were made
          non-adhesive with a coating of 1% agarose (Sea-Kem LE,
          FMC BioProducts, Rockland, MD). One volume of a solution
          of 3 mg/ml bovine type I collagen (Vitrogenâ¢, Celtrix
          Corp., Palo Alto, CA) was combined with 1/6 volume of 7X
          DMEM and sufficient 1X DMEM added to yield a final
          collagen concentration of 0.75 mg/ml. A suspension of
          mouse dermal fibroblasts at 2 Ã 10 6cell/ml in DMEM was
          added to 9 volumes of the type 1 collagen solution, and
          FBS added to provide a concentration of 2% FBS in the
          final solution. The resulting cell suspension was
          dispensed into agarose-coated wells (2 ml/well) and
          gelled for 2 hours at 37Â°C. DMEM (2 ml) with 2% FBS was
          subsequently added to the wells and the gels were gently
          detached from the walls to float the collagen disks. The
          collagen/cell mixtures were incubated in humidified air
          at 37Â°C and contraction was monitored for 72 hours. The
          assay was performed three times, each in triplicate. The
          area of gels was calculated from the average diameter of
          the experiments and expressed as a percentage of the
          initial area.
