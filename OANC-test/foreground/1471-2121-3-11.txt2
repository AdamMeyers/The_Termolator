        Plasma membrane microparticles (MP) of endothelial
        origin have been identified in normal human blood [ 1 2 3 ]
        and increased counts of MP carrying endothelial antigens
        were documented in the blood of patients with lupus
        anticoagulant [ 1 ] , acute coronary syndrome [ 4 ] ,
        thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [ 5 ] or in patients
        with exacerbated multiple sclerosis [ 6 ] . Similarly to
        blood platelets, endothelial cells release MP which express
        phosphatidylserine (PS) on their surface. PS-exposing MP in
        blood appear to act as the catalytic surface for assembly
        of the prothrombinase complex [ 7 ] . Although circulating
        MP of various cellular origin in patient with sepsis were
        reported to be procoagulant through multiple mechanisms [ 8
        9 ] , in healthy individuals they may have an anticoagulant
        function by promoting the generation of low amounts of
        thrombin that activate protein C [ 2 ] .
        The process of membrane vesiculation and MP-release in
        platelets has been shown to require a calpain-dependent
        dissociation of membrane proteins from the submembrane
        cytoskeleton and most likely involves intracellular
        signaling by platelet protein kinases [ 10 ] . Besides
        platelets stimulated by various agonists such as thrombin
        with collagen or the complement complex C5b-9 [ 7 11 ] , a
        release of PS-containing membrane MP was demonstrated in
        other cell types such as endotoxin-stimulated monocytes [
        12 ] , polymorphonuclear leucocytes stimulated with the
        chemotactic peptide FMLP [ 13 ] or apoptotic T-lymphocytes
        [ 14 ] . The normal restriction of PS to the inner surface
        of the plasma membrane becomes perturbed in apoptotic cells
        [ 15 16 ] . When exposed, PS is a determinant for phagocyte
        recognition of cells to be cleared. Plasma membrane
        blebbing and MP-release are generally accepted as typical
        signs of cell apoptosis [ 17 ] .
        In addition to a possible pathophysiological role of
        circulating MP, analysis of MP derived from endothelial
        cells may be a valuable diagnostic marker of vessel wall
        injury. The phospholipid-binding protein annexin V has a
        high affinity for PS [ 18 ] and is utilized in MP detection
        in blood and in cell supernatants [ 1 ] . Since very little
        is known about the mechanism of MP-release from endothelial
        cell, it is difficult to judge the type and extent of
        endothelial injury represented by increased plasma counts
        of endothelial MP. We used flow cytometry to study the
        release of annexin V-binding membrane microparticles from
        cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC)
        stimulated by various agonists. We further focused our
        study on MP-release from HUVEC after proapoptotic
        stimulation with the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin
        (CPT). Since CPT analogues become one of the most promising
        new classes of antineoplastic agents introduced into the
        clinic in recent years [ 19 ] , activity of camptothecin on
        endothelial cells may be of great interest.
      
      
        Results
        
          With the exception of high concentration of
          ionophore A23187, rapid stimulation of HUVEC with various
          agonists did not result in a release of annexin V-binding
          microparticles
          Flow cytometry analysis of HUVEC culture supernatant
          demonstrated that a 30 min treatment with 10 μM ionophore
          A23187 caused the release of low counts of annexin
          V-binding MP (Fig. 1A). Similar short-time activation of
          HUVEC with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (1 μg/mL),
          human thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) 1-50
          μmol/L, human thrombin (THR) 0.1-10 NIH Unit/mL, human
          tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) 3.5 kU/mL or human
          angiotensin II (AGTII) 1 μmol/L did not cause any
          significant increase in MP-release (Fig. 1A). All of the
          agonists applied induced morphological changes in HUVEC
          seen by phase contrast light microscopy, which confirmed
          the cellular activation (not shown).
        
        
          Proapoptotic, but not proinflammatory, stimulation
          induced a release of annexin V-binding microparticles
          from HUVEC
          MP count increased overnight in the media of
          unstimulated cell culture, but this was not enhanced by
          TNFα (1000 U/ mL) or by LPS (10 μg/mL). However, when
          cells were activated with TNFα in the presence of
          cycloheximide (50 μg/mL) to promote apoptosis [ 20 ] , a
          dramatic increase in MP count was observed, as compared
          to TNFα or cycloheximide treatment alone (Fig. 1B).
          Similarly, induction of apoptosis with 5 μM CPT, a
          topoisomerase I inhibitor [ 19 ] , led to a release of
          annexin V-binding MP which was prevented by ZVAD. ZVAD
          also inhibited a release of MP from unstimulated cells,
          which probably represents spontaneous apoptosis of
          cultured HUVEC (Fig. 1B).
        
        
          MP-release did not correlate with the level of cell
          apoptosis in HUVEC stimulated with camptothecin
          Phase contrast microscopy showed that HUVEC culture
          treated for 24 hrs with 5 μM CPT (Fig. 2C) lost
          confluence with about 30-40% cells remaining adherent.
          The level of apoptosis of adherent cells was assessed by
          using TUNEL and annexin V-FITC/ propidium iodide assays
          (Fig 3). Approximately one third of the remaining
          adherent cells showed annexin V-binding (Fig. 3B) and
          DNA-fragmentation (TUNEL-positivity) (Fig. 3C).
          Interestingly, a ten times lower concentration of CPT
          (500 nM) also induced significant MP-release after only 4
          hrs of treatment (Fig. 3A) and after 24 hrs, 500 nM
          camptothecin induced MP-release comparable to 5 μM CPT
          treatment, but without any significant increase in
          annexin V-binding to the cells or DNA-fragmentation (Fig.
          3B,3C). The cell culture was still confluent (Fig. 2B)
          with about 20-30% lower cell density as compared with
          0.5% DMSO treated HUVEC (Fig. 2A). This result indicates
          that MP-release is not related to cell desquamation. To
          investigate whether maturation of the cell culture
          influences the degree of MP-release from HUVEC in
          response to CPT, we compared MP-release from subconfluent
          HUVEC (50% of confluence) at 24 hrs in culture, HUVEC
          reaching confluence at 48 hrs in culture and overgrown
          HUVEC at 72 hrs in culture. Our results showed that
          MP-release in response to CPT declined with culture
          maturation. There was also a change of the sensitivity of
          overgrown HUVEC to CPT treatment in confluent 72 hrs old
          culture resulting in the higher concentration of CPT (5
          μM) releasing higher levels of MP (Fig. 4). In growing
          culture at 24 hrs, 500 nM CPT caused even higher
          MP-release than 5 μM CPT. In confluent HUVEC 48 hrs old,
          the MP-release induced by 500 nM and 5 μM CPT was not
          significantly different (Fig. 4).
        
        
          Endothelial antigens CD 105 and CD 59 were both
          expressed on living cells, apoptotic bodies and other
          cell fragments in CPT treated HUVEC culture but CD 105
          was absent on 50% of annexin V-binding membrane
          microparticles
          Using flow cytometry, in SSC vs. FSC plot we gated
          homogeneous population of single living cells (G1 on Fig.
          5A), which appeared negative in propidium iodide staining
          (Fig. 5B). Living cells from control cultures as well as
          from cultures treated with CPT were strongly positive for
          both antigens CD 105 and CD 59 (Fig. 5C). Expression of
          CD59 on endothelial cells was not influenced by 24 hrs
          incubation with 500nM or 5μM CPT as compared with control
          cells incubated with 0.5% DMSO. Expression of CD105 was
          only slightly decreased on CPT treated cells. Cell
          fragments > 4 μm in size as compared with standard
          beads were gated separately (G2 on Fig. 5A). Larger cell
          fragments appeared positive in propidium iodide staining
          (Fig. 5B). All analyzed cell fragments were positive for
          CD59 and also expressed CD 105 (Fig. 5D). Comparison of
          areas under the different peaks on the histogram (Fig.
          5C,5D) indicates that the portion of cell fragments
          corresponding to apoptotic bodies and necrotic cells was
          significantly higher in culture treated with 5 μM CPT as
          compared to culture treated with 500 nM CPT or with 0.5%
          DMSO alone. In a separate protocol we analyzed the
          expression of CD 59 and CD 105 on membrane MP. Comparison
          of FSC values of standard beads and analyzed MP showed
          that 95% of annexin V-binding MP released from HUVEC were
