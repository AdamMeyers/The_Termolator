        Although the role of the osteoclast in bone resorption
        is becoming better understood [ 1], much remains to be
        learned about osteoclastogenesis and the exact mechanism of
        action of anti-resorbing agents on the functional
        osteoclast. The anti-resorbing agent 17β-estradiol is
        especially noteworthy because of the association of its
        decline at menopause with the development of postmenopausal
        osteoporosis. As previously noted by Liu and Howard, the
        underlying cellular changes responsible the increased bone
        formation which follows estrogen administration are still
        not well characterized [ 2].
        In the present report we report findings on alterations
        in osteoclast morphology following long term administration
        of high doses of 17β-estradiol to B6D2F1 mice. Development
        of osteosclerosis and the disappearance of the marrow space
        in these estrogen-treated mice is an interesting and useful
        model since marrow stromal cells not only contain the
        precursors for osteogenic cell lineages, but they also
        exert important effects on osteoclastogenesis and
        lymphopoiesis, and modulate the effects of some systemic
        factors of bone turnover. Osteoclasts, as well as
        osteoblasts, possess estrogen receptors [ 3, 4, 5, 6].
        Hematopoietic cells also influence osteogenic cell
        differentiation, and some evidence suggests that mature
        lymphocytes influence osteoclast and osteoblast function.
        In the estrogen-treated mouse model used in the studies
        reported here, natural killer (NK) cells, which rely upon
        an intact bone marrow for full marrow maturation, are
        arrested in a nonlytic state [ 7]; since marrow space is
        lessened due to the osteosclerosis, the spleen provides the
        source for T and B cells and macrophages.
        The objective of the present study was to assess the
        functional state of osteoclasts in estrogen-treated mice by
        determining if osteoclasts retained tartrate-resistant acid
        phosphatase activity (TRAP) and normal ultrastructural
        features.
      
      
        Results
        Radiographic examination of excised specimens from
        control and estradiol-treated mice confirmed the presence
        of osteosclerosis in the femurs of estradiol-treated mice.
        Diaphyseal cortices were prominent in the midshaft of
        control specimens (Figure 1Aand 1C), but could not be
        identified in specimens from estradiol-treated animals
        (Figure 1B, 1Dand 1E). These changes were not due to
        differences in radiographic technique since control and
        estradiol-treated femurs shown in Figure 1were exposed
        side-by-side on the same film.
        Histologic examination also confirmed osteosclerotic
        features in femurs from estradiol-treated mice. Specimens
        from estradiol-treated mice contained only small regions of
        bone marrow (Fig. 2B) in contrast to control bones (Figure
        2A). Since the normal, pre-estradiol treatment endosteal
        margin could still be histologically identified on these
        specimens, specimens were evaluated with quantitative
        histomorphometry by first measuring the old, normal marrow
        area and then measuring the small marrow cavity areas
        present at time of harvest. On average 86% of mid-shaft
        marrow space was replaced by bone in estradiol-treated mice
        at 8 weeks (p < 0.0001 control vs
        estradiol-treated).
        Osteoclasts (Ocl) present in both control and
        estradiol-treated mice showed positive localization of TRAP
        (Figure 2C). In contrast to the close apposition of Ocl to
        the bone surface seen in control specimens, in
        estradiol-treated animals Ocl extended away from the bone
        surface with little bone contact (Figure 2D). In order to
        further investigate this observation, transmission electron
        microscopy was performed to examine the fine structure of
        the Ocl in estradiol-treated and control specimens.
        Figure 3Aillustrates the normal ultrastructural
        appearance of an Ocl from a control femur; note the normal
        ruffled border and snug apposition of the Ocl to the bone
        surface. Ocl from estradiol-treated animals, however,
        frequently showed only one margin of the cell perimeter
        involved with small areas of ruffed border formation, with
        the remainder of the cell surface displaying a smooth
        profile (Fig. 3B). Some Ocl from estradiol-treated animals
        had no ruffled borders in spite of the appearance of some
        attempt to form sealing podosome regions (Fig. 3C).
      
      
        Discussion
        The present study indicated that severe changes in Ocl
        morphology are associated with the cells' inability to
        carry out resorption in the osteosclerotic
        estradiol-treated mouse. Although osteoclasts retained TRAP
        activity, ultrastructural alterations were identified in
        estradiol-treated animals in both the sealing patterns of
        osteoclasts against the bone surface and in altered brush
        border morphology. Proper sealing of the osteoclast against
        the bone surface and a functional brush border are two
        ultrastructural components believed to be of major
        importance in Ocl function. The ultrastructural alterations
        identified in estrogen-treated mice were very likely the
        cellular functional basis for the decreased resorption and
        development of osteosclerosis in estrogen-treated mice.
        Osteoclast function and ultrastructural morphology have
        been shown to be highly responsive to anti-resorbing agents
        such as ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate (EHDP) [ 8, 9],
        dichloromethylene diphosphanate (Cl 
        2 MDP) [ 10], calcitonin [ 11, 12, 13],
        other anti-resorptive agents, such as mithramycin [ 14],
        and to gallium nitrate [ 15].
        Although histochemical TRAP localization provides an
        accurate and sensitive histologic method for identification
        of Ocl, understanding osteoclastogenesis and Ocl function
        remain a challenging area of bone research. The current
        understanding of Ocl function is that the Ocl seals its
        perimeter along the bone surface by means of the podosome [
        16, 17, 18] . Within this sealed margin, projections from
        the cytoplasm form the ruffled border, a specialized
        Ocl-extracellular space in which bone resorption occurs. In
        the present study in the mouse, differentiation of
        osteoclast progenitors appears to be dependent on the
        direct interaction of bone marrow stromal cells with Ocl
        precursor cells [ 19, 20]. Recent data of Baylink [ 21] and
        Linkhart [ 22] provide evidence that two inbred strains of
        mice with different bone densities may have fundamental
        differences in bone resorption (not bone formation), and
        that genes affecting the bone marrow Ocl precursor
        population may contribute to relative differences in the
        C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ strains. In vivo and in vitro studies
        of avian osteoclasts led Pederson et al to suggest that
        modulation of the Ocl response to estrogen may be
        controlled by alterations in the Ocl estrogen receptor
        level [ 3].
        Maturation of osteoclasts from their macrophage
        precursors requires marrow stromal cells or their
        osteoblast progeny as shown by Udagawa et al [ 23]. These
        cells produce macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)
        and the receptor for activation of nuclear factor kappa b
        (NF- 
        k B) (RANK) ligand (RANKL). M-CSF is
        essential for macrophage maturation, but formation of
        osteoclasts also requires contact between osteoclast
        precursors and stromal cells or osteoblasts [ 23]. As
        described by Hofbauer et al [ 24], the quantity of bone
        resorbed depends on the balance between expression of RANKL
        and of its inhibitor, osteoprotegerin (OPG). Hofbauer et al
        suggest that the stimulation of the pool of M-CSF
        precursors to committed osteoclastogenesis by RANKL may be
        one of the central pathophysiologic pathways involved in
        increasing the number of osteoclasts in osteoporosis.
        Futures studies of the estrogen-treated mouse model are
        needed which are designed to address osteoclastogenesis and
        osteoprotegerin (OPG) secretion by osteoblasts. OPG is
        currently hypothesized to be an important paracrine
        mediator of the antiresorptive action of estrogen on bone
        cells [ 25]. In osteoblast cell lines exposed to estrogen,
        OPG mRNA and protein levels were increased compared to
        controls. Hofbauer et al have suggested that estrogen may
        exert its anti-resorptive effects by enhancement of OPG
        secretion by osteoblasts [ 11].
        Future studies should also assess the temporal
        development of functional changes in the osteoclast
        populations during estrogen treatment, and the patterns of
        osteoclast death with special attention to apoptosis.
        Estradiol has been shown to modulate IL-1 action on human
        osteoclasts in vitro; estrogen administration inhibited
        IL-1-mediated cytokine (IL-8) mRNA induction and caused
        increased Ocl apoptosis [ 26]. When avian Ocl were exposed
        to estradiol in vitro, the Ocl plasma membrane became
        depolarized and there was a marked decrease in potential,
        suggesting that estrogen may regulate osteoclasts through
        ion channel activities [ 27]. Estradiol has also been shown
        to inhibit acid production in avian Ocl [ 28]. The human
        pre-Ocl cell line FLG 29.1 has specific binding sites to
        17β-estradiol on the cell surface, and estradiol exposure
        increases the cellular pH, cAMP, cGMP and intracellular
        calcium [ 29].
        In vivo work by Jilka et al has shown that Il-6 can
        prevent the bone loss associated with ovariectomy in the
        mouse model [ 30]. Girasole et al have recently shown that
        production of IL-6 is inhibited in vitro by exposure of
        marrow cells to 17β-estradiol; cultures of mouse bone cells
        showed suppressed osteoclast development when exposed to
        either 17β-estradiol or a neutralizing antibody to Il-6 [
        31]. Future in vivo studies combining estradiol and
        selected interleukins may further elucidate how the network
        of signals from the marrow microenvironment influences both
        Ocl development and Ocl function.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Findings extend our understanding of osteoclast
        structure and function in the mouse exposed in vivo to high
        doses of estrogen. Ultrastructural examination showed that
        osteoclasts from estrogen-treated mice were unable to seal
        against the bone surface and were unable to form ruffled
        borders.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        B6D2F1 mice were selected for this study based upon the
        following criteria. The C57BL/6 mouse is positive for the
        NK 1.1 epitope but from previous unpublished data we found
        that the C57BL/6 responded poorly to estradiol. From
        previous hybrid resistance studies we had historical data
        that the B6D2F1 mouse would be positive for the NK 1.1
        epitope and respond well to the estradiol. B6D2F1 male mice
        aged 4-5 weeks were implanted for at least 12 weeks with
        silastic tubing filled with 15 mg 17β-estradiol [ 32, 33,
        34, 35]; age-matched controls received empty tubing. NK
        cytolytic functions disappeared in estradiol-treated mice
        by 8 weeks. Previous work with the model by Roubinian et al
        showed that administration of 5-6.5 mg estradiol by this
        method returned estrogen levels to normal in ovariectomized
        mice for more than 3 months [ 36]. Seaman et al has also
        reported that administration 15 mg estradiol in this model
        was capable of raising estradiol to 9 times the normal
        level [ 37, 38].
        At 8-18 weeks post-implantation, euthanasia was
        performed (CO 
        2 inhalation) and femurs were harvested
        from 13 control and 33 estradiol-treated mice.
        Cross-sections of the femur and sections of femoral
        metaphyses and epiphyses were studied. For light
        microscopy, specimens were either fixed in 10% neutral
        buffered formalin, decalcified and embedded in paraffin or
        processed non-decalcified and embedded in methyl
        methacrylate. For ultrastructural studies, specimens were
        fixed in Karnovsky's fixative, post-fixed in osmium
        tetroxide, decalcified, and embedded in Spurr resin. Thin
        sections were prepared and grids were stained with uranyl
        acetate and lead citrate. Sections were viewed on a
        Phillips CM10 transmission electron microscope. Light
        microscopic sections were evaluated with quantitative
        histomorphometry using OsteoMeasure software (OsteoMetrics,
        Inc., Decatur, GA). Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase
        (TRAP) localization was performed to identify osteoclasts
        with light microscopy. Protocols were approved by the
        appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use
        Committee.
        Statistical analysis of quantitative histomorphometric
        data used standard statistical methods; means and standard
        deviations were calculated. Unpaired t-tests were used to
        test for differences between means; a p-value of <0.05
        was considered statistically significant.
