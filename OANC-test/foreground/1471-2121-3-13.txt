        Chemokines are small, positively charged, secreted
        proteins that consist of an N-terminal region of variable
        conformation, three antiparallel beta-pleated sheets
        connected by loops, and a C-terminal alpha helix [ 1 ] .
        These proteins are multifunctional, with different regions
        of the molecules, in particular the N- and C-termini,
        performing specific functions [e.g. [ 1 2 3 4 ] ].
        Chemokines are best known for their functions in
        attracting and activating leukocytes. Shortly after injury,
        these small cytokines are primarily produced by
        fibroblasts, chemoattract leukocytes and activate their
        integrins causing them to adhere strongly to the
        endothelial cells as a prelude to their migration through
        the blood vessel wall to the underlying tissue and towards
        the source of the chemokine [ 5 ] . In addition to these
        functions during the early stages of wound healing, these
        small cytokines are also known to be involved in
        re-epithelialization, angiogenesis and granulation tissue
        development [ 3 6 7 8 ] , processes that are critical for
        proper healing.
        The first evidence that chemokines are associated with
        wound healing 
        in vivo was reported in 1990 using
        the chemokine cCAF (chicken Chemotactic and Angiogenic
        Factor; the product of the 9E3 gene), a CXC chemokine that
        is now known to be the ortologue for human IL-8 [ 9 ] .
        cCAF is expressed to high levels very shortly after
        wounding and during the first 24-48 hours after injury, and
        remains elevated for at least 16 days after wounding [ 6 10
        ] . It is primarily expressed by the fibroblasts of the
        granulation tissue, especially where interstitial collagen
        (Coll) is abundant, but the levels are also high in the
        endothelial cells of the microvessels, in the healing
        epidermis and in the connective tissue beneath the skin [ 6
        11 ] . In the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay,
        low concentration of cCAF results in chemotaxis of
        monocyte/macrophages and lymphocytes and the formation of a
        granulation-like tissue beneath the chemokine-containing
        pellet [ 3 ] . After four days of exposure to this
        chemokine, the ectoderm of the CAMs becomes thickened and
        the amount of fibrillar collagen in the tissue is markedly
        increased, strongly suggesting that cCAF is able to
        initiate some of the primary events that lead to
        granulation tissue formation [ 3 ] .
        Fibroblasts are important cells in the healing process.
        Upon injury, they are activated by the cytokines and growth
        factors released during the coagulation process to produce
        chemokines and additional cytokines and growth factors that
        are important in setting up the cascade of events that lead
        to granulation tissue formation. Activated fibroblasts
        proliferate and migrate across the provisional matrix
        formed by the fibrin-plasma fibronectin (FN) clot. As the
        clot is digested by plasmin, fibroblasts replace it with
        cellular FN, tenascin (TN) and Coll III [ 12 13 ] . These
        extracellular matrix proteins are critical for migration of
        endothelial cells, keratinocytes and additional fibroblasts
        into the wound and are important for proper generation of
        healthy healing tissue. Some of the fibroblasts
        differentiate into myofibroblasts, which contract to close
        the wound [ 4 14 15 ] . Myofibroblasts are fibrogenic,
        showing elevated expression of interstitial collagens,
        laminin, FN and TN, and inhibitors of matrix
        metalloproteinases such as TIMP-1 [ 15 16 17 18 19 ] .
        Because cCAF is expressed highly in the granulation tissue
        of wounds in areas where ECM is abundant [ 3 6 11 ] , and
        it stimulates fibroblasts to differentiate into
        myofibroblasts [ 4 ] , we investigated whether this
        chemokine stimulates the production of the four major ECM
        molecules mentioned above, interstitial Colls I and III, TN
        and cellular FN. Here we show that cCAF stimulates cultures
        of fibroblasts to produce TN, FN, and Coll I, albeit with
        different dynamics and that these ECM molecules are also
        increased in wounded tissues treated with cCAF.
      
      
        Results
        
          Effects of cCAF and its peptides on the production
          of TN
          In adults, TN, specifically TN C, is present almost
          exclusively in the granulation tissue of healing wounds [
          12 24 ] . In addition to providing a matrix for rapid
          migration of cells during wound repair, TN supports
          differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts [ 25 ]
          , which then produce more TN than do normal fibroblasts [
          15 18 ] . Because cCAF stimulates fibroblasts to
          differentiate into myofibroblasts, we tested the
          possibility that this chemokine also affects TN
          production. Immunolabeling of cells treated daily for
          four days with 750 ng/ml of the chemokine showed that
          cCAF stimulates the cells to produce more TN than the
          control cells (Fig. 1A& 1B). We have previously
          determined, using dose-dependent studies, that this
          concentration is optimal for functions of this chemokine
          on these embryonic fibroblasts and in processes of
          granulation tissue formation [ 3 4 ] ). Although
          chemokine concentrations of 10 -2-10 ng/ml can
          chemoattract and activate leukocytes, chemokines acting
          on other cell types such as endothelial cells, smooth
          muscle cells and fibroblasts require concentrations in
          the range of 10 2ng/ml and higher [ 4 26 27 28 ] . This
          is within physiological range; for example wound fluid
          from burn patients contain MGSA (a chemokine that is
          highly homologous to cCAF) concentrations of 10 2-10
          3ng/ml [ 29 ] . Because both the N-terminal and
          C-terminal peptides of cCAF have been shown to be
          functional in culture and 
          in vivo (1-4, 30), we also tested
          these two peptides (Fig. 1). The N-terminal 15aa peptide
          produced an effect at least as strong as the whole
          molecule (Fig. 1C) whereas the effects of the C-terminal
          peptide (28aa) was closer to those of the control (Fig.
          1D). Western blot analysis of extracts from treated
          fibroblasts confirmed that cCAF increases production of
          TN in culture, that this effect also can be accomplished
          effectively by the N-peptide, but that the C-peptide
          produced an elevated, but substantially smaller, response
          than either the N-peptide or the whole cCAF molecule
          (Fig. 1E). To determine whether cCAF stimulates TN
          expression we examined the levels of mRNA for this ECM
          molecule. RT-PCR analysis showed significant increased
          levels of mRNA for TN after treatment with either cCAF or
          its N-peptide (Fig. 1F) but the increase stimulated by
          the C-terminus is much smaller correlating with the small
          increase in protein levels.
          To determine whether this effect is also observed 
          in vivo , excision wounds were made
          on the underside of wings of 2 week-old chicks. To avoid
          variations in genetic background, for each bird one wing
          was treated with vehicle and the other with cCAF, and
          treatments were applied every other day for 5 days. In
          normal wound healing, TN appeared at days 2-3 and
          disappeared during remodeling which begins around day 10
          after wounding. Therefore, tissues were collected at days
          3 and 7 after wounding and analyzed for TN by
          immunostaining and western blot analysis (Fig. 2A&
          2B). Immunoblot analysis of protein extracted from
          control wounds confirmed that TN deposition begun by 3
          days and that it increased dramatically by 7 days (Fig.
          2C, Control). In contrast, by 3 days, cCAF-treated wounds
          already contained as much TN as the control at 7 days and
          that by 7 days, the TN is dramatically reduced by the
          ongoing processes of repair (Fig 2C, cCAF). Thus, the
          addition of the chemokine to wounds shifts the peak of TN
          in the wound tissues to earlier stages of wound healing
          than in control wounds.
        
        
          Effects of cCAF and its peptides on the production
          of FN
          Cellular FN is abundantly present in granulation
          tissue, is produced primarily by the wound fibroblasts
          and myofibroblasts. Fibroblast cultures treated as for
          TN, produced much more FN, as shown by immunolabeling
          (Figs. 3A& 3B) and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3E).
          Unlike TN, this effect can only be accomplished by the
          whole cCAF molecule; immunolabeling and immunoblot
          analysis of cells treated with the N-peptide (Fig.
          3C& 3E) or C-peptide (Fig. 3D& 3E) revealed
          similar FN levels to control. Unlike TN, cCAF did not
          affect FN mRNA levels (Fig. 3F). 
          In vivo , immunostaining for FN, 3
          days after making excision wounds, showed that levels of
          this protein are high in the healing tissues and that
          treatment with cCAF increased FN accumulation in the
          granulation tissue (Fig. 4A& 4B). Immunoblot analysis
          for FN extracted from excision wounds showed that by 3
          days after injury the cCAF-treated wounds contained more
          FN than the control wounds but that the levels by 7 days
          are similar to those of the control (Fig. 4C).
          Taken together the results in culture and 
          in vivo suggest that the chemokine
          does not stimulate FN gene expression but rather may
          directly or indirectly affect stability of this protein.
          Therefore, we tested the possibility that cCAF treatment
          leads to stability of the protein by stimulating decrease
          in matrix degrading enzymes. In chickens, plasmin
          generated from plasminogen by plasminogen activator (PA)
          degrades much of the FN. To investigate whether activity
          of PA might be decreased with cCAF treatment leading to
          accumulation of FN, we examined the levels of PA
          activity. Our results showed that there is no detectable
          PA activity in untreated or treated fibroblasts whereas
          the activity is high in RSV-transformed CEFs (tCEFs; Fig.
          5A) which are known to produce high levels of PA [ 31 ] .
          Because PA does not appear to be activated by cCAF, we
          tested the possibility that the stability of FN is due to
          a decrease in MMP production/activation. In humans,
          MMP-3, MMP-7 and MMP-10 (stromelysins) are the most
          active proteases for FN, but these molecules have not
          been isolated in chickens. However, we can test for
          general activity of these MMPs in the chicken system by
          zymography using casein as substrate (Fig. 5B). Whereas
          the positive control (trypsin) was able to digest the
          substrate at specific sites in the gel, the supernatants
          of our treated fibroblasts did not. This suggests that
          the stromelysins are not active in this system or that
          our test is not sensitive enough. To further investigate
          whether MMPs are involved in the cCAF induced high levels
          of FN will require evaluation of matrix-degrading enzymes
          specific for chickens and is an ongoing project in our
          laboratory as we obtain/develop probes for theses MMPs.
          However, another possible mechanism for the cCAF-induced
          FN accumulation could be linked to an increase in TN.
          TN-C knockout mice show decreased accumulation of FN in
          wounded tissue and this decrease has been hypothesized to
          be due to disrupted incorporation of FN into the matrix
          in the absence of TN-C [ 32 33 ] . To determine whether
          cCAF-induced TN production is involved in the increase in
          FN observed after cCAF treatment, we used antisense
          phosphothioated oligonucleotides to inhibit TN
          production. Sense oligonucleotides did not have an effect
          on cCAF-induced TN or FN production. However, the
          antisense oligonucleotides were able to significantly
          decrease the production of both TN and FN (Fig. 5C).
        
        
          Effects of cCAF and its peptides on the production
          of Colls I and III
          To determine whether cCAF stimulates fibroblasts to
          produce increased levels of Colls I and III, we treated
          cultures as for TN. Immunoblot analysis for Coll I showed
          that cCAF, but not the N- or C-peptides, caused a small
          increase in Coll I protein levels (Fig. 6A). Probing the
          same blots for Coll III revealed no cCAF-induced
          difference in the level of production of this protein
          (Fig. 6B). 
          In vivo, Coll I was also slightly
          increased by treatment with the chemokine at 3 days after
          wounding but did not increase to higher levels than the
          control at 7 days, whereas the same blots probed for Coll
          III showed similar levels in treated and control at both
          3 and 7 days (Figure 6C).
          The effect on Coll I could be due to remodeling of
          this protein by proteases induced by the chemokine.
          Therefore, we tested whether cCAF affects the production
          or activity of the gelatinases MMP-2 or MMP-9, or the
          collagenase MMP-1, all of which digest collagens I and
          III. Using zymography, we found that treatment with cCAF
          or the peptides does not alter the levels of proMMP-2 and
          there was no detectable levels of proMMP-9 (Fig. 7A).
          However, immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal antibody
          to human MMP-1 (this reagent is not available for the
          chicken homologue of this matrix metalloproteinase)
          showed that cCAF treatment caused a decrease in the
          amount of the collagenase MMP-1 detected, but neither
          TIMP-1 nor TIMP-2 (two natural inhibitors of these MMPs)
          levels were changed, as evaluated by immunoblot analysis
          with a monoclonal antibody to the corresponding human
          proteins (Fig. 7B).
        
        
          Effects of cCAF on migration of fibroblasts
          During healing, fibroblasts migrate into and within
          the wounded tissue and lay down the extracellular matrix
          that forms the granulation tissue. These ECM molecules,
          especially TN and FN together, stimulate cell migration,
          thereby facilitating the entrance and movement of
          additional fibroblasts and of endothelial cells into the
          wound tissue. Because tissues treated with cCAF have more
          FN and TN at the time that these cells are entering the
          wound and chemokines are well known for their
          chemoattractant properties [ 34 35 ] , we tested whether
          cCAF stimulates chemotaxis of fibroblasts using transwell
          assays. To avoid effects of gravity on cell migration,
          the top chamber was inverted, the cells were plated on
          the underside of the membrane, allowed to adhere to it
          and then the chamber was turned right side up. The cells
          were incubated overnight in standard medium to allow
          expression of the cCAF receptor(s) and the following day
          cCAF was applied at increasing doses (100-1000 ng/ml) to
          the top chamber only. The migration assays were carried
          out for 24 hrs. We found that cCAF stimulated migration
          of the fibroblasts up the concentration gradient in a
          dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8A). To test whether the
          cCAF-induced effect is due to chemotaxis, we repeated the
          transwell assay and compared cell migration when cCAF is
          added to both wells. Placing cCAF in both wells abrogated
          cell migration, strongly suggesting that this protein
          chemoattracts fibroblasts (Fig 8B). We also tested the
          effects of the chemokine on migration by using the
          cloning ring assay. In a specified length of time, cells
          treated with cCAF moved a longer distance than did
          control cells, corroborating the previous results that
          the chemokine stimulates cell motility (Fig. 8C). 
          In situ hybridization for cCAF
          showed that the migrating fibroblasts also express higher
          levels of cCAF (Fig. 8D& 8E; see also ref. [ 36 ]
          ).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The work presented here shows that cCAF, the IL-8 of
        chickens, stimulates expression of several ECM molecules
        important in development of the granulation tissue. We show
        that: 
        (i) cCAF stimulates TN expression and
        that a 15 aa peptide containing the N-terminal sequence
        causes the same effects as the whole molecule; 
        (ii) in contrast to its effects on TN
        production, cCAF-induced increase in FN and Coll I
        accumulation requires the whole molecule; 
        (iii) the increase in FN protein is not
        a result of a corresponding increase in mRNA, or increase
        in MMP production or PA activity but appears to be linked
        TN production; 
        (iv) increase in Coll I correlates with
        decreased levels of MMP-1; 
        (v) cCAF chemoattracts fibroblasts and
        accelerates their migration; 
        (vi) treatment of excision wounds with
        cCAF increased the levels of all three ECM molecules in the
        granulation tissue of wounds albeit with different
        dynamics. This is the first demonstration that treatment of
        wounds with a pro-inflammatory and angiogenic chemokine
        accelerates development of the granulation tissue during
        healing by stimulating the precocious deposition of ECM
        molecules that are critical for proper healing.
        We showed previously that cCAF is highly expressed in
        the granulation tissue of wounds [ 6 36 ] , that this
        chemokine and several of its human homologues stimulate
        differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts both in
        culture and 
        in vivo, and that the latter effect
        can be achieved very effectively by the N-terminal 15aas of
        the protein [ 4 37 ] . In addition to cCAF, other CXC
        chemokines have been associated with wound healing events.
        In the granulation tissue of burn wounds, expression of
        groα /MGSA and CXCR2 (the receptor for MGSA) was associated
        with fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells/myofibroblasts and a
        subpopulation of macrophages [ 7 ] . Groα/MGSA and IL-8
        have also been shown to enhance re-epithelialization of
        human skin grafts in chimeric mice [ 29 38 ] . It has also
        been found that several CXC chemokines can modulate
        angiogenesis [ 39 ] , a process that is critical for proper
        healing. Some CXC chemokines, such as IL-8 and cCAF, are
        angiogenic 
        in vivo [ 3 39 40 41 ] . Others, such
        as IP-10 (interferon-γ10) and PF-4 (platelet factor-4), are
        anti-angiogenic. In the case of IP-10, it has been shown
        that in transgenic mice treated with this chemokine, wounds
        heal poorly and exhibit defects in angiogenesis and
        development of the granulation tissue [ 8 ] .
        Work of others has shown that TN is expressed in
        association with differentiation of myofibroblasts and is
        important in cell migration during healing [ 25 42 43 44 ]
        . Here we show that cCAF and the N-peptide stimulate
        fibroblasts in culture to express TN and that this increase
        in TN is due to an increase in mRNA levels. The increase is
        lower for C-peptide treated cells; after 3 days in an
        environment mimicking the wound, these cells had lesser but
        significant tenascin protein levels, most likely due to the
        small increase seen in mRNA. In addition, in wounds treated
        with the chemokine, TN levels are much higher at early
        times after wounding but drop by 7 days after wounding. At
        this stage, the wounds are closed and are beginning to
        remodel in the cCAF-treated wounds while the granulation
        tissue in the control wings is still maturing. These data
        taken together strongly suggest that as chemokines induce
        the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts they
        contribute to the production of TN in the granulation
        tissue. Our finding that the N-terminal peptide is able to
        stimulate expression of TN much like the whole protein is
        potentially important because this small peptide may be
        useful to develop therapeutic agonists or antagonists for
        wound healing.
        The effect of cCAF treatment on Coll I accumulation in
        culture and in wounded tissues is small but reproducible.
        Because MMP-1 levels were also decreased by cCAF treatment,
        it is possible that the small rise in Coll I levels is due
        to decreased degradation of this ECM molecule by the
        collagenase. Another chemokine that has been associated
        with Coll I production is monocyte chemotactic protein 1
        (MCP-1). This chemokine belongs to the CC chemokine family
        and stimulates Coll I production both by lung fibroblasts
        taken from areas of inflammation [ 26 ] and in kidneys that
        suffer from crescentic nephritis [ 45 ] . The former
        investigators reported that MCP-1 increases collagen
        accumulation not by decreasing the levels of the
        collagenase MMP-1, but by stimulating the production of
        TGFβ1, a well-known stimulator of collagen expression and
        expression of TIMPs, the natural inhibitors of MMPs. In
        addition to MCP-1, IL-8 and MGSA have also been evaluated
        for production of collagen [ 46 ] . These investigators
        reported that treatment of normal fibroblasts with these
        chemokines did not affect collagen levels. It is not clear
        from their results whether the elevation in collagen
        production in normal fibroblasts may have been small, like
        that observed with cCAF, and therefore gone unnoticed.
        FN accumulation due to cCAF treatment also differs from
        that of TN. The FN mRNA levels are not affected by cCAF
        treatment but the protein accumulates in culture and in the
        granulation tissue of wounds upon exposure to the
        chemokine. By analogy with the increase in Coll I, we
        hypothesized that decrease in protease levels/activity is
        involved in the accumulation of FN. Plasmin resulting from
        cleavage of plasminogen by plasminogen activator (PA) is
        the major enzyme affecting FN degradation in chickens.
        However, testing for decrease in PA activity showed that
        this enzyme is not activated even in the controls,
        therefore, it is unlikely that this would be a major
        mechanism involved in degrading FN. In humans, there are
        several MMPs that are known to degrade FN. We found that
        MMP-2 levels are unaffected by cCAF treatment and that
        there is no detectable MMP-3, -7 and -10 activity as
        evaluated by casein zymography using tCEFs as control for
        production of these stromelysins. Another FN-degrading
        metalloproteinase, MT-MMP1, is unlikely to be involved
        because it also activates MMP-2 and this enzyme is not
        activated by cCAF treatment.
        Another possible mechanism that may explain FN
        accumulation could be an increase in TN. TN-C knockout mice
        show decreased accumulation of FN in wounded tissue and
        this decrease has been hypothesized to be due to disrupted
        incorporation on FN into the matrix in the absence of TN-C
        [ 32 33 ] . Therefore, our observation that inhibition of
        cCAF-induced TN production decreases the accumulation of FN
        supports the findings in the knockout mice. However, this
        does not explain the unchanged FN levels with the N-peptide
        treatment. One possible explanation for these findings
        could relate to the fact that FN does not self-assemble.
        Therefore, it is possible that alterations in the
        activities of integrins or adhesive sites on other ECM
        molecules induced by the whole cCAF molecule, and not by
        the N-peptide, could affect FN accumulation [ 47 ] . We are
        currently pursuing studies to determine whether adhesion
        molecules or other ECM molecules play a role in FN
        accumulation due to cCAF-induced TN production.
        Migration of fibroblasts from the area surrounding the
        wound into the wound site is critical in order for
        remodeling of the extracellular matrix and for wound
        contraction to occur. TN and FN, especially in combination,
        promote migration, therefore cCAF may facilitate fibroblast
        migration by increasing TN and FN levels. However, this
        chemokine is also able to chemoattract fibroblasts and
        accelerate their migration in the absence of these
        molecules, strongly suggesting that it contributes to
        fibroblast movement independently of the deposition of
        these ECM molecule. These findings suggest that during
        wound healing, cCAF produced by the resident fibroblasts
        chemoattracts additional fibroblasts that contribute to the
        production of these ECM molecules, which then support
        migration of both fibroblasts and other cells in the wound
        tissue.
        TGFβ1 is another factor known to stimulate myofibroblast
        differentiation, ECM production and accelerate wound
        closure and healing. However, this growth factor has a
        strong inflammatory effect that leads to excess fibrosis
        and scarring. In addition to greatly increasing
        accumulation of Colls I and III, TGFβ1 has been shown to
        also increase FN and TN production. cCAF (and maybe other
        chemokines), on the other hand, may have a subtler, more
        controlled effect, promoting the earlier appearance of a
        normal granulation tissue without leading to excess matrix
        accumulation and scarring.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our results strongly suggest that cCAF plays an
        important role in wound repair by activating fibroblasts to
        form early granulation tissue, through cell migration,
        myofibroblast differentiation and production/accumulation
        of ECM molecules that are critical for proper development
        of the healing tissue of wounds. This is a previously
        unknown role for chemokines and, unlike other inflammatory
        factors that promote granulation tissue formation, cCAF
        does not appear to stimulate increased fibrosis. If similar
        behavior is seen in human chemokines, it could be a
        promising target in designing drugs that promote formation
        of granulation tissue in poorly healing wounds without
        causing excess scarring.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Reagents
          All tissue culture supplies and the TRIzol reagent
          were purchased from Gibco-BRL. cCAF and the N-terminal
          peptide (15a.a.) were synthesized by Gryphon Sciences
          (San Francisco, CA) and C-terminus peptide (28a.a) was
          made by Milligen Biosearch (San Rafael, CA). Secondary
          antibodies used: anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horseradish
          peroxidase, anti-mouse Texas Red (Amersham: Piscataway,
          NJ) and anti-mouse FITC (DAKO: Carpinteria, CA). Primary
          antibodies used: mouse anti-chicken Coll I, Coll III, FN,
          and TN (Hybridoma Bank, Iowa), rabbit anti-chicken TN
          (Chemicon, Temecula CA). Rabbit anti-human MMP-1 and
          TIMP-2 and mouse anti-human TIMP-1 were the kind gift of
          Dr. Tai-Lan Tuan. The ECL reagents were purchased from
          Amersham; Vectashield mounting medium from Vector
          Laboratories (Burlingame, CA); DC protein assay kit from
          Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA); Biocoat and Transwells from
          Fisher and Biocclusive bandage from Johnson&Johnson
          Medical (Arlington, TX).
        
        
          Cell culture
          Primary chicken embryonic fibroblasts were cultured as
          previously described [ 3 4 ] . Briefly, primary
          fibroblasts were isolated from 10-day-old chicken embryos
          and cultured for 4 days. These cultures were passaged
          once and used as secondary cultures at a density of 0.3 ×
          106 cells/35 mm plate. Due to the use of primary cells
          rather than cell lines, there are variations in cellular
          responses between sets of cells. Therefore, internal
          controls were always included and results from different
          batches of cells were not averaged. Secondary cultures
          were treated with 750 ng/ml cCAF [68 nM] or its terminal
          peptides in 199/tryptose phosphate broth and 2% donor
          calf serum. This dose of cCAF was chosen because it was
          the optimal dose for inducing differentiation of
          myofibroblasts, cells known to produce large amounts of
          ECM [ 4 ] . Media was changed and new cCAF or peptides
          added every day for 4 days.
        
        
          Immunoblotting
          Proteins were extracted from the cells after 4 days of
          treatment, using 150 mM RIPA buffer containing protease
          inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined using
          the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and samples were
          adjusted to contain equal amounts of protein. Proteins
          were separated on 7.5% Doucet gels [ 48 ] and transferred
          to nitrocellulose was performed using a wet-transfer
          apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 45 min. The membranes
          were blocked for 1 h in 5% milk in TTBS and then
          incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibody (1:50
          anti-Coll I, anti-Coll III and anti-FN, 1:100 TIMP-1,
          1:500 anti-MMP-1 and anti-TIMP-2, 1:1000 anti-TN), in 1%
          milk in TTBS. The membranes were washed 3 times for 10
          min each with TTBS, incubated in anti-mouse or
          anti-rabbit HRP (1:10,000) in 1% milk for 1 hr and washed
          as above, the bands visualized using the ECL (Amersham).
          Densitometry was performed using BandScan software
          (Glyko).
        
        
          Immunostaining
          At the end of treatment, the cells were rinsed with
          PBS, fixed and permeabilized in 4% paraformaldehyde with
          0.15% Triton X-100. After fixation, the cells were washed
          and then incubated with PBS containing 0.1 M glycine for
          10 min. Cells were blocked for 30 min with 10% goat serum
          in PBS, incubated with primary antibody (1:100) in
          1%BSA/PBS for 1 hr at room temperature (RT), and washed
          three times with 0.1% BSA/PBS for 10 min each. The cells
          were then incubated in secondary antibody in 1% BSA/PBS
          for 1 hr at RT, washed three times for 10 min with 0.1%
          BSA in PBS and mounted with Vectashield.
        
        
          Zymography
          Zymography was performed using denaturing
          polyacrylamide gels according to the protocol of ref. [
          49 ] . Gels to test for gelatinolytic activity contained
          1% gelatin (Sigma) and those that tested for caseinolytic
          activity had 1% casein (Sigma). 5 μl of 0.25%
          trypsin-EDTA (Gibco-BRL) was used as a positive control
          for the casein zymogram.
        
        
          Plasminogen activity assay
          A chromogenic plasminogen activator substrate
          (Boc-Val-Gly-Arg-βNA.AcOH) was purchased from Calbiochem.
          50 μl of a 10 mM stock solution of substrate in water was
          added to 200 μl 0.1 mM HEPES buffer pH 8.0 and heated to
          25°C. 25 μl fibroblast substrate was added to the
          substrate and incubated for 30 min. Absorbance was then
          read at 405 nm. Positive control: Supernatant from Rous
          sarcoma virus-transformed CEFs (tCEFs), which are known
          to produce high levels of PA.
        
        
          Inhibition of TN expression
          For these experiments we used phosphothioated
          antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), synthesized and
          HPLC purified by Sigma Genosys, to block the TN
          production. The sequences for the oligonucleotides were
          the same as previously described [ 50 ] except that we
          used phosphothioated oligos rather than morpholino
          oligos. The antisense sequence of the ODN was
          5'-GGAGTCCCATTGTAGTGCTCAGTTC-3'. The sense strand of this
          ODN was used as control
          (5'-GAACTGAGCACTACAATGGGACTCC-3'). When preparing the
          cell cultures, 1 μM and 2 μM of antisense or sense ODN
          were added to the cells at plating. The cells where
          treated with antisense or sense ODN and cCAF every 24 hrs
          for 3 days to allow accumulation of the ECM
          molecules.
        
        
          Northerns
          Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent from
          untreated fibroblasts and fibroblasts treated with 750
          ng/ml cCAF for 4-48 hrs. Transfer of RNA to membrane was
          performed as previously described [ 51 ] . RNA probes
          were made using the Strip-EZ kit from Ambion (Arlington,
          TX). Membranes were prehybridized for 2 hrs in Ambion
          Hybridization buffer at 62°C, and hybridized O/N at 62°C.
          Membranes were washed with 2 × SSC/0.1% SDS at 62°C and
          exposed to film for 6-48 hrs.
        
        
          RT-PCR
          Total RNA was extracted as above. RT-PCR was performed
          using the Promega Access RT-PCR System, following
          Promega's instructions. The first strand was synthesized
          at 48°C and DNA was amplified at 95°C 45 sec, 55°C 1 min,
          68°C 1.5 min for 40 cycles. 3 μl Quantum mRNA classic 18S
          primers from Ambion were used to quantify total RNA
          levels. Primers used for TN amplification: sense
          5'AAATGCATCTGCGAGGGC, antisense
          5"GGAAGCTTGTTATTGCAGTCCTTCGG [ 41 ] .
        
        
          Wounding experiment
          Full-thickness excision wounds (approximately 0.5 ×
          0.5 cm) were made on the underside of the wings of 2
          week-old chicks, using a scalpel blade. The left wing was
          treated with vehicle alone, and the right wing with 1 μg
          cCAF. The wounds were photographed immediately after
          wounding and then covered with Biocclusive bandage. 50 μl
          vehicle or cCAF were deposited through the bandage onto
          the wound using a 30-gauge needle. This procedure was
          repeated the next day and every other day thereafter on
          days 3, 5 and 7. Samples were collected at days 3 and 7
          post-wounding for ECM analysis. All experimental work
          with animals reported here was done under full compliance
          with our animal protocol approved by appropriate campus
          authorities.
        
        
          Preparation and staining of wing sections
          At the specified time points, chickens were euthanized
          with sodium pentobarbitol. The wounded wings were
          collected and fixed for 18 hrs in 4% paraformaldehyde and
          decalcified for 3 days in 5% formic acid, 2.5%
          formaldehyde at 4°C. The tissue was embedded in paraffin
          and sectioned. Sections were stained with Masson
          Trichrome to visualize interstitial collagen. Other
          sections were immunolabeled for FN or TN. Sections were
          deparaffinized in 3 changes of Hemo-De for 15 min each
          and rehydrated in a descending ethanol series (5 min
          each: 100%, 95%, 70%, 50%, 30% ethanol). After rinsing
          with PBS, sections were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for
          1 hr. Autofluorescence and non-specific staining were
          blocked for 30 min in 0.1 M glycine in PBS, followed by
          30 min in 1% Evans Blue in PBS to quench red blood cell
          autofluorescence. Sections were incubated with anti-FN or
          anti-TN antibodies (1:50) in 1% BSA in PBS for 2 hr at
          room temperature. After 3 × 10 min washes in 0.1% BSA in
          PBS, the sections were incubated for 40 min with
          anti-mouse Alexa antibody (1:200) in 1% BSA in PBS. They
          were then washed and mounted with Vectashield.
        
        
          Protein extracts of wounds
          Wound tissues were immediately frozen on dry ice and
          stored at -70°C. To extract protein, the tissue was
          ground with glass beads in a mortar and pestle on dry
          ice. The powdered tissue was dissolved in RIPA containing
          300 mM salt and a cocktail of protease inhibitors, and
          vortexed vigorously. After centrifugation, the
          supernatant was used in immunoblots.
        
        
          Transwell assay for migration
          1 × 10 6cells in 100 μl 199 medium containing 2% serum
          were plated on the underside of transwell membranes by
          inverting the insert. They were allowed to adhere for 30
          minutes, then the well was turned right side up and both
          sides of the well were filled with serum-containing
          medium. The cells were allowed to recover for 24 hrs, and
          express the cCAF receptors. Then the medium in the top
          well was changed to serum-free medium containing 50-1000
          ng/ml cCAF or 2 % serum (positive control); serum free
          medium alone was placed in the bottom well. The cells
          were allowed to migrate towards the chemoattractant for
          24 hrs. The cells on the underside of the membrane were
          removed with a cotton swab. The membranes were then fixed
          and stained with 2% toludine blue in formaldehyde. To
          determine the number of migrated cells, all cells on the
          upper side of the membrane were counted. Control for
          chemotaxis was performed by adding 1000 ng/ml cCAF to
          both wells of the Transwell unit.
        
        
          Cloning ring assay for migration
          1 × 10 6cells in 100 μl 199 medium containing 2% serum
          were plated in a cloning ring in a 35 mm plate. They were
          allowed to adhere for 1 hour, then the ring was removed,
          the culture medium added to the plate and the cells
          photographed on a phase-contrast microscope to record the
          area of the cells and the edge of the ring. cCAF was then
          added at various doses (0-1000 ng/ml). The following day
          the medium was changed and the cells were treated again.
          On the third day after plating, the cells were
          photographed once more before the experiment was
          terminated. To determine the extent of cell migration, we
          measured the distance between the edge where the cloning
          ring was at day zero and the edge of the culture
          delineated by the migrating front of the cells on the 3
          rdday.
        
        
          In situhybridization
          Fibroblast cultures and probes were prepared as
          described previously (Martins-Green and Bissell, 1990).
          Briefly, probes were prepared as follows: 1 μg of
          pGEM1/cCAF cDNA was transcribed for 1 1/2 h at 37°C in a
          cocktail containing 100 μM each of 3H-ATP and 3H-UTP
          (Amersham Corp.), 1 mM each GTP and CTP, 120 mM
          dithiothreitol, and 100 U of T7 polymerase (Amersham
          Corop.). The probe was separated from the free
          nucleotides in a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with
          50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane pH 8.0, 15 mM
          NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. For 
          in situ hybridization, cells were
          fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 5 mM MgCl 
          2 , incubated in 0.1 M glycine for 10
          min, dehydrated 3 min each in 30, 70, and 100% ethanol,
          and allowed to dry. Prehybridization was performed in a
          solution containing 60% formamide, 0.1 M piperazine- 
          N,N' -bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) pH
          6.4, 0.4 M NaCl, and 0.2 mg/ml of 
          E. coli tRNA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
          for 2 h at 55°C with gentle shaking. The hybridization
          solution was the same as the prehybridization solution
          but contained 10 6cpm/ml of the cCAF probe or with the
          same number of counts of the vector probe and incubated
          at 55°C for 48 h with gentle shaking. At the end of this
          period, the cultures were washed twice with 2× SSC + 0.1%
          Triton-X 100 for 1 h followed by two more washes with
          0.1× SSC + 0.1% Triton-X 100, all at 55°C in the shaker.
          The cultures were allowed to dry, then covered with
          emulsion and processed as described previously [ 6 ]
          .
