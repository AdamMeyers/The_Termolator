        Affymetrix microarrays are used by many laboratories to
        study differences in gene expression associated with
        experimental treatments, diseases, development, aging, and
        other conditions. Typically, an arbitrary value for
        expression ratios (or fold-change values) is chosen to
        define significant differences in gene expression between
        conditions. For example, in several studies of aging [ 1 2
        3 4 5 6 ] , only differences > 1.7-fold in magnitude
        were considered to be significant. None of the reports
        indicated whether there were smaller effects that were
        statistically significant. It has been pointed out that
        statistically significant differences in gene expression
        often are of small magnitude (sometimes as low as
        1.2-fold), and that larger effects often are artefacts of
        high variance [ 7 8 ] . For those interested in detecting
        these smaller effects, it is important to minimize
        nonspecific sources of inter-array variance.
        To understand the approach described in this report, it
        is necessary to understand the design of Affymetrix
        microarrays and analysis software (Microarray Suite). There
        are multiple probe pairs for each mRNA (8-20 for the arrays
        used in the present study). A probe pair consists of a 25
        base oligonucleotide that matches an mRNA sequence (perfect
        match, or PM probe) and an oligonucleotide with a
        mismatched base in the center (MM probe). The specific
        hybridization signal for each probe pair is the difference
        between the PM intensity and the MM intensity (although the
        latest version of Affymetrix Microarray Suite, 5.0, has
        special rules for handling MM probes that have higher
        signals than their PM partner). No single hybridization
        condition is optimal for all oligonucleotide probes, so it
        is inevitable that there is variability among the signals
        within a probe set. The expression level reported for each
        probe set (by the Affymetrix "absolute analysis" algorithm)
        is based on a weighted average of the signals from the
        individual probe pairs, with signals near the median given
        more weight than those far from the median. We refer to
        this as the signal method in this report. The weights
        assigned to each probe pair can vary from one array to
        another, but it is unclear whether variable weighting adds
        significantly to inter-array variance. Microarray Suite
        also has a procedure ("comparative analysis" algorithm) for
        comparing two arrays at the level of individual probe
        pairs. With this algorithm, ratios of signals (PM-MM for
        each probe pair) from one array to those of the other array
        are computed first. Weighted averages of these ratios are
        then computed. We refer to this as the ratio method. This
        method is supposed to be more precise than the signal
        method for inter-array comparisons. Thus, many
        investigators use this algorithm for all possible
        one-to-one comparisons across groups (e.g., 9 comparisons
        for 3 arrays per group) and report the average of the
        ratios as the change in gene expression [ 1 2 3 4 5 9 ] . A
        problem with this approach is that there is no absolute or
        relative expression level assigned to each mRNA on
        individual arrays, so that formal statistical approaches
        (e.g., t-tests) cannot be used to rate the statistical
        significance of differences. In this report, we describe
        how we circumvented this problem by using the ratio method
        to generate a composite gene expression score for each mRNA
        on each array.
        The procedure used to estimate the statistical
        significance of differences determines which genes, and how
        many genes, are defined as being differentially expressed.
        For a comparison between two groups, the t-test is the most
        commonly used procedure in biological research. However,
        with 6 arrays per group, even a single outlier can markedly
        reduce the value of t even when there is no overlap between
        groups. Therefore, we also used the nonparametric rank sum
        test, which is insensitive to a skewed distribution. False
        detection rates were estimated with the Significance
        Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program [ 8 ] .
      
      
        Results
        
          Normalization method
          Comparisons among arrays are meaningful only after
          accounting for variability in overall target
          concentration ("target" is the Affymetrix nomenclature
          for a labeled cRNA that hybridizes with a probe),
          hybridization efficiency, staining, etc. The
          normalization procedure recommended by Affymetrix is to
          multiply raw signals by a scaling factor such that the
          trimmed mean (excluding 2% highest and 2% lowest) of
          signals is always the same (500 in this study). This
          procedure could be problematic if a variable proportion
          (>2%) of the signals are beyond the linear range of
          the system. Another concern about the normalization
          procedure was that the majority of the targets did not
          produce signals that were significantly greater than
          those caused by nonspecific hybridization. After the
          recommended normalization procedure was applied, we
          confirmed that there was negligible inter-array
          variability of the mean signal (with 5% of signals
          trimmed from both the high and low ends) across the 4629
          targets that passed the presence / absence filter
          (described in the next section). The trimmed mean was 649
          ± 14 (standard deviation) arbitrary units for the 6
          arrays probing RNA from young muscle, and 643 ± 18 for
          the 6 arrays probing RNA from older muscle. These data
          were not used to re-scale the arrays because the variance
          would have been reduced by less than 2%. Plots of signals
          from individual arrays versus the average of all 12
          arrays generally showed the expected scatter around the
          line of identity (Figure 1A), but a few showed systematic
          deviations either above or below the line of identity for
          signals > ~10 4arbitrary units (worst-case array shown
          in Figure 1B). While this problem might be addressed by
          using a different scaling factor for high-intensity
          signals [ 10 ] , few targets produced such high signals,
          and the magnitude of the effect was small. Thus, the
          Affymetrix normalization method was employed without
          modification.
        
        
          Exclusion of targets based on the absolute
          detection algorithm
          Microarray Suite estimates probabilities that targets
          are absent (P 
          detection ) based on ratios of signals
          from PM probes to those of MM probes, together with the
          degree of consistency across the multiple probe pairs for
          each target. As illustrated in Figure 2, the average
          signal from the multiple probe pairs cannot be used to
          decide whether a target should be considered present or
          absent. We restricted the data analyses to targets for
          which P 
          detection was less than 0.1 for at
          least 3 of the 6 samples from either the younger or older
          group. This filter reduced the number of targets included
          in the statistical analyses to 4629. While excluding data
          does not affect the nominal value of P for each
          comparison made with a t-test or rank sum test, it
          significantly reduces the estimated false detection rate
          (see 
          t-Tests and 
          SAM below).
        
        
          Signal method vs. ratio method
          When two arrays are compared, the gene expression
          ratios obtained by the signal method and those obtained
          by the ratio method (see 
          Background for explanation of terms)
          are highly correlated. However, the results often differ
          by more than 1.5-fold (Figure 3). The advantage of the
          signal method is that Microarray Suite provides, for each
          target, a number describing the level of gene expression
          (in arbitrary units) that can be used for t-tests or
          other statistical procedures. However, according to
          Affymetrix (Microarray Suite 5.0 User's Guide),
          comparisons between arrays are more precise when the
          ratio method is used, so the values on the horizontal
          axis of Figure 3should be more accurate. The Affymetrix
          ratio method only provides ratios between two arrays, and
          does not provide gene expression values for the
          individual arrays that can be used with standard tests of
          statistical significance. We therefore extended the ratio
          method to generate a relative expression score for each
          target on each array, as follows:
          The first step was to name one of the arrays as the
          baseline in the comparative analysis program (Microarray
          Suite 5.0). Every other array included in the study was
          then compared with that baseline array. This procedure
          yielded, for each target, a set of 11 expression ratios (
          
          r ) representing the relative
          expression level on each array compared with the baseline
          array.
          The next step was to compute, for each target, the
          expression level ( 
          R ) of the baseline array relative
          to all 12 arrays included in the study. For array #1, 
          R was computed with the
          formula:
          
          R 
          1 = 12/(1 + 
          r 
          2 vs. 1 + 
          r 
          3 vs. 1 + ... + 
          r 
          12 vs. 1 )
          The value of 1 in the denominator of this formula
          represents the comparison of array #1 with itself. The
          number of arrays is the numerator rather than the
          denominator in this formula because the Affymetrix
          comparative analysis program sets the baseline array as
          the denominator, so that values of 
          r are the inverse of the relevant
          ratios.
          A different array was then named as the baseline.
          E.g., for array #2 as the baseline:
          
          R 
          2 = 12/( 
          r 
          1 vs. 2 + 1 + 
          r 
          3 vs. 2 + ... + 
          r 
          12 vs. 2 )
          These steps were repeated until all 12 arrays had been
          named as the baseline. The values R 
          1 through R 
          12 were then used for comparisons
          between age groups with t-tests, rank sum tests, and SAM
          as described below.
          For the 4629 probe sets that passed the presence /
          absence filter, the expression ratios (mean value in old
          group / mean value in young group) generated by the
          signal method and those generated by the ratio method
          were highly correlated (r = 0.89). There also was a
          fairly good correlation between the signal and ratio
          methods with respect to the level of statistical
          significance (log P) of the age-related differences (r =
          0.74). The advantage of the ratio method was that it
          usually reduced the within-group variance so that the
          same mean difference between young and old was associated
          with a higher level of statistical significance. The
          average within-group coefficient of variation (CV,
          standard deviation / mean) was 20% with the ratio method
          and 25% with the signal method (average CVs were the same
          for young and old groups). The distribution of CVs
          improved significantly with the ratio method (Figure 4).
          Table 1shows that more differences were detected by the
          ratio method whether we used t-tests, rank sum tests, or
          SAM to define significant differences. Moreover,
          consistency between the initial scan and the
          antibody-enhanced scan was significantly improved by the
          ratio method, for both expression ratios and for the
          statistical significance of differences between young and
          old (Table 2). With the signal method, 38% of the
          differences significant at P < 0.01 (by t-test) on the
          initial scan were also significant at P < 0.01 on the
          antibody-enhanced scan, and 65% were significant at P
