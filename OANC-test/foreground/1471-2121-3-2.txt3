        The precursor of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor
        (proHB-EGF) is found on a wide variety of cell surfaces and
        is present in numerous tissue types [ 1 ] . Previously in
        our laboratory, we cloned the cDNA encoding proHB-EGF from
        monkey Vero cells and identified this cell-surface molecule
        as a receptor for diphtheria toxin (DT) [ 2 ] . The
        predicted amino acid sequence was shown to be identical to
        that of the cell surface-expressed precursor of human
        heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (proHB-EGF) [ 3 4 ]
        . The derived amino acid sequence revealed a signal
        sequence (residues 1-23), an extracellular domain (residues
        24-159), a transmembrane domain (residues 160-184), and a
        carboxyl terminal cytoplasmic domain (residues 185-208) [ 2
        ] . Proteolytic processing of the proHB-EGF occurs on the
        cell surface and results in the release of mature HB-EGF
        (mHB-EGF) (residues 63-148) [ 5 ] . The mature/soluble
        HB-EGF is a member of the EGF family of growth factors that
        includes amphiregulin, epidermal growth factor, and
        transforming growth factor a [ 6 ] . Mature HB-EGF released
        from the cell surface is mitogenic and is able to bind to
        the EGF receptor [ 3 ] . Membrane-bound proHB-EGF has
        juxtacrine growth factor activity [ 7 ] and also acts as a
        DT receptor [ 2 8 ] .
        Previously we have described the interaction of the
        extracellular domain of proHB-EGF with the second
        extracellular domain of the tetraspanin protein, monkey CD9
        [ 9 ] . Tissue culture experiments using DT-sensitive
        transfected mouse fibroblast cell lines expressing on the
        cell surface both the monkey DT receptor and chimeric
        mouse-monkey CD9 antigen showed that the second
        extracellular domain of monkey CD9 antigen is able to act
        as a coreceptor for DT and is also responsible for the
        increased DT-sensitivity and affinity for DT in these cell
        lines [ 9 ] . These observations suggested that the CD9
        antigen and proHB-EGF likely interact physically on the
        cell surface. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we have
        shown that the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF and the
        second extracellular domain of monkey CD9 do indeed
        interact [ 9 ] .
        The yeast two-hybrid system strategy has been used to
        examine both intracellular and receptor-ligand
        protein-protein interactions. The interaction of mammalian
        growth hormone, prolactin, and vascular endothelial growth
        factor with their respective extracellular ligand-binding
        proteins have been observed using yeast two-hybrid sytems [
        10 11 12 13 ] .
        The involvement of HB-EGF in various cellular and tissue
        functions and its presence in extracellular matrices
        suggested the possibility that it may interact with other
        extracellular matrix proteins. To test this possiblity we
        used the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF in a yeast
        two-hybrid system to screen a monkey kidney cDNA library.
        In the present report, we have identified two novel
        extracellular matrix proteins latent transforming growth
        factor β-binding protein 3 and fibulin-1C that interact
        with the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Yeast two-hybrid screening of the monkey cDNA
          library using the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF as
          the bait fusion
          The initial screening of ≈ 3 × 10 6clones of the
          monkey cDNA library with the bait fusion of GAL4 binding
          domain fused to the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF
          yielded 294 colonies that were able to grow on Trp -His
          -Leu -media and that gave positive β-galactosidase
          activity in the β-galactosidase filter paper assay. False
          positives were ruled out by testing the β-galactosidase
          activity of the library clone alone or the library clone
          and the GAL4 DNA binding domain plasmid vector together
          in the yeast host strain. False positives were also ruled
          out by testing the β-galactosidase activity of the
          library clone with pVA3 (pGBT9 with a cloned insert). The
          elimination of these false positive colonies from the
          initial screening of the cDNA library resulted in a total
          of 64 colonies whose library clones encoded potentially
          true interacting proteins with the extracellular domain
          of proHB-EGF. Some of these cDNA library clones were
          transformed into the other yeast host strain, Y187, and
          tested for β-galactosidase activity as a further check
          that these clones did indeed contain potential
          protein-interacting partners for the extracellular domain
          of proHB-EGF.
        
        
          Detection of the physical interactions of proHB-EGF
          with CD9 antigens
          The membrane-bound precursor and soluble forms of
          heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth
          factor (HB-EGF) contribute to a variety of cellular
          developmental processes [ 1 ] . The observations of
          HB-EGF in cell and tissue types have suggested roles for
          HB-EGF in numerous cellular and tissue events such as:
          cell movement, extracellular matrix formation, tumor
          formation and cell adherence [ 1 ] . As described above,
          the membrane-bound precursor of HB-EGF (proHB-EGF) is
          also the cell-surface receptor for diphtheria toxin (DT)
          in DT-sensitive cells [ 2 ] .
          Previously we have examined the protein-protein
          interactions of proHB-EGF with the cell-surface CD9
          antigen [ 9 ] . The CD9 antigen is found on a wide
          variety of tissue and cell types and has been reported to
          be involved in such cellular processes as B-cell
          development, cell metastasis, platelet activation and
          adhesion, and cell motility [ 14 15 ] . CD9 antigen is a
          member of the tetraspanin superfamily and consists of two
          extracellular domains sandwiched between four
          highly-conserved hydrophobic transmembrane domains [ 14
          15 ] . The second extracellular domain (75-130 amino
          acids) is larger than the first extracellular domain
          (20-27 amino acids). Short cytoplasmic domains (5-14
          amino acids) are found at both the amino and carboxyl
          termini of CD9 [ 14 ] . As reported previously, we used a
          yeast two-hybrid system and observed interaction between
          the second extracellular domain of MkCD9 and the
          extracellular domain of proHB-EGF [ 9 ] . However,
          despite repeated attempts, using the yeast two-hybrid
          system, we were unable to show interaction between the
          amino terminal cytoplasmic domain of monkey CD9 and the
          cytoplasmic domain of proHB-EGF; these results may
          reflect the limitation of the yeast two-hybrid system as
          the insert sizes cloned into the vectors may be too small
          resulting in Gal4 fusion proteins whose "test subunits"
          are masked by the Gal4 subunit. This would result in the
          fusion proteins being unable to recognize each other.
          The results of screening the monkey cv-1 cDNA library
          with the bait plasmid pGBT9/DTREx were somewhat
          surprising in that no portions of the CD9 protein were
          represented among the proteins found to interact with the
          extracellular domain of proHB-EGF. These results may
          reflect improper folding of CD9 protein fragments encoded
          by cDNA inserts or these results may be due to under
          representation of the CD9 cDNA in the monkey cv-1 cDNA
          library. It was also surprising that the extracellular
          portion of any of the EGF receptor proteins was also not
          represented among the proteins found to interact with the
          extracellular domain of proHB-EGF, since the mature
          protein proteolytically cleaved from proHB-EGF (mHB-EGF)
          as well as the membrane bound form are known to interact
          with the EGF receptor.
        
        
          The extracellular domain of proHB-EGF interacts
          with monkey LTBP-3
          The positive interaction of the fragment of the latent
          transforming growth factor β-binding protein-3 (LTBP-3)
          with the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF was of great
          interest (Additional file 1). Recently it has been
          reported that treatment of EGF-responsive, nontransformed
          rat intestinal crypt cell line RIE-1 cells with TGF-β
          resulted in an increased level of expression of HB-EGF [
          16 ] . LTBP-3 is a protein that is ubiquitous in tissues
          and cells. Human LTBP-3 (Fig. 1) and mouse LTBP-3 contain
          1242 and 1251 amino acids, respectively, and each protein
          has five structural domains. Each has a signal sequence
          (55 amino acids and 49, respectively), a second domain
          containing an EGF-like repeat, a proline/glycine rich
          region, a fibrillin motif [ 17 ] , an EGF calcium-binding
          repeat, and a TGF-β repeat (390 and 389 amino acids,
          respectively), a third domain containing a
          proline/glycine rich region (113 and 111 amino acids,
          respectively), a fourth domain containing numerous
          calcium-binding type II EGF-like modules
          (D/N)(I/V)(D/N)(E/D)C 
          1 (678 and 677 amino acids,
          respectively) and a fifth carboxyl-terminal domain (5 and
          21 amino acids, respectively) (human LTBP-3 information
          was obtained from the GenBank database accession no.
          AF135960.2; [ 18 ] ). Colony hybridization experiments
          using the LTBP-3 probe (see materials and methods) and
          the monkey cv-1 cDNA library yielded a set of six (two
          identical) overlapping clones (Fig. 2). The amino acid
          sequence derived from the nucleotide sequence obtained
          for the monkey LTBP-3 sequence (GenBank accession number
          AF395658) shows it to share 98.6 % identity with the
          human LTBP-3 amino acid sequence (GenBank accession
          number NP_066548) and 86.7 % identity with the mouse
          LTBP-3 amino acid sequence (GenBank accession number
          NP_032546).
          The presence of the calcium-binding EGF-like modules
          in monkey LTBP-3 is noteworthy. It is well established
          that EGF-like modules are important structural features
          found in many extracellular proteins and that these
          modules enable numerous protein :protein interactions;
          the binding of EGF-like modules in laminin to nidogen [
          19 ] and the interaction of EGF-like modules within
          fibrillin monomers [ 20 21 ] . Calcium may be required
          for some of these protein interactions.
          At the time of writing, there have not been any
          reported interactions of these EGF-like modules in LTBP-3
          proteins with specific proteins. It is interesting that
          the combination of colony hybridization and yeast
          two-hybrid screens used in this study to identify
          proteins that interact with the extracellular domain of
          proHB-EGF yielded independent GAL4-LTBP-3 fusion proteins
          that all contained these calcium-binding type II EGF-like
          domains (Fig. 2). A constructed clone, pGAD424/LTBP-3
          EGF#1-8, that contained calcium-binding type EGF-like
          modules #1-8 fused to the GAL4-activation domain (see
          Fig. 1and materials and methods) was tested using the
          yeast two-hybrid system and found to interact with the
          extracellular domain of proHB-EGF (Additional file 1).
          These negatively-charged EGF-like modules of LTBP-3 may
          interact efficiently with the positively-charged
          heparin-binding domain of both the membrane-bound and
          soluble forms of HB-EGF. The amino acid sequence of the
          heparin-binding region of HB-EGF (
          21KRKKKGKGLGKKRDPCLRKYK 41) [ 2 ] has been shown to have
          a strong affinity for heparin and may influence the
          interaction of this growth factor with cell-surface
          negatively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans [ 22 ] .
          It remains to be seen whether specific/all of the
          EGF-like modules are required and whether calcium is
          needed for the interaction of HB-EGF with LTBP-3.
          The LTBP-3 protein is secreted as a soluble protein
          from the cell surface into the extracellular matrix. Two
          of the proposed functions of LTBP proteins include
          protecting TGF-β from premature proteolytic cleavage and
          targeting TGF-β to its appropriate cell-surface receptor.
          During cellular synthesis of TGF-β, a small latent
          complex containing the latency-associated peptide and the
          mature TGF-β is synthesized. This small latent complex
          may be secreted inefficiently from the cell surface at
          relatively slow rates [ 23 ] . However, when the small
          latent complex is bound by the latent transforming growth
          factor β-binding protein via a disulfide bond to the
          latency-associated peptide, the result is the formation
          of a large latent complex which may be secreted
          efficiently and at a relatively high rate compared to the
          small latent complex [ 23 ] . Latent TGF-β is then
          released from the extracellular matrix via proteolytic
          cleavage from the large latent complex, and the resulting
          active TGF-β is now able to bind to the appropriate TGF-β
          cell-surface receptors [ 24 ] .
          It is well accepted that TGF-β is important for the
          regulation of extracellular matrix synthesis and
          degradation. The presence of TGF-β increases the
          expression of such extracellular matrix proteins as
          fibronectin, the fibronectin receptor, vitronectin,
          tenascin, elastin, thrombospondin, collagen, and biglycan
          [ 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 ] and also inhibits expression
          of proteases that degrade the extracellular matrix while
          stimulating the expression of protease inhibitors [ 33 34
          35 36 ] .
          It is interesting to note that although Bulus and
          Barnard [ 16 ] showed that TGF-β treatment of R1E cells
          resulted in increased level of HB-EGF expression, they
          did not report any direct physical interactions between
          the growth factors TGF-β and HB-EGF. It may be that
          LTBP-3 provides a physical link between soluble mHB-EGF
          and TGF-β. Possible functions for the apparent
          interaction of mHB-EGF with LTBP-3 include the targeting
          of the TGF-β within its protective large latent complex
          to its appropriate TGF-β cell-surface receptor, or the
          targeting of the TGF-β large latent complex to the EGF
          receptor via binding of mHB-EGF to the appropriate EGF
          receptor. These are reasonable functions for the role of
          the proposed mHB-EGF :LTBP-3 protein:protein interactions
          as the expression of both mHB-EGF and TGF-β is important
          during extracellular matrix formation in wound healing [
          1 25 ] ; it has been suggested that the coordinated
          activities of HB-EGF and TGF-β regulate the wound healing
          process [ 16 ] .
        
        
          The extracellular domain of proHB-EGF interacts
          with monkey fibulin 1C
          The extracellular domain of proHB-EGF interacts with
          monkey fibulin-1C (Additional file 1). Fibulin-1 is a
          calcium-binding extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is
          associated with various connective tissues, basement
          membranes and blood [ 37 38 39 ] . Splicing of the C
          terminal domain of fibulin-1 can lead to the expression
          of different variants of fibulin-1 (A-D) [ 37 ] . The
          amino acid sequence of the human fibulin-1C protein
          encodes five domains: a signal sequence (35 amino acid
          residues), three anaphylatoxin type I repeats (108
          residues), an adjoining sequence (33 amino acid
          residues), nine calcium-binding type II EGF-like modules
          (387 amino acid residues), and a carboxyl domain (116
          amino acid residues) [ 37 ] . The amino acid sequence
          derived from the nucleotide sequence obtained for monkey
          fibulin-1C (GenBank accession number AF395659) shows it
          to share 97.2 % identity with the amino acid sequence for
          human fibulin-1C (GenBank accession number
          NP_001987).
          The EGF-like modules found in fibulin-1 are
          instrumental in a variety of extracellular
          protein:protein interactions. Fibulin-1 has been reported
          to interact with such extracellular matrix proteins as
          fibronectin, laminin, nidogen, aggrecan and versican [ 39
          40 41 42 ] . Fibronectin is a glycoprotein found as
          multimers in insoluble form in the extracellular matrix.
          Fibronectin contains three types of homology sequences,
          I-III; type I sequences bind heparin, 
          Staphylococcus aureus, fibrin, and
          cell surfaces, type II sequences bind collagen and
          gelatin, and type III sequences bind DNA, cell surfaces,
          heparin, and fibulin-1 [ 40 43 ] . Fibulin-1 interacts
          with fibronectin through a heparin-binding region in type
          III 
          13 repeat; the binding of fibulin-1 to
          this site is independent of the binding of heparin as
          addition of exogenous heparin does not inhibit fibulin-1
          binding to fibronectin [ 40 ] . The fibronectin-binding
          site in fibulin-1 is located in EGF-like modules 5 and 6
          [ 44 ] ; the binding of fibulin-1 to fibronectin is a
          heterotypic interaction in which an EGF-like module binds
          to a non EGF-like domain (the type III 
          13 fibronectin repeat) [ 40 ] .
          Laminin is a glycoprotein composed of three chains, A,
          B1, and B2 in a cross-shaped molecule; this protein is
          found in basement membranes where it interacts with other
          such components as collagen IV, heparan-sulfate
          proteoglycan, and nidogen [ 45 ] . Laminin contains
          EGF-like modules in the amino-terminal region of the A,
          B1, and B2 chains [ 45 ] . Surprisingly, these modules do
          not appear to be involved in the binding of fibulin-1.
          The site of fibulin-1 binding to laminin maps to the
          carboxyl-terminal segment of the laminin A chain which
          consists of five basic tandem repeats containing
          conserved glycine and cysteine residues [ 39 46 ] . The
          binding site of laminin to fibulin-1 maps to the
          calcium-binding type II EGF-like modules of fibulin-1 [
          39 ] .
          Nidogen is a basement membrane protein composed of
          three globular domains G1-G3 and two linking sequences;
          domain G1 is joined to domain G2 through a flexible link
          and domain G2 is connected to domain G3 by a rod-like
          element consisting of EGF-like modules [ 47 ] . Nidogen1
          is an important structural component of tertiary
          complexes with other such extracellular components as
          laminins, collagen IV, perlecan, and fibulins [ 48 ] .
          Fibulin-1C binds to nidogen1 through domain G2 of nidogen
          [ 48 ] . The nidogen binding site of fibulin-1C includes
          the type II EGF-like modules 6-9 and the
          carboxyl-terminal domain [ 42 ] .
          Aggrecan and versican are aggregating proteoglycans
          that are key constituents found in the extracellular
          matrix [ 41 ] . Both proteoglycans contain amino-terminal
          hyaluronic acid-binding regions, central core
          glycosaminoglycan attachment domains, and
          carboxyl-terminal domains containing EGF-like modules
          (one in aggrecan and two in versican), C-type lectin like
          modules and complement regulatory protein-like modules [
          49 50 ] . Fibulin-1 exhibits calcium-dependent binding to
          the carboxyl-terminal domain of aggrecan and versican [
          41 ] . The binding site of aggrecan to fibulin-1 maps to
          the type II EGF-like modules 8-9 and the
          carboxyl-terminal domain of fibulin-1 [ 41 ] . The
          binding site of versican to fibulin-1 maps to the type II
          EGF-like modules 2-8 of fibulin-1 [ 41 ] .
          Fibulin-1 has been reported two exhibit
          calcium-dependent self-association [ 40 44 ] . The two
          self-association sites map to type II EGF-like modules 5
          and 6 and to a cryptic site in the amino-terminal region
          of fibulin-1 [ 40 44 ] .
          As described above, the calcium-binding type II
          EGF-like modules of fibulin-1 are used in various
          extracellular matrix interactions. It is noteworthy that
          these modules may interact with other EGF-like modules or
          with non EGF-like modules.
          The yeast two-hybrid system and colony hybridization
          screens used in this study indicated that a monkey cDNA
          clone (Fig. 3), containing half of the anaphylatoxin type
          I repeats, an EGF-adjoining sequence, calcium-binding
          EGF-like modules and a carboxyl-terminal fibulin-type
          module, demonstrated interaction with the extracellular
          domain of proHB-EGF (Additional file 1). To see if the
          any/all of the calcium-binding EGF-like modules were
          necessary for this interaction, two clones were
          constructed. A clone, pGAD424/Fib-1C EGF #5-COOH, that
          contained calcium-binding type EGF-like modules #5-9 and
          the carboxyl-terminus of fibulin-1C fused to the
          GAL4-activation domain (see Fig. 3and materials and
          methods) was tested using the yeast two-hybrid system and
          found to interact with the extracellular domain of
          proHB-EGF (Table 1). In constrast, the construct,
          pGAD424/Fib-1C EGF#1-5, that contained calcium-binding
          type II EGF-like modules #1-5 fused to the GAL4
          activation domain (see Fig. 3and materials and methods)
          did not interact with proHB-EGF (Additional file 1). It
          remains to be determined which of the regions within the
          EGF-like modules #5-9 (e.g. hydroxylation and
          glycosylation sites) and the carboxyl-terminus of
          fibulin-1C are necessary for the interaction with
          proHB-EGF. The interaction of fibulin-1C may map to the
          heparin-binding region of the extracellular domain of
          proHB-EGF or it may map to the EGF-like module of
          proHB-EGF or it may map to both of these regions within
          proHB-EGF. To test whether the fibulin-1C interaction
          with proHB-EGF maps to the heparin-binding region, a
          construct, pGBT9/prodelHB-EGF, containing amino acid
          residues Asp 106-His 159(the entire EGF like region of
          proHB-EGF and 18 out of 32 residues of the
          heparin-binding region) [ 2 ] was used in the yeast
          two-hybrid system (see materials and methods). Construct
          pGBT9/prodelHB-EGF was unable to interact with
          pGAD424/Fib-1C EGF#5-COOH (data not shown). Caution must
          be used with this result however, as the size of the
          cloned prodelHB-EGF region is small, encoding just 54
          amino acids; this may have resulted in a Gal4 fusion
          protein in which the EGF epitopes in prodelHB-EGF are
          hidden by the Gal4 subunit and thus not recognized by the
          GAL4 fusion partner protein (GAL4/Fib-lC EGF
          #5-COOH).

          Fibulin-1 is incorporated into fibronectin-containing
          matrix fibers [ 44 51 ] . Although a distinct function
          for fibulin-1 has not yet been described, it is
          conceivable that fibulin-1 is important for cell adhesion
          and migration along protein fibers within the
          extracellular matrix. Fibulin-1 may serve to anchor the
          mHB-EGF to its fibers as it migrates through the
          extracellular matrix. As explained above, mHB-EGF has
          been reported to be involved as a structural protein in
          such tissue developmental processes as wound healing and
          it is feasible that the direct physical association of
          mHB-EGF with fibulin-1 may be useful in the tissue
          remodeling of a wound site and in scar formation.
          The results presented in this paper now suggest that
          there is potential in carrying out experiments to further
          delineate the molecular interactions between proHB-EGF
          and LTBP-3 and between proHB-EGF and fibulin-1C. A
          transitional step in this process will be the expression
          and purification of these proteins. In order to rule out
          false positives that may have resulted from the yeast
          two-hybrid system, experiments that provide
          co-immunoprecipitation data or solid phase binding
          results of the interaction of these proteins will be
          useful.
          The interaction of EGF-modules with either non
          EGF-like modules (e.g. the EGF-like modules of fibulin-1C
          interacting with the heparin-binding region of
          fibronectin) or with EGF-like modules (e.g. the
          interaction of fibulin-1C with aggrecan and versican)
          between extracellular matrix proteins argues for the
          interaction of the EGF-modules containing within
          fibulin-1C and LTBP-3 with either the heparin-binding
          region or with the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, we have shown the interaction of two novel
        proteins with the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF using a
        yeast two-hybrid system. The interactions of LTBP-3 and
        fibulin-1C with the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF may
        provide further insights into the roles that these proteins
        play in cellular and tissue development processes. The
        trafficking of such growth factors as HB-EGF and TGF-β and
        structural proteins within the extracellular matrix is
        important in wound healing processes. Therefore, the
        interactions of HB-EGF with LTBP-3 and fibulin-1C described
        in this study suggest novel functions for HB-EGF between
        cell-surfaces and tissue surfaces.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        The plasmid vectors, pGBT9, pGAD424, pTD1, pVA3, the
        monkey cv-1 cDNA library in pGAD10, and the 
        S. cerevisiae strains Y187 and Y190
        were obtained from Clontech. The cv-1 cDNA library was
        amplified and stored as per the manufacturer's
        instructions. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals and
        reagents were obtained from Sigma.
        
        E. coli strain DH5α was used as the
        host strain for cloning. The extracellular domain (amino
        acid residues Glu 24-His 159) of monkey proHB-EGF (GenBank
        accession number Q09118) [ 2 ] was amplified by PCR using
        primers MkHB-EGF 
        ex (5') TCGGCACTGGTGGAATTCGAGAGCCTGGAG
        and MKHB-EGF 
        ex (3') CACAGCCAGGATGGATCCATGGTCATAGGT.
        The PCR product was digested with 
        Eco RI and 
        Bam HI and ligated into the 
        Eco RI and 
        Bam HI restriction sites of pGBT9 and
        pGAD424 to produce constructs pGBT9/proHB-EGFEx and
        pGAD424/proHB-EGFEx, respectively. The pGBT9/proHB-EGFEx
        construct was used as the bait construct in the yeast
        two-hybrid screen to identify extracellular proteins that
        interact with the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF. The
        EGF-like region (amino acid residues Asp 106-His 159) of
        monkey proHB-EGF [ 2 ] was amplified by PCR using primers
        MkHB-EGF 5'CTAGGGAAGGAATTCGACCCATGTCTTCGG and MkHB-EGF
        3'CACAGCCAGGATGGATCCTCAATGGTCATAGG. The PCR product was
        digested with 
        Eco RI and 
        Bam HI and ligated into the 
        Eco RI and 
        Bam HI restriction sites of pGBT9 to
        produce construct pGBT9/prodelHB-EGF.
        All plasmid constructs were transformed into the 
        S. cerevisiae strains, Y187 and Y190,
        using the lithium acetate protocol as per the
        manufacturer's instructions. Y190 transformants containing
        pGBT9/proHB-EGFEx and pGAD10/cv-1 library were plated onto
        Trp -Leu -His -agar plates. The triple auxotrophic
        transformants were tested for β-galactosidase activity
        using the filter paper assay described in the manual
        provided by Clontech. A positive control of Y187 or Y190
        containing both plasmids pTD1 and pVA3 together was
        included in every β-galactosidase assay. A negative control
        of Y187 or Y190 containing both plasmid vectors, pGBT9 and
        pGAD424, was included in all β-galactosidase assays.
        Each construct from the cDNA library that tested
        positive for both 
        lacZ and 
        his reporter gene expression was also
        tested for the ability to activate directly
        β-galactosidase/ 
        his reporter gene transcription
        without the presence of the bait construct,
        pGBT9/proHB-EGFEx. False positives were eliminated using
        this screening assay. Potential true positive clones were
        sequenced using primers GAD10SEQ 5'TACCACTACAATGGATG and
        GAD10cSEQ 5'GTTGAAGTGAACTTGCGGGG with the automated DNA
        sequencing facilities available at our Institution.
        Comparisons of the obtained sequences were made using the
        GENBANK database. The sequences for monkey LTBP-3 and
        monkey fibulin-1c have been submitted to the GenBank
        database under the accession numbers AF395658 and AF395659
        respectively. Sequence alignment and identity was
        determined using the Mac Vector sequence analysis
        program.
        The calcium-binding type II EGF-like modules #1-8 of
        monkey LTBP-3 (Fig. 1) were amplified by PCR using primers
        GAD10SEQ 5'TACCACTACAATGGATG and LB3priLQGSYVC
        5'CGCGGATCCTCAACACACATAGGAGCCCTGAAG. The PCR product was
        digested with 
        Eco RI and 
        Bam HI and ligated into the 
        Eco RI and 
        Bam HI restriction sites of pGADA424
        to produce construct pGAD424/LTBP-3 EGF#1-8. The construct
        was sequenced as described above using the primers
        pGAD10SEQ and pGAD10cSEQ.
        The calcium-binding type II EGF-like modules #1-5 (Fig.
        3) of monkey fibulin-1C were amplified by PCR using primers
        Fib5priYLNDRC 5'CGAATTCTATCTGAATGACCGCTGC and Fib3priCAPPAE
        5'CCGTCGACTCACTCAGCAGGTGGCGCGCA. The calcium-binding type
        II EGF-like repeats #5-9 (Fig. 3) and the carboxyl terminus
        of monkey fibulin-1C were amplified by PCR using primers
        Fib5priCAPPAE 5'CGAATTCTGCGCGCCACCTGCTGA and Fib3priFVSAEL
        5'CCGTCGACTCAGAGCTCTGCAGACACAAA. The PCR products were
        digested with 
        Eco RI and 
        Sal I and ligated into the 
        Eco RI and 
        Sal I restriction sites of pGAD424 to
        produce constructs pGAD424/Fib-1C EGF#1-5 and
        pGAD424/Fib-1C EGF#5-COOH respectively. The constructs were
        sequenced as described above using primers pGAD10SEQ and
        pGAD10cSEQ.
        A random primed P 33labeled 1.8 kb DNA probe to the
        region of LTBP-3 gene containing domain 4 was prepared
        using the High Prime Labeling Kit from Roche Molecular
        Biochemicals. Colony hybridizations were performed on 
        E. coli colonies containing the
        monkey cv-1 cDNA library. Colony lifts on zeta probe
        membranes (Bio-Rad) were performed and the colonies were
        denatured and neutralized as described by Sambrook et al. [
        52 ] air dried and then UV cross-linked using a Stratagene
        crosslinker. The probe was allowed to hybridize to the
        colony DNA at 42°C overnight as described by Sambrook et
        al. [ 52 ] . The membranes were then rinsed and washed
        twice for 5 minutes in 2X SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature,
        twice for 15 minutes in 0.1X SSC/0.1 % SDS at 68°C, and
        once for 15 minutes in 0.1X SSC/0.1% SDS at room
        temperature. The colony blots were then wrapped in saran
        wrap and exposed to X-ray film at room temperature for 24 h
        at -80°C. The above strategy was used to perform colony
        blot hybridization screening on the monkey cv-1 cDNA
        library using a ~750 bp P 33-labeled probe to a region of
        the fibulin-1C gene containing most of the type I
        anaphylatoxin repeats and almost all of the type II
        EGF-like repeats (Fig. 3).
