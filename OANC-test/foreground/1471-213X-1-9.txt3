        Circadian rhythms, synchronized to external
        environmental cycles such as day and night, occur in a
        broad range of physiological and behavioral processes.
        Endogenous oscillators or clocks capable of sustained
        oscillation through multiple cycles control such rhythms in
        the absence of external cues [ 1, 2]. Molecular-genetic
        analysis of circadian rhythms in 
        Drosophila, Neurospora and more
        recently in vertebrate systems has led to the conclusion [
        3, 4, 5] that rhythms of gene expression are of central
        importance both in the sustained generation of rhythmicity
        (clock genes) and in the control of output pathways (clock
        controlled genes).
        Recently, the search for components of the vertebrate
        circadian system has led to the identification of
        homologues of 
        period [ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and 
        timeless [ 13, 14, 15, 16],
        originally characterized as central clock genes in 
        Drosophila , as well as 
        Clock and 
        Bmal1 ( 
        Cycle ), identified initially in the
        mouse [ 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. In 
        Drosophila CLOCK and BMAL1 regulate
        transcription of 
        period ( 
        per ) and 
        timeless ( 
        tim ) in a cycle in which the PER and
        TIM proteins dimerize, enter the nucleus, and negatively
        regulate their own transcription [ 22, 23]. This pattern of
        rhythmic gene transcription appears to be of central
        importance to the clock mechanism. In addition, rhythmic
        regulation of the transcription of "clock controlled" genes
        such as tryptophan hydroxylase is important in the
        regulation of overt rhythms downstream of the clock [ 24,
        25].
        Among vertebrates, circadian oscillators have been
        formally identified in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the
        mammalian brain [ 26], the retina [ 27, 28, 29], and the
        pineal gland of non-mammalian vertebrates [ 30, 31]. Each
        of these systems controls behavioral, physiological or
        neuroendocrine rhythms that are of physiological importance
        to the organism. However, it has recently become apparent
        that rhythmic gene expression occurs more broadly. For
        example, in 
        Drosophila the circadian oscillator
        controlling behavioral rhythmicity can be localized to a
        small set of lateral neurons in the brain [ 32] while
        circadian transcription of the clock gene, 
        period , occurs in multiple tissues
        and organs even when isolated to an 
        in vitro setting [ 33]. The recent
        identification of period gene homologues in mammals has led
        to a similar finding of rhythmic expression in multiple
        tissues [ 7, 8, 10, 11, 12]. In one case, sustained
        rhythmicity has been demonstrated in tissue culture [
        34].
        The 
        nocturnin gene was discovered in a
        differential display screen for circadian gene expression
        using the retina of the African clawed frog, 
        Xenopus laevis [ 35, 36]. The gene
        encodes a protein with a leucine repeat domain and a domain
        homologous to the carbon catabolite repression 4 protein
        (CCR4), a transcription co-activator in yeast [ 37].
        Analysis of the EST database also revealed human
        transcripts with extensive sequence similarity to the same
        domain in yeast CCR4 and NOCTURNIN [ 36]. CCR4 is thought
        to affect gene transcription through interactions with
        other proteins in the yeast transcriptional apparatus [
        37]. In 
        Xenopus retina, 
        nocturnin was found to exhibit high
        amplitude rhythmicity in which most, if not all, of the
        nighttime increase in mRNA could be accounted for as
        increased gene transcription [ 36].
        Although the 
        nocturnin gene appears to encode a
        potentially important component of the circadian regulatory
        system in the 
        Xenopus eye, its position within or
        downstream of the circadian clock mechanism has not been
        determined. In addition, its importance in mammalian
        circadian regulation and in systems outside of the eye has
        not been evaluated. Here we report that a mouse homologue
        of nocturnin is expressed in a circadian pattern in
        multiple tissues including retina, spleen, kidney, heart
        and liver. Widespread rhythmic expression of mouse 
        nocturnin ( 
        mNoc ) parallels the pattern seen for
        other clock-related genes in the mouse, indicating that
        nocturnin is broadly associated with other circadian
        regulatory components.
      
      
        Results
        
          Homologues of Xenopus Nocturnin
          Blast analysis of public databases reveals a large
          number of coding sequences with significant similarity to
          
          Xenopus nocturnin ( 
          xNoc ). As we originally reported [
          36], XNOC protein is similar to a large, C-terminal
          domain of the transcriptional regulator, CCR4, but
          appears to be lacking in several regulatory domains
          critical to CCR4 function. Recently, however, mouse and
          human cDNAs encoding homologues (Fig. 1A) of the same
          domain of CCR4, but comparable in size to XNOC [ 38, 39]
          have been reported (Accession number # AAD56547 and
          AAD56548). Furthermore, availability of the complete
          genome of 
          Drosophila melanogaster [ 40] has
          revealed a coding sequence (AAF54601.1) with significant
          similarity to XNOC. In addition to these, we have
          recently added a complete coding sequence of mouse
          nocturnin cDNA from retina ( 
          mNoc ) along with partial coding
          sequences for human ( 
          hNoc ), bovine ( 
          bNoc ), rat ( 
          rNoc ) and chicken ( 
          cNoc ).
          Among the sequences illustrated in Figure 1, NOCTURNIN
          shows a high level of conservation throughout its coding
          sequence. As aligned, xNoc is 66% and 65% identical to
          HNOC and MNOC respectively. The aa identity drops to 36%
          when compared to DNOC. Among the vertebrate species this
          conservation is particularly striking beginning at aa 67.
          This methionine (not aligned in the 
          Drosophila sequence) corresponds to
          the fourth codon of 
          Xenopus [ 36] and mouse exon II [
          39]; the ATG at this site meets the Kozak [ 41] consensus
          for translation initiation in all three species and
          represents a possible alternative site of translation
          initiation. In the region beginning at the start of exon
          II XNOC is 78% identical to HNOC. The short coding
          sequence of XNOC exon I (22 aa) aligns poorly with a
          longer amino terminal region in the other species. In
          addition to the high sequence similarity, 
          Xenopus [ 36] and mouse [ 39] genes
          have a simple 3 exon structure with very similar
          boundaries of the second and third exons.
          Previously, an unusual leucine zipper-like domain was
          identified in 
          Xenopus nocturnin [ 36]. The third
          leucine in the 
          Xenopus sequence is either a
          tyrosine (mouse and rat) or a phenylalanine (human, cow
          and chicken) in other vertebrates (see bar in Fig. 1).
          Furthermore, the alanine in position 4 of the second
          heptad is replaced by a proline in all five species. The
          latter proline is adjacent to a conserved proline
          identified earlier in XNOC (Fig. 1). These proline
          residues are not compatible with the coiled-coil
          structure charateristic of leucine zipper motifs [ 42].
          However, conservation of this region of the protein
          suggests that it is functionally important, perhaps
          serving as a protein interaction domain as is the case
          for a leucine rich-region in CCR4 [ 32, 37, 43]
        
        
          mNocis Expressed in Multiple Tissues of the
          Mouse
          The principal goal of this study was to analyze 
          mNoc mRNA expression. We used
          C3H/He mice because they are useful for studying clock
          activity based on rhythmic release of melatonin; C3H/He
          is one of the few mouse strains that synthesizes
          melatonin rhythmically [ 29, 44]. In Northern analysis
          using single stranded probes generated from the 
          mNoc 3' UTR or from exon II, we
          found that in contrast to our prior work in 
          Xenopus, mNoc is expressed as a
          single mRNA of about 3 kb (Fig. 2). The only variations
          from this pattern was diffuse hybridization of the probe
          above the 3 kb position when gels contained higher levels
          of 
          mNoc mRNA (Fig. 2, liver and
          kidney; Fig. 3, 4and 5at ZT 12) and diffuse hybridization
          below the 3 kb band specifically in spleen (Figs. 2, 5C);
          the latter may reflect RNA degradation.
          
          mNoc is expressed (Fig. 2) in
          retina, brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, ovary,
          skeletal muscle (data not shown), pineal gland (data not
          shown), testis and thymus. It appears to be expressed at
          the highest levels in liver, then testis, kidney and
          retina. Lung has the lowest expression level of those
          tested. In addition, 
          mNoc mRNA is expressed at early
          embryonic stages (Fig. 2).
        
        
          mNoc is Rhythmically Expressed in Multiple
          Tissues
          Northern analysis of retinal RNA shows that, as was
          the case in 
          Xenopus, mNoc exhibits a rhythm of
          mRNA abundance. Peak expression occurs at the time of
          light offset (Fig. 3A). However, the amplitude of the
          rhythm is approximately 2 fold compared to the greater
          than 10 fold amplitude seen in 
          Xenopus retina. Rhythmicity with a
          similar peak at ZT12 is also seen in heart (Fig. 3B),
          spleen (Fig. 3C), kidney (Fig. 3D), and liver (Fig. 4).
          The amplitudes of the rhythms in heart, spleen and
          kidney, as determined by phosphor imaging, reflect 2 to 5
          fold changes between minimum and maximum. In contrast,
          the magnitude of the day-night difference in liver
          represents a nearly 30 fold change (see Fig. 4). Although
          the overall pattern of rhythmicity is similar in these
          tissues, baseline expression during the day is evident in
          retina, heart, and spleen and in part accounts for the
          lower amplitude in these tissues.
        
        
          Rhythms of mNocmRNA Abundance are Circadian in
          Nature
          In order to investigate the endogenous rhythmicity of 
          mNoc expression, C3H/He mice were
          maintained in constant darkness for 36 hours before
          sampling for rhythmic changes in DD. Samples were then
          taken in darkness at 6 time points referenced to the
          normal LD cycle in which they had been maintained
          (referred to as Zeitgeber Time). 
          mNoc from all five tissues shows
          rhythmic changes in mRNA abundance (Figs. 4and 5).
          Furthermore, liver tissue exhibits a high amplitude
          rhythm with virtually no mRNA detectable in the day-time
          as was the case in LD (Fig. 4B). The other four tissues
          all exhibit a higher level of daytime expression than in
          LD (Fig. 5). Unlike other tissues, spleen RNA exhibits a
          diffuse zone of hybridization centered at 1.0-1.2 kb,
          which may reflect RNA degradation.
          
          mNoc mRNA appeared to reach higher
          levels at ZT12 in DD than LD in all tissues except retina
          (compare Figs 3, 4, 5), suggesting that light may
          suppress 
          mNoc mRNA level. This was
          particularly striking in liver where the ratio of
          mNoc/β-actin as determined by phosphorimaging was greater
          at ZT12 in DD than in LD (see Fig. 4D). This difference
          appears to be significant in that it was reproducible in
          an independent replication of the experiment in which LD
          and DD samples were analyzed on the same blot.
        
        
          C3H/He and 129SV Mice Lack a Transposable IAP
          Element in the NocturninGene
          Laboratory strains of mice are heterogeneous in the
          presence of a transposable intracisternal A-particle
          (IAP) element in the 
          nocturnin/CCR4 gene. During the
          course of our work on the mNoc cDNA it was reported [ 38,
          39] that a transposable IAP of viral origin, present in
          about 1000 copies throughout the mouse genome, is found
          in the first intron of the 
          mNoc/CCR4 gene. In DBA/2, BALB/c,
          C57Bl/6 and C57Bl/10 mice, transcriptional read through
          from the IAP insert to the 
          mNoc/CCR4 open reading frame
          resulted in hybrid transcripts (3, 6 and 10 kb) whose
          abundance increased in aging mice. Apparently, insertion
          of the IAP element in the first intron occurred
          relatively recently because the insert was found to be
          lacking in some strains of mice [ 39]. We confirmed the
          lack of an IAP element in 129/SV and C3H/He (the strain
          used in the rhythmic analysis above) mice through a
          combination of genomic PCR and partial sequencing of a
          genomic clone. As shown in Figure 6, genomic PCR using
          primers from sites in the intron adjacent to the IAP
          position revealed only intronic sequence in C3H/He and
          129/SV mice. This was further confirmed for 129/SV mice
          by the lack of an IAP element in genomic sequence from
          this region as well (data not shown). Although the IAP
          element is absent in these two strains of mice, we
          confirmed the presence of the IAP sequence by PCR in
          BALB/c (Fig. 6B) and C57/Bl6 (data not shown) mice as
          reported [ 39].
        
        
          Rhythmic Expression of mNocin BALB/c Mice
          We tested the hypothesis that the IAP element in
          Intron I of BALB/c mice ([ 14, 36] see Fig. 6) would
          disrupt rhythmic expression of 
          mNoc . Six week old BALB/c mice
          were kept in our animal facilities for two weeks and
          liver and kidney tissues were obtained for Northern
          analysis at 6 hour intervals through a light-dark cycle.
          As shown in Figure 7, mNoc in BALB/c mouse liver and
          kidney clearly exhibits rhythmicity similar to that seen
          in C3H/He mice with a prominent mRNA band at
          approximately 3 kb. Less abundant larger bands are also
          seen above 4 kb (liver and kidney) and 8 kb (liver only).
          Although larger mRNA bands have been reported to reflect
          hybrid transcripts including components of the IAP
          element in aging BALB/c mice, it is unclear whether this
          would explain the larger bands in Figure 7. The bands in
          Figure 7are smaller than the 6 and 10 kb bands reported
          in old mice [ 38, 39] and follow a rhythmic pattern
          similar to that of the 3 kb band. The larger bands could
          reflect splicing intermediates that are seen only during
          the period of maximal transcription of 
          mNoc . Although it is possible that
          altered transcription of 
          mNoc as a consequence of an
          interaction between aging and the IAP insert may alter
          the rhythmic pattern of expression [ 39], our data
          clearly indicate that the mere presence of the IAP
          element in mice 8 weeks of age has little or no impact on
          rhythmic expression. Comparable results have been
          obtained using C57/Bl6 and CBA/J mice (data not
          shown).
        
        
          Expression of mNocin the Brain
          As shown in Figure 2, 
          mNoc mRNA is expressed in tissue
          from the mid-brain, which contains the hypothalamus
          including the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In several
          attempts at temporal Northern analysis in LD using
          samples excised from the midbrain of C3H/He and C57/Bl6
          mice, we saw hints of low amplitude rhythmicity, but the
          results were variable and could have resulted from
          sampling error (data not shown). We, therefore, examined
          brain expression of 
          mNoc mRNA further using in situ
          hybridization of tissue from C57/Bl6 mice fixed at ZT 4,
          ZT 12, and ZT 20. 
          mNoc transcripts were detected
          (Fig. 8) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the
          ventral hypothalamic nucleus, arcuate nucleus (Arc), the
          piriform cortex (Pir), the hippocampus (Hip), the
          cerebellum, the subiculum, the internal granule layer of
          the olfactory bulbs and the pineal gland. Although we saw
          variability at different sample times (Table 1) in the
          intensity of the hybridization in several brain regions,
          the observations were of a qualitative nature and the
          magnitude of the changes was not great. Although the in
          situ hybridization data suggest low amplitude rhythmicity
          in these brain regions (including the SCN), we have not
          detected rhythmic expression in the brain comparable to
          the high amplitude rhythmicity detected in peripheral
          tissues.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our principal findings are that both the structure of
        the putative NOCTURNIN protein and circadian expression of
        its mRNA are conserved in the mouse. In addition, partial
        cDNA sequences and database analysis reveals 
        xNoc homologues in 
        Drosophila , human, rat, cow, and
        chicken. 
        xNoc was originally identified as the
        product of a differential display screen for circadian
        clock-regulated genes [ 35, 36] in the retina of the
        African clawed frog, a system known to exhibit circadian
        clock activity in an 
        in vitro setting [ 27, 45]. High
        amplitude circadian regulation of the 
        xNoc mRNA with peak abundance at
        night was found to be a defining feature of the gene.
        Nuclear run-on assays showed that the high amplitude
        circadian rhythm of 
        xNoc was controlled at the level of
        gene transcription. Furthermore, 
        xNoc was found to be expressed in
        photoreceptors, the site of a retinal circadian oscillator
        [ 28]. To further our understanding of 
        nocturnin , we initiated analysis of
        mammalian homologues of 
        xNoc .
        The main features of the putative NOCTURNIN protein in 
        Xenopus were a leucine repeat domain
        and a CCR4 homology domain [ 36]; both regions are evident
        in the other sequences. However, the unusual leucine-repeat
        domain, originally identified in XNOC, is not well
        conserved and exhibits significant deviations from the
        classic leucine zipper model [ 42]. The principal changes
        are the substitution of either tyrosine or phenylalanine
        for leucine at the beginning of the third heptad repeat and
        the addition of a second proline adjacent to the first in
        the second heptad repeat. Both changes, although conserved
        in five different species, are deviations from the
        classical leucine zipper model. Proline residues, as
        pointed out previously [ 36] are expected to disrupt the
        coiled-coil structure of the protein. The conservation of
        this domain, including the prolines, suggests that it is a
        functionally important motif. Although its function is
        unknown, one possibility is that it serves as a protein
        interaction domain. For example, the leucine-rich domain in
        CCR4, mediates interaction with other proteins of the basal
        transcription apparatus [ 43].
        The other conserved structural feature of nocturnin is a
        domain with homology to the C-terminus of yeast CCR4, a
        factor required for the transcription of genes including
        ADH2 (the glucose repressible alcohol dehydrogenase II; [
        43]). CCR4 is a multi-domain protein, substantially larger
        than nocturnin [ 37, 43]; its estimated molecular weight is
        94.5 kDa compared to 43.9 kDa for XNOC. CCR4 is thought to
        interact with other proteins via a leucine rich domain in
        the middle of the molecule. It is of some interest that
        while XNOC, MNOC and HNOC all align with the C-terminal
        domain, alignment of the leucine zipper-like domain of XNOC
        with the leucine rich region of CCR4 is relatively poor.
        Furthermore, regulatory domains, such as the glucose
        repressed activation domain and glucose independent
        activation domain, found in the amino-terminal half of CCR4
        [ 37] are not present in NOCTURNIN. The fact that CCR4 has
        been characterized as a transcriptional co-activator has
        led to the speculation that nocturnin serves a similar
        function. However, the lack of key activation domains in
        nocturnin that are required for the function of CCR4
        suggests that yeast CCR4 may not be the best model for
        delineating NOCTURNIN function. We believe that one of the
        keys to understanding NOCTURNIN function is to identify its
        putative binding partners.
        xNoc was identified on the basis of its high amplitude
        circadian expression in the 
        Xenopus retina [ 36]. However, in
        several additional 
        Xenopus tissues we were unable to
        detect 
        xNoc mRNA by Northern analysis. A
        major finding of this study is that 
        mNoc mRNA is detected in most, if not
        all, tissues of the adult mouse. Furthermore,
        identification of ESTs derived from mouse and human
        embryonic cDNA libraries along with our Northern data on
        mouse embryo RNA indicate that mNoc is expressed early in
        development. Recently, early and ubiquitous expression of 
        xNoc has also been detected during 
        Xenopus embryogenesis (Green,
        unpublished). Furthermore, rhythmic increases of mRNA
        abundance that persists in constant darkness, have been
        seen in mouse retina, liver, kidney, heart and spleen. This
        provides evidence that the rhythmic changes in 
        mNoc mRNA are controlled by one or
        more circadian oscillators. Although this study has
        emphasized retinal and non-neural tissues, Northern
        analysis has revealed 
        mNoc mRNA in brain and pineal tissue.
        In addition, we have found (see below) that nocturnin is
        expressed in multiple brain regions including the
        suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the site of the central
        circadian oscillator controlling behavioral rhythmicity [
        26].
        The widespread circadian expression of 
        mNoc mRNA in multiple tissues of the
        mouse parallels that of the 
        Drosophila central "clock gene", 
        period , which was recently
        characterized in mammals. The 
        period gene is rhythmically expressed
        in multiple tissues as well as in the central "clock"
        controlling behavior in both 
        Drosophila [ 33] and mouse [ 7, 8,
        10, 11, 12]. At present we do not know if 
        nocturnin plays a role as a central
        component of the circadian clock mechanism or as a "clock
        controlled" gene, perhaps coupling clock activity to an
        unidentified physiological rhythm. However, widespread
        expression and rhythmic regulation of 
        mNoc argues against a limited role in
        rhythmic physiology of the retina or in the regulation of
        its melatonin output rhythm suggested by the earlier work
        on the 
        Xenopus eye. It seems more likely
        that 
        nocturnin is coupled to circadian
        function in a general way as either a central clock
        component or as a downstream effector.
        During the course of our work on 
        mNoc , it was reported [ 38, 39] that
        a transposable intracisternal A-particle (IAP) element of
        viral origin is found in the first intron of the mouse 
        nocturnin/CCR4 gene. Furthermore, it
        was reported that in DBA/2, BALB/c, C57Bl/6 and C57Bl/10
        mice, transcriptional read through from the IAP
        transcriptional start site to the 
        nocturnin/CCR4 open reading frame
        resulted in hybrid mRNA transcripts whose abundance
        increased in parallel in aging mice. This report raised the
        immediate concern that disrupted 
        mNoc transcription might modify its
        rhythmic expression pattern and function. However,
        insertion of the transposable IAP in the 
        nocturnin/CCR4 gene was apparently a
        recent event, occurring after the origin of modern mouse
        strains because some mouse strains lack the insert [ 39].
        Our genomic sequencing and PCR experiments confirm this
        finding by demonstrating that the IAP element is present in
        Balb/c and C57/Bl6 mice but lacking in 129/SV and C3H/He
        mice. Thus, the rhythmic expression of 
        mNoc as a single mRNA species in
        C3H/He mice appears to reflect the wildtype condition for
        this gene.
        The IAP insert appears to strongly affect the expression
        of 
        mNoc mRNA in aging mice. The multiple
        hybrid forms of 
        mNoc mRNA [ 38] along with the recent
        report of an absence of rhythmic expression [ 39] of 
        mNoc mRNA in mice containing the IAP
        element have raised the possibility that differences among
        mouse strains could provide a basis for understanding 
        nocturnin function. It is well known
        that strains of inbred mice have different rhythmic
        phenotypes. Perhaps the best understood is the lack of the
        ability to produce melatonin in some strains such as BALB/c
        and C57Bl/6 and the production of normal rhythms of
        melatonin in others such as the C3H/He and CBA [ 44, 46,
        47, 48, 49]. Recently, we initiated studies directed at
        analysis of 
        mNoc expression in BALB/c mice with
        the goal of determining if the IAP insertion has a direct
        consequence on rhythmic 
        mNoc expression. Our analysis shows
        that the presence of the IAP element has no impact on 
        mNoc expression or its rhythmicity in
        mice up to 8 weeks of age. Although it is possible that
        altered expression of the 
        mNoc gene during the process of aging
        may affect the rhythmic phenotype, our data indicate that
        the IAP insert itself cannot be regarded as a specific
        insertional mutation with direct consequences on
        rhythmicity.
        Although 
        nocturnin was originally identified
        as a rhythmic gene product in photoreceptors, the most
        striking rhythmicity identified in the mouse is in the
        peripheral tissues such as liver and kidney. In parallel
        with the findings of this study we recently identified 
        nocturnin as a rhythmic gene product
        in rat liver and kidney based gene array analysis of over
        9000 rat Unigenes (Kita, et al., unpublished).
        Interestingly, in the latter study rNoc was identified
        among a group of clock-regulated genes that included 
        Per1 , 
        Per2 , 
        Per3 , 
        Bmal1 , and D-binding protein ( 
        DBP ). Independent clock driven
        pathways may be critical in the function of many tissues
        and organs as suggested by the widespread expression of
        clock genes in peripheral tissues [ 7, 8, 10, 11, 12].
        Support for this conclusion comes from the recent finding
        that circadian oscillation of gene expression in the liver
        is entrained by food intake independently of the central
        oscillator in the brain [ 50]. An understanding of the
        rhythmic function of nocturnin may come from analysis of
        its role in rhythmic physiology of the liver and
        kidney.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Animals and tissue collection
          C3H/He mice, wild type (+/+) at the rd locus, were
          originally obtained from Dr. Michael Menaker at
          University of Virginia and then maintained as a breeding
          colony in ventilated environmental compartments within a
          temperature-controlled animal facility (24 -25°C) on a 12
          hour light:12 hour dark cycle (LD), except as noted.
          BALB/c, CBA/J and C57/Bl6 mice were purchased from
          Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) or Jackson
          Laboratories and maintained under similar conditions.
          Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional
          Animal Care and Use Committee and follow all federal
          guidelines. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation
          following exposure to carbon dioxide or an overdose
          halothane anesthesia. Tissues for RNA extraction in LD
          were collected at ZT0, ZT6, ZT12 and ZT18 in light
          (standard room fluorescent light) or dim red light (Kodak
          Wratten #2, filters). Those for constant dark (DD)
          experiments were collected in dim red light at ZT0, ZT4,
          ZT8, ZT12, ZT16 and ZT20 referenced to the LD cycle
          immediately before DD treatment. Bovine, chicken, rat
          (Sprague Dawley obtained from the ARC) and human retinal
          tissue (obtained from the Eye Research Institute at
          Medical College of Wisconsin) were immediately frozen on
          dry ice after dissection and stored at -80°C.
        
        
          Total RNA and Genomic DNA isolation
          Total RNA was extracted by the TRIZOL reagent protocol
          (GIBCO/BRL, Rockville, MD), and then dissolved in
          DEPC-treated water before storage at -80°C. QIAamp Tissue
          Kits (Qiagen Inc., Santa Claita, CA,) were used for
          genomic DNA extraction from liver tissues according to
          the kit protocol.
        
        
          cDNA Library Screening and DNA Sequencing
          Mouse 
          nocturnin cDNA ( 
          mNoc ) clones were obtained by
          screening a mouse BALB/c retinal cDNA library from ATCC
          (ATCC# 77448, Rockville, MD; reference [ 51]) using the
          standard protocol published in Sambrook, et al, 1989 [
          52] with probes from a human EST (T87026) purchased from
          Research Genetics, Incorporated (Huntsville, AL). 
          mNoc clones were custom sequenced
          by Sequetech Corporation (Mountain View, CA). The human
          EST (T87026) and additional human clones obtained by PCR
          were sequenced manually using T7 Sequenase 2.0 DNA
          sequencing kit (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) or using a
          BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit on an ABI Prism
          310 capillary sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster
          City, CA). MacVector software was used for sequence
          analysis in this study.
        
        
          Genomic Library Screening and Analysis
          
          mNoc bacterial artifical chromosome
          (BAC) clones were obtained from Research Genetics,
          Incorporated (Huntsville, AL) by custom screening of a
          129/SV BAC library with the "whole cell PCR" protocol.
          BAC DNA was isolated by a Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit and
          sequenced using the ABI Prism 310. For the genomic PCR in
          Figure 6the forward primer F1 (5'-AGTGACTGTCCTTCCTCTGT-3)
          is located upstream (5') and the reverse primer, R1
          (5'-AACACAGTGAGACGCTGTCT-3') is located downstream (3')
          of an intracisternal A-particle (IAP) element (reference
          [ 39]) identified in the nocturnin/CCR4 gene. The forward
          primer F2 (5'-TGATGTCCAGGGCGTCAATA-3') is located in the
          IAP element itself [ 39]. The sequences for F1 and R1 are
          based on sequences from the BAC clone characterized in
          Figure 6Awhile the sequence of F2 is from the IAP element
          (reference [ 39]). These three primers were used for
          genomic PCR with Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). All of the
          resulting PCR products were cloned into pCRII-TOPO
          (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced as above.
        
        
          Probe Preparation and Labeling
          Single strand PCR probes for Northern hybridization
          representing 553 bp of 3' UTR or Exon II of 
          mNoc were generated using a
          modification of the single-strand DNA protocol of
          Bednarczuk, et al. [ 53], including 32P-dCTP (40 mCi/ml;
          NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) in the reaction
          mixture. The primers for the 3'UTR probe were
          5'-AACCATGCAGGTACAGTC-3' (bp 1557-1575 of the 
          mNoc cDNA, forward) and
          5'-GTTTGGAAGAGGCTTCAAC-3' (bp 2128-2147, reverse); for
          the Exon II probe they were 5'-ACCAGTCGACTCTACAGTGC-3'
          (bp 355-374, forward) and 5'-GGCTGGAAGGTGTCAAAG-3'
          (bp741-759, reverse). Random primed probes were prepared
          using the Random Primers DNA Labeling Kit (GIBCO/BRL,
          Rockville, MD). Radioactive probes were purified through
          NucTrap gel filtration columns (Stratagene, La Jolla,
          CA).
        
        
          Northern Blot Analysis
          Ten μg (or less as specified) of each RNA sample was
          separated on 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gels using
          standard procedures [ 35]. Northern blot analysis was
          carried out according to QuikHyb hybridization solution
          protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Nylon membranes were
          stripped by washing twice for 10 min in boiling 0.01X
          SSPE (0.18 M NaCl/10 mM phosphate, pH 7.4/1 mM EDTA, 0.5%
          SDS) and rehybridized with probes made from mouse β-actin
          cDNA [ 54]. Hybridization signals were quantitated using
          a Storm PhosporImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular
          Dynamics) using a previously described method [ 36].
        
        
          5' RACE and PCR reactions
          Total RNA used as a template in 5'-RACE and RT-PCR was
          treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI)
          and subsequently phenol-chloroform extracted. RNasin
          Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega) was used in both 5'-RACE
          and RT-PCR reactions. 5'-RACE was performed according to
          kit protocol (GIBCO/BRL, Rockville, MD). The reverse
          Transcription System (Promega) coupled with Taq DNA
          Polymerase (Promega) was used for RT-PCR.
          Degenerative PCR was carried out using Taq DNA
          Polymerase (Promega) with
          5'-GATGGGAAAC(A/G)GCACCAG(C/T)(A/C)GAC-3' and
          5'-GC(G/C)AG(A/G)ATGTTCCACTGCAT(G/C)AC-3' as forward and
          reverse primers respectively. The resulting PCR products
          were cloned into pCRII-TOPO and sequenced with an ABI
          Prism 310 sequencer.
        
        
          Brain In Situ Hybridization
          C57/Bl6 mice were decapitated following an overdose of
          halothane anesthesia. The brain was removed, frozen on
          dry ice and stored at -80° until sectioning. In situ
          hybridization followed the protocol of Fukuhara, et al. [
          55]. {α- 35S} UTP (1250 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science
          Products, Boston, MA) labeled probes were obtained by in
          vitro transcription. A mouse 
          nocturnin cDNA fragment (450 bp)
          cloned into the pBluescript KS (+) vector (Stratagene)
          was linearized with XhoI or XbaI for antisense or sense
          probes, and radiolabeled using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase
          respectively. Serial coronal cryostat sections (20 μm
          thick) were hybridized overnight at 55°C and washed at
          57°C. Slides were exposed to Kodak Biomax film for 6 days
          at room temperature.
