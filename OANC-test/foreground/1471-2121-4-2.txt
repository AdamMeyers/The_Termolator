        The T lymphocyte actin cytoskeleton is clearly important
        in the regulation of cell activity at a variety of
        different levels. An intact actin cytoskeleton is required
        for sustained signals leading to T cell activation [ 1 ] .
        T helper and cytolytic effector cells reorient their
        intracellular components for vectorial secretion of
        cytokines [ 2 ] or cytolytic components [ 3 ] via
        cytoskeletal dependent mechanisms. Recent reports suggest
        an active role played by the T cell cytoskeleton in
        maintaining spatially defined molecular clusters found
        within the immunological synapse - a highly structured
        molecular array defined by contact regions between T cells
        and antigen presenting cells [ 4 5 6 7 ] , and reviewed in
        [ 8 9 ] or NK cells and target cells [ 10 ] . Although the
        actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in all these
        processes, perhaps its greatest role is in regulating T
        lymphocyte motility and morphology.
        The first physical step in directional motility is the
        extension of cellular processes termed pseudopods [ 11 ] .
        Pseudopodia are flattened, fan shape cellular protrusions
        enriched in signaling molecules and cytoskeletal elements
        including filamentous actin, which is preferentially
        nucleated at the leading edge of a migrating cell [ 12 ] .
        A key candidate for regulation of the T lymphocyte actin
        cytoskeleton is the GTP-binding protein Rho. This small
        member of the Ras GTPase superfamily has been implicated in
        fibroblast models of integrin dependent actin stress fiber
        formation, focal contact assembly [ 13 ] , and gene
        induction via the serum response element [ 14 ] . Studies
        of Rho function have been facilitated by the use of
        specific toxins such as 
        Clostridium botulinum toxin C3 which
        catalyses the ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of Rho [ 15
        16 17 ] . The function of this GTPase and related family
        members such as Rac and Cdc42 has been extensively studied
        in the fibroblast model. In this system it has been shown
        that Rho function is necessary for the production of actin
        stress fibers [ 13 ] . However, in cells that are
        considered highly motile and circulate through various
        compartments of the body (such as T lymphocytes), actin
        stress fibers have yet to be identified. By comparison to
        adherent cells such as fibroblasts, less work has been done
        within the formed elements of the blood, in particular,
        studies addressing the role played by Rho in the
        maintenance of T lymphocyte cytoarchitecture.
        The involvement of Rho GTPases in regulating integrin
        dependent events such as leukocyte homotypic aggregation
        and in chemokine upregulation of integrin-mediated adhesion
        has recently been identified [ 18 19 ] . ADP-ribosylation
        of Rho in neutrophils by treatment with C3 not only
        inhibits cellular locomotion, but augments chemoattractant
        induced actin polymerization [ 20 21 ] . Moreover,
        inactivation of Rho in monocytic cells leads to accelerated
        formation of filopodia, and it has been proposed that Rho
        is a negative regulator of actin polymerization within this
        cell type [ 22 ] . Active Rho is also required for normal
        morphology, motility, and cytolytic activity of IL-2
        activated NK cells [ 23 24 ] . We and others have
        demonstrated the importance of Rho in T lymphocyte
        activation [ 25 26 ] . Given the role played by Rho in the
        regulation of actin microfilaments in other cell types, and
        the indispensability of a functional actin cytoskeleton in
        lymphocyte motility and activation, it is of importance to
        study Rho's role in the regulation of T lymphocyte integrin
        function and maintenance of cytoskeletal organization.
      
      
        Results
        
          Electroporation of C3 induces complete
          ADP-ribosylation of Rho in HPB-ALL
          Western blotting analysis confirmed the presence of
          RhoA (~25 kDa) in the human T cell lines HPB-ALL and CEM
          (Figure 1A). The bacterial toxin C3 from 
          Clostridium botulinum ribosylates
          asparagine 41 of the small GTPase Rho [ 15 16 ] ,
          resulting in its inactivation. C3 (25 μg/ml) was
          electroporated into the T cell line HPB-ALL as described
          in the Materials and Methods. After thorough washing, the
          cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C to allow 
          in vivo ribosylation, then
          sonicated and lysates subjected to further C3
          ribosylation by the addition of 2 μCi [ 32P]-NAD and 1 μg
          of C3 in ribosylation buffer. By this method, any further
          ADP ribosylation of Rho can be identified 
          in vitro after 
          in vivo ribosylation, thus serving
          as a measure of the efficiency of the electroporation
          procedure for introducing C3 exoenzyme into HPB-ALL cells
          [ 31 ] . As figure 1Bdemonstrates, electroporation of C3
          transferase (Figure 1B, lane 3) prior to cell disruption
          prevented further ribosylation of Rho proteins in the
          cell lysates. The technique of electroporation of C3 was
          very efficient, as even longer autoradiographic exposures
          of the gel did not demonstrate incorporation of [
          32P]-NAD (data not shown). Thus electroporation of the
          exoenzyme C3 fully ribosylates Rho 
          in vivo , to the extent that no
          further 
          in vitro ribosylation of Rho can be
          detected after cell lysis.
        
        
          Alteration of HPB-ALL morphology by C3
          exoenzyme
          Inactivation of Rho did not affect the constitutively
          high adhesion of HPB-ALL cells to the extracellular
          matrix protein fibronectin (Fn) (Figure 2). When HPB-ALL
          cells are plated onto β1 integrin substrate such as
          fibronectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1),
          or even antibodies to α4β1 integrins, they respond by
          extending pseudopodia and displaying a highly flattened,
          spread morphology (figure 3, panels 4, 7, and 10, and ref
          [ 32 ] ). However, electroporation of C3 appeared to
          alter HPB-ALL morphology resulting in the extension of
          very fine branched finger-like cellular processes when
          cells were plated on the β1 integrin substrates Fn
          (figure 3, panel 6), VCAM-1 (figure 3, panel 9), or a mAb
          specific for β1 integrins (figure 3, panel 12). This also
          occurred for another T cell line, HSB-1 (data not shown),
          and in activated primary T lymphocytes (Table 1).
          Untreated HPB-ALL, mock electroporated control HPB-ALL,
          or C3 treated HPB-ALL do not extend pseudopodia on the
          non-specific cell attachment substrate poly-L-lysine
          (figure 3, panels 13-15), demonstrating the requirement
          for integrin dependent signals in both the normal
          spreading morphology of HBP-ALL, and the C3 induced
          morphological changes in this cell type.
        
        
          RhoA immunolocalization in normal and C3 treated
          HPB-ALL cells spreading on fibronectin
          Immunolocalization of the GTPase RhoA was performed to
          determine if inactivation by C3 exoenzyme caused spatial
          redistribution of RhoA in HPB-ALL. As figure
          4demonstrates, untreated HPB-ALL cells display a diffuse
          staining pattern of RhoA, with small punctate
          microclusters throughout the normal pseudopodial
          extensions (figure 4, left panels, arrows). Staining with
          secondary antibody alone was negative (data not shown).
          Inactivation of Rho by electroporation of C3 exoenzyme
          did not seem to cause a large overall redistribution of
          RhoA in spread HPB-ALL. However, RhoA appeared to be in
          relatively larger clusters distributed along the aberrant
          pseudopodial structures with no diffuse staining observed
          (figure 4, right panels, arrows).
        
        
          Altered pseudopodia are rich in filamentous
          actin
          The Rho family of GTPases is largely responsible for
          maintenance of cell shape in a variety of cell types, and
          this involves regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. To
          localize filamentous actin within HPB-ALL, cells adherent
          to VCAM-1 were fixed and stained with TRITC-phalloidin.
          Control electroporated cells display rather diffuse
          filamentous actin staining in elongated pseudopodial
          processes that flatten and spread out on their termini,
          and there are multiple filopodia extending from these
          processes and from the cell body (figure 5A, arrows).
          Cells that had been treated with C3 exoenzyme however all
          contain highly enriched filamentous actin within the
          extended pseudopods. This is true on the substrates FN
          and anti-β1 integrin mAb (data not shown). In the C3
          electroporated cells, small filopodia extending from the
          cell body are absent, and multiple branched pseudopodial
          structures are largely enriched in filamentous actin
          (Figure 5B, arrows). Of interest, electroporation of C3
          in conjunction with FITC-labeled monomers of actin did
          not demonstrate incorporation of FITC-actin in the
          altered pseudopods at early time points (data not shown),
          suggesting that the filamentous actin in the altered
          pseudopods initially results from rearrangement of
          pre-formed actin filaments.
        
        
          Time lapse microscopy of C3 treated cells
          In fibroblast models, inactivation of Rho causes
          retraction of pre-formed pseudopods with a resultant
          deposition of parallel tracks of thin dendritic processes
          [ 17 ] , a phenotype ultimately resembling that seen in
          C3 treated HPB-ALL. The phenotype induced by C3 mediated
          ribosylation of Rho in HPB-ALL could result from either
          aberrant retraction of recently formed pseudopods, or
          altered pseudopodial extension. These possibilities were
          explored using video time-lapse microscopy. Figure
          6demonstrates HPB-ALL spreading on VCAM-1 over a period
          of 1 hour, where images from the first 10 minutes were
          obtained from recorded videotape, followed by a 60 minute
          time point. Untreated cells and mock electroporated cells
          demonstrate normal HPB-ALL cell spreading (figure 6, see
          arrows). They extend thick pseudopodia with fanned
          termini, and their cell bodies are flattened and oval in
          shape. The C3 induced phenotype forms at the onset of
          cell spreading (figure 6, see arrows). The finger-like
          extensions initially form from a rounded cell body and
          elongate throughout the duration of the assay. The
          stellate projections are clearly delineated even at their
          termini, and the cell bodies do not demonstrate a
          flattened, oval, or spindle phenotype. Thus, the C3
          induced stellate phenotype is not primarily due to
          aberrant pseudopodial retraction, but an altered
          pseudopodial extension. Also of note was the effect of C3
          on the dynamic maintenance of pseudopodia. Under normal
          or control electroporation conditions, some of the VCAM-1
          adherent cells would retract pseudopodia, then form new
          extensions in different directions. This activity was
          clearly inhibited in the C3 treated cells. Once the
          aberrant finger-like projections were formed, no
          pseudopodial retraction was noted during this time
          period, and the cells became completely immobile.
          Quantification of the original movies indicate that only
          1.7% (1/60) of the C3-treated cells were motile whereas
          34.9% (45/129) of mock-electroporated cells displayed
          motility. See additional file1:C3.movand
          file2:mock.movfor the original movies.

        Discussion
        In the present study, we demonstrate that
        ADP-ribosylation of the GTPase Rho in HPB-ALL cells does
        not result in a decrease in constitutively high adhesion to
        the extracellular matrix component fibronectin. However,
        inactivation of Rho protein does result in the aberrant
        extension of finger-like, branched dendritic projections in
        HBP-ALL cells when plated on the substrates VCAM-1,
        fibronectin, and mAb specific for β1 integrins. Altered
        pseudopodial extension required β1 integrin signaling, as
        C3 treated cells plated on the non-specific cell attachment
        factor poly-L-lysine did not extend dendritic like
        processes. Electroporation of polyclonal antibodies
        specific for RhoA mimicked the C3 induced phenotype (data
        not shown). The C3 induced extensions were rich in
        filamentous actin, and C3 treated HPB-ALL cell bodies
        apparently lacked filopodial actin microspikes, present in
        normal spreading cells. Immunolocalization studies of RhoA
        in C3 treated HBP-ALL cells spreading on fibronectin showed
        no gross differences in RhoA distribution, however clusters
        of RhoA were more delineated along the finger-like
        dendritic processes of the C3 treated cells. Thus,
        functional Rho is required for the proper extension and
        retraction of pseudopods in T lymphocytes on β1 integrin
        substrates.
        A large body of work has described the morphological
        functions regulated by small GTPases of the Rho subfamily.
        Members of this family include RhoA, RhoB, RhoC (which are
        isoforms), Cdc42, G25K, RhoG, Rac1, Rac2, and TC10
        (reviewed in [ 34 ] ). In fibroblast models, these GTPases
        have been proposed to act in a concerted hierarchy to
        coordinately regulate distinct morphological features.
        Filopodia formation of short filamentous actin microspikes
        gives way to membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation,
        culminating in the organized production of actin stress
        fibers. This has lead to the hypothesis that small GTP
        binding proteins act sequentially, in the GTPase cascade
        Cdc42→Rac→Rho [ 35 ] . Facilitating the study of Rho in
        regulation of cell activity has been the use of C3
        exoenzyme, a toxin from 
        Clostridium botulinum that
        ADP-ribosylates [ 15 16 ] and inactivates Rho proteins.
        Although ribosylation of other Rho family proteins such as
        Rac1 can occur with C3 [ 33 ] , this seemed to be very weak
        [ 13 ] . In our work, C3 electroporated into the T cell
        line HPB-ALL caused complete ADP-ribosylation of Rho
        proteins (~25 kDa). Although Rac1 and Cdc42 were identified
        in western blots of whole cell lysates prepared from the T
        cell lines HPB-ALL, CEM, HSB (data not shown), and PB human
        T lymphocytes (data not shown), there was no detection of
        ribosylation in the lower molecular weight Rac and Cdc42
        related GTPases in HPB-ALL cells, indicating the
        specificity of C3.
        Previous reports have demonstrated that ADP-ribosylation
        of B-lymphoid cell lines by C3 treatment inhibits phorbol
        ester induced cellular homotypic aggregation [ 18 ] . Also,
        phorbol ester and chemoattractant (IL-8 and fMLP) induced
        pre-B lymphoblastoid adhesion to VCAM-1 and neutrophil
        adhesion to fibrinogen was abrogated in a dose-dependent
        manner by C3 exoenzyme [ 36 ] . This may indicate that in
        cells of hematopoietic lineages, the induction of an
        increased adhesive state may be susceptible to regulation
        by Rho proteins. However, we have recently demonstrated
        that induced adhesion of primary T lymphocytes to
        fibronectin is unaffected by Rho inactivation [ 25 ] , and
        data presented here suggests that constitutively high
        adhesion of HPB-ALL cells to β1 integrin substrate is
        unaffected by C3 treatment. Others have demonstrated that
        inactivation of Rho in monocytes promotes cellular adhesion
        to β1 integrin substrates [ 37 ] . Static cell adhesion
        studies rely on a number of factors including integrin
        affinity regulation, integrin avidity/clustering, and shear
        resistant cell shape changes. Factors affecting adhesion
        can do so by regulating any number of these parameters.
        Thus the effects due to Rho inactivation on cell adhesion
        may not only influence one or more of these parameters, but
        also be cell type specific even amongst the cells of the
        hematopoeitic lineage.
        The phenotype induced by ADP-ribosylation of Rho in T
        lymphocytes appeared different than that induced in
        fibroblast models, where microinjection of C3 results in
        fibroblast retraction of pseudopodia, with the cell body
        rounding up eventually to become non-adherent [ 17 ] .
        Video time-lapse microscopy demonstrated the elongation of
        aberrant pseudopods in HPB-ALL cells plated on the β1
        substrate VCAM-1, rather than an altered retraction of
        already formed pseudopods. These results suggest an altered
        pseudopodial extension although a defect in contractibility
        could be involved as a secondary mechanism for formation of
        aberrant processes. This phenotype also coincided with the
        complete loss of cellular motility in HPB-ALL, even though
        adhesion to substrate was not noticeably altered. It is
        also important to note that normal and C3 induced aberrant
        HPB-ALL spreading on Fn or VCAM-1 is dependent on signals
        generated through β1 integrins, as both morphologies could
        be seen when untreated or C3 treated HPB-ALL were plated on
        the β1 specific mAb 33B6. When these same cells are plated
        on the non-specific cell attachment factor poly-L-lysine,
        cells remain round and no spreading occurs. The elongated
        dendritic-like processes in C3 treated HPB-ALL cells were
        F-actin rich. This phenotype caused by inactivation of Rho
        is the first to be described in T lymphocytes, however, Rho
        regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is not novel among
        cells of the hematopoietic lineage. ADP-ribosylation of Rho
        proteins in chemoattractant stimulated neutrophils [ 20 21
        ] and in both monocytic lines and fresh blood monocytes [
        22 38 ] results in actin filament polymerization. Although
        this once again highlights differences between the affects
        of C3 in fibroblasts and leukocytes, there may be
        commonalties amongst cells that do not form distinct actin
        stress fibers, such as leukocytes and neuronal cells.
        ADP-ribosylation of Rho proteins by C3 exoenzyme prevents
        neurite retraction in the specialized growth cone of
        developing neurons, and in fact promotes neurite outgrowth
        in the same fashion as microinjection of purified dominant
        negative RhoA T19N [ 39 ] . In these instances, neuronal
        N1E-115 cell outgrowth induced by inactivation of RhoA was
        mimicked by microinjection of Rac1- or Cdc42-GST fusion
        proteins, and could be abolished by coinjection of dominant
        negative Cdc42 T17Nor Rac1 T17N [ 39 ] . From these
        results, the authors concluded that inactivation of RhoA by
        C3 exoenzyme treatment resulted in the activation of Rac1
        and Cdc42 GTPases, suggesting the mutually exclusive
        function of RhoA and Rac1/Cdc42. Cdc42 has been implicated
        in the formation of small, actin-rich filopodia [ 34 ] ,
        which are similar to those seen on spread HPB-ALL cells
        (figure 5) around the periphery of the cell body and
        extended pseudopods. After C3 electroporation, HPB-ALL were
        allowed to spread on VCAM-1 for 1 hour, and
        TRITC-phalloidin staining demonstrated the complete absence
        of fine filopodial structures. Given the morphologic
        similarity between neurite outgrowth of N1E-115 cells and
        the aberrant pseudopodial extension of HPB-ALL when RhoA is
        inhibited with C3 exoenzyme, it will be interesting to
        determine if other GTPases such as Rac or Cdc42 are
        activated to promote this phenotype after C3 treatment of
        HPB-ALL cells. The thick actin rich stellate projections
        emanating from the cell body of C3 electroporated HPB-ALL
        may be the result of condensation of filopodia, where Cdc42
        may be induced into a highly active state. Actin filament
        elongation would continue and RhoA dependent retraction of
        filamentous actin would be abrogated. This could occur by
        the release of limited effector molecules shared between
        the two GTPases, possibilities that are currently under
        investigation.
        The immunolocalization of RhoA in normal and C3 treated
        cells did not appear drastically different in that RhoA was
        apparent in both normal and aberrant pseudopodial
        extensions. The notable exception was that clusters of RhoA
        appeared less diffuse in the altered pseudopods of C3
        treated cells (figure 6). Although ADP-ribosylation of Rho
        does not significantly alter the subcellular distribution
        of RhoA, Rho activity is inhibited. This is thought to
        prevent activation of downstream Rho targets required for
        normal integrin dependent morphological changes. A number
        of potential downstream Rho effector molecules have been
        identified recently. These include p150 RhoA-binding kinase
        α and β (p150 ROKα and β) [ 40 41 ] , p160 Rho-associated
        coiled-coil containing protein kinase (Rho-p160ROCK) [ 42 ]
        , p164 Rho kinase [ 43 ] , p120 protein kinase N (p120 PKN)
        [ 44 45 ] , and PKC-related kinase-2 (PRK-2) [ 46 ] . These
        kinases specifically bind to the GTP bound form of Rho,
        except for PRK-2, which can bind both Rho and Rac GTPases.
        Interestingly, inhibition of Rho-p160ROCK has recently been
        shown to give similar lymphocyte morphology as inhibition
        of Rho with C3 [ 50 ] . Another interesting candidate may
        be p120 PKN, as recent studies have established that PKN
        phosphorylates cytoskeletal intermediate filaments [ 47 ]
        and is directly linked to the cytoskeletal network through
        associations with α-actinin [ 48 ] . Also, PKN may be
        involved in relating cytoplasmic signals to the nucleus,
        for in response to stress, nuclear translocation of PKN
        occurs [ 49 ] . This is particularly important in light of
        previous work demonstrating that inactivation of Rho in
        peripheral blood T lymphocytes inhibits costimulatory
        signals up-regulating IL-2 production [ 25 ] . Future
        experiments will focus on determining the relationship of
        Rho GTPases and the regulation of T cell morphology [ 25 51
        52 ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        Inactivation of Rho results in an active elongation of
        actin rich, finger-like dendritic processes dependent on β1
        integrin signaling. Thus Rho activity is required for T
        lymphocyte spreading morphologies, and is required for T
        lymphocyte motility. In static cell adhesion assays,
        however, Rho activity is not required to maintain
        constitutively high levels of adhesion to fibronectin.
        Further study of Rho and it's related GTPases and
        downstream effector molecules, will be important in
        elucidating mechanisms regulating the lymphocyte
        cytoskeleton and thus T cell function.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Reagents
          Poly-L-lysine was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.
          (St. Louis, MO). Fn was affinity purified from 200 ml of
          human plasma (Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center, Houston,
          TX). Briefly, gelatin-conjugated sepharose bead columns
          were pre-washed with PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM
          PMSF. After washing, plasma containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.1
          mM PMSF was passed over the column twice, then washed
          with at least 4 volumes of PBS/EDTA/PMSF. Elution of FN
          from the columns was performed with 4 M urea in 0.15 M
          NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.
          Collected fractions were dialyzed in PBS. All procedures
          were carried out at RT. Fn purity was determined by
          SDS-PAGE. VCAM-1 was provided by Dr. S. Fong (Genentech,
          San Francisco, CA). C3 exoenzyme was purified as
          previously described [ 25 ] . Anti-β1 integrin mAb 33B6
          and anti α4β1 integrin mAb 19H8 were generated in this
          laboratory and have been previously described [ 27 28 ] .
          Rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdc42, -Rac1, -Rac2, -RhoA, and
          mouse monoclonal anti-Ras, were purchased from Santa Cruz
          Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).
        
        
          Cells
          The T cell lines HPB-ALL and CEM were maintained in
          complete media (RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS; 10
          U/ml of both penicillin and streptomycin; and 1 mM
          L-Glutamine, all from Life Technologies, Grand Island,
          NY). Freshly isolated peripheral blood T cells were
          purified and activated by cross-linking CD28 and CD3 as
          previously described [ 29 ] .
        
        
          Time Lapse and Fluorescence Microscopy
          HPB-ALL cells were plated on VCAM-1 in the temperature
          controlled environment of an inverted Nikon (Melville,
          NY) Diaphot-TMD microscope for 1 hour. During this time,
          images were obtained through an Optronics (Galeto, CA)
          VI-470 CCD camera and recorded by time-lapse
          cinematography on a Panasonic (Secaucus, NJ) sVHS AG-6730
          time-lapse videocassette recorder. Recordings were played
          back and digitized on a Macintosh IIVX computer equipped
          with a Data Translation (Marlboro, MA) Frame Grabber card
          using NIH IMAGE software (available from
          ftp://codon.nih.gov/pub/nih-image/nih-image161_fat.hqx).
          For fluorescence microscopy, glass coverslips were
          coated with Fn (10 μg/ml), VCAM-1 (5 μg/ml) or mAb 19H8
          (0.5 μg/ml) for at least 2 hours at 37°C in 50 mM Tris
          (pH 9.5). Coverslips were blocked with BSA (1% w/v in
          PBS) for 30 min at room temperature then washed with PBS.
          HPB-ALL cells were then plated onto the coverslips and
          incubated for 1 hour at 37°C in complete media. The cells
          were then washed on the coverslips, and fixed with 2%
          paraformaldehyde for at least 30 min at 4°C. A solution
          of 0.1% TritonX-100 was then used to permeabilize the
          cells by treatment for 10 min at 4°C. After
          permeabilization, coverslips were again blocked with 1%
          BSA. After washing in PBS, 80 μM phalloidin-TRITC or 1
          μg/ml anti-RhoA antibody was incubated for 30 min at 4°C.
          Cells were visualized on a Nikon DIAPHOT-TMD inverted
          microscope and images were digitized as described
          above.
        
        
          Western Blotting
          All western blotting steps were carried out at 4°C for
          at least 2 hours. Cell lysates from approximately 2 × 10
          6cell equivalents were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE,
          transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-rad, Richmond, CA),
          then blocked with 5% BSA and 5% non-fat milk. Membranes
          were extensively washed, then incubated with the primary
          (0.5 μg/ml) polyclonal anti-RhoA. After washing,
          membranes were incubated with Goat anti-rabbit polyclonal
          antibody conjugated to HRP (Cappel, Durham, NC).
          Chemiluminescence was performed as described by the
          manufacturer (Pierce, Rockford, IL).
        
        
          Cell Adhesion Assays
          Adhesion assays were performed in modified Tyrodes
          buffer [ 30 ] composed of 12 mM NaHCO 
          3 (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2
          mM MgCl 
          2 , 1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mg/ml glucose.
          Plates were pre-coated with Fn (10 μg/ml) for at least 2
          hours at RT in 0.1 M NaHCO 
          3 . BSA (2% w/v) was then added to
          block unbound sites. Cells were resuspended in modified
          Tyrodes buffer. After the cells were added to the washed
          plates in 100 μl of modified tyrodes (1 × 10 5cells),
          plates were spun at 300 rpm for 5 min, then incubated for
          45 min at 37°C and 5% CO 
          2 . Two images were digitized (see
          above) from each well before washing, then plates were
          carefully washed 4 × with pre-warmed (37°C) modified
          Tyrodes buffer. After washing, images from the same
          position were digitized. Cell numbers were quantitated
          using NIH Image software, and adhesion assays are graphed
          as the percentage of input cells remaining after
          washing.
        
        
          Electroporation of C3 into HPB-ALL cells
          HPB-ALL cells were washed in RPMI-1640 and resuspended
          between 1-2 × 10 6cells per 100 μl RPMI-1640. Control
          cells were electroporated with the indicated control
          buffers. Cell samples were placed into pre-chilled (4°C)
          4 mm or 1 mm electroporation cuvettes (BTX Inc., San
          Diego, CA) and electroporated under the following
          conditions: 500 V/capacitance and resistance, 1250 μF
          capacitance timing, 720 ohms resistance, and 270 V for 4
          mm gap cuvettes or 68 V for 1 mm gap cuvettes (field
          strength of ~700 Vcm -1). Both antibodies and C3 were
          electroporated at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml,
          incubated on ice for 5 min, then washed with complete
          media at room temperature and used for assays. Control
          buffer for electroporation of C3 consisted of the buffers
          used in the purification of C3, including the appropriate
          concentration of bovine α-thrombin [ 25 ] . All
          electroporation of proteins were carried out on an
          Electro Cell Manipulator 600 (BTX Inc.). This procedure
          had previously been optimized for intracellular
          incorporation of macromolecules by electroporation of
          goat anti-mouse FITC conjugated antibodies.
          Electroporation efficiency during the optimization
          procedure was monitored by FACS analysis and fluorescence
          imaging (data not shown).
        
        
          C3 Ribosylation
          Purified C3 or BSA control were electroporated at a
          concentration of 25 μg/ml. After electroporation, cells
          were transferred into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes and
          incubated for 1 hr at 37°C to allow ribosylation. Cells
          were then washed extensively in 1% BSA/PBS to remove any
          C3 not incorporated into the cells. Next, the cells were
          resuspended at 3 × 10 6cells/ml in ice cold sonication
          buffer (250 mM sucrose; 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 1 mM EDTA; 5
          mM MgCl 
          2 ; 1 mM DTT; 0.1 mM GTP; 1 μg/ml
          leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin; 1
          mM PMSF) and sonicated for 10 seconds. After sonication
          with a Sonic Dismembrator Model 300 with microtip
          (Fisher), 100 μl of the mixture was added to 50 μl of 3 ×
          reaction buffer containing 150 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 30 mM
          thymidine; 3 mM DTT; 5 mM MgCl 
          2 , 0.3 mM GTP. To this mixture, 1.0
          μg purified C3 and 2 μCi [ 32P]-NAD (NEN-Dupont, Boston,
          MA) were added. After incubation for 1 hr at 37°C, SDS
          was added to 2% final w/v and this mixture was immersed
          in a boiling water bath for 10 min. Eight volumes of ice
          cold ethanol was then added, and these samples were kept
          at -20°C for at least 1 hr. Precipitated proteins were
          pelleted, and dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer by
          boiling for 10 min. Samples were then subjected to 12.5%
          SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography.
