        Heterotrimeric G proteins couple agonist-activated
        heptahelical receptors to a variety of effector responses.
        For the most part, this signaling activity takes place at
        the plasma membranes of cells. However, G proteins have
        been detected at a variety of subcellular locations and
        have been implicated in numerous membrane trafficking
        activities [ 1 2 ] . This suggests that distinct, though
        not yet determined, mechanisms exist to target G protein
        subunits to subcellular locations other than plasma
        membranes (PM). Furthermore, post-transcriptional or
        post-translational modifications may play a role in
        directing a G protein subunit to a specific intracellular
        location.
        Unique subcellular localization has been observed for a
        novel alternative spliced form of the G protein α subunit
        (Gα), α 
        i2 [ 3 ] . This α 
        i2 splice variant, termed sα 
        i2 , contains a novel 35 amino acid
        sequence that replaces the C-terminal 24 amino acids of α 
        i2 [ 3 ] . sα 
        i2 has been observed to localize to
        Golgi membranes and other intracellular membranes [ 3 4 ] ;
        in contrast, wild type α 
        i2 is typically found at PM. Based on
        this unique localization of sα 
        i2 , a prominent role in membrane
        trafficking has been proposed for this subunit [ 3 ] .
        However, no report to date has supported a functional role
        for sα 
        i2 in vesicular transport, although a
        variety of functional assays have implicated other Gα,
        including α 
        s and α 
        i3 , in vesicle trafficking pathways [ 1
        2 ] .
        In spite of its unknown functional significance, sα 
        i2 provides a potential model for
        studying mechanisms of subcellular localization of Gα.
        Clearly, some aspect of the novel splicing is responsible
        for the difference in subcellular targeting of sα 
        i2 ( 
        i.e. , Golgi and intracellular
        membranes) compared to wild type α 
        i2 ( 
        i.e., PM). To address the mechanism
        of subcellular localization of sα 
        i2 , two hypotheses were tested herein.
        First, the possibility was tested that the novel 35 amino
        acid sequence found at the C-terminus of sα 
        i2 functions as a specific Golgi or
        intracellular membrane targeting motif. A second
        possibility was suggested by considering the location of
        the splice site. Several studies have shown that deletions
        or amino acid substitutions in the extreme C-terminal
        region of Gα creates a protein defective in
        guanine-nucleotide binding [ 5 6 7 8 9 10 ] . Rapid release
        of guanine-nucleotides can result in an unstable Gα [ 9 10
        ] . This leads to the prediction that sα 
        i2 is also unstable due to a disruption
        in the structure of its C-terminus caused by the novel
        splice sequence. Thus, the second possibility is that
        failure of sα 
        i2 to localize at the PM but instead
        localize at intracellular membranes is the result of a
        general defect in protein stability. Results presented
        herein are consistent with this second hypothesis.
      
      
        Results
        α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 differ only at their extreme
        C-termini. Alternative splicing results in a novel 35 amino
        acids in sα 
        i2 that replace the C-terminal 24 amino
        acids of α 
        i2 (Figure 1). In the studies presented
        here, both α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 contain an internal EE epitope, as
        used previously for α 
        i2 [ 11 12 ] . The use of the EE epitope
        allows the direct comparison of subcellular localization
        and expression of α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 , and facilitates immunoprecipitation
        of the two expressed proteins. This is essential since
        suitable antibodies to detect and immuno-isolate sα 
        i2 are not readily available. Attempts
        to use a previously described polyclonal antibody directed
        against the C-terminus of sα 
        i2 [ 3 4 ] were unsatisfactory in our
        hands. In particular, attempts to detect endogenous sα 
        i2 by immunofluorescence failed due to
        faint detection that showed drastically different patterns
        of staining depending upon fixation technique.
        The subcellular localization of expressed α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 was compared in COS and BHK cells
        (Figure 2). In both cell types, α 
        i2 was detected at cellular plasma
        membranes as highlighted by bright staining at the cell
        periphery (Figure 2Aand 2C). In contrast, sα 
        i2 was not detected at plasma membranes,
        but instead typically displayed an intracellular and
        perinuclear staining pattern (Figure 2Band 2D), consistent
        with localization to intracellular membranes as previously
        described [ 3 4 ] . The subcellular localization of sα 
        i2 showed overlap in immunofluorescent
        staining with the Golgi protein, β-COP (Figure 3Aand 3B)
        and the endoplasmic reticulum protein PDI (Figure 3Cand
        3D); localization of sα 
        i2 exclusively to Golgi was not
        observed, even at the lowest levels of detection.
        Subcellular fractionation confirmed that sα 
        i2 was localized, at least partly, to
        membranes (Figure 2E). After lysis of cells in hypotonic
        buffer followed by high-speed centrifugation, α 
        i2 was found predominantly in the
        particulate fraction from COS (Figure 2E, lanes 3 and 4) or
        BHK cells (Figure 2E, lanes 9 and 10). A majority of sα 
        i2 was also detected in the particulate
        fraction from both COS (Figure 2E, lanes 5 and 6) and BHK
        cells (Figure 2E, lanes 11 and 12), although some was also
        found in the soluble fraction. As a comparison, a
        non-palmitoylated mutant of α 
        q , in which cysteines 9 and 10 have
        been substituted with serines, is found predominantly in
        the soluble fraction (Figure 2E, lanes 7 and 8), as
        described previously [ 13 ] . Surprisingly, in comparison
        to α 
        i2 , sα 
        i2 was always detected in fewer cells,
        by immunofluorescence analysis, and showed lower levels of
        protein expression, by western blot analysis of subcellular
        fractions (Figure 2E) or whole cell lysates (not shown).
        These expression differences suggested that sα 
        i2 was either less efficiently expressed
        or more rapidly degraded compared to α 
        i2 , as described below.
        The C-terminal 35 amino acids of sα 
        i2 , which replace the C-terminal 24
        amino acids of α 
        i2 (Figure 1), have been proposed to
        function as a Golgi targeting signal [ 3 4 ] . To test the
        potential importance of this C-terminal region in
        localization of sα 
        i2 to intracellular membranes and
        prevention of sα 
        i2 from localizing to PM, a deletion
        mutant of α 
        i2 was constructed consisting of amino
        acids 1-331. In sα 
        i2 , the C-terminal splice occurs just
        after amino acid 331 (Figure 1), and thus the novel 35
        amino acid splice sequence is removed in α 
        i2 (1-331). Immunofluorescence
        microscopy indicates that α 
        i2 (1-331) (Figure 4B) displays a
        subcellular localization pattern very similar to sα 
        i2 (Figure 4A). This result is
        consistent with the alternative hypothesis that a
        disruption of α 
        i2 at the C-terminus creates a protein
        unable to localize at the PM.
        If the unique C-terminal 35 amino acid sequence of sα 
        i2 functions as a Golgi targeting
        signal, it is important to test whether it is sufficient to
        target a heterologous protein to intracellular membranes.
        When the 35 amino acid sequence was fused to the C-terminus
        of GFP (GFP-sα 
        i2 35aa), this unique sα 
        i2 sequence failed to direct GFP to
        intracellular membranes (Figure 5B); GFP-sα 
        i2 35aa was diffusely distributed
        throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, similar to what is
        observed for GFP alone (Figure 5A). On the other hand, when
        the first ten amino acids of α 
        i2 are fused to GFP to create α 
        i2 (1-10)-GFP, fluorescence is detected
        strongly at the PM (Figure 5C), indicating the N-terminus
        of α 
        i2 , which contains the sites for
        myristoylation and palmitoylation [ 14 ] , can be
        sufficient for directing PM localization of a normally
        cytosolic protein. In agreement with these results, the sα 
        i2 C-terminal sequence failed to
        redirect the localization of a secreted or a nuclear
        protein [ 4 ] . Thus, not only is the unique sα 
        i2 sequence unable to override other
        localization signals, it is unable to target a cytoplasmic
        protein to intracellular membranes. These results are
        consistent with a lack of a specific role for the sα 
        i2 sequence in Golgi membrane
        targeting.
        The above experimental results failed to support the
        hypothesis that the unique 35 amino acid sequence from sα 
        i2 serves as a specific Golgi or
        intracellular membrane targeting motif. Thus, the following
        experiments concentrated on addressing the alternative
        hypothesis: sα 
        i2 is unstable and rapidly degraded due
        to disruptions in the C-terminus, and such instability
        results in a failure of sα 
        i2 to reach its proper place at the
        PM.
        The ability of α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 to undergo N-terminal lipid
        modifications was compared. Myristoylation occurs
        co-translationally at the extreme N-terminal glycine, while
        palmitoylation occurs post-translationally at a cysteine
        immediately after the myristoylated glycine [ 15 ] . The
        subcellular site where palmitoylation occurs has not been
        well defined, although in one model palmitoylation occurs
        at the PM [ 16 ] . Cells expressing α 
        i2 or sα 
        i2 were metabolically labeled with
        3H-palmitate or 3H-myristate. α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 were immunoprecipitated from cell
        extracts, and incorporation of radio-label was analyzed by
        SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography (Figure 6A). No
        palmitoylation of sα 
        i2 was detected (Figure 6A, lane 3),
        although α 
        i2 was strongly palmitoylated (Figure
        6A, lane 2). In contrast, both α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 incorporated similar levels or
        myristate (Figure 6A, lanes 5 and 6). The similar level of
        myristoylation was particularly surprising since total sα 
        i2 protein was much lower than α 
        i2 as determined by immunoblotting of
        the immunoprecipitates (Figure 6B, compare lanes 5 and 6).
        Myristoylation is a co-translational modification, and
        levels of radio-labeling should thus reflect synthesis of
        new protein. Accordingly, the myristoylation results
        (Figure 6Aand 6B, lanes 5 and 6) strongly suggested that α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 are translated equally well, as
        evidenced by similar levels of radiolabeled myristate
        incorporation during the labeling period, but sα 
        i2 is more rapidly degraded, as seen by
        reduced steady-state levels of immunoprecipitated protein.
        The lack of palmitoylation of sα 
        i2 is consistent with at least two, not
        necessarily mutually exclusive, possibilities. sα 
        i2 may fail to undergo palmitoylation
        because it is not stable long enough for post-translational
        palmitoylation to occur or because it fails to reach a PM
        site of palmitoylation. Alternatively, the novel C-terminal
        sequence of sα 
        i2 may somehow prevent direct
        recognition by a palmitoyl transferase.
        Cells expressing high levels of sα 
        i2 , and to a much lesser extent α 
        i2 , often displayed very bright
        intracellular accumulations of sα 
        i2 as visualized by immunofluorescence.
        These large spots were reminiscent of recently described
        aggresomes, accumulations of misfolded protein that are
        being targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation [ 17 18
        ] . This observation suggested the possibility that
        intracellular localization of sα 
        i2 may reflect targeting to a
        proteasome-dependent degradative pathway. To test this idea
        further, cells expressing α 
        i2 or sα 
        i2 were treated with the proteasome
        inhibitor acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN) and
        changes in localization of the α subunit were analyzed by
        immunofluorescence (Figure 7). After 1h treatment with
        ALLN, α 
        i2 localization is relatively unaffected
        (Figure 7C), but sα 
        i2 begins to show a slight increase in
        distinct intracellular accumulations (Figure 7D). At 4 h
        ALLN treatment, many cells expressing α 
        i2 display a decrease in PM localization
        and an increase in intracellular staining (Figure 7E). α 
        i2 is typically seen in large bright
        spots and in a perinuclear/intracellular membrane staining
        pattern after incubation of cells for 4 h with ALLN. In
        fact, the localization pattern of α 
        i2 after 4 h incubation with ALLN
        (Figure 7E) is similar to the observed localization of sα 
        i2 in the absence or presence of ALLN
        treatment (Figure 7B, 7D, and 7F). At 8 h treatment with
        ALLN, both α 
        i2 (Figure 7G) and sα 
        i2 (Figure 7H) are detected almost
        exclusively as a large bright spot in each expressing cell.
        Similar results were obtained using another proteasome
        inhibitor, MG-132. Interestingly, ALLN treatment was
        relatively ineffective at promoting accumulation of
        overexpressed α 
        s in aggresome-like structures (not
        shown). Thus, the results of Figure 7are consistent with
        the proposal that the intracellular localization of sα 
        i2 is due to its targeting to a
        degradative pathway, a pathway shared by α 
        i2 .
        The subcellular localization of sα 
        i2 was compared to α 
        i2 A327S. This alanine to serine
        mutation in the C-terminal region of α 
        i1 (A326S) and α 
        s (A366S) has been shown to greatly
        accelerate GDP release, to accelerate irreversible
        inactivation 
        in vitro , and to cause rapid
        turnover of the α subunit in cultured cells [ 9 10 ] .
        Thus, if the observed intracellular localization of sα 
        i2 is caused by instability of the
        protein due to disruptions at its C-terminus, then it
        follows that α 
        i2 A327S should show a similar pattern
        of localization. Indeed, immunofluorescence microscopy
        revealed a pronounced intracellular distribution for α 
        i2 A327S (Figure 8E). In addition to
        intracellular membrane localization similar to sα 
        i2 (Figure 8C), α 
        i2 A327S was detected weakly but
        consistently at the PM. It seems likely that the C-terminal
        disruption of sα 
        i2 (replacing the 24 C-terminal amino
        acids) is a more severe disruption than the A327S
        substitution. Thus, the similarity in localization of sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 A327S bolsters the idea that
        mislocalization of sα 
        i2 is caused by its inherent
        instability.
        G protein βγ subunits can stabilize wild type and
        alanine to serine mutant α subunits 
        in vitro [ 10 ] . Thus, the effect of
        βγ co-expression on subcellular localization of α 
        i2 A327S and sα 
        i2 was tested. α 
        i2 localizes to the PM efficiently when
        expressed alone (Figure 8A) or when co-expressed with βγ
        (Figure 8B). sα 
        i2 shows a dramatic change in
        localization when co-expressed with βγ (Figure 8D),
        displaying strong PM staining. Not only is sα 
        i2 targeted efficiently to the PM when
        co-expressed with βγ, but βγ co-expression increases
        overall levels of transiently expressed sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 , as determined by immunoblotting
        (Figure 8G), and increases the number of cells expressing
        sα 
        i2 , as observed by immunofluorescence
        microscopy (not shown). Similarly, co-expression of βγ
        efficiently promotes PM localization of α 
        i2 A327S (Figure 8F).
        The analysis of the effect of βγ was extended by
        examining the localization of α 
        i2 or sα 
        i2 after co-transfection with βγ and
        after treatment with ALLN. In contrast to Figure 7, a
        marked difference was observed between α 
        i2 and sα 
        i2 after ALLN treatment. When βγ is
        co-expressed with α 
        i2 , PM localization of α 
        i2 is observed, as shown in Figure 8B,
        and incubation with ALLN for 8 h shows little effect on PM
        localization of α 
        i2 (Figure 9A). When βγ is co-expressed
        with sα 
        i2 , PM localization of sα 
        i2 is observed, as shown in Figure 8D,
        but incubation with ALLN for 8 h causes an increase in
        bright intracellular accumulations of sα 
        i2 (Figure 9B). Taken together, results
        with βγ co-expression are consistent with the ability of βγ
        to promote PM targeting of Gα, and further suggest that sα 
        i2 is less effectively stabilized than α
        
        i2 by βγ, as evidenced by ALLN-induced
        accumulation in intracellular aggregates (Figure 9B).
        Lastly, 35S-methionine pulse-chase labeling studies
        directly confirmed that sα 
        i2 was more rapidly degraded than α 
        i2 (Figure 10). After transient
        expression of the α subunits, cellular proteins were
        radiolabeled with a brief pulse of 35S-methionine followed
        by a chase. Immunoprecipitation of the α subunit after
        increasing times of chase, followed by SDS-PAGE and
        fluorography revealed that radiolabeled sα 
        i2 was rapidly lost. α 
        i2 consistently displayed a 3-4 fold
        longer half-life compared to sα 
        i2 , while α 
        i2 A327S was intermediate. In the
        experiment presented in Figure 10, the t 
        1/2 was determined to be approximately
        90, 180, and 360 min for sα 
        i2 , α 
        i2 A327S, and α 
        i2 , respectively. Although this trend
        was consistent, the exact t 
        1/2 showed some variability from
        experiment to experiment, probably due to varying levels of
        transient overexpression. It is likely that the difference
        in turnover of sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 is even more profound when the
        proteins are expressed at lower levels. Consistent with
        this idea, sα 
        i2 was refractory to stable expression
        even though cells stably expressing α 
        i2 were easily selected (not shown). The
        inability to isolate cells stably expressing sα 
        i2 can be attributed to its rapid
        degradation. Regardless, 35S-methionine pulse-chase
        labeling studies (Figure 10) demonstrate that sα 
        i2 is indeed more rapidly degraded than
        α 
        i2 .
      
      
        Discussion
        In addition to their well characterized role at the PM
        in coupling activated GPCRs to effector proteins,
        heterotrimeric G proteins have been implicated in a variety
        of other cellular functions, including membrane trafficking
        pathways. A splice variant of α 
        i2 , termed sα 
        i2 , has been proposed as a candidate to
        regulate vesicle transport due to its localization at
        intracellular membranes. The studies described in this
        report were undertaken to define mechanisms that underlie
        subcellular localization of sα 
        i2 . The novel 35 amino acids found in
        sα 
        i2 appear not to function as a specific
        Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence. Instead,
        the results in this study support the proposal that sα 
        i2 fails to target to the PM because it
        is an unstable protein. The following results support this
        hypothesis: 1) sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 are equally labeled by a pulse of
        3H-myristate, although much less sα 
        i2 protein is detected; 2) sα 
        i2 displays a propensity to localize to
        potential aggresome-like structures, and this localization
        is greatly enhanced by proteasome inhibitor treatment; 3)
        the α 
        i2 A327S mutant, previously shown to be
        unstable and defective in guanine-nucleotide binding, shows
        a similar pattern of subcellular localization ( 
        i.e., intracellular membranes rather
        than PM); 4) βγ over-expression increases expression of sα 
        i2 and promotes PM localization of sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 A327S, but βγ co-expression does not
        prevent sα 
        i2 localization to potential
        aggresome-like structures when cells are treated with
        proteasome inhibitors; and 5) pulse-chase analysis
        indicates that sα 
        i2 is rapidly degraded.
        A number of reports have demonstrated that disruptions
        in the C-termini of Gα cause reduced affinity for
        guanine-nucleotides and protein instability. The C-terminal
        30 amino acids of Gα consist of the β6-α5 loop, followed by
        the α5 helix and finally several amino acids of flexible
        structure (Figure 1) [ 19 20 21 ] . The β6-α5 loop
        stabilizes the guanine ring of bound GDP or GTP, and
        mutations in this region affect guanine-nucleotide binding.
        The A326S mutation of α 
        i1 and A366S mutation of α 
        s (cognate to the α 
        i2 A327S used in this study) were shown
        to cause greatly decreased affinity for GDP [ 9 10 ] .
        Defective binding of GDP leads to more Gα in the empty
        state (no bound guanine-nucleotide), and this form of Gα is
        rapidly denatured 
        in vitro , as shown for α 
        s A366S and α 
        i1 A326S [ 9 10 ] . Moreover, α 
        s A366S was demonstrated to undergo
        rapid degradation (t 
        1/2 < 1 h) in stably transfected
        cells [ 9 ] . The same mutation in α 
        t has also been shown to greatly
        decrease guanine-nucleotide binding [ 5 22 ] . Additional
        amino acids in the critical β6-α5 loop are important for
        maintaining Gα integrity [ 7 ] .
        Although the α5 helix (Figure 1) does not directly
        contact the bound guanine-nucleotide [ 19 20 21 ] , it is
        clearly important for Gα structure and to maintain the
        proper orientation of the β6-α5 loop. A recent study
        identified a number of α5 helix residues in α 
        t that when changed to alanines
        increased rates of guanine-nucleotide exchange ( 
        i.e., decreased affinity for
        guanine-nucleotides) [ 5 ] . Individual mutation of amino
        acids in α 
        t , cognate to T330, N332, V333, F337 in
        α 
        i2 (Figure 1), increased nucleotide
        exchange rates [ 5 ] . Two of these critical amino acids,
        N332 and V333 in α 
        i2 , are in fact the first two amino
        acids that are replaced by the novel splicing in sα 
        i2 (Figure 1). Thus, one might speculate
        that the novel 35 amino acid sequence in sα 
        i2 would impair guanine-nucleotide
        binding and result in a unstable protein. Unfortunately,
        initial attempts to directly show a defect in
        guanine-nucleotide binding by sα 
        i2 , using a GTPγ S-dependent trypsin
        protection assay [ 23 ] , were unsuccessful due, at least
        in part, to the inability to solubilize expressed sα 
        i2 from membranes using a mild detergent
        ( 
        e.g., lubrol/polyoxyethylene
        10-lauryl ether).
        The data in this report are consistent with a scenario
        in which intracellular Golgi/ER localization of sα 
        i2 reflects its rapid degradation rather
        than specific targeting to a subcellular organelle.
        Particularly compelling is the similarity in subcellular
        localization of α 
        i2 A327S and sα 
        i2 (Figure 8). In addition, the use of
        proteasome inhibitors (Figures 7and 9) suggest that sα 
        i2 is degraded by a proteasome pathway.
        The observed intracellular membrane (ER) localization and
        proteasome inhibitor-induced juxtanuclear aggregate
        accumulation (aggresome) is consistent with that reported
        for other proteins being degraded by such a pathway [ 18 24
        ] . When treated with proteasome inhibitors, overexpressed
        wild type α 
        i2 also accumulates in aggresome-like
        structures (Figure 7), suggesting that Gα may normally be
        degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway. However,
        over-expression of βγ prevents ALLN-induced juxtanuclear
        accumulations of α 
        i2 but not sα 
        i2 (Figure 9). Although little is known
        regarding degradative pathways for G proteins, sα 
        i2 and other mutants ( 
        e.g., α 
        i2 A327S) may be valuable tools for
        defining such pathways.
        The data presented here argue against a sequence
        specific Golgi membrane targeting function for the novel 35
        amino acid sequence found in sα 
        i2 . The novel sequence of sα 
        i2 is not sufficient to direct other
        proteins to Golgi/ER membranes. These 35 amino acids did
        not change the cytoplasmic localization of GFP (Figure 5).
        Similarly, a recent report showed that the sα 
        i2 35 amino acids were unable to retain
        a secreted protein in intracellular membranes and did not
        affect localization of a nuclear protein [ 4 ] . However,
        in addition to causing rapid degradation, one cannot rule
        out that the 35 amino acid sequence of sα 
        i2 functions somehow as part of a Golgi
        targeting motif in the context of other regions of α 
        i2 , as suggested [ 4 ] . Other
        researchers have described a specific Golgi membrane
        localization of sα 
        i2 [ 4 ] ; in contrast, the results
        presented in this report always show a much more disperse
        subcellular localization of sα 
        i2 to intracellular membranes consistent
        with staining of both Golgi and ER. The reason for this
        difference in localization is unclear. Interestingly, in
        the other study, the authors found that deletion of a
        proline-rich sequence corresponding to sα 
        i2 amino acids 348-359 (Figure 1)
        changed localization of sα 
        i2 from Golgi membranes to a more
        diffuse localization throughout intracellular membranes [ 4
        ] . However, mutation of proline residues to alanines
        failed to affect sα 
        i2 localization [ 4 ] . Thus, little
        evidence exists to support a specific membrane targeting
        role for the novel sα 
        i2 sequence.
        βγ was able to promote plasma membrane localization of
        sα 
        i2 (Figure 8). βγ prevents irreversible
        inactivation of α 
        i1 , when measured 
        in vitro at 37°C, and slows the
        inactivation of α 
        i1 A326S [ 10 ] . Thus, βγ may stabilize
        sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 A327S allowing βγ-dependent [ 25 26
        27 28 29 ] PM localization. These results are also
        consistent with the possibility that the primary defect in
        sα 
        i2 is a reduced ability to interact with
        βγ; Gα containing mutations in known sites of contact with
        βγ fail to localize to PM, but over-expression of βγ can
        rescue their PM localization [ 28 29 ] . However, the
        crystal structures [ 30 31 ] show that the C-terminal β6-α5
        loop/α5 helix region does not directly contact βγ. Thus, it
        is more likely that indeed sα 
        i2 is deficient in binding to βγ, but
        this effect is a consequence of its instability. sα 
        i2 may exist in a state that does not
        interact well with βγ simply because it is in the process
        of being irreversibly inactivated [ 9 10 ] . Similarly, α 
        i2 A327S appears not to be defective in
        its intrinsic ability to interact βγ [ 10 ] , and
        co-expression of βγ shifts α 
        i2 A327S, like sα 
        i2 , from intracellular to plasma
        membranes (Figure 8).
        What is the cellular function of sα 
        i2 ? The ability of βγ to promote PM
        localization of sα 
        i2 raises the possibility that
        endogenous sα 
        i2 is in fact localized to PM where it
        can interact with GPCRs and effectors. Future studies will
        test the potential of sα 
        i2 , when co-expressed with βγ, to
        productively interact with receptors and effectors.
        However, this possibility is viewed as unlikely for several
        reasons. First, others have shown that in COS-7 cells
        endogenous sα 
        i2 is not detected at PM but only found
        intracellularly [ 3 4 ] , although one cannot rule out that
        a small but functionally significant fraction of sα 
        i2 reaches the PM. Second, the extreme
        C-termini of Gα are critical sites for interaction with
        GPCRs [ 32 ] , and the novel C-terminal sequence found in
        sα 
        i2 would be predicted to disrupt
        productive interactions with GPCRs. Third, even though βγ
        can promote PM localization of sα 
        i2 in the overexpression system
        described here, sα 
        i2 remains less stable than α 
        i2 (Figure 9), suggesting that such
        instability may also impair productive interactions with
        GPCRs.
        On the other hand, unknown protein(s) may function to
        stabilize sα 
        i2 and help direct it to Golgi
        membranes. A specific combination of β and γ subtypes may
        play such a role; however, one thorough study showed a lack
        of βγ on Golgi membranes of exocrine pancreatic cells even
        though a variety of Gα were readily detected in the Golgi [
        33 ] . Other proteins that may specifically promote the
        intracellular targeting of Gα have not been identified.
        It is possible that sα 
        i2 functions as a short-lived protein
        regulating some aspect of membrane transport pathways;
        however, no experiments to directly support or refute this
        hypothesis have been reported. Instead, it is tempting to
        speculate that alternative splicing may be a mechanism to
        regulate cellular levels of α 
        i2 . In this model, certain conditions
        may favor the formation of sα 
        i2 compared to α 
        i2 , and the resulting rapid degradation
        of sα 
        i2 would decrease the cellular content
        of α 
        i2 . A precedent for such alternative
        splicing-dependent regulation of expression has been
        described for H-ras [ 34 ] . Alternative splicing occurs in
        H-ras, and the alternative spliced form is predicted to
        encode an unstable transcript and a protein product that
        lacks the ability to oncogenically transform cells. A
        mutation was identified that abolishes the alternatively
        spliced form, and this mutation leads to an increase in
        H-ras expression and transforming ability. Thus, it was
        demonstrated that alternative splicing is a mechanism that
        cells use to control expression of H-ras [ 34 ] .
        Alternative splicing may similarly play an important role
        in regulating expression of α 
        i2 . Testing of this idea will require a
        comparison of sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 transcript levels, and an analysis of
        whether relative expression is affected in response to
        physiological changes, such as extracellular stimuli or
        cell differentiation.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, the results presented here demonstrate that
        sα 
        i2 , a novel splice variant of α 
        i2 , is rapidly degraded when expressed
        in cells. Such instability is consistent with known
        structure-function data regarding the importance of the
        C-terminus of Gα subunits. The observed intracellular
        localization of sα 
        i2 is due, at least in part, to its
        instability. Moreover, the data presented in this study
        argue against the novel C-terminus of sα 
        i2 functioning as a specific Golgi
        targeting motif.
        In addition, similarly to sα 
        i2 , an α 
        i2 mutant, α 
        i2 A327S, previously demonstrated to be
        unstable 
        in vitro , displays a defect in
        plasma membrane localization when expressed in cells. These
        results suggest that both sα 
        i2 and α 
        i2 A327S may prove valuable in future
        studies of mechanisms of degradation of Gα.

          Cell culture reagents were obtained from Mediatech.
          [9,10- 3H]palmitic acid, [9,10- 3H]myristic acid, and 35S
          Express labeling mix were from NEN.
          Acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN) and MG-132 were
          from Calbiochem. The EE monoclonal antibody was a gift
          from H. Bourne. Other reagents were obtained from Fisher
          and Sigma.
        
        
          Expression plasmids
          EE-α 
          i2 -pcDNAI was obtained from H. Bourne
          (UCSF). In this plasmid, mouse α 
          i2 cDNA contains the EE epitope
          sequence EEYMPTE at codons 166 to 172 [ 11 ] . Mouse sα 
          i2 cDNA was provided by E. Borrelli
          (Strasbourg) in the plasmid pSVsGi2. sα 
          i2 was excised from pSVsGi2 using
          EcoRI and SmaI and subcloned into the EcoRI and EcoRV
          sites of pcDNAI to produce sα 
          i2 -pcDNAI. EE-tagged sα 
          i2 was constructed by subcloning a
          EcoRI-BglII fragment from EE-α 
          i2 -pcDNAI into sα 
          i2 -pcDNAI. EE-tagged α 
          i2 A327S-pcDNAI was obtained from J.
          Morales (UCSF). EE-tagged α 
          i2 (1-331)-pcDNA3 was constructed by
          by PCR amplification of the coding region for the amino
          acids 1 to 331 of α 
          i2 using the T7 primer as the 5'
          primer and 5'-ccggctcgagtcacttggtgtcggtggcgcatg-3' as the
          3' primer and using EE-α 
          i2 -pcDNA3 as the template. The PCR
          amplified product was digested with HindIII and XhoI and
          subcloned into the correspondingly digested EE-α 
          i2 -pcDNA3. GFP-sα 
          i2 35aa was constructed by PCR
          amplification of the coding region for the C-terminal 35
          amino acids of sα 
          i2 using the 5' primer
          5'-cgcagatctagaaaactttttaga-3' and the 3' primer
          5'-cgcaagcttactcaaggcacggaatc-3'. The PCR fragment was
          digested with BglII and HindIII and subcloned into the
          correspondingly digested pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). α 
          i2 (1-10)-GFP was constructed by
          annealing the complementary oligonucleotides
          5'-ctagcaccatgggctgcaccgtgtcggccgaggacaag-3' and
          5'-ccggcttgtcctcggacacggtgcagcccatggtg-3' (corresponding
          to amino acids 1-10 of α 
          i2 ) and ligating into AgeI-NheI
          digested pEGFP-N1. Human β 
          1 -pCMV5 and bovine γ 
          2 -pcDNAI have been described [ 35 ]
          .
        
        
          Cell culture and transfection
          BHK, HEK293, and COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM
          containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were
          performed in 6-well plates or 6 cm culture dishes using
          Lipofectamine (GibcoBRL) or FuGene6 (Roche) according to
          the manufacturer's protocol.
        
        
          Immunofluorescence localization
          Cells were transfected in 6-well plates with 1 μg of
          the indicated expression plasmid. In experiments where β 
          1 and γ 
          2 expression plasmids were
          co-transfected with α 
          i2 or sα 
          i2 , the amounts of α, β, and γ
          plasmids used were 0.7, 0.2, and 0.1 μg, respectively. 24
          h after transfection, cells were replated onto glass
          coverslips and grown for an additional 24 h before fixing
          in methanol at -20°C for 20 min. Cells were washed with
          PBS and then incubated in blocking buffer consisting of
          TBS (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) with 1% Triton
          X-100 and 2.5% nonfat milk. Coverslips were then
          incubated in blocking buffer containing 20 μg/ml EE
          monoclonal antibody for 1 h. For dual localization
          experiments, a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal
          anti-β-coatomer protein (β-COP) antibody (Affinity
          BioReagents) or a 1:200 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal
          anti-protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) antibody
          (StressGen Biotechnologies) was included with the EE
          mouse monoclonal. Following washes with blocking buffer,
          cells were incubated in a 1:100 dilution of the indicated
          secondary antibody, either Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 goat
          anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) or Texas Red donkey
          anti-mouse (Jackson Immunoresearch) or Alexa Fluor 488
          goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes), for 30 min. The
          coverslips were washed and mounted on glass slides with
          Prolong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR),
          and microscopy was performed with an Olympus BX60
          microscope equipped with a Sony DKC-5000 digital camera.
          A minimum of 50 cells were examined for each
          transfection. Transfections were repeated and
          representative pictures were taken of cells displaying a
          typical expression pattern for each transfection. Only
          cells displaying low to intermediate levels of expression
          were utilized. Images were processed with Adobe
          Photoshop.
        
        
          Subcellular Fractionation
          Soluble and particulate fractions were isolated as
          previously described [ 29 ] . BHK or COS-7 cells were
          transfected in 6 cm plates with 3 μg of the indicated
          expression plasmid. 24 h after transfection, the cells
          were transferred to 10-cm plates and grown for another 24
          h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and
          then lysed in 0.5 ml hypotonic lysis buffer by 10
          passages through a 27-gauge needle. Cells were
          centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min to pellet nuclei and
          intact cells, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at
          150,000 × g for 20 min to obtain soluble and particulate
          fractions. Fractions were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE,
          transferred onto PVDF-Plus (Micron Separations, Inc) and
          probed with EE monoclonal antibody. Bands were visualized
          by chemiluminescence.
        
        
          Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation
          COS-7 cells were transfected in 6 cm plates with 3 μg
          of the indicated expression plasmid. 24 h after
          transfection, cells were replated into 6 cm plates. For
          fatty acid labeling experiments [ 36 ] , one transfection
          was replated into two 6 cm plates. For 35S labeling
          experiments, cells from two or three identical
          transfections were combined before replating in multiple
          6 cm plates. Incubation with radioisotope was then
          performed 48 h after transfection.
          For fatty acid labeling, cells in a 6 cm dish were
          incubated with 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% dialyzed fetal
          bovine serum, 5 mM sodium pyruvate, and [9,10-
          3H]palmitic acid (1 mCi/ml) or [9,10- 3H]myristate (0.5
          mCi/ml) for 2 h. For 35S pulse-chase labeling, cells in a
          6 cm dish were washed with DMEM (without methionine), and
          then incubated in DMEM (without methionine) containing
          10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum at 37°C for 1 h. Next,
          cells were incubated in DMEM (without methionine)
          containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 0.1 mCi/ml
          35S Express mix for 10 min. After the 10 min pulse
          labeling, cells were either immediately lysed (see below)
          or washed with normal growth media and then "chased" by
          incubation in normal growth media for the indicated
          times.
          Fatty acid labeled and 35S methionine/cysteine labeled
          samples were then identically processed by
          immunoprecipitation. Cells were washed once with ice-cold
          PBS and lysed in 1 ml of Extraction buffer (50 mM HEPES,
          pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 10 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton
          X-100, 1% sodium cholate, 1 mM PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin,
          and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell extracts were tumbled for 1
          h at 4°C, and nuclei and insoluble material were removed
          by microcentrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 min. Samples
          were adjusted to 0.5% SDS. 10 μg of EE antibody was
          added, and the samples were tumbled for 2 h at 4°C. Next,
          20 μl of Protein A/G PLUS agarose (Santa Cruz
          Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and the sample
          was tumbled overnight at 4°C. The sample was centrifuged
          for 30 s at 200 × g to pellet the beads. The supernatant
          was discarded, and the beads were washed 3 times with 1
          ml Extraction buffer. SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing
          10 mM DTT was added to the washed beads, and the samples
          were heated at 65°C for 1 min ( 3H fatty acid labeled
          samples) or boiled for 5 min ( 35S methionine/cysteine
          labeled samples). An aliquot was analyzed by 10%
          SDS-PAGE. Gels were incubated for 20 min in an aqueous
          solution of 50% methanol/10% acetic acid, followed by 10%
          ethanol/10% acetic acid for 20 min, and, finally, Amplify
          (Amersham) for 20 min. Gels were dried and subjected to
          fluorography at -80°C using Hyperfilm MP (Amersham). For
          35S pulse-chase experiments, intensity of each labeled
          band was quantitated by densitometry. Results were
          analyzed with GraphPad Prizm software to determine a
          half-life.
