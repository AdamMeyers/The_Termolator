        The actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic system composed of
        actin filaments, proteins that regulate filament dynamics,
        and proteins that remodel and make use of the cytoskeletal
        network. An important aspect of actin cytoskeletal research
        has been the use of small molecules that affect actin
        dynamics and proteins that act on the cytoskeleton [ 1 ] .
        2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) is a small molecule that
        inhibits the ATPase activity of muscle myosinII and reduces
        the force generated by this motor protein [ 2 3 ] . BDM was
        introduced to the cell biology community as a millimolar
        inhibitor of multiple non-muscle myosins with greatest
        potency in inhibiting non-muscle myosinII [ 4 ] . It was
        subsequently used, in concert with other approaches, to
        study nm-myosinII function in a variety of biological
        processes [ 5 6 7 8 ] . BDM was recently shown not to
        inhibit any non-muscle myosins so far tested, leaving the
        question of how it affects cells unanswered [ 9 10 ] .
        One process inhibited by BDM is the centripetal flow of
        actin from the leading edge into the cell body, known as
        retrograde flow [ 11 12 ] . Retrograde flow is thought to
        be driven by a "push-pull" mechanism of polymerization of
        actin at the leading edge of the cell and contractile
        activity of myosin motor proteins [ 13 14 ] . Formation of
        new actin filaments is predominantly mediated by the
        nucleation activity of the Arp2/3 complex [ 15 ] . Members
        of the WASP/WAVE family of proteins, among others,
        stimulate and regulate the Arp2/3 complex for spatial and
        temporal control of filament nucleation [ 15 ] .
        Localization of these proteins to the leading edge, though
        not completely understood, is probably mediated through
        their interactions with the actin cytoskeleton itself and
        membrane-associated binding partners [ 15 16 ] .
        Inhibition of retrograde flow by BDM has been used as
        evidence for the role of nm-myosins in retrograde flow [ 12
        ] . Though not explicitly stated, the localization and
        importance of nm-myosinII in multiple cell types, and the
        fact that BDM was thought to have greatest potency in
        inhibiting nm-myosinII has led most to look at BDM's effect
        on retrograde flow as a result of inhibiting this protein.
        [ 11 17 18 ] . A role for nm-myosinII may exist, given its
        localization and that other perturbations that affect
        myosin function - myosin S1 microinjection, ML-7 treatment,
        and expression of dominant negative nm-myosinII constructs
        and have similar effects to BDM treatment [ 5 7 12 ] .
        However, a study in chick dorsal root ganglia neurons where
        nm-myosinII was inactivated using chromophore assisted
        laser inactivation saw no effect on retrograde flow rates [
        19 ] . We know now that BDM does not in fact inhibit
        nm-myosinII. So, is this effect that we see with BDM
        mediated by other proteins involved in retrograde flow? And
        what can this tell us about the mechanism of retrograde
        flow? How similar is this process to other actin mediated
        processes that use these same proteins, such as Listeria
        motility? BDM has a clear effect on a number of cell
        biological processes. Understanding how these effects are
        mediated can help us learn from BDM and reinterpret
        experiments that made use of it, while working to find new
        and better inhibitors.
      
      
        Results
        
          BDM inhibits actin incorporation in mammalian
          cells
          BDM has been reported to not inhibit nm-myosinII
          ATPase activity [ 9 ] . We show data [Figure 1A] that
          supports this report. The ATPase activity of platelet
          nm-myosinII S1 fragment, is not inhibited by BDM while
          the inhibitor, blebbistatin, decreases ATPase activity by
          more than 90%. The stimulation of ATPase activity by BDM
          [Figure 1A] is similar to a ~2 fold increase seen
          previously (A. Straight personal communication).
          Though BDM does not inhibit nm-myosinII, in
          permeabilized yeast ( 
          S. cerviseae ) BDM has been shown
          to decrease incorporation of exogenous actin into the
          cytoskeleton [ 20 ] . This process of actin incorporation
          requires proteins involved in actin filament formation
          and proteins that may localize a nucleation complex [ 20
          21 ] . To determine if BDM has a similar effect on actin
          incorporation in mammalian cells, and if so an effect on
          actin nucleation, spreading Swiss3T3 cells were treated
          briefly with a media control or 15 mM BDM and then
          permeabilized with the detergent saponin in the presence
          of fluorescently labeled actin. The cells were then fixed
          and incorporation of exogenous actin was determined by
          fluorescence microscopy [ 22 ] . Control cells show
          fluorescent incorporation at the periphery, or leading
          edge, of the cell [Figure 1B]. Treatment of cells with 15
          mM BDM for one minute blocked incorporation at the
          leading edge, as seen by the lack of fluorescence
          intensity, without significant effects on cell morphology
          [Figure 1B]. Cells that remained flat and were not
          disrupted by the permeabilization process were counted,
          and more than 75% (3 trials) showed decreased
          fluorescence similar to that seen in Figure 1B(cells that
          showed significant perturbation by the permeabilization
          process did not show greater actin incorporation).
          Incubation in BDM for longer than 1 minute caused more
          pronounced morphological change upon permeabilization,
          and one-minute treatment was used for subsequent
          experiments.
          As a control, cytochalasin D, a small molecule that
          inhibits actin dynamics by capping the growing ends of
          actin filaments, was added to cells. If added prior to
          permeabilization but not during, exogenous actin was
          still able to incorporate into permeabilized cells and
          fluorescence incorporation was high, similar to control
          cells [Figure 1]. As cytochalasin D has a high affinity
          (50 nM) for the growing ends of actin filaments, this
          treatment should inhibit polymerization of existing
          filaments but should not block new filament formation [
          23 ] . Thus the actin incorporated most likely reflects
          nucleation of new filaments, as previously discussed [ 24
          ] . As expected, cells treated with cytochalasin D during
          permeabilization showed no actin incorporation (data not
          shown).
          To determine if BDM was affecting actin dynamics
          directly, we assayed its ability to inhibit 
          in vitro actin assembly. No effect
          was seen on the polymerization of actin alone or as
          stimulated by VCA-activated Arp2/3 complex, using a
          pyrene-actin polymerization assay (data not shown). This
          result was supported by the observation that 
          Listeria monocytogenes continue to
          move intracellularly, as described below.
        
        
          Arp3 is no longer localized at the leading edge
          with BDM treatment
          Since actin incorporation is not due to elongation of
          existing filaments and BDM does not affect pure actin
          dynamics in vitro, we examined the localization of Arp3,
          a subunit of the actin nucleation Arp2/3 complex. In
          spreading Swiss3T3 cells and spread BS-C-1 cells, Arp3
          localized to the leading edge of the cell. However, after
          treatment with 20 mM BDM for one minute, localization was
          lost in over 90% of the cells [Figure 2A]. Results for
          BS-C-1 and Swiss3T3 cells lines were equivalent and the
          results from BS-C-1 cells are shown here, as they are
          used in subsequent time-lapse experiments. Consistent
          with the inhibition of actin polymerization in the
          permeabilized cell assay, cells treated with BDM do not
          show a brightly staining actin network at the leading
          edge [Figure 2A,2B]. Titration of BDM down to 10 mM
          showed the same loss of localization; however, 2 minutes
          of treatment was required to see equivalent loss (data
          not shown). To control for possible osmotic effects of
          BDM treatment, we treated cells with 20 mM urea, and as
          with a media control, more than 90% of the cells showed
          localization of Arp3 at the leading edge.
          To determine if inhibition of actin dynamics alone was
          sufficient for the loss of Arp3 localization, we treated
          cells with cytochalasin D and examined the localization
          of Arp3. Within one minute at 1 uM cytochalasin D, cell
          ruffling ceased, yet Arp3 remained at the leading edge
          [Figure 2A]. In fact, Arp3 staining at the leading edge
          was consistently higher. Combining cytochalasin D and
          BDM, we saw localization equivalent to or greater than no
          drug treatment [Figure 2A]. Thus, actin dynamics may be
          required for the loss of Arp3 at the leading edge upon
          BDM treatment.
          As mentioned, 
          Listeria infected cells were used
          to confirm that BDM does not directly affect actin
          dynamics. 
          Listeria exploit cellular - actin
          polymerization and organization - proteins to move
          intracellularly. We found that 20 mM BDM does not affect
          movement of bacteria inside treated cells [Figure 3A]
          consistent with a previous report [ 4 ] . Interestingly,
          localization of Arp3 in 
          Listeria comet tails is unaffected
          with BDM treatment [Figure 3B] though Arp3 localization
          at the leading edge of these cells is disrupted.
        
        
          VASP and WAVE are no longer localized to the
          leading edge with BDM treatment
          To ask whether the loss of leading edge localization
          was specific to the Arp complex, we examined the
          localization of VASP and WAVE1 with BDM treatment. Both
          VASP and WAVE function in controlling actin dynamics at
          the leading edge - VASP is thought to promote filament
          elongation, and WAVE, actin nucleation [ 25 26 ] . Both
          VASP and WAVE1 were de-localized from the leading edge
          after 1 min of BDM treatment [Figure 4]. Similar to Arp3,
          the localization of these proteins was not disrupted by
          cytochalasin D treatment, or by the combination of
          cytochalasin D and BDM [Figure 4].
        
        
          Dynamics of the loss of Arp-3 localization
          Two possible mechanisms for Arp2/3 complex
          de-localization were considered: Arp2/3 could move back
          from the leading edge with retrograde flow of actin and
          then be lost from the filaments, or it could simply
          diffuse from the leading edge. To determine the dynamics
          of loss of Arp2/3 complex localization, we generated a
          stable cell line expressing Arp3-GFP. After BDM
          treatment, we observed a uniform decrease in fluorescence
          suggestive of dissociation and diffusion of Arp3, rather
          than de-localization driven by retrograde flow [Figure
          5A]. A linescan of the leading edge shown in Figure 5A,
          plotted across time shows the pattern and extent of loss
          of fluorescence signal [Figure 5B]. Fluorescence levels
          decrease gradually with little or no shift in the peak of
          fluorescence backward. By two minutes, fluorescence
          levels at the leading edge are equivalent to background.
          After washout of BDM, Arp3-GFP localization returns in
          just over one minute. In all cases, the loss of Arp3-GFP
          at the leading edge was seen concomitantly with loss of
          ruffling and retraction of the leading edge or as
          de-localization with slight retraction. We did not see
          retrograde flow of the Arp3 signal in an otherwise stable
          leading edge.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        BDM has been used to probe actin-dependent processes on
        the assumption that it is a specific inhibitor of mysosins.
        BDM has recently been found not to inhibit the 
        in vitro ATPase activity of human
        platelet nm-myosinII, Acanthamoeba myosinIc, human myoIe,
        chicken myosinV, and porcine myosinVI, though it does
        inhibit rabbit muscle myosinII [ 9 10 ] . Thus the
        literature's interpretations of BDM's effects are probably
        incorrect. Our results suggest that the effects of BDM on
        actin-dependent processes such as cell motility and
        retrograde flow may result from effects on proteins
        involved in actin polymerization and the leading edge actin
        itself. It is not clear if these effects on leading edge
        components are direct or indirect. The loss of actin
        polymerization machinery, however, is a previously
        un-described effect of BDM treatment and this highlights
        the importance of defining the localization of proteins
        involved in actin dynamics when leading edge activity is
        disrupted.
        BDM application leads to the loss of localization of
        leading edge components involved in actin nucleation. We
        observe that within two minutes, application of BDM leads
        to the de-localization of the leading edge components -
        Arp3, VASP, and WAVE - and this is concurrent with the loss
        of the actin network at the leading edge. Our data suggest
        a mechanism of de-localization of Arp3 consistent with
        dissociation or diffusion rather than retrograde flow. We
        cannot determine the causal relationship between loss of
        leading edge components and loss of the leading edge actin
        network itself. At the least, the two occur
        simultaneously.
        Interestingly, 
        Listeria bacteria continue to move in
        the presence of BDM, while the leading edge of the infected
        cell stops ruffling. Both processes have been shown to
        involve the Arp2/3 complex. That BDM inhibits one actin
        dependent process but not the other, may be an interesting
        difference in the location of polymerization within the
        cell - actin polymerization at the leading edge vs. the
        cell body, or a difference in the mechanism of actin
        polymerization - the leading edge vs. a 
        Listeria bacterium. BDM treatment
        thus seems to disrupt actin dynamics specific to the plasma
        membrane and this may provide a clue to both the mechanism
        of BDM inhibition and the relationship of actin dynamics at
        the plasma membrane.
        Current understanding of the retrograde flow of actin
        has been influenced by the use of BDM in the sea urchin
        coelomocyte and 
        Aplysia bag cell neuron systems. Our
        data are consistent with results in sea urchin coelomocytes
        where BDM phenocopies the effect of cytochalasin D,
        blocking retrograde flow at the leading edge with continued
        contraction of the actin network causing a clearing of
        actin at the leading edge [ 11 ] . In the coelomyocte
        system, de-localization of leading edge components by BDM
        could account for the inhibition of actin polymerization
        and clearing. In the 
        Aplysia bag cell neuron, BDM
        application leads to extension of filopodia and the growth
        cone itself. Filopodial extension was interpreted as
        supporting the clutch model, with myosins pulling filaments
        toward the growth cone interior. When the myosin activity
        was blocked with BDM treatment, continued actin
        polymerization, thought to occur as elongation of existing
        filaments, lead to protrusion [ 12 27 28 ] . Our
        observation of BDM activity suggests an alternative
        explanation. Perhaps components required for nucleation are
        de-localized by BDM allowing new polymerization to be
        re-directed to filopodia, as filopodial extension is
        thought to be driven by elongation and not nucleation [ 27
        ] . The extension of the growth cone itself could result
        from a similar diversion of actin monomer from nucleation
        of new filaments to extension of existing filaments.
        Treatment of cells with BDM often leads to filopodia-like
        projections as seen in Figure 1Band Figure 2B. Data from
        studies of 
        in vivo and 
        in vitro filopodia formation suggest
        that they develop as a reorganization of the dendritic
        network in which they exist [ 29 30 ] . In the presence of
        proteins that bundle and reorganize actin filaments into
        filopodial precursors, the de-localization of Arp2/3 and
        other leading edge components may lead to the formation of
        filopodia, which are then elongated as described above.
        Future studies will hopefully clarify the role of actin
        nucleation in the 
        Aplysia system or alternative
        mechanisms that would reconcile the discrepancies between
        systems.
        In all systems, a better understanding of how the
        leading edge is constructed and maintained will require
        specific and detailed descriptions of the activity and
        localization of the proteins involved. Membrane ruffling,
        often used as a measure of actin dynamics at the leading
        edge, is a very crude readout. The sensitivity of the
        leading edge is demonstrated by the observation that DMSO
        treatment at a concentration of 1% causes temporary
        inhibition of ruffling and concomitant Arp3 de-localization
        (Yarrow unpublished results). Experimental approaches that
        may help address how such a dynamic and sensitive structure
        is established and maintained include combining inhibition
        of actin dynamics with the use of tools that affect Arp2/3
        or myosin activity or localization, in specific ways.
        Though preliminary, we have seen that Arp3 is still
        localized in the presence of latrunculin A and
        jasplakinolide, and that this localization is lost with BDM
        treatment unlike the combination of cytochalasin D and BDM
        (Yarrow unpublished results). These results may in the end
        tell us more about our understanding of what latrunculin A
        and jasplakinolide do 
        in vivo than the leading edge itself.
        Regardless, this type of experiment awaits more specific
        tools than BDM for follow up.
        Though BDM has a relatively high effective concentration
        (in the millimolar range), it was widely adopted by the
        cell biology community because of its rapid and reversible
        effect on cell behaviour. BDM has not been exhaustively
        tested on all myosins, and a myosin target is not
        unreasonable given findings in Acanthomoeba and 
        S. cerviseae though it does not
        inhibit Acanthamoeba myosinIc or human myoIe 
        in vitro [ 10 20 21 31 ] .
        Regardless, we and others have shown that BDM is not the
        tool that should be used to investigate these behaviours.
        The small molecule approach continues to be an effective
        means to develop tools for understanding cell biological
        process when used and interpreted appropriately. One new
        compound that will help clarify the role of nm-myosinII is
        blebbistatin [ 32 ] . Other small molecules wait to be
        found and experiments using them will continuously refine
        our understanding of the leading edge and the mechanism of
        action of these compounds.
      
      
        Conclusions
        De-localization of actin leading edge components by BDM
        treatment is a newly described effect of this compound. It
        may explain results previously ascribed to inhibition of
        non-muscle myosinII by BDM, particularly in retrograde flow
        studies. Though this effect of BDM is intriguing, future
        studies that look at the establishment and maintenance of
        the actin leading edge should use more potent and specific
        inhibitors.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Platelet myosinII ATPase assay
          The assay was performed using an EnzCheck phosphate
          release assay (Molecular Probes). Platelet myosinII S1
          was diluted to 0.050 mg/ml in reaction buffer (0.2 M KCl,
          10 mM Tris pH 7.0, 10 mM CaCl 
          2 , 2 mM MgCl 
          2 , 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM
          2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methyl purine riboside (MESG) in the
          presence of 1 U purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)).
          DMSO, 20 mM BDM, or 100 uM blebbistatin was added to the
          reactions with a constant DMSO concentration of 1%. ATP
          (100 uM) was added to initiate the reaction and
          absorbance at 360 nm was read every ~6 seconds for 20
          minutes. BDM showed no effect on ATP hydrolysis in the
          absence of myosin.
        
        
          Tissue Culture
          BS-C-1 cells and Swiss3T3 cells were acquired from the
          ATCC (CCL-26, CCL-92). Cells were maintained in
          Dulbecco's Modified Essential Medium with 4.5 g/L
          glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, and
          penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37°C
          with 5% CO 
          2 .
        
        
          Permeabilized cell assay
          Permeabilized cell assays were performed in flow
          chambers as previously described [ 22 ] . Swiss3T3 cells
          were flowed into the chamber, the chamber inverted, and
          cells allowed to spread for 30-45 minutes in a humidified
          environment at 37°C, 5% CO 
          2 . The assay was performed by adding
          50 ul of the warmed sample solution to the chamber while
          wicking with Whatman paper. Cells were rinsed with PBS,
          treated with compounds or media for 1 min, permeabilized
          in the presence or absence of compound for 3 min with
          permeabilization buffer (0.02 g/ml of saponin, 20 mM
          HEPES (pH 7.5), 138 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl 
          2 , 3 mM ETGA, 1 mM DTT + protease
          inhibitors, 0.4 uM rhodamine actin, 1 mM ATP), and fixed
          in PBS + 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min.
        
        
          Listeria infection
          
          Listeria monocytogenes (strain
          10403S) were grown overnight in 3 mls of Brain Heart
          Infusion media at room temp without shaking. BS-C-1 cells
          on 25 mm poly-L-lysine (PLL) coverslips were rinsed with
          media containing no antibiotics and placed in a 6 well
          plate. 
          Listeria were prepared by removing
          1 ml of the overnight culture, pelleting by a 1 min
          Eppendorf centrifuge spin, washing the pellet twice with
          antibiotic-free media, and resuspending in 1 ml of media.
          10 ul of Listeria were added to each well and were
          allowed to infect for 1.5 hrs prior to the addition of
          media containing 50 ug/ml Gentamicin. Cells were imaged
          between 4 hrs and 12 hrs later.
        
        
          Compound treatment for immunofluorescence
          Cells were allowed to spread on 18 mm round PLL
          coverslips in a 12 well plate for 30-45 minutes or 2-4
          hours prior to treatment. BDM (Calbiochem 203984) stock
          solution was made in media at 0.5 M and Cytochalasin D
          (Sigma C8273) in DMSO at 20 mM. With the plate on a 37°C
          heat block, appropriately diluted concentrations of each
          compound (15 or 20 mM BDM, 1 uM cytochalasin D) were made
          in warmed media and added to cells after removal of
          existing media. After 1 minute, the cells were fixed for
          immunoflourescence as described below.
        
        
          Immunofluorescence
          Cells were fixed in a permeabilization/fixation buffer
          (100 mM K-Pipes pH 6.8, 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCL2, 0.2%
          TritonX-100, 3.7% formaldehyde) for 10 minutes. For Arp3
          immunofluorescence, cells were post-fixed in methanol
          (-20°C) for 2 minutes. Coverslips were rinsed with TBS
          containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBS-Tx) and blocked in
          TBS-Tx with 2% BSA (AbDil) for 45 minutes. Antibodies
          were diluted in AbDil and incubated for 45 minutes.
          Coverslips were rinsed in TBS-Tx and incubated with
          fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies in TBS-Tx for
          45 minutes. Coverslips were rinsed and mounted in 90%
          glycerol with 0.5% p-phenylenediamine in 20 mM Tris-pH
          8.8.
          Antibodies used: rabbit Arp3 antibodies (gift from C.
          Egile using the same peptide as described [ 33 ] ) used
          at 1:500 dilution, mouse actin antibodies (Santa Cruz
          SC-8432) used at 1:10,000 dilution, rabbit VASP
          antibodies (gift from F. Southwick) used at 1:100, rabbit
          WAVE1 antibodies (gift from S. Eden as described [ 26 ] )
          used at 1:100 and Alexa-dye labeled secondary antibodies,
          goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse (Molecular
          Probes).
        
        
          GFP-Arp3 cell line
          A stable BS-C-1 cell line was made by transfection of
          GFP-Arp3 (gift from D. Schafer as described [ 34 ] )
          using Fugene6 (Roche) and selection with 500 ug/ml
          Geneticin. GFP expressing colonies were picked and
          expanded.
        
        
          Live imaging of GFP-Arp3
          GFP-Arp3 cells were split onto 25 mm PLL coated
          coverslips 4-6 hrs before imaging. Cells were transferred
          to Liebovitz L-15 media with 10% fetal calf serum in a
          heated (37°C) open-air chamber 15 minutes prior to
          imaging. Images were captured on a Nikon TE300 inverted
          microscope with appropriate neutral density filtering
          using an Apo 100 × /1.4 NA oil emersion phase objective
          and captured on a CCD camera (Hammamatsu-OrcaER) using
          Metamorph software. Images were taken every 15 s with an
          exposure of 200-1000 ms.
