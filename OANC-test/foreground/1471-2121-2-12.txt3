        The p53 tumor suppressor gene is activated during
        several cellular processes. These include DNA damage caused
        by Ionizing Radiation and genotoxic agents [ 1], by
        expression of activated oncogenes such as ras or myc [ 2],
        or during progression of primary cells to senescence [ 3].
        The activation of p53 by these diverse stimuli can initiate
        either growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the cellular
        context [ 1, 2, 3]. p53 posses sequence-specific DNA
        binding activity and functions in the cell as a
        transcriptional regulator. Many p53 regulated genes have
        been identified [ 3, 4, 5], and the majority of the
        cellular effects of p53 activation can be attributed to the
        activation of these p53 target genes.
        The mechanism of p53 activation in response to either
        DNA damage or oncogene expression occurs through
        stabilization of the p53 protein. In unstimulated cells,
        the mdm2 protein binds to the N-terminal transactivation
        domain of p53 and targets it for ubiquitin-dependent
        degradation [ 6, 7]. Activation of p53 requires disruption
        of the mdm2-p53 interaction to allow p53 accumulation in
        the cell. 2 distinct mechanisms for p53 activation have so
        far been elucidated. The expression of oncogenes such as
        ras in untransformed cells stimulates transcription of the
        p14 Arfgene [ 2]. p14 Arfbinds to and sequesters mdm2,
        allowing free p53 protein to accumulate in the cells [ 8].
        Activation of p53 by DNA damage is also brought about by
        inhibition of p53-mdm2 interaction. The product of the
        Ataxia Telangiectasia gene, the ATM protein kinase [ 9],
        directly phosphorylates serine 15 of the p53 protein in
        response to Ionizing Radiation [ 10, 11]. In addition, ATM
        phosphorylates and activates chk2 kinase [ 12]. Activated
        chk2 can then directly phosphorylate serine 20 of p53 [ 13,
        14]. ATM therefore controls the phosphorylation of serines
        15 and 20 of p53. In addition, DNA damage increases the
        phosphorylation of serines 33 and 37 of p53 through an
        ATM-independent mechanism [ 15, 16, 17, 18]. These DNA
        damage-induced phosphorylations of p53 block the binding of
        mdm2 to the N-terminal of the p53 protein [ 18]. Thus
        phosphorylation of the p53 protein in response to DNA
        damage or expression of p14Arf prevents mdm2 binding and
        p53 protein then accumulates in the cell.
        Although stabilization of the p53 protein is the initial
        step in p53 activation, subsequent steps, including
        activation of p53's DNA binding activity and changes in
        p53's transcriptional activity, are also involved. For
        example, p53's DNA binding activity is increased by the DNA
        damage-induced acetylation of the C-terminal of p53 [ 16,
        19], and this acetylation requires the prior
        phosphorylation of the N-terminal of p53 [ 16]. In
        addition, phosphorylation of the N-terminal transactivation
        domain of p53 may be required to stimulate transcriptional
        activation of p53 target genes. Multiple phosphorylation
        sites have been detected in the N-terminal of p53,
        including serines 6, 9, 15, 20, 33, 37 and 46 [ 10, 11, 12,
        13, 14, 20, 21, 22]. While phosphorylation of serines 15
        and 20 of p53 are clearly dependent on the ATM and chk2
        protein kinases [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], the kinases
        responsible for phosphorylation of the remaining serine
        residues 
        in vivo is not clear.
        The activation of p53 by DNA damage or oncogenes such as
        ras results in either growth arrest or apoptosis of the
        affected cell. In this study, we have examined how Glycogen
        Synthase Kinase 3β (GSK3β), a protein kinase involved in
        tumorigenesis, differentiation and apoptosis, regulates the
        function of p53 [ 23, 24]. GSK3β phosphorylates several
        transcription factors, including NFATc and HSF1 [ 24, 25,
        26, 27]. GSK3β is constitutively active in resting cells
        but is inhibited when cells are exposed to growth factors [
        24, 28].
        GSK3 inhibition occurs when the p110-PI 3-kinase/Protein
        Kinase B (PKB) pathway is activated by growth factors [ 23,
        24, 25, 29]. Activated PKB then phosphorylates GSK3β,
        inhibiting GSK3 kinase activity [ 29]. This activation of
        the p110-PI 3-kinase/PKB pathway, and inhibition of GSK3,
        delivers a strong anti-apoptotic signal to the cell [ 23,
        24, 25]. Given the well characterized role of p53 in
        apoptosis [ 3, 4, 5], we examined if GSK3p participates in
        the regulation of the p53 protein.
        GSK3 phosphorylates the consensus sequence
        Ser-X-X-X-Ser(P), where the C-terminal serine residue is
        already phosphorylated [ 24, 28]. Thus GSK3 only
        phosphorylates target proteins which have already been
        phosphorylated by a separate, priming kinase. p53 contains
        5 potential GSK3 phosphorylation sites, 3 in the N-terminal
        transactivation domain and 2 in the C-terminal regulatory
        domain. Here, we show that GSK3β, but not GSK3α, can
        phosphorylate serine 33 of p53 
        in vitro when serine 37 is already
        phosphorylated. Further, GSK3β can increase p53's
        transcriptional activity 
        in vivo, and this activation is lost
        when serine 33 is mutated to alanine.
      
      
        Results
        The p53 protein contains several serine residues which
        are located within potential GSK3 phosphorylation sites.
        Protein kinases which can phosphorylate p53 within these
        predicted GSK3 sites include MAP kinase, Protein Kinase A,
        Protein Kinase C, Casein Kinase II, Jun kinase (JNK) and
        DNA-dependent Protein Kinase (DNA-PK) [ 30, 31, 32, 33, 34,
        35]. These kinases were examined to determine if they can
        act as the priming kinase for either of the 2 isoforms of
        GSK3, GSK3α and GSK3β. The general protocol was to incubate
        purified priming kinases with p53-GST fusion protein and
        ATP for 5 h, then heat inactivate the priming kinase.
        Preliminary experiments indicated that each of the tested
        kinases was able to phosphorylate p53-GST under the
        experimental conditions (data not shown). Aliquots of the
        prephosphorylated p53-GST were then incubated with or
        without recombinant GSK3α or GSK3β and 32P-ATP to measure
        p53 phosphorylation.
        p53-GST preincubated in buffer alone, and then exposed
        to the heat inactivation protocol was not phosphorylated by
        either GSK3α or GSK3β (fig 1, Control). Autophosphorylation
        of GSK3α and GSK3β can be seen (figure 1). Unphosphorylated
        p53-GST is therefore not a substrate for GSK3α or GSK3β 
        in vitro. p53-GST was then
        prephosphorylated with MAP kinase, S6 kinase, Protein
        Kinase A, DNA-PK and Protein Kinase C (fig 1) or Casein
        Kinase II and JNK1/JNK2 (data not shown). Following
        incubation in each of the primary kinases, the
        prephosphorylated p53-GST was then incubated with 32P-ATP
        and either GSK3α or GSK3β. Prephosphorylation of p53-GST by
        MAP kinase, S6 kinase, Protein Kinase A or Protein Kinase C
        (fig 1) or Casein Kinase II or JNK1 or JNK 2 (data not
        shown) failed to create a phosphorylation site for either
        GSK3α or GSK3β. However, prephosphorylation of p53-GST by
        DNA-PK resulted in strong phosphorylation of p53 by GSK3β
        (fig 1) but not GSK3α. GST protein alone incubated with
        DNA-PK was not phosphorylated by GSK3β (data not shown).
        Since there was no significant phosphorylation of p53-GST
        by GSK3α (fig 1), this indicates that phosphorylation of
        p53 by DNA-PK, 
        in vitro, creates a site for GSK3β to
        phosphorylate p53.
        Next, we set out to identify the exact amino-acid(s)
        within the p53 protein which were phosphorylated by GSK3β.
        p53 is phosphorylated by DNA-PK at serines 15 and 37 [ 32].
        Of these 2 sites, the sequence around serine 37 contains a
        predicted GSK3 phosphorylation site at serine 33 (figure 2,
        underlined). Serine 33 and 37 of p53 were individually
        mutated to alanine, and p53-GST fusion proteins containing
        these mutations prepared. The ability of DNA-PK to create a
        GSK3β phosphorylation site on these p53 proteins was then
        examined.
        In the absence of p53, no phosphorylation by GSK3β was
        detected (fig 2). Unphosphorylated p53-GST was not a
        substrate for GSK3β, whereas p53-GST prephosphorylated by
        DNA-PK was (fig 2). Mutation of serine 33 of p53 to alanine
        (S33A) blocked the ability of GSK3β to phosphorylate p53,
        indicating that serine 33 is the likely target for GSK3β
        (fig 2, 33). Similarly, mutation of serine 37, which
        abolishes the DNA-PK phosphorylation site, blocks
        phosphorylation of p53 by GSK3β. This indicates that p53
        must be phosphorylated on serine 37 by DNA-PK before it can
        be phosphorylated at serine 33 by GSK3β.
        To examine the 
        in vivo function of these 
        in vitro phosphorylations, wtp53 and
        p53 with the S33A and S37A mutations were sub-cloned into
        the expression vector pcDNA3.1. These were then expressed
        in the human osteosarcoma cell line SAOS-2, which does not
        express endogenous p53 protein [ 33]. First, we analyzed
        the level of expression of each of the p53 proteins
        following transient expression in SAOS-2 cells. In fig 3A,
        approx equal amounts of wtp53, p53S33A and p53S37A were
        detected by western blot, indicating that they were
        expressed at similar levels. In fig 3B, we examined the
        transcriptional activity of these p53 constructs. A
        p53-reporter construct, p50-2, which specifically responds
        to wtp53 by increasing transcription of the luciferase
        gene, was used [described in 33]. In fig 3B, SAOS-2 cells
        transiently expressing vector (Con), showed minimal
        activation of the p53-reporter construct. Cells expressing
        wtp53 showed significant activation, as did cells
        expressing both the S33A and S37A mutations. Both the S33A
        and S37A mutations displayed slightly higher basal levels
        of transcriptional activity than the wtp53 protein.
        Serines 33 and 37 are located within the N-terminal
        transcriptional activation domain of the p53 protein. To
        determine if GSK3β regulates p53's transcriptional activity
        
        in vivo, a wild type GSK3β expression
        vector was cotransfected with either wtp53 or p53 with
        mutations in serines 33 or 37. The ability of GSK3β to
        activate each construct was calculated by expressing the
        p53 transcriptional activity in the presence of GSK3β as a
        percentage of that observed in the absence of GSK3β. On
        this scale, no activation by GSK3β yields a zero percent
        increase in p53 transcriptional relative to p53 alone.
        GSK3β alone (fig 3C, Con) did not significantly increase
        the activity of the luciferase reporter construct. When
        GSK3β was cotransfected with wtp53, p53-dependent activity
        from the luciferase reporter construct was increased by
        160% compared to wtp53 alone. To determine if this
        activation of p53 transcriptional activity required the
        GSK3β phosphorylation site at serine 33, wtp53 with serine
        to alanine mutations at either positions 33 or 37 were
        cotransfected with GSK3β. Mutation of either serine 33 or
        37 significantly reduced the ability of GSK3β to upregulate
        p53 transcriptional activity. This is consistent with the
        phosphorylation data in fig 1and 2, which indicated that
        serine 37 phosphorylation is required for the subsequent
        phosphorylation of serine 33 by GSK3β. These results
        suggests that GSK3β may be a physiological regulator of the
        p53 protein. GSK3β is constitutively active in resting
        cells, and is inactivated by PKB through the growth factor
        dependent p110-PI 3-kinase pathway [ 25, 28, 29]. Thus the
        activity of GSK3β in growing cells is less than that in
        cells arrested in Go. p53 can be activated by several
        distinct pathways, including DNA damage. If GSK3β is
        involved in the activation of p53 by DNA damage, then GSK3β
        is predicted to be upregulated in response to DNA damage.
        In fig 4, GSK3β kinase activity was monitored by
        immunoprecipitating GSK3β and then measuring the ability of
        the immunoprecipitated protein to phosphorylate a specific
        GSK3β peptide substrate. In fig 4, the omission of either
        the peptide or the GSK3β antibody from the assay resulted
        in minimal phosphorylation of the substrate peptide (fig
        4). When both GSK3β antibody and substrate peptide were
        employed, high levels of GSK3β-dependent kinase activity
        were detected. When cells were incubated for 24 h in low
        serum (0.5%) to induce growth arrest in Go, the levels of
        GSK3β activity were increased compared to asynchronously
        growing cells (fig 4, Go). When asynchronously growing
        cells were exposed to 5Gy or 10Gy of Ionizing Radiation to
        cause DNA damage, the levels of GSK3β activity were
        reduced. Similar results were seen using p53-GST as the
        substrate for GSK3β phosphorylation in the kinase assay
        (data not shown). This implies that the phosphorylation of
        serine 33 of p53 by GSK3β would be decreased in cells
        exposed to DNA damage, but elevated in cells growth
        arrested in Go.
      
      
        Discussion
        Several p53 kinases were examined for their ability to
        create 
        in vitro GSK3 phosphorylation sites
        on p53. Phosphorylation of p53 by DNA-PK created a
        phosphorylation site for GSK3β, but not for GSK3α. GSK3α
        and GSK3β have 98% homology within the kinase domain,
        although regions N- and C-terminal to this are less well
        conserved [ 36]. GSK3α and GSK3β have similar substrate
        specificity 
        in vivo, and are regulated in
        parallel in response to growth factors [ 24, 27, 28, 29].
        However, disruption of GSK3β in mice results in embryonic
        lethality and impaired NFκ B function [ 37], indicating
        that GSK3α cannot substitute for GSK3β in this model
        system. GSK3α and GSK3β therefore have overlapping cellular
        functions, but each isoform also regulates distinct
        signaling pathways. Our results clearly show that p53
        phsophorylation is specific for GSK3β.
        The GSK3β phosphorylation site was identified by
        mutagenesis as serine 33 of p53, and we were able to show
        that this was dependent on prior phosphorylation of serine
        37 by DNA-PK. We also examined if GSK3β regulates 
        in vivo p53 function through a
        mechanism involving serines 33 and 37 of p53. Previous
        studies have shown that phosphorylation of serines 15, 20,
        33 and 37 of p53 block the interaction of p53 with mdm2,
        leading to stabilization and accumulation of p53 protein in
        the cell [ 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18]. mdm2 binding is
        dependent on the phosphorylation status of serine 20 of p53
        [ 15], although phosphorylation of serines 15, 33 and 37
        also play a role. We did not detect any significant
        difference in the level of expression of p53 with single
        mutations in either serines 33 or 37 when compared to
        wtp53, indicating that single point mutations in serines 33
        or 37 do not greatly alter p53 stability.
        A key function of p53 is the transcriptional activation
        of genes which regulate growth arrest and apoptosis [ 1, 2,
        3, 4]. Individual mutation of either serine 33 or 37
        slightly increased the basal transcriptional activity of
        the p53 protein. This is in keeping with observations made
        by other groups, who demonstrated that single or multiple
        mutations in p53 phosphorylation sites has minimal effect
        on the basal transcriptional activity of the p53 protein [
        38, 39, 40]. We also determined if GSK3β could regulate p53
        transcriptional activity 
        in vivo. GSK3β is constitutively
        active in resting cells, but exhibits lower activity in
        asynchronously growing cells [ 24]. To increase the
        activity of GSK3β, we co-transfected GSK3β with either
        wtp53 or p53 bearing serine to alanine mutations at
        positions 33 or 37. GSK3β increased the transcriptional
        activity of wtp53, but not of p53 with mutations in either
        serine 33 or 37. Therefore both serine 33 and serine 37 are
        required for GSK3β to activate p53 transcriptional activity
        
        in vivo. GSK3β regulates many stress
        activated transcription factors. For example, GSK3β is
        required for activation of NFκ B [ 37], but inhibits
        activation of Heat Shock Factor-1 [ 27]. Our results
        indicate that GSK3β may also be involved in the activation
        of the p53 protein as well.
        A key question is whether DNA-PK or some other kinase
        phosphorylates serine 37 of p53 
        in vivo. DNA-PK is 460 kd
        DNA-activated protein kinase which participates in the
        cellular response to DNA damage [ 41]. DNA-PK is involved
        in DNA strand-break repair, and can phosphorylate serines
        15 and serine 37 of p53 
        in vitro [ 32]. Some reports indicate
        that DNA-PK is required for the activation of p53 [ 42],
        but recent genetic studies have shown clearly that DNA-PK
        is not required for p53 activation by Ionizing Radiation [
        43]. Whether DNA-PK is required for p53 activation in
        response to other stimuli is not known. A more likely
        candidate is the Atr protein kinase, a kinase related to
        DNA-PK [ 44], which can regulate the phosphorylation of
        serine 37 of p53 in response to DNA damage. The present
        data indicates that transcriptional activation of p53 by
        GSK3β requires both serines 33 and 37, but it does not
        allow us to determine if phosphorylation of serine 33 is
        dependent on phosphorylation of serine 37 
        in vivo. It is possible that, 
        in vivo, GSK3β directly
        phosphorylates serine 33 independently of serine 37, but
        that both residues must be phosphorylated for
        transcriptional activation to occur 
        in vivo. Future studies will address
        this issue.
        p53 is activated by multiple pathways, including DNA
        damage and oncogene activation [ 1, 2, 3]. If GSK3β is
        required for the activation of p53 by DNA damage, GSK3β
        activity should be regulated by DNA damage. However, when
        cells were exposed to Ionizing Radiation, GSK3β kinase
        activity was inhibited rather than enhanced, implying
        decreased GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation of p53 after DNA
        damage. Serine 33 of p53 is also phosphorylated by other
        kinases, including the CDK7-cyclin H complex [ 45] and p38
        MAPK [ 46]. p38 MAPK is involved in p53 activation by
        genotoxic stress [ 46], and may be responsible for p53
        phosphorylation at serine 33 in response to DNA damage.
        GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation of p53 at serine 33 may be
        part of other p53-regulatory pathways, such as oncogene
        activation or apoptosis, which are not directly activated
        by DNA-damage. For example, activation of the p110-PI
        3-kinase/PKB pathway delivers an anti-apoptotic signal to
        the cell [ 23, 25, 47]. Further, activation of the p110-PI
        3-kinase/PKB is associated with inhibition of both p53
        dependent apoptosis [ 48] and p53 transcriptional activity
        [ 49, 50]. Although PKB has many down stream targets which
        may regulate these effects [ 47] a key target of PKB is
        GSK3β [ 29]. Phosphorylation of GSK3β by PKB inhibits GSK3β
        kinase activity [ 29]. This would be predicted to block
        phosphorylation of serine 33 of p53 by GSK3β, decreasing
        p53 transcriptional activity and therefore reducing the
        transcription of p53-regulated growth and pro-apoptotic
        proteins. However, clarification of the potential role of
        GSK3β in regulating p53 activation by non-DNA damage
        pathways will require additional study.
      
      
        Conclusions
        This study demonstrates that GSK3β, but not GSK3α, can
        directly phosphorylate serine 33 of p53 when serine 37 of
        p53 is already phosphorylated. GSK3β can increase p53's
        transcriptional activity 
        in vivo, and this activation requires
        serines 33 and 37 of the p53 protein. Thus GSK3β may
        phosphorylate and activate p53 
        in vivo. However, GSK3β is not part
        of the p53-DNA damage response pathway. Instead, GSK3β may
        provide the link between p53 and non-DNA damage mechanisms
        for p53 activation, such as oncogene activation.

          Phosphorylation Reactions
          Wild type p53 or p53 bearing mutations in serines 33
          or 37 were subcloned into pGEX-2T GST fusion vector
          (Pharmacia, NJ) and p53-GST purified as previously
          described [ 33]. p53-GST protein (2 μg; measured using
          Bio-Rad Protein assay Kit, Biorad, CA) was incubated with
          MAP kinase (Erk2, 10 Units, New England Biolabs, MA),
          Protein Kinase A (Catalytic sub-unit, 5 Units,
          Calbiochem, CA), S6 kinase (0.2 Units, Upstate
          Biotechnology, NY), Protein Kinase C (O.1 mUnits, Roche
          Molecular Biochemicals, IN) or DNA-PK (20 Units, Promega
          Corp, Wl) for 5 h at 30°C in the following buffers (40 μl
          final volume). MAP kinase and Protein Kinase A: 20 mM
          Hepes pH 7.2/10 mM Na-Acetate/30 mM MgCl 
          2 /0.2 mM EDTA/1 mM EDTA/I0 μM ATP. S6
          Kinase: 20 mM MOPS pH 7.2/30 mM MgCl 
          2 /5 mM EGTA/1 mM DTT/I0 μM ATP.
          DNA-PK:25 mM Hepes pH7.5/150 mM KCI/10 mM MgCl 
          2 /20% Glycerol/0.1% NP40/20 μM ZnCl 
          2 /1 mM DTT/250 ng DNA/4.2 mM
          spermidine/ 10 μM ATP. PKC: 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4/ 20 mM
          MgCl 
          2 / 0.2 mM EGTA/ 1 mM CaCl 
          2 /1.5 μg phosphatidylserine. Samples
          were then incubated at 65°C for 20 min to inactivate
          kinases, and 25% of the reaction incubated for 30 min
          with GSK3α or GSK3β in GSK3 kinase buffer (KGB Buffer: 8
          mM MOPS, pH7.2/ 10 mM MgCl 
          2 / 0.2 mM EDTA/ 5 μM ATP/10 μCi
          32P-ATP) in a final volume of 40 μl. Reactions were
          terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and
          p53-GST phosphorylation detected by SDS-PAGE and
          auotradiography. Equal amounts of p53-GST (0.25 μg) were
          analyzed by SDS-PAGE and equal loading confirmed by
          coomassie blue staining of the SDS-PAG.
        
        
          GSK3 immunokinase assay
          SAOS-2 cells (5 × 10 6) were lyzed in 0.5 ml of GLB
          buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.5/1 mM EDTA/1 mM EGTA/0.5%
          NP40/0.5 M NaCI/1 mM DTT/1 mM
          PMSF/leupeptin/aprotinin/600 μM Na 
          3 VO 
          4 /50 mM NaF). Extracts were cleared
          by centrifugation and incubated with GSK3 antibody (1 μg;
          Upstate Biotech, NY) prebound to Sepharose A/G agarose
          beads for 2 h. The beads were washed in 4 × 1 ml of GLB
          buffer and then in 2 × 1 ml of KGB buffer. Kinase
          reactions contained 5 μM ATP/15 μCi 32P-ATP/0.5 μg
          PhosphoCREB peptide in 30 μl of KGB. After incubate for
          10 min at room temperature, the beads were collected by
          centrifugation and 20 μl of the reaction mix spotted onto
          circles of P81 paper (Whatman, USA). The P81 paper was
          washed in 4 × 10 ml changes of 100 mM phosphoric acid,
          dried and counted. PhosphoCREB peptide (sequence
          KRREILSRRPS(P)YR) was obtained from New England Biolabs,
          MA.
          
          Mutagenesis was carried out using the
          Altered Sites Mutagenesis System (Promega, Wl) as
          previously described by us [ 33]. Human wild type p53 or
          p53 bearing mutations in serines 33 or 37 were inserted
          into the BamH1 site of the pcDNA3.1 expression vector
          (Invitrogen, CA).
          
          Luciferase reporter assays were
          carried out in the p53 null cell line SAOS-2 using the
          p53 specific luciferase reporter construct p50-Luc, and
          pCMV-β-galatosidase to control for transfection
          efficiency. Cells were transfected using Lipofectin
          (Gibco-BRL) containing p50-Luc (1 μg), pCMV-Gal (1 μg)
          and pcDNAp53 (50 ng) in a final volume of 400 μl as
          described in the manufacturers protocol.
