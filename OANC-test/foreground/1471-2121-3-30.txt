        Arabidopsis seedlings display distinct morphologies when
        grown in the dark compared to the light. Light-grown
        seedlings develop photomorphogenically, characterized by
        short hypocotyls and open green cotyledons. In contrast,
        dark-grown seedlings undergo skotomorphogenesis (or
        etiolation), typified by elongated hypocotols and closed
        cotyledons [ 1 ] . COP1 was first identified through
        genetic screens as a negative regulator of light regulated
        development in Arabidopsis [ 2 ] . Arabidopsis 
        cop1 mutant seedlings are
        constitutively photomorphogenic even when grown in the
        dark, and the severe 
        cop1 mutants cause lethality in the
        late seedling stage, indicating that COP1 is essential for
        plant development [ 2 3 ] . Arabidopsis COP1 (Arabidopsis
        thaliana COP1, AtCOP1) is essential for the
        proteasome-dependent degradation of two transcription
        factors, HY5 and HYH [ 4 5 ] . These two homologous
        bZIP-type transcription factors directly interact with
        AtCOP1 and are capable of binding to light-responsive
        promoters to activate the transcription of many target
        genes [ 5 6 ] . Genome wide micro-array analysis shows that
        AtCOP1 regulates most, if not all, of the light-responsive
        genes under various light conditions [ 7 8 ] ,
        substantiating the notion that AtCOP1 functions as a
        crucial developmental switch through targeting key
        transcription factors for degradation, thereby controlling
        the light-responsive gene expression and photomorphogenic
        development.
        AtCOP1 contains three conserved structural domains: a
        RING finger at the amino terminus, a coiled-coil domain in
        the middle, and a carboxyl-terminal WD40 repeat domain [ 9
        10 ] . Each of the three conserved domains has been shown
        to mediate protein-protein interactions [ 11 12 13 ] . The
        subcellular localization of AtCOP1 is regulated by light in
        a tissue specific manner [ 14 15 ] . The hypocotyl cell
        nuclei contain high levels of COP1 in the dark and reduced
        levels in the light, suggesting that the nucleocytoplasmic
        partitioning of AtCOP1 is adjusted by a light-responsive
        mechanism [ 14 16 ] . The activity of AtCOP1 is at least in
        part regulated by its subcellular localization, as the
        degradation of HY5 is dependent upon the nuclear
        accumulation of AtCOP1 in the dark [ 4 ] . AtCOP1 was
        demonstrated to carry a single, bipartite nuclear
        localization signal located between the coiled-coil domain
        and the WD-40 domain (amino acid 294-314) and a cytoplasmic
        localization signal, which was mapped to a region partially
        overlapping with the RING finger and the coiled-coil domain
        (amino acid 67-117) [ 17 ] . Strikingly, AtCOP1 protein
        forms characteristic nuclear speckles when transiently
        expressed in onion epidermal cells or stably expressed in
        transgenic Arabidopsis [ 6 18 ] . The functional role of
        these speckles is currently unknown; however, a subnuclear
        localization signal consisting of 58 residues (amino acid
        120-177) is required for their formation [ 19 ] .
        A partial cDNA clone homologous to AtCOP1 has been
        previously identified in mammals, containing all three
        conserved protein-protein interaction domains [ 20 ] .
        Remarkably, when expressed in plant cells, the mammalian
        COP1-reporter fusion protein exhibited a light-regulated
        nuclear localization pattern similar to AtCOP1 [ 20 ] .
        Although mammalian COP1 failed to rescue the Arabidopsis 
        cop1 mutants, over-expression of the
        amino-terminal half of mammalian COP1 in Arabidopsis caused
        a dominant-negative phenotype, resembling the effect of
        over-expressing the corresponding fragment of AtCOP1 [ 20
        21 ] .
        To understand the function of COP1 in animals, we
        conducted an initial molecular characterization of
        mammalian COP1 homologues. We report here the cloning of
        the full-length mouse and human 
        COP1 cDNAs (Mus musculus 
        COP1 , 
        MmCOP1 ; Homo sapiens 
        COP1 , 
        HsCOP1 ) and the comparison of COP1
        homologues from both animals and plants in terms of both
        protein sequences and genomic structures. Moreover, we show
        that mammalian COP1 is associated with ubiquitinated
        proteins in vivo and itself a substrate of ubiquitination.
        Finally, examination of the subcellular localization
        patterns of the mammalian COP1 reveals a unique type of
        nuclear import signal and a classic nuclear export signal,
        which might be important for regulation of the mammalian
        COP1 activity.
      
      
        Results
        
          Characterization of full-length cDNAs of mouse and
          human COP1s
          The previously reported partial 
          MmCOP1 mRNA (GenBank accession
          number AF151110.1) encodes a protein product that
          corresponds to the full-length AtCOP1, but without the
          ATG start codon at its 5' end [ 20 ] . Homology search
          against the updated public EST database with the 5' end
          sequence of the available partial 
          MmCOP1 cDNA allowed the
          identification of human and mouse EST clones containing a
          predicted starting codon and a partial 5' UTR, and the
          subsequent construction of full-length 
          MmCOP1 and 
          HsCOP1 cDNAs (see Experimental
          procedures for details). The presence of stop codons just
          upstream of the predicted start codons and their
          comparable sizes with mRNA on northern blots (data not
          shown) suggest that they contain full-length coding
          capacity. The full-length 
          MmCOP1 and 
          HsCOP1 cDNAs (GenBank accession
          numbers AF151110.2 and AF508940) encode polypeptides of
          773 and 771 amino acids respectively and share 97.4%
          identity (Fig 1Aand data not shown). Compared to AtCOP1,
          the predicted full-length MmCOP1 and HsCOP1 proteins
          contain unique N-terminal glycine-serine rich extensions
          of about 70 amino acids (Fig. 1A).
          The mammalian COP1 is expressed in many different
          tissues and organs in both embryos and adults, based on
          the available EST information. Mammalian 
          COP1 EST clones have been found in
          aorta, B-cell, bladder, brain, breast, cervix, colon,
          germ cell, head/neck, heart, kidney, liver, lung,
          myotube, nerve, ovary, parathyroid, placenta, prostate,
          single cell zygote, spleen, testis, T-cell, tonsil,
          unfertilized egg, uterus, and whole embryo from human,
          mouse and rat. Northern blot analysis with selected
          tissue types confirmed this ubiquitous expression pattern
          (data not shown).
        
        
          Genomic structures of animal COP1s and the
          evolutionary implication
          Using the predicted 
          HsCOP1 cDNA sequence, BLAST
          searches against the draft human genome database revealed
          significant hits on chromosomes 1, 3, 9 and 18. Because
          only the homologous sequences on chromosome 1 match 100%
          with the 
          HsCOP1 cDNA, we conclude that the
          functional human 
          COP1 gene (designated 
          HsCOP1 ) is located on chromosome
          1q24.1 (Fig 1B), and the homologous sequences from
          chromosome 3, 9 and 18 probably represent 
          COP1 pseudogenes, as they all seem
          to encode truncated proteins. The corresponding sequenced
          BAC clones on this chromosomal location (GenBank
          accession numbers AL359265, AL162736, AL590723, and
          AL513329) can be assembled together with the reference of
          
          HsCOP1 cDNA sequences (Fig 1B). The
          
          HsCOP1 gene contains 20 exons and
          the transcribed region is about 263 kb in length (GenBank
          accession number TPA: BK000438, Fig 1B). We were also
          able to identify the full-length genomic sequence of
          mosquito 
          COP1 (Anopheles gambiae 
          COP1 , 
          AgCOP1 ) and partial genomic
          sequences of 
          MmCOP1 and fugu 
          COP1 (Fugu rubripes 
          COP1 , 
          FrCOP1 ). The genomic structures of
          the vertebrate 
          COP1 genes appear to be generally
          conserved among themselves, but different from mosquito
          and plant 
          COP1 genes (data not shown).
          BLAST searches also have identified 
          COP1 homologues from many other
          animal species, including zebrafish, frog, chicken, rat,
          cow, dog, horse, and pig. However, we have so far failed
          to find 
          COP1 homologues in Drosophila, C.
          elegans, or yeast, whose whole genome sequences are
          available. It is interesting that 
          COP1 is not found in Drosophila but
          in mosquito.
          Sequence comparison reveals that the three structural
          motifs present in Arabidopsis COP1, including the RING
          finger, the coiled coil and the WD40 domains, exist in
          COP1 proteins from all other species. The glycine-serine
          rich N-terminal sequence appears to be unique to
          vertebrate COP1s, as it is missing in mosquito and plant
          COP1 proteins. However, it should be pointed out that the
          amino acids in this region are not well conserved and
          their functional role in vertebrates is unclear.
          To reveal their evolutionary relationship, we
          generated a phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid
          sequences of the N-terminal RING finger containing
          fragments (all corresponding to the first 200 amino acids
          of HsCOP1) from representative COP1 homologues, as only
          partial COP1 sequences are available in the public
          database for some species. Similar phylogenetic trees
          were generated with or without the vertebrate specific
          N-terminal extensions, and a tree with the extension
          included in the analysis is shown in Fig 1C. As expected,
          plant and animal COP1s form distinct clades, and the
          homologies between COP1s from different species are in
          general consistency with evolutionary distances of these
          species (Fig 1C).
        
        
          The association of mammalian COP1 with
          ubiquitinated proteins in vivo
          A number of RING finger proteins have recently been
          shown to act as E3 ubiquitin ligases [ 24 ] . WD40
          domains have also been frequently found in E3 complexes
          as substrate recruiting domains [ 25 26 27 28 ] . Despite
          compelling evidence from Arabidopsis implying that COP1
          may mediate protein degradation [ 4 5 ] , no direct
          evidence of COP1 participating in ubiquitination has been
          reported.
          As an initial step to study a possible role of
          mammalian COP1 in ubiquitination, we transiently
          expressed FLAG-tagged COP1 (FLAG-COP1) in human cell line
          293 together with HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub), followed
          by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies.
          Immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with
          anti-HA antibodies detected multiple distinct bands and
          smear only when FLAG-COP1 and HA-Ub were co-expressed,
          indicating that at least a subset of COP1 associated
          proteins are ubiquitinated in human cells (Fig. 2A).
          To further investigate whether COP1 itself undergoes
          ubiquitination, a His-tagged ubiquitin expression
          construct (His-Ub) was co-transfected into the 293 cells
          with FLAG-COP1, followed by His purification under
          denaturing condition (in 8 M Urea). Under this condition,
          only those proteins covalently linked to His-Ub would be
          co-purified. Immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with
          anti-FLAG antibodies detected a higher molecular weight
          smear only upon co-expression of FLAG-COP1 and His-Ub,
          therefore confirming that COP1 is indeed a ubiquitination
          substrate (Fig. 2B). Similar data were obtained when a
          deletion construct FLAG-N280 contains an intact RING
          finger domain was used (see late in Fig 5A). Though
          FLAG-N280 was not as heavily ubiquitinated as the
          full-length FLAG-COP1, it clearly showed a ladder
          pattern, in which the size difference between neighboring
          bands of the ladder was consistent with the unit
          molecular weight of His-Ub (Fig. 2B). Therefore,
          mammalian COP1 not only associates with ubiquitinated
          proteins in vivo, but also itself a substrate for
          multi-ubiquitination.
        
        
          The mammalian COP1 protein is localized to both the
          nucleus and the cytoplasm
          The subcellular localization of AtCOP1 is regulated by
          light [ 14 ] , a feature that is critical for its
          function [ 4 29 ] . Interestingly, the localization of
          mammalian COP1 protein expressed in plant cells can also
          be regulated by light [ 20 ] , implicating a similar
          mechanism may operate for the nucleocytoplasmic
          partitioning of COP1 in mammalian cells.
          To investigate this possibility, we first set out to
          examine the subcellular localization of endogenous COP1
          in cultured mammalian cells. Polyclonal antibodies
          against a N-terminal fragment of MmCOP1 (amino acid
          71-270) were generated in rabbits and affinity purified.
          Endogenous COP1 is not detectable by immuno-fluorescence
          with our anti-COP1 antibodies, probably due to a very low
          expression level. Instead we took a subcellular
          fractionation approach to study the localization pattern
          of endogenous COP1 protein. The purified anti-COP1
          antibodies detected a unique band of about 90 kDa from
          HeLa whole cell lysates, compared to the preimmune serum
          (Fig 3A). This 90-kDa band should represent the
          endogenous COP1 based on the observations that anti-COP1
          antibodies harvested from two other rabbits detect the
          same molecular weight band (Fig 3A) and RNAi against COP1
          can specifically reduce the level of this band (our
          unpublished data). After subcellular fractionation with
          HeLa cells, each fraction underwent immunoprecipitation
          and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-COP1 antibodies.
          As shown in Fig 3B, the endogenous COP1 is localized
          predominantly in the nucleus, but small amount may also
          be present in the cytosol. Within the nucleus, COP1 is
          present in both the nucleoplasm (NP) and the nuclear
          envelope (NE) fractions, although COP1 is more enriched
          in the nucleoplasm (Fig 3B). Identical samples from all
          fractions were also probed with antibodies against other
          control proteins (Fig. 3B). As expected, Lamin A and C,
          components of nuclear lamina, were found predominantly in
          the NE fraction (Fig 3B). This fraction was also highly
          enriched in nuclear pore complexes, as evidenced by the
          enrichment of Nup62. Nup62 was detectable in smaller
          amounts in the cytosol and NP fractions as well (Fig 3B),
          consistent with its cellular distribution described
          previously [ 30 ] . On the other hand, Hsp110 was found
          predominantly in the cytosol fraction, while Hsp90 was
          found both in the cytosol and the NP fractions (Fig 3B).
          Two subunits of the COP9 signalosome, CSN2 and CSN6, were
          located both in the cytosol and the NP fractions, but not
          in the NE fractions (Fig 3B). These controls thus
          validated our fractionation results on COP1 subcellular
          distribution.
          As another line of experiments, we generated
          expression constructs containing N-terminal GFP- and
          FLAG-tagged MmCOP1 and HsCOP1. As shown in Fig. 3C, the
          subcellular localization pattern of GFP-COP1 varies when
          expressed in COS7 cells. In general, their localization
          patterns can be categorized into three types. In Type I
          cells, GFP-COP1 is expressed mostly in the cytoplasm,
          with some enrichment around the nucleus (Fig 3C, Type I).
          In Type II cells, GFP-COP1 is expressed in both the
          cytoplasm and the nucleus, and also on the NE (Fig 3C,
          Type II). In the third type, GFP-COP1 protein is
          expressed mostly in the nucleus, both in the NP and on
          the NE (Fig 3C, Type III). All three types of
          localization patterns are well represented among the
          transfected cells; their relative proportions vary in
          each experiment, but do not seem to correlate with the
          expression level of GFP-COP1. Similar results were
          obtained when other cell lines (including HeLa, NIH3T3,
          and CHO cell lines) were used or immuno-fluorescence
          studies were carried out with FLAG-COP1 instead of
          GFP-COP1 (data not shown).
        
        
          The full-length mammalian COP1 protein can localize
          to the nuclear envelope
          To test if COP1 is tightly bound to the NE, we
          extracted cells with 1% Triton X-100 before fixation.
          This treatment was shown to remove non-NE bound proteins
          from both the cytoplasm and the nucleus [ 31 ] . Indeed
          after Triton extraction, GFP-COP1 protein was completely
          eliminated from the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm (Fig
          3C, +Triton). Only NE-bound GFP-COP1 protein was
          retained, as characterized by a distinct RING-like
          pattern around the nucleus. On the other hand, GFP
          control was completely removed from the cells by the same
          treatment (data not shown), indicating that the retaining
          of GFP-COP1 on the NE is mediated by COP1 and not by the
          GFP tag. Similarly, FLAG-COP1 is also remained on the NE
          after Triton extraction (data not shown). The different
          localization patterns in different populations of cells
          imply that mammalian COP1 may partition among the NP, NE,
          and cytoplasm compartments.
        
        
          Human COP1 is part of protein complexes of over 700
          kDa
          Because HsCOP1 is enriched in the nucleoplasm fraction
          (Fig 3B), we used this fraction from HeLa cells for a gel
          filtration analysis to examine possible form(s) of HsCOP1
          in human cells. Endogenous HsCOP1 was found to accumulate
          primarily in large complexes of over 700 kDa, whereas no
          monomeric or dimeric form of HsCOP1 was detected (Fig 4).
          This finding is distinct from the observation for AtCOP1,
          which exists mainly as a homodimer [ 32 ] . In addition,
          the HsCOP1 complexes differ from the HsCOP9 signalosome
          complexes in size, as suggested by the different peak
          fractions (Fig 4). Finally, transiently expressed FLAG or
          GFP tagged HsCOP1 or MmCOP1 co-fractionates with
          endogenous COP1 (data not shown), suggesting the
          behaviors of these fusion proteins most likely represent
          the endogenous function of COP1 protein.
        
        
          Both the nuclear and the cytoplasmic localization
          signals of the mammalian COP1 are present in the
          N-terminal region
          As a first step to locate the signals responsible for
          the subcellular localization of mammalian COP1, we made a
          series of deletion constructs of GFP-MmCOP1 (Fig 5A). As
          shown in figure 5Aand 5B, GFP-ΔN70 (amino acid 71-733),
          which deleted the vertebrate specific N-terminal
          extension, also exhibited three general localization
          patterns in transfected cells, mostly cytoplasmic, in
          both compartments, or mostly nuclear, similar to
          full-length GFP-COP1 (Fig 3C). However, GFP-ΔN70 does not
          display NE localization pattern, indicating that the
          first 70 amino acid of glycine-serine rich region may be
          responsible for targeting MmCOP1 to the NE (Fig 5Aand
          5B). Similarly, AtCOP1 does not contain this region and
          is not located to NE [ 14 ] .
          Unlike GFP-ΔN70, GFP-ΔRING (amino acid 226-773) was
          only found in the cytoplasm in all the cells examined
          (Fig 5Aand 5B), suggesting that the NLS of MmCOP1 is
          probably located within amino acid 71 to 226 of MmCOP1.
          GFP-N346 (amino acid 71-416) contains the RING finger,
          the coiled-coil domain, and the region corresponding to
          the AtCOP1 NLS [ 17 ] and is localized exclusively in the
          nucleus, forming distinctive nuclear speckles (Fig 5Aand
          5B). GFP-N280 (amino acid 71-350), which contains the
          RING finger and the coiled-coil domain, but not the
          sequence corresponding to the NLS in AtCOP1, is also
          solely localized in the nucleus (Fig 5Aand 5B). However,
          unlike GFP-N346, GFP-N280 does not form speckles (Fig
          5B). These results show that the region from amino acid
          351 to 416 is not necessary for nuclear localization but
          contains a signal for speckle formation. It is worth
          noting that deletion constructs of AtCOP1 covering the
          corresponding region were found localized predominantly
          in the cytoplasm, distinct from the mouse GFP-N280 fusion
          proteins [ 17 ] .
          In contrast to GFP-N346 and GFP-N280, GFP-N200 (amino
          acid 71-270), which contains an intact RING finger and a
          partial coiled-coil domain, is localized entirely in the
          cytoplasm (Fig 5Aand 5B). Similar observations were made
          when other cell lines were used (HeLa, NIH3T3 and CHO
          cells) or by using FLAG-tagged construct series instead
          of GFP fusions (data not shown). Taken together, both the
          major nuclear and cytoplasmic localization signals seem
          to reside in the N-terminal region of MmCOP1, most likely
          between amino acid 71 and 350.
        
        
          Identification of a classic leucine-rich nuclear
          export signal in mammalian COP1
          Because both GFP-N200 and GFP-ΔRING are localized
          exclusively in the cytoplasm, the cytoplasmic
          localization signal is probably located within the
          overlapping region of these two constructs (amino acid
          226-270). Interestingly, a sequence ( 
          L AN 
          V N 
          L M 
          L E 
          LL , amino acids 237 to 247), located
          within the N-terminal region of the coiled-coil domain,
          matches classic leucine-rich nuclear export signals
          (NES), such as those from Rex and PKI (Fig 6A) [ 33 34 ]
          . In order to test if this sequence is a 
          bona fide NES, we made mutations at
          two conserved leucine residues (L234A and L236A) in the
          GFP-N200 construct (Fig 6A). The mutant protein GFP-N200
          NESmut, in contrast to wild-type GFP-N200, is entirely
          nuclear localized (Fig 6B). Furthermore, treatment of
          wild-type GFP-N200 with CRM1/exportin specific inhibitor
          Leptomycin B (LMB) also causes the protein to be
          localized exclusively in the nucleus (Fig 6B). These
          results confirmed the identified sequence ( 
          L AN 
          V N 
          L M 
          L E 
          LL ) within the coiled-coil domain of
          mammalian COP1 as a likely CRM1/exportin specific NES.
          Notably, the corresponding site in AtCOP1 is within the
          mapped cytoplasmic localization sequence [ 17 ] .
          Moreover, the NLS must also be located within amino acids
          71 to 270 of MmCOP1, since NES-mutated or LMB-treated
          N200 is nuclear localized (Fig 6B).
        
        
          Identification of amino acid clusters critical for
          mammalian COP1 nuclear import and speckle
          formation
          Nuclear import/localization signals (NLS) are usually
          composed of one or two clusters of positively charged
          amino acids. To map the nuclear import signal in
          mammalian COP1, we first identified three clusters of
          positively charged amino acids within the amino acid
          71-270 for mutagenesis. Furthermore, we also chose to
          mutate a forth positively charged amino acid cluster at
          amino acid 358 to 360, which corresponds to the
          Arabidopsis COP1 NLS [ 17 ] . Since GFP-N346 exhibited
          clear and consistent nuclear localized pattern with
          speckles most resembling the full-length MmCOP1 nuclear
          localization pattern, it was used as the starting point
          for the site-directed mutagenesis studies (Fig 7A).
          Unlike wild-type GFP-N346, GFP-N346
          NLSmut1(R113S/K114N) and GFP-N346
          NLSmut3(K205T/R206S/K208T) are totally localized to the
          cytoplasm, still forming speckles (Fig 7B). GFP-N346
          NLSmut2(K197N/K199N/R201S) is still localized to nucleus
          speckles, similar to wild-type GFP-N346 (Fig 7B).
          Comparable results were attained when the same mutations
          were introduced into GFP-N280 fusion protein (data not
          shown). Mutations of the fourth site (R358S/K360T) within
          GFP-N346, GFP-N346 NLSmut4, do not change the nuclear
          localization of GFP-N346, but abolish the speckles (Fig
          7B). Consistent with this, GFP-N280, which does not
          contain site 4, does not form nuclear speckles (Fig 5Band
          7B). These results demonstrate both sites 1 and 3 are
          required for nuclear import, while site 4 is important
          for targeting N346 to the nuclear speckles. However, we
          do not know the functional significance of the nuclear
          speckles at this time. Further, we do not know whether
          the cytoplasmic speckles formed by GFP-N346 NLSmut1and
          GFP-N346 NLSmut3are in any way related to the nuclear
          speckles of wild-type GFP-N346.
        
        
          A novel RING finger bridged bipartite nuclear
          localization signal is responsible for mammalian COP1
          nuclear localization
          In a typical bipartite NLS, the distance between the
          two clusters of positively charged amino acids is usually
          around 10 amino acids. However, the distance between site
          1 and site 3 in GFP-N346 is more than 90 amino acids
          apart, separated by the RING finger domain (Fig 7A). To
          determine whether the RING finger plays a role in
          mediating nuclear import, we mutated two key zinc-binding
          cysteine residues at the RING finger domain of GFP-N346
          (C158A/C161A, N346 RINGmut) to destroy the RING finger
          structure (Fig 7A). Indeed, these mutations abolish the
          nuclear localization of GFP-N346 (Fig 7B). The mutated
          proteins are located in cytoplasmic speckles similar to
          the N346 NLSmut1and N346 NLSmut3(Fig 7B).
          The RING fingers are characterized by four conserved
          cysteine-cysteine or cysteine-histidine pairs, which bind
          to two zinc molecules [ [ 35 36 ] ; Fig 7C]. In
          particular, cysteine pair 1 and pair 3 bind to one zinc,
          while cysteine-histidine pair 2 and cysteine pair 4 bind
          to the other zinc, thereby forming a unique cross-brace
          structure [ [ 36 ] ; Fig 7C]. Cysteine-histidine pair 2
          and cysteine pair 3 are separated by two amino acids.
          Although the sequences other than the zinc binding sites
          are not well conserved, the overall three dimensional
          structures of all the characterized RING fingers are
          overwhelmingly similar, due to the conserved spacing
          between cysteine-histidine pair 2 and cysteine pair 3 and
          the tight zinc binding ability [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 ] .
          One common feature is that the RING finger structure
          brings the flanking N and C-peptides close together. So
          possibly, the role of COP1 RING finger in nuclear import
          is to function as structural scaffold by bringing the two
          clusters of positively charged amino acids (site 1 and
          site 3) within the right spatial proximity to fit into
          the binding sites of the nuclear import machinery, as
          illustrated by Fig 7C.
          To test this hypothesis, we deleted the RING finger in
          GFP-N346 (Δ119-197) and physically put the site 1 and
          site 3 within a distance of 10 amino acids (Figure 7A).
          This mutant protein, GFP-N346 ΔRING, maintained the same
          localization pattern as wild-type GFP-N346 protein (Fig
          7B). Therefore, mammalian COP1 appears to contain a novel
          nuclear import signal, composed of two clusters of
          positively charged amino acids bridged by a RING
          finger.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Evidence for a role of COP1 in protein
          ubiquitination in vivo
          Because of its role in mediating the degradation of
          HY5, HYH, and possibly other transcription factors in
          Arabidopsis [ 4 5 ] and the presence of a RING finger
          domain and a WD-40 domain, AtCOP1 has been proposed to
          function as a RING-finger type ubiquitination E3 ligase,
          by recruiting E2 through its RING-finger domain and
          binding to the substrates through the WD-40 repeats [ 4
          43 ] . This hypothesis is also supported by the findings
          about other negative regulators of plant
          photomorphogenesis. COP10, which has been shown to
          interact with AtCOP1 in yeast two-hybrid experiment,
          encodes a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) variant [ 44
          ] . The COP9 signalosome, an eight-subunit complex
          homologous to the lid subcomplex of the 26 S proteasome [
          45 ] , directly associates with SCF E3 complex and
          promotes deneddylation of the cullin subunit of SCF in
          both plant and animal cells [ 46 47 48 49 ] . The exact
          relationship between COP1 and the COP9 signalosome
          remains obscure; it is known, however, that in
          Arabidopsis the COP9 signalosome is required for COP1 to
          accumulate in the nucleus in the dark [ 29 ] . Although
          COP1 most likely plays a role in regulating protein
          degradation, attempts in reconstituting ubiquitination of
          HY5 by AtCOP1 have been unsuccessful. Instead, CIP8, an
          AtCOP1 interacting RING-H2 finger protein, is found to
          ubiquitinate HY5 in vitro [ 50 51 ] . Therefore, it is
          possible that COP1 may recruit other RING finger
          proteins, such as CIP8, to mediate the ubiquitination of
          specific substrates. The existence of mammalian COP1 in
          large complex forms is consistent with this possibility.
          In this study, we have demonstrated the mammalian COP1 is
          associated with ubiquitinated proteins and itself a
          substrate for ubiquitination in vivo. However, we have
          failed to reconstitute the ubiquitination activity of
          mammalian COP1 in vitro. Purification of the mammalian
          COP1 complex may hold a key to understand how COP1
          mediates protein ubiquitination and degradation in the
          cells.
        
        
          Molecular basis for mammalian COP1 subcellular
          localization and its possible regulation
          Endogenous mammalian COP1 is found in the cytosol, NP,
          and NE fractions in our subcellular fractionation study,
          with majority of the protein in the NP fraction (Fig 4A).
          In our fluorescence localization studies with multiple
          mammalian cell lines, transiently over-expressed COP1 is
          prevalent in the cytoplasm, but also on the NE and within
          the nucleus (Fig 4B). This discrepancy is probably due to
          the over-expression of mammalian COP1 in the latter
          system. It is worth noting that endogenous COP1 appears
          to be expressed at very low levels in all of the
          mammalian cells we have tested.
          Through systematic mutagenesis studies, we have been
          able to locate both the NLS and the NES to the N-terminal
          region of the mammalian COP1 protein (Fig 6and Fig 7).
          Deletion constructs, GFP-N346, GFP-N280 and GFP-N200, all
          contain both the NLS and the NES, but their subcellular
          localization patterns are strikingly different. GFP-N346
          and GFP-N280 are localized exclusively to the nucleus,
          while GFP-N200 is localized entirely to the cytoplasm
          (Fig 5). However, treatment with LMB completely shifts
          GFP-N200 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, implying
          GFP-N200 may shuttle between the nucleus and the
          cytoplasm, consistent with the existence of both the NES
          and the NLS in GFP-N200 (Fig 6and Fig 7). The different
          domain compositions of GFP-346, GFP-N280 and GFP-N200 may
          explain the distinct localization patterns of these
          mutant proteins. NES is located within the coiled-coil
          domain (Fig 6), so it is plausible that the intact
          coiled-coil structure in GFP-N346 or GFP-N280 masks the
          NES, possibly through interactions with other proteins.
          On the other hand, the truncated coiled-coil domain in
          GFP-N200 is unable to shield the NES from binding to
          CRM1/exportin. Since GFP-N200 is primarily localized to
          the cytoplasm, the NES is likely dominant over the NLS in
          mammalian COP1 protein. It is tempting to speculate that,
          under certain conditions, the mammalian COP1 NES is
          shielded within the coiled-coil structure and COP1
          protein is imported into the nucleus through the RING
          finger bridged NLS; under other conditions, probably
          through a conformation change of the coiled-coil domain,
          the NES is exposed, overwriting the NLS and transporting
          mammalian COP1 back into the cytoplasm. However, we
          cannot rule out the possibility that a second set of
          unidentified NLS between amino acid 271-350 may be
          responsible for the nuclear localization of GFP-N280 and
          GFP-N346.
          This study reveals a novel type of nuclear
          localization signal within the mammalian COP1 N-terminal
          region, consisting of a two clusters of positively
          charged amino acids bridged by a RING finger domain (Fig
          7). Both clusters of positively charged amino acids are
          required and can function as a classic bipartite NLS when
          placed within the right distance (Fig 7). Disrupting the
          structure of the RING finger abolishes nuclear import,
          but removing the entire RING finger restores nuclear
          import (Fig 7).
          A RING finger sandwiched between a bipartite NLS could
          provide additional regulatory mechanisms for nuclear
          import. In order to be transported into the nucleus, it
          is necessary for a protein to bind to the nuclear import
          machinery, such as importin α/β, through its NLS. Our
          studies suggest the mammalian COP1 RING finger acts as a
          structural scaffold by placing the two clusters of
          positive residues within the right spatial proximity for
          binding to the nuclear import machinery. Since the RING
          finger is a protein-protein interaction domain,
          interaction of the mammalian COP1 RING finger with
          another protein may, under certain conditions, trigger a
          conformational change of the surrounding peptides,
          altering the proximity between the two positive residue
          clusters of the NLS to disrupt binding to the nuclear
          import machinery. Alternatively, recruitment of another
          protein to the mammalian COP1 RING finger may sterically
          hinder access of its NLS to the nuclear import
          machinery.
        
        
          RING finger - ubiquitination and/or subcellular
          localization?
          Within the past few years, the RING finger motif has
          emerged as a core structure feature for many ubiquitin
          ligases (E3s) [ 52 ] . In most cases, RING fingers
          function as E2 recruiting domains, and by directly
          interacting with E2s, bring E2s in the vicinity of
          ubiquitination substrates, which bind to other parts of
          the RING finger proteins or other subunits of the RING
          finger protein containing complexes. Although most
          evidence suggests that RING fingers may not directly
          participate in the enzymatic transferring of ubiquitin
          from E2s to the substrates, intact RING structures are
          essential for this function. In addition to the key roles
          in E3 ligase activity, RING finger domains have also been
          shown to be important for regulating subcellular
          localization of E3s and/or their substrates in a number
          of cases [ 53 54 55 56 ] . Studies have shown the MDM2
          RING finger domain is required to promote nuclear export
          of p53 and this activity of MDM2 RING finger seems to be
          coupled with its ability to promote ubiquitination of p53
          [ 53 54 55 ] . Rbx1/ROC1, the small RING finger subunit
          of the SCF E3 complexes, promotes the nuclear
          accumulation of Cul1, another subunit of the SCF
          complexes [ 56 ] . These studies have suggested a
          correlation between the ubiquitination activities of RING
          fingers and their roles in regulating subcellular
          localization of the E3 ligases which they are part
          of.
          Our results suggest that mammalian COP1 might play a
          role in ubiquitination (Fig 2). If COP1 is indeed an E3,
          its RING finger is likely to be indispensable for this
          function, considering the numerous examples of other RING
          fingers. On the other hand, we have also demonstrated
          that the RING finger is required for the nuclear
          localization of mammalian COP1 (Fig 7). Thus, COP1 RING
          finger could also play dual roles in ubiquitination as
          well as nuclear import.
        
        
          Distinction in subcellular localization signals
          between higher plant and mammalian COP1 proteins
          Comparison of the subcellular localization signals
          uncovers clear distinctions between AtCOP1 and MmCOP1. In
          AtCOP1, the sequence responsible for the cytoplasmic
          localization is mapped to the region bordering both the
          RING finger and the coiled-coil domain, composed of 110
          amino acids [ [ 17 ] ; Fig 8]. In MmCOP1, we have
          identified a single 10-amino acid classic leucine-rich
          NES within the corresponding region (Fig 8), even though
          we have not eliminated the possible involvement of other
          sequences. The mammalian COP1 also has a unique
          N-terminal extension that seems to involve in localizing
          the protein into the nuclear envelope (Fig 8). We have
          defined MmCOP1 NLS as a RING finger mediated bipartite
          NLS variant, which is composed of 96 amino acids
          surrounding the RING finger domain (Fig 8). In contrast,
          the AtCOP1 NLS has been identified as a classic bipartite
          nuclear localization signal, consisting of 21 amino acids
          in the intermediate region of coiled-coil domain and the
          WD-40 domain [ [ 17 ] ; Fig 8]. Interestingly in MmCOP1,
          the site matching the AtCOP1 NLS is found to be important
          for targeting the nuclear localized MmCOP1 deletion
          construct N346 to speckles rather than mediating nuclear
          import (Fig 8). On the other hand, the site responsible
          for speckle formation is mapped within the cytoplasmic
          localization signal in AtCOP1 [ [ 19 ] ; Fig 8]. One
          explanation for these discrepancies between AtCOP1 and
          MmCOP1 is that during the course of evolution, the animal
          and the plant COP1 proteins have adopted different
          regulatory mechanisms and probably different
          physiological and developmental functions. However, the
          protein sequences of the three major protein-protein
          interactive domains (RING, Coiled coil, WD-40 repeats)
          are highly conserved, possibly due to conserved
          biochemical activity of COP1 in all organisms. Another
          possibility is that different cell types may use
          completely different subcellular targeting signals. It is
          plausible that in some other mammalian cell types,
          subcellular targeting signals similar to Arabidopsis may
          be used. This speculation would be consistent with the
          fact that the subcellular localization of AtCOP1 is
          regulated by light only in certain types of plant cells [
          14 ] . Furthermore, the protein fragments responsible for
          regulating subcellular localization of AtCOP1 are quite
          conserved in MmCOP1, which may explain why the mammalian
          COP1, when expressed in onion epidermal cells, can be
          regulated by light in a similar manner as AtCOP1 [ 20 ] .
          However, the same nuclear translocation signal of AtCOP1
          has been used in all plant cell types examined [ 17 19 ]
          , which argue against the later hypothesis.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In this study, we cloned the full-length mouse and human
        
        COP1 cDNAs. Furthermore, we
        demonstrated that mammalian COP1 is associated with
        ubiquitinated proteins in vivo and itself a substrate of
        ubiquitination. Finally, through subcellular localization
        studies, we identified a unique type of nuclear import
        signal and a classic nuclear export signal within the
        N-terminal region of mammalian COP1, which might be
        important for regulation of the mammalian COP1
        activity.
      
      
        Methods
        
          DNA constructs
          To obtain the full-length 
          MmCOP1 cDNA, an EST clone (GenBank
          accession number AI509164) containing the N-terminal
          region of 
          MmCOP1 cDNA in pT7T3D-Pac vector
          was obtained from ResGen and digested with XhoI and Hind
          III. The resulting fragment was subcloned into the same
          sites of pBlueScript II KS (+). The resulting construct
          was further digested with NotI and PstI and combined with
          a NotI-PstI fragment containing the remaining c-terminal
          portion of a previously described 
          MmCOP1 cDNA clone (GenBank
          accession number AF151110.1) [ 20 ] , resulting in
          pKS-COP1. To generate pEGFP-COP1, pKS-COP1 was digested
          with ApaI and XbaI and the resulting fragment containing
          the 
          MmCOP1 cDNA was subcloned into the
          same sites of the pEGFP I vector. The pFLAG-COP1 was
          generated by subcloning a SalI-XbaI fragment of
          pEGFP-COP1 containing the 
          MmCOP1 cDNA into the same sites of
          pFLAG-CMV II vector. Direct sequencing was used to ensure
          in-frame insertions of these constructs. pEGFP-N280 and
          pFLAG-N280 were generated by inserting a HindIII-StyI
          fragment (containing amino acid 70-350 of MmCOP1; StyI
          site was filled in by Klenow DNA polymerase) into pEGFP
          and pFLAG-CMV vectors digested by HindIII and SmaI.
          pEGFP-N346 was generated by inserting a HindIII-NdeI
          fragment (containing amino acid 70-416 of MmCOP1; NdeI
          site was filled in by Klenow DNA polymerase) into pEGFP
          vector digested by HindIII and SmaI. pEGFP-N280 was
          digested with EcoRI and BamHI, filled in with Klenow DNA
          polymerase on both ends, and re-ligated to generate
          pEGFP-N200. Point mutations were introduced by using the
          QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from
          Stratagene. pEGFP-N346 ΔRINGwas obtained by first
          introducing two XhoI sites into the construct,
          subsequently digesting with XhoI, and then re-ligating.
          The plasmids HA-Ub and His-Ub were described previously [
          22 ] .
        
        
          Genomic DNA and mRNA predications
          The genomic sequences of different 
          COP1 orthologs were identified by
          BLASTn search with 
          HsCOP1 or 
          MmCOP1 cDNA sequence, or by tBLASTn
          search with HsCOP1 protein sequence in the following
          genomic blast sites:
          http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/HsBlast.htmlfor
          human genome;
          http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/MmBlast.htmlfor
          mouse genome;
          http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMGifs/Genomes/agambiae.htmlfor
          mosquito; and
          http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/fugu.htmlfor fugu
          genome.
          Full-length or partial cDNA sequences of the 
          COP1 homologues in human, rat, cow,
          pig, Xenopus, chicken, and zebrafish were predicted by
          assembling the available homologous EST sequences from
          each species. A single EST clone (GenBank accession
          number BI461685) containing the full-length 
          HsCOP1 open reading frame was
          obtained from ResGen and the coding region of 
          HsCOP1 was sequenced. Eight EST
          clones from Rattus norvegicus (GenBank accession number
          AI071032, AW525130, BF560126, R47114, AW141780, BF285727,
          AW917150, and BF285717) were assembled into a near
          full-length rat 
          COP1 cDNA ( 
          RnCOP1 ). Partial cow 
          COP1 cDNA ( 
          BtCOP1 ) was predicted from six Bos
          taurus ESTs (GenBank accession number AV608813, AW462260;
          BE478862, BF042569; AW326433 and BF440399). Only one EST
          clone (GenBank accession number AW787013) was found from
          the pig (Sus scrofa) to be homologous to the 
          HsCOP1 3-prime end. A zebrafish EST
          clone (GenBank accession number AI959013) was found
          homologous to the N terminal end of HsCOP1. Four EST
          clones from Xenopus laevis were identified through blast
          search against the HsCOP1 protein sequence. Of them,
          three were overlapping clones and were assembled into a
          fragment homologous to the N-terminal region of the
          HsCOP1 protein (GenBank accession number BE506274,
          BE679680, and BE026293) and one clone was homologous to
          the C-terminal end of the HsCOP1 protein (GenBank
          accession number BG345699). One chicken EST clone
          (GenBank accession number BM487594) was found homologous
          to the N-terminal end of HsCOP1.
          The mRNA sequences of FrCOP1 and AgCOP1 are predicted
          from scaffold 5023 and scaffold CRA_x9P1GAV59LQ of the
          draft fugu and mosquito genomic sequences.
        
        
          Cell culture and transfection
          Cell line 293, COS7 and HeLa were grown in DMEM medium
          supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
          (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mouse NIH3T3 cell line was
          grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% calf serum
          (Life Technologies, Inc.). For protein expression, cells
          were transfected with various plasmids using the
          LipofectMINE or LipofectMINE 2000 Reagent according to
          the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies,
          Inc.). Total amounts of plasmid DNA in individual
          transfection experiments were adjusted using empty vector
          plasmids. Transfected cells were cultured for at least 24
          hours after transfection and used for
          immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and
          immunocytochemistry.
        
        
          Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
          Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,
          containing 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 
          2 , 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1
          mM PMSF) with 1 × proteasome inhibitor cocktail
          (Boehringer Mannhein). Immunoprecipitations from the
          transfected cell lysates were performed with anti-FLAG
          antibody coupled Agarose beads (Sigma) and then the beads
          were washed six times in the lysis buffer.
          Immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were analyzed by
          immunoblot analysis. Anti-FLAG (M2) antibody was
          purchased from Sigma. The anti-HA anti-mAb414 monoclonal
          antibody was purchased from Covance. The anti-Lamin A/C
          antibody was purchased from Stratagene. Antibodies
          against the heat shock proteins were purchased from
          Transduction laboratories.
        
        
          Purification of His-tagged protein
          Cells were lysed in a denaturing lysis buffer (8 M
          urea, 0.1 M NaH 
          2 PO 
          4 and 0.01 M Tris•Cl, pH 8.0) and then
          briefly sonicated in full speed. After centrifugation at
          maximum speed for 15 minutes, the supernatant was
          incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) for 1.5 hour at room
          temperature. The resin was washed six times in a
          denaturing wash buffer (8 M urea, 0.1 M NaH 
          2 PO 
          4 and 0.01 M Tris•Cl, pH 6.3) and then
          boiled for 10 minutes in equal volumes of 2 × SDS loading
          buffer.
        
        
          Cell fractionation
          Cell-fractionation was carried out mostly 
          as previously described [ 23 ] .
          For isolation of nuclei and nuclear envelopes, HeLa cells
          from 10 15-cm culture dishes were washed twice with
          ice-cold PBS and scraped off in PBS. After centrifugation
          at 500 g for 5 minutes the cells were resuspended in 10
          ml of STM 0.25 (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 M sucrose, 5
          mM MgSO 
          4 , 2 mM DTT, 1× protease inhibitor
          cocktail, 1 mM PMSF). The following manipulations were
          performed either with ice-cold reagents or at 4°C unless
          noted. A solution of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to a
          final concentration of 0.025%. The pellets were
          homogenized by 30-40 strokes in a glass-glass Dounce
          homogenizer. The homogenate was adjusted to 1.4 M sucrose
          by addition of an appropriate volume of STM 2.1 (50 mM
          Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 2.1 M sucrose, 5 mM MgSO 
          4 , 2 mM DTT, 1× protease inhibitor
          cocktail, 1 mM PMSF). 2.5 ml of this suspension were
          transferred to each centrifuge tube and laid between a
          100 ul STM 2.1 cushion and 200 ul of STM 0.8 (50 mM
          Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.8 M sucrose, 5 mM MgSO 
          4 , 2 mM DTT, 1× protease inhibitor
          cocktail, 1 mM PMSF). The tubes were then filled with STM
          025 and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 65 minutes in a
          fixed-angle rotor. The pellets containing the nuclei were
          washed twice with STM 0.25. Integrity and purity of the
          nuclei were judged by phase contrast microscopy.
          The nuclei prepared above were suspended in 10 ml of
          ice-cold TP buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM Na 
          2 HPO 
          4 , 1 mM PMSF) containing 0.3 mg/ml
          heparin and 36 u/ml of DNase I. The suspension was gently
          stirred on a magnetic stirrer for 60 minutes at 4°C and
          15 minutes at room temperature. Nuclear envelopes were
          sedimented at 10,000 g for 30 minutes at 4°C and washed
          once with STM 0.25.
          The homogenate of cells, prepared as described above,
          was centrifuged at 170 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The
          supernatant was centrifuged at 300 g for 5 minutes at 4
          °C and sedimented at 15,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The
          pellet was washed with STM 0.25 and designated as crude
          mitochondria fraction. The supernatant was diluted with 1
          volume of STM 0.0 (STM 0.25 without sucrose) and
          centrifuged at 105,000 g overnight at 4°C. The resulting
          supernatant and pellet yielded the cytosolic fraction and
          the microsomal fraction, respectively.
        
        
          Gel filtration chromatography
          Subcellular fractions were fractionated over a 25 ml
          Superose-6 FPLC column (Pharmacia) with 1× gel filtration
          buffer (25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 220 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl 
          2 , 1 μM ZnSO 
          4 ) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. All
          procedures were carried out at 4°C. Consecutive fractions
          of 0.5 ml each were collected after the void volume (7
          ml), concentrated with StrataClean resin (Stratagene),
          and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot
          analysis.
        
        
          Immunofluorescence and triton-extraction
          Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and
          indirectly immunostained with an anti-FLAG antibody
          (Sigma) and then a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse
          secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). DAPI (Sigma) was
          used for nuclear counterstaining. For certain
          experiments, cells were extracted with 1% Triton-X 100 in
          PBS for 10 minutes on ice and then washed three times in
          PBS before fixation. Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence
          microscope was used for observation. The images were
          taken using the Zeiss AxioCam HRc digital imaging
          system.
