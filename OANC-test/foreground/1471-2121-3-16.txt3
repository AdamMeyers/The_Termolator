        The 
        B em 
        1 - 
        i nteracting proteins Boi1 and
        Boi2 were identified from screens for proteins that display
        two-hybrid interaction with the 
        b ud- 
        em ergence protein Bem1 [ 1 2 ] ,
        a protein that is important for the initiation of budding
        and that contains two SH3 domains. Boi1 and Boi2 are
        similar in sequence to one another. Each contains an SH3
        domain; a SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain; a proline-rich
        region, which mediates binding to the second SH3 domain of
        Bem1; and a PH domain [ 1 2 3 ] . Figure 1shows the
        relative positions of these sequence features in Boi1.
        Deletion of either 
        BOI1 or 
        BOI2 alone has little effect on
        growth. However, deletion of both genes together is lethal
        (at least in some strains), suggesting that Boi1 and Boi2
        perform at least one important, shared function [ 1 2 ]
        .
        The functions of Boi1/Boi2 appear to be linked to those
        of Cdc42 and Rho3, which are Rho-type GTPases that are
        important for polarized cell growth [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 ] . Boi1
        and Boi2 display two-hybrid interactions with both
        wild-type and mutationally activated Cdc42 but not with a
        mutant version of Cdc42 that is predicted to be impaired in
        the ability to bind nucleotide, suggesting that Boi1 and
        Boi2 may associate with the GTP-bound ("active") form of
        Cdc42 [ 1 ] . Further evidence that some function of Boi1
        is linked to that of Cdc42 is that overexpression of Boi1
        inhibits bud emergence and that this inhibition can be
        suppressed by overexpression of Cdc42 [ 1 2 ] . 
        RHO3 can serve as a multicopy
        suppressor of the lethality caused by deletion of 
        BOI1 and 
        BOI2 [ 1 2 ] . These findings are
        consistent with the possibilities that Boi1 and Boi2 are
        targets of Cdc42 that promote cell growth in a manner that
        is regulated by Rho3.
        Support for the view that Boi1 and Boi2 are involved in
        polarized growth comes from the analysis of fission yeast
        Pob1, which is a homolog of Boi1 and Boi2. In particular,
        in 
        S. pombe cells, Pob1 is localized to
        sites of polarized growth, loss of Pob1 function leads to a
        loss of polarized growth, and overexpression of Pob1 causes
        cell growth to become depolarized [ 10 ] .
        The PH domain appears to be a critical feature of Boi1:
        mutations in this domain destroy Boi1 function, and Boi1-PH
        (see Fig. 1) can substitute in function for Boi1 and Boi2 [
        1 ] . In addition, Boi1-PH contains the region of Boi1 that
        displays the two-hybrid interaction with Cdc42, raising the
        possibility that the PH domain, itself, mediates or
        regulates the association with Cdc42 [ 1 ] .
        A generally shared feature of PH domains is the ability
        to bind acidic phospholipids, usually one or more derived
        from PI (phosphatidylinositol) and, in some cases, also PS
        [ 11 12 ] . In some proteins, the main role of the binding
        of PH domains to phospholipids may simply be to promote
        association with membrane (i.e., to serve as a
        membrane-localization tag) [ 13 14 ] . In other proteins,
        the binding of PH domains to phospholipids appears to be
        important for allosteric or other types of regulation [ 15
        16 ] .
        Given that 1) Boi1 and Boi2 are important proteins whose
        functions appear to be linked to those of Cdc42 and Rho3,
        2) the PH domain appears to be of particular importance for
        Boi1 function, and 3) a general role of PH domains may be
        to bind acidic phospholipids, we wanted to know whether the
        PH domain of Boi1 binds acidic phospholipids and, if it
        does, whether this binding is important for the function
        and proper localization of Boi1. In the current study, we
        investigate these issues as a first step toward eludicating
        roles of Boi1's PH domain.
      
      
        Results
        
          Binding of Boi1-PH to phospholipids
          In all binding analyses reported in this study, we
          used Boi1-PH (see Fig. 1) rather than full-length Boi1,
          because we wanted to focus on interactions mediated by
          the PH domain. Also, we needed to have a soluble pool of
          protein for vesicle co-sedimentation studies, and while
          most of the Boi1-PH was soluble (at least when
          overexpressed), virtually none of the full-length Boi1
          was soluble (whether or not overexpressed).
          Fortuitously, we discovered that Boi1-PH can be
          proteolyzed in yeast extracts in a manner that is
          stimulated by PIP 
          2 . Figure 2Ashows an example of this
          phenomenon; whereas most of the anti-Boi1
          immunoreactivity was present in a single band when
          Boi1-PH was incubated with control PS vesicles that
          lacked PIP 
          2 , almost all of the anti-Boi1
          immunoreactivity was present in faster-migrating bands
          when Boi1-PH was incubated with PS vesicles that
          contained PIP 
          2 (lanes 1 and 5). (In this and all
          subsequent experiments that use PIP 
          2 /PS mixed vesicles, the mass ratio
          of PIP 
          2 :PS was 1:20.) Less total anti-Boi1
          immunoreactivity was recovered when Boi1-PH was incubated
          with PIP 
          2 /PS mixed vesicles than when
          incubated with vesicles containing only PS (lanes 1 and
          5), suggesting that the faster-migrating species
          represent degradation products of Boi1-PH. Consistent
          with this view, although Boi1-PH remained stable when
          incubated for longer intervals with vesicles that
          contained only PS, the anti-Boi1 immunoreactive bands
          became fainter and then disappeared altogether when
          incubated for longer intervals with PIP 
          2 /PS mixed vesicles (data not
          shown).
          The finding that PIP 
          2 can stimulate degradation of Boi1-PH
          suggests that PIP 
          2 may bind to Boi1-PH in a manner that
          results in the exposure of a protease-sensitive site. We
          do not know the identity of the relevant protease.
          However, we found that the PIP 
          2 -stimulated proteolysis of Boi1-PH
          is strongly enhanced by Ca ++and is inhibited by EGTA
          (data not shown), suggesting that this protease may
          require Ca ++for activity.
          Next, we asked whether proteolysis of Boi1-PH could
          also be stimulated by other inositol-based phospholipids.
          PI and PI3P (phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate), presented
          in PS-based vesicles, appeared to stimulate slightly the
          proteolysis of Boi1-PH, but did so to a much lesser
          extent than did PIP 
          2 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-3 and 5). In
          contrast, PI4P (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate)/PS
          vesicles stimulated substantial proteolysis of Boi1-PH,
          although to a lesser extent than did PIP 
          2 /PS vesicles (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and
          5). These findings indicate that different
          phosphatidylinositides can stimulate proteolysis of
          Boi1-PH but differ greatly in their abilities to do
          so.
          To investigate whether the nature of the bulk lipid in
          the vesicles affects the ability of
          phosphatidylinositides to stimulate proteolysis of
          Boi1-PH, we repeated this analysis using the neutral
          phospholipid PC (phosphatidylcholine) instead of PS.
          Using reaction conditions that were otherwise the same as
          those used when PS was the bulk lipid, no proteolysis of
          Boi1-PH was detected in the presence of any of the
          phosphatidylinositides except PIP 
          2 , which stimulated only a small
          amount of proteolysis (Fig. 2B). Thus, PS is much more
          effective than PC at facilitating the ability of
          phosphatidylinositides to stimulate proteolysis of
          Boi1-PH.
          To investigate further whether Boi1-PH binds PIP 
          2 , we used a vesicle co-sedimentation
          assay. In this analysis, we asked whether an otherwise
          soluble fraction of Boi1-PH, after being incubated with
          PIP 
          2 -bearing vesicles, would now
          sediment in conditions (436,000 × g for 1 hr) that cause
          vesicles to pellet. (To inhibit the proteolysis of
          Boi1-PH, we performed this analysis in buffer that lacks
          Ca ++but that contains EGTA and two other protease
          inhibitors that were not present in the proteolysis
          assay.) First, we asked whether Boi1-PH could pellet with
          vesicles that lacked PIP 
          2 . We did not detect any pelleting of
          Boi1-PH with PC vesicles (data not shown), but found that
          Boi1-PH could pellet with vesicles composed of PS (Fig.
          3, top panel), suggesting that Boi1-PH can bind PS.
          Next, we asked whether the inclusion of PIP 
          2 in the PS vesicles affected the
          ability of Boi1-PH to pellet. In the starting buffer
          conditions (phosphate-buffered saline without additional
          salt), a larger percentage of Boi1-PH pelleted when the
          vesicles contained PIP 
          2 (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). However,
          most of the Boi1-PH pelleted whether or not PIP 
          2 was present. So, to try to
          accentuate the effects of PIP 
          2 on Boi1-PH's co-sedimentation with
          vesicles, we repeated this analysis using buffer that
          contained additional concentrations of KCl. In the
          presence of 50, 100, and 200 mM additional KCl, the ratio
          of Boi1-PH that pelleted with respect to that which
          stayed in the supernatant was greater when using vesicles
          that contained PIP 
          2 (Fig. 3, lanes 3-8), suggesting that
          Boi1-PH has a higher affinity for PIP 
          2 than for PS.
          In similar experiments using mixed PIP 
          2 /PC vesicles, all of the Boi1-PH
          stayed in the soluble fraction (data not shown),
          supporting the views that the composition of the lipid
          bilayer affects the ability of Boi1-PH to bind PIP 
          2 and that PS promotes this
          association.
        
        
          Mutant versions of Boi1-PH that are impaired in the
          ability to bind PIP 2
          To investigate whether binding to PIP 
          2 may be important for Boi1 function,
          we sought to make mutant versions of Boi1-PH that are
          defective in the ability to bind PIP 
          2 . As a guide for designing such
          mutants, we used information about one of the PH domains
          from pleckstrin. Figure 4shows those positions in the
          N-terminal PH domain of pleckstrin that have been
          implicated, based on NMR analysis, to contact PIP 
          2 [ 17 ] . Boi1's PH domain has
          identical or similar amino acids at most of the analogous
          positions (Fig. 4).
          To obtain mutant versions of Boi1 that might be
          defective in the ability to bind PIP 
          2 , we created three sets of mutations
          that resulted in amino-acid subsitutions at some of those
          positions. We call these sets of substitutions "KK"
          (K785E and K786A), "TK" (T793A and K795E), and "KKTK"
          (K785E, K786A, T793A, and K795E; a combination of the KK
          and TK sets) (Fig. 4).
          To investigate whether these substitutions affect the
          ability of Boi1-PH to bind PIP 
          2 , we first used the proteolysis
          assay. We found that, in conditions in which PIP 
          2 stimulated proteolysis of most of
          the wild-type Boi1-PH, PIP 
          2 did not stimulate the proteolysis of
          the TK, KK, and KKTK versions of Boi1-PH (Fig. 5A, lanes
          3, 6, 9, and 12), suggesting that all three sets of
          substitutions may disrupt binding to PIP 
          2 and/or PS.
          To investigate further whether the three sets of
          substitutions affect the ability of Boi1-PH to bind these
          lipids, we used the vesicle co-sedimentation assay. In
          the presence of vesicles composed of only PS, an
          appreciable amount of Boi1-PH(KK) pelleted (Fig. 5B,
          second panel, lanes 3 and 4). However, the percentage of
          Boi1-PH(KK) that pelleted was less than that for
          wild-type Boi1-PH (Fig. 5B, top and second panels, lanes
          3 and 4), suggesting that the KK substitutions reduce
          somewhat the binding affinity for PS. The TK
          substitutions had a more obvious effect: no Boi1-PH(TK)
          was seen to pellet with PS vesicles (Fig. 5B, third
          panel, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that the TK
          substitutions impaired binding to PS to a greater extent
          than did the KK substitutions. As expected, given that
          the TK substitutions were sufficient to severely affect
          pelleting with PS vesicles, none of the Boi1-PH(KKTK) was
          seen to co-sediment with PS vesicles (Fig. 5B, bottom
          panel, lanes 3 and 4).
          Whereas inclusion of PIP 
          2 in the vesicles increased the amount
          of wild-type Boi1-PH that co-sedimented, PIP 
          2 did not have an obvious effect on
          the co-sedimentation behavior of Boi1-PH(KK) (Fig. 5B,
          top and second panels, lanes 3-6), suggesting that the KK
          substitutions impair binding to PIP 
          2 . In contrast, the TK mutant version
          of Boi1-PH appeared to retain a slight ability to pellet
          with PIP 
          2 /PS vesicles (Fig. 5B, third panel,
          lanes 3-6).
          None of the Boi1-PH(KKTK) was detected in the pellet
          fraction even when using vesicles that contained PIP 
          2 (Fig. 5A, bottom panel, lanes 5 and
          6), consistent with the view that the KKTK mutant is more
          severely impaired in the ability to bind PIP 
          2 than are the KK and TK mutants.
        
        
          Exploring the significance of binding to
          phospholipids
          To investigate whether binding to phospholipid may be
          important for Boi1 function, we used a red/white,
          colony-sectoring assay to test whether the KK, TK, and
          KKTK mutant versions of Boi1 could substitute in function
          for wild-type 
          BOI1 and 
          BOI2 . For this analysis, we used
          strain PY967, which lacks the genomic copies of 
          BOI1 and 
          BOI2 and which is kept alive by 
          BOI1 -bearing plasmid pPB799.
          pPB799 also contains the 
          ADE3 color marker. Cells that have
          this plasmid are red, while those that fail to inherit it
          are white. PY967 cells form thoroughly red colonies
          (lacking white sectors), because cells that fail to
          inherit the plasmid lack 
          BOI1 and so do not propagate.
          However, when transformed with a second plasmid that can
          substitute in function for 
          BOI1 , PY967 cells that fail to
          inherit pPB799 are still viable and so give rise to white
          sectors.
          To test the different versions of 
          BOI1 for function, we introduced
          them on plasmids into strain PY967, at both 23 and 30°C,
          and then scored the degree of sectoring of the resultant
          transformant colonies. For each plasmid tested,
          approximately 200 colonies from each transformation plate
          were analyzed at each temperature. As negative and
          positive controls for sectoring, we used an empty plasmid
          and one that contains wild-type 
          BOI1 , respectively. As indicated
          in Figure 6, the empty plasmid (-) gave no sectoring
          colonies, indicating that the level of background
          sectoring in this assay is low. The plasmid that contains
          wild-type 
          BOI1 gave a range of sectoring
          abilities, with 71 and 79% of the colonies showing a
          moderate or heavy degree of sectoring at 23 and 30°C,
          respectively (Fig. 6).
          At both temperatures, the TK mutant version of Boi1
          allowed a substantial fraction of colonies to show either
          moderate or heavy sectoring (Fig. 6), suggesting that the
          TK mutant is able to provide whatever vital function
          normally is provided by Boi1/Boi2. However, this version
          of Boi1 appeared to function less efficiently than did
          wild-type Boi1: at 23°C, the percentage of colonies that
          showed either moderate or heavy sectoring with Boi1(TK)
          was only 29%, and, at 30°C, the percentage of colonies
          that showed moderate or heavy sectoring with Boi1(TK) was
          only 10%.
          At each temperature, almost every one of the colonies
          of cells that contained either the KK or KKTK mutant
          versions of Boi1 showed no sectoring (Fig. 6), suggesting
          that these mutant versions of Boi1 provide little or no
          function.
          To investigate whether the diminished amount of
          sectoring allowed by the different mutant versions of
          Boi1 might be due to effects of the amino-acid
          substitutions on the concentration of Boi1 (e.g., by
          decreasing the stability of Boi1), we used immunoblotting
          to compare the concentrations of the mutant proteins to
          that of wild-type Boi1. This analysis was done using a
          genomically 
          boi1 BOI2 strain, so that the only
          version of Boi1 present was the one expressed from a
          plasmid. As shown in Figure 7A, each of the mutant
          versions of Boi1 is present at a concentration similar to
          or higher than that of wild-type Boi1, suggesting that
          the reduced functions of the mutant versions of Boi1 are
          not likely to be due to effects on their
          concentrations.
          One potential role of the binding of Boi1 to
          phospholipid is simply to target Boi1 to the plasma
          membrane. If this were the only role for such binding,
          then attachment to a membrane-localization tag might be
          able to restore function to versions of Boi1 that are
          impaired in the ability to bind phospholipid. One type of
          membrane-localization tag is the myristoyl group, which
          is attached to the glycine residue of proteins, such as 
          S. cerevisiae Gpa1 (the α subunit
          of the pheromone-responsive G protein) [ 18 ] , that
          contain at their N-termini the sequence MGXXXS/T (where
          "X" can be any amino acid) [ 19 ] . Thus, we investigated
          whether fusion to the sequence MGCTVS, which is present
          at the N-terminus of Gpa1 and which we will henceforth
          refer to as "Myr", could restore function to the mutant
          versions of Boi1 that are impaired in the ability to bind
          phospholipid.
          At the time that we initiated this analysis, the only
          lipid-binding-impaired version of Boi1 that we had
          generated so far was the KK mutant. In preliminary
          analyses, we found that Myr did not improve the ability
          of full-length Boi1(KK) to promote sectoring, but that it
          did improve the ability of the KK version of Boi1-PH to
          promote sectoring (data not shown). Therefore, in
          subsequent tests to ask whether Myr could restore
          function to mutant versions of Boi1 that are impaired in
          the ability to bind lipid, we used specifically the
          Boi1-PH segment of Boi1 rather than full-length Boi1.
          First, we checked to see whether Myr had any
          inhibitory effects on the function of wild-type Boi1-PH.
          Myr-Boi1(PH) allowed a degree of sectoring similar to
          that for Boi1-PH without the tag (Fig. 6), suggesting
          that Myr does not impair the function of Boi1-PH.
          Next, we asked whether Myr could improve the ability
          of the different mutant versions of Boi1-PH to function.
          At 23°C, 25% of colonies containing Boi1-PH(TK) without
          the tag showed moderate or heavy sectoring. This value
          rose to 81% when using the Myr-tagged version of
          Boi1-PH(TK) (Fig. 6), suggesting that Myr improves the
          ability of the TK mutant version of Boi1-PH to function.
          At 30°C, the effect of Myr was even more striking:
          without the tag, only 1% of the Boi1-PH(TK) colonies
          showed any degree of sectoring; however, with the tag,
          90% of the colonies showed moderate or heavy sectoring
          (Fig. 6).
          Myr also greatly improved the ability of the KK mutant
          version of Boi1-PH to cause sectoring: Myr-Boi1-PH(KK)
          allowed 59% moderate or heavy sectoring at 23°C and
          allowed 28% moderate or heavy sectoring at 30°C, compared
          to there being no sectoring at either temperature without
          Myr (Fig. 6). At 23°C, Myr also improved the function of
          the KKTK (the most severe) mutant version of Boi1-PH: at
          this temperature, whereas Boi1-PH(KKTK) without Myr did
          not allow any sectoring, Myr-Boi1-PH(KKTK) allowed 17% of
          the colonies to show moderate or heavy sectoring (Fig.
          6). In constrast, when tested at 30°C, Myr did not affect
          significantly the amount of sectoring allowed by
          Boi1-PH(KKTK): 98% of the colonies of cells containing
          Myr-Boi1-PH(KKTK) were non-sectoring at this temperature
          (Fig. 6).
          It is unlikely that the mechanism by which Myr
          improves the function of the different mutant versions of
          Boi1-PH is by increasing their stability, because the
          presence of Myr did not have an obvious effect on the
          relative concentrations of the different versions of
          Boi1-PH (Fig. 7B).
        
        
          Localization of wild-type and mutant versions of
          Boi1 and Boi2
          To investigate whether binding to phospholipid may be
          important for proper localization of Boi1, we used GFP
          (green fluorescent protein) fusions to identify first the
          patterns of localization of wild-type Boi1 and Boi2 and
          then those of the mutant versions of Boi1 that are
          impaired in the ability to bind phospholipid. The
          micrographs in Figure 8show examples of the different
          patterns of localization observed for wild-type Boi1-GFP.
          In unbudded cells, Boi1-GFP was seen to be concentrated
          in a single spot at the cell cortex ("polar" pattern) in
          70% of the cells (Fig. 8A). In small-budded cells,
          Boi1-GFP was concentrated in the bud in 89% of the cells
          (Fig. 8B). In cells containing large buds, Boi1-GFP was
          concentrated in the bud in 50% of the cells and was
          concentrated at the neck in 31% of the cells (Fig. 8C).
          Boi2-GFP showed distributions of localization patterns
          generally similar to those for Boi1-GFP (Fig. 8A,8B,8C).
          Thus, Boi1-GFP and Boi2-GFP both appear to be localized
          to sites of polarized growth throughout the cell
          cycle.
          The KK, TK, and KKTK versions of Boi1-GFP all showed a
          polar pattern of localization in approximately half of
          the unbudded cells (Fig. 8A), suggesting that binding to
          phospholipid is not critical for this pattern of
          localization. In small-budded cells, the KK, TK, and KKTK
          mutant proteins showed localization to the bud in only
          18, 21, and 27% of the cells, respectively (compared to
          in 89% of the cells for wild-type Boi1-GFP) (Fig. 8B).
          Thus, although the KK, TK, and KKTK mutant proteins all
          were able to localize to the bud in small-budded cells,
          they were localized and/or retained there less
          efficiently than was wild-type Boi1-GFP.
          A more striking effect of the KK, TK, and KKTK
          substitutions on the localization of Boi1-GFP was seen in
          cells that contained large buds: Boi1-TK-GFP was
          concentrated in the bud in only 4% of large-budded cells,
          and Boi1-KK-GFP and Boi1-KKTK-GFP were concentrated in
          the bud in less than 1% of such cells (Fig. 8C). None of
          the sets of substitutions had an obvious effect on
          localization to the neck, however (Fig. 8C). These
          findings suggest that, in large-budded cells, binding to
          phospholipid may be important for the localization of
          Boi1 to the bud but not for localization to the neck.
          Although our studies focus on roles of Boi1's PH
          domain, we were also curious to know which other portions
          of Boi1 contribute to its proper patterns of
          localization. In particular, we wished to know whether
          either the SH3 domain or the proline-rich (Bem1-binding)
          region of Boi1 is important for any pattern of
          localization. To address this issue, we used the
          following mutant versions of Boi1: the "S" mutant, which
          contains a Lys residue in place of a Trp residue at a
          highly conserved position in the SH3 domain; the "P"
          mutant, in which seven of the nine Pro residues in the
          Pro-rich region are replaced with Ala residues (a version
          of Boi1 that does not bind Bem1); and the "SP" mutant,
          which contains both the "S" and "P" changes [ 1 ] .
          The most striking effect of the SH3-domain mutation
          was on the localization of Boi1-GFP to necks: we never
          saw Boi1-S-GFP localized to necks (Fig. 8C), suggesting
          that the SH3 domain is required for such localization. In
          constrast, the SH3-domain mutation had no obvious effect
          on the localization of Boi1-GFP to the bud in either
          small- or large-budded cells (Figs. 8Band 8C). However,
          this mutation increased the frequency of localization to
          the periphery of large-budded cells, and it did so to a
          degree that approximated that to which it caused a
          decrease in the frequency of localization to the neck: in
          large-budded cells, whereas wild-type Boi1-GFP was
          localized to the periphery of the mother part of the cell
          in only 3% of the cells and to the neck in 31% of the
          cells, Boi1-S-GFP was localized to the periphery of the
          mother in 22% of the cells (and was never localized to
          the neck). These findings raise the possibility that
          failure to localize to the neck increases the likelihood
          that Boi1 will adopt or retain localization at the
          periphery of the mother part of the cell.
          Another apparent effect of the SH3-domain mutation on
          the localization of Boi1-GFP was seen in unbudded cells,
          in which the percentage of cells that showed a polar
          pattern of localization for Boi1-S-GFP (24%) was lower
          than for wild-type Boi1-GFP (70%), and in which
          Boi1-S-GFP gave a higher percentage of cells that showed
          the diffuse pattern (62%) compared to that given by
          wild-type Boi1-GFP (24%) (Fig. 8A). These findings raise
          the possibility that one way in which Boi1-GFP acquires a
          polar distribution in unbudded cells involves prior
          localization to the neck, via the SH3 domain.
          In all classes of cells, the distributions of
          localization patterns for Boi1-P-GFP were not notably
          different from those for wild-type Boi1-GFP, and the
          distributions of localization patterns for Boi1-S-P-GFP
          were not notably different from those for Boi1-S-GFP
          (Figs. 8A,8B,8C), suggesting that the proline-rich region
          is not important for any of the observed patterns of
          localization of Boi1-GFP.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Binding to phospholipids
          Boi1-PH co-sediments with PS vesicles, suggesting that
          Boi1's PH domain can bind PS. Boi1-PH co-sediments more
          readily when such vesicles contain a small percentage
          (5%) of PIP 
          2 , suggesting that Boi1-PH also binds
          PIP 
          2 and that it does so with higher
          affinity than it binds PS. Given that PIP 
          2 and PS are negatively charged (with
          PIP 
          2 being more negatively charged than
          PS), a model to account for these binding behaviors is
          that Boi1's PH domain binds in a non-specific manner to
          negatively charged surfaces. The ability to bind
          different acidic phospholipids appears to be a fairly
          common attribute of PH domains [ 11 12 ] . For example,
          five out of ten PH domains in one study were judged to
          bind to PS with affinity similar to that for PIP 
          2 and other inositol-based
          phospholipids, suggesting that many PH domains bind
          promiscuously to negatively charged phospholipids [ 11 ]
          .
          Findings from protease-sensitivity analyses suggest
          that Boi1-PH binds in a different manner to PIP 
          2 than to PS, however. Specifically,
          proteolysis of Boi1-PH was stimulated by PIP 
          2 /PS mixed vesicles but not by
          vesicles that contained only PS. For the following
          reasons, we think that the inability of PS, by itself, to
          stimulate the proteolysis of PIP 
          2 is not due to an inability of PS to
          bind to Boi1-PH. First, the ability of PIP 
          2 to stimulate proteolysis of Boi1-PH
          was greatly enhanced when using PS (rather than PC) as
          the bulk lipid in the vesicles, suggesting that PS binds
          to Boi1-PH in this analysis. Second, the proteolysis
          analysis was conducted in conditions that were very
          similar to those used in the vesicle co-sedimentation
          analysis, in which Boi1-PH was found to bind readily to
          PS. These findings suggest that, in conditions in which
          both PS and PIP 
          2 bind to Boi1-PH, only PIP 
          2 binds in a manner that triggers the
          exposure of a protease-sensitive site.
          PIP 
          2 was not the only
          phosphatidylinositide that could stimulate proteolysis of
          Boi1-PH; PI4P also did so, although less effectively than
          did PIP 
          2 . In contrast, PI3P and PI were
          comparatively ineffective at stimulating proteolysis. The
          large difference in the ability of PI4P versus PI3P to
          stimulate proteolysis supports the view that Boi1's PH
          domain can discriminate between different phosphorylated
          versions of PI in some manner that involves more than
          simply recognizing net charge.
        
        
          Residues implicated in binding to
          phospholipid
          The KK, TK, and KKTK mutant versions of Boi1-PH
          contain substitutions at positions in the PH domain that
          were predicted to be involved in binding PIP 
          2 . PIP 
          2 /PS vesicles did not stimulate the
          proteolysis of any of these mutant versions of Boi1-PH,
          suggesting that each mutant is indeed impaired in the
          ability to associate with PIP 
          2 and/or PS.
          Vesicle co-sedimentation analyses also suggest that
          each mutant version of Boi1-PH is impaired in the ability
          to bind PIP 
          2 /PS vesicles. However, these
          analyses suggest that the KK substitutions may impair
          binding in a different manner than do the TK
          substitutions. In particular, the co-sedimentation
          analyses suggest that the TK mutant may be severely
          impaired in the ability to bind acidic phospholipids
          generally. In contrast, the KK mutant appears to be
          impaired more in the ability to recognize specifically
          PIP 
          2 than in the ability to bind
          non-specifically to acidic phospholipids.
        
        
          Significance of binding to phospholipids
          Based on colony-sectoring analyses, the KK, TK, and
          KKTK mutant versions of Boi1 are all impaired in
          function. The KK (as well as the KKTK) version of Boi1
          appeared to be completely non-functional, pointing to the
          possibility that binding specifically to PIP 
          2 (as opposed to binding to acidic
          phospholipids generally) may be critical for Boi1
          function.
          Fusion to a myristoyl group-accepting sequence
          appeared to completely restore function to Boi1-PH(TK),
          consistent with the possibility that the TK substitutions
          may affect primarily association with membrane. The
          myristoyl group-accepting sequence did not completely
          restore function to the KK and KKTK versions of Boi1-PH,
          however, raising the possibility that, rather than simply
          promoting general association with membrane, one role of
          binding to PIP 
          2 may be to regulate some other
          behavior of Boi1 (e.g., the binding of Boi1 to some other
          protein at the plasma membrane).
          If specific binding to PIP 
          2 (and/or to some other
          phosphatidylinositide, such as PI4P) is critical for Boi1
          function, then how could fusion to a myristoyl
          group-accepting sequence (i.e., to a
          membrane-localization tag) improve the function of mutant
          versions of Boi1-PH that are impaired in the ability to
          bind PIP 
          2 ? One possibility is that each of
          these mutant versions of Boi1 retains at least a slight
          affinity for PIP 
          2 and that the myristoyl group causes
          these mutant PH domains to be apposed close enough to the
          lipid bilayer to enable the residual PIP 
          2 -binding activity to now be
          sufficient for binding to PIP 
          2 . We speculate that, just as binding
          to PS may serve to position the PH domain of wild-type
          Boi1 near the plasma membrane in a manner that
          facilitates binding to PIP 
          2 , the myristoyl group may help to
          situate the PH domain of the mutant versions of Boi1-PH
          at the plasma membrane in a manner that facilitates
          binding to PIP 
          2 .
          Although the myristoyl group-accepting sequence
          improved the ability of the KK mutant version of Boi1-PH
          to function, it failed to improve the function of the
          corresponding mutant version (KK) of full-length Boi1.
          This finding is consistent with the possibility that the
          ability of the myristoyl group to improve function to a
          version of Boi1 that is impaired in the ability to bind
          phospholipids may depend on the myristoyl group being
          near enough to the PH domain to be able to promote a
          close association with membrane of specifically the PH
          domain portion of the protein.
        
        
          Localization of Boi1
          A behavior of Boi1 that is affected by mutations that
          impair binding to phospholipids is the localization of
          Boi1 to buds. These mutant versions of Boi1 still
          localize to mother/bud necks, however. In contrast, a
          mutation in the SH3 domain prevents Boi1 from localizing
          to necks, but it does not diminish the ability of Boi1 to
          localize to buds. These findings suggest that binding to
          phospholipids may promote the localization of Boi1 to
          (and/or the retention of Boi1 at) the bud, but that this
          binding is not important for the localization of Boi1 to
          the neck.
          How might binding to phospholipids promote
          localization of Boi1 to buds? One possibility is that the
          relevant phospholipid(s) (e.g., PIP 
          2 ) is itself concentrated in buds.
          Another possibility is that the binding to phospholipid
          promotes the binding of Boi1 to some other protein that
          is itself localized to buds. Other than the unidentified
          protease that acts on Boi1 in yeast extracts, the only
          proteins that we have evidence for binding to Boi1 are
          Bem1 and Cdc42, both of which show localization patterns
          similar to those for Boi1 ( [ 20 21 ] , and our
          unpublished data). Amino-acid substitutions in the
          proline-rich stretch of Boi1 that destroy binding to Bem1
          do not affect the localization of Boi1, suggesting that
          binding to Bem1 is not necessary for any pattern of
          localization of Boi1.
          The situation with respect to Cdc42 is less clear. We
          have not yet generated mutations in 
          BOI1 that would allow us to probe
          the role of Boi1's interaction specifically with Cdc42.
          However, we have observed that the two-hybrid interaction
          between Boi1-PH and Cdc42 is not reduced by substitutions
          (i.e., KK, TK, and KKTK) that impair binding to
          phospholipids. These findings suggest that binding to
          phospholipid is not necessary for the interaction between
          Boi1 and Cdc42, and so place in doubt the possibility
          that the mechanism by which binding to phospholipid
          promotes localization of Boi1 to buds is by positively
          regulating the binding of Boi1 to Cdc42. We note,
          however, that these two-hybrid analyses may be quite
          limited in terms of what they can reveal about
          interactions between Boi1 and Cdc42 that might normally
          occur at the plasma membrane (or at other membranes),
          because 1) the two-hybrid assay monitors only those
          interactions that are occurring in the nucleus and 2) in
          these two-hybrid analyses, we used only versions of Cdc42
          that lack a site of isoprenylation (because we were
          unable to detect two-hybrid interactions between Boi1 and
          versions of Cdc42 that retain that site). Thus, it is
          still possible that at the plasma membrane, binding to
          one or more types of phospholipid influences Boi1's
          ability to associate with Cdc42. Alternatively,
          phospholipids might regulate the binding of Boi1 to some
          other, as-yet unidentified binding partner of Boi1. To
          us, an important breakthrough toward elucidating the role
          of the binding of any phospholipid to Boi1 would be the
          identification of a protein whose binding to Boi1 is
          regulated by that phospholipid.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        From vesicle co-sedimentation and
        proteolysis-stimulation analyses, we gained evidence that
        the PH domain of Boi1 binds with higher affinity to PIP 
        2 than to PS and that binding to PIP 
        2 is facilitated by PS and promotes a
        conformational change in Boi1. Amino-acid substitutions
        that diminish binding to PS and PIP 
        2 impair Boi1 function, and fusion to a
        myristoyl group-accepting sequence improves the ability of
        these mutant versions of Boi1-PH to function, suggesting
        that binding to phospholipids is important for Boi1 action.
        Based on the differing extents to which the myristoyl
        group-accepting sequence improved the ability of the
        different mutant versions of Boi1-PH to function, we
        propose that the main role of binding to PS is to promote
        association with membrane and that binding to PIP 
        2 plays some additional important role.
        Boi1 and Boi2 are localized to sites of polarized growth,
        consistent with the view that they are involved in
        polarized growth. Whereas the SH3 domain is needed for
        localization of Boi1 to the neck, the phospholipid-binding
        portion of the PH domain is important for localization to
        the bud.

          Generation of lipid vesicles
          PC and PS were stored dissolved in chloroform at
          concentrations of 20 and 10 mg/ml, respectively.
          Inositol-based phospholipids were stored at 1 mg/ml
          dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of chloroform:methanol. Lipids
          (pure or mixtures) were dried down from these solutions
          under a stream of nitrogen gas. Bath-type sonication was
          then used to generate suspensions of vesicles of these
          lipids in PBS.
        
        
          Proteolysis assay
          The wild-type, KK, TK, and KKTK versions of Boi1-PH

          were expressed in yeast strain Y312 under the control of
          the 
          GAL10 promoter from plasmids
          pPB900, pPB1308, pPB1699, and pPB1755, respectively.
          Cultures were grown to an O.D. 
          600 of 0.8 in 250 mls of SC-Leu,
          pelleted, suspended in 250 mls of Sgal-Leu, and incubated
          at 30°C for 16 hours. The following procedures were then
          performed at 4°C. Cells were pelleted, and the pellets
          were rinsed with PBS containing all of the protease
          inhibitors except leupeptin, benzamidine, and EGTA. Cells
          were suspended in PBS containing the same protease
          inhibitors and were then lysed using a French press.
          Large pieces of cellular debris were removed by
          centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min in a Sorval SS34
          rotor. Soluble fractions were then generated by
          centrifugation of lysates at 541,000 × g for 1 hr in a
          TLA 100.4 rotor in an Optima TLX ultracentrifuge
          (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). To the cytosolic fractions
          (supernatants), glycerol was added to a final
          concentration of 40%. These fractions were stored at
          -20°C and used within one month. 15 μl of 1 mg/ml lipid
          vesicle/PBS suspension was mixed with 15 μl of cytosol. 5
          mM DTT was included to inactivate any residual PMSF, and
          then 2 mM CaCl 
          2 was added to allow proteolysis of
          Boi1-PH. Reaction mixtures were then transferred
          immediately to a 30°C water bath, and proteolysis was
          inhibited 5 min later by addition of an equal volume of
          2× SDS sample buffer containing 2 mM EGTA. Proteins were
          separated by SDS-PAGE through a 12% gel, and then
          proteins were transferred electrophoretically to
          Immobilon P membrane. Blots were probed with anti-Boi1
          antibody AP-PH. Antibody-bound protein bands were
          detected on X-ray film using ECL. Each of the proteolysis
          experiments was performed at least three times, with
          similar results.
        
        
          Vesicle co-sedimentation assay
          Yeast cytosol (from 541,000 × g spins) containing
          wild-type and mutant versions of Boi1-PH were prepared
          and stored as described for the proteolysis assay, except
          that the protease inhibitors leupeptin, benzamidine, and
          EGTA were included. 15 μl of 1 mg/ml lipid vesicle/PBS
          suspensions were mixed with 15 μl of cytosol. 30 μl of
          PBS, with or without additional KCl, was then added to
          each mixture to reduce the concentration of glycerol to
          approximately 10%. For the experiment shown in Fig. 3,
          the concentrations of additional KCl in the final
          reaction mixture are indicated. For the experiment shown
          in Fig. 5B, no additional KCl was present. Mixtures were
          then centrifuged immediately at 436,000 × g for 1 hr in a
          TLA100 rotor. Supernatants were combined 1:1 with 2× SDS
          sample buffer, and pellets were dissolved in 2× SDS
          sample buffer. Equal proportions of each fraction were
          subjected to SDS-PAGE through a 12% gel, proteins were
          transblotted Immobilon P membrane, blots were probed with
          antibody AP-PH, and bound antibodies were detected by
          ECL. Each of the vesicle co-sedimentation experiments was
          performed at least three times, with similar results.
        
        
          Colony-sectoring assay
          Plasmids were introduced into strain PY967 using the
          lithium thiocyanate procedure [ 23 ] , and transformants
          were selected on SC-Ura. Concentrations of plasmid DNAs
          were adjusted so that they would give approximately 400
          colonies per petri plate. Transformation plates were
          incubated at either 23 or 30°C for 4-5 days and then
          stored at 4°C for one week to allow further development
          of the red color. To assay sectoring, colonies were
          viewed using a low-power dissecting microscope. A minimum
          of 200 colonies were analyzed for each plasmid tested at
          each temperature.
        
        
          Analysis of relative protein concentrations
          To analyze versions of full-length Boi1, 
          boi1 strain Y1284 was used,
          selecting for plasmids in SC-Ura. To analyze versions of
          Boi1-PH, strain PY967 was used, selecting for plasmids in
          SC-Ura-Leu. Cultures were grown to an O.D. 
          600 of 0.8 at 23°C and then diluted
          1:1 with 0.4 M NaOH + 1.7% 2-mercaptoethanol. The
          resulting lysed-cell suspensions were then incubated on
          ice for 10 min, and protein was made to precipitate using
          10% trichloroacetic acid. Pellets were rinsed first with
          70% ethanol and then with acetone, and they were then
          suspended in 1% SDS + 3 M urea. Protein concentrations
          were determined using the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce,
          Rockford, IL). 10 μg of total protein from each sample
          was subjected to SDS-PAGE through a 12% gel. Proteins
          were transblotted to Immobilon P membrane, blots were
          probed with antibody AP-101, and bound antibodies were
          detected by ECL. Each of the analyses of protein
          concentration was performed three times, with similar
          results.
        
        
          Localization studies
          Yeast strain Y1300 was used for localization studies.
          Cells were grown in SC-Ura to select for plasmids that
          encode the GFP fusions. Aliquots of cells from
          exponentially growing cultures were placed directly
          (without centrifugation) onto glass slides for analysis
          using a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope. No
          slide sample was analyzed for longer than 5 min, to avoid
          stressing the cells. Quantification of the different
          localization patterns was done separately for each
          morphological category (i.e., analyzing first only
          unbudded cells, then only small-budded cells, and then
          only large-budded cells). Cells in which the diameter of
          the bud was less than 1/4 of the diameter of the mother
          part of the cell were classified as small-budded cells.
          For each experiment, we analyzed at least 100 cells in
          each morphological category, scoring only cells that gave
          detectable green fluorescence. Figure 8shows the average
          values from the results of three such experiments. In
          some large-budded cells, but in no case more than in 3%
          of such cells, green fluorescence was seen both at the
          neck and at the mother periphery. Such cells were placed
          in the "neck" rather than in the "peripheral" category.
          Images were captured using a MicroMAX digital camera
          system and WinView/32 software (Princeton Instruments
          Inc., Trenton, N.J.). Images were processed using
          Photoshop 5 software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose,
          CA).
