        A plethora of circumstantial evidence implicates
        downregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
        inhibitor p27 in prostate cancer. While greater than 85% of
        terminally differentiated secretory cells in normal human
        prostate display strong nuclear staining for p27, all cases
        of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, invasive
        carcinoma, and pelvic lymph node metastases studied by
        DeMarzo 
        et al. showed down-regulation of p27
        [ 1 ] . In addition, low p27 expression correlates with
        higher mean Gleason scores, a number of prognostic
        morphological features, and decreased survival [ 2 3 4 ] .
        Thus, p27 may be a prostate tumor suppressor.
        In support of this notion, the p27 protein has been
        identified as a target of viral oncoproteins [ 5 6 ] .
        However, unlike traditional tumor suppressors, the p27 gene
        rarely shows homozygous inactivation in cancer cells [ 7 8
        9 ] , a finding that points towards alternative mechanisms
        of p27 inactivation.
        p27 specifically inhibits CDKs, which mediate entry into
        S phase [ 10 11 ] . The level of p27 is higher in quiescent
        than in proliferating cells, and this increase in p27
        abundance is required for an effective cell cycle exit [ 12
        ] . The cell cycle-dependent variations in p27 levels are
        not reflected by similar changes in p27 mRNA [ 13 ] . Many
        aggressive prostate cancers display decreased p27 protein
        levels in the presence of high p27 mRNA [ 14 ] , suggesting
        that p27 depletion may result from ectopic proteolysis. In
        fact, p27 depletion in several cancers was shown to result
        from increased proteolysis via the ubiquitin/proteasome
        system [ 15 16 17 18 ] .
        This system employs a cascade of enzymatic reactions
        that covalently attach a ubiquitin chain to substrate
        proteins, thereby targeting them to the proteasome [ 19 ] .
        The ubiquitin transfer reaction involves three enzymes: E1,
        which mediates the ATP-dependent activation of ubiquitin,
        and E2, or ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (UBC), which,
        together with an E3 ubiquitin ligase, transfers ubiquitin
        to the target protein.
        Biochemical studies identified SCF SKP2, an E3 that
        mediates p27 ubiquitylation 
        in vitro [ 20 21 ] . This complex
        consists of at least four proteins: SKP1, CUL1, HRT1
        (=RBX1/ROC1), and SKP2. SKP2 contains a so-called F-box,
        which mediates binding to SKP1, and C-terminal leucine-rich
        repeats that recognize p27. CUL1, in turn binds to SKP1,
        and together with HRT1, mediates the interaction with the
        ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme CDC34/UBC3. CKS1, a small
        protein that associates with CDKs and greatly stimulates
        p27 ubiquitylation, was recently identified as a forth SCF
        SKP2component [ 22 23 ] .
        Two rate-limiting steps for p27 ubiquitylation were
        defined: (1.) phosphorylation of p27 by CDK2 at threonine
        187 [ 24 25 26 ] , and (2.) binding of phosphorylated p27
        to SKP2 [ 20 21 ] . SKP2 is down-regulated in resting cells
        with stable p27, but strongly up-regulated in cells, which
        progress into S phase [ 27 28 ] . In some tissue culture
        cells, overexpression of SKP2 is sufficient to induce p27
        degradation and S phase entry [ 29 30 31 32 ] , and can
        cooperate with 
        ras in transformation [ 33 34 ] .
        Significantly, overexpression of SKP2 has been observed in
        many cancer cell lines [ 28 35 ] as well as in primary
        cancer specimens and many of these tumors also display
        down-regulation of p27 [ 33 36 37 38 ] .
        Here, we used the androgen-sensitive human prostate
        cancer cell line LNCaP [ 39 ] as a model system to address
        the role of SKP2 in androgen-mediated cell cycle control.
        This cell line undergoes reversible G1 arrest in response
        to androgens [ 40 41 42 43 44 ] . The G1 arrest is
        accompanied by p27 upregulation [ 42 43 45 ] , however the
        pathway leading to p27 upregulation is unknown. We show
        that androgen-induced p27 upregulation is paralleled by p27
        stabilization and SKP2 downregulation. SKP2 overexpression
        is sufficient to overcome androgen-mediated p27
        accumulation, indicating that it is a major mediator of
        androgen-mediated cell cycle control.
      
      
        Results
        
          Androgen-induced G1 arrest correlates with
          inhibition of cyclin E kinase activity
          Consistent with our previous studies, the synthetic
          androgen 7α-17α-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone (mibolerone,
          MIB) inhibits the proliferation and suppresses the
          transformed phenotype of LNCaP cells ( [ 46 ] and Fig.
          1A). No cytotoxic or apoptosis-inducing activity was
          associated with this growth inhibition ( [ 46 ] , and
          data not shown). To determine whether MIB caused arrest
          in a particular phase of the cell cycle, MIB treated
          cells were examined by flow cytometry. MIB induced a
          time-dependent accumulation of cells in G1 at the expense
          of both S and G2/M phases (Fig. 1B). Consistent with G1
          arrest, MIB induced inhibition of cyclin E-associated H1
          kinase activity (Fig. 1C). This inhibition correlated
          with increased recovery of the CDK2 inhibitor p27 in
          cyclin E immunocomplexes isolated from MIB-treated LNCaP
          cells (Fig. 1D). Similar finding were previously obtained
          with the synthetic androgen R1881 and the natural
          androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) [ 42 43 ] . The latter
          study also showed that p27 is quantitatively bound to
          cyclin E complexes in DHT-treated cells, indicating that
          p27 upregulation was sufficient to saturate and inhibit
          cyclinE/CDK2 complexes [ 43 ] .
        
        
          MIB-induced cell cycle arrest and CDK2 inhibition
          coincide with upregulation of p27 and downregulation of
          SKP2
          Consistent with increased recovery of p27 in cyclin E
          complexes, MIB caused a concentration and time-dependent
          increase in steady-state p27 protein levels (Fig. 2A,2B).
          This increase was reversible, as p27 levels were
          gradually restored to near control levels after removal
          of MIB and addition of a 500-fold molar excess of the
          antiandrogen cyproterone acetate (CA) (Fig. 2Cand 2D).
          Simultaneous administration of MIB and CA partially
          prevented p27 accumulation, indicating that it was
          mediated by the androgen receptor (AR) (Fig. 2D).
          Since the level of SKP2 is a rate-limiting determinant
          of p27 levels [ 20 21 29 ] , we examined the effect of
          MIB on SKP2 protein levels. SKP2 levels were
          down-regulated nearly four-fold by MIB at concentrations
          and with kinetics that closely paralleled p27
          accumulation (Fig. 2A,2B). In addition, downregulation of
          RB1 and accumulation in the underphosphorylated form
          paralleled SKP2 down-regulation (Fig. 2A). In contrast,
          only minor changes were detected in the expression of the
          SKP2-associated SCF SKP2subunits HRT1, CUL1, and SKP1
          (Fig. 2A). MIB-dependent SKP2 down-regulation was
          efficiently counteracted by CA (Fig. 2Cand 2D), again
          indicating an involvement of the AR. Cyclin A, but not
          cyclin E levels were also suppressed by MIB in an
          AR-dependent manner, while the levels of the
          COP9/signalosome subunit CSN5/JAB1 and tubulin remained
          constant (Fig. 2D). Finally, consistent with SKP2 and p27
          being integral components of androgen-mediated growth
          control of LNCaP cells, CA also efficiently reversed the
          MIB-induced G1 cell cycle arrest (Fig. 2E).
          To confirm the effect of MIB on p27 and SKP2 at the
          level of individual cells, we performed
          immunofluorescence staining. In untreated controls, most
          cells displayed strong staining for SKP2 with few cells
          positive for p27 (Fig. 2F). The nuclear staining patterns
          of SKP2 and p27 appeared mutually exclusive. (Fig. 2F).
          In contrast, the majority of MIB-treated cells showed
          strong p27 expression, while only few cells were positive
          for SKP2.
        
        
          MIB-induced p27 upregulation correlates with
          increased p27 protein stability and decreased
          ubiquitylation
          Northern blot analysis revealed that MIB-induced SKP2
          downregulation at the protein level is reflected by
          quantitatively similar changes in steady state RNA levels
          (Fig 3A). In contrast, p27 mRNA levels were upregulated
          by MIB only two-fold (Fig. 3A). This suggested that the
          effect of MIB on p27 RNA levels can not fully account for
          the accumulation of p27 protein (compare Figs. 2Band
          3A)
          We therefore determined the effect of MIB on p27
          half-life. Protein synthesis was inhibited by
          cycloheximide in control cells and in cells pretreated
          with MIB for 72 h. Cells were harvested after various
          times and the effect on p27 protein levels was assessed
          by immunoblotting. Using this assay, we determined a p27
          half-life of 4 h in control cells, which was increased to
          more than 6 h in MIB treated cells (Fig. 3B). This
          experiment likely overestimates p27 half-life in
          untreated cells, as SKP2 was itself downregulated by CHX
          (data not shown). Nevertheless, the data suggest that p27
          upregulation in response to MIB is partially mediated by
          changes in protein stability.
          To confirm this conjecture, we used an 
          in vitro assay to determine p27
          ubiquitylation activity in LNCaP cell lysate. Similar to
          previously described protocols [ 21 22 30 ] , cell
          lysates were prepared by hypotonic lysis of untreated
          LNCaP cells or cells treated with MIB for 96 h.
          Ubiquitylation substrate was prepared by 
          in vitro transcription and
          translation of p27 in the presence of 35S-methionine. A
          point mutant of p27 (p27T187A), in which the critical
          CDK2 phosphorylation site in position 187 was replaced by
          alanine [ 24 ] was also prepared. Both substrates were
          incubated with recombinant cyclin E/CDK2 complexes in the
          presence of ATP, ubiquitin, and LNCaP cell lysate.
          Conversion of p27 into polyubiquitylated high molecular
          weight species was monitored by autoradiography of
          35S-labeled p27 following gel electrophoresis.
          Polyubiquitylation of wildtype, but not mutant p27 was
          observed in untreated LNCaP cell lysate (Fig. 3C). This
          activity was completely abolished in MIB-treated cells
          (Fig. 3C), suggesting that p27 accumulation results from
          reduced p27 ubiquitylation.
        
        
          Overexpression of SKP2 induces F-box-dependent p27
          ubiquitylation
          Considering the inverse correlation between p27 and
          SKP2 protein levels, we asked whether ectopic SKP2 can
          forge p27 down-regulation in LNCaP cells. To test this,
          we generated recombinant adenoviruses driving the
          expression of SKP2 (Ad-SKP2) or a mutant of SKP2 lacking
          the F-box (Ad-SKP2-ΔF). Infection of asynchronous LNCaP
          cells with SKP2 virus led to time-dependent
          downregulation of p27 (Fig. 4A).
          To determine whether SKP2 downregulation is a
          necessary step in MIB-induced p27 upregulation, LNCaP
          cells were blocked with MIB for 72 h, followed by
          infection with Ad-SKP2 or Ad-SKP2-ΔF for various periods.
          Immunoblotting revealed that SKP2 overexpression can
          efficiently downregulate p27 levels in the continuous
          presence of MIB (Fig. 4B). In contrast, overexpression of
          F-box deleted SKP2 did not result in a decline of p27
          (Fig. 4B).
          To determine whether SKP2 induces p27 ubiquitylation,
          cell lysate was prepared from MIB-exposed cells infected
          with Ad-SKP2 and Ad-SKP2-ΔF, and supplemented with
          phosphorylated p27, ATP, and ubiquitin. SKP
          overexpression for 24 or 48 h dramatically increased p27
          ubiquitylation activity present in these cell lysates
          (Fig. 4C, lane 5 and 7). This increase was not observed
          with mutant p27T187A as substrate and upon overexpression
          of SKP-ΔF (Fig. 4C, lanes 9 and 11).
        
        
          Overexpression of SKP2 is not sufficient to
          overcome androgen-mediated G1 arrest
          To test whether SKP2-mediated p27 degradation is
          sufficient to overcome the MIB-induced G1 cell cycle
          arrest, LNCaP cells were arrested with MIB for 72 h,
          followed by infection with SKP2 adenovirus. Cells were
          harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry after various
          periods. The mutant SKP2-ΔF was used as a negative
          control. Although, in three independent experiments, the
          fraction of cells in S phase was significantly (p =
          0.009) higher in MIB-arrested cells overexpressing SKP2
          (7.93%, +/-0.32) than in SKP2-ΔF overexpressing cells
          (4.02%, +/-1.41) at a time when p27 downregulation was
          already apparent (24 h), the majority of cells remained
          tightly arrested in G1 over the entire 72 h course of the
          experiment (Fig. 5A).
          This finding is in contrast to serum starved rat
          fibroblasts and human U87 cells arrested in G1 by
          overexpression of PTEN, in which SKP2 overexpression can
          drive S phase entry. [ 29 30 32 33 ] . In both cases,
          SKP2 overexpression leads to induction of cyclin A and
          CDK2 kinase activity. We therefore asked whether
          SKP2-mediated p27 downregulation in MIB arrested LNCaP
          cells was able to actually bring about CDK2
          activation.
          We first determined the effect of SKP2 overexpression
          on MIB-induced RB1 downregulation and accumulation in the
          dephosphorylated state (see Fig. 2A), which is carried
          out by CDK2 
          in vivo [ 47 ] . Immunoblotting
          revealed that RB1 suppression in the hypophosphorylated
          state was efficiently reversed by SKP2 overexpression for
          24 or 48 h (Fig. 5B). In addition, cyclin A expression
          was partially restored (Fig. 5B). However, both effects
          were largely annihilated after 72 h of SKP2
          overexpression. In contrast, cyclin E levels, while not
          initially affected by MIB, were decreased after 72 h of
          SKP2 overexpression (Fig. 5B). In contrast, CDK2 and
          tubulin levels remained stable at all time points of SKP2
          overexpression (Fig. 5B).
          A parallel experiment, revealed that CDK2 kinase
          activity assayed 
          in vitro using histone 1 as
          substrate was suppressed by MIB, but partially restored
          by overexpression of SKP2 for 24 and 48 h (Fig. 5C, left
          panel). This increase was paralleled by a decrease in the
          amount of p27 associated with cyclin E (Fig. 5C, right
          panel). While this decrease was maintained throughout the
          course of the experiment, CDK2 activation was attenuated
          again at 72 h of SKP2 overexpression. In summary, SKP2
          overexpression caused transient upregulation of cyclin A
          expression and CDK2 activity, but was inefficient in
          promoting S phase entry of MIB-arrested LNCaP cells.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Androgen control of LNCaP cell proliferation
          We have used the cell line LNCaP as a model to examine
          the role of SKP2 in androgen control of p27 expression
          and cell cycle progression in human prostate cancer
          cells. LNCaP cells exhibit a complex, but characteristic
          biphasic response to androgens: (1.) Stimulation of
          proliferation at low androgen levels, and (2.) inhibition
          of proliferation at higher levels such as those used in
          this study [ 41 ] . This dichotomy was compared [ 43 ] to
          the situation in male rodents, where castration leads to
          atrophy of the prostate due to apoptosis.
          Re-administration of androgen induces transient
          epithelial cell proliferation, presumably mediated by
          proteolytic downregulation of p27, until pre-castration
          cell numbers have been restored [ 48 49 ] . No further
          proliferation ensues beyond this point, at which p27
          levels are increased again, despite the continuous
          presence of androgen. This may reflect androgen activity
          in restoring the glandular structure by promoting
          postmitotic differentiation [ 48 49 ] . Consistent with
          this view, androgen administration to intact rats
          resulted in suppression of prostate epithelial cell
          proliferation and maintenance of morphological gland
          integrity [ 50 ] . Based on these findings, we propose
          that the effects of high doses of androgens on SKP2 and
          p27 in LNCaP cells described here reflect a
          differentiation and consolidation effect 
          in vitro . If this is the case,
          LNCaP cells, despite being highly aneuploid derivatives
          of a metastatic lesion of an advanced cancer [ 39 ] , may
          have retained some aspects of the normal biphasic
          mechanism of androgen control observed in castrated
          rodents. This mechanism may also be retained in other
          prostate cancers, thereby representing a potential target
          for intervention.
        
        
          Role of SKP2 in androgen control of p27
          stability
          Our data indicate that SKP2 is an integral component
          of androgen control in LNCaP cells, as it is
          down-regulated in an AR-mediated manner (Fig. 2Band 2C).
          In contrast, all other known SCF SKP2subunits examined
          were largely unresponsive to androgen (Fig. 2A).
          Importantly, SKP2 overexpression is sufficient to reverse
          androgen-mediated p27 accumulation and induce p27
          ubiquitylation (Fig. 4Band 4D). Based on the F-box
          dependency of these processes (Fig. 4C), we conclude that
          SKP2 directly triggers the ubiquitylation and degradation
          of p27 in LNCaP cells, a process which is attenuated by
          androgen-mediated SKP2 downregulation. This
          interpretation is consistent with SKP2 being a proximal
          element in the previously identified androgen-mediated
          pathway of cell cycle inhibition in LNCaP cells. As a
          direct consequence of SKP2 downregulation, p27 is
          upregulated and cyclin A is downregulated. This results
          in inhibition of CDK2 activity, accumulation of
          hypophosphorylated RB1, inactivation of E2F1 [ 45 ] , and
          cell cycle arrest.
          While it may surprise that SKP2 overexpression alone
          is sufficient to mediate p27 degradation in LNCaP cells,
          given the known requirement for p27 phosphorylation [ 24
          ] , similar observations were made in rat fibroblasts,
          human U87 cells, and primary rat hepatocytes [ 29 30 31
          32 ] . In rat fibroblasts, these findings correlate with
          SKP2-induced upregulation of cyclin A and CDK2 kinase
          activity [ 29 32 ] , which could further augment p27
          phosphorylation and degradation, ultimately stimulating
          cells to enter S phase.
          Unlike in rat fibroblasts and human U87 cells [ 29 30
          32 ] , SKP2 overexpression is not sufficient to override
          androgen-induced G1 arrest in LNCaP cells, despite a
          profound effect on p27 levels (Fig. 5). Consistent with
          this finding, ectopic SKP2 expression was not sufficient
          to maintain high cyclin A levels, CDK2 activation, and
          RB1 phosphorylation for prolonged periods (Fig. 5Band
          5C). The transient character of these responses may
          explain the failure to cause efficient S phase entry in
          the presence of MIB, in particular as co-expression of
          cyclins was previously shown to synergize with SKP2 in
          stimulating CDK2 activity and S phase entry [ 30 31 ] .
          In addition, cyclin A is frequently overexpressed in
          prostate cancers [ 51 ] . In future experiments, it will
          be interesting to determine the effect of combined
          overexpression of SKP2 and cyclin A and cyclin E on cell
          cycle progression of MIB-arrested cells.
          Regardless of the outcome of such experiments, our
          data firmly suggest that SKP2 is a central mediator of
          the androgen response mechanism of LNCaP cells. However,
          we do not believe that SKP2 is a direct transcriptional
          target of the AR, as the kinetics of its downregulation
          were rather slow (Fig. 2A), suggesting several
          intermediate steps culminating in this event. Such a
          mediator could be AS3, a gene induced by growth
          inhibiting levels of androgen with kinetics that precede
          cell cycle arrest [ 52 ] . In addition, AS3
          overexpression mimics androgen-mediated cell cycle arrest
          in MCF7 cells stably expressing exogenous AR, while
          anti-sense AS3 confers resistance to androgen-induced
          growth arrest [ 53 ] . The function of AS3 is still
          unknown, but the encoded protein has features of a
          potential transcription factor [ 53 ] .
          While our study suggests that SKP2 is an important
          player in p27 regulation in prostate cancer cells, recent
          studies have also implicated another protein, CSN5/JAB1,
          in p27 regulation [ 54 55 ] . CSN5 is a subunit of the
          COP9/signalosome (CSN) complex [ 56 57 58 59 ] , but also
          forms distinct complexes apparently lacking CSN subunits
          [ 55 60 61 62 ] . Overexpression of CSN5 in NIH3T3 cells
          causes p27 export from the nucleus and ectopic
          degradation [ 54 ] . Notably, like SKP2 [ 33 36 37 38 ] ,
          CSN5 was found to be overexpressed in cancers devoid of
          p27 [ 63 ] . However, our studies did not reveal any
          effect of MIB on CSN5 expression. Future studies aimed at
          eliminating CSN5 activity will show whether it is
          involved in androgen-mediated p27 control.
          Finally, a recent report demonstrated SKP2-independent
          proteolysis of p27 in lymphocytes derived from SKP2
          knockout mice [ 64 ] . It is thus possible that p27
          proteolysis is subject to tissue-specific regulation. In
          prostate cells, however, SKP2 seems to be a major
          determinant of p27 degradation, as it is down-regulated
          by androgen and its overexpression is sufficient to
          mediate p27 ubiquitylation and degradation. Recent
          studies involving androgen administration to castrated
          rats have come to similar conclusions [ 49 ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our data suggest that androgen-mediated SKP2
        downregulation is responsible for decreased ubiquitylation
        and accumulation of p27 in LNCaP cells, an effect that is
        readily overcome by overexpression of SKP2. We propose that
        frequent p27 downregulation in prostate cancer may be
        caused by SKP2 overexpression thus enabling escape from
        normal androgen control. Finally, our 
        in vitro studies validate the SKP2
        pathway as a potential target for therapeutic intervention
        in cancers devoid of p27.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Plasmids and reagents
          Human SKP2 and p27 cDNAs were kindly provided by H.
          Zhang (Yale University) and P. Jackson (Stanford
          University). The genes were amplified by PCR and cloned
          into pcDNA3 enabling 
          in vitro transcription. The SKP2
          mutant lacking the F-box was constructed using the
          Quickchange kit purchased from Stratagene. Probes for
          Northern blotting were generated by PCR. The GAPDH probe
          was generated by reverse transcription and PCR from LNCaP
          m RNA.
          The synthetic androgen mibolerone
          (7α-17α-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) was purchased from
          Perkin Elmer Life Sciences. The antiandrogen cyproterone
          acetate was a gift from C. Sonnenschein (Tufts
          University). The reagents were dissolved in absolute
          ethanol.

          immunoblotting).
        
        
          Tissue culture
          LNCaP-FGC cells were obtained from ATCC (order number
          CRL-10995) and maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10%
          FBS as described [ 46 ] . We noticed that LNCaP cells at
          low density grow best on 15 cm Falcon 3025 tissue culture
          dishes and that the effects of SKP2 overexpression were
          most pronounced when cells were cultured on these dishes
          (data not shown).
        
        
          Adenoviruses
          For production of adenoviruses, the ADEASY system was
          used (generously provided by B. Vogelstein). The complete
          SKP2 cDNA or a mutant lacking the F-box (SKP2-ΔF) were
          cloned into a modified pcDNA3 plasmid providing an
          N-terminal Myc epitope tag and the human lamin B leader
          sequence. The lamin B-SKP2 cassette was removed and
          cloned into the pADTRACK1 shuttle vector. The resulting
          plasmid was transformed into BJ-ADEASY cells by
          electroporation. Adenoviral DNA generated by
          recombination in BJ-ADEASY cells was isolated.
          Recombinant adenoviral DNA was transfected into 293 cells
          using standard calcium phosphate procedures. Virus was
          harvested from cells and amplified by infection of 293
          cells. Amplified virus was purified by cesium chloride
          gradient centrifugation and tittered. An approximate
          multiplicity of infection of 100 was used throughout.
        
        
          Immunological techniques
          Cell lysates for immunoblotting were prepared by
          scraping cells into heated 2 × SDS sample buffer. Samples
          were boiled for 10 min, centrifuged, and separated by SDS
          gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto
          Immobilon P membrane (Millipore), blocked in 5 % nonfat
          dry milk dissolved in tris-buffered saline / 0.1 % Tween
          and probed with the various antibodies.
          Cell lysates for immunoprecipitation were prepared in
          IP-LB (25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 % Triton
          X100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mM PMSF,
          17 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were scraped into IP-LB and
          incubated on ice for 30 min. Cell lysate was cleared by
          centrifugation and the supernatant was incubated with
          various antibodies (see plasmid and reagents section
          above). Immunocomplexes were collected on protein A or G
          beads, washed five times in IP-LB for 5 minutes each,
          dissolved in 2 × SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS
          gel electrophoresis.
          For immunofluorescence staining, LNCaP cells were
          plated onto poly-lysine coated glass coverslips. Cells
          were fixed in 4 % para-formaldehyde in PBS and
          permeabilized by washing in PBS / 0.1 % Triton X100.
          Coverslips were blocked in PBS / 0.1 % Triton X100
          containing 5 % nonfat dry milk for 45 min. Incubation
          with primary and secondary antibodies was in the same
          buffer for 45 min each. After antibody incubations,
          coverslips were washed five times in PBS / 0.1 % Triton
          X100, followed by mounting on microscopy slides.
          Micrographs were taken with a Spot CCD camera mounted on
          a Nikon E600 epifluorescence microscope. Brightness and
          contrast of the images was adjusted in Adobe Photoshop
          5.0.
        
        
          Northern blotting
          Isolation of total cellular RNA using a urea/LiCl
          protocol and gel electrophoresis was performed as
          described previously [ 65 ] . Gels were transferred onto
          Amersham Hybond N+ nylon membranes in 20 × SSC and
          prehybridized in 4 × SSC, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5%
          SDS for 2 h at 68°C. Complementary DNA fragments for
          SKP2, p27, and GAPDH were amplified by PCR and
          radiolabeled by random priming. Filters were hybridized
          for 16 h at 68°C followed by washing in 2 × SSC at 68°C.
          Membranes were exposed to X-ray film for 2 to 12 h and
          scanned with a phosphoimager for signal quantitation.
        
        
          H1 kinase assay
          Histone 1 kinase assays with cyclin E or CDK2
          immunoprecipitates were performed as described [ 65 ]
          .
        
        
          In vitroubiquitylation assay
          Cell lysates for ubiquitylation assays were prepared
          by hypotonic lysis on ice in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 15 mM
          MgCl 
          2 , 5 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 10 μg/ml
          leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mM PMSF, 17 μg/ml
          aprotinin as described previously [ 30 ] . Lysates were
          cleared by centrifugation and used without prior
          freezing. Radiolabeled wildtype and T178A point mutant
          p27 were produced by combined 
          in vitro transcription and
          translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing
          35S-methionine. The 
          in vitro translated proteins were
          incubated 2 h at 30°C in the presence of 1 mM ATP with
          recombinant cyclin E / CDK2 complexes produced from
          baculoviruses in insect cells. Aliquots of phosphorylated
          proteins were added to a reaction containing 120 μg cell
          lysate, recombinant human E1, 0.25 mg/ml ubiquitin, 1 μM
          ubiquitin aldehyde, 1 μM okadaic acid, 20 μM MG132, and
          ATP regenerating system (20 mM ATP, 10 mM creatine
          phosphate, 0.1 μg/ml creatine kinase). After 90 min, the
          reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer,
          and reaction products were separated by SDS gel
          electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography.
