        Control of gene expression is central to all cellular
        processes. Transcription factors (TFs) often function in
        networks, in which a regulatory protein controls the
        expression of another, which in turn may modulate the
        expression of other regulatory loci, or control genes
        encoding structural proteins or enzymes. These hierarchical
        arrangements allow specific signals to be amplified, and
        provide the information necessary for given sets of genes
        to be deployed with particular space and temporal patterns.
        Thus, an emerging theme in regulation of gene expression is
        the identification of regulatory networks in which TFs
        participate to specify the temporal and spatial expression
        of all genes in an organism. A first step in making this
        possible is the identification of the entire complement of
        TFs and the corresponding 
        cis -regulatory elements in the
        promoters of all genes.
        The completion of the sequencing and annotation of the
        entire 
        Arabidopsis genome [ 1 ] has provided
        a unique opportunity to start exploring the regulatory
        networks present in plants. TFs are usually classified
        according to the presence of conserved DNA-binding domains
        [ 2 ] . The DNA-binding domain is responsible for
        recruiting TFs to specific 
        cis -regulatory DNA sequences in the
        promoters of the genes they regulate. In 
        Arabidopsis , previous studies
        identified about 1,500 TF genes grouped into more than 34
        families [ 3 ] . Some of these families are specific to the
        plant kingdom or have dramatically expanded in the plants,
        compared to the animals (e.g. MYB and WRKY), suggesting
        that they may participate in regulatory networks unique to
        the plants. Other families are much larger in animals, as
        for example the homeo-domain family. Only a small fraction
        (~200) of the 1,500+ 
        Arabidopsis TFs have been genetically
        characterized, and direct target genes for TFs (i.e. genes
        to which TFs bind and activate) have been identified in
        just a handful of those cases. Despite the general interest
        in investigating the function of all 
        Arabidopsis genes by year 2010
        http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2001/nsf01162/nsf01162.html, and
        the knowledge on the number and classification of 
        Arabidopsis TFs [ 3 ] , no resource
        is currently available to obtain all the 
        Arabidopsis TF sequences or
        information on their possible binding sites. While several
        resources are available to search for putative 
        cis -regulatory motifs in a DNA
        sequence, no initiative has been taken in carrying out this
        process at a genome-wide level. For example, PlantCARE
        http://oberon.rug.ac.be:8080/PlantCARE/index.html, a 
        cis -regulatory element database for
        plants, contains information about 435 different plant TF
        binding sites in 159 promoters. From these 435 binding
        sites, 281 correspond to dicots. Clearly, this information
        is just a fraction of the total 
        cis -regulatory regions present in 
        Arabidopsis .
        In the quest to determine Arabidopsis TF function and
        establish the regulatory networks that control the
        expression of all Arabidopsis genes, the development of a
        web-based resource that divides TFs into families and
        allows the rapid download of any Arabidopsis TF sequence
        and the fast identification of mutants, linked to the
        possible sequences to which these TFs may bind in the
        Arabidopsis genome is of pressing urgency. Providing these
        resources and starting to link TFs to target genes is the
        basic motivation behind the development of AGRIS. Here we
        describe AGRIS, constituted by AtTFDB and AtcisDB. AtTFDB
        is a downloadable database of 1,375 
        Arabidopsis TF sequences with
        information on available mutations in the corresponding
        genes. As information on the expression patterns of TFs is
        generated, the information will be added to AtTFDB. The
        first release of AtcisDB (AtcisDB 1.0) contains an
        annotation of the promoter sequences for all 27,975
        annotated 
        Arabidopsis genes. AtcisDB is linked
        to AtTFDB when binding sites for specific transcription
        factors have been identified. Together, AGRIS provides a
        first step in establishing the regulatory networks that
        regulate the expression of all Arabidopsis genes.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Information Server
          (AGRIS)
          AGRIS integrates data from a variety of different
          sources (see Methods section). AGRIS currently consists
          of two integrated databases, AtTFDB and AtcisDB.
        
        
          AtTFDB Database
          AtTFDB consists of a collection of Arabidopsis TF
          sequences (protein and DNA) grouped by family.
          Information on the TFs can be viewed through two portals:
          (i) by browsing the various families to get a complete
          list of TF genes in that family, or (ii) by searching for
          a specific gene by locus ID (in AtXgXXXX format), or
          using any word found in the description or family name.
          For each gene found through the search, a description is
          given and links are provided to display additional search
          results from TIGR, MATDB, SALK, and TAIR. Nucleotide or
          amino acid sequences for individual TF, for entire
          families or for the entire collection can be directly
          downloaded in FASTA format. There are also links to
          complete alignments, Hidden Markov Models and Motifs
          files of each family for direct download.
          A previous analysis of the complete 
          Arabidopsis thaliana genome
          sequence suggested the presence of about 1500 TFs with
          recognizable motifs [ 3 ] . A search of the TAIR website
          http://www.arabidopsis.orgindicated that very few TF
          sequences can be retrieved using a search with the key
          words "transcription factor" or "regulatory protein". In
          addition, only two TF families (MYB & WRKY) were
          identified and listed within the "gene family page"
          http://www.arabidopsis.org/info/genefamily/genefamily.html.
          Thus, to identify TFs, a combination of BLAST and motif
          searches was used based on the available literature on
          known TFs, or on motifs conserved among TFs from a
          family. A few smaller families were identified directly
          from published literature (i.e.CCAAT-Dr1 & E2F-DP).
          Many families were found through a domain search and
          blast technique. Publications were found through PubMed
          and the conserved domain motif that characterizes each TF
          family was identified. Using the motif, a Blast was
          conducted in the TAIR website, the resultant sequences
          were then aligned and mismatches were discarded. Another
          approach, especially for large families where very few
          TFs had been identified, was an iterative Blast approach.
          A few representative proteins were used to perform a
          Blast on the TAIR website. The resultant sequences with
          an E-value smaller than 10 -5were considered a good
          match, then the last sequence was used in a subsequent
          Blast, and so forth until all similar sequences were
          identified, then they were aligned, and any mismatched
          sequences were discarded. There are some discrepancies
          between the previously estimated number of transcription
          factors per families from Riechmann et al. and those
          listed on AGRIS. These may be explained due to further
          genome refinement after the December 2000 publication or
          because of our more stringent analysis, although we
          continue to add more transcription factors on a daily
          basis. After identifying the sequences, a script
          performed an automatic gathering of information from
          public online repositories using the list of gene names
          to populate the database. This database was curated
          semi-automatically by discarding duplicated entries,
          unknown genes and outliers, the last ones being
          identified by hand looking at the alignments of the
          sequences of each individual family. In addition,
          transcription factors that were not readily aligned with
          a family, but have been documented and studied were
          placed together in the appropriately named "Orphans
          Family". The results included 1375 transcription factors,
          which were subsequently placed into one of 34 TF
          families. The breakdown of transcription factors into
          families and the queries used for their identification is
          shown in Table 1.
        
        
          AtcisDB Database
          AtcisDB is an integrated database of promoter
          sequences with annotations of 
          cis -regulatory elements. The
          current version of AGRIS contains only 5' promoter
          regions, binding sites have also been identified in 3'
          regions and introns, but they are limited in number and
          for the time being not represented. Users can search
          AtcisDB for a specific gene promoter or the direct target
          genes of a specific transcription factor. The current
          database version, At 
          cis DB 1.0, consists of promoter
          sequences of 29,388 annotated genes. The length (L)
          distribution of these promoter sequences are: 5,759
          sequences have L = 500 nt, 5,322 have 500<L = 1000 nt,
          6,761 have 1000<L = 2000 nt and the rest have
          2000<L = 3000 nt. Nearly 4% of the annotated genes are
          located in head-to-head direction sharing bi-directional
          promoters of length less than 500 nt. The transcriptional
          regulation of such genes being organized as bidirectional
          gene pairs and what distinguishing them from other
          unidirectional promoter genes is mostly unclear.
          One of the main features of At 
          cis DB is mapping of experimentally
          known and computationally predicted (see Methods for
          details) TF binding sites to their respective gene
          promoters, and display in graphical form. To date the
          website contains mainly predicted binding sites, but by
          August 1, 2003 the goal is to integrate experimentally
          proven binding sites highlighted to show their
          significance. In addition, a web page is being developed
          that will provide a complete list of transcription factor
          binding sites and a reference for each. While the
          experimentally known 
          cis -regulatory information is
          rather limited, the use of high throughput micro-array
          expression studies in recent times have generated
          transcript profiles of 
          Arabidopsis genes so as to infer
          the functions of known and putative TFs. Chen 
          et al. [ 4 ] have showed that the
          promoter sequences of genes responsive to different
          treatments are enriched with known TF binding sites for
          those responses. They also identified a novel promoter
          motif in genes responding to a broad set of pathogen
          infection treatments. Klok 
          et al. [ 5 ] identified genes
          involved in low-oxygen response to 
          Arabidopsis root cultures by using
          cDNA microarray experiments, with similar sequence motifs
          in the promoters of genes with similar expression
          profiles. Similar studies [ 6 7 8 ] found common binding
          sites in the promoter regions of genes responsive to
          various conditions. AGRIS will be complemented by
          extensive searches of publicly available microarray
          expression data to include all such information about TFs
          and their regulatory motifs present in their target gene
          promoters.
          We also provide a web page at our database, where the
          users of At 
          cis DB can report back any of the
          validated annotations of At 
          cis DB from their experiments. This
          facilitates the generation of a draft-annotated version
          of At 
          cis DB.
        
        
          Database Queries, Visualization and Analysis
          Tools
          A Web interface for AGRIS has been developed using the
          J2EE technology (JSP and Servlet). Users can search the
          database and retrieve the promoter sequence, and
          annotation information of a specific gene in several
          ways. For example, users can use a gene name or gene
          symbol to search and retrieve the promoter of a specific
          gene and a set of genes regulated by the same
          transcription factor (Web Figure 1). A typical search
          result for a specific promoter, using Promoter Id (same
          as corresponding Gene Id of TAIR), is listed in Table 2.
          The table has seven entries, which are Promoter Id
          (unique id for each promoter), Site Name (the
          transcription factor binding site name represented by
          transcription factor name), Gene Symbol and Gene
          Description (detailed information for gene symbol and
          gene description for that promoter). In order to further
          organize the database information, we provide two links
          for Promoter Id entry and Gene Symbol entry. The detailed
          visualization and annotation table can be obtained by
          clicking the link on Promoter Id entry. Users can also
          access the promoter gene annotation by clicking the links
          on Gene Symbol entry.
          Web Figure 2shows a graphical organization of the
          regulatory regions for each promoter. We used in-house
          developed Genome Data Visualization Toolkit (GDVTK; Sun
          & Davuluri, submitted for publication;
          http://bioinformatics.med.ohio-state.edu/GDVTKfor
          providing graphical view of the annotations. A line with
          small arrow indicates the position of the predicted or
          experimentally demonstrated transcription start site;
          (TSS). A set of small color squares represent the
          transcription factor binding sites, when the user move
          the mouse on these colored squares, a contextual menu
          will pop out and show the detailed information for that
          binding site. The user has the ability to zoom in or out
          of the promoter sequence and see the gene symbol for that
          promoter, and binding site information with relative
          position to TSS and their DNA sequence. The sequence of
          the promoter can be obtained by clicking the link on Get
          Promoter Sequence.
        
      
      
        Methods
        
          Implementation of AGRIS
          
            1. Locating Promoter Sequence on Arabidopsis
            Genome
            We downloaded the annotated coding sequences and the
            chromosomal sequences from ftp://ftp.tigr.org(updated
            April 17, 2003). We mapped the coding sequences to the
            chromosomal sequences by BLAT [ 14 ] . Then, for each
            gene, if the upstream intergenic region is greater than
            3 kb, we retrieved the sequence upstream of ATG of
            length 3 kb. Otherwise, we consider that intergenic
            region as promoter of the downstream gene, to exclude
            any coding region of upstream genes. We will repeat
            this process immediately after the release of every new
            annotation by TIGR so that the promoter sequences in
            AtcisDB are based on latest annotations.
          
          
            2. Generation of a map of cis-regulatory
            sequences for all Arabidopsis promoters
            We have collected consensus-binding sequences for
            known transcript factors from literature and maintain
            that information as a database in AtTFDB. We are
            providing a draft annotation of At 
            cis DB 1.1 by computational
            methods. We have developed computer programs to scan
            the promoter sequences in At 
            cis DB for transcription factor
            binding sites based on one of the following two
            approaches: 
            (a) Scanning for consensus binding
            sites: AtTFDB contains the TFs and their consensus
            binding sites. We have developed Perl scripts to scan
            the promoters for consensus binding site occurrence. 
            (b) Position Weight Matrix Methods
            (PWM) to scan known binding sites: We have prepared
            position-weight matrices [ 15 ] of those 
            Arabidopsis transcription factors
            for which at least 5-10 experimentally known binding
            sites exist. While the number of 
            Arabidopsis TFs with these
            properties is still small, it is rapidly growing. PWMs
            have been used to estimate the likelihood that a given
            sequence binds to a specific TF [ 16 ] . If a PWM
            exists for a TF, we follow approach (b). Otherwise
            approach (a) is carried out. We are refining these
            annotations by combining information from the AtTFDB
            database.
          
        
        
          Database schema
          The database schema AtcisDB and AtTFDB are shown in
          Figures 2and 3. Six tables are used to store the promoter
          sequence and their cis-regulatory element annotation
          information.
          • BindingSite table stores the transcription factor
          binding site's information.
          • TransFacInfo table stores the data of the
          transcription factor information associated with binding
          site table.
          • PromoterSeq stores the data for promoter
          sequence.
          • GeneInfo stores the data of the gene annotation for
          each promoter.
          • PromoterInfo stores the coordinate information of
          the promoter mapped on genome and relative information
          for promoter annotation.
        
        
          Web interface
          A web interface was developed to allow user
          interaction with the information in the databases. The
          web pages were developed using JavaServer Page (JSP)
          technology, because of its rapid development and easy
          maintainability qualities in development of
          dynamically-generated web pages and takes advantage of
          the java technology provided by the Apache Tomcat server
          http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat. Figure 4contains a
          simplified diagram revealing the interaction of the
          different components behind the AGRIS online resource.
          The result is a unified public domain online resource
          consisting of all the currently identified Arabidopsis
          TFs, with regular updates to the database as additional
          data is discovered.
