        The complete sequencing of several genomes, including
        that of the human, has signaled the beginning of a new era
        in which scientists are becoming increasingly interested in
        functional genomics; that is, uncovering both the
        functional roles of different genes, and how these genes
        interact with, and/or influence, each other. Increasingly,
        this question is being addressed through the simultaneous
        analysis of hundreds to thousands of unique genetic
        elements with microarrays. Already, analytical strategies
        have subdivided into distinct 'omic' domains, such as
        genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. This enables
        researchers to examine not only genetic elements, but also
        the corresponding proteins and metabolites derived from
        these genes. All 'omic' technologies share the need for
        fresh, innovative looks at data analysis. To date,
        transcriptomics is the most widely studied molecular
        approach, enabling researchers to examine subtle
        differences in thousands of mRNA levels between
        experimental samples, medical biopsies, 
        etc . Although mRNA is not the end
        product of a gene, the transcription of a gene is both
        critical and highly regulated, thereby providing an ideal
        point of investigation [ 1 2 ] . Development of microarrays
        has permitted global measurement of gene expression at the
        transcript level and provided a glimpse into the
        coordinated control and interactions between genes.
        Presently, two technologies dominate the field of
        high-density microarrays: cDNA arrays and oligonucleotide
        arrays. The cDNA array has a long history of development [
        3 ] stemming from immunodiagnostic work in the 1980s;
        however, it has been most widely developed in recent years
        by Stanford University (California) researchers depositing
        cDNA tags onto glass slides, or chips, with precise robotic
        printers [ 4 ] . Labeled cDNA fragments are then hybridized
        to the tags on the chip, scanned, and differences in mRNA
        between samples identified and visualized using a variation
        of the red/green matrix originally introduced by Eisen and
        colleagues [ 5 ] . The light-generated oligonucleotide
        array, developed by Affymetrix, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA),
        involves synthesizing short 25-mer oligonucleotide probes
        directly onto a glass slide using photolithographic masks [
        6 7 ] . Sample processing includes the production of
        labeled cRNA, hybridization to a microarray, and
        quantification of the obtained signal after laser scanning.
        Regardless of the array used, the output can be readily
        transferred to commercially available data analysis
        programs for the selection and clustering of significantly
        modified genes.
        Differentially expressed genes will be defined herein as
        gene data determined to be statistical outliers from some
        standard state, and which can not be ascribed to chance or
        natural variabilty. Various creative techniques have been
        proposed and implemented for the selection of
        differentially expressed genes; however, none have yet
        gained widespread acceptance for microarray analysis.
        Despite this, there remains a great impulse to develop new
        data analysis techniques, partly driven by the obvious need
        to move beyond setting simple fold change cut-offs which
        are out of context with the rest of the experimental and
        biological data at hand [ 8 9 10 11 ] . This has been the
        case for many studies, where the selection of differential
        gene expression is performed through a simple fold change
        cut-off, typically between 1.8 and 3.0. There is an
        inherent problem with this selection criterion, as genes of
        low absolute expression have a greater inherent error in
        their measured levels. These genes will then tend to
        numerically meet any given fold change cut-off even if the
        gene is not truly differentially expressed. The inverse
        also holds true, where highly expressed genes, having less
        error in their measured levels, may not meet an arbitrary
        fold-change cut-off of 2.0 even when they are truly
        differentially expressed [ 12 ] . Therefore, selecting
        differentially regulated genes based only on a single fold
        change across the entire range of experimental data
        preferentially selects lowly expressed genes [ 8 ] . This
        commonly used approach does not accommodate for background
        noise, variability, non-specific binding, or low copy
        numbers- characteristics typical of microarray data which
        may not be homogeneously distributed. Other approaches
        entail the use of standard statistical measures such as a
        student's 
        t -test or ANOVA for every individual
        gene. However, due to the cost of repeating microarray
        experiments, the number of replicates usually remains low,
        leading to inaccurate estimates of variance [ 8 ] .
        Furthermore, due to the low number of replicates, the power
        of these "gene-by-gene" statistical tests to differentiate
        between regulated and non-regulated genes also remains very
        low.
        The present article describes a model that considers
        both expression levels and fold changes for the
        identification of significant differentially expressed
        genes. This simple model allows the experimenter to
        estimate the relationship between these two parameters in
        the absence of large numbers of experimental replicates,
        where the inherent error of measures cannot be accurately
        estimated. Subsequently, gene transcripts determined to be
        outliers from the trend can be considered differentially
        expressed genes. An added strength to the model lies in its
        ease of application to any data set. This model should be
        considered a progressive and cyclical process, where the
        data analyst can quickly and globally identify a list of
        potentially differentially regulated genes with confidence,
        based on the inherent qualities of the data set under
        evaluation.
        The model presented herein was developed with a data set
        from a nutritional experiment in a mouse model using
        Affymetrix Mu11K chips, where the effects of four diets
        were compared in a number of organs (pool of five mice for
        each sample in each organ): (1) control diet A in duplicate
        from the same pool; (2) diet B; (3) diet C; and (4) diet D.
        Details of the dietary treatments will be reported
        elsewhere. The present article will take only the data from
        the liver as an example for the development of a gene
        selection model. The model was validated by real-time
        polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and indicates good
        concordance between the two experimental techniques.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Selection of differentially regulated genes and
          data analysis
          The method developed herein includes: (A)
          determination of the upper X% of highest fold changes
          within narrow bins of absolute expression levels in order
          to generate a limit fold change (LFC) function; and (B)
          subsequent ranking of genes by a combined fold
          change/absolute expression calculation. The following
          discussions describe the development of the model within
          the context of our nutritional study; however, a generic
          protocol can be found in the Materials and Methods
          section.
        
        
          (A) Selection of the upper X% of highest fold
          changes within binned absolute expression levels
          The principal parameter for gene expression data
          stemming from a typical Affymetrix experiment is the
          average difference intensity (ADI), which is a
          representation of the absolute expression of a gene. As
          indicated in the literature, it is common practice to
          establish a minimal expression threshold below which data
          are considered to be noise. In the case of Affymetrix
          data, it is often necessary to discard minimal and
          negative ADIs, as these data are both biologically and
          mathematically difficult to interpret.
          A number of previous reports have used an ADI
          threshold ( 
          A 
          
            t 
           ) value of 20 in the standard Affymetrix range [ 13
          14 15 16 ] , 
          i.e. probe sets with ADI's of less
          than 20 would either be rejected or set to 20 as
          meaningful differences in gene expression can purportedly
          be evaluated above this level. Although empirically
          supported, an 
          A 
          
            t 
           of 20 is essentially an arbitrary selection and not
          all groups select the same threshold value. The exact
          setting of this lower 
          A 
          
            t 
           is not inherent to the LFC modeling process, and the
          reader is encouraged to set the 
          A 
          
            t 
           value based on additional criteria, such as that
          previously published by Gerhold 
          et al . [ 17 ] and Dieckgraefe 
          et al . [ 18 ] . However, an 
          A 
          
            t 
           of 20 will be used in the present work, for which
          the selection of differentially expressed genes in the
          context of ADI dependent variance is the central focus.
          Therefore, all ADI's less than 20 were set to 20 and any
          probe set with a value of 20 across all dietary
          treatments were discarded. After eliminating the probe
          sets which met these criteria there remained 9391 genes
          out of the original 13179 genes represented on the Mu11K
          GeneChip.
          An additional parameter, highest fold change (HFC),
          was then applied to these remaining genes. HFC is defined
          as:
          
          where A, B, C, and D represent the individual
          microarray results for each gene. The HFC is inherently a
          ratio metric of the maximum change in measured gene
          expression between any combination of experimental
          treatments. The present experiment has four dietary
          conditions with microarray data; however, it should be
          noted that the HFC equation could be expanded to any
          number of conditions or experimental treatments.
          The determination of HFC is highly influenced by
          absolute expression, and trends can be readily observed
          in our data set where HFC is negatively correlated with
          absolute expression (Figure 1a). For example, with
          absolute expression values greater than 5000 it is of low
          probability to observe an HFC greater than 2. However,
          with absolute expression values near 50, an HFC of
          greater than 2 is readily seen. Although not shown in
          Figure 1a, this trend could be observed for any pair or
          triplet of experimental comparison in the current data
          set, 
          i.e. AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, ABC, BCD.
          It has also been observed across multiple experiments
          examined in our laboratory (data not shown). This
          consistancy can be explained by the fact that there are
          very few genes out of the entire transcriptome which are
          differentially expressed due to treatment. Therefore,
          most measured gene transcripts display a typical
          coefficient of variation independent of treatment. The
          few genes which are differentially expressed do not
          unduly affect the overall trend. Therefore, the trend
          lends itself to characterization and may be used as a
          metric for determining differential gene expression
          across multiple experiments.
          This empirically implies that natural variation,
          expressed here as HFC, tends to be much greater at low
          expression levels. This concept is supported in the
          literature [ 12 ] and questions the appropriateness of
          using a linear fold change cut-off in a system
          characterized by heterogenous variance.
          As stated previously, the selection of differentially
          expressed genes is essentially a search for outliers, 
          i.e. gene data lying outside some
          standard distribution of differences relative to a
          control state, and which cannot be ascribed to chance or
          natural variabilty. To determine those genes which are
          outliers, it is necessary to measure either the
          variability of the system or to make valid assumptions
          regarding the distribution of variability. In the present
          model we assume that: (1) as mentioned above, variability
          in the measurement of gene expression is related to the
          ADI; and (2) if a broad sampling of the transcriptome is
          measured, only a small number of genes will actually be
          outliers even in the harshest of experimental conditions.
          Assumption (1) is a fairly general analytical concept, 
          i.e. the closer data is to the
          measurement threshold, the higher the variability is in
          that measurement [ 12 19 ] . Assumption (2) appears to be
          empiricaly valid when surveying the literature for
          high-density microarray experiments which evaluate severe
          biological events, from caloric restriction [ 20 21 ] to
          apoptosis [ 22 23 ] . In these experiments [ 20 21 22 23
          ] , regardless of the gene selection method used, less
          than 5% of the total number of genes probed were
          differentially regulated. Therefore, to develop the
          present model of gene selection, the validity of
          selecting outliers was evaluated for a range of highly
          variable genes using the top 5% as a benchmark. Model
          trends were then examined from 1% to 10%.
          The model was developed by first binning gene
          expression data into tight classes across the entire
          range of absolute expression values, where genes with an
          equal absolute expression value were randomly ordered,
          and then selecting the upper 5% of HFC values for further
          consideration. Binning was carried out to divide the
          entire range of absolute expression values into bins
          containing an equal number, 
          m , of genes, where 
          m = 200. Therefore, bin widths
          (ADI) were not necessarily equal, yet the number of genes
          contained in each bin was equivalent. For the first round
          of analysis, the upper 5%, or 95 thpercentile, of HFC
          genes in each bin were selected for further consideration
          (Figure 1a). It was possible to search separately for the
          5% of genes with the greatest HFCs in each class;
          however, in order to simplify the overall selection, we
          plotted the relationship between absolute expression,
          defined as min ADI (A,B,C,D), and HFC, in order to set
          the LFC function. Herein, the min ADI (A,B,C,D) will
          simply be referred to as min ADI. This relationship was
          then modeled using a simple equation of the form 
          LFC = a + (b/min ADI) , which is
          fitted to the 95 thpercentile of each bin (Figure 1a) to
          produce the LFC curve that best models the expression
          data. This modeled LFC curve (5% LFC model = 1.74 +
          91.55/min ADI) fit the data well (R 2= 0.98) and further
          analysis indicated the residuals were randomly
          distributed (data not shown). The equation for the line
          of best fit contains two parameters that have various
          repercussions on gene selection, both of which can be
          defined in commercially available software using common
          "solve" functions ( 
          e.g . Microsoft Excel). First, 
          a sets the asymptote, which
          corresponds to the minimum HFC value that can be observed
          at any given ADI. Second, 
          b raises/lowers the limit function
          at a given ADI, and is therefore highly influenced by
          this latter value. For example, the smaller the ADI the
          greater the LFC, and vice versa. Figure 1bshows that as
          the selection criteria becomes more strict (top 5% → 1%
          of genes), the curve shifts (1% LFC model = 2.43 +
          166.12/min ADI) and becomes more restrictive in the
          selection of differential genes, 
          i.e. at any given absolute
          expression level a higher fold change must be observed
          for a gene to be considered differentially expressed. The
          opposite is true when the selection criteria becomes less
          strict (top 5% → 10% of genes), where the curve shifts
          (10% LFC model = 1.59 + 69.47/min ADI) and results in a
          more permissive selection of differential genes.
          Using the aforementioned equations the selection of
          genes for further consideration becomes simple and
          'global' ( 
          i.e. across the entire range of
          expression levels); where a gene is selected with the HFC
          approach if max ADI/min ADI > a+(b/min ADI). After
          applying the 10% LFC gene filter, 869 genes remained in
          the list out of the 9391 candidate genes selected from
          the original 13179 genes on the GeneChip. When interested
          in the top 5% and 1% of significant genes, the total
          number of genes that meet the LFC requirements is 471 and
          82, respectively.
          Lastly it should be noted that the LFC, 
          i.e. the modeled trend of HFC vs.
          min ADI, is based on binned data of hundreds of genes
          across multiple conditions leading to a highly powerful
          characterization of a given threshold. In other words,
          there is a large amount of data available in order to
          accurately characterize the trend. The same argument
          holds for the generation of a modeled confidence interval
          based on low numbers of replicates, as will be described
          below. This is in contrast to the relatively low
          statistical power of conventional "gene-by-gene" tests
          such as the 
          t -test or ANOVA, often used for
          the selection of differentially expressed genes [ 8 ]
          .
        
        
          (B) Assignment of gene rank
          Following gene selection, a rank of 'importance' or
          'interest level' was assigned to each selected gene. It
          should be noted that the LFC is not dependent on the rank
          calculation; rather rank simply lends relative
          'importance' to selected genes by incorporating both the
          magnitude of fold change and absolute expression values.
          The rank number (RN) for each gene was determined by
          first calculating a rank value (RV), which can be defined
          as: RV = HFC * (max ADI - min ADI). After calculation of
          RV, gene lists were sorted and then assigned a simple RN
          of 1,2,3,4..., where a gene with a RN of 1 corresponds to
          the gene with the highest RV. The RV is an arbitrary
          value that simply lends importance to selected genes with
          both high fold changes and high differences in absolute
          expression. Both RV and RN aid in the discussion of
          differential gene effects by adding the concept of
          relative weight or importance amongst selected genes.
          This concept aids in the choice of genes for validation
          or follow-up studies, as detailed below.
        
        
          (C) Model validation
          
            Validation of the LFC model via characterization
            of measurement variability
            Hess and colleagues have recently examined the
            concept that variability and absolute expression are
            related; however, they examined only the variability of
            replicate spots on a single slide [ 24 ] . Herein, we
            extended this concept to examine the variability
            between genes on different microarrays. Measurement
            variance was examined following the development of the
            LFC model, and was therefore used simply as a
            confirmation of this model. To further understand the
            nature of measurement variability within the current
            study, duplicate Mu11K Affymetrix microarrays for the
            controls were examined (see Materials and Methods
            section). A pooled RNA sample from mice ( 
            n = 5) fed the control diet was
            hybridized to two different chips, and the data was
            analyzed to characterize measurement variability. It
            was apparent from the trend that as absolute expression
            levels (ADI) increase, the coefficient of variation
            (CV= SD/MAE) decreases. The trendline was calculated as
            detailed in the Materials and Methods section. This
            trendline was overlayed on the entire data set, in
            addition to the 5% LFC selected data (shown in red), in
            Figure 1c. By overlaying the trendline of the within
            variability data on those genes determined to be
            significantly regulated by the LFC model, the CV upper
            confidence limit for these selected genes had a 
            p value ≤ 0.001. Thus, the 5%
            LFC-selected data lies outside the 99.9% confidence
            interval surrounding measurement variability,
            reinforcing the validity of the results.
          
          
            Real-time polymerase chain reaction
            (RT-PCR)
            The results obtained from a microarray experiment
            are influenced by each step in the experimental
            procedure, from array manufacturing to sample
            preparation and application to image analysis [ 25 ] .
            The preparation of the cRNA sample is highly correlated
            to the efficiency of the reverse transcription step,
            where reagents and enzymes alike can influence the
            reaction outcome. These factors affect the
            representation of transcripts in the cRNA sample,
            necessitating the need for validations by complementary
            techniques. Analyses by northern blot and RNAse
            protection assays are commonly reported; however, the
            emerging 'gold-standard' validation technique is RT-PCR
            [ 26 ] . Microarrays tend to have a low dynamic range,
            which can lead to small yet significant
            under-representations of fold changes in gene
            expression [ 27 ] . As RT-PCR has a greater dynamic
            range, it is often used to validate the observed trends
            rather than duplicate the fold changes obtained by chip
            experiments [ 26 28 29 ] .
            Having chosen genes that lie across the range of RN,
            and therefore the range of model selection criteria,
            RT-PCR was performed in triplicate for each
            experimental condition (Diet A,B,C,D) using the same
            pooled stocks of liver RNA (5 mice per experiment).
            Genes were compared to the endogenous controls β-actin
            and GAPDH, which did not significantly change across
            the dietary treatments. As determined by our LFC
            selection model, the GeneChip microarrays indicated no
            significant differences amongst the 4 diets for either
            GAPDH or β-actin. Subsequent confirmation that both
            GAPDH and β-actin did not change was provided by
            RT-PCR, where a simple student's 
            t -test with a predefined nominal
            α level of 0.05 indicated no significant differences
            between the experimental diets (B,C,D) and the control
            diet A. RT-PCR provided a means to confirm the effects
            of the 3 dietary treatments on 9 genes (Table 1) and
            the concordance between these 27 microarray and RT-PCR
            results was examined. Perfect concordance was not to be
            expected due to the inherent differences in sensitivity
            and dynamic range between the two techniques. However,
            a good overall concordance of 77.7% for differential
            gene expression was observed, 
            i.e. the fold change for a given
            gene seen by microarray was directionally consistent
            with that seen by RT-PCR, regardless whether the
            results were significant by either the 5% LFC model
            (for microarray data) or a student's T-test (for RT-PCR
            data). When examining only those genes considered
            significantly changed by RT-PCR (α = 0.05, starred
            values in Table 1), concordance increases to 85.7%.
            Therefore, the value of 85.7% indicates the overall
            concordance between significantly changed genes seen by
            RT-PCR and those microarray pairwise comparisons
            (treatment vs. control) that meet the LFC model
            criteria (§ values in Table 1).
            What is noticeable through the color scheme (Table
            1) is genes with high RN (low RV) have relatively less
            concordance between the two techniques; where red
            indicates no concordance and blue indicates only one or
            two (out of three) of the results agreed. However, the
            majority of genes are colored in green, indicating
            perfect directional concordance. When specifically
            examining fatty acid synthase (FAS), a highly expressed
            gene, microarray fold changes of less than 2 can be
            corroborated between the two experimental techniques,
            reinforcing the strength of this fold change model.
            Furthermore, it is clear from the RT-PCR data that at
            very low expression levels, high fold changes are still
            problematic to verify and remain questionable. The
            present model takes this into account by raising the
            criteria appropriately at the low expression range, 
            i.e. a higher fold change at low
            expression levels is required for a gene to be
            considered differentially expressed.
            As the selection criteria with microarray data was
            that the HFC must be greater than the LFC model limits,
            the expectation was that the LFC function could be
            validated by RT-PCR (underlined values in Table
            1indicate HFC for each gene). This is predominantly the
            case across the full dynamic range of data selected by
            the model (77.7% / 85.7 % concordance), except for very
            lowly expressed genes such as the RAS oncogene. For
            genes with a slightly lower RN (higher RV), such as
            ABC1 member 7, some concordance is seen, indicating
            confidence is gaining as RV increases. For genes with
            an RN lower than 130 (RV > 1156; 
            e.g. USF-2) concordance quickly
            approaches 100%, indicating high confidence when
            discussing gene trends or individual gene results.
            These results reinforce the concept that RN is
            correlated with confidence and validity when discussing
            the gene set produced by the LFC model.
            Interestingly, one might expect that genes with an
            RN lower then 130 would be concentrated only at higher
            expression levels; however, when the spread of genes
            with an RN between 1-130 were examined, these genes
            were found to lie across the entire range of absolute
            expressions (data not shown). This indicates that a 5%
            LFC model is confidently selecting differentially
            regulated genes across the full range of absolute
            expression. Therefore, the 5% LFC model appears to be
            an appropriate selection criteria for the present
            experimental data set; however, the fold change
            percentage could easily be varied to meet other
            acceptable levels of risk, as is done with conventional
            hypothesis testing ( 
            e.g. α-, 
            p -, and χ 2-values). The X%
            selection criteria should then be re-evaluated for
            other experimental data sets in relation to the
            variance and validation data at hand.
          
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The analysis of microarray data is a developing field of
        study aimed at enabling the biomedical community to cope
        with the waves of large microarray data sets. Already, an
        evolution can be observed with respect to the methods for
        selecting significantly changed genes. Researchers are
        moving away from simple fold change cut-offs and
        incorporating the use of robust statistical concepts. The
        conclusion that highly expressed genes will rarely have a
        2-fold change in mRNA levels and that lowly expressed genes
        will commonly have a greater than 2-fold change led to the
        development of a model that would accommodate for this real
        biological characteristic of gene expression measurements.
        The fold change model presented in this paper considers
        both the absolute expression level and fold change of every
        gene across the entire range of observed absolute
        expressions. In addition, the concept of increased
        variation in lowly expressed genes is incorporated into the
        selection model through the higher fold change requirements
        for differential gene selection at low expression levels.
        Following gene selection using an initial criterion of X%,
        gene rank was introduced as a basis for choosing genes to
        validate the model. Therefore, a limited but judicious
        choice of model parameters to select genes across a broad
        range of gene rank can then be used to reset the X% in
        order to correspond with the data at hand (Figure 2). The
        variance data characterizing measurement variability
        supports the selection model, indicating that selected
        genes lie outside measurement variability at very high
        confidence limits (> 99.9% CL). Further validation of
        this model in the current data set by RT-PCR confirmed
        these relationships, reinforcing that genes with fold
        changes even less than 1.8 can be measured, assuming
        adequate absolute expression levels. This demonstrates that
        biological changes in sample concentration of mRNA, even at
        low fold change levels, can be confidently determined.
        In summary, the X% LFC model enables one to define
        experiment specific selection stringency while maintaining
        simplicity and ensuring global coverage for the detection
        of differential gene selection.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Mice and feeding conditions
          Mice were male Rj:NMRI mice from Elevage Janvier, Le
          Genest-Saint-Isle France, weighing 10-11 g at delivery
          and 33-51 grams on day 42, were housed 10 per cage. Mice
          received 
          ad libitum quantities of bottled
          distilled water and purified powdered diets (7.5 g/mouse)
          in ceramic cups (10/group) for 42 d. Experimental diets
          will be described in detail in a biological follow up
          publication.
        
        
          Dissection of mice
          After administration of the aforementioned diets to 10
          mice per group, 5 mice were randomly selected for
          inclusion in the gene expression analysis experiment.
          Organs were dissected according to standard protocols,
          then cut into 100-150 mg subsections, flash frozen in
          liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until gene
          expression analysis.
        
        
          Nucleic acid preparation
          Tissue from each organ was extracted from 5 individual
          mice and extracted separately using Qiagen RNeasy
          mini-kits (Basel, Switzerland) according to
          manufacturer's instructions with one exception: During
          extractions, all RNeasy columns were impregnated with
          DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) to remove possible
          genomic DNA contamination. After extraction, equal
          amounts of material were pooled to obtain 10 μg total RNA
          per dietary group. RNA samples were quantified with the
          RiboGreen RNA Quantification Kit according to
          manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes, Eugene
          Oregon), and then analyzed via agarose gel
          electrophoresis for intact 18 and 28s rRNA. All samples
          included in the study were judged to contain high-quality
          RNA in sufficient amounts for hybridization.
        
        
          Gene expression analysis using the murine 11k
          GeneChip
          
            cRNA preparation
            Total RNA (15 μg) was used as starting material for
            all samples. In all cases, a "test chip" provided by
            the manufacturer was run prior to using the Murine 11k
            GeneChip. In each case this confirmed that sufficient
            high quality RNA was present to detect gene expression
            in the various tissue samples. The first and second
            strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the
            SuperScript Choice System (Life Technologies) according
            to manufacturer's instructions, but using oligo-dT
            primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase binding site.
            Labeled cRNA was prepared using the MEGAscript, 
            In Vitro Transcription kit
            (Ambion). Biotin labeled CTP and UTP (Enzo) was used
            together with unlabeled NTP's in the reaction.
            Following the 
            in vitro transcription reaction,
            unincorporated nucleotides were removed using RNeasy
            columns (Qiagen).
          
          
            Array hybridization and scanning
            cRNA (10 μg) was fragmented at 94°C for 35 min in
            buffer containing 40 mM/L Tris-acetate pH 8.1, 100 mM/L
            KOAc, 30 mM/L MgOAc. Prior to hybridization, fragmented
            cRNA in a 6×SSPE-T hybridization buffer (1 M/L NaCl, 10
            mM Tris pH 7.6, 0.005% Triton), was heated to 95°C for
            5 min, cooled to 40°C, and then loaded onto the
            Affymetrix probe array cartridge. The probe array was
            incubated for 16 h at 40° C at 60 rpm. The probe array
            was washed 10× in 6×SSPE-T at 25°C followed by 4 washes
            in 0.5×SSPE-T at 50°C. The biotinylated cRNA was
            stained with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate, 10
            g/ml (Molecular Probes) in 6×SSPE-T for 30 min at 25°C
            followed by 10 washes in 6×SSPE-T at 25°C. The probe
            arrays were scanned at 560 nm using a confocal
            laser-scanning microscope (made for Affymetrix by
            Hewlett-Packard). Readings from the quantitative
            scanning were analyzed with Affymetrix Gene Expression
            Analysis Software.
          
        
        
          A step-by-step method to apply the LFC model to an
          experimental data set
          
            1. Data handling and 2-dimensional
            visualization
            Overall, the values of all genes are compared across
            any number ( 
            p ) of experimental conditions.
            The absolute expression value of the 
            k -th gene for the 
            j -th treatment is coded Z 
            
              kj 
             . When considering any given gene, the following
            data-handling rules are applied:
            • All values below an ADI threshold ( 
            A 
            
              t 
             ) are set to 
            A 
            
              t 
             .
            • If the values for gene 
            k are 
            A 
            
              t 
             for all 
            p treatments, the gene is defined
            as not expressed and isn't considered further.
            • The absolute expression value for gene 
            k is defined as 
            min ( 
            Z 
            
            k 1 , ..., 
            Z 
            
              kp 
             ).
            • The highest fold change (HFC) of gene 
            k is defined as the
            following:
            
            When visualizing all genes on a bivariate plot
            according to absolute expression and fold change, one
            obtains a data distribution similar to that of Figure
            1a.
          
          
            2. Modeling a discrete limit fold change
            model
            The goal is to select the upper X% of genes with
            highest fold change across the entire range of
            expression levels. Therefore, the following rules are
            applied:
            • Genes are ordered according to their absolute
            expression value 
            min ( 
            Z 
            
            k 1 , ..., 
            Z 
            
              kp 
             ), where equally expressed genes are randomly
            ordered.
            • The overall expression range is divided into bins
            of different width, but containing an equal number 
            m of genes.
            • In each bin, the (1-X)-percentile fold change
            corresponding to a fold change that is exceeded by X%
            of genes in the bin is determined. For X% between 1%
            and 10%, 
            m = 200 appears to be
            suitable.
            When visualizing the (1-X)-percentile fold change in
            each bin, one obtains a data distribution similar to
            that seen in Figure 1a.
          
          
            3. Modeling a continuous limit fold change (LFC)
            model
            A continuous model is derived from the discrete one
            by relating the mean expressions of each bin with the
            corresponding (1-X)-limit fold change, using a least
            squares fit of the equation:
            (1-X)-LFC = 
            a + 
            b /Z (minimum expression)
            This equation appears to fit the data very well and,
            the interpretation of the parameters ( 
            a and 
            b ) is straightforward:
            • Parameter 
            a represents the asymptote of the
            curve. For very large expressions, the (1- 
            X )-limit fold change tends to be
            equal to parameter 
            a .
            • Parameter 
            b is proportional to the
            difference between the (1-X)-limit fold change of small
            and high expressions.
            When visualizing this continuous limit fold change
            model, one obtains a curve similar to that observed in
            Figure 1a. In addition, increasing the (1-X)-percentile
            fold change shifts the curve up the 
            y -axis and results in an
            increased stringency for gene selection, 
            i.e. fewer genes meet the LFC
            requirement (Figure 1b).
          
          
            Validation by Coefficient of Variance
            For experiments that are performed without
            replicates, the LFC-model selects genes with the
            highest between-treatment variability (previously
            defined as fold change) at any expression level. If
            replicates are available, the inherent error of
            measures, the within-treatment variability, can be
            estimated. Therefore, it becomes possible to select the
            genes with the highest ratio of
            between-treatment-variability /
            within-treatment-variability.
            In the data set that was used for illustrating the
            development of the LFC-model, duplicate measures were
            available for one of the four treatments. The
            within-treatment-variability appears to be highly
            dependent of the expression level of the gene,
            confirming the findings of Hess 
            et al. [ 24 ] .
            In order to estimate the CV without taking into
            account extreme values of the duplicate we used a
            robust estimator, represented by the following
            equation:
            
            where the χ 
            
              inverse 
             function returns the inverse of the one-tailed
            probability of the χ-squared distribution.
            Applying the CV derived from replicate sample data (
            
            eqn. 2 ) to the quadruplicate
            diet data enabled the calculation of the CV upper
            confidence level (by bins of absolute expression level)
            using the following equation:
            
            where the χ 
            
              inverse 
             function returns the inverse of the one-tailed
            probability of the χ-squared distribution.
            
            Eqn. 3 allows one to identify
            genes with a variance above measurement variability.
            This greater variability arose due to combined pool
            (biological) and treatment variabilities.
            This confidence level could be raised or lowered
            according to the level of confidence desired by
            altering the 
            p value. Therefore, modeling the
            variance data provides a complimentary method for
            examining the variation of genes across the complete
            range of absolute expression values.
            The upper 99.9% confidence limit (CL) of a robust
            estimation of the coefficient of variance (CV) for
            replicates (within-treatment variability) has been
            modeled as a function of absolute minimum expression of
            all treatments using the following model:
            Upper 99.9% CL = 
            c + 
            d /mean expression
            The selected genes are now those for which the CV of
            treatment expressions (between-treatment variability)
            is larger than this limit (Figure 1c). By overlapping
            those genes selected by the LFC model (red dots) on the
            graph indicating the 99.9% CL (blue line), one observes
            that the LFC model is considerably more restrictive
            when selecting lowly expressed genes (Figure 1c).
          
          
            Validation by real-time PCR (RT-PCR)
            A subset of differentially expressed genes were
            selected to confirm the LFC model, where genes were
            selected across the range of absolute expressions and
            with varying fold changes. Although not discussed in
            the present manuscript, a good description of the
            technique and an example of an excellent experimental
            design can be found in previous publications [ 26 30 ]
            , respectively. In brief, all genes were amplified in
            the Applied Biosystems 5700 instrument using SYBR
            ®green (Molecular Probes), a dye that binds
            double-stranded DNA. Data represented means of
            triplicates for each experimental treatment using
            pooled RNA samples ( 
            n = 5). Amplification was
            performed using an ABI 5700 machine (Applied
            Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with a hot start at
            95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for
            15 s and 60°C for 1 min for denaturation, annealing and
            elongation. Genes were normalized to either β-actin or
            GAPDH, and then experimental diets (B,C,D) were
            compared to the control diet (A). All fold changes were
            subjected to a student's 
            t -test (α = 0.05) to ensure fold
            changes observed by RT-PCR were statistically
            significant. Comparisons between microarray data and
            RT-PCR were then performed.

        e.g. two techniques determine that
        values are statistically significant and that they are both
        either positive or negative.
