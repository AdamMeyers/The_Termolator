        Cellular morphogenesis is fundamental to all
        developmental processes and is essential for cellular
        proliferation. Morphogenesis depends on the interactions of
        steady state and dynamic physical properties that allow a
        cell to deform and reform into different shapes, such as
        neuronal growth cones and columnar epithelia. Identifying
        the mechanical properties of cells that allow them to
        undergo shape changes and elucidating the molecular
        mechanisms that cells use to generate the mechanical forces
        remains the ultimate challenge of understanding cellular
        morphogenesis. One dramatic example of a process in which a
        cell reshapes itself is during the mechanical separation of
        a mother cell into two daughter cells during
        cytokinesis.
        In an animal cell, cytokinesis involves the generation
        of force in the region of the contractile ring (reviewed in
        [ 1 ] ). This was first appreciated in the 1960's when
        Rappaport demonstrated that the cleavage furrow cortex of
        echinoderm eggs produced force that was capable of bending
        a glass needle (reviewed in [ 1 ] ). Using calibrated
        needles, Rappaport directly measured the force that the
        contractile ring produced [ 2 ] . During the 1970's,
        nonmuscle myosin-II, the equivalent of the force producing
        molecule of skeletal muscle, was shown to localize to the
        region of the cleavage furrow cortex, suggesting the
        molecular basis for contractile force (reviewed in [ 1 3 ]
        ). Indeed, subsequent genetic studies revealed a nearly
        ubiquitous requirement for nonmuscle myosin-II during
        cytokinesis in organisms ranging from the cellular slime
        molds to metazoans (reviewed in [ 3 ] ).
        One appeal of studying cytokinesis as a model for
        cellular morphogenesis is its relatively simple geometry
        during normal mitotic cell divisions, which produce equal
        sized daughter cells. This theme can be modified for
        specific developmental programs such as the unequal
        cleavages of mammalian female meiosis. However, during
        standard mitosis, the mother cell may be modeled as a
        simple sphere, which is deformed in the region of its
        equator to mimic the ingression of the furrow. The furrow
        ingresses until a small intercellular bridge forms. The
        intercellular bridge is severed or resolved, resulting in
        separation of the two daughter cells. Cell division can
        then be thought of as a series of intermediate cell shapes
        (sphere, cylinder and dumbbell) that are produced along
        this pathway of cleaving the mother cell. Yoneda and Dan [
        4 ] suggested a model for cytokinesis based on Hooke's Law.
        In their model, the minimal contractile force required for
        stabilizing each of these intermediate shapes is
        proportional to the global steady state stiffness of the
        cell and is dependent on the extent of furrow
        ingression.
        A quantitation of the distribution and flux of each
        factor is essential for developing a physical model for a
        cellular activity. Myosin-II recruitment to the cortex and
        to the cleavage furrow cortex depends on the thick
        filament-state of this molecular motor [ 5 6 7 8 ] . The
        ability to form thick filaments is regulated by
        phosphorylation of three threonines near the tail of the
        long coiled-coil. When the protein is fully phosphorylated,
        it remains largely in the monomeric state; whereas removal
        of these phosphates allows the protein to assemble into
        thick filaments. Substitution of the three threonines with
        alanines produces the 3 × Ala mutant that behaves like a
        constitutively unphosphorylated myosin-II. It partially
        rescues the myosin heavy chain ( 
        mhcA ) null strain and localizes to
        the cleavage furrow cortex. A quantitative comparison of
        wild type and 3 × Ala myosin-II can help to constrain
        models about how myosin-II is recruited to the cleavage
        furrow cortex.
        In this paper, we conduct a detailed ratio imaging study
        using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled wild type and
        3 × Ala myosin-II and a soluble GFP as a volume marker. We
        determine the amount of myosin-II that is in the cleavage
        furrow cortex and monitor the flux of wild type and 3 × Ala
        myosin-II during cytokinesis. We apply the simple
        mathematical relationship proposed by Yoneda and Dan [ 4 ]
        to the geometry of dividing 
        Dictyostelium discoideum cells. By
        considering the stiffness of a 
        D. discoideum cell [ 9 10 ] , we
        estimate the minimal required force to cleave a cell as a
        function of the cell's geometry. We then consider the
        mechanical properties of myosin-II that have been measured
        using modern biophysical tools [ 11 12 13 14 ] to estimate
        how much myosin-II would be required to generate a
        particular amount of force. We find that the amount of
        myosin-II needed for cytokinesis and the amount of
        myosin-II that actually accumulates in the furrow region
        are in good agreement. This analysis provides a useful
        framework for relating the biochemical and biophysical
        properties of myosin-II to the mechanical process of
        cytokinesis.
      
      
        Results
        
          Ratio imaging Quantitatively measures GFP-Myosin-II
          dynamics
          To begin to develop a physical model for cytokinesis,
          we analyzed the changes in the distribution of wild type
          myosin-II and 3 × Ala GFP-myosin-II during the cell cycle
          using ratio imaging. This allowed us to quantify the flux
          of myosin-II during cytokinesis and to examine the role
          of heavy chain phosphorylation in this flux. Ratio
          imaging is preferred to other types of microscopy for
          determining local concentrations of a protein of interest
          because the whole cell is considered simultaneously and
          the signal is normalized to a volume indicator.
          To perform ratio imaging of GFP-myosin-II, it was
          expressed in a myosin-II heavy chain ( 
          mhcA ) mutant strain where it
          completely rescued the mutant. It was co-expressed with a
          second form of GFP fused to a nuclear localization signal
          (NLS-GFP). These two GFP variants, GFP-Vex1 and GFP-Bex1
          [ 15 ] , have distinct excitation spectra so that
          separate images can be obtained for the two fusion
          proteins and used to generate ratio images. Since NLS-GFP
          is relatively large (27 kDa), we examined the uniformity
          of its distribution by comparing it to a Texas
          Red-labeled dextran with a 4 kDa molecular weight. The
          fluoresecent dextran was introduced into the cytoplasm of
          cells expressing NLS-GFP and GFP-Myosin II by
          electroporation. Ratio images of GFP-myosin-II were
          generated using either the dextran or NLS-GFP, as marker
          of cytoplasmic volume, and the results compared. The
          myosin-II concentration in the cell cortex measured using
          NLS-GFP was 96% ± 0.63% (n = 10; all measurements are
          mean ± SEM) of that measured using the fluorescent
          dextran. This indicates that the penetration of the
          cortex by NLS-GFP was as complete as that by the dextran
          and was therefore not limited by its size. Therefore,
          this NLS-GFP is suitable as a cytoplasmic volume marker
          with the added benefit of serving as an indicator for
          cells entering mitosis [ 8 ] . The NLS-GFP was used as
          the volume indicator for all subsequent ratio-imaging
          analyses. Another requirement is that the fluorescence
          intensity remains uniform over the entire thickness of
          the sample so that the signal accurately reflects the
          volume of the sample. We examined the intensity profile
          emitted by a film of purified recombinant GFP. The
          fluorescence intensity was constant over a range of
          several μm above and below the focal plane (data not
          shown). Thus, the experimental setup is appropriate to
          determine the concentration of GFP-myosin-II in various
          compartments of a 10-μm cell. The correction of
          GFP-myosin-II images by ratio imaging makes a significant
          difference to the perceived distribution of myosin-II
          within the cell; in particular, myosin-II is more
          concentrated in the cell cortex and in the cleavage
          furrow cortex than is suggested by uncorrected
          GFP-myosin-II images alone (Figure 1). The intensities
          recorded in ratio images are proportional to local
          GFP-myosin-II concentrations and were used to measure the
          accumulation and dynamics of myosin-II distribution.
        
        
          Patterns of cortical myosin-II concentration during
          mitosis and cytokinesis
          Both wild type and 3 × Ala myosin-II had a similar
          flux during mitosis but differed in magnitude. During
          interphase, wild type myosin-II concentration in the
          total cortex was 25% ± 1.4% (n = 43) higher than in the
          cytoplasm while 3 × Ala myosin-II was 44% ± 1.5% (n = 11)
          higher in the cortex than in the cytoplasm. Entry into
          mitosis was associated with a drop in cortical myosin-II
          levels: a 9% ± 1.7% (n = 12) decrease for wild type and
          12% ± 2.3% (n = 11) decrease for 3 × Ala myosin-II
          (measured between interphase and nuclear division). This
          drop was followed by a period of relatively stable,
          depressed cortical myosin-II levels that persisted until
          nuclear division (Figure 2). This decrease may correspond
          to the mobilization of myosin-II from pre-existing
          cortical actin-myosin-II structures and may correlate
          with the redistribution of actin from the cortex to the
          cytoplasm [ 16 ] .
          Following the onset of anaphase, relative cortical
          myosin-II concentrations of both proteins rose throughout
          the periods of anaphase and cleavage furrow progression.
          They peaked close to the time of daughter cell separation
          and returned to interphase levels as the daughter cells
          returned to interphase morphology and behavior (Figure
          3).
          The relative concentrations of GFP-myosin-II were
          compared for three regions of cells undergoing
          cytokinesis: the furrow cortex, the polar cortex and the
          cytoplasm (Figure 1). Both myosin-II proteins invariably
          concentrated in the cleavage furrow cortex during
          cytokinesis, though the 3 × Ala mutant did so to a
          greater extent. GFP-myosin-II began to concentrate in the
          cortex of the presumptive furrow near the time of nuclear
          division, and it continued to rise in this region until
          the completion of cytokinesis. The peak concentration of
          wild type GFP-myosin-II was 1.8 ± 0.14 relative to the
          polar cortex and 2.0 ± 0.14 relative to the cytoplasm (n
          = 12). In contrast, the peak concentration of 3 × Ala
          GFP-myosin-II was 6.2 ± 0.36 (n = 11) relative to the
          cytoplasm and 7.5 ± 0.49 (n = 11) relative to the cortex
          at the poles. After separation of the daughter cells, the
          concentration of both myosin-II proteins inherited by
          their posterior ends declined but remained elevated over
          polar concentrations for several minutes.
        
        
          Conversion of the concentration ratios into real
          fractional amounts of total myosin-II at different stages
          of cytokinesis
          To convert the concentration ratios into real amounts
          of myosin-II, the volumes of each of the cellular
          compartments (cleavage furrow cortex, total cortex and
          cytoplasm) were calculated (Table 1). To do this, we
          modeled the cell in three shapes: a sphere at early
          anaphase, a cylinder with two spherical caps at late
          anaphase, and a dumbbell with spherical cap domains
          connected by a cylindrical intercellular bridge. Then, by
          considering that the total amount of myosin-II in the
          cell is 100%, the percentage of myosin-II in the furrow
          can be calculated at any point during division. Even
          though there is little or no volume change during
          cytokinesis, it should be noted that modeling the cell as
          these simple shapes does not yield perfect agreement in
          the total calculated volumes between each stage. The
          volume of the sphere appears 11% less than the volume of
          the cylinder while the volumes of the cylinder and
          dumbbell are within 3% of each other. This is probably
          because the cell is resting on a surface so that in the
          "spherical" stage it is not perfectly spherical. As the
          cell shape becomes more complex in the subsequent stages,
          the divergence from the ideal shapes is less significant
          and so the calculated volumes are much closer. In either
          case, this result does not affect our ability to
          determine how much myosin-II is in each compartment
          because the concentrations are calculated based on the
          volume of that particular shape (stage). The summary of
          these calculations is presented in Table 1where every
          concentration ratio is reflected as percentages of total
          myosin-II.
          From this analysis, it becomes apparent that about 75%
          of the total myosin-II (wild type and 3 × Ala) remains
          cytoplasmic in interphase and throughout cytokinesis.
          During cytokinesis, both wild type and 3 × Ala myosin-II
          increase in total cortical myosin-II by 29%
          ((27%-21%)/21%) and 25% ((30%-24%)/24%), respectively.
          This is reminiscent of the 26% increase in total surface
          area expected if a spherical cell conserved its volume
          during cytokinesis and could simply reflect passive
          accumulation as a result of the increase in the surface
          area to volume ratio. During cytokinesis, the amount of
          wild type myosin-II in the cleavage furrow cortex peaks
          at the time when the cell is the most cylindrical prior
          to the ingression of the cleavage furrow. At this point,
          there is about 8.4% of the cell's myosin-II (about 1 × 10
          5hexameric monomers) localized to the cleavage furrow
          cortex. Although the concentration of myosin-II in the
          cleavage furrow cortex increases as cytokinesis
          progresses to completion, the amount of myosin-II
          decreases. This is due to the furrow cortex volume
          decreasing as cytokinesis progresses. 3 × Ala myosin-II
          shows a different trend. During cytokinesis, the protein
          progressively accumulates in the furrow cortex until the
          cell completes division, indicating that heavy chain
          phosphorylation normally facilitates removal of wild type
          myosin-II from the contractile ring.
        
        
          Where does the cleavage furrow cortex myosin-II
          originate?
          Through this analysis (Table 1), it becomes apparent
          that only a few percent of the total cellular myosin-II
          has to move to account for the observed distributions.
          The first movement occurs between interphase and the
          spherical stage (onset of nuclear division) in which 2%
          of the total wild type and 3% of the total 3 × Ala
          myosin-II are released from the cortex to the cytoplasm.
          From the spherical stage to the cylindrical stage the
          amount of total cortical myosin-II remains constant. For
          wild type myosin-II, if the cortical protein were evenly
          distributed in the total cortex, 6.5% of the protein
          would already exist in the region of the furrow cortex
          with similar amounts in each polar cortex. To get the
          8.4% that are observed at the furrow cortex, 2% of the
          total cellular myosin-II must move to the furrow cortex
          region. Approximately, 1% of total cellular myosin-II
          departs from each polar cortex (approximately 13% of the
          total in the polar cortex), suggesting that the flux of
          myosin-II may be from the polar cortices to the cleavage
          furrow cortex. Similar types of movements are observed
          for the 3 × Ala myosin-II. To begin, 7% of the 3 × Ala
          myosin-II would be expected at the furrow cortex if the
          total cortical 3 × Ala myosin-II were evenly distributed.
          Then, an additional 6% of the cell's 3 × Ala myosin-II is
          recruited to the furrow cortex at the expense of the
          polar cortex.
          As the cell progresses from the cylindrical stage to
          the dumbbell stage, the amount of wild type myosin-II in
          the cortex increases from 21% to 27% of the total
          cellular myosin-II. The concentration of myosin-II in the
          polar cortex increases by 10% while the concentration in
          the furrow cortex increases by 26%. This indicates that
          the total cortex gains myosin-II but the furrow cortex
          gains myosin-II at a faster rate. Similarly, the amount
          of 3 × Ala myosin-II localized to the cortex also
          increases from 24% to 30% of the total cellular
          myosin-II. However, in this case, the polar cortex
          actually decreases its concentration of myosin-II by 18%
          while the furrow cortex increases its concentration by
          250% during this interval. Thus, for the transition from
          the cylinder to dumbbell stage, the flux of wild type and
          3 × Ala myosin-II must come largely from the cytoplasm to
          the cortex and myosin-II is recruited into the furrow
          cortex at the expense of the polar cortex. One way to
          think of these results is that myosin-II might diffuse
          into the new cortex volume as the cell increases its
          surface area and myosin-II in the thick filament form is
          then recruited to the furrow cortex.
        
        
          Estimation of the minimal force requirements for
          cytokinesis
          To relate the amount of cleavage furrow myosin-II to
          the potential forces that might be generated by the
          cleavage furrow cortex, we estimated the minimal force
          requirements for cell cleavage using the simple
          mathematical relationship proposed by Yoneda and Dan [ 4
          ] . While oversimplified, the results from this analysis
          provide a basic framework for conceptualizing the meaning
          of our quantitative distribution and flux analyses. To
          justify applying the Yoneda and Dan equation (equation 1;
          Materials and Methods), certain assumptions must be met.
          One assumption is that the volume is conserved during
          cell division. Greenspan [ 17 ] described the theoretical
          cell shape changes that occur if conservation of cell
          volume is maintained. In this regime, the region of the
          cortex proximal to the cleavage furrow will constrict
          while the polar cortex expands. The proximal and distal
          regions intersect, producing stationary rings. We
          overlaid sequential images of a dividing cell and indeed
          stationary rings are observed (Figure 4A). It can be seen
          that the cross-sectional diameter of the emerging
          daughter cells remains relatively constant if drawn where
          the stationary rings have formed (Figure 4B). Further, as
          predicted by the conservation of volume assumption, the
          pole-to-pole distance increases as the furrow radius
          decreases (Figure 4B).
          By measuring the cell dimensions and using measured
          interphase cortical stiffnesses (1.55 nN/μm) [ 9 10 ] ,
          we calculated the minimal required force for a dividing
          cell at each stage using equations 1-3 (Figure 4C, 4D;
          Table 1; see Methods). From this analysis, the peak force
          requirement occurs when the cell acquires a cylindrical
          shape. This level of force persists until the point when
          the radius of the furrow begins to constrict beyond the
          radius of the emerging daughter cells. After this time,
          the cleavage furrow continues to ingress, which results
          in cell shapes that require progressively less
          contractile force to maintain. By the time the cell has
          assumed a dumbbell shape, the required contractile force
          is nearly one third of that required during the
          cylindrical shape stage.
          The amount of myosin-II required to produce the needed
          force at each point during division was estimated by
          considering the physical properties and cellular
          concentration of myosin-II (see Methods). We performed
          these calculations to approximate the amount of myosin-II
          required at each stage of division (Table 1). About 10%
          of the total cellular myosin-II are required in the
          cylindrical shape and the amount decreases to about 5% by
          the dumbbell shape. The amounts and trends predicted from
          the simple Yoneda and Dan equation [ 4 ] are in close
          agreement to the amounts and trends measured by ratio
          imaging (Table 1).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Myosin-II localization is the result of a dynamic steady
        state in which recruitment is offset by thick filament
        disassembly. In this model, a signal that possibly emanates
        from the mitotic spindle instructs the cortex to recruit
        myosin-II to the furrow cortex and to begin contraction.
        This leads to the elongation of the cell to the cylindrical
        form followed by constriction of the furrow. Myosin-II is
        recruited until enough protein has accumulated and the cell
        can constrict in the desired manner. More myosin-II is
        recruited to the furrow cortex when 
        D. discoideum cells are flattened by
        agar overlay when compared to cells grown under standard
        conditions on the surface of a culture plate [ 18 ] .
        Flattening a cell by agar overlay may increase the apparent
        stiffness of the cell by introducing tension into the
        cortex from increased hydrostatic pressure. Intriguingly,
        myosin-II null 
        D. discoideum cells divide relatively
        normally if allowed to adhere to a surface [ 8 ] , but
        myosin-II becomes essential if the adherent cells are grown
        under a sheet of agarose [ 19 ] .
        The pathway for myosin-II disassembly is most likely
        always active and the direction of the steady state depends
        on whether the signal to recruit myosin-II is active.
        Consistent with this concept, Yumura [ 20 ] measured the
        turnover of cortically distributed myosin-II by
        fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and
        showed that wild type myosin-II is localized to the cortex
        with a half-life of about 7 seconds. This cortical
        half-life is the same regardless of whether the cell is in
        interphase or undergoing cytokinesis. On the other hand,
        the 3 × Ala mutant myosin-II has a half-life greater than
        the several minutes used to track the protein. The
        quantitation of the distribution of the 3 × Ala
        GFP-myosin-II verifies that phosphorylation-controlled
        disassembly is a normal part of myosin-II turnover. The
        amount of the 3 × Ala myosin-II enrichment in the furrow
        cortex might represent normal accumulation of myosin-II
        that is ordinarily offset by the disassembly of the
        myosin-II thick filaments possibly as a part of a feedback
        mechanism that senses the mechanical needs of the cell.
        The data presented here does not distinguish between
        recruitment of myosin-II to the cleavage furrow cortex by
        cortical sliding or recruitment from the cytoplasm. Between
        the period of cytokinesis involving transition from a
        spherical cell shape to a cylindrical shape, there is
        little or no net flux of myosin-II from the cytoplasm to
        the cortex. A simple interpretation is that the myosin-II
        simply slides along the cortex from the poles to the
        cleavage furrow. Indeed, FRAP studies support a model where
        dynamic myosin-II filaments progressively slide along the
        cortex while exchanging with the cytoplasmic pool of
        myosin-II monomers [ 20 ] . However, between the
        cylindrical and dumbbell stages of cell shape, there is a
        net flux of myosin-II from the cytoplasm to the cortex.
        This flux from the cytoplasm to the cortex may simply
        reflect the increase in the surface area (and consequently
        the cortex volume) to total cell volume ratio and may not
        be specific to cytokinesis per se. Then, cortical flow
        could continue to concentrate the myosin-II into the furrow
        cortex. Since more 3 × Ala myosin-II than wild type
        myosin-II is recruited to the cleavage furrow cortex, the
        recruitment mechanism is unlikely to be limiting for the
        wild type myosin-II. This suggests that an unlimiting
        regulator molecule may control the localization of
        myosin-II. A candidate for a catalytic regulator molecule
        is the PAKa kinase, which is required for myosin-II
        localization to the cleavage furrow cortex [ 21 ] . This
        kinase could act on enzymes that regulate the myosin-II
        assembly-state or it could act on a cortical receptor for
        myosin-II thick filaments.
        During cytokinesis, global and spatial mechanical
        properties are likely used to deform a cell, allowing the
        constriction of the cell's equator (reviewed in [ 22 ] ).
        These spatial properties include local modulation of
        stiffness and the generation of contractile force. A
        localized stiffness increase may define the region that is
        deformed during a morphological process. The cleavage
        furrow cortex increases in stiffness above the global
        stiffness in mammalian cells as determined by atomic force
        microscopy [ 23 ] . This regional increase in stiffness is
        likely to occur in most or all metazoan and ameboid cells.
        For example, in 
        D. discoideum, the cortexillin
        actin-filament crosslinking proteins are recruited to the
        cleavage furrow where they are thought to contribute to the
        stiffness of the cleavage furrow cortex [ 24 25 ] .
        Myosin-II is probably a major contractile force generator.
        However, direct measurement of this parameter is far more
        difficult in small cells. In this paper, we have measured
        the amount of myosin-II that is recruited to the cleavage
        furrow cortex. This amount is in close agreement with the
        estimate of the amount of myosin-II that would be required
        to generate the forces that may be required to cleave a
        cell.
        The mechanical model presented provides a useful
        framework for conceptualizing the quantitation of
        myosin-II. However, there are many issues that must be
        considered before a comprehensive model for contractile
        force production can be developed. First, it should be
        noted that myosin-II null cells can divide if given a
        surface to which to adhere. The mechanism by which these
        cells divide under these conditions is not known. However,
        by considering the mechanics of the process one realizes
        that the cell has the highest need for force generation
        during elongation and initial furrow ingression. Traction
        forces may serve well to elongate the cell, allowing the
        formation of the cylindrical shape. Indeed, myosin-II null
        cells in the absence of surface attachment fail to
        elongate, verifying that myosin-II is required for this
        step when surface traction is not available [ 8 ] . Other
        gelation and solvation factors and possibly an
        unconventional myosin might complete the process once the
        cylindrical shape has been acquired (for further discussion
        see [ 3 ] ). Interestingly, during interphase the myosin-II
        null cells are 30% less stiff in bending modulus and 70%
        less stiff in surface tension than the wild type parental
        cells [ 10 26 ] . Thus, by considering the mechanics of
        division, one realizes that myosin-II null cells probably
        require significantly less force to divide, making it
        easier to cleave. Since other proteins are likely to
        contribute to contractile force production, the
        quantitation of the amount of myosin-II recruited to the
        cleavage furrow cortex allows us to estimate how much force
        can be provided by myosin-II. In fact, there are adequate
        amounts of myosin-II to generate at least the majority of
        the forces that are estimated to be required. It is
        reasonable that the contractile ring may be able to
        generate greater force than is minimally required. Having
        the ability to generate more force than is minimally
        required may have great utility in nature. Environmental
        factors such as cell-cell contact and hypotonicity might
        place additional demands on the equatorial contractile
        apparatus that go beyond the intrinsic stiffness of the
        cell cortex.
        Another issue is that the level of myosin-II activity
        may be able to vary. In muscle, there is load-dependent
        recruitment of myosin-II cross-bridges; in other words, the
        duty ratio of muscle myosin-II can vary (reviewed by [ 27 ]
        ). For our calculations, we considered the duty ratio to be
        0.006, which is the value measured for unloaded 
        D. discoideum myosin-II.
        Load-dependent recruitment of crossbridges for 
        D. discoideum myosin-II has not been
        examined so it is not known whether this is important for a
        simple eukaryotic nonmuscle myosin-II. However, this ratio
        may be able to change in a load-dependent manner such that
        the amount of myosin-II that is recruited to the cleavage
        furrow may be able to generate much greater forces than
        appear to be minimally required. Myosin-II activity might
        also be predicted to vary as a result of localized
        activation by myosin light chain phosphorylation. However,
        in 
        D. discoideum, myosin light chain
        phosphorylation is not required for cytokinesis so this is
        unlikely to be a major consideration [ 28 29 ] . Finally,
        the ratio imaging experiments do not allow us to make
        conclusions regarding the radial uniformity of the
        myosin-II in the cleavage furrow cortex. Thus, it is
        possible that the force generation is not generated in a
        perfectly symmetrical fashion. However, the contractile
        force may not need to be generated in an entirely uniform
        manner to generate the needed forces to stabilize the
        ingression of the cleavage furrow cortex. The quantitation
        of amounts of myosin-II that are recruited to the
        contractile ring is an essential starting point for
        developing a more detailed but experimentally tractable
        model for cytokinesis. Given the complex bookkeeping
        involved in accounting for the contributions of each
        individual force generator to the precise mechanical needs
        of every individual cell, it is remarkable that the trends
        of myosin-II distribution are so closely predicted by the
        simple theoretical analysis.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Direct measurements of the cortex stiffness and
        contractility as a function of position and time during
        cytokinesis in wild type and mutant cells will be essential
        to identify the contribution of myosin-II to the mechanics
        of cell shape changes. Examination of the effects of other
        proteins that are involved in cytokinesis such as the
        cortexillins [ 24 25 ] and dynacortin [ 30 ] will also be
        necessary to understand how different factors contribute to
        the different mechanical parameters such as stiffness and
        contractility. It should be remembered that in this study
        the agreement between the amount of myosin-II required in
        the cleavage furrow cortex determined from Hooke's law and
        the amount measured using ratio imaging is strictly
        correlative. What is most notable, however, is that the
        trends predicted from the simple model accurately predict
        the trends of myosin-II recruitment to the cleavage furrow
        cortex. Other more sophisticated models for cytokinesis
        have been presented [ 31 ] . However, the value of this
        simple theoretical analysis is that it more accurately
        predicts the trends of contractility, which may be assigned
        in large part to myosin-II and it can be easily tested in a
        variety of cell types for its validity. If it generally
        provides reliable estimates of the mechanical
        considerations for dividing cells, it would be a useful
        tool for researchers who are interested in quantitative
        approaches to studying the biology of cytokinesis.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          DNA manipulation and cell culture
          All DNA manipulations were carried out using standard
          procedures [ 32 ] unless otherwise specified.
          GFP-myosin-II and NLS-GFP were simultaneously expressed
          from the same extrachromosomal plasmid vector (p102 in
          the case of wild-type GFP-myosin-II, p122 in the case of
          3 × Ala GFP-myosin-II). To generate p102, the coding
          region of Bex1 GFP [ 15 ] was subcloned into pBS-MyBam [
          33 ] . The fusion of GFP to the N-terminal region of the
          myosin-II heavy chain gene was subsequently subcloned
          into pBigMyD. The coding region of Vex1 GFP [ 15 ] was
          subcloned into pDXA-3C [ 34 ] as described [ 8 ] , and
          the NLS-GFP expression cassette subcloned into p102. p122
          was made by replacing the 3' region of the myosin-II
          heavy chain gene in p102 with the equivalent fragment
          from pBIG-ALA [ 5 ] .
          All constructs were transformed into the parental JH10
          strain or HS1, a myosin-II heavy chain ( 
          mhcA -) null strain [ 13 ] , unless
          otherwise indicated. Cells were cultured in DD-Broth20 [
          34 ] with the addition of 100 μg/ml thymidine for JH10
          and 10 μg/ml G418 for plasmid selection. The
          pLD1A15SN:GFP-dynacortin plasmid was transformed into DH1
          cells and the cells were grown in Hans' Enriched HL-5
          with 7.5 μg/ml G418 [ 30 ] . For experiments with Texas
          Red-dextran, the fluorescent dextran was electroporated
          into cells.
        
        
          Microscopy
          For microscopic observation, cells were plated in
          chambered coverslips (Nalge Nunc) for 2 hours in fresh
          medium, washed once with Imaging Buffer (20 mM MES pH
          6.8, 25 mM potassium chloride, 2 mM magnesium sulfate,
          0.2 mM calcium chloride) and covered with 1.5 ml of the
          same buffer. Observations were made with a Zeiss Axiovert
          100TV with Plan-Apo 63x/1.4 NA objective (Carl Zeiss
          Inc.). Fluorescence images from 30-50 ms exposures were
          recorded using a TE/CCD-512TKB camera and ST-138
          controller (Princeton Instruments Inc.) and manipulated
          with Image 1/Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corp.).
          Fluorescence images were collected with triple
          bandpass dichroic (450-485 nm, 510-550 nm and 590-650 nm
          transmitted; Chroma Tech. Corp.) and Hi-Q FITC emission
          filter (510-560 nm transmitted; Chroma Tech. Corp.).
          Pairs of images of Bex1 and Vex1 GFPs were recorded in
          rapid succession (<500 ms) by switching bandpass
          excitation filters between 479-501 nm and 398-413 nm
          using a Lambda 10-2 filter wheel controller (Sutter
          Instrument Co.).
        
        
          Ratio image analysis
          Image processing was in three principal steps:
          background subtraction, correction for spectral overlap
          and ratio generation. Mean background signal was measured
          in a region of each image unpopulated by cells and
          subtracted from the entire image. Spectral overlap was
          measured in cells expressing only one of the two GFP
          variants. These measurements showed that the intensity of
          the Bex1 signal using a Vex1 excitation filter was 0.11 ±
          0.0054 (n = 44; all measurements are mean ± SEM) of the
          Bex1 signal using a Bex1 excitation filter. Further, the
          intensity of the Vex1 signal using a Bex1 excitation
          filter was 0.027 ± 0.00057 (n = 50) of the Vex1 signal
          using a Vex1 excitation filter. These measurements
          allowed the contributions of each GFP to the image
          intended to represent the other GFP to be subtracted out.
          Division of the corrected GFP-myosin-II image by the
          corrected NLS-GFP image yielded ratio images with pixel
          intensities that are proportional to local myosin-II
          concentrations (except in the region occupied by the
          nucleus).
          Four regions of dividing cells were defined for
          analysis purposes: the cortex as a whole, the cytoplasm,
          the cortex underlying the cleavage furrow and the cortex
          underlying the poles (Figure 1). The cytoplasm was
          defined as the entire contents of the cell excluding the
          cortex and the nuclei. The cortex was defined as a layer
          with a constant thickness of 0.35 μm. This number is
          justified because the thickness of cortical GFP-myosin-II
          fluorescence is approximately 0.35 μm and is consistent
          with published electron micrographs of 
          D. discoideum cell cortices [ 35 ]
          . It should be noted that fluorescence that is defined as
          cytoplasm also includes fluorescence from the overlying
          and underlying cortices. However, this amount of cortex
          contributes less than 2% of the total fluorescence of the
          cytoplasm, which is within the error of the cytoplasmic
          concentration measurement (Table 1) and is, therefore,
          negligible.
          The furrow and polar cortical regions were each
          subsets of the cortex as defined above. The cortex
          underlying the furrow is considered to extend outwards
          from the equator as far as the point of inflection of the
          curvature of the cell (Figure 1). This region corresponds
          well to the most advanced part of the furrow and to the
          region in which myosin-II is concentrated. This region
          also contains the contractile ring actin filaments [ 36 ]
          . The polar cortex is defined as the two cortical regions
          furthest from the equator, these regions being of
          equivalent size to the furrow region as defined above
          (Figure 1E). Regions of interest were drawn manually onto
          images and their mean pixel intensities were recorded and
          processed in Excel (Microsoft). Graphical representations
          were generated in KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software).
          To convert the ratios of myosin-II into quantities,
          the volumes of each of the cell regions of were
          calculated from the cell's dimensions. First, the total
          cell volume was determined. Then, the cytoplasm volume
          was calculated by considering the dimensions of the whole
          cell minus the cortex and the cortex volume was
          calculated as the difference between the total cellular
          volume and the cytoplasm volume. To calculate the furrow
          cortex volume at the cylinder stage, the furrow was
          considered to be the "belt" that constricts in subsequent
          time points. At the cylinder stage it was determined to
          be 30% of the cell's total length. The volume of the
          furrow cortex was calculated as a difference between the
          outer cell cylinder and the inner cytoplasmic cylinder.
          At the dumbbell stage, the cleavage furrow cortex volume
          was calculated as the sum of its parts (see Figure 1E).
          First, the intercellular bridge was modeled as the
          difference between the inner and outer cylinders. The
          portion of the furrow cortex flanking the intercellular
          bridge, which extend upwards to the flexion point of the
          curvature of the main cell body, was modeled as a
          difference of inner and outer spherical caps. The small
          fraction of this volume where the intercellular bridge
          intersects the spherical caps was subtracted from the
          furrow cortex volume.
          To determine the fraction of myosin-II in any
          compartment, the concentration of myosin-II in the furrow
          cortex was 
          
            c 
           , the concentration in the cytoplasm was 
          
            c 
           • (1/ratio of furrow cortex to cytoplasm), and the
          concentration in the polar cortex was 
          
            c 
           • (1/ratio of furrow cortex to polar cortex). Then,
          the sum of the products of the concentrations of each
          part multiplied by that part's volume equals 100% of the
          myosin-II in the cell. Once 
          
            c 
           is solved for algebraically, the concentrations of
          each part can be determined and the fraction of the total
          cellular myosin-II in each region is the product of the
          concentration and the region's volume.
        
        
          Analysis of Cell Geometry and Calculation of
          Minimal Force Requirements
          To analyze the cell geometry during cytokinesis,
          dimensions of dividing 
          D. discoideum cells were measured
          using NIH Image to determine the number of pixels for a
          particular dimension. Calculations were made with Excel
          (Microsoft Corp.).
          To calculate the minimal required force to cleave a
          cell, we used Yoneda and Dan's equation [ 4 ] :
          γ/R 
          f = 2S 
          c (cosΘ)     Equation 1
          where γ is the contractile force, R 
          f is the radius of the furrow, S 
          c is the stiffness of the cell cortex
          and Θ is the angle between the tangent to the cortex at
          the base of the furrow and the cleavage plane (Figure
          4C). We considered S 
          c to be 1.55 nN/μm, which was measured
          using a microcapillary aspiration technique [ 9 10 ] . To
          calculate the balance of forces using the equation
          proposed by Yoneda and Dan [ 4 ] , the in-plane stiffness
          or surface tension is the appropriate parameter to
          consider. The glass needle indentation method [ 26 ] has
          also been used to measure the cortical stiffness of 
          D. discoideum. However, this method
          mostly measures the bending modulus.
          To determine the minimal force requirements of cells
          undergoing cell division, we analyzed movies of dividing 
          D. discoideum cells. The diameter
          of the cleavage furrow (2R 
          f ) and the pole to pole distance (2Z 
          p ) were measured. The radius (r) of
          each emerging daughter cell was calculated using the
          following:
          r = (Zp 2+ Rf 2)/2Z 
          p     Equation 2
          Then, Cos(Θ) was calculated from the following:
          cos(Θ) = (Zp - r)/r     Equation 3
          The contractile force was then calculated by inputting
          the various quantities and solving for γ. Parameters were
          plotted versus cell shape (which change as a function of
          time) to demonstrate how the minimal required contractile
          force varied as a function of cell shape.
          The amount of myosin-II required to produce a
          particular amount of force was calculated by assuming
          that a single head of myosin-II produces 3.5 pN of force
          [ 12 ] . To correct for myosin-II's duty ratio (t 
          s / t 
          c ), the following considerations were
          used. The maximum velocity (V) for translation of actin
          filaments by 
          D. discoideum myosin-II is 3.3 μm/s
          [ 13 ] and the step size is 8 nm [ 14 ] . If V equals the
          step size divided by the strongly bound state time (t 
          s ), then t 
          s equals 8 nm/3300 nm/s or about 2.4
          msec. The V 
          max for the actin-activated myosin-II
          ATPase cycle is about 2.5 s -1 [ 14 ] . Therefore, the
          total cycle time (t 
          c ) is about 400 msec. Thus, the duty
          ratio is about 0.006 for 
          D. discoideum myosin-II. For
          comparison, the duty ratio for vertebrate skeletal
          myosin-II is about 0.05 [ 11 ] .
          To determine the percentage of total cellular
          myosin-II, the following assumptions were used to
          calculate the total amount of myosin-II in a cell: total
          protein concentration in 
          D. discoideum is 50 μg/10 6cells [
          37 ] , myosin-II represents about 1% of the cell's
          protein [ 38 39 ] , the relative molecular mass of a
          hexameric "monomer" (two each of the heavy chain and
          essential and regulatory light chains) of myosin-II is
          557 kDa, and the average size of a 
          D. discoideum cell is about 8 μm in
          diameter when grown on surfaces. To determine the average
          cell size, cultures were grown on surfaces, resuspended
          in media, and the population distribution of the cell
          diameter measured with a Z1 Coulter counter (Beckman
          Coulter Inc.). From this, an average density of myosin-II
          per μm 3was determined to be approximately 2000 monomers
          per μm 3(approximately 3.4 μM) so that the amount of
          myosin-II in any cell with a particular volume could be
          estimated, assuming that the average concentration
          remains the same.
