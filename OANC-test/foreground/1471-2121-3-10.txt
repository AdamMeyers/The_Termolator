        We have been interested in quantitative analysis of gene
        expression within single cells and the distribution of that
        expression within populations of cells replicating in
        culture (e.g.,) [ 1 2 3 ] . Since the level of any specific
        protein within a cell is dynamic, and since it is difficult
        to describe cells in tissue culture as "steady state"
        entities, describing gene expression in cell populations in
        quantitative terms becomes a complex problem. Here we have
        explored the relationship of SV40 large T antigen (Tag)
        expression as a function of cell density and cell cycle
        duration in clonal populations of Tag-immortalized mouse
        astrocytes. These cells depend on expression of T antigen
        for viability.
        Expression of Tag in mouse cells under selective
        conditions that do not require tumorigenic transformation
        (e.g., transduction by retrovirus and selection for drug
        resistance) produces immortal cell lines with limited
        transformation phenotypes [ 4 5 ] . However, expression of
        Tag has profound effects on the cell cycle, significantly
        reducing cell doubling time and increasing saturation
        density [ 4 5 6 ] . These direct effects of Tag result from
        binding and inactivation of the retinoblastoma family
        proteins (p130, Rb, p107) and the tumor suppressor, p53 [ 7
        8 9 ] . Tag is rate limiting for G 
        1 transit, and this effect (as well as
        saturation density and growth in soft agar) is Tag-dose
        dependent [ 3 10 11 12 ] . Since the cell lines in this
        study are capable of entering a quiescent state at
        saturation density [ 6 ] , one might expect that the levels
        of Tag would decrease at saturation and as cells
        progressively slow down as a function of cell density.
        However, we have previously noted that the Tag increased
        in Tag-transformed NIH 3T3 cells as the population became
        more dense and the cell cycle time increased during
        exponential growth [ 11 ] . For some cell types, like
        fibroblasts and lymphocytes, G 
        0 cells have less cell mass than cycling
        cells, and one might expect that Tag expression would
        decrease as the G 
        1 phase of the cycle lengthened and
        cells achieved confluence. Since Tag did not decrease
        simultaneously with an increasing G 
        1 time, and since Tag was one of the G 
        1 rate-limiting molecules, the activity
        of Tag must have been decreasing while Tag levels
        increased. Thus, negative control of the cell cycle as a
        function of cell density was dominant to the activity of
        Tag. Though the Tag-transformed NIH-3T3 cells could not
        maintain a monolayer at confluence (did not enter G 
        0 ) during the plateau phase of growth,
        it was expected that expression would eventually plateau or
        decrease.
        The purpose for this study was to explore further the
        relationship between Tag expression as a function of cell
        cycle time and cell density. We asked whether Tag
        expression in immortalized mouse cells always increased as
        a function of G 
        1 time during exponential growth and
        whether levels eventually decreased or achieved a steady
        state level at high cell density. The advantage to using
        astrocyte lines is that many of these lines can maintain a
        monolayer in culture for long periods of time [ 6 ] . Since
        Tag levels are significantly determined by the strength of
        the transcription promoter in this retroviral system [ 1 11
        ] , we examined cell lines immortalized by Tag transcribed
        from two different promoters. In the analysis of these
        data, we (1) explored the relationship between expression,
        G 
        1 phase time, and cell density, (2)
        asked whether the transcriptional promoter affected those
        relationships, (3) explored analytical methods for
        describing expression within the context of these
        relationships, and (4) asked whether the "intrinsic
        expression potential" of Tag affected Tag expression at
        high cell density. The results of this study have practical
        implications for the use of cell lines as standards in
        quantitative assays of gene expression [e.g., [ 3 ] ].
      
      
        Results
        
          Characterization of tkT lines
          We have previously characterized clonal mouse
          astrocyte cell lines, immortalized by transduction of
          SV40 large T antigen expressed from the MoMuLV LTR [ 6 13
          ] . Here, we compare variation in Tag levels in 3 of
          these lines and 3 additional lines (termed tkT lines),
          immortalized with Moloney Sarcoma Virus vectors
          expressing Tag from an internal herpes thymidine kinase
          (tk) promoter. The astrocyte lineage of the LTR lines has
          been published [ 6 13 ] . The astrocyte lineage of the
          tkT lines was confirmed by the presence of the
          astrocyte-specific intermediate filament protein, GFAP [
          14 ] (Figure 1). All of the lines contained GFAP, whereas
          NIH 3T3 cells treated with dibutyryl cAMP at the same
          level as the astrocyte lines did not.
        
        
          Expression of Tag
          To determine the Tag expression of each cell line at a
          single density and validate cytometric measurements,
          Western blotting was performed on all cell lines and
          compared to purified, recombinant Tag (Figure 2A).
          Lysates from equal numbers of cells were loaded on the
          electrophoresis gel with the exception of P0-13D tkT#13,
          which expressed the lowest levels of Tag. This lysate was
          loaded at a 2-fold higher cell number. Protein levels of
          each sample and the recombinant Tag were adjusted to
          equality by the addition of NIH 3T3 cell extract. The
          presence of equal protein levels in each lane was
          confirmed by staining the blotted gel with Coomassie blue
          and performing densitometry. The protein levels were not
          significantly different (coefficient of variation (CV) of
          < 9%). Tag in the cell lines migrated at the correct
          molecular weight and cross-reacting bands were not
          detected. When the Tag-specific fluorescence (all cell
          cycle phase fractions) measured by flow cytometry was
          compared to the intensity of Western blot bands measured
          by densitometry, the two measurements showed an
          essentially linear relationship (Figure 2B). Therefore,
          immunofluorescence flow cytometry provides an unbiased
          estimate of the relative levels of Tag expression for the
          range of measurements presented in this paper.
        
        
          Effect of cell density related cell cycle control
          on expression of Tag
          A priori, one might expect that most cell cycle
          related genes will be less expressed in growth arrested,
          confluent, or G 
          0 cells relative to proliferating
          cultures due to a generalized decrease in metabolic
          activity, cell protein content, and cell size. However,
          based on unpublished observations and previous work (see
          Introduction,) [ 11 ] , we expected that the Tag
          expression-cell density profiles would look like that in
          Figure 3. To test this idea, we measured Tag expression
          by immunofluorescence flow cytometry (see Figure 4) in 6
          Tag-immortalized mouse astrocyte lines plated at a range
          of cell densities and cultured for 2-3 days as previously
          described [ 15 ] . The upper densities ensured in most
          cases that the cells would be in either the "transition"
          or "plateau" phase for some of the measurements. Since
          Tag accumulates throughout the cell cycle, populations
          with different phase fractions will have different
          average levels, therefore, we measured Tag from the G 
          1 population to generate measurements
          independent of the cell cycle phase fraction distribution
          as previously described [ 3 ] .
          Figure 5Ashows the relationship of final cell number
          to initial cell number for two combined experiments from
          one cell line. Plots like this were used to determine the
          samples that represented the exponential portion of a
          growth curve. The slope of a straight line was calculated
          and samples were chosen for inclusion when the slope was
          either maximal or > 2.0 when sufficient data could not
          be obtained by maximization. The %G 
          1 curves (5B) were used as a secondary
          guide to selecting the exponential data. Figure 5Bshows
          that the G 
          1 fraction increased as a function of
          final cell density but that more dense cells arrested
          with a significant fraction of S, G 
          2 , and M cells. The increase in the G
          
          1 fraction was expected as we have
          demonstrated in several cell systems that the G 
          1 cell cycle phase increases in length
          and frequency during exponential growth as a function of
          cell density [ 11 15 16 ] . This change in G 
          1 can be demonstrated either by
          successive harvests from cells plated at a single density
          or by plating cells at different densities and harvesting
          simultaneously (as in this study). The presence of S
          phase at confluence is typical of transformed cells.
          Figure 5(C, D) shows the expression profiles for Tag
          versus %G 
          1 (C) and final cell density (D). The
          exponential region defines the data used for regression
          measurements. Tag expression at terminal cell density,
          "Final Tag", was determined by the average of the final
          two samples (arrow).
          To evaluate expression, Tag measurements for samples
          in exponential growth (see above criteria) were subjected
          to linear regression on final cell density to generate an
          intercept representing the Tag level at a hypothetical
          zero cell density. This value for each experiment was
          used to normalize data for each data set to a zero cell
          density value of 100 and thus correct for differences in
          fluorescence measurements obtained in multiple
          experiments, and additionally, scale the data to be
          independent of cell line specific expression levels. The
          normalized data were then combined for replicate or
          triplicate experiments and subjected to linear regression
          on the fraction of G 
          1 cells and final cell densities. Data
          for two cell lines are shown in Figure 6. For all cell
          lines, the slope and SE of the slope were calculated and
          plotted in Figure 7. In one of the cell lines, the slopes
          for Tag versus both G 
          1 and cell density were not
          significantly different from zero. For another line, the
          slopes had significant positive values, and in the
          remaining 4 lines both slopes were negative and
          significant. Figure 6shows data for the cell line that
          did not differ from zero and a representative line with
          negative slopes. The two cell lines that did not display
          a decrease in Tag during exponential growth were
          transformed with retroviruses utilizing the retroviral
          LTR. Three of the cell lines that showed a significant
          decrease in Tag during exponential growth utilized
          retroviruses encoding transcription of Tag from the htk
          promoter, which can be a weak promoter in mouse cells [ 1
          11 ] but subject to cell line specific effects (see
          discussion). One of the cell lines showing a significant
          decrease in Tag expression was K1-30 which encoded an
          Rb-binding defective mutant Tag transcribed from the
          retroviral LTR [ 6 ] .
        
        
          Serum levels do not affect Tag expression
          It is possible that Tag expression could be regulated
          by factors in serum, and that these factors could be
          progressively depleted at increasing cell numbers. To
          test this, the cell line in which Tag control was most
          sensitive to density, P0-3D tkT#5, was grown for 3 days
          starting at an intermediate density of 10 6cells per 10
          cm plate with varying concentrations of serum ranging
          from 2.5-10%. Tag level as well as %G 
          1 was equivalent at all serum levels
          (Table 2). Since, there is significantly less serum/cell
          in 2.5% serum samples, we conclude that factors in serum,
          at concentrations that maintain exponential growth, do
          not regulate Tag levels in these cell lines.
        
        
          Characterization of density and growth phase
          effects on Tag
          
            Tag expression at high cell density
            For each cell line, the levels of Tag at high cell
            density (either transition or plateau phase) were
            significantly lower than during exponential growth.
            This level ranged from a 12-63% decrease compared to
            the hypothetical Tag level of 100 (normalized) at 0
            cell density (Table 1).
          
          
            Tag expression at zero and late cell
            densities
            Figure 8Ashows the correlation plot for the
            objective, "expression potential" intercept measurement
            at zero cell density (defined above) and Tag measured
            from Western blots in Figure 2. The Western blot data
            represent a sampling of Tag expression on growing
            cultures, in late exponential growth, and thus might
            reflect the average, qualitative experiment. The
            overall agreement with the intercept measurement
            supports the use of this objective means to determine
            expression potential, i.e., expression that is
            independent of population growth/density effects, in
            quantitative analysis. The R 2value for the regression
            is 79%. The single outlier represents P0-17D#8 which is
            the only cell line that showed an increase in Tag
            during exponential growth and so would not be expected
            to fit the regression as well. If P0-17D#8 is removed,
            the R 2is 97%.
          
          
            Relationship of Tag expression as a function of
            cell density and G 1phase time
            An increase in the fraction of G 
            1 cells as a linear function of cell
            density is a common observation in this laboratory
            [e.g., Figure 4B, [ 11 15 16 ] ]. Figure 8Bshows that
            there is a correlated relationship between the slopes,
            i.e., changes in Tag concentration as a function of G 
            1 phase time is correlated with
            changes in Tag as a function of cell density.
          
          
            Relationship between final Tag and the expression
            profile for G 1
            Figure 8Cshows that there is a significant
            correlation between the rate of change of T antigen as
            a function of cell cycle time and the end-point
            expression level determined at or near a plateau phase
            in these experiments. Therefore, the levels at
            confluence or plateau can be predicted by the direction
            and rate of change during exponential growth. Figure
            8Dshows that the same relationship holds true for cell
            density, as would be expected from Figure 8B.
          
          
            Control of Tag expression during exponential
            growth is independent of the intrinsic expression
            potential
            Figures 8Eand 8Fshow the regression of average Tag
            expression (Western blot in Figure 2) on the G 
            1 and cell density slopes.
            Regression of data for the intercept calculations
            (e.g., as in Figure 8A) gave a similar plot. There
            appears to be no relationship between the intrinsic
            expression "strength" or potential and change in Tag
            expression as a function of G 
            1 phase fraction (time) or cell
            density, i.e., growth related control of Tag
            expression.
          
        
      
      
        Discussion
        There is good evidence that quantitative changes in gene
        expression are important for some regulatory genes. For
        example, periodic quantitative changes in the levels of
        cyclin proteins that activate cyclin dependent
        serine/threonine kinases (cdk's) appear to be the "core"
        cell cycle machinery in mammalian cells. In this case,
        cyclin molecular concentration is directly related to cdk
        activity and activity is directly related to cell cycle
        transition rates [ 17 ] . When regulatory proteins affect
        cell processes involved in disease, measurement of
        molecular concentration takes on added importance. For
        example, the expression of a number of oncogenes,
        proto-oncogenes, and reduced or absence of expression of
        recessive oncogenes has been postulated to provide
        diagnostic and/or prognostic information in human cancers
        [e.g., [ 18 19 20 ] ]. Currently, cancer gene expression
        research is seldom done in a rigorously quantitative
        manner, which may contribute to the sometimes conflicting
        results [ 21 ] . Much evidence leads to the conclusion that
        the tumorigenic phenotype of mammalian cells is markedly
        affected by quantitative changes in expression of
        regulatory genes. In experimental systems, small shifts in
        expression can have profound consequences. For instance, in
        NIH 3T3 cells, expression of SV40 large T antigen (Tag) at
        high levels (~2 × 10 6molecules per G 
        1 cell) decreases the G 
        1 phase time by ~18% [ 3 11 ] . However,
        ~43% of this effect can be accounted for with the initial
        expression of ~ 6000-14,000 molecules per G 
        1 cell and ~87% can be accounted for by
        expression of ~ 103,000-133,000 molecules [ 3 11 ] .
        Previously, we measured the relative dose response for G
        
        1 transit for SV40 Large T antigen
        expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. In this work, the levels of Tag
        in G 
        1 increased 18% during exponential
        population growth as the length of G 
        1 was increasing [ 11 ] . Since Tag is
        rate-limiting for G 
        1 transit in these cells, the increase
        in transit time as a function of G 
        1 Tag concentration represented an
        apparent paradox that is resolved (in the simplest and
        obvious manner) by stating that additional rate-limiting
        entities operate to set the G 
        1 transit time. One easily measured and
        pervasive entity that regulates G 
        1 phase time is cell density, which is
        taken as a surrogate for cell-cell contact. This effect can
        be separated analytically from growth factor concentration
        [ 15 16 ] and therefore, appears to measure independent
        cell cycle regulatory mechanisms. Our work [ 6 11 ] and
        most other work indicates that the cell density dependent
        mechanisms that negatively regulate cell proliferation are
        dominant to Tag. Indeed this may be universal for
        oncogenes, since we are not aware of instances when
        anchorage dependent cells fail to enter a plateau phase in
        tissue culture.
        The study presented in this paper represents further
        investigation into the effect of cell density on gene
        expression. Cell lines were created by incorporation of
        retroviral vectors into the genome and expression of Tag
        from either the retroviral LTR (considered to be a strong
        promoter) or the herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter,
        internal to the viral LTR [ 1 ] . In our established NIH
        3T3 cell line, Tag is expressed from the htk promoter at
        considerably lower levels than from the LTR for a
        considerable time after transduction [unpublished
        observations, and [ 11 ] ]. However, when a large number of
        htk-Tag astrocyte clones were checked 100 days after
        creation, the expression levels displayed a very large
        range, and thus we expect that this weak promoter is
        subject to positional effects on transcription or
        mutational events that affect gene expression (unpublished
        data). Polyclonal populations produced by transduction of
        htk-Tag vectors that were passaged without selection,
        displayed expression levels equivalent to or higher than
        LTR-Tag cell lines (Frisa and Jacobberger, unpublished
        data). This selection for increased Tag expression makes
        sense given the low growth rate of primary mouse astrocytes
        and the ability of Tag to decrease the cell cycle time [ 11
        ] and increase saturation density [e.g., [ 4 6 ] ]. In this
        study, the expression potential of cell lines was not
        related to proliferation related changes in expression of
        Tag, emphasizing that clonal variation for whatever reason
        (which includes promoter strength) accounts for the large
        range of htk related expression.
        Making sense of a quantitative description of the role
        of Tag and other regulatory proteins in cell cycle
        regulation and cell transformation requires either that all
        the parameters affecting expression are measured at the
        same time so that differences can be accounted for, or an
        ability to compute some base line or "expression potential"
        statistic with which to evaluate differences (e.g., between
        cell lines). A practical application of this knowledge is
        the ability to create biological standards from cell lines
        that express varying levels of a given protein and then use
        these in quantitative and/or longitudinal experiments.
        Clearly, in cases where gene expression varies
        significantly with cell density (e.g., P0-3DtkT#5), use of
        these cells as a standard in a longitudinal study would
        require that the standard was measured at the same cell
        density for each experimental sampling, or that a derived
        statistic (Expression/Density or Expression/G 
        1 intercepts) is used to normalize the
        data. In this regard, the good agreement between the
        intercepts and non-density corrected Western blot data for
        cell lines varying over a 20-fold range is supportive.
        Originally, we pursued a strategy of reduced Tag
        expression from the htk promoter as a means of producing
        immortalized, differentiated cells that may have a reduced
        transformation phenotype. We noticed however, that
        initially slow growing cell lines produced with htk driven
        gene expression needed to be cloned early to prevent
        overgrowth of more rapidly growing cells that expressed
        high levels of Tag. This was not true for clonal or
        polyclonal transductants that expressed Tag from the MoMuLV
        LTR, which supports a high level of expression (unpublished
        observations). In the context of this study, we wished to
        explore density dependent expression as a function of these
        two types of transformants. The data presented here show
        that LTR driven Tag expressing cell lines either increase
        Tag during exponential growth despite a progressively
        increasing G 
        1 phase and contact inhibition (density)
        or the levels to not change significantly, whereas those
        created with the htk promoter show varying degrees of
        reduced expression, that is consistent in magnitude between
        experiments, as the cell cycle lengthens. This suggests
        that the LTR is less density regulated than the htk
        promoter, which is subject to down regulation as the cell
        cycle lengthens during contact inhibition of growth. The
        single exception is the pattern of expression observed for
        an LTR driven line expressing a form of Tag that is mutant
        in binding the Rb family proteins [e.g., [ 22 ] ]. This
        density-dependent reduction inTag expression was somewhat
        surprising. We do not know the half life of this mutant T
        antigen (K1). Since it is expressed at levels that are 1-2
        fold that of wild-type Tag in NIH 3T3 cells [ 23 ] , we
        would not expect that the half life was significantly lower
        than that of wild type. Alternatively, the cell line used
        here is a low expressing cell line (<2 fold above the
        lowest expressing cell line). Thus, in this cell line, for
        unknown reasons the protein could be less stable. If the
        idea that transcription strength mainly drives Tag
        expression is kept as the working hypothesis, then there
        are at least three possibilities to explain the K1 data: 1)
        the K1 protein has a mildly shorter half-life and the small
        difference results in a different phenotype vis-à-vis the
        density related expression; 2) failure to bind Rb family
        members significantly affects the half-life during
        exponential growth; 3) the LTR vectors can occasionally
        display integration position effects that in this special
        case was subject to density dependent control that is
        different from most LTR driven cell populations.
        Both the promoters as well as the protein investigated
        here are viral. The cells are dependent on Tag expression,
        and so there is significant selective pressure against
        extinction of Tag expression. Effects of viral promoters
        may reflect the evolution of the viruses and their hosts.
        We have additional evidence that the same type of density
        effects (i.e., changes in gene expression detected
        continuously during exponential growth) may operate on
        native proteins. Tag immortalized human tracheal epithelial
        (HTE) cells grown at different densities and assayed for
        cytokeratins 6 and 18 showed a density dependent decrease
        in cytokeratin immunoreactivity and a concomitant increase
        in %G 
        1 both in normal growth medium and in
        differentiation medium (Frisa & Jacobberger,
        unpublished). Additionally, the expression levels of cyclin
        B1 are lower in replicating Hela cells at high cell density
        (Soni & Jacobberger, unpublished results). It is
        conceivable that other proteins that are at high levels in
        density-arrested cells may be positively regulated by
        density during exponential growth. There are many papers
        that describe genes that are up or down regulated at
        confluence. Several recent papers identify genes that are
        up-regulated by cell density. These include
        TEM1/endosialin, IGF-1, IGF-1R, IGFBP-2, Bak, drp, SP1, p27
        Kip1 [ 24 25 26 27 28 ] . However, cell context differences
        are apparent [e.g. IGFR, [ 29 ] ], and one study used
        several cell lines and demonstrated distinct effects of the
        cell genetic background [ 25 ] . Down-regulated genes
        include bFGF, FGF-2, Topoisomerase II-α, EGFR,, human
        HDAC1, as well as cell cycle regulatory genes among others
        [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 ] . Regions in the bFGF promoter
        have been identified as associated with density-dependent
        down-regulation of bFGF [ 31 ] . The IGF-II P3 promoter is
        down-regulated as a function of cell density, and a 7-base
        pair sequence has been identified that plays a critical
        role in this down-regulation [ 32 ] . Neither the MoMuLV
        LTR or the htk promoters encode this sequence, although
        both encode a 10-base pair sequence that is identical to
        the P3 sequence with an insertion of 3 base pairs at
        position -1081. Most studies focus on transcription and/or
        protein levels. Fewer studies have addressed translation,
        however, iso-forms of c-myc and FGF-2 are translationally
        regulated by cell density [ 34 ] . For many of these genes,
        down regulation at confluence is not surprising (e.g., cell
        proliferation associated genes), and upregulation of
        differentiation specific genes at confluence is equally
        unsurprising. However, a glance at the literature does not
        suggest that any quick classification or generalizations
        should be made.
        Regulation of protein levels is multi-factorial.
        Transcription, translation, protein stability and
        degradation are involved. Tag levels in rapidly growing
        polyclonal cell lines appear to be set primarily by
        transcription [ 11 12 ] . However, as discussed above, Tag
        levels in clonal cell lines produced with the weak htk
        promoter and generated from slowly growing primary cells
        are related to clonality. SV40 Tag is a long-lived protein
        with a half-life variously measured at 48-90 hrs. The long
        half-life of Tag would not normally implicate protein
        stability, however, the magnitude of changes that we
        discuss here, although biologically relevant, are within
        two fold and might be affected by small differences in
        protein stability. Given this line of reasoning, the data
        presented here can be interpreted as evidence for a cell
        contact (density) / cell cycle length related effect on
        transcription that does not affect the retroviral LTR to
        the extent that it does the htk promoter. This effect is
        predictive of the plateau growth phase levels of Tag and
        thus, ultimately should affect, in the case of Tag or
        similar oncogenes, the fate of clones in polyclonal
        populations. For example if an LTR Tag line and htk Tag
        line with equal expression potential were co-cultured, over
        time, one would expect the LTR driven line to dominate.
        Finally, the htk lines here varied significantly in
        terms of Tag expression potential, and in terms of the rate
        at which expression decreased as a function of cell
        density. There was no correlation in the rate of change in
        density related expression and the density independent
        expression (here referred to as intrinsic expression
        potential). This supports the idea that the density
        independent expression in the htk lines is set by the clone
        specific effects (e.g., integration position) and the
        density/cell cycle related expression is set in these cases
        by the promoter.
      
      
        Conclusions
        These data show quantitatively that the Tag expression
        potential of introduced Tag varies over a wide range
        depending on the vector used and clonal variation. The
        expression level is a complex measurement that can be
        partially simplified by accounting for the cell cycle
        transit time and cell density.
        The hypothetical terms, expression at zero cell density
        and expression at minimum G 
        1 phase fraction, were introduced to
        simplify measures of expression potential.
        Accounting for both cell cycle transit time and cell
        density should increase the precision and accuracy with
        which gene expression can be measured. This is important
        for the use of cell lines as quantitative standards for
        gene expression studies, for relating expression to
        phenotype, and for an understanding of gene expression in
        general, and affects ideas on cell engineering.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Generation of astrocyte cell lines
          Cortical astrocytes were harvested from neonatal
          C57BL/6 mice and infected with a replication-defective
          retrovirus encoding Tag and neomycin resistance as
          previously described [ 13 ] . The transferred viruses
          were SV40-6 [ 5 ] , in which wild type Tag is expressed
          from the M-MuLV LTR promoter; SV(X)T K1, which is
          constructed the same as SV40-6 except that the Tag is
          mutant [ 38 ] and defective for binding the
          retinoblastoma protein family [ 39 ] ; Linker-tkT, in
          which the cDNA for Tag is expressed from the herpes
          simplex 1 tk promoter [ 11 ] . The differentiation and
          transformation phenotypes of the cell lines utilizing the
          M-MuLV LTR promoter have been described [ 6 13 ] . The
          Linker-tkT lines (tkT) were either isolated as clones
          after G418 selection (as previously described) [ 6 ] or
          frozen immediately after selection (pooled clones) and
          clonally selected at a later time. Typically, it took 40
          days after infection to obtain colonies and 60 more days
          to generate a rapidly growing line that could be serially
          cultured (split 1:80 at weekly intervals). The lines
          termed early passage in this paper were 140-200 days post
          infection, and all others were 340-860 days post
          infection. The names of the cell lines designate the
          number of days the primary neonatal astrocytes were
          cultured prior to infection. For example, P0-17D#8 is the
          eighth clone derived from cortical astrocytes isolated on
          the day of birth and infected 17 days later. Immortalized
          cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium
          (DMEM, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with 5% fetal bovine serum
          (FBS) and 5% calf serum in 5% CO 
          2 at 37°C.
        
        
          Cell density experiments
          To test density effects, cells were plated in
          duplicate at initial numbers of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 40 ×
          10 5per 100 mm cell culture dish with DMEM containing 5%
          FBS and 5% calf serum. After 2 to 3 days of culture,
          cells were harvested with trypsin and counted on a
          Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL), then
          fixed for cytometry in 0.5% formaldehyde at 37°C followed
          by 95% methanol at -20°C.
        
        
          Cytometry
          Fixed samples were immunostained with anti-Tag, PAb416
          (Ab2, Oncogene Sciences, Mineola, NY), and fluorescein
          isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated secondary antibody
          followed by RNase treatment and propidium staining at 50
          μg/ml, as previously described [ 13 ] . Cells were
          excited with the 488 nm line of the argon laser of a
          Coulter ESP Elite Cytometer (Coulter Electronics, Miami,
          FL). Final filters were 525 nm bandpass (FITC) and 640 nm
          long pass (propidium). A sample from a large batch of
          fixed cells was used to standardize assays in time. This
          sample was stained concurrently in each experiment and
          used to adjust the PMT's to the same FITC and PI
          fluorescences in all experiments. This corrected for
          differences in staining and cytometer set up.
        
        
          Analysis
          Mean FITC-fluorescence of the G 
          1 cell cycle phase population was
          measured by gating to generate a statistic that would be
          independent of changes in cell cycle fractions. Mean G 
          1 fluorescence of samples stained with
          the anti-Tag isotype, IgG2a, and FITC-conjugated
          secondary antibody served as a control for non-specific
          fluorescence and was subtracted from the G 
          1 fluorescence of corresponding
          Tag-stained samples (Figure 4). The result of the
          subtraction is the Tag specific fluorescence and
          corresponds to the amount of Tag in the average G 
          1 cell for a specific population.
          Forward and right angle light scatter were used to gate
          debris. Modeling software (ModFit, Verity Software House,
          Topsham, ME) was used to determine the phase fractions
          from analysis of single parameter DNA data. Linear
          regression, using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows
          (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA,
          www.graphpad.com), was used to determine the slope,
          standard error (SE), and p-value for Tag expression as a
          function of cell density or the frequency of G 
          1 cells.
        
        
          Electrophoresis and western blotting
          Cell extracts were prepared in 10% SDS lysis buffer
          (0.137 M NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 10% SDS, 1% sodium
          deoxycholate, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM PMSF, 10 μl/ml
          protease inhibitor cocktail), which solubilizes
          cytoskeletal and nuclear matrices. Samples of known
          numbers of cells from the cell lines and recombinant,
          purified Tag prepared from a baculovirus lysate [ 40 ]
          were loaded on 10% polyacrylamide discontinuous mini-gels
          (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and electrophoresed
          conventionally [ 41 ] . Gels were then
          electrophoretically blotted [ 42 ] onto PVDF membrane
          (Bio-Rad) without methanol for 15 min at 100 V. Tag was
          visualized by immunostaining with PAb416 and alkaline
          phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) using
          chemiluminescent detection with CDP-Star substrate
          according to the manufacturers directions (Tropix,
          Bedford, MA). Images were developed on X-ray film (Kodak,
          X-Omat, Rochester, NY). Quantification was performed by
          densitometry on the Sci Scan 5000 automated scanning
          system (US Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH).
          To test for astrocyte lineage, early passage cells
          were grown in dibutyryl cAMP (Sigma) to enhance GFAP
          expression. Intermediate filament extracts of the cell
          lines [ 43 44 ] were electrophoretically blotted and
          detected with polyclonal anti GFAP (DAKO, Carpenteria,
          CA) and secondary reagents as above.
