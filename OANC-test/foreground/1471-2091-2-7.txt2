        The cullin/RING family of ubiquitin ligases comprises a
        multifunctional set of enzymes controlling the stability
        and activity of cell cycle regulators, transcription
        factors, and signaling proteins (reviewed in ref. [ 1]).
        Among the best studied examples of cullin/RING enzymes are
        the so-called SCF complexes. SCF complexes share homologues
        of the core components cullin 1 (CUL1), SKP1, and the RING
        domain protein HRT1/RBX1/ROC1, which associate with
        different F-box proteins and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes
        [ 1]. F-box proteins specifically bind substrates,
        following their phosphorylation in response to activation
        of various signaling pathways. Although substrate
        phosphorylation is one major determinant of SCF-mediated
        ubiquitylation [ 1], covalent modification of the CUL1
        subunit through attachment of the ubiquitin-related peptide
        NEDD8 also regulates SCF activity. NEDD8 modification
        stimulates SCF-dependent substrate ubiquitylation 
        in vitro [ 2, 3, 4], and mutant CUL1
        resistant to NEDD8 modification is defective 
        in vivo [ 5]. In addition, fission
        yeast mutants deficient in the enzymes that attach Ned8p,
        or in the 
        ned8 gene itself, are inviable [
        5].
        In addition to CUL1, the human genome contains at least
        five other cullins, CUL 2, 3, 4A, 4B, and 5. This diversity
        is partially recapitulated in 
        S. pombe , which encodes 
        pcu3 and 
        pcu4 , homologues of human CUL3 and
        CUL4, for which there are no direct correlates in budding
        yeast [ 6]. All human cullins interact with HRT1/RBX1/ROC1
        [ 7], are modified by NEDD8 [ 8], and have ubiquitin ligase
        activity 
        in vitro [ 9]. Similarly, the fission
        yeast cullins Pcu1p and Pcu4p are neddylated, and
        neddylation is critical for their function 
        in vivo . [ 5].
        While it is clear that neddylation affects the activity
        of cullin/RING complexes, mechanisms controlling this
        modification are just emerging. A recent study by Lyapina 
        et al. uncovered a novel connection
        between the COP9/signalosome (CSN) and cullin neddylation [
        10]. CSN is a highly conserved multiprotein complex
        consisting of eight subunits, which have been implicated in
        a wide variety of regulatory processes, including, cell
        cycle control [ 11, 12], signal transduction [ 13],
        transcriptional activation [ 14], and plant
        photomorphogenesis [ 15, 16]. To date, no distinct
        biochemical activity has been identified that can reconcile
        this diversity in CSN functions. The eight CSN subunits
        show a one-to-one relationship to components of the 19S
        proteasome lid complex [ 17, 18, 19] and, like 
        pcu3 and 
        pcu4 , at least seven of the eight
        human subunits are conserved in fission yeast, but not in
        budding yeast. [ 16, 20].
        Lyapina 
        et al. recently showed that
        disruption of 
        S. pombe CSN subunit 1 ( 
        caa1/csn1 ) results in accumulation
        of Pcu1p in the neddylated state [ 10]. However, it
        remained unclear whether this reflects global control of
        multiple cullins by Csn1p as part of the entire CSN
        complex. We have examined this question by determining the
        effect of disruption of several CSN subunits on Pcu3p
        neddylation, localization, and ubiquitin ligase activity.
        Our results indicate that the entire CSN complex is
        required for proper control of the neddylation state of
        multiple cullins.
      
      
        Results
        
          Pcu3p is modified by Ned8p
          Immunoblotting of protein lysates prepared from 
          S. pombe cells, whose 
          pcu3 chromosomal locus was modified
          to encode Pcu3p with thirteen copies of the Myc epitope
          attached to its C-terminus, revealed two distinct species
          of Pcu3p, which migrated on SDS gels as two closely
          spaced species of roughly equal abundance (Fig. 1A).
          Several findings indicate that the slower migrating form
          of Pcu3p arose from covalent modification with the
          ubiquitin-related protein Ned8p: First, overexpression of
          a fusion protein of Ned8p and glutathione transferase
          (GST-Ned8p) converted the faster, unmodified form of
          Pcu3p into a high molecular weight species that reacted
          with antibodies to GST (Fig. 1A). Second, replacing
          lysine 729, which is homologous to the conserved
          neddylation sites in other cullins, with arginine,
          completely abolished the slower migrating, modified form
          of Pcu3p (Fig. 1B). In contrast, mutation of a
          neighboring conserved lysine (residue 760) did not alter
          the mobility of Pcu3p. Thus, as with other 
          S. pombe cullins [ 5], Pcu3p
          undergoes covalent modification by ubiquitin-like Ned8p
          at lysine 729.
        
        
          Multiple csnmutants accumulate neddylated
          Pcu3p
          Interestingly, fission yeast 
          caa1/csn1 deletion mutants show a
          set of defects, which partially overlaps that found in 
          pcu3 disruptants: slow growth, cell
          elongation, and sensitivity to UV-irradiation, but not
          hydroxyurea [ 6, 21]. With respect to the recent
          implication of CSN in cullin regulation [ 10], we
          considered the possibility that the overlapping
          phenotypes of 
          csn1 and 
          pcu3 mutants could arise from
          interference with Pcu3p function.
          Initial support for this hypothesis was provided by
          the observation that disruption of 
          csn1 led to accumulation of Pcu3p
          in the slower migrating form (Fig. 2A). This shift in
          migration is due to Pcu3p neddylation as shown by
          overexpression of GST-Ned8p in 
          csn1 mutants. This caused an
          additional supershift, converting a substantial portion
          of the slower migrating form into a GST-Ned8p modified
          species (Fig. 2B). Importantly, accumulation of
          neddylated Pcu3p was also apparent in strains deleted for
          
          csn3 , 
          csn4 , and 
          csn5 (Fig. 2A), three genes
          encoding other putative subunits of the 
          S. pombe CSN, which co-fractionate
          with Csn1p upon size exclusion chromatography (see below,
          Fig. 4). However, unlike 
          csn1 disruptants, which have a
          defect in S phase control resulting in slow growth and
          cell elongation [ 21], deletion of 
          csn3 , 
          csn4 , and 
          csn5 genes did not cause cell
          elongation, S phase delay, or any other obvious growth
          defects (Fig. 2C, 2D, data not shown). This indicates
          that the described phenotype of 
          csn1 mutants [ 21] is unlikely to
          be a consequence of interference with Pcu3p activity.
          Pcu1p, another fission yeast cullin also accumulated in
          the neddylated form in all 
          csn mutants [ 10] (Fig. 2A),
          suggesting that CSN has a general role in the control of
          cullin neddylation in fission yeast. The accumulation of
          neddylated Pcu3p was prevented in all 
          csn mutants by providing the
          missing CSN subunit on a plasmid (Fig. 3).
        
        
          The conserved "cysteine box" in Csn5p is not
          required for Pcu3p deneddylation
          Lyapina 
          et al. recently demonstrated that
          partially purified CSN promotes the cleavage of
          Pcu1p-Ned8p conjugates 
          in vitro [ 10], but it remained
          unclear whether the enzymatic activity is contained
          within one of the CSN subunits or a tightly associated
          peptidase. All peptidases known to cleave ubiquitin- or
          SUMO-protein conjugates are cysteine-based proteases
          (reviewed in ref. [ 22]). Csn5p contains a motif closely
          resembling the conserved cysteine box previously
          recognized in the catalytic center of deubiquitylating
          enzymes and in the budding yeast proteasome subunit
          Rpn11p [ 23]. The complementation assay shown in Fig.
          3allowed us to determine the potential role of this motif
          in the control of Pcu3p neddylation by replacing the
          critical cysteine residue with alanine. This mutant Csn5p
          retained full activity for preventing Pcu1p and Pcu3p
          hyperneddylation (Fig. 3Alanes 12-15, and data not
          shown).
        
        
          Pcu3p interacts with CSN
          We next determined whether the effect of CSN
          deficiency on Pcu3p neddylation reflects a physical
          interaction of these proteins. Size exclusion
          chromatography of lysates prepared from cells harboring
          epitope-tagged Pcu3p or CSN subunits at the endogenous
          genomic loci, revealed precise co-elution of Pcu3p with
          CSN subunits 1, 3, 4, and 5 in high molecular weight
          fractions corresponding to approximately 550 kDa (Fig.
          4A). Interestingly, Csn5p, unlike the other CSN subunits,
          showed a second peak in gel filtration eluting with an
          approximate molecular weight of 200 kDa, suggesting that
          Csn5p may also be involved in protein complexes separate
          from the entire CSN (Fig. 4B).
          Based on the co-elution of Pcu3p with CSN subunits in
          gel filtration, we determined whether Pcu3p and Csn1p
          interact 
          in vivo at endogenous expression
          levels. Pcu3-Myc immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells
          expressing HA-tagged Csn1p together with Pcu3p-Myc from
          the endogenous promoters revealed co-precipitation of
          Csn1p-HA. This interaction was specific as it was not
          observed with an irrelevant antibody (Fig. 4Cleft panel)
          or with lysate from a strain containing untagged Pcu3p
          (Fig. 4C, right panel). In contrast, immunoprecipitation
          with HA antibodies failed to precipitate both Csn1p-3HA
          and Pcu3p-Myc, potentially due to inaccessibility of the
          C-terminal 3HA tag of Csn1p within the CSN complex (data
          not shown).
          We therefore generated Pcu3p-Myc containing strains
          overexpressing N-terminally 6xhistidine-Myc-tagged Csn1p,
          Csn3p, Csn4p, or Csn5p. Binding of each of the four
          different CSN subunits to nickel beads resulted in
          co-purification of Pcu3p, indicative of specific 
          in vivo interactions (Fig. 4C).
          Notably, both modified and unmodified Pcu3p interacted
          with CSN subunits (Fig. 4C). We conclude that, at least a
          fraction of Pcu3p forms a stable complex with CSN 
          in vivo .
        
        
          Pcu3p localization in csnmutants
          In 
          A. thaliana , CSN was shown to be
          required for the efficient nuclear accumulation of the
          putative RING-type ubiquitin ligase COP1 [ 24], which
          mediates ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the
          photomorphogenic transcription factor HY5 [ 25]. We
          therefore considered the possibility that accumulation of
          neddylated Pcu3p in 
          csn mutants is a consequence of
          defective subcellular targeting. Indirect
          immunofluorescence staining indicated that endogenous
          Myc-tagged Pcu3p is present in the cytoplasm, but
          enriched in the nucleus of wild-type cells (Fig. 5). This
          localization pattern was fully preserved in all four 
          csn mutants, indicating that CSN
          does not regulate the subcellular localization of
          Pcu3p.
        
        
          Mutation of CSN increases Pcu3p-dependent
          polyubiquitylation activity
          All human cullins have been shown to assemble into
          complexes possessing polyubiquitylation activity 
          in vitro [ 9, 26]. To determine
          whether Pcu3p is associated with such an activity and how
          it is affected by CSN, we developed a
          substrate-independent 
          in vitro polyubiquitylation assay,
          similar to that originally reported by Lyapina et al. [
          27]. As Pcu3p-associated ubiquitin ligase activity was
          not described before, we first needed to determine which
          of the fourteen different ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes
          (UBCs) present in the fission yeast genome associate with
          the RING domain protein Pip1p, an essential cofactor of
          cullin ubiquitin ligases [ 7, 28, 29, 30]. Binding assays
          showed that overexpressed HA-tagged Pip1p specifically
          associated with co-overexpressed 6xHis-Myc-tagged Ubc1p,
          Ubc7p, Ubc11p, Ubc12p, Ubc13p, Ubc14p, and Mms2p. In the
          next step, we confirmed, by immunoprecipitation, that
          both forms of Pcu3p-Myc bound endogenous Pip1p in a
          CSN-independent manner (Fig. 6B).
          Pcu3p-Myc complexes prepared by immunoprecipitation
          with Myc antibodies were then incubated with human E1,
          ATP, ubiquitin, and the recombinant UBCs that interacted
          with Pip1p. Polyubiquitylated species were visualized by
          anti-ubiquitin blot. Pcu3p-Myc complexes isolated from 
          pcu3-13myc cells did not show any
          recognizable polyubiquitylation activity above background
          with any of the seven UBCs tested (Fig. 6C, lane 2, and
          data not shown). In contrast, the ubiquitylation assay
          with Pcu3p-Myc complexes purified from 
          csn5 mutants led to efficient
          formation of high molecular weight species reactive with
          ubiquitin antibodies (Fig. 6C). This activity was
          specific for Ubc7p (Fig. 6C, compare lanes 3 - 7).
          Appearance of multiubiquitin chains was inhibited by
          mutant ubiquitin lacking all lysines, indicating that
          they were specifically generated in the reaction rather
          than co-precipitated with Pcu3p-Myc (Fig. 6D). Thus, CSN
          deficiency appears to stimulate Pcu3p-associated
          ubiquitin ligase activity 
          in vitro . A similar stimulation
          was obtained for substrate-specific polyubiquitylation of
          phosphorylated Rum1p by SCF Poppurified from 
          csn5 mutants (unpublished
          observation).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Our data confirm and extend the recently discovered
        connection between CSN and cullin regulation [ 10] by
        showing that deletion of four putative CSN subunits causes
        accumulation of Pcu3p in the neddylated state (Fig. 2A).
        Co-elution of these four proteins in a 550 kDa complex
        (Fig. 4B) strongly suggests that they represent part of the
        
        S. pombe equivalent of the eight
        subunit CSN complex found in higher eukaryotes [ 18, 19,
        20]. Thus, cullin regulation through modulation of the
        balance of Ned8p modification appears to require the entire
        CSN complex.
        Our study also provides some insight into the role of
        deneddylation in cullin function, as we were able to create
        a situation in which Pcu1p and Pcu3p are fully neddylated 
        in vivo (ref [ 10] and data presented
        here). Deletion of 
        pcu1 and 
        pcu3 results either in lethality or
        in severe growth retardation, respectively [ 6]. The normal
        growth behavior of 
        csn3 , 
        4 , and 
        5 mutants (Fig. 2C, 2D), where both
        cullins seem constitutively neddylated, argues against a
        critical role for dynamic cycles of neddylation and
        deneddylation in cullin function in fission yeast.
        Consistent with this notion, the subcellular localization
        of Pcu3p and Pcu1p were unaffected by mutations in CSN
        (Fig. 5) [ 10]. Instead, neddylated Pcu3p and Pcu1p
        purified from 
        csn mutant cell extract exhibit
        increased ubiquitin ligase activity 
        in vitro (Fig. 6B) [ 10]. Thus, CSN
        may exert negative control on Pcu1p and Pcu3p by promoting
        their deneddylation. However, while mutation of 
        csn5 caused a modest two-fold
        increase in the steady state fraction of neddylated Pcu3p
        (Fig. 2A), Pcu3p-associated ubiquitin ligase activity
        recovered from this mutant showed a much more dramatic
        increase (Fig. 6C). This suggests the possibility that CSN
        represses Pcu3p activity by other mechanisms, in addition
        to its control of neddylation. Further experiments are
        required to determine whether recombinant Csn5p or purified
        CSN complex can inhibit Pcu3p-associated ubiquitin ligase
        activity.
        Lyapina 
        et al. recently provided evidence for
        a cullin deneddylating activity of CSN by demonstrating
        that a partially purified preparation of the pig CSN can
        deneddylate the fission yeast cullin Pcu1p 
        in vitro [ 10]. The results presented
        here eliminate the attractive hypothesis that the cysteine
        box in Csn5p, which is conserved in numerous
        deubiquitylating enzymes [ 23], harbors a critical activity
        for deneddylation (Fig. 3A). In addition, recombinant Csn5p
        failed to deneddylate Pcu1p and Pcu3p 
        in vitro (unpublished observation).
        Our finding that hyperneddylated Pcu3p and Pcu1p accumulate
        in all 
        csn mutants tested (Fig. 2A, and data
        not shown), also suggests that control of cullin
        neddylation results from cooperation of multiple CSN
        components rather than from the activity of a single
        catalytic subunit. The CSN complex may, for example, serve
        as a platform for recruitment of a separate deneddylating
        enzyme. A human NEDD8-processing isopeptidase has been
        described previously [ 31]. The potential role of CSN as an
        organizing center for certain enzymatic activities may not
        be restricted to the control of cullin neddylation, as CSN
        was also shown to mediate phosphorylation of c-JUN, IkBa,
        and p53 by a tightly associated kinase(s) [ 12, 19].
        So far, we were unable to obtain deneddylation of
        Pcu3p-13Myc 
        in vitro by partially purified CSN
        preparations active in deneddylation of Pcu1p-13Myc (data
        not shown). We can therefore not exclude that CSN's role in
        the control of Pcu3p neddylation differs from its role
        established for Pcu1p [ 10]. For example, binding by CSN
        could protect Pcu3p from the Ned8p-conjugating enzyme
        Ubc12p, thus maintaining a fraction of Pcu3p in a
        deneddylated state. As this shield is experimentally
        removed through deletion of CSN subunits, Pcu3p may
        accumulate in the neddylated state. In such a scenario, no
        enzymatic activity of purified CSN toward neddylated Pcu3p
        would be expected 
        in vitro .
        Finally, our data suggest CSN functions in addition to
        cullin regulation that are not shared by all individual
        subunits. Out of the four mutants tested, only 
        csn1 showed the previously described
        defect in S phase progression [ 21] (Fig. 2C, 2D), thereby
        underscoring the significance of our finding that all CSN
        subunits tested here are involved in cullin regulation. It
        is likely that some subunits have very specialized
        functions within the complex, while others are required for
        its broader activities such as control of cullin
        neddylation. On the other hand, we found that a sizable
        fraction of Csn5p is dissociated from the putative CSN
        holocomplex, but enriched in a 200 kDa assembly (Fig. 4B).
        It thus appears that part of the diversification of CSN
        function may arise from formation of smaller
        subcomplexes.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our study reveals a general role of the 
        S. pombe CSN complex in the control
        of cullin modification by Ned8p. Regardless of the exact
        mechanism, CSN may regulate the activity of multiple cullin
        ubiquitin ligases through counteracting their stimulatory
        Ned8p modification. Future studies will reveal whether some
        of the other described functions of CSN also involve
        post-translational modification of regulatory proteins by
        ubiquitin-like modifiers.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Plasmids and yeast strains
          
          S. pombe genes for UBCs and 
          csn3 , 
          4 , and 
          5 were identified in the Sanger
          Centre 
          S. pombe sequence database based on
          their homology to the respective human and budding yeast
          proteins. Complementary DNAs were amplified by PCR and
          subcloned into pRep81.6xHis-Myc, pRep3.6xHis-Myc, or
          pRep4.HA. Deletion strains and epitope-tagged strains
          were constructed by one-step gene replacement using
          PCR-generated fragments containing kanamycin or 
          ura4 cassettes [ 32]. Growth media,
          flow cytometry, and all other relevant 
          S. pombe techniques were described
          previously [ 33].
        
        
          Immunological techniques
          Protein lysates were prepared by bead lysis in a
          Fastprep device (Bio 101) in the presence of proteinase
          inhibitors, followed by boiling in SDS sample buffer.
          Pip1p and Pcu1p were detected with affinity-purified
          rabbit antisera. Epitope-tagged proteins were detected by
          the monoclonal antibodies 9E10 and 12CA5 prepared from
          hybridoma supernatants.
          Cell lysates for immunoprecipitation were prepared by
          disrupting cells in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM
          Tris/HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.5 % Triton X-100, 10
          μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1
          mM PMSF). Lysates were cleared and precipitated with the
          respective antisera. Immunocomplexes were collected by
          binding to protein A or G beads, washed and analyzed by
          immunoblotting as described [ 33].
          For indirect immunofluorescence staining, cells were
          fixed in freshly prepared 3.7% para-formaldehyde for 1h
          at 30°C. Cells were washed in PEM (100 mM Pipes pH6.9, 1
          mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO 
          4 ), and digested with Novozyme (0.5
          mg/ml, Sigma) and Zymolyase (0.5 mg/ml, US Biological) in
          PEM, 1M sorbitol. Unspecific epitopes were blocked by
          incubation in PEM-BAL (PEM plus 1% BSA, 0.1% Na-azide,
          0.1 M L-lysine HCl) for 1h. Incubation with monoclonal
          Myc antibodies diluted in PEM-BAL was done overnight,
          followed by three washes in PEM-BAL. An overnight
          incubation with TRITC-labeled anti mouse antibodies was
          followed by washing and mounting on polylysine coated
          coverslips. Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.
          Photomicrographs were obtained with a CCD camera mounted
          on a Nikon E600 epifluorescence microscope. Brightness
          and contrast were adjusted in Adobe Photoshop 5.0.
        
        
          In vitroubiquitylation assay
          For ubiquitylation reactions, Pcu3p-Myc complexes were
          immunoprecipitated from 100 - 200 ug total cell lysates
          prepared as described above. Precipiates were washed four
          times in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.5 %
          Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 5
          μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM PMS, and equilibrated in 20 mM
          HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM DTT. The
          reaction was started by the addition of a cocktail of 8
          μM ubiquitin, ATP regenerating system (2 mM HEPES at pH
          7.4, 1 mM ATP, 30 mM creatine phosphate, 1 mM magnesium
          acetate, 0.15 mg/ml creatine kinase), reaction buffer (4
          mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM DTT), 500 nM bacterially
          expressed 6xHis-UBCs, 100 nM 6xHis-tagged human E1, and
          0.5 μM ubiquitin aldehyde in a volume of 15 μl. After 90
          min at 30°C, the reaction was terminated by the addition
          5 × SDS sample buffer. Samples were separated on 11 %
          SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting
          with ubiquitin antibodies (Zymed).
