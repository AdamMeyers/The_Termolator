        Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I
        is a representative example of type IA DNA topoisomerase
        (for reviews, see refs [ 1 2 ] ). Its major biological role
        in the bacterial cell is the removal of excessive negative
        supercoils from DNA to maintain the DNA at optimal
        superhelical density along with DNA gyrase [ 3 ] . The
        enzyme has a molecular weight of 97 kDa and the active site
        tyrosine responsible for DNA cleavage is found in the 67
        kDa N-terminal transesterification domain. The structure of
        this 67 kDa domain has been determined by X-ray
        crystallography to be torus-like, indicating the need for
        protein conformational change for strand passage to take
        place after DNA cleavage [ 4 ] . Relaxation activity
        requires the presence of the Zn(II) binding tetracysteine
        motifs [ 5 ] found between the 67 kDa N-terminal domain
        (Top67) and the 14 kDa C-terminal single-stranded DNA
        binding domain (Figure 1). The three tetracysteine motifs
        do not form a stably folded structure on its own, but when
        combined with the 14 kDa C-terminal domain, forms a stably
        folded 268 amino acid DNA binding domain (ZD domain) that
        has higher affinity for single-stranded DNA than the 121
        amino acid 14 kDa C-terminal region by itself [ 6 ] .
        Recent sequence and structural analysis suggests that the
        14 kDa domain is evolutionarily related to the three
        tetracysteine motifs and belongs to the zinc ribbon family
        [ 7 ] . The ZD domain in 
        E. coli topoisomerase I probably
        evolved from a domain that binds five Zn(II)
        originally.
        Removal of negative supercoils from DNA by bacterial
        type IA topoisomerase involves the following steps: (1)
        binding of the enzyme to the junction of double-stranded
        and single-stranded DNA [ 8 ] ; (2) cleavage of a
        single-strand of DNA near the junction with cleavage
        sequence preference of a cytosine in the -4 position to
        form the covalent intermediate [ 9 10 ] ; (3)
        conformational change of the covalent enzyme-DNA complex to
        result in physical separation of the 5' phosphate
        covalently linked to the active tyrosine, and the 3'
        hydroxyl of the cleaved DNA; (4) passage of the
        complementary single strand through the break; (5) enzyme
        conformational change to bring the 5' phosphoryl end back
        into the proximity of the 3' hydroxyl group of the cleaved
        DNA; (6) religation of the phosphodiester bond. Although it
        is known that the ZD domain can function as a DNA binding
        domain, its exact role in these individual steps of removal
        of a negative superhelical turn from DNA by 
        E. coli topoisomerase I remains to be
        defined. Using purified 67 kDa transesterification domain
        and 30 kDa ZD domain, results from experiments described
        here provide new insight into the action of these two
        individual domains in the enzyme mechanism.
      
      
        Results
        
          Partial restoration of relaxation activity from
          mixing of Top67 and ZD domains
          As reported previously [ 11 ] , the N-terminal
          transesterification domain Top67 by itself did not
          exhibit any relaxation activity when assayed with
          negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA (Figure 2a). The 30 kD
          C-terminal ZD domain also had no relaxation activity by
          itself, as expected. Partial relaxation of the input
          supercoiled DNA was detected when Top67 was mixed with
          the ZD domain prior to addition of DNA. A ratio of 2 ZD
          molecules added for each Top67 was found to be sufficient
          for maximum relaxation activity, with no increase in
          activity when higher ratio of ZD/Top67 was used (data not
          shown). The specific activity observed under this
          optimized condition (Figure 2a) was still about 10 fold
          lower than that of the intact enzyme. Analysis of the
          time course of relaxation with 6 pmoles of topoisomerase
          I or top67 reconstituted with ZD (Figure 2b) showed that
          negative supercoils were removed at a much slower rate by
          the reconstituted activity.
        
        
          Top67 and ZD domains have comparable binding
          affinities to single-stranded DNA but significantly
          different affinities for double-stranded DNA
          The gel mobility shift assay was used to compare the
          binding affinities of Top67 and the ZD domain to a 5'
          end-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotide 35 base in
          length. As shown in Figure 3a, these two domains had
          similar affinities for binding to the single-stranded
          substrate. The half maximal binding values based on the
          average of results from three different experiments were
          0.02 μM for Top67 and 0.04 μM for the ZD domain. However,
          with the same oligonucleotide in a duplex form (Figure
          3b), Top67 exhibited much higher affinity (half maximal
          binding value = 0.07 μM) than the ZD domain (half maximal
          binding value > 5 μM).
        
        
          Top67 can recognize cleavage sites preferred by E.
          coliDNA topoisomerase I
          Previous studies have shown that 
          E. coli DNA topoisomerase I
          cleavage of single-stranded DNA occurs with selectivity
          for sites with the C nucleotide base at the - 4 position
          [ 9 10 ] and that the enzyme preferentially cleaves at
          junctions of double-stranded and single-stranded DNA [ 8
          ] . Several different 5'-end labeled substrates were
          prepared and used in cleavage assays to compare the
          cleavage sites selected by Top67 versus topoisomerase I.
          The results showed that with single-stranded substrates,
          Top67 also preferred cleavage sites with a C nucleotide
          base at the -4 position as reported for most of the type
          IA topoisomerases [ 12 ] . There were some differences
          from topoisomerase I in the relative distribution of
          cleavage products among the potential cleavage sites
          (Figure 4a,4b). Top67 appeared to be more
          non-discriminatory in selection of the possible cleavage
          sites with the C nucleotide in the -4 position. Addition
          of the ZD domain had no effect on the cleavage
          selectivity of Top67. A substrate with both
          single-stranded and double-stranded regions was
          constructed to mimic such junction in negatively
          supercoiled DNA. Top67 and topoisomerase I recognised the
          same cleavage site on this substrate (Figure 4c). Maximal
          yield of cleavage products was obtained for both Top67
          and topoisomerase I within seconds after mixing of the
          enzyme and DNA so any potential difference in cleavage
          rates between the Top67 and topoisomerase I is unlikely
          to account for the difference in relaxation
          efficiency.
        
        
          Top67 cleavage sites are religated upon addition of
          high salt and Mg 2+
          To test the religation capability of Top67, a 5'-end
          labeled oligonucleotide 61 base in length was first
          incubated with the enzyme in low ionic strength buffer to
          allow formation of the cleaved complex. Sodium chloride
          concentration was then increased to 1 M to induce
          reversal of cleavage and dissociation of the enzyme from
          the DNA. We observed that more complete and consistent
          reversal of cleavage was obtained with both topoisomerase
          I and Top67 if a low concentration of Mg 2+(4 mM) was
          also added with the NaCl. This is consistent with an
          early observation of dissociation of the enzyme-DNA
          complex in high salt upon addition of Mg 2+ [ 13 ] . It
          has also been reported [ 14 ] that addition of Mg 2+was
          apparently not required for observation of this reversal
          of cleavage. However, it is possible that some enzyme
          preparations may contain bound Mg 2+and the low
          concentration of bound Mg 2+might have been sufficient
          for reversal of cleavage, as postulated previously to
          explain the data [ 14 ] . The results of this cleavage
          reversal experiment (Figure 5) indicated that the ZD
          domain was not required for efficient reversal of
          cleavage and Top67 could carry out religation of cleaved
          DNA. Again the reversal of cleavage was complete for both
          Top67 and topoisomerase I within seconds after the
          addition of high salt and Mg 2+even when the reactions
          were carried out on ice (data not shown) so the lack of
          relaxation activity by Top67 is unlikely to be due to
          deficiency in religation.
        
        
          The ZD domain is not required for catenation of
          double-stranded DNA circles
          
          E. coli topoisomerase I can
          catalyze catenation of double-stranded DNA circles if the
          molecules contain single-strand scissions [ 15 16 ] . To
          test if the Top67 can carry out double-stranded DNA
          passage at enzyme cleavage sites across from the DNA
          nicks, the yield of DNA catenanes were compared with that
          obtained with topoisomerase I. In contrast to the
          relaxation activity, the catenating activity of Top67
          shown in figure 6was as efficient as that of full-length
          topoisomerase I, and the addition of the ZD domain had no
          effect (Figure 6a). The rate of catenane formation for
          Top67 alone was similar to that of topoisomerase I
          (Figure 6b). This catenation activity observed with
          topoisomerase I and Top67 was unlikely to be due to
          contaminating topoisomerase III activity since it was not
          observed with the ZD domain purified under almost
          identical procedures and a site-directed mutant with
          substitution of the active site Tyr319 by phenylalanine
          also did not exhibit this activity (Figure 6a).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        There are two homologous type IA topoisomerases present
        in 
        E. coli . Topoisomerase III has
        potent DNA decatenating activity for resolution of plasmid
        DNA replication intermediates, but much weaker relaxation
        activity than topoisomerase I [ 17 ] . To exhibit maximal
        relaxation activity, topoisomerase III requires high
        temperature (52°C) along with low magnesium and monovalent
        ion [ 17 18 ] . In contrast, 
        E. coli topoisomerase I was not
        active in the 
        in vitro assay for resolution of
        plasmid DNA replication intermediates [ 19 ] . Removal of
        the C-terminal 49 amino acids from the 653 amino acid
        topoisomerase III protein resulted in drastic reduction of
        catalytic activity [ 20 ] . Fusion of the carboxyl-terminal
        312 amino acid residues of 
        E. coli topoisomerase I, which
        includes the entire ZD domain, onto the 605 N-terminal
        amino acids of topoisomerase III generated a hybrid
        topoisomerase that has relaxation activity resembling
        topoisomerase III along with weak decatenating activity [
        21 ] . Although preferring single-stranded DNA as binding
        substrate, topoisomerase I had been shown to also bind
        double-stranded DNA [ 22 ] , but there is no data available
        to indicate which domain in the enzyme is responsible for
        this interaction.
        The experiments described here measured directly the
        interaction of the ZD domain with both double-stranded and
        single-stranded DNA substrates. ZD domain was found to bind
        to single-stranded DNA, but not double-stranded DNA, with
        high affinity. This result indicated that with regard to
        the mechanism of 
        E. coli topoisomerase I, the ZD
        domain was likely to function as a single-stranded DNA
        binding domain instead of having double-stranded DNA
        binding function as previously suggested [ 21 ] . Even
        though Zn(II) binding transcription factors that recognise
        specific double-stranded DNA are well represented in
        eukaryotes [ 23 24 ] , there are also numerous examples of
        Zn(II) coordination being required for interaction with
        single-stranded nucleic acid or damaged DNA with
        single-strand characteristics [ 24 25 26 27 ] .
        The effect of removal of the ZD domain on the individual
        step of enzyme action was also investigated using Top67.
        The results indicated that Top67 was effective in binding
        to both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA. As a
        result, Top67 could position itself in the absence of ZD
        domain at the junction of double- and single-stranded DNA
        for subsequent DNA cleavage, as previously observed for
        intact topoisomerase I [ 8 ] . Reversal of DNA cleavage
        also took place readily with Top67 upon addition of 1 M
        NaCl and 4 mM MgCl 
        2 . The ZD domain also was not required
        for selectivity of a cytosine in the -4 position relative
        to the cleavage sites.
        Despite its ability to recognise the DNA substrate and
        carry out DNA cleavage-religation, Top67 by itself cannot
        catalyze change of linking number in the relaxation of
        supercoiled DNA. The single-strand DNA substrate designated
        for the ZD domain in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme
        may be the strand of DNA complementary to the strand first
        cleaved by the enzyme to form the covalent complex. This
        interaction with the passing strand of DNA would not be
        needed for the first two steps of enzyme mechanism up to
        the formation of the covalent complex. Our results showed
        that adding the purified ZD domain partially restored the
        relaxation activity. Therefore the ZD domain can supply the
        function that is missing in Top67 even when the two domains
        are not covalently linked. However, the resulting
        relaxation activity is much less efficient than that of the
        intact enzyme, suggesting that coordinated actions of the
        two domains are required for efficient removal of negative
        supercoils from DNA. The requirement of specific
        protein-protein interactions between the two domains could
        also account for the weak relaxation activity observed for
        the hybrid topoisomerase with ZD linked to topoisomerase
        III sequence [ 21 ] .
        This proposed role for the ZD domain in interacting with
        the passing single-strand of DNA is also supported by the
        observation that there is no difference between Top67 and
        intact topoisomerase I in the formation of catenanes. This
        reaction involves passage of another double-stranded DNA
        circle, instead of the complementary DNA strand through the
        break generated by DNA cleavage so the ZD domain would not
        be expected to play any significant role. High
        concentration of DNA substrate is required to favor
        formation of catenanes catalyzed by topoisomerase I, and
        the enzyme also has to be present in higher concentration
        compared to the relaxation reaction. The double-stranded
        DNA-binding activity in 
        E. coli topoisomerase III required
        for highly efficient decatenation activity is attributed to
        a 17-amino-acid residue with no counterpart in 
        E. coli topoisomerase I [ 28 29 ] .
        It may be required for interaction with the passing
        double-strand of DNA in the decatenation mechanism. The
        presence of this decatenation loop instead of the Zn(II)
        binding ZD domain in topoisomerase III may account for the
        dominance of the decatenation activity over the relaxation
        activity.
        Based on these results, we propose a model for the
        relaxation of supercoiled DNA by 
        E. coli topoisomerase I (Figure 7)
        modified from previous versions that have a number of
        common features but differ most significantly in the role
        of the Zn(II) binding domain [ 2 4 21 29 30 ] . In this
        model, the subdomains in Top67 is responsible for
        interacting with the G-strand of DNA both upstream and
        downstream of the cleavage site. The ZD domain interacts
        with the passing single-strand DNA to be transported
        (T-strand). After cleavage of the DNA gate strand which
        becomes covalently linked to Tyr319 on Top67 (step 2),
        protein conformational change involving both Top67 and the
        ZD domain increases the distance between the covalently
        bound 5' phosphate and non-covalently bound 3' hydroxyl of
        the cleaved DNA gate strand while the passing DNA strand
        (T-strand) is guided through the "gate" via interaction
        with the ZD domain (step 3) to lead to change in linking
        number. A second enzyme conformational change positions the
        cleaved DNA ends for religation (step 4). The ZD domain can
        still interact with the T-strand of DNA even when not
        linked to Top67 in the same polypeptide, but efficiency of
        catalysis is reduced as a result, probably due to loss of
        coordinated action by the two domains. The presence of the
        ZD domain may enhance the transition of Top67 from a closed
        conformation to a more open conformation so that strand
        passage can take place through the "DNA gate". Previous
        data showed that although Zn(II) binding is not absolutely
        required for formation of the cleaved complex, it increased
        the amount of cleaved complex that can be isolated [ 31 ] .
        When linked to Top67, the ZD domain also has some influence
        on the cleavage site selections. It has previously been
        observed that a mutation in the Zn(II) binding motif can
        affect the cleavage site selectivity of topoisomerase I [
        32 ] even though Top67 by itself can recognize both the
        cytosine in the -4 position and the junction of single- and
        double-stranded DNA. To gain further details for this model
        of enzyme action, we are characterizing the protein-protein
        interactions between the Top67 transesterification domain
        and the ZD domain, as well as the protein conformational
        changes that can take place when the enzyme interacts with
        DNA substrate.
        The hyperthermophilic topoisomerase I from 
        Thermotoga maritima has been shown to
        coordinate one Zn(II) with a unique tetracysteine motif
        Cys-X-Cys-X 
        16 -Cys-X-Cys but Zn(II) binding is not
        required for relaxation activity [ 33 ] . The sequence of
        this unique tetracysteine motifs is somewhat different from
        those present in other type IA topoisomerases in that the
        other tetracysteine motifs always had at least two amino
        acids separating the pairs of cysteines (Cys-X 
        2-11 -Cys), instead of just one amino
        acid (Cys-X-Cys) in 
        T. maritima topoisomerase I [ 33 ] .
        Therefore the structure and function of the single Zn(II)
        binding motif in 
        T. maritima may differ from the
        multiple Zn(II) binding motifs in 
        E. coli topoisomerase I. Direct
        interaction between DNA and the 
        T. maritima Zn(II) binding motif has
        not been demonstrated. It has been suggested that the
        mechanisms of these two enzymes may be different [ 33 ] .
        Direct interaction between the enzyme and the passing
        strand may not be necessary for the 
        T. maritima topoisomerase I activity.
        The relaxation and decatenation activities of 
        T. maritima topoisomerase I appear to
        be significantly more efficient than those of the 
        E. coli topoisomerase I [ 33 ] .
        Based on their primary sequences, a number of bacterial
        topoisomerase I enzymes do not appear to coordinate any
        Zn(II) with tetracysteines motifs while other type IA
        topoisomerase has up to 4 tetracysteine motifs [ 7 ] . The
        topoisomerase I from 
        Mycobacterium smegmatis has been
        demonstrated biochemically not to bind Zn(II) [ 34 ] . In
        contrast, mutation disrupting the fourth Zn(II) motif of 
        Helicobacter pylori topoisomerase I
        abolished enzyme function 
        in vivo [ 35 ] . Therefore there may
        be significant differences in the mechanisms of type IA
        topoisomerases from different organisms with respect to
        requirement of Zn(II) binding for relaxation activity.
        There is also another possible explanation for the
        varied number of tetracysteine motifs and requirement of
        Zn(II) for relaxation activity found in different type IA
        topoisomerases. The 14 kDa C-terminal region of 
        E. coli topoisomerase I has been
        classified based on its structure to be in the Zn-ribbon
        superfamily [SCOP release 1.50, 7] even though it does not
        bind Zn(II). It also has high affinity for binding to
        single-stranded DNA on its own when separated from the
        three tetracysteine motifs [ 36 ] . Based on the structural
        and DNA-binding properties of the 
        E. coli topoisomerase I 14 kDa
        domain, one can conclude that it is possible for a
        subdomain in topoisomerase I to lose the Zn(II) binding
        cysteines during evolution and still maintains the
        Zn-ribbon structure and single-strand DNA binding
        properties [ 7 ] .
        Finally, the 
        in vivo catalytic activities of
        eukarytotic type IA topoisomerases, the topoisomerase III
        from various higher organisms may be related to their
        sequences. The transesterification domains of these
        eukaryotic enzymes have high degrees of identity to 
        E. coli DNA topoisomerase III [ 7 37
        ] . However, the decatenation loop is not present in the
        eukaryotic topoisomerase III sequences and to date the
        decatenation activity has not been demonstrated for these
        enzymes. The number of potential Zn(II) binding cysteine
        motifs range from none in 
        S. cerevisiae DNA topoisomerase III
        to four highly conserved tetracysteine motifs in the beta
        family of the topoisomerase III enzymes [ 38 ] . The Zn(II)
        domain formed by these tetracysteine motifs may be required
        for interaction with single-strand DNA in removal of
        hypernegative supercoils [ 39 ] or disruption of early
        recombination intermediates between inappropriately paired
        DNA molecules [ 40 ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have shown that the ZD domain of 
        E. coli DNA topoisomerase I is not
        required for the substrate recognition and DNA
        cleavage-religation action of the enzyme. We propose that
        the ZD domain interacts with the passing single-strand of
        DNA in the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA by this
        enzyme.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Enzyme and DNA
          
          E. coli DNA topoisomerase I and the
          ZD domain were expressed and purified as described [ 6 41
          ] . To express the 67 kDa N-terminal transesterification
          domain (Top67), a stop codon at amino acid 598 was
          introduced into plasmid pJW312 [ 42 ] used for
          topoisomerase I expression by site-directed mutagenesis
          employing the Chameleon-Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene.
          Top67 was expressed and purified with the same procedures
          as topoisomerase I.
          The oligonucleotides were custom synthesized by
          Genosys. The single-strand substrates and the top strand
          of the duplex substrates were labeled at the 5' termini
          with T4 polynucleotide kinase and γ 32P-ATP. The labeled
          oligonucleotides were purified by electrophoresis in a 12
          or 15% sequencing gel. After elution from the gel slice,
          the labeled single-stranded oligonucleotides were
          desalted by centrifugation through a Sephadex G10 spin
          column.
          The duplex or heteroduplex substrates were prepared by
          mixing the labeled top strand with 4 fold excess of the
          unlabeled bottom strand, heating at 80°C for three
          minutes, cooling to room temperature and purified by
          electrophoresis in a 20% non-denaturing polyacrylamide
          gel with TBE buffer.
          Plasmid pJW312 DNA used in relaxation assay was
          purified by CsCl centrifugation. Phage PM2 DNA was
          extracted from infected 
          Pseudoalteromonas espejiana cells [
          43 ] and PM2 DNA with one or more single-chain scissions
          used in the catenation assay was prepared as described [
          44 ] .
        
        
          DNA relaxation assay
          Top67 and the ZD domains at different concentrations
          were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 10 min before
          addition to the 0.3 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA in 20
          μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 mM MgCl 
          2 , 0.1 mg/ml gelatin. After
          incubation at 37°C for up to 1 h, the reaction was
          stopped by addition of 50 mM EDTA and electrophoresed in
          a 0.7% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide
          staining as described [ 45 ] .
        
        
          Gel mobility shift assay
          The proteins were mixed with the 1 pmole of the
          labeled DNA substrates in 10 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,
          100 μg/ml BSA, 12% glycerol and 0.5 mM EDTA. The samples
          were incubated at 37°C for 5 min and then loaded onto a
          6% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed with buffer of
          45 mM Tris-borate pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA. Electrophoresis was
          carried out at room temperature at 2 V/cm for 2 h. After
          drying of the gel, bands corresponding to the
          protein-bound oligonucleotides and unbound
          oligonucleotides were visualized by autoradiography,
          excised and counted in a Scintillation counter for
          quantitation.
        
        
          DNA cleavage assay
          The cleavage assays were carried out with 1 pmole of
          5' 32P-end labeled DNA substrate and 5-10 pmoles of
          topoisomerase I or Top67 in 10 μl of the buffer used for
          the gel mobility shift assay. After incubation at 37°C
          for up to 20 min, an equal volume of 90% formamide, 10 mM
          KOH, 0.25% bromophenol blue and 0.25% xylene cyanol was
          added to stop the reactions. The samples were analyzed by
          electrophoresis in a 12% sequencing gel followed by
          autoradiography.
        
        
          Salt and Mg 2+induced reversal of cleavage
          The conditions were modified from those described
          previously [ 14 ] . The cleavage reactions were incubated
          at 37°C for 5 min and then divided into three aliquots.
          The cleavage products were trapped in one aliquot by the
          addition of SDS to 1%. NaCl (1 M) alone or NaCl with MgCl
          
          2 (4 mM) were added to the other
          aliquots followed by further incubation at 37°C for up to
          30 min before the addition of SDS. The products were
          analyzed as described for the cleavage reactions.
        
        
          Catenation of nicked DNA circles
          The catenation reaction was carried out with 1.4 μg of
          nicked PM2 phage DNA in 20 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
          0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 
          2 . After incubation at 37°C for up
          to1 h, the reactions were stopped with the addition of 1%
          SDS and 50 mM EDTA. The products were analyzed as
          described for the relaxation assay.
