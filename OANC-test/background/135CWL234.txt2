      Thank you for your interest in Children's Harbor.
      I'm enclosing some information on Children's Harbor which I hope
      you'll find interesting. We were founded in 1989 by Ben and Luanne
      Russell who wanted to do something special for children here on Lake
      Martin. Our mission is to strengthen children and families, and we are
      now focusing our resources on children who have long-term, serious
      illnesses and their families. We provide free counseling and support
      services to them through our office in Birmingham, and we have camping
      and adventure services for them here on our Lake Martin Campus.
      Unfortunately, There are over 1,000 families each year who have a
      child diagnosed with a serious illness at Children's Hospital of Alabama.
      The names of these illnesses are some of the most feared in our society:
      cancer, cystic fibrosis, renal failure - just to name a few. Children's
      Harbor is working with many of these children and their families to help
      them cope with the changes brought on by a chronic illness and to help
      them lead productive lives both now and in the future
      We are privately funded by thousands of individuals, clubs,
      businesses, churches, foundations -and others. Our founders underwrite
      administrative and fundraising costs so that other contributions go to
      provide services to the, children and their families.
      If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call or e-mail
      me.
      Sincerely
      Marilyn J. Ray Director of Public Relations and Financial
      Development
