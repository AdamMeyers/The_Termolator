      Dear (Greetings):
      It is with great pleasure that I take this opportunity to share with
      our YMCA family some of the wonderful activities and accomplishments of
      the International Committee in 1998. We continue to stay active in
      Eastern Europe, in the rebuilding of life in Liberia, and with our Sioux
      Indian YMCA, sharing the strengths that each of us possess, so as to
      strengthen both of us in the process. The life-changing experiences that
      are made possible because of YMCA International work will remain with the
      youth and adults who participate for a lifetime! Thank you in advance for
      helping to keep our outreach and exchange alive!
      Please take a moment to look over the highlights of 1998!
      Partnership with YMCA of Liberia - In 1998, we continued our efforts
      to help the YMCA of Liberia re-establish after 7 years of civil war.
      Thanks to a generous contribution from the Society of Retired YMCA
      Executives, partial funding was made available for us to host an
      International Camp Counselor from the Liberia YMCA. Eugenia Langford, a
      staff member of the Liberia YMCA, spent the entire summer working at the
      Ruth Lilly YMCA Outdoor Center. While there, she was provided with
      program, leadership, and management training and experiences and a wide
      variety of opportunities to work in various roles at the center.
      Partnership with Latvia YMCA - A delegation of three staff members and
      one volunteer from the YMCA of Greater Indianapolis traveled to Latvia in
      late April to provide additional training to their staff and volunteers
      in baseball skills and camp management. A highlight of their trip was
      visiting a new, remote YMCA location and helping them get started with
      their programs. The Ruth Lilly YMCA Outdoor Center hosted an
      International Camp Counselor from Latvia for the summer and three young
      adults from Latvia were our guests this summer for three weeks to
      participate in the YMCA World Camp program.
      World Alliance of YMCAs - Craig Wells, long time member of the YMCA of
      Greater Indianapolis International Committee, was nominated to represent
      the YMCA of the USA as a young adult delegate to the 14th World Council
      in France, Germany in July. As a result of his participation, he was
      nominated to join the YMCA of the USA's International Committee.
      World Camp 1998 - The YMCA of Greater Indianapolis hosted 9
      International young adults - 3 from Egypt, 1 from Liberia, 4 from Latvia,
      and 1 from Australia - this summer for World Camp 1998. During their
      visit with us, they worked at resident and day camps, enjoyed homestays,
      toured the Indianapolis area, and visited YMCA branches. The highlight of
      their experience in the United States occurred August 16-22, when the
      International guests and their American partners attended a regional
      World Camp program at YMCA Camp Potawotami in Fort Wayne, IN.
      Sioux Indiana Cultural Immersion Program -- Board Member Susie Davis
      and staff member, Andy Hill led a delegation of teens who spent a week at
      the Sioux Indiana YMCA in S. Dakota for the second year in a row. Susie
      Davis received an Outstanding International Leader Award from the YMCA of
      the USA for creating this program in 1997. The YMCA of the USA also named
      it an Outstanding International Program in 1997.
      YMCA International Conference -- Four delegates (3 volunteers and 1
      staff attended the YMCA International Conference in Toronto, Canada in
      October. Representatives from 43 different countries were in attendance.
      Workshops focused in YMCA initiatives around the globe such as: community
      development, refugee relief, teen programs, youth sports, exchanges, and
      much more. While there, the delegation spent extended periods of time
      with Peter Kamei, General Secretary (Director) of our partner YMCA in
      Liberia.
      World Service Fund Raising -- All YMCA International Programs and
      World Service Projects are funded through special fund raising efforts of
      the branches and the International Committee. The primary funding source
      is the YMCA International Open, which will be held next year on Thursday,
      July 15, 1999 at noon at Pebble Brook Golf Club. Please call 266-9622 and
      ask for Mary to register your foursome early.
      I hope that you agree that these activities are essential to being a
      part of a world community. The most important way to express that
      approval is through a financial contribution to support the work of the
      International Committee. Your support is vital and your generosity will
      make a real difference.
      "Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses,
      let us lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let
      us run with perseverance the race that is set before us..." Hebrews
      12:1-2 With best wishes for the Holidays,
