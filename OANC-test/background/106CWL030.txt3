      Why should you give $25 to the American Cancer Society?
      If you have had cancer, you already know why. If you had relatives or
      close friends with cancer, you will appreciate our request for money.
      If you have been fortunate thus far, let me explain our need for your
      $25 donation.
      Over __ people each year in __ county are diagnosed as having cancer.
      One out of every four people in the United States will be diagnosed with
      having cancer at one point and time in their life. However, preventive
      measures can reduce the chances of one's contracting cancer.
      Knowledge is a result of research which requires money, and your $25
      donation (or more, if you can) will assure continuation of this research.
      It's your are concerned about. Please use the enclosed envelope so we can
      help you.
      Sincerely,
      O.K. Corral President My Unit
      P.S. --- Enclosed please find a booklet containing lifesaving
      information.
