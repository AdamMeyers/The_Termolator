      Dear FIELD(contact person),
      My name is Joe Cooper. Last year I was so proud to be named student of
      the year that I thought my chest was going to burst when I was on stage.
      I learned first hand what GILL is all about, giving to others
      unselfishly. This year at the GILL Recognition Party on April 18, 1998
      there was a silent auction sponsored by the students. We as students
      thank you for donating FIELD (we got 98) for the auction.
      I truly believe God had a purpose for me when I walked into the Marion
      County Library and asked the librarian if she could teach me to read. It
      was like a guardian angel had come down to guide my feet into that door
      when she directed me to GILL. I can not begin to tell you how GILL has
      changed my life. All of the staff and my tutor have been so friendly and
      helpful they made me realize that I am a worthwhile human being. I don't
      know why God chose me. I just know he did and I plan to make something of
      my life with GILLâ€™s help. I volunteer for student meetings,
      Leadership Council and speaking engagements.
      Your gift is appreciated by each and every student who will benefit
      from your generosity. GILL truly does make a difference in lives.
      
      Again, I thank you.

      P.S. It took me 1 and 1/2 hours to type this on the computer because
      my writing skills need a lot of practice yet, but my tutor helped me with
      only a few words. She is a drill sergeant making me do all the work!
