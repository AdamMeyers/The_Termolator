      important work of the American Cancer Society.
      I know that as an important business and community leader, you are
      frequently deluged with requests for funds from worthwhile organizations.
      The American Cancer Society is, of course, such an organization, but it
      is much more than just that. It is the one private, volunteer
      organization that exists to end the menace of cancer, to ease the pain of
      cancer victims and their families, to rehabilitate those who survive, and
      to enlighten and inform both the professional world and lay public about
      the latest developments in cancer.
      Support is needed both to maintain and expand these comprehensive
      programs. Please help the American Cancer Society continue its vital
      work. I would most appreciate receiving your generous check made payable
      to the American Cancer Society and sent to me in the enclosed envelope,
      if you have not already done so.
      Thank you very much.
      Sincerely yours,
