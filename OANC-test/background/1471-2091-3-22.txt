        The ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolysis system
        has been implicated in a wide variety of cellular
        regulatory mechanisms, including transcription, signal
        transduction, and cell cycle control (reviewed in [ 1 ] ).
        The system employs a cascade of enzymatic reactions that
        lead to the covalent attachment of a chain of multiple
        ubiquitins to substrate proteins [ 2 ] . In many cases,
        modification by ubiquityl moieties targets proteins to the
        proteasome, ultimately resulting in their degradation. The
        ubiquitylation reaction involves a minimum of three
        enzymes: An E1, which mediates the ATP-dependent activation
        of ubiquitin, and an E2, or ubiquitin conjugating enzyme
        (UBC), which, together with an E3 ubiquitin ligase,
        transfers ubiquitin to the target protein. E3 enzymes are
        of particular interest, as they mediate the substrate
        specificity of ubiquitylation reactions.
        Studies in budding yeast identified SCF Cdc4p, an E3
        ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates the ubiquitylation
        of the CDK inhibitor Sic1p [ 3 4 ] . SCF Cdc4pconsists of
        at least four proteins: the cullin Cdc53p, the RING domain
        protein Hrt1p/Rbx1p/Roc1p, the adapter protein Skp1p, and
        Cdc4p (reviewed in [ 1 ] ). Cdc4p contains two sequence
        motifs, which are conserved in a wide variety of so-called
        F-box proteins: C-terminal WD-repeats that are involved in
        binding the substrate Sic1p in a phosphorylation-dependent
        manner, and a central F-box [ 5 ] that interacts with Skp1p
        [ 6 7 ] . Cdc53p in turn binds to Skp1p and
        Hrt1p/Rbx1p/Roc1p, which bridges Cdc53p with the
        ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34p/Ubc3p [ 6 8 9 10 11 12
        ] . 
        In vitro reconstitution demonstrated
        that SCF Cdc4p, Cdc34p, E1, ubiquitin, and ATP are
        sufficient to mediate Sic1p polyubiquitylation [ 6 7 ]
        .
        Components of the SCF system are widely conserved in
        eukaryotes [ 1 3 ] . In human cells, for example, SCF
        Skp2mediates destruction of the CDK inhibitor p27 [ 13 14 ]
        , while SCF β-TRCPtargets IκB [ 15 16 17 ] . All of these
        SCF complexes share homologues of the core components
        CDC53/CUL1, SKP1, and HRT1/RBX1/ROC1, which associate with
        different F-box proteins.
        Several lines of evidence suggest that the SCF pathway
        is also conserved in the fission yeast 
        Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Pcu1p, a
        Cdc53p/CUL1-related protein, was shown to associate with
        two different F-box/WD repeat proteins, Pop1p and Pop2p,
        when overexpressed [ 18 ] . In addition, genetic studies
        demonstrated that both of these F-box proteins are
        simultaneously required for efficient destruction of Rum1p
        and the replication initiator Cdc18p [ 18 19 20 ] . Rum1p
        is a Sic1p-analogous CDK inhibitor, which accumulates in
        G1, but is degraded as cells enter S phase [ 21 22 ] .
        Failure to degrade Rum1p is the major phenotypic defect of 
        pop1 and 
        pop2 deletion strains, which leads to
        disturbance of normal cell cycle progression, resulting in
        polyploidy [ 18 19 20 23 ] . Based on the genetic data and
        the biochemical observation that Pop1p and Pop2p interact
        when overexpressed, a putative SCF Pop1p-Pop2pcomplex was
        proposed, which would contain the heterooligomerizing F-box
        proteins Pop1p and Pop2p bound to SCF core components [ 18
        20 ] .
        Whether this unusual heterooligomeric SCF
        Pop1p-Pop2pcomplex exists 
        in vivo and whether it mediates Rum1p
        ubiquitylation, remained unproven, as not all fission yeast
        SCF core subunits were identified. In addition, based on
        overexpression, distinct SCF Pop1pand SCF Pop2pcomplexes
        were proposed to target unknown substrates, but no
        biochemical evidence of their activity was provided [ 18 ]
        . To address these questions, we cloned two additional
        subunits of SCF Popand performed a detailed
        characterization of its activity 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo . Our results indicate that
        heterooligomeric SCF Pop1p-Pop2pmediates Rum1p
        ubiquitylation whereas distinct SCF Pop1pand SCF
        Pop2pcomplexes target unknown nuclear and cytoplasmic
        substrates, thereby generating combinatorial diversity of
        SCF function in fission yeast.
      
      
        Results
        
          Composition of SCF Pop1p-Pop2p
          Based on the composition of known SCF complexes, we
          identified in the 
          S. pombe genome database 
          psh1 (pombe skp1 homologue) and 
          pip1 (pop interacting protein 1),
          two genes encoding proteins with strong similarity to
          human SKP1 and HRT1/RBX1/ROC1, respectively (data not
          shown). Consistent with these proteins being components
          of the putative SCF Pop1p-Pop2pcomplex, they all
          co-purified with Pop1p, Pop2p, and Pcu1p when
          overexpressed pairwise (data not shown).
          Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using affinity
          purified rabbit antisera confirmed these interactions at
          the level of the endogenous proteins. While each of the
          five antisera co-precipitated at least one of the other
          subunits, Pip1p, Pop1p, and Pop2p antisera
          co-precipitated all five proteins from wild-type cell
          lysate (Fig. 1A). Size fractionation of total cell
          lysates prior to immunoprecipitation revealed co-elution
          of Pip1p with Pop1p, Pop2p, Pcu1p, and Psh1p in a high
          molecular weight complex of approximately 500 kDa, which
          we refer to as SCF Pop1p-Pop2p(Fig. 1B). The composition
          of the core complex Pip1p/Pcu1p/Psh1p did not undergo
          major variations during the cell cycle (Fig. 1C). We have
          carefully reexamined potential cell cycle variations of
          Pcu1p neddylation apparent in the IP/immunoblotting
          experiment in Fig. 1C. These variations were not seen
          when samples were denatured in SDS immediately following
          extract preparation (data not shown), suggesting that
          they arise from varying degrees of deneddylation
          presumably occuring during the immunoprecipitation step.
          In addition, in a separate experiment, Pop1p-Pop2p
          heterooligomerization was largely constant during the
          cell cycle (Fig. 1C). These findings indicated that cell
          cycle-dependent substrate degradation is unlikely to be
          controlled at the level of SCF Pop1p-Pop2pcomplex
          formation.
        
        
          SCF Pop1p-Pop2pmediates polyubiquitylation of Rum1p
          in vitro
          Genetic experiments suggested that degradation of
          Rum1p depends on the Pop1p and Pop2p F-box proteins [ 18
          20 ] , but also requires phosphorylation of Rum1p on
          serine 58 and threonine 62 by cyclin-dependent kinase
          (CDK) [ 21 ] . Thus, phosphorylated Rum1p may be a
          substrate for SCF Pop1p-Pop2p-mediated
          polyubiquitylation. To test this, we first confirmed that
          Rum1p is an 
          in vitro substrate for the Cdc2p
          kinase in association with the cyclin Cig1p [ 21 ] as
          judged by a mobility shift on SDS gels (Fig. 2A).
          Bacterially expressed Rum1p purified to apparent
          homogeneity was also efficiently phosphorylated by
          Cdc2p/Cig1p complexes (Fig. 2A).
          To determine whether phosphorylated Rum1p interacts
          with Pop1p and Pop2p, protein lysate was prepared from
          cells co-overexpressing epitope-tagged combinations of
          Pop1p and Pop2p. Upon affinity purification on Ni-NTA
          resin, HA-Pop1p/His-Myc-Pop2p complexes were incubated
          with bacterially expressed, phosphorylated Rum1p. In this
          reaction, Pop1p-Pop2p complexes specifically bound
          phosphorylated Rum1p (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Consistent with
          the genetic data [ 20 ] , His-Myc-Pop1p and His-Myc-Pop2p
          individually purified upon overexpression in 
          pop1 pop2 double mutants exhibited
          no Rum1p binding above background (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and
          3).
          Given our ability to prepare immunopurified SCF
          Pop1p-Pop2pthat bound phosphorylated Rum1p, we sought to
          reconstitute Rum1p polyubiquitylation 
          in vitro. In addition, we required
          an ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) and an ubiquitin
          conjugating enzyme (UBC). While human E1 is highly
          similar to its fission yeast counterpart (data not
          shown), inspection of the 
          S. pombe genome revealed fourteen
          potential UBCs, none of which is an obvious homologue of
          human UBC3 or budding yeast Cdc34p, since all lack the
          characteristic C-terminal extension (data not shown). We
          therefore purified recombinant human E1 and UBC3 (CDC34)
          upon expression in bacteria (Fig. 2C).
          In the presence of human E1, UBC3, ubiquitin, and ATP,
          SCF Pop1p-Pop2pcomplexes immunopurified with Pip1p
          antibodies converted a small portion of phosphorylated
          Rum1p into high molecular weight species (Fig. 2D). This
          conversion was dependent on the addition of E1, ATP (data
          not shown), and wild-type UBC3 (Fig. 2D, lanes 2,4,6).
          The activity of SCF Pop1p/Pop2pwas augmented when Pip1p
          complexes where purified from 
          csn5 mutants (Fig. 2D, lane 5).
          This mutant accumulates Pcu1p exclusively in a form
          carrying the stimulatory Nedd8p modification, due to a
          defect in COP9/signalosome-mediated cullin deneddylation
          [ 24 25 ] . Replacing wild-type ubiquitin by a mutant
          lacking all lysine residues prevented the formation of
          high molecular weight products (Fig. 2D, lane 7),
          indicating that they represent polyubiquitylated Rum1p
          species generated in the reaction. Similar
          polyubiquitylated reaction products were detected upon
          incubation of phosphorylated Rum1p with Pcu1p
          immunocomplexes, further suggesting that the activity is
          mediated by SCF Pop1p-Pop2p(data not shown). Moreover,
          Rum1p ubiquitylation was not obtained with Pip1p
          complexes prepared from cell lysate of 
          pop2 deletion strains, proving the
          F-box protein dependency of this reaction (Fig. 2D, lane
          3). In addition, the reaction was specific for human
          UBC3, as no ubiquitylation was obtained with fission
          yeast Ubc1p, Ubc7p, Ubc11p, or Ubc13p (Fig. 2, lanes
          10,11). Taken together these results strongly suggest
          that SCF Pop1p-Pop2pmediates the polyubiquitylation of
          CDK phosphorylated Rum1p 
          in vitro .
        
        
          Differential subcellular localization of SCF
          Pop1p-Pop2psubunits
          The co-purification of the five identified SCF
          Pop1p-Pop2psubunits and their 
          in vitro activity toward Rum1p
          suggested that they coexist in a common subcellular
          compartment. The nuclear localization of the only known
          substrates, Cdc18p [ 26 ] and Rum1p (D.A.W.,
          unpublished), indicated that a substantial portion of SCF
          Pop1p-Pop2pis enriched in the nucleus. To test this
          assumption, all five SCF Pop1p-Pop2psubunits were
          expressed as fusion proteins with green fluorescent
          protein (GFP) at low levels from an inducible pRep81
          plasmid. While Pip1p, Psh1p, Pcu1p, and Pop2p were
          present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus,
          surprisingly, GFP-Pop1p was largely restricted to the
          nucleus (Fig. 3A). These localization patterns were
          consistently observed in each single cell of an
          asynchronous population, excluding major variations
          during the cell cycle.
          To rule out the possibility that overexpression or
          N-terminal fusion to GFP affects their localization,
          Pop1p and Pop2p were modified with 13 C-terminal Myc
          epitope-tags at the endogenous genomic locus.
          Immunoblotting proved the expression of correctly sized
          proteins and, in addition, showed that endogenous Pop1p
          is approximately twofold more abundant in 
          S. pombe cells than Pop2p (Fig.
          3B). Indirect immunofluorescence staining with Myc
          antibodies confirmed that Pop1p is predominantly
          localized to cell nuclei, whereas Pop2p is expressed in
          both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 3C).
          To confirm these localization patterns, cells derived
          from the epitope-tagged strains were biochemically
          fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear components. The
          efficiency of enrichment of nuclear and cytoplasmic
          components was estimated by analyzing fractions with
          antibodies recognizing the nuclear marker PCNA and
          cytoplasmic tubulin (Fig. 3D). Although both fractions
          showed some contamination, Pop1p was detected mostly in
          nuclear fractions, while Pop2p was apparent in both
          nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 3D). Thus, all
          five SCF Pop1p-Pop2psubunits appear to coexist in the
          nucleus, although all but Pop1p are also present in the
          cytoplasm.
          Since Pop1p and Pop2p interact with each other [ 20 ]
          , we asked whether their localization patterns depended
          on the presence of the respective interaction partner.
          For this, we created a 
          pop2 deletion strain carrying Pop1p
          modified with 13 Myc epitope tags at the endogenous
          genomic locus ( 
          pop1-13myc Δpop2 strain ). In
          addition, we created the reciprocal 
          pop2-13myc Δpop1 strain containing
          epitope-tagged endogenous Pop2p in a 
          pop1 deletion background. The
          distinct localization patterns of Pop1p-13Myc and
          Pop2p-13Myc were fully maintained in these strains (Fig.
          3E). This observation was confirmed by overexpressing
          GFP-tagged Pop1p or Pop2p in 
          pop1 pop2 double deletion mutants
          (data not shown). These data indicate that Pop1p and
          Pop2p assume their subcellular localization pattern
          independent of each other, indicating the possibility of
          distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic homooligomeric SCF
          Pop1pand SCF Pop2pcomplexes.
        
        
          Differential F-box requirements of Pop1p and
          Pop2p
          As shown above and in previous genetic work [ 18 20 ]
          , SCF Pop1p-Pop2p-dependent Rum1p degradation requires
          two different proteins with highly conserved F-boxes
          (Fig. 4A). To better understand the apparent dual F-box
          requirement for SCF Pop1p-Pop2pfunction, we generated
          mutants of Pop1p and Pop2p lacking F-boxes (Pop1p-ΔF,
          Pop2p-ΔF; Fig. 4B). In addition, we prepared a set of
          mutants, in which the F-boxes of Pop1p and Pop2p were
          swapped (Pop1p-2F, Pop2p-1F; Fig. 4B). The mutants were
          tested for their ability to suppress polyploidy and Rum1p
          accumulation in the respective 
          pop mutant strains.
          As described previously [ 20 ] , wild-type Pop1p
          mildly overexpressed from a pRep81 plasmid fully
          complemented the polyploidization phenotype of 
          pop1 mutants as determined by flow
          cytometric measurement of the cellular DNA content (Fig
          4C). In addition, Rum1p accumulation in 
          pop1 mutants was efficiently
          reversed by wild-type Pop1p (Fig. 4D). In contrast, Pop1p
          lacking its F-box (Pop1p-ΔF) or Pop1p, in which the F-box
          was replaced by the F-box of Pop2p (Pop1p-2F) were
          largely inactive in both assays (Fig. 4C,4D). Thus, as
          with many other F-box proteins, the F-box of Pop1p is
          essential for its 
          in vivo functions.
          In contrast, wild-type Pop2p, the corresponding F-box
          mutant, and Pop2p containing the Pop1p F-box were equally
          effective in preventing Rum1p accumulation (Fig. 4D). The
          same wild-type and mutant proteins also reversed the mild
          polyploidy phenotype of 
          pop2 disruptants (Fig. 4C). Thus,
          in contrast to Pop1p, Pop2p does not seem, to require its
          F-box to mediate Rum1p degradation 
          in vivo .
          To further substantiate this conclusion, we examined
          Rum1p protein stability in wild-type and 
          pop mutant strains expressing
          F-box-deleted Pop proteins from the weak pRep81 promoter.
          Since the sensitivity of our Rum1p sera was insufficient
          to detect the low levels present in wild-type cells (see
          Fig. 4D, lane 9), these experiments were conducted in a
          background where endogenous Rum1p was modified with 13
          C-terminal c-Myc epitope tags. Rum1p half-life was
          increased from ~20 minutes in wild-type to greater than
          100 minutes in 
          pop1 or 
          pop2 mutants (Fig. 5). While F-box
          deleted Pop2p expressed from plasmids reduced Rum1p
          half-life to ~20 minutes in 
          pop2 mutants, F-box-deleted Pop1p
          was completely defective in rescuing the Rum1p
          proteolysis defect of 
          pop1 mutants (Fig. 5). Instead,
          expression of Pop1p-ΔF in 
          pop1 mutants led to even greater
          stabilization of Rum1p, potentially due to dominant
          negative interference with the residual activity of Pop2p
          and/or other F-box proteins.
        
        
          F-box independent interaction of Pop1p and
          Pop2p
          The failure of the Pop2p F-box to replace the F-box of
          Pop1p as well as the finding that it is not essential for
          Rum1p degradation could be explained, if it was not
          critically involved in SCF Pop1p-Pop2pprotein
          interactions. We therefore tested the possibility that
          Pop2p can be tethered to the SCF core complex
          independently of its F-box via an interaction with Pop1p.
          Consistent with this hypothesis, co-immunoprecipitation
          experiments of overexpressed proteins revealed that the
          Pop1p-Pop2p interaction occurs independently of the
          F-boxes of both Pop1p and Pop2p (Fig. 6A).
          We had previously mapped the domain of Pop2p that
          interacts with Pop1p to an N-terminal fragment consisting
          of the first 241 amino acids and lacking the F-box ( [ 20
          ] , Fig. 6B, lane 8). In co-immunoprecipitation
          experiments with overexpressed proteins, this fragment
          also bound to an N-terminal piece containing the first
          402 residues of Pop1p (Fig. 6B, lane 12). Thus, the
          Pop1p-Pop2p interaction is mediated by their N-terminal
          domains. A further truncation mutant mapped the Pop2p
          binding domain to a region between residues 228 and 402
          of Pop1p (Fig. 6B, lanes 9,10).
        
        
          Individual SCF Pop1pand SCF Pop2pcomplexes bearing
          ubiquitin ligase activity
          The apparent dispensibility of the F-box of Pop2p for
          Rum1p degradation and binding to Pop1p raised the
          question of why Pop2p does contain an F-box. Based on the
          subcellular localization data, we considered the
          possibility that the F-box of Pop2p may mediate the
          assembly of a cytoplasmically localized SCF Pop2pcomplex,
          independent of Pop1p. To demonstrate this, we again used
          the strain in which endogenous Pop2p was modified by 13
          Myc epitope tags in a 
          pop1 deletion background. The same
          experiments were carried out with the reverse stain,
          which contained Pop1p-13Myc in a 
          pop2 background. As a reference for
          SCF Popcomplex formation, we used strains carrying 13Myc
          epitope-tagged Pop1p or Pop2p integrated into the genome
          of wild-type cells.
          Pip1p immunoprecipitates were prepared from lysates of
          these four strains and appropriate controls, and
          co-purification of SCF components was determined by
          immunoblotting. These experiments showed that both F-box
          proteins, in the absence of their respective
          heterooligomerization partner, could individually bind to
          Pip1p in complexes that also contained Psh1p and Pcu1p
          (Fig. 7A). These findings indicate the existence of
          distinct SCF Pop1pand SCF Pop2pcomplexes 
          in vivo .
          To further substantiate this conclusion, we used gel
          filtration to compare the elution profiles of Pop1p and
          Pop2p in the presence or absence of their respective
          dimerization partners. If recruitment of Pop2p into a
          high molecular weight SCF complex required
          heterooligomerization with Pop1p, its elution profile
          would be expected to shift to a smaller size in the
          absence of Pop1p. Consistent with the results presented
          in Fig. 1C, Pop2p, together with SCF core subunits,
          eluted in fractions corresponding to 400 - 600 kDa,
          irrespective of whether Pop1p was present or not (Fig.
          7B). In the reverse experiment, the elution profile of
          Pop1p was found to be independent of the presence of
          Pop2p (Fig. 7B).
          While these data support the existence of distinct SCF
          Pop1pand SCF Pop2pcomplexes, individual binding of Pop1p
          and Pop2p to SCF core components in the absence of their
          heterodimerizing F-box protein partners does not rule out
          the possibility that these complexes represent inactive
          intermediates formed during the normal assembly of
          functional SCF Pop1p-Pop2pcomplexes. To exclude this
          possibility, we asked whether distinct SCF Pop1pand SCF
          Pop2pcomplexes bear ubiquitin ligase activity 
          in vitro . To this end, we
          performed 
          in vitro ubiquitylation assays.
          Since the substrates of putative SCF Pop1pand SCF
          Pop2pubiquitin ligases are unknown, we adopted a
          substrate-independent assay originally described by
          Lyapina 
          et al . [ 27 ] . For this
          experiment, we again used the strains harboring
          genomically integrated Myc epitope-tagged Pop1p or Pop2p
          in a background deficient in the respective
          heterooligomerization partner ( 
          Δpop2 pop1-13myc , 
          Δpop1 pop2-13myc strains). Pop1p
          and Pop2p complexes were immunopurified with Myc
          antibodies and employed in 
          in vitro ubiquitylation assays upon
          addition of E1, UBC3, ubiquitin, and ATP. High molecular
          weight products generated in the reaction were detected
          by immunoblotting with ubiquitin antibodies. As
          references, we used strains expressing Myc-tagged Pop1p
          or Pop2p in a wild-type background. The experiment
          demonstrated that Pop1p and Pop2p each associate with
          polyubiquitylation activity even in the absence of their
          respective heterooligomerizing F-box proteins (Fig. 7C).
          Thus Pop1p and Pop2p appear to assemble into distinct SCF
          complexes bearing ubiquitin ligase activity 
          in vitro .
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Molecular architecture of SCF Popcomplexes
          The phenomenon of F-box protein oligomerization is not
          unique to SCF Pop. Although the crystal structure of the
          SKP1-SKP2 complex, derived from bacterially expressed
          proteins, revealed a single SKP2 monomer bound to SKP1 [
          28 ] , biochemical studies showed that budding yeast
          Cdc4p, a close homologue of Pop1p\Pop2p, forms
          homooligomers when expressed in insect cells (Correll and
          Deshaies, personal communication). Similarly, β-TRCP1 and
          2, which target IκBα for degradation as homooligomers,
          form heterooligomers that each bind SCF core subunits,
          although no biochemical activity for this
          heterooligomeric complex was demonstrated [ 29 ] .
          Finally, Pop1p and Pop2p homooligomerize, at least when
          overexpressed [ 18 ] , indicating that both F-box
          proteins may also be present as homooligomers in
          individual SCF Pop1pand SCF Pop2p, respectively.
          A surprising finding of this study was that the F-box
          of Pop2p is dispensable for Rum1p degradation and ploidy
          control, while the F-box of Pop1p is essential for both
          functions (Fig. 4Dand 5). The Pop2p F-box is unlikely to
          be a degenerate, non-functional, and hence dispensable,
          motif, as it carries all signature residues of the F-box
          (Fig. 4A). In addition, Pop2p, in the absence of Pop1p,
          assembles into a complex containing all SCF core subunits
          identified here (Fig. 7A). At present, we cannot exclude
          that residues outside the F-box mediate binding of F-box
          deleted Pop2p to Psh1p and other core subunits.
          Consistent with this idea, biochemical studies based on
          the crystal structure of the human SKP1-SKP2 complex
          revealed cooperation of the SKP2 F-box with an adjacent
          region in binding of SKP1 [ 28 ] . Consistent with this
          finding, certain truncation mutants of the budding yeast
          F-box proteins Grr1p and Cdc4p interact poorly with
          Skp1p, despite the retainment of their F-boxes [ 30 31 ]
          . On the other hand, the F-box of Pop1p is essential for
          Rum1p degradation (Fig. 5), arguing that residues outside
          the F-box are insufficient to mediate recruitment of Pop
          proteins into SCF complexes.
          Based on the non-essential function of the Pop2p
          F-box, we propose a molecular architecture of SCF
          Pop1p-Pop2p, in which Pop2p is tethered to the core
          subunits through interaction with Pop1p. Although we have
          no direct biochemical evidence to confirm this
          proposition, which would require Pop2p point mutants
          deficient in Pop1p binding, our data show that severely
          truncated N-terminal fragments of Pop1p and Pop2p lacking
          both F-boxes and WD repeat domains are sufficient to
          mediate their interaction (Fig. 6B). Similarly,
          dimerization of β-TRCP proteins is mediated by N-terminal
          "D-domains" lacking binding of SKP1 and other SCF core
          subunits [ 29 ] . According to our model, the F-box of
          Pop2p would be essential only for the Pop1p-independent
          activities of Pop2p, for which we provide tentative
          evidence by demonstrating the 
          in vivo assembly of SCF
          Pop2pcomplexes (Fig. 7A). These complexes bear ubiquitin
          ligase activity in a substrate-independent 
          in vitro assay (Fig. 7C). To what
          extent this assay reflects the 
          in vivo activity of SCF Pop2pwill
          become testable, once the putative substrates of SCF
          Pop2pare identified.
        
        
          Subcellular compartmentalization of SCF Popas a
          potential mechanism for substrate selection
          Another surprising observation of this study was that
          Pop1p is primarily localized to the nucleus, whereas
          Pop2p is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus
          (Fig. 3). While, nuclear localization was expected, since
          both known substrates of SCF Pop1p-Pop2p, Cdc18p and
          Rum1p, are primarily nuclear proteins, the cytoplasmic
          localization of Pop2p suggests an activity of SCF
          Pop2pdirected toward unknown cytoplasmic substrates. In
          support of this notion, as with human SCF subunits [ 32 ]
          , fission yeast SCF core subunits are also present in the
          cytoplasm, as shown here for overexpressed GFP-fusions
          (Fig. 3A), and for endogenous Pcu1p by immunostaining in
          a previous report [ 24 ] .
          By analogy, additional nuclear substrates of SCF
          Pop1pmay exist. For example, Pop1p is involved in the
          control of the RNA levels of the cyclin Cig2p [ 33 ] .
          While it is unclear whether this effect is mediated at
          the level of transcription or mRNA stability, the budding
          yeast F-box protein Met30p was recently shown to regulate
          the ubiquitylation and activity, but not degradation, of
          the transcription factor Met4p [ 34 ] . In addition, 
          pop1 mutants display an increased
          rate of chromosome loss, a phenotype that is not easily
          explained by accumulation of Rum1p and Cdc18p [ 23 ] .
          Finally, 
          pop1 mutants are sensitive to UV
          irradiation, whereas 
          pop2 mutants are not (D. Griffiths
          and D.A.W., unpublished observation). It is therefore
          likely that other substrates of Pop1p and Pop2p, in
          addition to their common substrates Cdc18p and Rum1p, do
          exist.
          The idea developed above that F-box protein
          compartmentalization contributes to substrate selection
          was recently confirmed directly for Cdc4p-mediated
          degradation of Far1p in budding yeast [ 35 ] . Both,
          Cdc4p and Far1p are nuclear proteins in vegetative cells,
          owing to the presence of nuclear localization signals
          (NLS). Fusion of Cdc4p with a nuclear export signal
          (NES-Cdc4p) prevented its nuclear localization and its
          ability to direct the degradation of nuclear Far1p. When
          Far1p also was targeted to the cytoplasm by disrupting
          its NLS, NES-Cdc4p degraded ΔNLS-Far1p in the cytoplasm [
          35 ] .
          A putative NLS is also present in the N-terminus of
          Pop1p located between the F-box and the WD-repeat domain
          ( 393PEKIKRC). An N-terminal Pop1p fragment containing
          this motif, when fused to the WD-repeat region of Pop2p,
          is targeted exclusively to the nucleus (R.L. &
          D.A.W., unpublished observation). Like wild-type Pop2p,
          the reverse Pop2p-N/Pop1p-C chimera localizes to both the
          nucleus and the cytoplasm, again indicating that Pop1p,
          but not Pop2p, has a functional NLS in its N-terminus
          (R.L. & D.A.W., unpublished observation). It is
          unclear, at present, what regulates Pop2p distribution.
          One possibility is that Pop2p is co-imported in a complex
          with other SCF subunits that is preformed in the
          cytoplasm. Since Pop2p distribution is independent of
          Pop1p (Fig. 3E), SCF core subunits are the most likely
          candidates for such a function. In line with this
          suggestion, it was previously demonstrated that
          HRT1/ROC1/RBX1 promotes nuclear accumulation of CUL1 [ 32
          ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        Our data suggest homo- and heterooligomerization of the
        F-box proteins Pop1p and Pop2p as a mechanism for
        generating combinatorial diversity of SCF function in
        fission yeast. A heterooligomeric SCF Pop1p-Pop2pcomplex
        mediates polyubiquitylation of phosphorylated Rum1p. In
        addition, compartmentalization of homooligomeric SCF
        Pop1pand SCF Pop2pcomplexes may direct the ubiquitylation
        of unknown nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Plasmids and yeast strains
          
          S. pombe genes for 
          psh1 and 
          pip1 were identified in the Sanger
          Centre 
          S. pombe sequence database based on
          their homology to the respective human and budding yeast
          proteins. Complementary DNAs were amplified by PCR,
          subcloned into pREp81.6xHis-Myc, pRep3.6His-Myc, or
          pRep4.HA, and sequenced. Deletion strains and
          epitope-tagged stains were constructed by one-step gene
          replacement using PCR-generated fragments containing
          kanamycin or 
          ura4 cassettes [ 36 ] . Growth
          media, flow cytometry, and all other relevant 
          S. pombe techniques were described
          previously [ 37 ] .
          To generate the 
          pop1::ura4 pop2-13myc-kan strain,
          an 
          h + 
          pop1::ura4 ura4-d18 leul-32
          pRep81.pop1 strain was crossed with a 
          h - 
          leul-32 ura4-d18
          pop2-13myc-kan strain, followed by selection of
          spores on G418/ura -EMM plates. The pRep81. 
          pop1 plasmid required to complement
          the sterility of the 
          pop1 deletion strain was lost by
          growth in non-selective media (YES) for several
          generations. The resulting strain was verified by PCR and
          immunoblotting. The 
          pop2::ura4 pop1-13myc-kan strain
          was generated in an analogous fashion.
        
        
          Antibodies
          Rabbit antisera were raised at Josman LCC (Napa, CA)
          against bacterially expressed MBP-Psh1p, GST-Pcu1p,
          GST-Pip1p, and GST-Pop1p. Sera were affinity purified on
          affinity matrices containing immobilized GST-Psh1p,
          MBP-Pcu1p, MBP-Pip1p, and MBP-Pop1p. Column eluates were
          concentrated to ~1mg/ml and tittered by immunoblotting.
          Rabbit antisera against Pop2p and Rum1p were described
          before [ 20 ] . Monoclonal Myc and HA antibodies were
          purified from 9E10 and 12CA5 tissue culture supernatants
          by binding to protein A.
        
        
          Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
          Protein lysates for immunoblotting were prepared by
          bead lysis in a Fastprep device (Bio 101) in the presence
          of proteinase inhibitors, followed by boiling in SDS
          sample buffer. Cell lysates for small scale
          immunoprecipitations were prepared by disrupting cells in
          immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM Tris/HC1, pH7.4; 150 mM
          NaC1; 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 ug/ml leupeptin, 10 ug/ml
          pepstatin, 17 ug/ml aprotinin, 1 mM PMSF). Lysates were
          cleared and precipitated with the respective antisera.
          Immunocomplexes were collected by binding to protein A or
          G beads, washed and analyzed by immunoblotting as
          described [ 37 ] .
          Large scale lysates for gel filtration and subsequent
          immunoprecipitation were obtained by bead beater lysis.
          Approximately 5 mg of total cell lysates was separated by
          gel filtration on a 16/60 S300 column (Amersham Pharmacia
          Biotech), and 1 ml fractions were immunoprecipitated with
          Pip1p antibodies. Precipitates were fractionated by SDS
          PAGE and assayed by immunoblotting with the respective
          antisera.
        
        
          Indirect immunofluorescence
          Indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed
          exactly as described [ 25 ] .
        
        
          In vitroubiquitylation assay
          For ubiquitylation reactions, Pip1p complexes were
          immunoprecipitated from 100 - 200 ug total cell lysates
          prepared as described above. Precipitates were washed
          four times in 20 mM Tris/HCI, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 0.5%
          Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 5
          μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM PMSF, and equilibrated in 20 mM
          HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM DTT. A
          cocktail was added that contained 8 μM ubiquitin, ATP
          regenerating system (2 mM HEPES at pH 7.4, 1 mM ATP, 30
          mM creatine phosphate, 1 mM magnesium acetate, 0.15 mg/ml
          creatine kinase), reaction buffer (4 mM magnesium
          acetate, 1mM DTT), 500 nM bacterially expressed 6 ×
          His-UBCs, 100 nM 6 × His-tagged human E1, 0.5 μM
          ubiquitin aldehyde in a volume of 15 ul. The reaction was
          started by addition of phosphorylated Rum1p. After 90 min
          at 30°C, the reaction was terminated by the addition 5 ×
          SDS sample buffer. Samples were separated on 11 %
          SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by
          autoradiography.
          Substrate-independent 
          in vitro ubiquitylation activity
          was determined by immunoprecipitating Pop1p-13Myc or
          Pop2p-13Myc with Myc antibodies. The same cocktail as
          described above was added to the precipitates. Reaction
          products were determined by immunoblotting with ubiquitin
          antibodies (Zymed).
        
        
          Subcellular fractionation
          Cells grown in YES were harvested and washed in buffer
          S (1.4 M sorbitol, 40 mM HEPES (pH = 7.2), 0.5 mM MgCl 
          2 ). Cells were resuspended in buffer
          S, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for
          10 min at 30°C. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 4
          pellet volumes of buffer S, 1 mM PMSF, Zymolyase (100
          ug/ml) and incubated at 30°C for 40 min. Cells were
          diluted in buffer S and pelleted by centrifugation and
          resuspended in buffer F (18 % Ficoll 400, w/v; 20 mM
          HEPES (pH = 7.2), 0.5 mM MgCl 
          2 and protease inhibitors. Cells were
          lysed by homogenization using a teflon pestel fitted into
          a microfuge tube. Cell lysis was monitored by microscopy.
          Unlysed cells were pelleted by gentle centrifugation. The
          lysate was placed on top of buffer GF (7% Ficoll 400,
          w/v, 20% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES (pH = 7.2), 0.5 mM MgCl 
          2 ). Nuclei were pelleted by spinning
          at 7000 rpm in a microfuge. The cytoplasmic fraction was
          removed and mixed with SDS sample buffer. The nuclear
          pellet was resolved in an equal volume of SDS sample
          buffer. Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting as
          described in Fig. 3.
