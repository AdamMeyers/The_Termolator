      life education for youth since 1943
      Summer 1996
      Dear Friend:
      Your child was a recent participant in a social Health Program at his
      other school. We hope that you will consider a personal gift to help us
      offer our young people as possible.
      In these volatile times as children and their parents are subjected to
      mounting pressures in the schools, home and workplace and issues of
      personal responsibility are too many times pushed into the background,
      our mission is even more critical. A national emphasis on controlling
      teen pregnancies and taking responsibility for one's actions is already
      emerging as a major issue in the 1996 elections. In short, we all have a
      major stake in promoting responsible behavior among our young people. The
      Social Health Association provides, through its own teachers,
      age-appropriate, abstinence based, in-school programming in three
      different areas: human growth and development; AIDS/STD education; and
      life skills (conflict resolution, peer pressure, decision-making). Our
      programs are provided to schools at a price far below our actual cost. As
      a result, 60% of our budget comes from United Way of Central Indiana, 10%
      from schools, and the remaining 30% from the generosity of business, our
      own fundraising activities and individual gifts. Thus, your gift to
      Social Health is vitally important to our success and can accomplish the
      following:
      *$48 will pay for one hour of programming in human growth and
      development or AIDS/STD education for approximately 50 students.
      *$60 will pay for one program in the life skills component for
      approximately 50 students.
      *$156 will pay for all three programs for one grade level.
      *$240 will pay for human growth and development programming for an
      entire school for approximately 500 students.
      *$500 will pay for all three programs for an entire school for
      approximately 500 students.
      Your support of Social Health Association can help us make a real
      difference in the lives of our children. Thank you for your help.
      Sincerely,
      Nancy K. Haskell Executive Director
