        Cytosolic PLA 
        2 specifically hydrolyzes 
        sn-2 arachidonate from phospholipid
        providing the precursors for many different lipid mediators
        including prostaglandins and leukotrienes [ 1 2 ] . These
        lipid metabolites play a role in acute inflammatory
        responses and also regulate normal physiological processes.
        Certain prostaglandins are required for female reproduction
        and kidney function [ 3 4 5 ] . Because of its important
        role in controlling levels of arachidonic acid (AA), much
        attention has been focused on the regulation of cPLA 
        2 activation, with particular emphasis
        on the role of its phosphorylation and Ca 2+-mediated
        translocation [ 6 7 8 ] .
        cPLA 
        2 is regulated by controlling its
        cellular localization and access to membrane-phospholipid
        substrate. An amino terminal, calcium-dependent lipid
        binding (CaLB or C2) domain regulates Ca 2+-mediated cPLA 
        2 translocation to intracellular
        membranes [ 9 ] . In vitro, membrane docking via the C2
        domain is necessary and sufficient for catalysis and
        release of AA [ 10 ] . Binding of calcium ions by the cPLA 
        2 C2 domain is essential for the lipid
        association in vitro [ 11 12 ] and translocation in vivo [
        13 14 ] . In response to an increase in [Ca 2+] 
        i , cPLA 
        2 translocates to the Golgi and ER,
        however translocation to Golgi occurs at a lower [Ca 2+] 
        i [ 15 ] .
        Protein kinase pathways play major roles in cPLA 
        2 activation, and regulation by the
        mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)
        /extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) signaling
        pathway has received particular attention. cPLA 
        2 is phosphorylated by mitogen activated
        protein (MAP) kinases, including p42/p44 ERKs and p38, on
        Ser 505in vitro [ 16 17 ] and in response to receptor
        stimulation [ 16 18 19 20 21 ] . In addition to
        phosphorylation by MAP kinase, it has been shown that cPLA 
        2 is also phosphorylated on Ser 727by
        MAPK-interacting kinase I (MNKI) [ 22 ] and on Ser 515by
        calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II [ 23 ] .
        Phosphorylation of these sites may also play a role in
        regulating cPLA 
        2 function in certain cell models.
        Phosphorylation of Ser 505has been extensively studied
        because it is readily detected due to a characteristic
        electrophoretic mobility shift when analyzed by SDS-PAGE [
        13 16 ] . The importance of Ser 505phosphorylation in
        regulating cPLA 
        2 has been demonstrated in different
        cells and in vitro models by using cPLA 
        2 containing a S505A mutation [ 16 22 ]
        . However, the mechanism whereby Ser 505phosphorylation
        regulates cPLA 
        2 function has been elusive. In vitro
        studies have demonstrated that dephosphorylated cPLA 
        2 is catalytically active and that Ser
        505phosphorylation increases activity by only ~30 percent [
        24 ] . In contrast, cells expressing the cPLA 
        2 S505A mutation fail to release AA in
        response to a low dose of calcium ionophore, but release
        similar amounts of AA as cells expressing wild-type cPLA 
        2 in response to high dose ionophore [
        22 ] . From these studies, it has been suggested that cPLA 
        2 Ser 505phosphorylation may have a role
        in regulating translocation [ 22 ] . A previous study
        demonstrated translocation of cPLA 
        2 S505A in response to Ca 2+ionophore,
        but did not address the kinetics of translocation,
        translocation in response to a physiological agonist, or
        differences in targeting [ 25 ] .
        To better understand the regulation of cPLA 
        2 by the MEK1/ERK pathway and Ca 2+, we
        investigated the effect of MEK inhibitors on AA release,
        cPLA 
        2 phosphorylation of Ser 505, cPLA 
        2 translocation kinetics, and [Ca 2+] 
        i increase in Madin-Darby canine kidney
        (MDCK) cells. We found that inhibition of MEK1 by U0126
        significantly inhibited AA release and this was correlated
        with inhibition of ERK activation. However, MEK inhibition
        only partially affected cPLA 
        2 phosphorylation and had no effect on
        the kinetics of Ca 2+-mediated cPLA 
        2 translocation to membrane. In
        addition, using cells expressing wild-type cPLA 
        2 and cPLA 
        2 with S505A or S727A mutations, it was
        found that translocation kinetics and membrane targeting in
        response to ATP or ionomycin was similar to wild-type cPLA 
        2 . These data suggest that MEK1
        inhibition reduces cPLA 
        2 catalytic activity and AA release
        independently of phosphorylation and translocation.
      
      
        Results
        
          Effect of MEK inhibition on AA release, ERK
          activation, and cPLA 2Ser 505phosphorylation
          To study the role of the MEK1/ERK pathway in cPLA 
          2 activation, quiesced MDCK cells were
          treated with the MEK1 inhibitor U0126, and the effect on
          AA release, ERK activation, and cPLA 
          2 gel shift determined (Fig. 1). For
          equivalence with the imaging studies, cells expressing
          EGFP-cPLA 
          2 were used in all experiments.
          EGFP-cPLA 
          2 was expressed to similar levels as
          endogenous enzyme but did not contribute significantly to
          AA release in stably transfected cells. However,
          EGFP-cPLA 
          2 is functional since it
          dose-dependently catalyzes release of AA when expressed
          in cells that lack endogenous cPLA 
          2 , such as Sf9 cells [ 13 ] and
          immortalized mouse lung fibroblasts from cPLA 
          2 α knock-out mice [ 26 ] . In order
          to enhance AA release in cells containing endogenous cPLA
          
          2 , it is necessary to over-express
          the enzyme several fold as previously reported [ 16 ] .
          Cytosolic PLA 
          2 has been shown to mediate Ca
          2+-induced AA release in MDCK cells treated with ATP and
          IONO in experiments using the group IV cPLA 
          2 α-specific inhibitor pyrrolidine-1 [
          27 ] . To measure cPLA 
          2 mediated AA release, EGFP-cPLA 
          2 -transfected MDCK cells labeled with
          [ 3H]-AA were incubated with 0.3, 1 or 10 μM U0126 for 15
          min prior to stimulation with 100 μM ATP, 1 μM IONO, or
          10 μM IONO. AA release was measured at 3 min because we
          have shown that ATP- and IONO-stimulated AA release peaks
          between 3 to 5 min post-stimulation [ 15 ] .
          Agonist-induced AA release was inhibited dose-dependently
          by U0126 (Fig. 1A) with the highest U0126 concentration
          used (10 μM) reducing AA release by 72-80% with all
          agonists (Table I). This inhibition was independent of
          the total amount of AA released, since AA release
          stimulated by 10 μM IONO was 3-fold greater than release
          stimulated with 1 μM IONO or 100 μM ATP, but the percent
          inhibition by U0126 was similar. Treatment of MDCK cells
          with 30 μM PD098059, a less potent inhibitor of MEK [ 28
          29 ] , resulted in a ~50% reduction in AA release in
          response to 100 μM ATP, 1 μM IONO, and 10 μM IONO (data
          not shown). Thus, in MDCK cells, MEK1 inhibition
          significantly reduces the ability of cPLA 
          2 to hydrolyze AA from membrane
          phospholipids.
          The effect of MEK1 inhibition on activation of p42/p44
          ERK measured by immunoblot analysis using
          phospho-specific antibodies in cells treated with U0126
          and stimulated as above was determined (Fig. 1B). Work in
          our laboratory has shown that recognition of ERK by
          anti-phospho-ERK antibodies correlates with an increase
          in ERK activity [ 21 30 31 ] . Interestingly, the
          anti-phospho-ERK immunoblots revealed that ERKs were
          constitutively activated in untreated, quiesced MDCK
          cells and activation was not enhanced further by ATP or
          IONO (Fig. 1B, left panel). ERK activation was diminished
          by increasing concentrations of U0126 and was
          quantitatively inhibited after 15 min incubation in 10 μM
          U0126. U0126 decreased ERK activation following ATP or
          IONO stimulation in the same fashion as in unstimulated
          cells. Consequently, there was a direct correlation
          between the reduction of AA release (Fig. 1A) and
          inhibition of ERK activation (Fig. 1B) in MDCK cells
          treated with U0126.
          Because cPLA 
          2 is a target of the MEK1/ERK
          signaling cascade, we assayed the effect of MEK1
          inhibition by U0126 on cPLA 
          2 phosphorylation by analyzing gel
          shift of cPLA 
          2 . Phosphorylation of Ser 505results
          in a retardation of its electrophoretic mobility (gel
          shift) [ 13 16 ] . In unstimulated cells, EGFP-tagged and
          endogenous cPLA 
          2 were nearly completely gel shifted,
          indicating that most cPLA 
          2 was phosphorylated on Ser 505(Fig.
          1C), which is consistent with the observation that ERKs
          are constitutively activated. Incubation with U0126
          resulted in a partial reversal of the gel shift although,
          at 10 μM U0126, approximately half of cPLA 
          2 remained phosphorylated on Ser 505.
          Thus, unlike the quantitative effect of U0126 on ERK
          activation, inhibition of MEK1 with U0126 only partially
          reversed the gel shift of cPLA 
          2 . The reversal of the gel shift was
          similar in cells treated with ATP and 1 and 10 μM IONO.
          Due to the increased molecular weight of the EGFP-tagged
          cPLA 
          2 , the two forms of cPLA 
          2 did not separate as well, making the
          gel shift more difficult to visualize, but generally
          mirrored the gel shift characteristics of the endogenous
          cPLA 
          2 . These results suggest that, in
          response to MEK1 inhibition, there is a quantitative,
          dose-dependent decrease in AA release that correlates
          well with the loss of ERK activation, but not with the
          extent of cPLA 
          2 Ser 505phosphorylation.
          To further investigate whether the MEK1/ERK pathway
          played a role in regulating AA release independent of Ser
          505phosphorylation, we treated cells with anisomycin,
          which activates the MAPK homolog p38, but not the
          MEK1/ERK pathway [ 32 ] . Activation of p38 in response
          to anisomycin treatment was analyzed by immunoblotting
          using an anti-phospho-p38 antibody (Fig. 2A). The
          immunoblots demonstrate that 30 min treatment in 25 ng/ml
          anisomycin resulted in phosphorylation of p38 in
          unstimulated MDCK cells and in cells treated with ATP or
          IONO. ATP and ionomycin treatment in the absence of
          anisomycin only weakly increased p38 phosphorylation. As
          expected, the MEK inhibitor U0126 did not significantly
          affect anisomycin-stimulated p38 phosphorylation. In
          control experiments, anisomycin treatment did not induce
          ERK activation nor interfere with inhibition of ERK
          activation by 10 μM U0126 treatment (Fig. 2B). We have
          previously reported that p38 is also selectively
          activated in anisomycin-treated macrophages [ 21 ] .
          Importantly, pretreatment of cells for 30 min with
          anisomycin resulted in maintenance of the cPLA 
          2 gel shift in the presence of U0126
          in unstimulated cells and in cells stimulated with ATP
          and 1 and 10 μM IONO (Fig. 2C). AA release assays show
          that, in MDCK cells treated with anisomycin, U0126
          resulted in an AA release reduction of ~67-76% (Fig. 2D)
          similar to the inhibition observed without anisomycin.
          These results demonstrate that activation of the MEK1/ERK
          pathway is required for AA release even under conditions
          where cPLA 
          2 Ser 505phosphorylation is
          maintained, suggesting an alternative role for the
          MEK1/ERK pathway in regulating cPLA 
          2 .
        
        
          [Ca 2+] iincrease is independent of MEK1/ERK
          pathway
          One explanation for the decrease in AA is that U0126
          inhibits [Ca 2+] 
          i mobilization in response to ATP or
          IONO, thereby preventing translocation of cPLA 
          2 . In chick ventricular myocytes,
          inhibition of MEK1/ERK by PD98059 inhibits
          zinterol-mediated AA release, but also inhibits
          zinterol-induced stimulation of [Ca 2+] 
          i cycling in electrically stimulated
          cells [ 33 ] . In MDCK cells, extracellular ATP acts via
          P 
          2Y2 receptors to elicit an IP 
          3 -mediated [Ca 2+] 
          i increase [ 34 ] and IONO acts to
          increase [Ca 2+] 
          i by permeabilizing cell membranes to
          Ca 2+. To determine the effect of U0126 on intracellular
          Ca 2+mobilization by 100 μM ATP or 10 μM IONO, we
          utilized single-cell fluorescence microscopy on cells
          loaded with the calcium indicator Fura2. Analysis of the
          [Ca 2+] 
          i increase in individual cells reveals
          the heterogeneity in the response to ATP, although most
          cells exhibited [Ca 2+] 
          i spikes of similar magnitude and
          duration (Fig. 3Aand 3B, thin lines). Analysis of the [Ca
          2+] 
          i increase in several cells (Fig.
          3Aand 3B, thick line) revealed that although the duration
          of the [Ca 2+] 
          i increase elicited by ATP in control
          cells was the same as in the U0126-treated cells,
          approximately 3-4 min, the amplitude of the [Ca 2+] 
          i increase was slightly higher (~20%)
          in the U0126-treated cells. IONO elicited a sustained,
          supraphysiological [Ca 2+] 
          i increase in cells that was also
          slightly enhanced by U0126 (Fig. 3Cand 3D). These
          experiments demonstrate that U0126 does not decrease [Ca
          2+] 
          i mobilization, and the inhibition of
          AA release by U0126 cannot be ascribed to a failure in
          [Ca 2+] 
          i mobilization.
        
        
          cPLA 2translocation is independent of MEK1/ERK
          pathway
          The effect of inhibition of the MEK1/ERK pathway by
          U0126 on translocation of cPLA 
          2 was investigated. Although there is
          no inhibition of [Ca 2+] 
          i release by U0126 and little effect
          on Ser 505phosphorylation, it is possible that MEK1
          inhibition by U0126 prevents cPLA 
          2 translocation by another mechanism.
          To investigate this possibility, cells were transfected
          with a wild-type cPLA 
          2 fused to EYFP (EYFP-cPLA 
          2 ) and the distribution of EYFP-cPLA 
          2 was imaged in response to [Ca 2+] 
          i transients elicited by ATP and
          sustained [Ca 2+] 
          i elevations elicited by IONO, in the
          presence and absence of U0126. Following stimulation with
          100 μM ATP, there was a rapid translocation of EYFP-cPLA 
          2 to Golgi that was unaffected by
          U0126 (Fig. 4A,4B). In response to physiological agonists
          that elicit transient [Ca 2+] 
          i changes, only a small fraction of
          the cPLA 
          2 translocates. This observation is
          consistent with our previous results [ 15 ] and has been
          demonstrated by Hirabayashi et al. [ 35 ] . Most studies
          of cPLA 
          2 translocation have utilized
          ionophore, which elicits a large, supraphysiological
          sustained increase in [Ca 2+] 
          i [ 14 15 25 35 36 37 38 ] , or
          agonists that produce a sustained [Ca 2+] 
          i increase [ 35 ] . Under these
          conditions, a large proportion of cPLA 
          2 binds to membrane. These studies
          show extensive translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum
          (ER), nuclear envelope and Golgi [ 14 15 35 36 38 ] . We
          found that U0126 also failed to alter extensive EYFP-cPLA
          
          2 translocation to Golgi and ER in
          response 10 μM IONO (Fig. 4C,4D). These results
          demonstrate that MEK inhibition has no effect on cPLA 
          2 translocation.
        
        
          Translocation of phosphorylation site mutants S505A
          or S727A is similar as wild-type cPLA 2
          Phosphorylation of cPLA 
          2 on Ser 505has been hypothesized to
          play a role in Ca 2+-mediated translocation since Ser
          505phosphorylation is required for cPLA 
          2 -mediated AA release in response to
          low-dose, but not high-dose, ionophore [ 22 ] .
          Translocation of cPLA 
          2 S505A in CHO cells has been reported
          in response to ionophore stimulation [ 25 ] , but the
          effect of Ser 505phosphorylation on the kinetics of
          translocation, targeting, and in response to a
          physiological agonist was not investigated. MDCK cells
          were co-transfected with EYFP-cPLA 
          2 and a cPLA 
          2 with a S505A mutation fused to ECFP
          (ECFP-cPLA 
          2 S505A). Using dual EYFP/ECFP
          imaging, we were able to directly compare translocation
          of both constructs in the same cell. The resting
          distribution of EYFP-cPLA 
          2 was similar to that of ECFP-cPLA 
          2 S505A and, in response to ATP
          followed by IONO, the pattern of translocation of
          EYFP-cPLA 
          2 was similar to ECFP-cPLA 
          2 S505A (Fig. 5panels A and B, D).
          Analysis of the increase in fluorescence at the Golgi
          with respect to time demonstrates that the rates of
          translocation of cPLA 
          2 and cPLA 
          2 S505A elicited by ATP followed by
          IONO are very similar (Fig. 5C). As previously reported [
          22 ] , the cPLA 
          2 S727A mutation has a similar
          phenotype on AA release as the S505A mutation and Ser
          727was found to be phosphorylated in tandem with Ser 505.
          Imaging experiments were performed using EYFP-cPLA 
          2 and ECFP-cPLA 
          2 S727A and we found that the
          distribution of EYFP-cPLA 
          2 was identical to that of ECFP-cPLA 
          2 S727A before and after stimulation
          with 10 μM IONO (Fig. 7 panels A and B, D). Analysis of
          the increase in fluorescence at the Golgi with respect to
          time demonstrates that the rates of translocation of cPLA
          
          2 and the cPLA 
          2 S727A elicited by IONO are very
          similar (Fig. 6C).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The MEK1/ERK pathway regulates cPLA 
        2 and ERKs phosphorylate cPLA 
        2 on Ser 505. The results of this study
        demonstrate that this pathway is required for cPLA 
        2 -mediated AA release independent of
        Ser 505phosphorylation and extend our previous work in
        macrophages [ 13 ] by demonstrating that this alternative
        role of the MEK1/ERK pathway is not involved in regulating
        [Ca 2+] 
        i change or cPLA 
        2 translocation kinetics or targeting,
        but is required for optimal hydrolytic activity and AA
        release.
        The results shown here demonstrate that inhibition of
        MEK with U0126 quantitatively inhibits both ERK
        phosphorylation and AA release in MDCK cells in response to
        [Ca 2+] 
        i mobilization. The MEK inhibitor
        PD098059, a less potent inhibitor [ 28 29 ] , also
        inhibited ATP- and IONO-induced AA release (data not
        shown). ERK was found to be constitutively phosphorylated
        in our study using MDCK cells from ATCC, in contrast to
        what has been reported previously for MDCK-D 
        1 , a subclone of MDCK selected for
        adrenergic receptor expression [ 39 40 ] . However, a
        side-by-side comparison of MDCK cells from ATCC and the
        MDCK-D 
        1 subclone (kindly provided by Dr. Paul
        Insel, UCSD) demonstrated constitutive activation of ERKs
        when both are grown at low density (not shown). However, at
        high density ERKs are less active and can be further
        activated by phorbol ester (not shown).
        In MDCK-D 

        1 cells, without constitutively active
        ERKs, AA release is delayed after [Ca 2+] 
        i mobilization, and is temporally
        correlated with ERK activation [ 40 ] , whereas in MDCK
        cells with constitutively active ERKs, AA release is rapid,
        with significant AA release measured 30 s after [Ca 2+] 
        i increase [ 15 ] . This temporal
        correlation between AA release and ERK activation has also
        been reported in CHO cells in response to PAF stimulation [
        35 41 ] . These results support the observations made here
        that ERK activity is required for phospholipid hydrolysis
        independently of cPLA 
        2 translocation.
        cPLA 
        2 -mediated AA release must be preceded
        by translocation of the enzyme to its membrane substrate
        which is a Ca 2+-dependent process and is a function of the
        calcium-dependent lipid-binding (C2) domain. cPLA 
        2 translocates primarily to Golgi in
        response to a transient [Ca 2+] 
        i changes and to Golgi and ER in
        response to a sustained [Ca 2+] 
        i increase [ 15 ] . The reduction in AA
        release by MEK inhibition did not involve a failure in [Ca
        2+] 
        i release or translocation. These
        results show that translocation is necessary but not
        sufficient for optimum hydrolytic activity.
        Measuring cPLA 
        2 translocation is not a trivial matter
        when investigating mechanisms of AA release. For example,
        cPLA 
        2 constructs with a S505A mutation have
        long been recognized as unable to support AA release in
        response to physiological agonists or low-dose ionophore
        when transfected in cells. In contrast, cPLA 
        2 S505A is active in vitro and
        phosphorylation only modestly increases the activity of the
        enzyme [ 16 17 24 ] . Interestingly, the inhibitory effect
        of the S505A mutation on AA release is obviated by a high
        [Ca 2+] 
        i increase. In light of these
        observations, it is possible that Ser 505phosphorylation
        may alter the [Ca 2+] 
        i sensitivity of the enzyme, its rate of
        translocation, its intracellular targeting or, as has been
        previously suggested [ 22 ] , the ability of cPLA 
        2 to release from a non-membrane
        sequestering agent. Although one report has shown that cPLA
        
        2 S505A translocates in CHO cells in
        response to ionophore, we were able to directly compare
        rates of translocation between cPLA 
        2 and cPLA 
        2 S505A to a physiological agonist and
        found no difference between translocation rates or
        intracellular targeting. We also demonstrated that there
        was no difference in translocation rates or intracellular
        targeting between wild-type cPLA 
        2 and cPLA 
        2 S727A, which has the same phenotype as
        S505A with regard to AA release when transfected into
        cells. Thus, the role of cPLA 
        2 phosphorylation in mediating AA
        release remains unclear.
        Although the alternative mechanism whereby the MEK1/ERK
        pathway regulates cPLA 
        2 is not known, it is possible that it
        affects membrane properties and/or cPLA 
        2 conformation that promotes optimal
        hydrolytic activity. It is also possible that the
        alternative mechanism is due to phosphorylation of cPLA 
        2 on a novel site by a kinase that is
        downstream of the MEK1/ERK pathway or phosphorylation of a
        regulatory protein.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Translocation to membrane is a critical regulatory step
        for the action of cPLA 
        2 because it is necessary for access to
        substrate. In this study we demonstrate, however, that
        association of cPLA 
        2 with membrane when phosphorylated on
        Ser 505is not sufficient for its full activity in vivo.
        This is demonstrated by the results showing that inhibition
        of the MEK1/ERK pathway significantly blocks AA release but
        has no effect on [Ca 2+] 
        i mobilization or cPLA 
        2 translocation and targeting.
        Diminution of AA release by MEK1/ERK is also independent of
        cPLA 
        2 phosphorylation on Ser 505.
        Consequently, our results demonstrate in living cells that
        the translocation process and subsequent catalytic activity
        on the membrane are two independently regulated steps.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Fluorescent protein-cPLA 2fusion constructs
          DNA encoding the full-length human cPLA 
          2 was cloned into the vector pEGFP-C3
          (Clontech) to create pEGFP-cPLA 
          2 , as previously described [ 15 ] .
          The XbaI/PstI fragment from a cPLA 
          2 α clone containing S505A or S727A
          mutations [ 13 ] was inserted into an XbaI/PstI site in
          pEGFP-cPLA 
          2 to generate pEGFP-cPLA 
          2 S505A and pECFP-cPLA 
          2 S727A. Different fluorescent-protein
          tagged constructs were produced by exchanging the
          NheI/BsrGI fragment containing the fluorescent protein
          coding sequence between EGFP, EYFP, and ECFP. All
          constructs were confirmed by sequencing.
        
        
          Cell culture
          MDCK cells obtained from ATCC were cultured in DMEM
          containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml
          streptomycin, 0.292 mg/ml glutamine (growth medium) in 5%
          CO 
          2 at 37°C. Subconfluent cells (5 × 10
          3cells/cm 2) were transfected with 2 μg of the relevant
          plasmid using Fugene-6 (Boehringer Mannheim) in DMEM
          containing 0.2% BSA, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml
          streptomycin, 0.292 mg/ml glutamine (serum-free medium)
          following the manufacturer's protocol. Stable lines
          expressing EGFP-cPLA 
          2 were generated by growing
          transfected cells in growth medium for 3 d, supplementing
          the growth medium with 5 mg/ml Geneticin (antibiotic
          G418-sulfate), and culturing for an additional 2 wk in
          Geneticin. Cells expressing EGFP fluorescence were
          selected using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The
          EGFP-positive cells were maintained in growth medium
          supplemented with 5 mg/ml Geneticin. For imaging studies,
          MDCK cells were plated on glass-bottomed 35 mm culture
          dishes (MatTek) at 5 × 10 3cells/cm 2in growth medium and
          incubated overnight, transfected with the relevant
          plasmid(s), changed into serum-free medium to quiesce the
          cells, incubated overnight, and used the next day.
        
        
          Immunoblotting
          Stable EGFP-cPLA 
          2 transfectants were grown on 100 mm
          dishes at 5 × 10 3cells/cm 2in growth medium for one day,
          then quiesced in serum-free medium overnight. Cells were
          scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,
          150 mM sodium chloride, 1.5 mM magnesium chloride, 10%
          glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EGTA, 200 μM sodium
          vanadate, 10 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 100 mM sodium
          fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin.
          Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × 
          g for 15 min, and protein
          concentration of the supernatant was determined by the
          bicinchoninic acid method. Laemmli electrophoresis sample
          buffer (5×) was added to the lysates, and
          SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting
          were performed using 35 μg lysate protein,
          phospho-specific antibodies for ERK and p38, and rabbit
          polyclonal antibody for cPLA 
          2 [ 21 ] .
        
        
          Dual imaging microscopy of fluorescent protein
          translocation
          In order to compare the characteristics of full-length
          cPLA 
          2 and cPLA 
          2 S505A or cPLA 
          2 S727A translocation, while
          controlling for cell-to-cell heterogeneity, we used a
          dual CFP/YFP imaging approach. EYFP-cPLA 
          2 /ECFP-cPLA 
          2 S505A- or pECFP-cPLA 
          2 S727A-transfected MDCK cells grown
          on MatTek plates were quiesced overnight in serum-free
          medium, washed with and incubated in Hank's balanced salt
          solution (HBSS) additionally buffered with 25 mM HEPES pH
          7.4 (HHBSS). Cells were imaged using an Olympus inverted
          microscope equipped with a 60×, 1.25 NA oil immersion
          objective, CFP and YFP emission filters (Chroma) in a
          Sutter filter wheel, a dual CFP/YFP dichroic mirror, and
          a TILL Imago CCD camera (TILL Photonics). Excitation
          light of 430 and 510 nm for CFP and YFP, respectively,
          was provided using a Polychrome IV monochromator (TILL
          Photonics). TILLvisION software was used for acquisition
          and analysis. Bleach values for ECFP and EYFP were
          calculated by determining the background-corrected
          fluorescence for the entire cell with respect to time and
          normalizing each value to the initial value. ECFP/EYFP
          fluorescence changes with respect to time for regions of
          interest corresponding to an area of Golgi membrane were
          determined by calculating the F 
          t /F 
          0 , where F 
          t is the background- and
          bleach-corrected ECFP or EYFP fluorescence at time = t
          and F 
          0 is the background-corrected ECFP or
          EYFP fluorescence at time = 0 s. Fluorescence was
          normalized to the F 
          0 value, which resulted in F 
          t /F 
          0 representing the fraction of total
          cell fluorescence at Golgi. Final images were produced
          using Adobe Photoshop.
        
        
          Calcium imaging
          MDCK cells grown on MatTek plates were quiesced
          overnight in serum-free medium, washed with HHBSS
          containing 1 mM probenecid and incubated with 5 μM
          Fura2-AM (Calbiochem) in HHBSS, 1 mM probenecid, and 1%
          DMSO for 45 min at 37°C. Cells were then washed with
          HHBSS containing 1 mM probenecid and imaged after a 30
          min incubation for de-esterification of the Fura2-AM.
          Single-cell imaging was performed on the Olympus system
          described above, but using a 40×, 1.35 NA oil immersion
          objective and a Fura2 dichroic mirror and emission filter
          (Chroma). Fura2 image pairs illuminated at 340 and 380 nm
          were taken at 1 Hz. The [Ca 2+] 
          i increase is expressed as the ratio
          of the background-corrected Fura2 fluorescence at 340 and
          380 nm [ 42 ] .
        
        
          Measurement of AA release
          The protocol for determining AA release is essentially
          as described [ 15 21 ] . MDCK cells stably expressing
          EGFP-cPLA 
          2 were plated in 12-well plates at 5 ×
          10 3cells/cm 2and incubated in growth medium overnight.
          Cells were then washed twice with serum-free medium and
          incubated with 0.25 μCi [ 3H]-AA/well in serum-free
          medium overnight. U0126 or vehicle was added to each well
          and the cells were then incubated for 15 min at 37°C in
          5% CO 
          2 . Cells were washed to remove
          unincorporated [ 3H]-AA and then incubated in HHBSS
          supplemented with 0.05% BSA with either U0126 or vehicle.
          Cells were stimulated with the agonist of choice and the
          medium was collected at appropriate time points. The
          medium was centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min, and the amount
          of radioactivity in the supernatant was determined by
          scintillation counting. Cells were scraped in 0.5 ml 0.1%
          Triton X-100 for determining the total cellular
          radioactivity.
