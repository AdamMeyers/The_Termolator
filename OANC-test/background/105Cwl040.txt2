      Dear:
      Now more than ever girls need your support to help their dreams become
      a reality.
      Each generation of girls faces new challenges: new technology, new
      moral issues, new opportunities. Girl Scouts experience a wide range of
      real life skills--first aid, resume writing, and managing money. They
      also reap benefits that are difficult to measure, including enhanced
      self-esteem, greater confidence in their abilities, and the strength and
      conviction to take the lead and excel in their endeavors.
      We start early. As a preventive, informal education program, Girl
      Scouting helps girls relate to others, develop values, contribute to
      their society, and develop their own potential. Resulting in reduced risk
      of teen pregnancy, suicide, truancy, substance abuse and so many other
      crises.
      A gift to the 1997 Girl Scout Annual Campaign helps to ensure that
      girls will continue to receive the benefits that Girl Scouting offers.
      Today's girls will be tomorrow's leaders--and they're counting on
      YOU!
      Sincerely,
      Sheron Seward President
