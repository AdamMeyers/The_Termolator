      Dear Name,
      Young women are growing up in an ever-changing society. As a
      contributor to the Council in past appeals I know that you are aware of
      our mission---to prepare girls with ethical values, character, a desire
      to succeed and a commitment to their community.
      This letter is our 1997 request to 3~ for a gift to the Annual
      Campaign for support of our operating budget.
      This year's Annual Campaign goal is $65,000. We invite you to consider
      a contribution.
      Your gift, along with the many others we receive, will provide vital
      resources for today's Girl Scouts to become tomorrow's community and
      business leaders. Your investment in Girl Scouting is one that will pay
      dividends for years to come, not only in your community, but in your
      workforce. A recent Lou Harris poll indicates that over 66% of today's
      female business leaders have Girl Scout backgrounds.
      Take a step toward making a difference in the lives of our young woman
      and recommit to the Girl Scout vision. Your investment in the Annual
      Campaign is sure to yield high returns.
      Sincerely,
      Sheron Seward President
