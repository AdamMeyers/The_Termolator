      Dear ,
      Look at the benefits girls participating in Girl Scouts receive. Girl
      Scouts of the U.S.A. commissioned SPEC Associates (Social Program
      Evaluators and Consultants, Inc) to conduct a National Outcomes Study of
      the Girl Scout program The results were overwhelmingly positive. Its
      findings include:
      Girl Scouting helps girls build nine personal assets which research
      has shown to be essential for children's healthy development and well
      being. The nine assets are known to enhance school success, educational
      aspirations, and the development of positive behaviors.
      Girl Scouting unites girls, families, and communities. When asked to
      compare opportunities received in their Girl Scout activities versus
      those in their schools, Girl Scouts at all age levels responded that
      troop activities offered them significantly more chances to achieve
      positive, pro-social outcomes. Girls cited feelings of belonging,
      helpfulness, teamwork, and leadership, while gaining respect for others
      and values and decision making skills. Older girls found that Girl
      Scouting provided even more positive outcomes during the crucial
      adolescent years.
      Girl Scouting benefits parent/child relationships. Parents reported
      significant benefits from Girl Scouting for their daughters and
      themselves. The benefits included sharing more quality time and improved
      relationships with their daughters. Parents also gained friendships with
      other adults and a feeling of giving back to the community.
      Girl Scouting benefits volunteers by developing their leadership
      skills and self-confidence. The study concludes, "In 1912, Juliette
      Gordon Low had a vision. Today that vision is connecting girls, parents,
      and volunteers for opportunities to tap their skiffs, to succeed in their
      lives, an to enrich their relationships with their friends, families, and
      communities."
      Girls are important to us. They have the potential to shape our world
      and make important decisions that will affect us all. Yet they face many
      challenges in their lives. Through outdoor activities, learning projects,
      and community service, Girl Scouting provides girls with the tools to
      face those challenges and make sound decisions. Please join me in making
      a generous contribution to this year's Annual Campaign. Invest in the
      future of girls - the future of us all.
      Sincerely,
      Starla A. Tigg Development Committee Chair
