      who have never learned to read.
      Here's how YOU can make an important difference in someone's
      life...
      Dear Friends of Literacy,
      We all share a special interest in reading. For some people, learning
      to read has been a lifelong dream. You can help people reach their dreams
      of reading and learning by making a contribution to Indy Reads. Although
      I'm a retired person, today I have a beautiful outlook on life because of
      Indy Reads. When I was working, I couldn't read well enough to accept a
      foreman job, so I turned it down. Now at the age of 67, after six years
      in this organization with wonderful teachers and other leaders, I
      graduated from Indy Reads and I'm studying for my GED. Make your donation
      today so Indy Reads can continue teaching people to read and help them
      achieve their dreams.
      Sincerely yours,
      James T. Moore
      P.S. Your donation will help us all!
