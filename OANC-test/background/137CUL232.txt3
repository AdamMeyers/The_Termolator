      Dear ,
      I am writing to thank you for contacting Prevent Child Abuse New York
      and to invite you to continue sharing our mission by becoming a
      member.
      Last year, more than 48,000 New York State children were abused and
      neglected -injured, molested, emotionally abused, denied adequate care
      and supervision. Each week, about 3 children in this state die from child
      abuse or neglect. Most are babies and toddlers, and their parents are
      overwhelmed. You can help.
      Join Prevent Child Abuse New York in protecting children. We are the
      only statewide not-for-profit organization whose primary mission is child
      abuse prevention. As a member , your voice will be added to those of
      others across the state, with the message that we can and must create
      caring communities that support families and shelter children.
      You can help us help overburdened new parents. Healthy Families New
      York is an effective voluntary home visiting program We train staff at
      sites across the state, and assist communities to develop the service for
      their families.
      We provide help by phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through the
      Prevention Information Resource Center & Parent Help line. We promote
      compassionate, effective policies to protect children and prevent their
      maltreatment through our Legislative Advocacy. We educate through Child
      Abuse Prevention Month and other public awareness and media
      campaigns.
      All of this is possible because we are a statewide member network.
