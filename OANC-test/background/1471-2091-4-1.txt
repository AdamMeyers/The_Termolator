        Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are negatively charged
        polysaccharides derived from an amino hexose. They are
        structural and functional modulators of extracellular
        matrices that play important roles in CNS development and
        repair. They exhibit both stimulatory and inhibitory
        influences on neurite outgrowth and survival. Evidence
        demonstrates the ability of heparin sulfates (HSs) to bind
        to growth/trophic factors and selectively regulate such
        factors' receptors. [ 1 2 ] . They can act as co-receptors
        of growth/trophic and survival factors to regulate cell
        behavior and/or restrict diffusion and create a relatively
        high local concentration of ligand.
        Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is an
        extracellular neuronal differentiation and survival factor
        for cells derived from the retina and CNS. It induces
        neuronal differentiation in retinoblastoma cells, protects
        retina neurons (including photoreceptors) from death by
        apoptosis and other insults, and has a morphogenetic effect
        on photoreceptor cells [ 3 4 5 6 ] . It also has
        neurotrophic effects on neurons from the cerebellum,
        hippocampus and spinal cord [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 ] . In the
        intact retina, this factor is identified as a secreted
        protein associated by ionic interactions with the
        interphotoreceptor matrix [ 13 14 ] , where GAGs are the
        major polyanionic components.
        Biochemically, PEDF is a 50-kDa glycoprotein with
        structural homology to members of the serine-protease
        inhibitor (serpin) superfamily [ 3 15 ] . However, it has
        no inhibitory effects on proteases. Its neurotrophic
        activities are independent of its protease inhibition
        potential but dependent on its interaction with
        cell-surface receptors [ 9 12 16 17 18 ] . PEDF has high
        binding affinity for cell-surface receptors in human
        retinoblastoma Y-79 cells (K 
        
          d 
         = 2.7 nM), which is mediated by interactions between a
        region spanning amino acid positions 78-121 of the PEDF
        polypeptide and the extracellular domains of the receptor
        protein [ 18 ] . Blockage of these interactions inhibits
        the PEDF neurotrophic effects. PEDF also has binding
        affinity for GAGs, such as, heparin, heparin- and
        chondroitin-sulfates, but this affinity is ~1000-fold lower
        than for the receptor (e.g., K 
        
          d 
         4 μM for the heparin-PEDF interactions) [ 14 19 ] .
        The binding to GAGs is mediated by ionic interactions
        between an area clustered with positively charged lysines
        of PEDF and the negatively charged GAGs. In the PEDF
        spatial structure, the putative GAG binding domain is
        distinct from and non-overlapping with the neurotrophic
        active region [ 14 20 ] .
        Because PEDF coexists with GAGs in extracellular
        matrices and has binding affinity for them, it is of
        interest to investigate the role of GAGs on PEDF activity.
        Given that binding to cell-surface receptors is the first
        step in the biological activity of PEDF, we used human
        retinoblastoma Y-79 cells and their conditioned media (CM)
        as sources of functional PEDF receptors and extracellular
        matrix components, respectively, to examine the GAG content
        in CM and their effects on PEDF ligand-receptor
        interactions. The data suggest that heparan sulfate
        participates in the formation of a PEDF binding complex
        with its cell-surface receptor, and constitutes a positive
        modulator for the PEDF-receptor interactions.
      
      
        Results
        
          Complex formation between PEDF and component(s) in
          media conditioned by retinoblastoma cells
          To determine whether PEDF interacts with component(s)
          in media conditioned by retinoblastoma cells (CM), we
          used an ultrafiltration assay. In this assay, soluble
          PEDF of 50-kDa is filtered through a membrane with an
          exclusion limit of MW 100,000, however it is retained
          upon formation of a complex larger than this limit [ 14 ]
          . The binding reactions were with a given 125I-PEDF
          concentration and CM. Incubations were at 4°C to minimize
          enzymatic degradation of proteins and glycosaminglycans
          during the reaction. We found that 22% of 125I-PEDF was
          retained by the membrane in the presence of concentrated
          CM, compared to only 4% retention in the presence of
          defined medium (non-conditioned medium) concentrated in
          an identical fashion. Specific retention, termed PEDF
          bound, was calculated by subtracting the retention in
          defined media from that in CM. Figure 1shows that PEDF
          was specifically retained when mixed with soluble
          conditioned media and the value for PEDF bound increased
          proportionally to the concentration factor of the media
          (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, protease treatment of the CM
          did not abolish the binding (Fig. 1B). These observations
          revealed that the retained forms in the CM were PEDF
          complexes ≥ 100-kDa, and that the majority of these
          complexes were formed with soluble CM components other
          than proteins.
        
        
          Heparin and HS in the conditioned media with
          affinity for PEDF
          GAGs and polyanions in the CM were fractionated by
          anion-exchange column chromatography followed by
          PEDF-affinity column chromatography (Fig. 2). The GAG
          content was followed by staining with Toluidine Blue-O
          (Fig. 2C,2D,2E). The final fraction (CM PEDF) contained
          components with binding affinity for PEDF that stained
          with Toluidine Blue-O and migrated as high molecular
          weight GAGs.
          To determine the type of sulfated GAG in the media, we
          designed a spectrophotometric assay using heparinase and
          heparitinase, specific degrading enzymes for heparin and
          HS, respectively (Fig. 3). The activities of both GAG
          lyases reached a plateau by one hour of incubation (Figs.
          3A,3C) and the degradation of GAG substrates between 0-30
          μg was linear. Both CM and CM PEDFcontained substrates
          for heparinase and heparitinase (Figs. 3B,3D). The amount
          of GAGs was determined by comparison of the amount of Δ
          4-hexuronate produced with CM samples to the standard
          curves with commercial GAGs. The estimated content of
          GAGs in CM varied between 12.4-22.7 μg/ml for heparin and
          between 9-10 μg/ml for HS-like molecules, among media
          conditioned by three different batches of Y-79 cells. The
          estimated GAG content in CM PEDFranged 0.2-1.8 μg/μl and
          0.1-0.4 μg/μl for heparin and HS, respectively. Similar
          assays were followed with chondroitinase ABC, but its
          substrates, ΔDi4S, dermatan and ΔDi6S, in CM were below
          detection limits. These results demonstrated that CM and
          CM PEDFcontained heparin- and HS-like molecules,
          demonstrating that Y-79 cells produced GAGs with binding
          affinity for PEDF.
        
        
          Media conditioned by retinoblastoma cells enhances
          the 125I-PEDF binding to cell-surface receptors
          We have demonstrated previously that biologically
          active 125I-PEDF binds specifically, competitively and
          with high affinity to cell-surface receptors of Y-79
          cells [ 18 ] . Because the reaction conditions were
          identical to those used for biological assays, the
          binding reactions were performed in the presence of media
          conditioned by the cells for 16 hours (CM). We
          investigated the effect of components of the CM, a source
          of extracellular matrix, on the PEDF-receptor
          interactions using CM and non-conditioned defined media
          in radioligand binding assays. Comparison of reactions in
          the absence and presence of CM showed that the specific
          PEDF-binding to Y-79 cell-surface receptors was 6.8-fold
          higher with conditioned medium than with defined medium
          (Fig. 4). Note that with the binding method used, the
          amount of 125I-PEDF retained in CM without cells is the
          same to the amount of non-specific 125I-PEDF binding
          (reactions with cells and in the presence of 50-fold
          molar excess of unlabeled PEDF) [ 18 ] , indicating
          retention by PEI-treated glass-fiber filters of
          PEDF-receptor or GAG-PEDF-receptor complexes rather than
          PEDF-GAG. Similar results were obtained when the
          cell-bound 125I-PEDF was separated by centrifugation,
          rather than filtration through glass-fiber filters, and
          comparing reactions with CM versus those with 1% BSA in
          PBS (data not shown). These observations showed that a
          component(s) secreted by retinoblastoma cells enhanced
          the PEDF-receptor interactions.
        
        
          Effect of GAG lyases and chlorate on 125I-PEDF
          binding to cell-surface receptors
          To deplete the Y-79 cell cultures of HS and
          heparin-like GAGs, we used heparitinase and heparinase,
          respectively. The cultures were pretreated with each GAG
          lyase before using them in radioligand binding assays.
          The morphology and viability of the cells were not
          affected with the GAG lyase treatments. Figure 5Ashows
          that specific 125I-PEDF binding decreased significantly
          in heparitinase treated cultures compared to untreated
          controls, and less drastically in heparinase treated
          ones. Hyaluronidase treatment to deplete the cultures of
          hyaluronan did not have an effect on the binding. These
          results demonstrated that removal of heparin/HS from the
          cell cultures decreased the PEDF binding to receptors on
          Y-79 cells. Chlorate is a competitive inhibitor of
          ATP-sulfurylase, and inhibition of GAG sulfation in cell
          cultures can be achieved by pretreatment of the cultures
          with 30 mM sodium chlorate [ 21 ] . The effect of
          undersulfated GAGs on the PEDF binding to its receptor
          was examined. Cells pretreated with sodium chlorate did
          not show changes in viability or morphology; however, the
          treatment resulted in a decrease in the specific
          125I-PEDF binding to about 35% relative to untreated
          controls (Fig. 5B). Sodium sulfate was used to recover
          the loss of GAG sulfation by chlorate increasing the
          binding to 55% maximal with 10 mM sulfate additions. The
          data revealed that inhibition of sulfation of GAGs
          reduced the PEDF binding to cell-surface receptors of
          Y-79 cells, with about 20% of specific inhibition. Thus,
          these observations implied that HS/heparin might play a
          functional role in the binding of PEDF to its
          cell-surface receptor.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        It has been proposed that the GAG-binding property of
        PEDF provides the molecular basis for its association with
        extracellular matrices and may serve to localize PEDF
        activity in the retina and CNS [ 14 19 ] . However, the
        present results point to direct effects these
        polysaccharides might have on the biochemical interactions
        between PEDF and PEDF receptors on the surfaces of cells
        that respond to this neurotrophic factor. We have shown
        that the binding of PEDF to receptors in retinoblastoma
        cells is enhanced by the presence of extracellular
        heparin/HS-like GAGs, which can be found in the culture
        medium of retinoblastoma cells. The fact that the binding
        of PEDF to cell surfaces decreases with heparin/HS
        depletion, implies that heparin/HS molecules might act as
        cofactors for PEDF-receptor interactions. Interactions
        between PEDF and extracellular GAGs can also explain the
        complex formed by PEDF with CM even after protease
        treatment of the latter. The PEDF-heparin/HS complex may
        somehow facilitate encounters between PEDF and its
        receptor, 
        e.g. , by inducing a conformational
        change in PEDF, which might accelerate the ligand-receptor
        interactions. In addition, the receptor may also form a
        complex with heparin/HS to facilitate interactions with the
        ligand.
        To our knowledge, this is the first report on the
        production of GAGs by retinoblastoma cells. We found that
        these cells produce HS/heparin secreted into the culturing
        media. The retina and malignant solid tumors also produce
        the sulfated GAGs [ 1 2 22 23 24 25 26 ] . Although HSs are
        mostly found as proteoglycans associated with the basal
        lamina or the plasma membrane, the presence of HSs in the
        culturing medium might be a result of shedding or release
        of their extracellular domains from the cell membranes as
        soluble components. Cell-associated HS proteoglycans can
        undergo regulated shedding from the membrane into the
        soluble extracellular matrix or culturing medium converting
        the membrane anchored molecules into soluble effectors [ 1
        2 ] . In the conditioned media of all the tested batches of
        retinoblastoma cells, we detected heparin and HS with
        binding affinity for PEDF. The estimated concentrations of
        these GAGs in the media may vary with cell density and
        conditioning time. However, under the conditions used, they
        were within the linear range of HS-PEDF complex formation (
        
        EC 
        50 = 40 μg/ml) [ 14 ] .
        The fact that depletion of heparin/HS-like GAGs from the
        culturing media results in inhibition of PEDF binding to
        cell surface receptors points to functional roles for these
        GAGs such as those of positive modulators of PEDF-receptor
        interactions. In this regard, we observed that depletion
        from the Y-79 cell cultures of heparin with heparinase was
        lower than those depleted of HS with heparitinase,
        suggesting that the retinoblastoma-derived HS was more
        effective than the retinoblastoma-derived heparin. This
        observation can be explained by structural, compositional
        and functional differences between heparin and HS GAGs.
        GAG-binding proteins can be differentially sensitive to
        variations in GAG structure [ 27 ] . GAGs produced among
        different cell types have structural and compositional
        differences and structural changes in GAGs are known to
        occur in cells undergoing morphological differentiation
        and/or malignant transformations [ 28 29 30 31 ] . Thus, in
        the native retina, or other tissue, modulation of the
        PEDF-receptor interactions may depend on the expression of
        GAGs, which occur during development and pathological
        conditions.
        Our data offer interesting possibilities of regulation
        of the activity of PEDF. The ratio and amount of production
        of heparin and HS by cells bearing PEDF receptors may be an
        important mechanism to control the activity of PEDF as is
        the modulation of the rate of expression of PEDF receptors.
        The data obtained so far on the action of PEDF on different
        cells may have not considered the presence of these
        cofactors in the media. The binding of GAGs to PEDF that
        modulate the binding of these factors to its receptor opens
        also the possibility that different GAGs may modulate
        differently the affinity of PEDF for its receptors, by
        increasing or even decreasing it in some cases. Finally,
        the fact that the GAG and receptor binding regions are on
        opposite regions of the PEDF molecule, suggest the
        possibility of the existence of PEDF mutants or engineered
        variants that, having lost or decreased GAG-binding
        capabilities, still show high affinity for the PEDF
        receptor in a way not dependent upon GAGs content or
        composition. These possibilities are discussed under the
        consideration that some of them may have important
        implications if PEDF, or molecules derived from it, are to
        be used in the future as therapeutic agents.
        The primary consequence of reducing the heparin/HS and
        its sulfation was to minimize a binding site required for
        PEDF activity. Although GAGs store PEDF in the
        extracellular matrix [ 14 ] , a more direct mechanism
        appears necessary, namely, its participation in the binding
        of PEDF to its receptor. In a spatial structure of PEDF,
        the heparin/HS binding domain of PEDF maps to the opposite
        side of the neurotrophic active region [ 20 ] , allowing
        distinct and non-overlapping interactions with heparin/HS
        on one side of the protein, and with the neurotrophic
        receptor on its opposite side. Our data suggest that the
        intrinsic affinity of the cell surface receptor for PEDF
        appears low, whereas the heparin/HS-PEDF complex is
        recognized with high affinity. In addition, a direct
        interaction between the receptor and GAGs may also be
        necessary. Although details of the mechanism remain to be
        revealed, it is clear that heparin/HS is required for the
        first step of the neurotrophic activity of PEDF, namely the
        encounters with its receptor at the cell surface. The
        differentiation and survival of cells in vivo may be
        regulated not only by the expression of PEDF and its
        receptor but also by the temporal and spatial expression of
        GAGs.

          was purified from BHK cells containing an expression
          vector with human PEDF cDNA, as previously described [ 19
          ] .
        
        
          Preparation of conditioned media
          Human retinoblastoma Y-79 cells (0.45-5 × 10
          6cells/ml) were cultured in defined media (MEM containing
          10 mM HEPES, 1 mM Na-pyruvate, 0.1 mM non-essential amino
          acids, 1 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin
          (LifeTechnologies)) at 37°C for 16-24 h. Media exposed to
          these conditions is referred as CM. CM was separated from
          cells by centrifugation (1000 × 
          g for 5 min at 4°C) and
          concentrated by ultrafiltration using membrane filters
          with MWCO = 10,000 (Amicon YM10 filters). GAGs/polyanions
          purification was performed as follows: concentrated CM
          (15 ml) was dialyzed against buffer Q (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
          8.0, 0.2 M NaCl, 6 M Urea, 0.5% CHAPS), filtered through
          a 0.4 micron membrane and its soluble components
          subjected to anion-exchange column chromatography using
          Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (1 ml bed volume). The column was
          washed with 15-column volumes of buffer Q, the bound
          material eluted with 1.2 M NaCl and termed CM a.
          Alternatively, a DEAE-Sephacel column was used.
        
        
          PEDF-affinity column chromatography
          To identify components with PEDF-binding affinity,
          purified recombinant protein was used to prepare
          PEDF-affinity resin with 3 M Emphaze™ Biosupport Medium
          (Pierce Chemical) [ 18 ] . CM awas dialyzed against
          buffer P (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5%
          CHAPS) and filtrated through 0.4 μm filters. The soluble
          dialysate was mixed with PEDF-resin (6 mg PEDF/ml resin)
          at a 2:1 volume-to-volume ratio and incubated at 4°C with
          gentle rocking for 16 h. The mixture was packed into a 10
          ml Polyprep chromatography column (Bio-Rad) and washed
          with 10-column volumes of buffer P. The bound material
          was eluted with 10-column volumes of 3 M NaCl, desalted
          with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, treated for
          protein depletion, dialyzed against deionized water,
          lyophilized and resuspended in deionized water. The final
          sample was termed CM PEDF. About 100 μl of CM PEDFwere
          obtained from 100 ml of CM. Alternatively, concentrated
          CM was used as starting material and protein depletion
          was omitted.
        
        
          Radioligand binding assays
          PEDF binding to cell-surface receptors was assayed
          using biologically active radioligand 125I-PEDF and Y-79
          cells [ 18 ] by a widely-used method with a mechanism of
          retention of receptors on polyethylenimine-treated
          glass-fiber filters based mainly on ionic interactions [
          32 ] . Polyethylenimine binds strongly to glass, which is
          negatively charged and integral membrane proteins tend to
          be acidic. The resultant polycationic
          polyethylenimine-coated glass can retain cell membranes
          due to their negative charges. Because binding of
          cell-surface receptors to polyethylenimine filters is
          rather insensitive to ionic strength, the ionic
          phenomenon is thought to be supplemented by hydrophobic
          forces and hydrogen binding [ 32 ] . The method used with
          Y-79 cells and radiolabeled PEDF has been described
          before in detail [ 18 ] . Briefly, cells cultured
          overnight in serum-deprived medium at 37°C were
          transferred to ice/water bath for 10 minutes before the
          addition of ligand. The reaction mixtures containing cell
          suspensions with given radioligand concentrations in
          untreated or treated media were incubated at 4°C for 90
          min, unless indicated. The free and bound 125I-PEDF were
          separated by filtration through glass-fiber filters and
          the bound radioactivity was determined in the filters
          using a β-scintillation counter (Beckman, model LS 3801).
          Nonspecific binding was calculated from reactions with a
          molar-excess of unlabeled ligand (≥ 50-fold) over
          radioligand.
        
        
          Complex-formation assays
          Complex formation between PEDF and CM components was
          assayed by a method using ultrafiltration through
          membranes of 100,000 MW exclusion limit [ 14 ] . Binding
          reactions were performed with a given concentration of
          125I-PEDF in defined or conditioned media, and
          incubations with gentle rotation at 4°C for 2 h. Free and
          bound ligand were separated by ultrafiltration through
          Microcon-100 (Amicon). The reaction mixtures were diluted
          40-fold with cold 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.5, 20 mM
          NaCl, 10% glycerol and immediately ultrafiltrated,
          repeating twice to ensure removal of free ligand from the
          complexes. Each Microcon retenate cup was transferred to
          scintillation vials, mixed with 5 ml BioSafe II liquid
          scintillation solution (Research Products International)
          by extensive vortexing, and its radioactivity determined
          using a β-scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding,
          calculated from reactions with an excess of unlabeled
          ligand (100-fold) over radioligand, reached about 40% of
          the total binding.
        
        
          Enzymatic digestion treatments
          The presence of GAGs was assayed using specific GAG
          lyases, 
          i.e. , the presence of heparin, HS,
          and chondroitin sulfates with heparinase, heparitinase,
          and chondroitin ABC respectively. The amount of GAGs was
          determined by the amount of Δ 4-hexuronate produced after
          the eliminative cleavage of each substrate by the
          corresponding GAG lyase. Samples were depleted of
          proteins by protease treatment to avoid interference in
          absorbance readings of the product. For heparinase and
          heparitinase reactions, samples were treated with 5
          milliunits of each enzyme in 150 μl of 0.1 M sodium
          acetate and 1 mM CaCl 
          2 , pH 7 and incubations at 37°C for
          various time periods. The reactions were stopped by the
          addition of 1 ml of 0.06 M HCl. The soluble material was
          separated by centrifugation (3000 × 
          g , 10 min) and assayed for
          absorbance at 235 nm to measure the concentration of
          product Δ 4-hexuronate (Molar extinction coefficient =
          5500; [ 33 ] ). For the chondroitinase ABC reactions,
          each chondroitin sulfates A, B and C substrate (1 mg
          each) and concentrated CM, were incubated with 0.12 units
          of chondroitinase ABC in 1 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,
          60 mM sodium acetate, and 0.02% BSA at 37°C. At various
          time periods, aliquots of 0.1 ml were removed and mixed
          with 0.9 ml of 45 mM KCl pH 1.8 to stop the reaction.
          Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (1000 × 
          g , 10 min) and the supernatant
          assayed for absorbance of Δ 4-hexuronate at 232 nm. For
          protein depletion, CM was mixed with subtilisin at 0.4
          μg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10% glycerol and
          incubated at 37°C for 16 h. Subtilisin was
          heat-inactivated at 75°C for 25 min. The protein
          concentration after the reaction was less than 0.1% of
          the starting material.
          To deplete cell cultures of GAGs, Y-79 cells in
          defined serum-free medium (as above) at a density of 1.25
          × 10 5cells/ml were cultured in 96-well culture plates
          (150 μl/well) and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO 
          2 environment for 16 h. Hyaluronidase
          (>1TRU/μl), heparinase (1 mu/μl) or heparitinase (1
          mu/μl) were each added to various wells and incubated at
          37°C in a 5% CO 
          2 environment for 1 h.
        
        
          Chlorate treatment of cell cultures
          To prevent sulfation of GAGs in cell cultures, we used
          a method previously described [ 33 ] . Y-79 cells (1.25 ×
          10 5cells/ml) were cultured in 48-well plates (300
          μl/well) in defined serum-free medium with or without 30
          mM sodium chlorate and 10 mM sodium sulfate at 37°C in a
          5% CO 
          2 environment for 24 h.
        
        
          GAG detection assays
          GAGs and proteins resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel
          electrophoresis in Tricine/SDS buffer, as instructed by
          manufacturer (Novex), were detected with specific stains.
          For GAG detection, the gels were incubated sequentially
          in 0.2% Toluidine Blue-O in ethanol-water-acetic acid
          (50:49:1) for 30 minutes, in ethanol-water-acetic acid
          (50:49:1) for 1 h, and in H 
          2 O for 16 h. [ 34 ] . For protein
          detection, the gels were sequentially incubated in 0.5%
          Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 50% methanol/10% acetic acid
          and in 10% methanol/10% isopropanol. GAG detection was
          also performed by the Toluidine Blue-O precipitation and
          dot-blot method as described previously [ 34 ] . Briefly,
          200 μl of sample were applied to each well of a 48-well
          manifold (Life Technologies) onto a PVDF membrane without
          vacuum. Then, 5 μl of 0.2% Toluidine blue-O were added to
          each well and vacuum was applied. The membrane was
          removed, washed twice with destaining solution
          (ethanol-water-acetic acid, 50:49:1) for 5 min and
          air-dried.
        
        
          Other methods
          The protein concentration was determined using BioRad
          Protein Assay (BioRad).
