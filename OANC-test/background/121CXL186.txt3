      Each day you participate directly and indirectly in a search for a
      cure for cancer through your work with Walther Cancer Institute. By
      sharing your expertise, you join a network of professionals committed to
      finding ways to eliminate cancer as a cause of suffering and death.
      Once a year, we ask you to consider supporting the mission of the
      Institute in another way -- through a charitable contribution.
      Just as a disease as complex as cancer will not be cured by just one
      scientist at just one university, finding better ways to prevent, treat
      and eventually cure cancer will require support from all of us.
      Please use the enclosed form and envelope to send a contribution
      through a check or credit card. Or, you may use payroll deduction to make
      your gift.
      Your gift may be restricted to the research area of your choice.
      Please indicate the specific research area on the enclosed form. In
      addition, please provide your phone number in case we have any questions.
      Gifts designated for a specific area of research are matched on a
      one-to-one basis by a special fund established by our Board of
      Directors.
      As with all gifts to the Institute, 100% of your contribution will be
      used directly for research. Our endowment allows us to use your money
      exclusively for cancer research, not administrative overhead.
      Please call Sharyl Hamblen at 921-2049 or Kim Gattle at 921-2056 if
      you have any questions. Thank you again for sharing our hope for a future
      without cancer.
      Happy Holidays,
