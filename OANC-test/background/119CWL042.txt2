      Dear Friend of the YMCA:
      It's hard to believe that school is beginning and Autumn will be here
      in just a few short weeks. Children are back in their classrooms enjoying
      the fun of renewing friendships and activities interrupted by summer
      vacation.
      However, some families in our community are wrestling with the problem
      of providing a safe and caring environment for their children during,
      before and after school hours. You can help.
      It is not widely recognized that in our community there are families
      in need. Each year the Hamilton County YMCA awards over $50,000 in
      scholarships to families who are at or near poverty. Many of these
      scholarships are for before and after school care for children of working
      parents.
      The funds for these scholarships come from concerned neighbors like
      you who contribute in the YMCA's Invest in Youth Program. Please consider
      a gift of $25 or more to help insure that a Hamilton County child will be
      in safe, age appropriate activities before and after school. Give a youth
      a chance to receive help with homework, healthy snacks, and value-based
      programs that are fun. Every dollar you give goes directly to
      scholarships for youth in our community.
      Together we can build strong kids, strong families and a strong
      community.
      Thank you.
      Sincerely,
      Pam McConey Executive Director--Hamilton County YMCA
