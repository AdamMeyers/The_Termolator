      One of the biggest challenges you face may be to find qualified,
      educated people to fill positions in your company.
      The number of companies reporting a shortage of skilled workers almost
      doubled from 1995 to 1998; from 27 percent to more than 47 percent. Did
      you know that about 20 percent of America's workers have low basic skills
      and 75 percent of unemployed adults have reading or writing
      difficulties?
      Indy Reads is working to change that!
      The literacy statistics change little from year to year.
      Did you know that the combined efforts of all literacy programs in the
      country reach only ten percent of adults with reading problems? The
      Department of Labor estimates business and taxpayers foot a bill of $60
      billion a year; a bill caused by workplace accidents, lost productivity,
      unrealized tax revenues, welfare payments and crime.
      Indy Reads is working to change these statistics, one life at a
      time.
      Since 1984, Indy Reads (formerly the Greater Indianapolis Literacy
      League) has provided tutoring to adults in Marion County reading at the
      very lowest level of literacy. Today, in addition to one-on-one tutoring,
      we offer small group and English as a Second Language tutoring and
      video-based instruction for adults with learning disabilities.
      We bring together dedicated adult learners and committed, well-trained
      volunteers.
      Because we believe everyone in our community should have an
      opportunity to learn to read and write, we are asking you to help by
      sending your contribution to Indy Reads today.
      Indy Reads students make gains in reading, writing and language. They
      gain organization and leadership skills and continually strive to change
      their lives by developing these skills.
      Will you help them change?
      Indy Reads is changing lives, changing families, and changing the
      employment prospects for hundreds of men and women in our community. We
      need your support. Please consider a contribution to Indy Reads.
      Corporate contributors will be acknowledged in our newsletter, annual
      report and on the Indy Reads webpage.
      We hope you will become a partner of Indy Reads as we work to improve
      our community through literacy.
      Thank you for your concern and support of Indy Reads.
      Sincerely,
      Lis Daily, WTHR channel 13 Honorary Chair Corporate Fund Drive Indy
