        Proteins recognizing specific DNA sequences play an
        important role in the regulation of gene expression and in
        DNA replication. Nearly all eukaryotic genes transcribed by
        RNA Polymerase II for instance, contain the conserved TATA
        box which is present upstream of the transcription start
        site. The TATA-box binding protein, a ~30 kDa component of
        the TFIID complex binds specifically to the heptanucleotide
        A and T residues [ 1 ] and forms the core of the
        transcription initiation complex. Additionally, many
        specific transcription factors bind to the upstream
        promoter in a sequence specific manner and regulate gene
        expression. For example in 
        Drosophila , a heat-shock
        transcription factor (HSTF) can bind to consensus
        heat-shock response elements [ 2 ] and regulates expression
        of heat/stress inducible genes. Promoter activity in later
        branching eukaryotes is greatly modulated by enhancer and
        repressor sequences which have no activity of their own but
        are the targets of DNA biding proteins or protein complexes
        which can remodel the promoter chromatin to make it more or
        less accessible to RNA polymerase. Biochemical assays have
        shown that the action of ATP-dependent chromatin
        remodelling activities increase the accessibility of DNA
        within chromatin templates. 
        S. cerevisiae SWI/SNF [ 3 ] , Ino80
        complex [ 4 ] , 
        Drosophila NURF [ 5 ] are examples of
        some high molecular weight chromatin remodelling factors
        which can facilitate transcription by binding to
        chromatinized DNA templates. However, none of the above
        chromatin remodelling factors binds to specific DNA
        sequences.
        Unlike transcription, the role of sequence specific DNA
        binding proteins in eukaryotic DNA replication is not well
        characterized. In higher eukaryotes finding of specific DNA
        sequences essential for DNA replication has been elusive so
        far. In yeast 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae , a
        six-protein origin recognition complex binds to ARS
        consensus sequence (ACS) in a sequence specific manner [ 6
        ] . Individual ORC subunits have not been demonstrated to
        show DNA binding activity 
        in vitro . Recently, in an 
        in vitro study ScCdc6 has been shown
        to bind double stranded DNA [ 7 ] . The minimal requirement
        for the binding of Cdc6 to DNA has been mapped within its
        N-terminal 47-amino acid sequence. 
        Saccharomyces pombe ORC4 subunit has
        been reported to contain DNA binding activity by using its
        N-terminal AT hook region [ 8 ] . Neither ScCdc6 nor SpORC4
        showed any sequence specific DNA binding activity.
        Recombinant six protein 
        Drosophila ORC (DmORC) binds to ACE
        region of the 
        Drosophila chorion gene [ 9 ] . 
        In vivo , DmORC co-localized with the
        amplified chorion gene locus. In Xenopus, biochemical
        analysis of replication and cell cycle events using egg
        extracts has helped to understand the mechanism of
        eukaryotic DNA replication [ 10 ] . However, two
        dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis of the rDNA locus
        showed that replication initiated at all sites tested [ 11
        ] . All six human homologs of yeast and 
        Drosophila ORC subunits have been
        cloned and characterized [ 12 13 ] . Other replication
        proteins like Cdc6, Cdt1, MCMs, Cdc45 that are essential
        for initiation of DNA replication have also been reported [
        12 ] . Conservation of replication factors among higher
        eukaryotes suggests that functionally they may play similar
        roles.
        In an attempt to identify DNA binding activity of human
        Cdc6, it was expressed and purified as a GST-Cdc6 fusion
        protein from baculovirus infected Sf9 insect cells.
        Partially purified fractions (reduced glutathione eluate)
        containing GSTCdc6 or GST showed an ACS binding activity in
        an ATP dependent manner. The GSTCdc6 protein fraction
        contained both the GSTCdc6 and a 35 KDa 
        S. frugiperda protein. The DNA
        binding activity was confined to a 35 kDa polypeptide. It
        was latter found that the p35 has an intrinsic affinity to
        GST. This polypeptide bound to yeast ACS like elements in
        the presence of ATP. 9/11 matches to ARS consensus sequence
        were found to be essential for this DNA binding activity
        both by gel shift assay as well as by in vitro foot
        printing assay. A DNA fragment containing 9/11 matches from
        human c-myc replication origin region also showed p35
        binding activity suggesting that this polypeptide has
        intrinsic DNA binding activity. The implications of this
        DNA binding activity are discussed here.
      
      
        Results
        
          Partially purified protein fractions containing
          GSTCdc6 or GST contain an ACS binding activity
          We infected Sf9 insect cells with the baculovirus
          expressing GSTCdc6. Cells were harvested 48 hours post
          infection and the proteins were extracted according to
          the procedures described in materials and methods. The
          GSTCdc6 protein was partially purified by pull down on
          glutathione beads (Fig. 1A). The partially purified
          protein was used in DNA binding assays with a 240 bp DNA
          fragment containing all three conserved boxes (A, B1 and
          B2) of the ARS consensus sequences (Fig. 7A& 7B). As
          a control, we used GST alone, which was purified using
          the same strategy used for GSTCdc6 purification. A DNA
          protein complex was formed in both the cases as evidenced
          by the retarded mobility of the free 32P phosphate
          labelled probe (Fig 1B). The specificity of the DNA
          binding was examined in a competition reaction by
          increasing the amount of unlabeled DNA fragment
          containing ACS like elements. It was determined that the
          DNA-Protein complex could be competed efficiently by
          increasing amount of unlabelled ACS like DNA (20×, 50×,
          100× and 200× respectively) (Fig 2). A ~350 bp DNA
          fragment from pBlueScript KS +( 
          Hin fI digested and subsequently
          gel purified) of similar base composition did not compete
          with the complex formation in the Electrophoretic
          Mobility Shift Assay when added at a similar
          concentration indicating a degree of specificity in the
          DNA-Protein complex formation (Fig. 2).
        
        
          An unidentified ~35 kDa protein from baculovirus
          infected insect cells is responsible for DNA binding
          activity
          Partially purified fractions containing GSTCdc6 or GST
          showed DNA binding activity. To further fractionate the
          proteins present in the partially purified GSTCdc6
          fraction the glutathione column was washed with 200 mM
          and 300 mM sodium chloride prior to GSTCdc6 elution with
          reduced glutathione. Western blot analysis using anti GST
          antibodies (Fig. 3A) revealed that neither 200 mM nor 300
          mM fractions contained GSTCdc6 (Fig. 3A). GSTCdc6 protein
          was present only in the proteins eluted by reduced
          glutathione. Proteins released by different salt
          fractionation were separated on an SDS-PAGE and
          visualized by silver stain (Figure 3B). A prominent band
          of molecular mass ~35 kDa was visualised both in the 200
          mM and 300 mM salt eluate.
          To check whether the DNA binding activity was due to
          the presence of ~35 kDa band or GSTCdc6 itself, gel shift
          assays were performed either using 50 ng ~35 kDa protein
          obtained from the salt wash or GSTCdc6 by itself (Fig.
          3C). Salt eluate gave a strong band shift which was
          identical with the band shift found with GSTCdc6 found in
          Fig. 2. GSTCdc6 eluted from the beads following high salt
          wash failed to give any band shift suggesting that the
          ~35 kDa polypeptide was responsible for the DNA binding
          activity.
          To further test whether the presence of p35 is
          absolutely required for DNA binding activity, the 300 mM
          salt eluate was dialysed against low salt buffer H/0.15
          and then passed through Superose 12 gel filtration
          column. Each fraction was checked for DNA binding
          activity by gel retardation assay using a 32P labelled
          DNA fragment containing ACS elements. DNA binding
          activity was found only in high molecular weight fraction
          (~670 kDa) (Fig. 4A). Proteins present in the gel
          filtration fractions in the high molecular weight range
          (fractions 13-17) were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by
          silver stain. Surprisingly, p35 was found to be present
          only in the fraction 15 which contains the DNA binding
          activity (Fig. 4B). The presence of p35 in the same
          fraction containing the DNA binding activity strongly
          suggests that p35 is responsible for the binding
          activity.
        
        
          DNA binding activity is ATP dependent
          One of the hallmarks of yeast ORC binding to yeast ARS
          consensus sequences is its ATP dependence [ 6 ] . We were
          interested to see whether the DNA binding activity of the
          ~35 kDa protein is ATP dependent or not. Gel shift assays
          were performed either in the absence or in the presence
          of increasing amount of ATP in the reaction mixture (Fig.
          5). In the absence of ATP, a very weak binding was
          observed whereas with increasing amount of ATP strong
          binding was detected. There is a threshold of ATP
          concentration (6 mM and onwards) which stimulated the
          binding remarkably. A nonhydrolysable ATP analog, ATPγS
          was used in the binding reaction to see whether ATP
          hydrolysis is required for this binding. With increasing
          amount of ATPγS, the band shift was completely inhibited
          suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is required for this DNA
          binding activity. This was confirmed by adding ATP back
          in the reaction mixture when ATPγS was already present in
          the reaction. Under these reaction conditions, increasing
          amount of ATP again stimulated the DNA binding activity
          even in the presence of ATPγS suggesting that ATPγS can
          be competed with ATP and it is the ATP hydrolysis which
          is essential for this DNA binding activity (Fig. 5, lanes
          13 and 14).
        
        
          p35 binds to A, B1 and B2 boxes of ARS consensus
          sequences as revealed by footprinting assay
          After establishing the fact that a protein of
          approximately 35 kDa binds to DNA fragment containing ARS
          consensus sequences, the exact site of binding of the
          protein on the DNA was mapped by copper-phenanthroline
          footprinting assay. Unlike DNaseI,
          1,10-phenanthroline-cuprous complex is a small chemical
          probe which can demark the boundaries of the protected
          region clearly. The protein was bound to a 5' 32P
          labelled 240 bp DNA fragment containing yeast ARS
          consensus sequence and separated from the free DNA by gel
          shift assay. The gel was then treated with
          copper-phenanthroline reagent as described in materials
          and methods. The bound and unbound DNA was purified and
          allowed to run in a sequencing gel (Fig. 6). On the
          T-rich strand (bottom strand) two protected regions were
          observed. The first region entirely covered the A box of
          the ARS consensus sequence and the second region covered
          the overlapping regions of B1 and B2. Therefore the 35
          kDa protein has a strong affinity to bind to A, B1 and B2
          boxes of the ARS consensus sequences. The long stretch of
          protection could be due to multimeric form of p35 or
          could be due to the formation of a higher order
          nucleoprotein complex.
        
        
          p35 binds to A, B1 and B2 boxes and mutation in
          these boxes abolish DNA binding activity
          Previous studies of the structure of ARS1 in both
          plasmid and chromosome contexts have shown that it
          contains one essential DNA element, A, that includes a
          perfect (11/11) match to the ARS consensus sequence (ACS,
          Fig. 7A), and three additional elements, B1, B2, and B3,
          with 9 out of 11 bases match to the ACS that are also
          important for ARS function [ 14 ] . We were interested to
          see whether A, B1 and B2 boxes were sufficient to allow
          p35 binding activity. We used the p21N protein (N
          terminal 150 bases of coding region of p21) [ 15 ] as a
          control. This DNA when incubated with ~35 kDa protein
          does not form a DNA protein complex (Fig 7D). The DNA
          fragment was divided into four subfragments (a, b, c and
          d; Fig. 7B) and subcloned in the middle of p21N fragment.
          Fragment 'a' does not contain any ACS sequence whereas
          fragments b, c and d contain at least one ACS like
          element. All the ACS containing sub fragments (b, c, d)
          showed a mobility shift (Fig. 7D), which suggests that at
          least one ACS like element (either 11/11 match or 9/11
          match to ARS consensus sequence) is essential and
          sufficient for p35 binding activity. This was further
          confirmed by using a subfragment d mutated at the ACS
          motif (Fig. 7C). Subfragment d as shown if Fig 7Dlane 10
          can bind strongly to the 35 kDa protein, however mutation
          altering the A and Ts of the core ACS sequence to G and
          Cs (Fig 7C) to generate the dmut oligonucleotide results
          in the abolition of its ability to bind p35. Therefore
          the ACS sequence is essential for the p35-DNA protein
          complex formation.
        
        
          35 kDa polypeptide binds to ARS consensus sequence
          found in c-myc origin of replication
          In 
          S. cerevisiae , ARS elements have
          been implicated to be important both for ORC binding and
          origin function [ 6 ] . We looked for the availability of
          such sequences in known human origins of replication like
          c-myc, lamin beta 2 and Dnmt1. An origin of replication
          was mapped previously by nascent strand abundance
          analysis within 2.0 kb zone immediately upstream of c-myc
          gene [ 16 ] . Detailed analysis of the 2.0 kb upstream
          sequences revealed the presence of two ACS like elements
          separated by 148 nucleotides (AAAAGATAAAG and
          AAAAGAAAAAA). A 300 bp DNA fragment containing both the
          ACS elements was amplified by polymerase chain reaction
          and the product was used subsequently for p35 binding
          studies.
          A strong band shift was observed (Fig. 8) which could
          be competed out using a 50 bp long double stranded oligo
          containing two ACS like elements (oligo 'b', Fig. 7B).
          Increasing amount of ~65 bp long unrelated (non specific)
          double stranded oligo did not have any effect on this
          binding activity suggesting that binding of p35 to c-myc
          origin region is specific. Interestingly, analysis of
          Lamin beta 2 origin of replication region also revealed
          the presence of two ACS (9/11 match) like elements [ 17 ]
          . Further studies are required to find out whether p35
          also binds to lamin beta 2 origin region.
        
        
          p35-ACS interaction is sensitive to high salt,
          temperature and EDTA
          The stability of p35-ACS DNA complex was further
          tested either by changing NaCl concentration in the
          reaction mixture, or by shifting reaction temperature or
          by adding EDTA. The DNA binding activity was found to be
          sensitive to NaCl concentration (Fig. 9). Strong band
          shift was obtained up to 0.2 M NaCl. NaCl concentration
          at 0.5 M and above completely inhibited the binding
          activity. Higher temperature also showed a drastic effect
          on the binding activity. Normal DNA binding activity was
          observed up to 42°C. Temperature higher than 42°C
          completely abolished the binding activity suggesting that
          the off rate of p35 from DNA is much faster at higher
          temperature. Finally inclusion of EDTA in the reaction
          mixture inhibited the binding reaction suggesting that
          the divalent cations are essential for this binding
          activity.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Few proteins have been reported in the literature, which
        are capable of binding to DNA in a sequence specific ATP
        dependent manner. Although transcription factors bind to
        specific DNA sequences, the binding activity is not
        dependent on ATP hydrolysis. In contrast, chromatin
        remodelling factors like SWI/SNF, ISW1, BRG1 facilitate
        transcription from chromatinised templates in the presence
        of ATP [ 18 ] . However, these factors do not bind to
        specific DNA sequences. In eukaryotic DNA replication,
        sequence specific ATP dependent DNA binding activity has
        been demonstrated in yeast 
        S. cerevisiae where ORC, a six
        polypeptide complex binds to yeast ARS consensus sequence
        in an ATP dependent manner [ 6 ] . The binding sites for
        other ORCs are not very clear at present. DmORC binds the
        critical elements of well-characterized, chromosome III
        amplification domain (ACE3 and ori-β, though the precise
        sequence recognized by DmORC within ACE3 and ori-β have not
        been identified [ 9 ] . Studies of both ScORC [ 19 ] and
        DmORC [ 20 ] indicate the ATP binding by Orc1p is required
        for DNA binding. However ATP hydrolysis is not required for
        DNA binding for both the cases suggesting that ATP
        hydrolysis may be required for further downstream
        processes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies
        have demonstrated the association of SpORC with 
        S. pombe origins [ 21 ] and human ORC
        with the EBV 
        Ori P [ 22 23 24 ] . Whether ORC
        binds to these sequences directly or indirectly with the
        help of other proteins are subject to in vitro DNA binding
        assays using purified ORC proteins.
        In this study, we report a ~35 kDa protein from the
        baculovirus infected Sf9 insect cells that binds to yeast
        ACS sequences in an ATP dependent fashion. p35 was purified
        as high salt (300 mM NaCl) eluate from the GST-Cdc6 beads.
        GST-Cdc6 eluted from the beads following high salt wash
        failed to show any DNA binding activity (Fig. 3C) whereas
        high salt eluate containing only p35 showed strong DNA
        binding activity suggesting that p35 not Cdc6 is
        responsible for the binding activity. This experiment was
        repeated several times and always the protein preparations
        containing p35 showed DNA binding activity.
        p35 has an intrinsic affinity to GST moieties. Sf9
        insect cells were infected with baculovirus expressing GST
        alone. The cell lysate was allowed to bind to GST beads.
        High salt eluate (300 mM NaCl) from GST beads was tested
        for DNA binding activity. Surprisingly, we observed a very
        similar band shift as obtained previously using high salt
        eluate from GSTCdc6 (data not shown). Further, high salt
        eluate from GSTORC2 and GSTORC4 (GST fusion protein
        containing human origin recognition complex subunit 1 and 2
        respectively) also showed DNA binding activity (data not
        shown). Therefore, it can be concluded that p35 interacts
        with GST and high salt concentration is required to disrupt
        this interaction. The nature and the specificity of the
        interaction between GST and p35 are not clear at this
        moment. It is important to note that majority of the p35
        bound to GST or GST fusion proteins are released mostly at
        high salt concentration (300 mM) allowing us to get rid of
        most of the impurities by stringent washing of the GST
        beads with buffer containing 250 mM NaCl.
        A weak DNA binding activity was found till 4 mM ATP
        concentration (Fig. 5). A strong stimulation was obtained
        at 6 mM ATP concentration. It is possible that p35 is
        purified as ATP bound form but an associated weak ATPase
        activity does not allow it to give a strong binding
        activity. It is suggested that 6 mM ATP concentration may
        be sufficient to overcome this inhibitory effect. ATP
        hydrolysis is essential for DNA binding activity of p35
        since ATPγ S, a nonhydrolysable analog of ATP completely
        inhibited the binding activity (Fig. 5). It is possible
        that ATP is required for strand opening which needs to be
        further explored. An insect cell factor, polyhedrin
        promoter binding protein has been reported previously,
        capable of binding to AT rich DNA sequence [ 25 ] .
        However, the reported DNA binding activity was unusual in a
        sense that the activity was heat and salt concentration
        resistant. 100 mM EDTA concentration did not affect the DNA
        binding activity. The DNA binding activity reported in this
        study was found to be temperature, EDTA and salt
        concentration sensitive (Fig. 9) suggesting that this
        polypeptide is completely different from the polyhedrin
        promoter binding protein.
        p35 showed a strong DNA binding affinity towards ACS
        like elements. This was confirmed first by using unlabeled
        specific competitor DNA which completely abolished the
        binding of 32P labelled probe. Competition using unrelated
        DNA did not affect the DNA binding activity. We took p21N,
        which normally does not bind to p35, to further test the
        binding specificity. Introduction of a single ACS like
        element (9/11 match) in p21N (ARSc and ARSd) showed a
        strong band shift (Fig. 7D) suggesting that only one ACS
        like element is sufficient for p35 binding. This was
        further confirmed by making mutations in the ARSd fragment.
        The resulting ARSdmut did not show any p35 binding activity
        suggesting that the ACS like element itself but not the
        adjacent sequences are essential for the p35 binding
        activity. However, a systematic mutational analysis of ACS
        like elements will be required to explore the exact binding
        specificity of p35 towards ACS like elements. ACS elements
        are normally AT rich. However, p35 did not bind to random
        AT rich sequences. p35 did not bind to p21N + ARSa which
        contains ARSa oligo (78% AT rich) with no ACS like element.
        Surprisingly, p35 showed strong binding activity in the
        presence of the oligo ARSb (64% AT rich), ARSc (66% AT
        rich) and ARSd (74% AT rich) respectively (Figure 7D).
        ARSb, c and d contain at least one ACS like element (Fig.
        7B). Finally the copper phenanthroline footprint analysis
        confirmed that p35 binds to A and B1-B2 boxes of the ARS1
        DNA fragment. At this moment, the function of p35 is not
        very clear. It may play major role(s) in the transcription
        of certain insect cell genes. It may as well be responsible
        for DNA replication. The fact that it binds to yeast ACS
        and to a DNA fragment from c-myc origin of replication
        region containing yeast ACS like elements in an ATP
        dependent manner further strengthen the hypothesis. 
        S. cerevisiae origin recognition
        complex (ORC) binds to ARS consensus sequences in an ATP
        dependent fashion and this binding is essential for both
        origin function and activity. It is interesting to note
        that a huge six protein origin recognition complex binds to
        yeast ARS1 whereas p35, a small protein is showing same
        kind of protection as evidenced by foot print analysis
        (Fig. 6). We believe that p35 forms an oligomeric structure
        or it maintains a multimeric form which may explain the
        wide footprint over the ARS1 fragment. The presence of p35
        in high molecular weight fraction (~670 kDa) following
        superose 12 gel filtration chromatography strengthen this
        hypothesis and clearly suggests that p35 forms an
        oligomeric structure.
        ARS consensus sequence has been found near the vicinity
        of c-myc, lamin beta 2 and Dnmt1 replication origin [ 26 ]
        . Therefore, Identification and characterization of this
        protein from insect cells and finding its human counterpart
        will greatly help in elucidating its possible function in
        DNA replication.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The data presented here leads to the identification and
        characterization of a polypeptide from insect cells with
        ATP dependent DNA binding activity. This is an important
        and unique observation. In 
        S. cerevisiae , ACS elements have
        been reported to be essential for ORC binding and
        replication initiation. Yeast ACS like elements found in
        c-myc and lamin beta 2 origin region may play similar roles
        in replication initiation. However, it is also possible
        that p35 is a transcription factor which may facilitate
        transcription of some insect cell genes. Further
        characterization of p35 from insect cells and finding its
        human homolog will be very helpful to dissect its
        functional role in replication and/or transcription.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Plasmid construction
          Cloning of human Cdc6 cDNA is described elsewhere.
          Coding sequence of human Cdc6 was cloned in pFastBac-GST
          vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) to express GST fusion
          protein. A 240 bp DNA fragment from 
          S. cerevisiae ARS1 chromosomal DNA
          replication origin containing all the key elements
          including boxes A, B1, B2 and B3 was subcloned in
          pBlueScript KS(+) between 
          Eco RI and 
          Hin dIII. Subsequently 
          Eco RI- 
          Hin dIII fragment was end labelled
          using γ 32P ATP and used either for gel shift assay or
          copper-phenanthroline foot print assay. p21N, (N terminal
          ~150 bp of p21) was previously cloned in pBlueScript
          KS(+) between 
          Eco RI and 
          Hin dIII sites.
          Complementary oligos corresponding to ARSa, b, c, d
          and dmut (Fig. 7B) were synthesized (~50 bases in length)
          and subsequently annealed to get double stranded oligos.
          p21N/KS(+) construct contains only one 
          Stu I site which is present within
          the p21N insert. All the annealed double stranded oligos
          were cloned into the 
          Stu I site using blunt end
          ligation. The sequences of ARSa, b, c and d are
          followed:

          Plasmid containing 2.5 kb DNA fragment from c-myc
          origin region was a kind gift from Michael Leffak, Wright
          State University Ohio. Forward and reverse PCR primers
          (5'-gaagaaaaactctcttttc-3' and 5'-atttgctgggttgaaaaatg-3'
          respectively) were used to amplify 300 bp region
          containing two ACS like elements.
        
        
          Expression of GSTCdc6 and GST in insect cells and
          purification
          Baculoviruses were produced from the recombinant
          pFB-GST plasmid using Bac-to-Bac expression system (Life
          Technologies Inc.). Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were infected
          with the pFB-GSTCdc6 or pFBGSTbaculovirus according to
          the manufacturers' recommendations. Cells were harvested
          48 hours post-infection. The cell pellet was washed once
          in cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently
          resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris.Cl, pH
          7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
          fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml
          aprotinin, 1 mM dithiothreitol). The cell suspension was
          homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer using a B-type pestle
          followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 7 min. The
          pellet containing the nuclei was lysed in buffer H/0.15
          (50 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 0.02% Nonidet P-40,
          5 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10%
          glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml
          pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM
          dithiothreitol). The resulting suspension was subjected
          to ammonium sulphate precipitation (starting with 10%
          followed by 30% and finally 50%). The pellet after the
          50% ammonium sulphate cut was resuspended in buffer H/0.0
          (no salt) and then dialyzed overnight against buffer
          H/0.15. The dialyzed sample was then bound to GST beads
          (Sigma) and washed three times with buffer H*/0.15
          (containing 150 mM NaCl instead of 150 mM KCl). Proteins
          were eluted using reduced glutathione elution buffer (50
          mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.0, 20 mM reduced glutathione, 0.01%
          Nonidet P-40, 100 mM NaCl).
        
        
          Immunoblotting and Silver stain
          Anti-GST polyclonal antibodies were purchased from
          Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Western blotting technique
          was carried out using standard protocol. The silver stain
          protocol is described elsewhere [ 27 ] .
        
        
          Gel retardation assay
          Gel retardation assay was performed with slight
          modification of the protocol used by Mukhopadhyay et al [
          28 ] . The DNA fragments to be used for gel retardation
          assay were endlabeled with γ 32P ATP. The binding
          reactions were performed in 20 μl of T buffer (50 mM
          Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 
          2 , 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 30 μg/ml
          BSA) supplemented with 5 mM ATP and 6% (v/v) glycerol for
          most of the reactions. The mixture was incubated at 37°C
          for 10 min and loaded directly on a 5% polyacrylamide gel
          in TBE buffer (89 mM Tris base, 89 mM boric acid, 2.5 mM
          EDTA, pH 8.3). The gel was run at 150 V for 2 hours,
          dried and autoradiographed.
        
        
          Copper-phenanthroline footprint assay
          The Copper-phenanthroline footprint assay was
          performed essentially by using the protocol described by
          Kuwabara et al [ 29 ] . The DNA-protein gel is run in the
          absence of free radical scavengers as described in gel
          retardation assay. The gel is placed in 200 ml of 50 mM
          Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The gel is further incubated for 10
          minutes in a solution containing equal volume of solution
          A (40 mM 1,10 Phenanthroline monohydrate in 100% EtOH and
          9 mM Cupric sulphate mixed with equal volume followed by
          1:10 dilution with water) and solution B (0.5%
          3-Merceptopropionic acid in water). Finally the gel is
          soaked in solution C (28 mM 2,9 Dimethyl-1,10
          Phenanthroline in 100% EtOH) for 2 min. The gel is washed
          twice in deionised water. After the pre-treatment of the
          gel, it is autoradiographed and the retarded band is cut
          from the gel and placed in an eppendorf tube. The DNA is
          eluted from the gel slice, denatured and loaded in a
          sequencing gel. The sequencing gel is fixed, dried and
          the bands were visualised by autoradiography.
