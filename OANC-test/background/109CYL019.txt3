      Dear Salutation:
      Who helps United way help ten-year-old Cindy learn responsibility and
      self-esteem at an overnight camp?
      Or who helps Randy break a cycle of violence and become a better
      dad?
      Or who helps David learn important job skills that will enable him to
      become self-sufficient?
      Or who helps Michael, who has spina bifida, learn to talk, dress
      himself, and get around independently?
      Without you. no one.
      And we need your help this year to make sure these services are there
      for you, your family, friends and neighbors in Boone, Hamilton, Hancock,
      Hendricks, Marion and Morgan counties.
      I am writing you in the hope of getting your support for this year's
      United Way campaign. The funds raised by the campaign support a family of
      83 health and human service agencies that provide services like family
      counseling, care for abused children, scouting and youth programs, job
      training, disaster relief and much, much more.
      Your generous support is very important. Here are just some of the
      ways your gift can touch lives right here in central Indiana:
      A gift of $25 could mean five friendly visits to a homebound elderly
      person. A gift of $50 could mean one day of shelter for a victim of
      domestic violence and her children. A gift of $100 could mean two days of
      overnight camping for an underprivileged child. A gift of $200 could mean
      six days of shelter and meals for a homeless person.
      United Way touches the lives of more than 3,100 central Indiana people
      every day, 365 days a year, because people like you are generous. Here
      are some quotes from people whose lives were touched by United Way
      agencies last year:
      "After losing my job due to downsizing, I lost my home, my car and
      nearly everything I owned. You arranged for my daughter to see a doctor
      and to have her medications renewed. Children's Bureau provided bus
      tickets for me to go to interviews. You treated me with dignity and made
      me and my child feel there was hope for the future." -- Karen
      "My Big Brother acts like a friend, but since he's an adult I get to
      make use of all his experience. We do fun stuff that we both like. No
      matter what we do that day, I always seem to learn an important lesson."
      -- Matthew
      "If it were not for the services they provide us, the older persons
      would not be able to get around to do our business, such as visits to
      doctors, grocery and drug stores." -Daniel
      Who helps these people? Without you. no one.
      When you give to United Way, you can rest assured that your gift will
      be used efficiently and effectively to help people in need here at home.
      Knowledgeable community volunteers -- people just like you -- ensure that
      your gift is spent wisely and that 88 PERCENT OF FUNDS RAISED GO TO HELP
      PEOPLE IN NEED RIGHT HERE IN CENTRAL INDIANA.
      Last year, you gave us a contribution of $xx, for which we, and the
      people you helped, are grateful. Please find it in your heart to renew
      your pledge or, if possible, increase it. Just check the appropriate box
      on the enclosed pledge card and return it in the reply envelope.
      Thank you in advance for touching a life and helping to make our
      community a better place to live, work and prosper.
      Sincerely,
      Stephen A. Stitle 1996 United Way of Central Indiana Campaign
