      Just a moment of your time, if you can, to talk about a ten dollar
      bill. True, it won't buy much today, but we are still interested.
      Multiply that ten dollars by our over ___ active supporters and you
      have ___ number of dollars --- not small at all.
      We are asking for your ten dollars to help fund our programs of
      Research, Education, and Patient Service and Rehabilitation.
      We will be grateful for your contribution, and I am sure you will feel
      good about giving. Your check in the enclosed envelope will be greatly
      appreciated.
      Sincerely,
