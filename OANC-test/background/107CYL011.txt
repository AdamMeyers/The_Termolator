      Dear Mr. & Mrs. Smith:
      Holidays are a time for sharing. The sharing of love, of gifts, of
      goodwill towards man. But for many of the children and seniors that
      Visiting Nurse Service cares for, it can also be a troubling time. Nearly
      every day, VNS receives a call about a patient or family in need of home
      care who has limited financial resources. Calls for help from families
      that need the crisis services VNS provides for their children ring
      throughout the season. This is not the ringing that you and I
      traditionally picture during the holiday season.
      But there is something you can do to help. With your gift of sharing,
      we can: provide needed home care services to the most, give emergency
      respite to families of children at risk for neglect or abuse, help
      establish a "Seniors to Seniors" program to provide companionship and
      homemaker services to homebound citizens.
      Visiting Nurse Service has been a part of this community for over 85
      years. Serving the needy has been an important part of our mission. Over
      the last ten years, VNS has delivered over $1 million worth of free
      services to the citizens of Central Indiana. But we can not do it alone.
      We need your help.
      A gift of sharing can bring comfort and hope to those most in need
      during this holiday season. I hope that you will join with us to help
      ease the suffering and indeed ring in a most joyous holiday season.
      Sincerely,
      John L. Pipas President & CEO
