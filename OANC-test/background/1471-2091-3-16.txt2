        The cysteine-loop family of ligand gated ion channels
        (LGIC) is comprised of receptors with pentameric quaternary
        structure and at least two ligand binding sites present at
        the subunit interfaces [ 1 2 ] . This receptor family is
        characterized by the presence of a critical disulfide loop
        structure within the binding site and an integral ion
        selective channel. LGIC receptors are found in both the
        peripheral and central nervous systems. Members of this
        family include the acetylcholine receptors [ 3 4 ] , the
        γ-amino butyric acid type A receptor (GABA 
        A R) [ 5 ] , and the glycine receptor
        (GlyR) [ 6 ] .
        The first subunit of the 5-HT 
        3 R was cloned in 1991 [ 7 ] . The
        sequence of this subunit was shown to be highly homologous
        to LGIC receptors and thus identified the 5-HT 
        3 R receptor as another member of this
        superfamily [ 7 8 9 ] . Similar to other LGIC receptors,
        more than one subtype has been identified. Two splice
        variants of an A subunit (long and short forms), and a
        single B subunit have been cloned [ 10 11 12 13 ] . Both
        the long and short forms of the A subunit are capable of
        forming functional homomeric receptors [5-HT 
        3AL R and 5-HT 
        3AS R] although some differences between
        an agonist and partial agonist activity have been observed
        [ 14 ] . A third subtype is formed by a combination of the
        A and B subunits to produce a heteromeric receptor of
        unknown stoichiometry [ 10 ] . Heteromeric receptors are
        pharmacologically and functionally distinct from the
        homomeric 5-HT 
        3AL and 5-HT 
        3AS receptors [ 11 ] .
        5-HT 
        3 Rs are distributed throughout the
        central and peripheral nervous system, playing a
        significant role in phenomenon such as anxiety, emesis and
        alcoholism. Antagonists to 5-HT 
        3 Rs are clinically efficacious in the
        treatment of chemotherapy-induced emesis [ 15 ] and recent
        studies on human subjects have suggested their potential
        application in the treatment of early onset alcoholism [ 16
        17 ] .
        Hibert 
        et al proposed an early model for the
        antagonist pharmacophore of the 5-HT 
        3 R [ 18 ] . According to this model,
        all 5-HT 
        3 R antagonists contain an aromatic
        ring, a carbonyl oxygen or bioisosteric equivalent, and a
        basic nitrogen. According to Hibert's model, the basic
        nitrogen is located 5.2A° from the centre of the aromatic
        ring and approximately 1.7A° above plane of the ring. The
        carbonyl oxygen and the aromatic ring are coplanar and
        separated by a distance of 3.3A°. Recent studies have
        expanded on this model to include another lipophilic region
        and a second hydrogen bonding interaction two atoms away
        from the first [ 19 20 21 ] . A compound that contains all
        five pharmacophoric regions was synthesized by Orjales 
        et al [ 22 ] . This compound
        (1-(phenylmethyl)-2-piperizinyl benzimidazole or
        lerisetron) is shown in figure 1and is a potent 5-HT 
        3 R antagonist. Functional groups on
        this compound capable of forming interactions with the
        receptor are the distal amino group, a benzimidazole and a
        benzyl group in the N1 position of the benzimidazole. While
        Lerisetron contains no carbonyl group, the second nitrogen
        contained in the benzimidazole heterocycle could act as
        bioisostere of this functional group [ 22 ] . Orjales
        demonstrated the importance of the N-benzyl group by
        synthesizing several N1 substituted analogs of Lerisetron.
        Removal of the N-benzyl group produced a 80-fold decrease
        in affinity, indicating a role for this group in
        interacting with the 5-HT 
        3 R. Other studies have supported this
        observation and suggest a more specific electrostatic
        interaction [ 23 ] .
        While structure-activity relationship studies and
        molecular modeling have led to the development of a
        detailed pharmacophore model, determining specific point
        interactions between 5-HT 
        3 antagonists and binding site amino
        acids has proven difficult. Mutagenesis studies have
        identified the interaction of amino acids W89 and R91 in
        the binding of 5-HT 
        3 R ligands [ 24 23 ] . Studies
        conducted in our laboratory have identified three
        additional putative binding site residues (Y140, Y142, and
        Y152) [ 25 ] . W89 and R91 are present in a conserved
        region of LGIC receptors often referred to as loop D [ 24
        26 ] . Similarly, Y140, Y142 and Y152 are located in the
        region homologus to E loop region of nicotinic AchR.
        In this study, we have endeavoured to identify the amino
        acids interacting with the different functional groups
        present on the lerisetron molecule in order to develop a
        model for interaction of this compound with the 5-HT 
        3 R. Using site directed mutagenesis in
        combination with analogs of lerisetron, we have identified
        amino acids that appear to interact selectively with the
        terminal amino group, the N-benzyl group and the aromatic
        benzimidazole.
      
      
        Results
        
          Functional activity of lerisetron
          Whole cell patch-clamp experiments were performed to
          test the functional activity of lerisetron. No response
          was observed when lerisetron was applied alone (data not
          shown). When co-applied with 5-HT, lerisetron inhibited
          the absolute magnitude of the response with no apparent
          alteration of the response profile (Figure 2). The
          combination of several identical inhibition experiments
          produced a K 
          i value of 0.2 ± 0.03 nM for
          lerisetron inhibition of the 5-HT induced response. These
          data correspond well with previously reported data for
          this compound [ 22 ] and verify the competitive
          antagonist action of lerisetron. Analogs of lerisetron
          have been shown to inhibit 5-HT 
          3 Rs in a similar manner [ 23 ] .
        
        
          Importance of the N-benzyl and distal piperazine
          nitrogen to binding of lerisetron
          The K 
          i value for lerisetron inhibition of [
          3H]-granisetron binding to wildtype receptors was
          determined to be 0.8 ± 0.19 nM (Figure 3and Table 1).
          This value agrees with previously published data for this
          compound. The K 
          i values for analogs 1 and 2 under
          identical conditions are 25 ± 3.2 nM and 320 ± 82 nM
          respectively (Figure 4A, Table 1). The observed change in
          K 
          i represents the decreases in binding
          energy resulting from removal of the N-benzyl group
          (analog 1) and the distal piperazine nitrogen (analog
          2).
        
        
          Identification of amino acids interacting with
          Lerisetron
          In order to determine the nature of the amino acids
          interacting with the distal amino and N-benzyl groups of
          lerisetron, we constructed 5-HT 
          3AS Rs containing mutations at W89,
          R91, Y140, Y142 and Y152. Figure 3shows inhibition of [
          3H]-granisetron binding by lerisetron on wildtype and
          mutant receptors. For most amino acids, an alanine
          substitution was constructed in order to effectively
          remove any amino acid interaction with the ligand. For
          W89, an alanine substitution has been shown to prevent
          binding of [ 3H]granisetron; therefore a less severe
          mutation was constructed.
          The W89F mutation produces a 18-fold change in K 
          d for [ 3H]-granisetron binding (18 ±
          2 nM) and the W89Y mutation produces a 5.8-fold change in
          K 
          d (5.7 ± 0.7 nM). Mutation of amino
          acid R91 to alanine produced a 5-fold change in K 
          d for [ 3H]granisetron binding (4.9 ±
          0.7 nM) (Table 1). These data agree well with previously
          reported values [ 24 ] . Alanine mutations at the
          tyrosine positions Y140, Y142 and Y152 also produced
          minor increases in K 
          d for [ 3H]granisetron binding (2.7 ±
          0.19 nM, 4.5 ± 0.5 nM and 7.8 ± 1.1 nM respectively) [ 25
          ] (Table 1).
          Only small changes in K 
          i for lerisetron were observed for the
          Y140A mutation while the Y142A and Y152A mutations
          produced large increases in the K 
          i (Table 1and Figure 3). For W89F and
          W89Y, the changes in K 
          i observed for lerisetron were much
          smaller than for the alanine mutations at Y142A and
          Y152A, as would be expected for the less severe nature of
          these mutations. The changes were, however significant (p
          < 0.001 in both cases) and are similar to the changes
          in K 
          d reported for [ 3H]granisetron. The
          increase in K 
          i on the W89F mutant receptor was 4.8
          ± 0.56 fold and the increase in K 
          i on the W89Y receptor was 3.6 ± 0.4
          fold. The R91A mutant produced an increase in K 
          i of 7.6 ± 1.5 fold as compared to the
          wildtype receptor. These data indicated potential
          interactions of lerisetron with W89, R91, Y142 and
          Y152.
        
        
          Mutation of W89
          As mentioned above, the lack of [ 3H]-granisetron
          binding to W89A mutant receptors necessitated the use of
          W89F and W89Y mutations to analyze functional group
          interactions. The effects of these mutations on the K 
          i for analogs 1 and 2 are shown in
          figure 4B, 4Cand Table 1. Analog 1 inhibited [
          3H]-granisetron binding to W89F receptors with a K 
          i of 170 ± 54 nM (7 ± 3.2 fold
          increase, p < 0.001) and W89Y receptors with a K 
          i of 81 ± 14 nM (3.2 ± 0.6 fold
          increase, p < 0.001). This reflects a significant
          increase in K 
          i and reflects a potential interaction
          of analog 1 with W89. The strength of this interaction is
          apparently similar to the strength of the interaction
          with [ 3H]-granisetron and lerisetron since the magnitude
          of the change is similar in both cases. Analog 2 also
          showed a significant increase in K 
          i as a result of the W89F and W89Y
          mutations. The magnitude of the change for W89F (5.1 ±
          1.3 fold, p < 0.05) was similar to that observed for
          lerisetron and analog 1. The W89Y mutation produced a 6.8
          ± 1.6 fold change in K 
          i (p < 0.05). Thus, all three
          compounds appear to form similar interactions with
          W89.
        
        
          Mutation of R91
          Mutation of R91 to alanine (R91A) resulted in a
          significant, but small increase in K 
          i for lerisetron of 7.6 ± 1.5 fold (p
          < 0.01). Figure 4Dshows the inhibition of [
          3H]-granisetron binding by analogs 1 and 2 at R91A mutant
          receptors. No significant change in K 
          i was observed on these receptors for
          either analog 1 (0.9 ± 0.28 fold) or analog 2 (0.56 ±
          0.14 fold) (Table 1) as compared to the wildtype
          receptor.
        
        
          Mutation of Y142
          Mutation of Y142 to alanine produced one of the
          largest observed changes in K 
          i for lerisetron (Figure 3and Table
          1). The K 
          i obtained for lerisetron was 130 ± 28
          nM, reflecting a change of 160 ± 37 fold compared to
          wildtype receptors. The K 
          i value for analog 1, in contrast,
          increased only 6.8 ± 2.3 fold (p < 0.01) as a result
          of this mutation (Figure 4Eand Table 1). The K 
          i for analog 2 showed a similar change
          of 17 ± 0.77 fold (p < 0.01). While these K 
          i values are significantly different
          from wildtype values for each analog, the lack of larger
          effects suggests that neither analog 1 nor analog 2 bind
          as strongly as lerisetron to Y142.
        
        
          Mutation of Y152
          The Y152A mutation showed the most variability in its
          effects on K 
          i values for lerisetron, analog 1 and
          analog 2 (Figure 3, Figure 4Fand Table 1). Lerisetron
          inhibited [ 3H]-granisetron binding with a K 
          i value of 150 ± 36; an increase of
          190 ± 43 fold compared to wildtype values. The K 
          i value for analog 1 increased from 25
          ± 3.2 nM (wildtype) to 2.5 ± 0.40 μM. This change of 100
          ± 16 fold is slightly smaller, but not significantly
          different from the relative change observed for
          lerisetron. The K 
          i for analog 2 increased from 0.32 ±
          0.08 μM on wildtype to 13 ± 4.2 μM on Y152A mutant
          receptors (40 ± 12 fold increase). The increase observed
          for analog 2 was significantly less than that observed
          for both lerisetron and analog 1. The smaller change in K
          
          i for analog 2 suggests that analog 2
          binds weakly to Y152 while lerisetron and analog 1 bind
          more tightly.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Functional group interactions of W89
          The W89F mutation produced a significant increase in K
          
          i for all three compounds. The
          magnitude of the change was similar in all cases. In
          addition, the increase in K 
          i was identical to the increase in K 
          d that has been observed for [
          3H]granisetron binding on this mutant [ 24 ] .
          Alterations in K 
          i resulting from the W89Y mutation
          were slightly less, however the change was again the same
          for lerisetron, analog 1 and analog 2. These data suggest
          that all three compounds form binding site interactions
          with W89. The interaction between lerisetron and W89 is
          unlikely to be via the N-benzyl functional group since
          the K 
          i for analog 1 was also altered by
          this mutation. The same argument can be made for the
          distal piperazine nitrogen since the K 
          i for analog 2 also increased. The
          portion of the molecule common to all three compounds,
          the aromatic benzimidazole, is thus the most likely point
          of interaction for W89.
        
        
          Functional group interactions of R91
          The R91A mutation increased the K 
          i value for lerisetron inhibition of [
          3H]granisetron binding by 7.6 fold. This is a moderately
          small change for an alanine mutation, particularly
          considering that the smallest change in K 
          i for removal of a functional group on
          lerisetron (the N-benzyl group) was 31 fold. It is
          therefore likely that this interaction is either
          extremely weak or the change in K 
          i is the result of a structural change
          in the binding site. Previous studies concluded that R91
          was an important interaction for the 5-HT 
          3 R agonist 5-hydroxytryptamine
          (5-HT), since the K 
          i for 5-HT inhibition increased over
          3000 fold as a result of the R91A mutation [ 24 ] . A
          change in K 
          d for [ 3H]granisetron binding to R91A
          was also observed. In order to determine whether the
          N-benzyl or distal piperazine nitrogen of lerisetron was
          involved in an interaction with R91, we tested both
          analog 1 and 2 on R91A mutant receptors. No change in K 
          i was observed for either compound.
          This result makes it much more difficult to assign the
          correct functional group to this amino acid since it
          suggests that one or both of the compounds is no longer
          binding the receptor in precisely the same manner as
          lerisetron. Considering the small change observed for
          lerisetron binding as a result of this mutation, even a
          slight reorientation of the molecule in the binding site
          could result in the loss of this interaction.
        
        
          Functional group interactions of Y142
          The K 
          i values for inhibition of [
          3H]granisetron binding by analogs 1 and 2 were altered
          only slightly by the Y142A mutation. The magnitude of the
          increase in K 
          i for lerisetron, however, was
          considerably larger (160 fold) and is indicative of an
          important interaction of the compound with Y142. The lack
          of a large change in K 
          i for both analogs makes it difficult
          to interpret this data since one or both of the compounds
          appears to be interacting differently with the binding
          site than lerisetron.
          Analogs 1 and 2 differ from each other both in the
          functional groups contained in the molecule and their
          structural similarity to lerisetron. Analog 2 is most
          similar in overall structure. The substitution of oxygen
          for the distal amino nitrogen alters the potential
          interactions formed at this position, but is likely to
          have a small effect on the overall size and shape of the
          molecule. Analog 1 is far less similar to lerisetron and
          more similar to the 5-HT 
          3 R antagonist granisetron. Previous
          studies have shown that the binding of granisetron is not
          affected by the Y142A mutation [ 25 ] . Analog 1 may bind
          more similar to granisetron than lerisetron and thus
          would be unaffected by mutations at Y142. This is less
          likely to be the case with analog 2.
          The strength of the putative interaction at Y142 can
          be identified by examining the change in binding of
          lerisetron as a result of the Y142A mutation. The Y142A
          mutation produced a 160 fold change in K 
          i . This change reflects the binding
          energy lost as a result of the alanine substitution. The
          observed change in Ki on wt receptors is much larger than
          that observed for removal of the N-benzyl group (31
          fold), but is similar to that observed for substitution
          of the distal amino nitrogen in analog 2 (400 fold).
          Taken together with the close structural similarity of
          analog 2 to lerisetron, it can be concluded that
          comparison of analog 2 and lerisetron should provide the
          best means of identifying the interaction at Y142. No
          change in K 
          i was observed for analog 2 as a
          result of the Y142A mutation indicating a lack of any
          significant interaction of this compound with Y142. These
          data support our hypothesis that Y142 interacts with the
          distal piperazine nitrogen of lerisetron. A second amino
          acid may also be involved since the change in K 
          i for lerisetron binding as a result
          of the Y142A mutation was smaller than the change
          produced by substitution of the piperazine nitrogen. As
          described below, one candidate for this second amino acid
          is Y152.
        
        
          Functional group interactions of Y152
          The Y152A mutation produced increases in K 
          i for all three compounds although the
          magnitude of the change differed. The increases in the K 
          i values were 190 fold for lerisetron,
          98 fold for analog 1 and only 40 fold for analog 2. Thus,
          analog 1 retains much of its ability to interact with
          Y152 despite the absence of the N-benzyl group, while
          analog 2 interacts more weakly with this amino acid.
          Since the K 
          i for analog 1 is increased by the
          Y152A mutation, it is unlikely that the N-benzyl group
          interacts with Y152. The small change in K 
          i for analog 2 supports a partial
          interaction of Y152 with the distal piperazine nitrogen
          although some interaction with another group is also
          apparent. This other group would be expected to be in
          close proximity to the distal nitrogen. The most likely
          candidate is the other nitrogen of the piperazine ring.
          Thus Y152A may form a partial interaction with both
          piperazine nitrogens.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Figure 6shows a hypothetical model of the
        lerisetron-binding site supported by our observations. The
        model illustrates the secondary structure of the region of
        the receptor from Y140 - Y152 in a loop configuration. This
        structure is supported by site-directed mutagenesis data [
        25 ] as well as structural predictions obtained from other
        LGIC receptors [ 31 ] . The recent determination of the
        structure of a nicotinic acetylcholine binding protein [ 27
        ] that shares significant homology with the LGIC family
        also supports a loop structure in this part of the protein.
        The region from W89 through Y93 is shown as a β-sheet as
        has been hypothesized based on site-directed mutagenesis
        studies of this strand of the 5-HT 
        3 R [ 24 ] . Our data indicate the
        functional groups of lerisetron that may interact with W89,
        R91, Y142 and Y152.
        W89 is shown interacting with the aromatic benzimidazole
        group of lerisetron although the precise position of W89
        relative to this group is not known. The W89 interaction
        with this group is supported by the observed increase in K 
        i for lerisetron, analog 1 and analog 2.
        Since the benzimidazole group is common to all three
        compounds it is the most likely point of interaction. W89
        also represents a common interaction in the binding site
        for both lerisetron and [3H]granisetron.
        Y142 is shown interacting with the distal piperazine
        nitrogen possibly through a cation-π interaction. This
        orientation of an amino group interacting with an aromatic
        amino acid in a cation-π interaction has been shown for the
        nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and has been hypothesized
        for many LGIC receptors [ 28 29 30 26 ] . This conclusion
        is based on both the magnitude of the change observed on
        the wild type receptor for removal of the amino group (400
        fold) compared to the effect of the Y142A mutation on
        lerisetron binding (160 fold) and the lack of any major
        change in K 
        i for analog 2 as a result of this
        mutation. Our data does not support an interaction of this
        amino acid with either the N-benzyl or benzimidazole
        portions of lerisetron.
        Y152 is shown positioned between the two piperazine
        nitrogens. This conclusion is supported by the smaller
        increase in K 
        i for analog 2 (40 fold) compared to
        that observed for lerisetron (190 fold). These results
        suggest a partial interaction of Y152 with the distal
        piperazine nitrogen. Since some change was observed, a
        second interaction is also likely. The functional group in
        closest proximity to the distal piperazine nitrogen is the
        other nitrogen on the piperazine ring. Another possibility
        would be the N-benzyl interaction, however, since the Y152A
        mutation also produced a large increase in K 
        i for analog 2, this conclusion is not
        supported by our data.
        R91 is shown as interacting with the N-benzyl group.
        This is a difficult conclusion to make considering the
        small effect of the R91A mutation on lerisetron binding.
        The interaction is included in the model based on
        structural information obtained from the crystal structure
        of AChBP [ 27 ] . The region of this protein homologous to
        loop E and loop D of the 5-HT 
        3A receptor suggests a loop structure
        from Y140 to Y152 and a 3-residue turn containing a glycine
        at position 147 and the β-strand from W89 through Y93
        oriented as shown in Figure 6. The orientation of
        lerisetron between W89 and Y142A as shown would enable the
        N-benzyl group to be positioned in close proximity to R91.
        If this is the case, then a small alteration in position of
        analog 1 or 2 in the binding site could result in the loss
        of this presumably weak interaction. The apparent
        alterations in the binding site location of analog 1 would
        be consistent with this hypothesis. An alternate hypothesis
        would place the N-benzyl group in a different position,
        interacting with another amino acid; either solely or in
        concert with R91.
        Our data support a binding site for lerisetron on the
        5-HT 
        3 R that spans the D and E loop regions.
        Table 2shows the sequence alignment for the 5-HT 
        3 R, the α7 receptor and the AChBP for
        these loops. Sequence alignment of mouse 5-HT 
        3 AR, α7 nAchR and AChBP result in
        alignment of the proposed D and E loop of the 5-HT 
        3 AR with corresponding regions of the
        α7 nAchR and AChBP. The amino acids W89, R91 Y140, Y142 and
        Y152 of the 5HT 
        3 A R can be aligned with W53, Q55,
        L102, R104, and M114 of the AChBP (Figure 6). These amino
        acids form a cluster in the proposed acetylcholine binding
        domain of AChBP similar to that proposed in our model. Both
        loops have been identified on the complementary face of the
        binding site of the nAChR. It is unknown if lerisetron
        utilizes amino acids on the principal face although none
        have been identified. The model for lerisetron binding will
        be further refined as its interactions with other binding
        site amino acids are investigated [ 26 32 33 ] . Of
        particular interest would be potential interactions of the
        N-benzyl group that would account for the decrease in
        binding affinity of analog 2. Additional information gained
        from comparison of our model with the recent crystal
        structure of the AChBP demonstrates that lerisetron can be
        roughly 'fit' into the binding site such that all the
        residues line up as shown in our model. While this is not
        direct evidence that the model is correct, subsequent
        molecular modeling of the data presented in this paper may
        provide further support for our hypothesis. Our current
        model provides an initial working hypothesis that can form
        the basis of further investigation. Also, while it is
        unclear whether the information obtained in this study can
        be extended to other 5-HT 
        3 R ligands, a similar approach would be
        useful in identifying functional group interactions for
        mCPBG, 5-HT, dtC and granisetron.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Mutagenesis
          Wild type 5-HT 
          3AS mouse receptor cDNA was derived
          from N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells as previously described
          [ 24 ] . Mutant receptors were constructed using
          polymerase chain reaction (Quick change mutagenesis kit,
          Promega). All mutations were confirmed by DNA
          sequencing.
        
        
          Cell culture methods and transfections
          tsA201 cells (a derivative of the HEK293 cell line)
          were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (D-MEM)
          containing 10% FBS and 100-units/ml
          penicillin/streptomycin. Cultures were maintained in
          humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 
          2 at 37°C. For binding studies, tsA201
          cells were plated at a density of 5 × 10 6cells/75 cm
          2and grown for 9 hours prior to transfection. Cells were
          transfected with 10 μg murine 5-HT 
          3AS R cDNA using calcium phosphate
          co-precipitation (New Life Technologies, NY), then
          incubated 36 hours prior to harvesting. For whole cell
          patch clamp experiments, tsA201 cells were plated at a
          density of 0.25 × 10 6cells/27 cm 2dish and grown 12
          hours prior to transfection. Cells were washed with fresh
          culture medium then transfected with 10 μg 5-HT 
          3AS R cDNA using Qiagen Superfect
          transfection reagent (Qiagen, CA). Transfected cells were
          incubated with this mixture for 2.5 hours, then divided
          into 35 mm culture dishes at a density of approximately 5
          × 10 4cells/dish and incubated for 24 hours at 37°C
          before recording.
        
        
          Radioligand Binding Assay
          Transfected cells were scraped from the dishes, washed
          twice with Dulbecco's PBS (New Life Technologies, NY),
          then resuspended in 1.0 ml PBS/100 mm dish. Cells were
          either used fresh or frozen at this step until needed.
          Immediately prior to use, cells were homogenized in PBS
          using a glass tissue homogenizer then centrifuged at 35
          000 × g for 30 minutes in a Beckman JA20 rotor. Membranes
          were washed once more with PBS then resuspended in 1 ml
          PBS/100 mm dish. Protein content was determined using a
          Lowry assay (Sigma. Diagnostics, St. Louis, MO). Binding
          assays were performed in PBS. For K 
          d determinations, 100 μl of homogenate
          was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour with varying
          concentrations of [ 3H] granisetron (NEN, MA). Specific
          binding of [ 3H] granisetron was determined as the bound
          [ 3H] granisetron not displaced by a saturating
          concentration of a competing ligand (100 μM mCPBG or 10
          μM MDL-72222). K 
          d values were determined by fitting
          the binding data to the following equation using GraphPad
          PRISM (San Diego CA): B = Bmax [L] n / ([L] n + Kn),
          where θ is bound ligand, Bmax is the maximum binding at
          equilibrium L is the free ligand concentration and n is
          the Hill coefficient. For K 
          i determinations, 100 μl of homogenate
          was incubated at 37°C for 2 hours with varying
          concentrations of inhibitor and [ 3H] granisetron (NEN,
          MA). Binding was terminated by rapid filtration onto a
          GF/B filters. The IC 
          50 values were calculated by fitting
          the data to the following equation using GraphPad PRISM
          (San Diego CA): θ = 1/ (1+(L/IC 
          50 )), where θ is the fractional
          amount of [ 3H] granisetron bound in the presence of
          inhibitor at concentration L as compared to the amount of
          [ 3H] granisetron bound in the absence of inhibitor. IC 
          50 is the concentration at which θ =
          0.5. The K 
          i is calculated from the IC 
          50 value using the Cheng-Prusoff
          equation.
        
        
          Electrophysiological Methods
          Transfected tsA201 cells were transferred to a
          recording chamber and submerged in extracellular
          recording buffer containing 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 140 mM
          NaCl, 1.7 mM MgCl 
          2 , 5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl 
          2 . Patch electrodes (2-2.5 MΩ) were
          filled with intracellular recording buffer containing 25
          mM HEPES pH 7.4, 145 mM KCL, 2 mM MgCl 
          2 and 1 mM EGTA. Cells were clamped in
          whole cell configuration at a holding potential of -60
          mV. Currents elicited by agonist application were
          measured using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Foster City,
          CA) under computer control (DataPac 2000, RUN
          Technologies). Agonists and antagonists were dissolved in
          extracellular solution and delivered to cells using a
          rapid perfusion system (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT).
          For EC 
          50 determinations, responses were
          normalized to the maximum response obtained from the full
          agonist 5-HT and fitted to the equation Ψ= 1/1+(EC50/ [C]
          n), where Ψ is the normalized current at 5-HT
          concentration [C], EC50 is the concentration of 5-HT
          needed to obtain half maximal activation and n is the
          apparent Hill coefficient. For inhibition experiments,
          cells were exposed to inhibitor alone for 30 s prior to
          co-exposure with 5-HT. Inhibited responses were
          calculated as a fraction of the response to 5-HT alone.
          Data were plotted as the fractional response versus the
          concentration of inhibitor and analysed using GraphPad
          software. The IC 
          50 value was calculated as the
          concentration of antagonist inhibiting the 5-HT evoked
          response by 50%. A K 
          i value was calculated from the IC 
          50 using the Cheng-Prusoff
          equation.
        
        
          Synthesis of Lerisetron and its analogs
          All target molecules were prepared according to a
          general 2-step synthesis reported previously by Orjales 
          et al . with only slight
          modification [ 22 23 ] . Commercially available
          2-chlorobenzimidazole, in dry DMF was treated with a
          slight excess of NaH, (1.1eq). After stirring for 1 hour
          at room temperature, one equivalent of the appropriate
          alkyl bromide was added slowly and the reaction mixture
          heated under reflux for > 5 hours (the reaction was
          monitored by TLC). Reaction product was partitioned
          between water and methylene chloride; organic layer was
          dried (Na 
          2 SO 
          4 ) and concentrated in vacuum. The
          solid residue was purified by Flash chromatography, which
          afforded the corresponding N-substituted
          2-Chlorobenzimidazole intermediates in good yield. The
          final step involved a nucleophilic substitution of the
          2-chloro group by piperazine at high temperatures. The
          reaction was performed neat using 4-10 fold excess
          piperazine and typically heated for a short period only,
          (30-45 min). Similar work-up afforded a residue that was
          purified by either crystallization or chromatography. The
          yields ranged from 40-95%. All compounds were
          characterized by NMR, MS, HRMS, and /or elemental
          analysis or were identical to literature reports.

          and Trypsin were obtained from New Life Technologies.
          5-HT and MDL-72222 were obtained from RBI. [
          3H]-granisetron (84 Ci/mmol) was purchased from New
