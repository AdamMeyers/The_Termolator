        Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse
        transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) is a product of the gag-pol
        polyprotein precursor, which is subsequently cleaved by the
        
        pol -encoded protease to yield the
        active form of the enzyme [ 1 2 ] . This multifunctional
        enzyme is responsible for copying the single stranded viral
        RNA genome into double stranded proviral DNA [ 3 4 ] .
        HIV-1 RT is a heterodimer consisting of a 66 and 51 kDa
        polypeptide chain designated as p66 and p51, respectively.
        The p51 subunit is generated via endoproteolytic cleavage
        of the p66 subunit between Phe 440 and Tyr 441 [ 5 6 ] .
        The larger subunit (p66) contains both polymerase and RNase
        H activities, while the smaller subunit (p51) lacks these
        functions, in context of the heterodimer [ 7 8 ] . However,
        both the p66 and p51 monomers are functionally inactive
        when dissociated from each other [ 9 ] . Several years have
        passed since it was first suggested that agents that could
        specifically disrupt the dimerization of HIV-1 RT might
        prove a worthwhile antiretroviral strategy [ 10 ] , though
        such agents have yet to be developed.
        Despite the fact that p51 shares an identical amino acid
        sequence with the N-terminal portion of p66, the two
        subunits assume different global folding patterns in the
        formation of the asymmetric heterodimer [ 9 ] . Structural
        determination through X-ray crystallography has revealed
        that the p66 subunit of HIV-1RT has its polymerase domain
        in an "open" conformation, with its subdomains forming a
        large cleft which accommodates DNA. In contrast, the p51
        subunit assumes a compact folded conformation that causes
        the active site residues in this subunit to be buried and
        therefore, nonfunctional [ 11 12 13 ] . It has been
        proposed that the open conformation of p66 is supported by
        interactions with a closed and compact p51 molecule [ 12 14
        15 ] . The two subunits interact mainly via their
        connection subdomains. Additional contacts, between the
        thumb subdomain of p51 and RNase H subdomain of p66 are
        also substantial [ 11 12 ] .
        Although there have been conflicting reports regarding
        the DNA polymerase activity of recombinant preparations of
        the p51 homodimer [ 16 17 ] , it has become clear that p51
        mainly plays a supportive role in context of the p66/p51
        heterodimer. Assembly of chimeric heterodimers formed by
        mixing subunits of HIV-1 RT and FIV-1 RT, has demonstrated
        that the p51 subunit of HIV-1 RT helps to preserve the
        functional integrity of the HIV-1 RT heterodimer [ 18 ] .
        Despite the fact that several functions have been proposed
        for the p51 subunit, the mechanism whereby p51 performs
        these functions has remained largely undefined. Some of the
        proposed functions for p51 include: (i) stabilizing the
        t-RNA primer binding for the initiation of reverse
        transcription [ 11 ] , (ii) enhancement of strand
        displacement DNA synthesis [ 19 20 ] , and (iii) as a
        processivity factor in DNA synthesis [ 21 ] .
        Cys→Ser mutation at position 280 in the p51 subunit has
        been shown to alter the RNase H activity of the
        heterodimeric enzyme, indicating that this residue in the
        thumb subdomain of p51 plays an important role in support
        of the RNase H activity of p66 [ 22 ] . The emergence of a
        strain of HIV-1 resistant to the non-nucleoside RT
        inhibitor TSAO (Tertbutyldimethyl silyspiro amino
        oxathioledioside) displaying Glu→Lys mutation at position
        138 in the p51 subunit of HIV-1 RT has also been reported [
        23 ] , thus implicating p51 to play a more direct role in
        drug binding and/or the enzymatic activities of HIV-1RT.
        This report was initially surprising, since Glu138 of p51
        was thought to be quite distant from the purported
        dNTP-binding pocket of HIV-1RT, as well as the NNRTI
        binding pocket. However, in light of our recent findings
        implicating this loop region of p51 as a critical
        structural element supporting the catalytic functions of
        p66, it seems feasible that mutation at position 138 in p51
        effectively altered the binding of TSAO through its
        influence on the p66 catalytic subunit [ 14 ] .
        Examination of the crystal structure of HIV-1 RT reveals
        the presence of a small groove like region on the floor of
        the polymerase cleft of p66 [ 11 ] . The β7-β8 loop of p51,
        comprising of six amino acids denoted as SINNET appears to
        fit into this groove-like region and likely stabilizes the
        polymerase domain of p66. In an earlier communication, we
        have shown that the p51 subunit of HIV-1 RT is required to
        load the p66 subunit on to the template primer for DNA
        synthesis [ 14 ] . Our recent studies indicate that the
        β7-β8 loop of the p51 subunit is essential for the
        catalytic function of the p66 subunit. Deletion of this
        loop or substitution of four amino acid residues with
        alanine within the β7-β8 loop of p51 severely impaired the
        DNA polymerase activity of the enzyme as a consequence of
        the inability of the enzyme to form stable dimers [ 15 ] .
        These findings clearly establish the absolute requirement
        of the β7-β8 loop of p51 for RT dimerization.
        Nonetheless, the question regarding the optimal size and
        composition requirement of this loop for efficient
        dimerization remains unanswered. In the present article, we
        have addressed the impact of increasing the size of the
        β7-β8 loop on the dimerization process. As a preamble to
        these studies, we have increased the size of this loop by
        repeating its six amino acid sequence in tandem. The
        rationale for duplicating the loop sequence was to increase
        the size of this loop without significantly disrupting the
        interactions seen with the wild type β7-β8 loop. The
        resulting mutant derivatives of HIV-1 RT containing
        insertion of six amino acids in the β7-β8 loop in either or
        both the subunits were analyzed for their ability to form
        stable dimers and other biochemical characteristics. In
        this article, we present evidence that HIV-1 RT mutants,
        carrying insertion of six amino acids in the β7-β8 loop
        specifically in the second subunit, do not form stable
        dimers. This inability to dimerize substantially decreases
        the enzymes affinity for DNA consequently impairing its
        polymerase and RNase H activities.
      
      
        Results
        
          Glycerol gradient ultra-centrifugation
          analysis
          The ability of the HIV-1 RT mutants, carrying
          insertion of six residues in the β7-β8 loop in either one
          or both the subunits was analyzed by glycerol gradient
          sedimentation analysis. Fractions of 200 μL were
          collected from the bottom of the tube and aliquots of
          every third fraction were subjected to SDS PAGE. The
          results shown in Figure 1A, indicate that the
          sedimentation peak for the wild type p66/p66 homodimer
          was between fractions 16-19 of the gradient (Panel A),
          whereas the wild type p51 species sedimented between
          fractions 22-28, as a monomeric protein (Panel C). The
          sedimentation pattern for the p66 WT/p51 INSmutant
          indicated two distinct peaks. While the p66 WTsubunit
          predominantly sedimented in between fractions 16-19, at
          the predicted position of the homodimer, the p51
          INSsubunit sedimented between fractions 22-28, indicating
          a monomeric conformation (Panel D). This sedimentation
          profile indicates that the p66 WT/p51 INSmutant carrying
          the 6 amino acid insertion in the β7-β8 loop of its p51
          subunit is unable to form stable heterodimer. Under these
          conditions, the p66 WTsubunit of the p66 WT/p51 INSmutant
          tends to homodimerize. The mutants, p66 INS/p66 INS(Panel
          B) and p66 INS/p51 INS(Panel F), exhibited a distinct
          sedimentation peak between fractions 22-28 of the
          gradient, indicating that these enzymes are unable to
          form stable dimers. In contrast, the p66 INS/p51 WTmutant
          (Panel E), in which only the p66 subunit carried an
          insertion in the β7-β8 loop sedimented between fractions
          16-19 of the gradient, indicating that these two subunits
          can form stable heterodimers. These analyses imply that
          the proper size of the β7-β8 loop in the second subunit
          of HIV-1 RT is important for the formation of a stable
          dimeric enzyme.
          In order to correlate the sedimentation profile of
          these insertion mutants with their functional activity,
          we analyzed the polymerase activity in the various
          gradient fractions. These results are presented in Fig.
          1B. The polymerase activity profile of the gradient
          fractions of the wild-type p66/p66 and the p66 INS/p51
          WTmutant revealed major polymerase activity peaks
          corresponding to fractions 16-19 (Fig. 1B). This activity
          peak correlates with the protein band intensity seen in
          Fig. 1A(panels A and E) and is also in agreement with the
          sedimentation pattern of these two enzymes.
          Interestingly, the activity profile of the p66 WT/p51
          INSmutant also yielded a peak corresponding to gradient
          fractions 16-19 (Fig. 1B), thus substantiating our
          contention that the p66 WTsubunit of the p66 WT/p51
          INSmutant tends to self-dimerize and form the
          catalytically active p66 homodimer. The wild type p51 and
          the two mutants, p66 INS/p66 INSand p66 INS/p51 INS, the
          sedimentation profile of which indicated a monomeric
          conformation (Fig. 1A) were conspicuously devoid of any
          polymerase activity (Fig. 1B). These results imply that
          the β7-β8 loop of the second subunit of HIV-1 RT is
          critical in forming functionally active dimeric
          enzyme.
        
        
          DNA polymerase activities of wild type HIV-1 RT and
          its insertion mutants
          DNA polymerase activity of the wild type HIV-1 RT and
          its mutant derivatives were quantitatively determined on
          both heteropolymeric RNA (U5-PBS RNA) and DNA (49-mer)
          templates, primed with 32P labeled 17-mer PBS primer. As
          documented in Table 1, insertion of the six amino acid
          segment in both the subunits (p66 INS/p66 INSor p66
          INS/p51 INS), resulted in significant loss of polymerase
          activity corresponding to greater than 90% reduction.
          Interestingly, when the p66 INSmutant was dimerized with
          the wild type p51 (p66 INS/p51 WT), the polymerase
          activity was restored to wild type levels. The same
          result was obtained when p66 INSwas dimerized with p51
          having Asp→Ala mutation at amino acid position 186 (one
          of the catalytically crucial carboxylate triad) but
          having an intact β7-β8 loop. The rationale for using p51
          D186Amutant was to ascertain that the wild type
          polymerase activity observed with p66 INS/p51 WTwas not
          due to residual polymerase activity of p51. These results
          suggest that insertion of six residues in the β7-β8 loop
          of p51 but not in p66 is detrimental to the function of
          the heterodimeric enzyme.
          As shown in figure 2, evaluation of the polymerase
          activity of the wild type HIV-1RT and its insertion
          mutants by primer extension assay generally mirrored the
          results observed in the TCA precipitation assay,
          summarized in Table 1. Insertion of six amino acid
          residues in the β7-β8 loops of both the subunits (p66
          INS/p66 INSor p66 INS/p51 INS) resulted in significant
          impairment of polymerase activity of the mutant enzymes.
          On an RNA template, both these enzymes exhibited total
          lack of polymerase activity (Fig. 2B), though the p66
          INS/p51 INSmutant exhibited residual primer extension
          capability on a DNA template (Fig. 2A), while the p66
          INSp/66 INSmutant was inactive on this template.
          Consistent with the results of the TCA precipitation
          assay, both the mutants, p66 INS/p51 WTand p66 INS/p51
          D186A, exhibited near wild type (p66 WT/p51 WT)
          polymerase activity on both RNA and DNA templates. Thus,
          the impairment of the polymerase activity seen with these
          mutants carrying insertion in either both the subunits or
          specifically in the second subunit may be related to the
          inability of these mutants to form stable dimers
          resulting in a closed polymerase cleft.
        
        
          Effect of insertion in either or both the subunits
          of HIV-1 RT on the DNA binding function of the
          enzyme
          Earlier we have shown that substitution of four amino
          acids on the β7-β8 loop with alanine reduced the DNA
          binding ability of the enzyme. Similar results were
          obtained when four amino acids were deleted from the
          loop. We therefore, concluded that the effect was exerted
          via p51 since alanine substitution or deletion
          specifically in the p66 subunit had no effect on DNA
          binding and polymerase activity of the enzyme. We
          speculated that alanine substitution or deletion in the
          loop of the p51 subunit may shorten the interacting
          sphere of the loop which may not be able to induce
          opening of the polymerase cleft in p66, which is
          essential for DNA binding. Given the fact that shortening
          of this loop in p51 prevented DNA binding, we were
          interested in examining the effect of six amino acids
          insertion on DNA binding. Therefore, we determined the
          equilibrium dissociation constants (K 
          d ) of E-TP binary complexes for the
          wild type enzyme and its mutant derivatives by gel
          mobility shift assay. For this purpose, we used a 33-mer
          heteropolymeric DNA template primed with 5' 32P-labeled
          21-mer DNA. Results shown in figure 3and table 2indicate
          a 24-fold reduction in DNA binding affinity when both the
          subunits carried insertion (p66 INS/p51 INS) in their
          β7-β8 loops. Similar results were obtained with the p66
          INS/p66 INSmutant. Interestingly, the DNA binding
          affinity was restored to the wild type levels, when the
          mutant p66 subunit was dimerized with the wild type p51
          (p66 INS/p51 WT). We expected that the p66 WT/p51
          INSmutant would also exhibit reduction in its affinity
          for DNA, since insertion of six residues in the p51
          subunit was speculated to be detrimental for the
          dimerization process. However, the DNA binding affinity
          of the p66 WT/p51 INSmutant was similar to the wild type
          enzyme. Our glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis had
          revealed that the p66 WT/p51 INSmutant does not form
          stable dimers, rather the p66 WTsubunit tends to self
          dimerize. Thus, the wild type DNA binding affinity seen
          in case of the p66 WT/p51 INSmutant may be attributed to
          the presence of these p66 WT/p66 WThomodimeric species.
          Based on our observations from the sedimentation
          analysis, we propose that the loss of DNA binding
          function in case of the HIV-1RT insertion mutants results
          from a failure to form stable dimers. The wild type p51
          alone exhibited very low DNA binding affinity with a K 
          d[DNA] 1300-fold higher than the wild
          type heterodimeric enzyme. These results suggest that the
          optimal size of the β7-β8 loop in the second subunit of
          the HIV-1 RT dimer is crucial for opening the polymerase
          cleft of the p66 subunit.
        
        
          Ternary complex formation by the wild type and
          mutant enzymes
          In the crystal structures of the ternary complex of
          HIV-1 RT (E-DNA-dNTP) the finger subdomain moves by 20Å
          towards the palm subdomain [ 24 ] . In this finger
          closing conformation, the DNA is locked in a stable
          ternary complex poised for catalysis. An 
          in vitro assay using dideoxy
          terminated primer annealed with the template which allows
          the next correct dNTP to bind in the ternary complex
          without actual DNA synthesis has recently been reported [
          25 ] . Using this assay system, we have evaluated the
          ability of the insertion mutants to form the ternary
          complexes and the effect of DNA trap on such complexes.
          Since binding of dNTP to the enzyme is an ordered
          mechanism which occurs only after DNA binding, the extent
          of labeled TP remaining bound to the enzyme in the
          presence of dNTP and DNA trap represents the extent of
          ternary complex formed. The E-TP binary complex was
          formed at enzyme concentrations which binds 100% of the
          labeled template primer. The preformed E-TP complex was
          then incubated in the presence of next correct dNTP
          followed by addition of 300-fold molar excess of
          unlabeled TP as the DNA trap. We found that E-TP binary
          complex was completely competed out by the DNA trap (data
          not shown) while a significant amount of the E-TP binary
          complex converted to E-TP-dNTP ternary complex was
          resistant to competition with DNA trap (Fig. 4)
          suggesting the stability of the ternary complex. Table
          2lists the apparent dNTP binding affinity for the WT
          enzyme and its insertion mutants determined from data
          shown in Fig. 4. It was observed that although the DNA
          binding affinity was severely affected in case of the p66
          INS/p51 INSmutant, its apparent dNTP binding affinity in
          the ternary complex did not change with respect to the
          wild type enzyme. However, the p66 INS/p66 INSmutant was
          unable to form a ternary complex. These data suggest that
          these two mutants may have a different conformation and
          mode of interaction in the ternary complex. It is
          apparent that the p66 INS/p66 INSbinds to TP in a
          nonproductive manner which may have a direct impact on
          dNTP binding in the ternary complex.
        
        
          Steady state kinetic analysis of HIV-1 RT and its
          insertion mutants
          In order to determine whether alteration in DNA
          binding without any change in the apparent dNTP binding
          affinity of the insertion mutants is consistent with
          their kinetic parameters, we analyzed the steady-state
          kinetic parameters of these mutants. The results of this
          investigation are summarized in Table 3. On poly
          (rA).(dT) 
          18 , only the p66 INS/p66 INSmutant
          showed a significant increase in K 
          m [dNTP] . This observation is in
          agreement with the apparent dNTP binding affinity data in
          the ternary complex, where p66 INS/p66 INSmutant was
          found to be defective in forming a productive ternary
          complex. This observation is also consistent with our
          suggestion that p66 INS/p66 INSbinds nonproductively to
          TP that may influence the formation of ternary complexes.
          Interestingly, the p66 INS/p51 INSmutant carrying
          insertion in both the subunits did not display the same
          reduction in dTTP binding affinity. However, the p66
          INS/p66 INSand p66 INS/p51 INSmutants displayed nearly
          6,000-fold and 400-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency
          (k 
          cat /Km) compared to their wild type
          counterparts, respectively, on this template primer. A
          10-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency in case of the
          p66 INS/p51 WTwas noted only on poly (rA). (dT) 
          18 and may be template-primer
          specific. None of the enzymes displayed a significant
          reduction in K 
          m [dNTP] when the heteropolymeric
          DNA\DNA template primer was used, although the p66
          INS/p66 INSand p66 INS/p51 INSmutants exhibited drastic
          reduction in catalytic efficiency. The p66 WT/p51
          INSdisplayed no change in either dNTP binding or
          catalytic efficiency. These results are in keeping with
          our analysis of the polymerase and DNA binding assay for
          this mutant. Once again, we believe that the wild type
          p66 subunit in this enzyme preparation tends to
          homodimerize since the p51 INSfails to participate in
          stable dimer formation. This phenomenon masks the
          deleterious effect of the insertion mutation.
        
        
          RNase H activity of the insertion mutants
          Since the polymerase activity of the homo- and
          hetero-dimeric enzymes carrying insertion in the β7-β8
          loop in both the subunits (p66 INS/p66 INSand p66 INS/p51
          INS) was drastically impaired, it was of interest to
          examine how this insertion affects their RNase H
          activity. To evaluate this, we employed a 30-mer RNA-DNA
          hybrid, and examined the cleavage of the 5'- 32P-RNA
          strand of the duplex by the wild type enzyme and its
          mutant derivatives. The result of this analysis is
          presented in Fig. 5. Similar to their polymerase
          activities, the RNase H activities of the p66 INS/p66
          INSand p66 INS/p51 INSmutants were severely impaired.
          This is not surprising, since our analysis of the DNA
          binding function of these two mutants had indicated a
          substantial loss of DNA binding affinity, which in turn
          is expected to affect both the polymerase and RNase H
          functions. Dimerization of the p66 INSsubunit with the
          wild type p51 (p66 INS/p51 WT) carrying an intact β7-β8
          loop resulted in substantial recovery of the RNase H
          activity. The RNase H activity seen in case of the p66
          WT/p51 INSmutant was not surprising since the p66
          WTsubunit of the p66 WT/p51 INSmutant tends to
          self-dimerize and form the catalytically active p66
          homodimer.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In an earlier investigation on the role of the p51
        subunit of HIV-1 RT, we demonstrated that decrease in size
        of its β7-β8 loop impairs the catalytic function of the
        heterodimer [ 15 ] . In the present studies, we demonstrate
        that maintaining the wild type size of this loop in the p51
        subunit is critical for dimerization of the enzyme and its
        catalytic activity. Duplication of the β7-β8 loop sequence
        selectively in the p66 subunit did not affect the dimer
        formation, DNA binding or polymerase activity of the p66
        INS/p51 WTmutant. However, insertion of the same amino acid
        residues in the β7-β8 loop of p51 prevented stable
        dimerization of the p51 INSsubunit with either p66 INSor
        p66 WTand adversely impacted the DNA binding, polymerase
        and RNase H activities. Earlier, we have shown that p51
        facilitates the loading of the p66 subunit on to the
        template primer [ 14 ] . Therefore, the impaired polymerase
        activity and template-primer binding affinity of HIV-1 RT
        mutants carrying insertion in p51 may be due to their
        inability to load the catalytic p66 (p66 INS) on the
        template primer. These altered biophysical/enzymatic
        properties of these insertion mutants may be attributed to
        the reduced dimer stability.
        Crystal structures of HIV-1 RT show that p66 and p51
        assume different folding patterns and tertiary structures [
        11 12 ] . It has been proposed that p66 in a monomeric form
        exists in a closed conformation similar to p51 [ 26 ] .
        Following dimerization with another molecule of p51 (or
        p66), it assumes an open conformation [ 11 14 15 ] . The
        polymerase domain of p51 is buried within its core. This
        difference in tertiary structures between the two subunits
        makes the dimer asymmetric. The amino acid residues at the
        contact interface differ with respect to their position and
        location in the 3-D structure. The counterpart of amino
        acid residues of p66 located at the contact interface are
        buried in the p51 folded conformation, whereas those of p51
        are scattered in the p66 'open' conformation (Fig. 6).
        Of the several domain interactions between p66 and p51,
        the β7-β8 loop of p51 is strategically positioned to
        interact with the residues on the floor of the palm
        subdomain of p66. It has been suggested that the stability
        of the dimer is related to the buried surface area between
        the two subunits [ 11 12 ] . In the nevirapine-bound HIV-1
        RT crystal structure, the total contact surface area
        between the subunits is approximately ~4600 Å 2. The two
        major contact regions between the subunits which provide it
        stability are their connection subdomains and the thumb of
        p51 and RNase H domain of p66. These contacts account for
        approximately two third of the total buried surface area.
        Interestingly, the marginal decrease in the total surface
        area due to deletion of four residues in the β7-β8 loop
        does not account for the dimer instability, thus suggesting
        that polar interactions of residues in the β7-β8 loop of
        p51 with the palm subdomain of p66 may play a role in
        conferring stability to the heterodimer. The observation
        that a single point mutation at L289 of p66, a residue not
        in direct contact with p51, also destabilizes the dimer [
        27 28 ] indicates that other factors may also contribute
        towards dimer stability.
        In order to analyze the impact of inserting the six
        amino acid peptide in the β7-β8 loop of p51, we used the
        molecular modeling approach. A search in the database of
        known protein structures employing the 'loop-search'
        algorithm of SYBYL yielded 100 loops, of which only five
        were sterically permissible. The loop exhibiting the best
        homology was incorporated in the modeled structure (Fig.
        7). This loop of 9 amino acids (RFNAHGDVN) from the protein
        S. lectin formed a short anti-parallel two strand β-sheet.
        This inserted loop lies in the vicinity of the palm
        subdomain of p66 and exhibits additional hydrophobic and
        polar interactions with residues in the palm subdomain of
        p66, not seen in the wild type structure. These additional
        interactions are expected to enhance the stability of the
        dimer. However, sedimentation analysis indicates that the
        insertion mutants form unstable dimer. This implies that
        the insertion may have altered the relative position of the
        subdomains in the two subunits thereby perturbing the dimer
        stability. In summary, the β7-β8 loop of p51 is an
        important structural element involved in imparting
        stability to the heterodimer and in opening the polymerase
        cleft of p66 for catalysis.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Plasmid and clones
          The expression vector pET-28a and 
          E. coli expression strain BL21
          (DE3) were obtained from Novagen. The HIV-1RT expression
          clones (pKK223-3 RT66 and pET-28a-RT51) constructed in
          this laboratory [ 29 30 31 ] were used for PCR
          amplification and construction of the insertion mutants
          in the p66 and p51 subunits of HIV-1 RT. An HIV-RNA
          expression clone pHIV-PBS was a generous gift from Dr. M.
          A. Wainberg [ 32 ] .
        
        
          Insertion of 6 amino acid residues in the β7-β8
          loop
          The pKK-RT66 clone containing two unique restriction
          sites, 
          Hpa1 and 
          Stu1 , at codons 136 and 140 in the
          RT coding region [ 15 ] was used for insertion of 6
          amino-acid residues in the β7-β8 loop of the p66 and p51
          subunit. The pKK-RT66 clone was digested with 
          HpaI restriction enzyme to generate
          a blunt end at codon 136. For insertion, two
          complementary pre-kinased 18-mer synthetic DNA oligos
          having the following sequences: 5'-ATA AAC AAT GAG ACA
          ATA-3 (sense strand) and 3'-TAT TTG TTA CTC TGT TAT-5'
          (antisense strand) were hybridized. The 18-mer duplex DNA
          encoding the insertion peptide (Ile-Asn-Asn-Glu-Thr-Ile)
          was ligated with 
          Hpa1 digested pKK-RT66 in between
          codon 135 and 136. The positive clones were screened in 
          E. coli HB101 by the absence of an 
          Hpa1 site and the correct
          orientation of the insertion was confirmed by DNA
          sequencing. This construct expresses the p66+6aa subunit
          without His tag sequences. A His-tag at the N-terminal of
          the p66+6aa subunit was introduced by sub cloning the 
          Bal-I and 
          Hind III fragment of pKKRT66+6aa
          into pET-28a-RT66 expression cassette. A unique 
          Sac I site was also introduced in
          pKK-RT66 template at codon 440. The construction of
          P51+6aa was carried out by removal of the 360 bp fragment
          from pKK-RT66+6aa by restriction digestion with 
          SacI followed by re-ligation of the
          vector ends. The insertion mutant in pET28a and pKK223-3
          vectors were introduced into 
          E. coli BL-21 (DE3) pLys S and 
          E. coli JM109, respectively, for
          expression. Induction of the enzyme protein was carried
          out as described before for the wild type HIV-1RT [ 29 ]
          . The enzyme with the hexahistidine-tag was purified from
          bacterial lysates by immobilized metal affinity
          chromatography [ 33 ] , while non-hexahistidine-tagged
          enzyme was purified using the phosphocellulose and
          Q-Sepharose columns as described previously [ 24 ] .
        
        
          Preparation of the heterodimeric enzyme with
          subunit specific insertion
          The p51 subunit with a hexahistidine-tag and a
          non-tagged p66 were used to generate the heterodimers
          containing insertion in either or both of the subunits.
          For each set of heterodimers, 260 μg of p51 was mixed
          with 660 μg of p66 in the buffer containing 50 mM Tris
          HCl, pH 7.8, 60 mM KCl and 5 mM MgCl 
          2 . The rationale for using a 1:3
          ratio of p51 to p66 was to saturate the His-tagged p51
          with the non-tagged p66, ensuring heterodimer formation
          and eliminating excess p66 during IMAC purification. The
          mixture was incubated for 16 hours at 4°C and applied to
          (0.5 mL) Ni 2+iminodiacetic-Sepharose (IDA-Sepharose)
          column, which was pre-equilibrated with the binding
          buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCl and 5 mM
          Imidazole). The column was washed with 15 mL of the same
          buffer to remove the excess of p66 that was not dimerized
          with p51 bound to the IDA-sepharose column. The
          heterodimeric RT was then eluted from the column with
          elution buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCl and
          250 mM imidazole). Fractions of 0.5 mL were collected and
          an aliquot of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE
          using Coomassie Blue stain. The fractions containing
          approximately equal band intensity of p66 and p51 were
          dialyzed against a storage buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.0,
          200 mM NaCl and 50% Glycerol) and this enzyme preparation
          was used in all experiments.
        
        
          Glycerol gradient ultra centrifugation
          Fifty micrograms of the enzyme protein in 100 μL of
          buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mM DTT and 400 mM NaCl)
          was carefully loaded onto 5 mL of 10-30% glycerol
          gradients prepared in the same buffer. The gradients were
          centrifuged at 48,000 rpm in an SW48 rotor for 22 h at
          4°C. Fractions (200 μL) were collected from the bottom of
          the tube and aliquots of these fractions were
          electrophoresed using SDS PAGE and Coomassie Blue stain
          to identify the protein peak.
          The polymerase activity in the gradient fractions were
          analyzed by extension of the labeled (dT) 
          18 annealed to poly (rA) template.
          Every third fraction between 7 and 33 of the glycerol
          gradient was diluted 10-fold and analyzed for its
          polymerase activity. Reactions were carried out at 37°C
          for 2 min at 20 μM dTTP concentration and quenched with
          Sanger's gel loading dye [ 35 ] . The reaction products
          were resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gel
          electrophoresis and analyzed on a PhosphorImager
          (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.).
        
        
          DNA polymerase assay
          Polymerase activity of the HIV-1RT WT and insertion
          mutant enzymes was determined using two different
          template-primers: U-5PBS HIV-1 RNA and synthetic 49-mer
          U5-PBS DNA templates primed with the 17-mer PBS primer [
          36 ] . Assays were carried out in a 50 μL volume
          containing 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.8, 100 μg/mL bovine serum
          albumin, 5 mM MgCl 
          2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol, 60 mM KCl,
          100 nM template-primer, 50 μM of each of the four dNTPs
          with one of them being 32P-labeled (0.1 μCi/nmol dNTP)
          and 21 nM enzyme. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 3
          min and terminated by the addition of ice-cold 5%
          trichloroacetic acid containing 5 mM inorganic
          pyrophosphate. Following termination, the reaction
          mixtures were filtered on Whatman GF/B filters. The
          filters were then dried, immersed in scintillation fluid
          and counted in a liquid scintillation counter.
        
        
          Gel analysis of RNA and DNA dependent polymerase
          activities
          The U5-PBS HIV-1 RNA and heteropolymeric synthetic
          U5-PBS HIV-1 DNA templates primed with the 17-mer PBS DNA
          primer were used to assess the polymerase activities of
          the wild type and mutant heterodimeric enzymes. The
          primers were 5'-labeled using γ- 32P-ATP and T4
          polynucleotide kinase according to the standard protocol
          [ 37 ] . Polymerase reactions were carried out by
          incubating 2.5 nM template primer with 50 nM of the wild
          type HIV-1RT or its mutant derivative in a total reaction
          volume of 6 μL containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM
          dithiothreitol, 100 μg/mL bovine serum albumin, 5 mM MgCl
          
          2 and 50 μM of each dNTP. Reactions
          were initiated by the addition of enzyme and terminated
          by the addition of an equal volume (6 μL) of Sanger's gel
          loading dye [ 35 ] . The reaction products were resolved
          by denaturing poly acrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis
          and analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics,
          Inc.).
        
        
          Template-Primer (TP) binding affinity of the wild
          type enzyme and its mutant derivatives
          The dissociation constants (K 
          d ) of the E-TP binary complexes of
          the wild type HIV-1 RT and its mutant derivatives were
          determined as described by Tong et al. [ 25 ] . The
          heteropolymeric 33-mer DNA (0.4 nM) annealed to 5'-
          32P-labeled 21-mer primer (0.3 nM) was incubated with
          varying concentrations of the wild type enzyme and its
          mutant derivatives in a total volume of 10 μL containing
          50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl 
          2 and 0.01 % BSA. Following incubation
          of the mixture for 10 min at 4°C, equal volume of 2×
          gel-loading dye containing 0.25% bromophenol blue and 20%
          glycerol was added. The E-TP binary complexes formed were
          resolved at 4°C on 6% native polyacrylamide gel using
          Tris-Borate buffer (85 mM Tris, 85 mM Boric acid, pH
          8.0). The amounts of the TP in the binary complex (E-TP)
          and in free form with respect to the varying
          concentrations of the enzyme protein were determined by
          PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Pharmacia) analysis
          of the gel. The fraction of the bound DNA was plotted
          against enzyme concentration and the K 
          d [DNA] value was determined as the RT
          concentration at which 50% of DNA is bound.
        
        
          Ternary complex formation assay
          The ternary complex (E-DNA-dNTP) formation was
          assessed by incubating the binary complexes of enzyme and
          dideoxy terminated template primer in the presence of
          next correct dNTP [ 25 ] . The binary complexes were
          formed by incubating 10-50 nM of the wild type enzyme or
          its mutant derivatives with 0.3 nM of 5'- 32P-labeled
          dideoxy terminated 33-mer/21-mer template-primer as
          described above. The chosen concentration of enzyme was
          such that resulted in almost complete shift during E-TP
          complex formation. The E-TP-dNTP ternary complex
          formation was assessed by the addition of dNTP
          complementary to the next template base (in this case
          dGTP, 200 μM). Following incubation with dNTP at 4°C for
          10 min, 300 fold molar excess of a DNA trap was added to
          the incubation mixture to assess the stability of the
          binary and ternary complexes formed by the enzyme. The
          complexes were resolved on a 6% native polyacrylamide
          followed by phosphorImaging. The extent of E-TP-dNTP
          ternary complexes formed was quantified using ImageQuant
          software.
        
        
          RNase H activity assay
          We used a 5'- 32P labeled 30-mer synthetic U5-PBS RNA
          template annealed with a complementary 30-mer DNA to
          determine the RNase H activity of the enzymes [ 31 ] .
          The reaction mixture contained labeled RNA-DNA hybrid (10
          K Cerenkov cpm), 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 60 mM KCl, 10 mM
          dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mM MgCl
          
          2 , and 20 ng of enzyme in a final
          volume of 5 μl. Reactions were carried out at 37°C for 30
          sec and 1 min and terminated by the addition of equal
          volume of Sanger's gel loading dye [ 35 ] . The cleavage
          products were analyzed on an 8% denaturing
          polyacrylamide-urea gel and scanned on a phosphorImager
          (Molecular Dynamics Inc.).
