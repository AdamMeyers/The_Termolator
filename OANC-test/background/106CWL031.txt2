      Three a.m. is a rough time to be needing a ride to the hospital...
      Some jobs nobody wants:
      (Name) has cancer, and driving him to the hospital in ___ for
      treatment is one of those jobs nobody wanted. Nobody except American
      Cancer Society volunteers.
      The American Cancer Society is a nonprofit organization that helps
      individuals in ___ County who have cancer. The American Cancer Society
      also has programs of research as well as children thru adult education
      programs. The American Cancer Society helps the community through its
      educational programs, and it helps those individuals in the community who
      have cancer and have nowhere to turn.
      Now the American Cancer Society could use some community support. In
      order to continue our fine programs at the present level and, hopefully,
      to expand them in the future, we need your help. If you would like to
      help us keep going, please send a contribution in the enclosed
      envelope.
      Sincerely,
      A. Neal Banister President B Unit
