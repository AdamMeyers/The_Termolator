      Dear :
      Girl Scouts of Hoosier Capital Council would like to invite you to
      join us in an investment opportunity---an investment in our future
      business and community leaders. Because of your past support, Girl Scouts
      has been able to reach out to more of our future leaders---our girls.
      Girl Scouts of Hoosier Capital Council has a strong and growing
      membership. We are requesting your continued support to meet the needs of
      our growing membership. Please consider a contribution to the Girl Scout
      Annual Campaign.
      The Girl Scout program offers an array of benefits to our girls and
      adult leaders. Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. commissioned SPEC Associates
      (Social Program Evaluators and Consultants, Inc.) to conduct a National
      Outcomes Study of the Girl Scout program. The results were overwhelmingly
      positive. Its findings include:
      Girl Scouting helps girls build nine personal assets which research
      has shown to be essential for children's healthy development and well
      being.
      Girl Scouting unites girls, families, and communities.
      Girl Scouting benefits parent/child relationships.
      Girl Scouting benefits volunteers by developing their leadership
      skills and self-confidence.
      Our ability to provide the Girl Scout program to our membership and
      reach out to more girls depends on the generosity of a caring community
      and companies like. Your investment in Girl Scouting is sure to help
      build tomorrow's leaders today.
      Sincerely,
      Marie A. Pickens Executive Director
