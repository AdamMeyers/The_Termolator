      Dear Ms. Name:
      I want to thank you for your past support of the Visiting Nurse
      Service Foundation, Inc. It is through support from individuals like
      yourself, that we are able to care for thousands of individuals each year
      who may not otherwise have been able to afford proper home health care or
      even basic services.
      I wanted to briefly share with you some of the specific uses of the
      funds that are donated each year. Our nursing staff has used funds for:
      buying prescriptions for patients who need them, but can not afford them;
      providing transportation to physician's offices for shut in patients;
      paying utility bills when there is an immediate jeopardy of shut off;
      medical supplies not covered by Medicare or other payers; fans and
      heaters for individuals; and even basic needs like food.
      Last year your memorial gift of $5 for hospice care in March gave
      VNSF, Inc. the ability to address the needs of patients I described
      above. I am asking that you consider supporting our efforts once again
      this year with a similar gift.
      Since 1913, we have remained true to our mission of providing quality
      home health care to individuals regardless of their ability to pay. By
      contributing again this year, you will help insure we can continue our
      efforts to needy individuals in Central Indiana. I have enclosed a return
      envelope for your convenience, as well as an overview of the services we
      provide. Thank you in advance for your consideration. I look forward to
      hearing from you soon.
      Sincerely,
      John L. Pipas President and CEO
