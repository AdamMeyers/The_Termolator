      Dear Name,
      As a member of the family of Girl Scouts we need your continued
      support to help these dreams become a reality.
      I am sure you are aware that Girl Scouting provides programs which
      help girls to develop values, contribute to their society, and develop to
      their own potential. With so many conflicting pressures in our society
      today-the Girl Scout program is a proven solution and supporting friends
      like you help to make it happen.
      This year's challenge is to keep pace with our growing membership
      through increased levels of support from every facet of the
      organization-board and committee members, staff, volunteers, alumni, and
      other friends. A strong participation is essential to successfully reach
      out to more girls.
      This year 20,349 girls are members of our Council. Your gift to the
      1997 Girl Scout Annual Campaign can ensure that even more girls will
      receive the benefits that Girl Scouting has to offer.
      Today's girls will be tomorrow's leaders---and they're counting on
      YOU!
      Sincerely,
      Sheron Seward President
      P.S. Thank you for your past gift to the Girl Scout Capital Campaign.
      Please consider a gift to our Annual Campaign.
