      Dear Friend:
      The good news is that the teen-age birth rate has fallen almost 9%
      since 1991. The bad news is we have a long way to go. Less than 10% of
      schools nationally have anything approaching a comprehensive sexuality
      education program. Yet, study after study has shown that unresolved
      curiosity, not knowledge, is more apt to lead to early sexual
      involvement. The mission of the Social Health Association of Central
      Indiana is "to promote healthy behavior and responsible relationships
      through sexuality education and life skills training. our education
      programs are abstinence-based, factual and encourage individuals to make
      responsible choices."
      The degreed educators of the Social Health Association provide
      in-school presentations in three areas:
      Human Growth & Development
      Sexually Transmitted Infections (including AIDS)
      Life Skills (conflict resolution, assertiveness, peer pressure and
      decision-making)
      These programs are provided at a price far below actual cost. Each
      hour of instruction costs approximately $100, of which the United Way Of
      Central Indiana pays $60. The balance comes from fees, special events,
      grants and individual gifts. Thus, your gift to Social Health is vitally
      important to our success and can accomplish the following:
      $40 will pay for one hour of programming.
      *$160 will pay for one program for an entire grade.
      *$240 will pay for all three programs in one grade.
      *$400 will pay for one program for an entire school.
      A list of the schools served during the 1996-97 school year is
      enclosed. You may designate your contribution to a specific school if you
      choose. Your support of the Social Health Association can help us make a
      real difference in the lives of our children.
      Thank you so much for your help.
      Sincerely,
      Nancy K. Haskell Executive Director
