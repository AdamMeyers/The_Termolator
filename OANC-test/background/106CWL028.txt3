      The goal of the American Cancer Society, __ Unit, is to reach the
      employees and officers of every business in the county with important
      cancer information. An informed public and financially supported research
      program are the keys to the conquest of cancer.
      We are therefore requesting your cooperation. Our free educational
      programs can save lives. Encouraging women to practice breast
      self-examination and smokers to quit smoking are just two areas of cancer
      education. The __ Unit can help your company save money by promoting good
      health practices.
      Our fight also needs financial support. All companies in (City/County)
      will have the opportunity for their employees and officers to contribute
      to the fight against cancer. The donations will enable the __ Unit to
      continue supporting the research, educational and service programs.
      Will you kindly use and return the enclosed envelope, and assure us of
      your enthusiastic participation in the continuation of the excellent work
      of the American Cancer Society.
      Sincerely,
