        Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has been
        sold commericially and used as a biopesticide worldwide for
        over half a century. However, growing public concern
        surrounding Bt use has sparked worldwide debate over
        current policies [ 1 ] . For example, in India, fear over a
        potential 
        Bombyx mori (silkworm) epizootic, or
        microbial pathogen outbreak, inspired a governmental ban on
        the use of Bt, despite the nation's continuing use of
        traditional chemical pesticides [ 2 ] .
        While pest control with Cry toxins that possess low 
        B. mori activity ( 
        i.e . Cry1Ac) is a viable solution in
        affected countries, it is worthwhile to investigate the
        specific molecular mechanisms that make Cry1Aa highly
        active. Early work took advantage of the fact that Cry1Aa,
        but not Cry1Ac, is toxic to 
        B. mori . For example, Ge 
        et al. [ 3 ] exchanged hypervariable
        regions between genes encoding the two toxins and localized
        the toxicity specifying region of Cry1Aa to residues
        332-450 in domain II. A follow-up study demonstrated the
        toxicity specifying residues were involved in binding 
        B. mori brush border membrane
        vesicles [ 4 ] . More specifically, alanine substitution or
        deletion of residues 365 to 371 removed nearly all toxicity
        and binding to 
        B. mori BBMV [ 5 ] .
        Recently, research on 
        B. mori has focused on purifying and
        cloning the midgut epithelial receptors targeted by Cry1Aa
        toxin. The first toxin-binding receptor purified from 
        B. mori was a 120-kDa aminopeptidase
        N (APN), which appears around 110-kDa on SDS-PAGE gels when
        preparative conditions are used that cleave its
        glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. This receptor
        was shown to bind Cry1Aa with a 7.6 nM affinity, as
        determined by Scatchard analysis with ELISA binding assays
        [ 6 ] . The APN was cloned and expressed in 
        E. coli and demonstrated to bind
        Cry1Aa toxin on ligand blots [ 7 ] . These results indicate
        the Cry1Aa-APN interaction was specific and that APN
        glycosylation was not required for Cry1Aa binding. This is
        not altogether surprising because Cry1Aa binding to 
        Manduca sexta APN has not been found
        to be modulated by sugar binding [ 8 ] and the 
        B. mori APN sequence is 73.7%
        identical to 
        M. sexta APN-1. Sequence alignments
        with 
        Plutella xylostella APN receptor
        indicate that a highly conserved region of APN likely
        functions as the toxin binding site [ 9 ] . By testing for
        toxin binding to lysylendopeptidase-digested 
        B. mori APN fragments, the toxin
        binding site was suggested to be between Ile135 and Pro198.
        A later study by these authors identified 120-kDa and
        115-kDa APNs coeluting from an anion-exchange column that
        together yielded a Cry1Aa affinity of 53 nM [ 10 ] . These
        APNs eluted just prior to a 120 kDa APN with 7.6 nM
        affinity. It is unclear whether the 120- and 115-kDa
        proteins represent uncleaved and cleaved GPI-anchor
        isozymes. Interestingly, this study also showed that Cry1Ac
        toxin binds to the 120/115 kDa APN fraction with equal
        affinity as Cry1Aa, and only 4-fold reduced affinity to the
        isolated 120-kDa APN. Nonetheless, Cry1Aa is 210 times more
        toxic than Cry1Ac to 
        B. mori [ 4 ] . As a whole, 
        B. mori APN research indicates the
        presence of at least three genetic isoforms [ 7 11 12 ] ,
        with toxin affinities ranging from nanomolar to none at
        all.
        In addition to APN, a completely different toxin
        receptor class has been affinity precipitated by toxin from
        solubilized 
        B. mori midgut proteins. In this
        manner, Nagamatsu 
        et al. [ 13 ] purified a 175-kDa
        glycoprotein (BtR175) that bound Cry1Aa toxin.
        Interestingly, these authors did not observe binding of
        Cry1Aa to APN-sized bands in ligand blot studies with BBMV.
        Antibodies produced to BtR175 blocked toxin binding to the
        receptor in BBMV. The antibody serum also reduced Cry1Aa
        activity against 
        B. mori when it was fed to larvae
        prior to toxin addition to the diet [ 14 ] . The same group
        cloned and introduced the BtR175 gene with a baculovirus
        vector into 
        Spodptera frugiperda Sf9 cells.
        Addition of Cry1Aa caused swelling and lysis of only the
        Sf9 cells expressing BtR175. Based on sequence analysis,
        the receptor was characterized as a cadherin-like
        glycoprotein containing nine cadherin repeats, a membrane
        proximal region, one transmembrane region, and a small
        cytoplasmic domain [ 15 ] . Ihara 
        et al. [ 16 ] also purified and
        partially sequenced what was presumed to be the same
        cadherin-like receptor. Binding studies indicated that the
        affinity of the cadherin for Cry1Aa is equivalent to that
        of the brush border membrane vesicles from 
        B. mori [ 16 ] , an affinity that is
        substantially lower than the APN affinities reported.
        Recently, cDNA variants of BtR175 have been discovered,
        showing at least three alleles of the cadherin-like
        receptor are found in 
        B. mori [ 17 ] . It is likely that
        glycosylation plays a major role in cadherin-like receptor
        isoforms as well, as glycosylation has been observed
        previously for the 
        M. sexta cadherin-like receptor BT-R 
        1 [ 18 ] .
        Progress in research on silkworm receptors for Bt toxins
        has provided a means for assaying mutant toxins with
        potentially altered binding and activity. In this study, we
        tested the hypothesis that Cry1Aa binds to both the 120-kDa
        
        B. mori APN and the 175-kDa 
        B. mori cadherin-like protein. Based
        on the previous work of Ge, et al. [ 3 ] and Lee, et al. [
        4 ] , we also postulated that domain II of Cry1Aa is the
        significant binding domain. These hypotheses were tested
        for the first time in studies with purified, native 
        B. mori receptors (rather than BBMV)
        under real-time, non-labeled toxin binding conditions.
      
      
        Results
        
          Bombyx mori aminopeptidase N and cadherin-like
          receptor purification
          To investigate the specificity of Cry toxins for 
          B. mori receptors, the two known 
          B. mori midgut receptors were
          purified from 
          B. mori BBMV. Solubilized 
          B. mori BBMV proteins were
          separated by Q Sepharose anion-exchange chromatography
          and all eluted fractions were tested for APN enzymatic
          activity. Additionally, Cry1Aa toxin binding capability
          was assayed by "slot blotting" all fractions and probing
          with biotin-Cry1Aa. The chromatogram in Fig. 1displays
          the separation of cadherin and APN from BBMV proteins.
          APN isozymes of 100- and 110-kDa were detected that did
          not show Cry1Aa-binding in slot blot assays (Fig. 1;
          fractions 24-25 and 30-31). Such isozymes have been
          reported previously [ 11 12 ] . In addition, a 115-kDa
          APN was detected with Cry1Aa-binding capability (Fig. 1;
          fractions 33-36). As expected, fractions were also
          observed that exhibited no APN enzymatic activity but
          bound Cry1Aa on slot blots (Fig. 1; fractions 26-27).
          Initially these fractions were predicted to contain the
          cadherin-like Cry1Aa-binding protein [ 13 14 16 ] . The
          candidate receptor fractions for APN and cadherin were
          separately loaded on a size-exclusion column for further
          purification (Fig. 2Aand 2B). A protein with APN
          enzymatic activity eluted 75 minutes after injection
          (Fig. 2A; fractions 15-16), approximately 4 minutes after
          the 120-kDa 
          L. dispar APN elutes on the same
          column [ 19 ] . The candidate cadherin-like receptor
          fraction eluted in fractions 9-11 at around 180 kDa (Fig.
          2B).
        
        
          Analysis of receptor purity
          The pooled and concentrated candidate receptor
          fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE before and after
          size-exclusion purification to assess purity (Fig. 3).
          The putative cadherin-like receptor material appears at a
          molecular size around 180 kDa, both before and after
          secondary purification (Lanes 2 and 1, respectively).
          Several BBMV proteins appear present in the
          APN-containing fraction prior to size-exclusion
          purification (Fig. 3; Lane 4). The molecular weight of
          the final, purified APN was estimated to be 115-120 kDa
          (Fig. 3; Lane 3). It is not known whether the GPI anchor
          is still intact on the APN receptor; however, in the
          current study, phosphatidylinositol-specific
          phospholipase C (PIPLC) was not used during BBMV
          preparation. It was shown previously that APN may be
          purified with intact GPI-anchors if PIPLC is omitted from
          the preparation buffer [ 6 ] . It is likely that our APN
          has similarly retained the GPI anchor.
          In view of the fact that 
          B. mori BtR175 possesses sequence
          similarity to 
          M. sexta BT-R 
          1 , the candidate fraction was probed
          on a slot blot with anti-BT-R 
          1 polyclonal antiserum. A weak to
          moderate cross-reactivity with anti-BT-R 
          1 was observed for 
          B. mori BBMV as well as the
          putative cadherin-like receptor fraction, providing
          strong evidence that the material is a cadherin-like
          protein (Fig. 4). Anti-Bt-R 
          1 antibody recognition was not
          observed for fractions eluting before and after the
          cadherin material, nor for the purified APN (Fig. 4).
          Similar antibody assays were not performed to
          substantiate the identity of the purified APN because it
          clearly displayed strong, characteristic APN enzyme
          activity.
          The purity of both receptors was further examined by a
          Cry1Aa toxin ligand blot (Fig. 5). Both APN and the
          cadherin-like receptor fractions bound biotinylated
          Cry1Aa. No other toxin-binding bands were apparent, and
          neither purified receptor sample was visibly
          cross-contaminated with the other receptor (Fig. 5).
        
        
          Affinity estimation by surface plasmon
          resonance
          Cry toxin binding studies have been reported
          previously for 
          B. mori that used BBMV assays or
          used purified receptors in ELISA assays or blots;
          however, no Cry toxin studies concerning 
          B. mori have been published
          employing SPR analysis. The affinity of Cry1Aa binding to
          
          B. mori APN and 
          B. mori cadherin receptors was
          evaluated by real-time kinetic analysis on a BIAcore
          2000. Simple bimolecular binding of Cry1Aa was observed
          to both 
          B. mori APN and cadherin (Fig.
          6Aand 6B). Toxin-receptor on-rates for association ( 
          k 
          a ), off-rates for dissociation ( 
          k 
          d ), and overall binding affinity ( 
          k 
          d / 
          k 
          a , or 
          K 
          D ) were calculated for toxin binding.
          The apparent rate constants for wild-type Cry1Aa and 
          B. mori APN were 
          k 
          a = 2.0 × 10 4M -1s -1(+/- 1.3 × 10
          2), 
          k 
          d = 1.5 × 10 -3s -1(+/- 1 × 10 -5),
          and 
          K 
          D = 75 nM. To 
          B. mori cadherin, significantly
          tighter affinities were obtained: 
          k 
          a = 1.3 × 10 4M -1s -1(+/- 6.1), 
          k 
          d = 3.3 × 10 -5s -1(+/- 1 × 10 -5), 
          K 
          D = 2.6 nM. This apparent off-rate
          clearly accounted for Cry1Aa's higher affinity for
          cadherin than for APN. The cadherin off-rate observed in
          this study could have significant consequences in vivo:
          slow toxin dissociation may enable protracted lingering
          near the brush border membrane surface, greatly
          facilitating toxic (domain I) insertion and subsequent
          pore formation. The overall affinity determined in the
          present study for Cry1Aa to BtR175 (2.6 nM) agrees well
          with the findings of Ihara 
          et al. [ 16 ] by a different assay
          (0.8 nM).
          We also explored the specificity of Cry1Aa for the
          native 
          B. mori receptors by comparing the
          binding response of Cry1Aa with the binding of Cry1Ab,
          Cry1Ac, and domain-switched toxin 4109 (Fig. 7Aand 7B).
          Hybrid toxin 4109 is particular useful in this context,
          because it is comprised of domains I and II from Cry1Aa
          and domain III from Cry1Ac (Aa/Aa/Ac) [ 3 ] .
          Hybrid-toxin 4109 binding to both receptors was not
          noticeably different from Cry1Aa: for APN binding, 
          k 
          a = 1.9 × 10 4M -1s -1(+/- 1.4 × 10
          2), 
          k 
          d = 1.5 × 10 -3s -1(+/- 1.6 × 10 -5),
          and 
          K 
          D = 78 nM; for cadherin binding, 
          k 
          a = 1.3 × 10 4M -1s -1(+/- 2 × 10 2), 
          k 
          d = 3.34 × 10 -5s -1(+/- 2 × 10 -5),
          and 
          K 
          D = 2.6 nM. In stark contrast, Cry1Ab
          and Cry1Ac showed no apparent binding to either receptor
          (Fig. 7Aand 7B). These results are entirely consistent
          with the hypothesis that Cry1Aa domain II (alone) is
          essential for binding to both the APN and cadherin-like
          receptors as purified in the present study.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The dissociation constants presented are the first
        determined for 
        B. mori Cry receptors by the use of
        SPR technology. Additionally, the apparent affinity of
        Cry1Aa for the cadherin-like receptor is the highest
        observed affinity to date for Cry toxin binding to purified
        receptors using SPR. This finding emphasizes the important
        biological role that this receptor class plays for Bt
        toxins. Recently, using phage display technology, a scFv
        molecule with short sequence homology to 
        M. sexta and 
        B. mori cadherin-like receptors was
        shown to bind domain II of Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, and Cry1Ac
        toxins [ 20 ] . In the present study, only Cry1Aa shows
        measurable binding to the purified, native cadherin-like
        receptor from 
        B. mori . This finding may be the
        result of purification of a particular receptor variant
        with Cry1Aa specificity (e.g., one of potentially several
        glycosylated isoforms). Alternatively, it may reflect
        greater specificity of Cry1Aa domain II for neighboring
        residues on the 
        B. mori cadherin-like receptor beyond
        the conserved Cry1A-toxin binding segment, which might be
        absent in smaller peptide sequences.
        The apparent Cry1Aa affinity for purified APN measured
        in this study, 75 nM, is 10-fold higher than the value
        reported by Yaoi 
        et al. [ 6 ] for purified 110-kDa APN
        using a separate technique (7.6 nM). In the aforementioned
        study, an ELISA assay was used to indirectly calculate
        affinity by incubating receptor-bound toxin with a
        peroxidase-conjugated anti-Cry1Aa antibody over 1.5 hours
        at 37°C. It is possible that the difference in binding
        constants reflects our condition of more direct
        receptor-binding measurement in "real-time", as well as the
        different binding buffers and temperature used.
        Yaoi 
        et al. [ 21 ] estimated the
        toxin-binding region of 
        B. mori APN to be between Ile135 and
        Pro198 based on toxin blot overlays with protease-digested
        APN fragments. BLAST sequence alignments [ 22 ] yielded 81%
        identity and 96% similarity between this 63 residue stretch
        and the homologous region of 
        M. sexta APN-1, which also binds
        Cry1Aa toxin (Jenkins, unpublished observation).
        Interestingly, in 
        L. dispar APN-1, which does not bind
        Cry1Aa, the same stretch is only 37% identical and 56%
        similar (4% unaligned gaps). These results appear to
        support the findings of Yaoi 
        et al. [ 21 ] . However, 
        Heliothis virescens (tobacco budworm)
        APN is only 45% identical and 53% similar to 
        B. mori APN, yet it binds Cry1Aa
        toxin with high affinity [ 23 ] . Moreover, sequence
        alignments with APN from 
        Lactobacillus , 
        Streptococcus , 
        Saccharomyces , 
        Arabidopsis , rat, pig, yeast, and
        human yielded more similarity than 
        H. virescens APN to the putative
        Cry1Aa-binding region of 
        B. mori APN. It is likely that as the
        X-ray crystal structures of APNs are solved, structural
        alignments of APNs will help resolve the
        specificity-determining regions more accurately.
        Additionally, structural information will aid in the
        rational construction of toxins with reduced binding for
        beneficial insects without losing activity to target pests.
        In this context a unique Cry1Aa binding epitope within
        domain II has been identified that, when mutated, results
        in specific reduction of toxicity to 
        B. mori (You, et al., unpublished
        manuscript). The application of protein engineering to 
        B. thuringiensis insecticidal
        proteins is entering a new era of tailoring pesticides with
        reduced activity to beneficial insects as well as
        increasing activity against pest insects [ 24 ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        Domain II of Cry1Aa is both necessary and essential for
        tight binding to two 
        B. mori midgut receptors, the
        cadherin-like and aminopeptidase N receptors, a finding
        that correlates with biological activity data. The Cry1Aa
        binding affinity, as well as the dissociation rate for the
        cadherin-like receptor, are the lowest measured using the
        surface plasmon resonance technique. The SPR method
        presented here may be useful for screening other Cry toxins
        or Cry toxin variants specifically engineered to reduce or
        eliminate specificity for receptors from this non-target
        insect.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Mutant toxin construction and preliminary
          analysis
          Hybrid toxin 4109 consisting of domains I and II of
          Cry1Aa and domain III of Cry1Ac was constructed as
          previously described [ 3 ] . Force-feeding bioassays on 
          B. mori and BBMV binding assays
          were conducted as described [ 4 ] . Crystal proteins were
          solubilized and trypsinized, and active toxins were
          column purified as carried out previously [ 19 ] .
        
        
          Receptor purification
          
          B. mori midguts were dissected from
          4 thor 5 thinstar larvae and brush border membrane
          vesicles were prepared by the Wolfersberger method [ 25 ]
          . 
          B. mori BBMV (10 mg in 10 ml) was
          solubilized in 5 mg/ml CHAPS zwitterionic detergent
          (Roche) overnight at 4 oC with gentle rocking.
          Solubilized BBMV was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min
          and supernatant was concentrated to 2 ml by Amicon YM30
          ultrafiltration. The sample was then loaded on a Q
          Sepharose HR 10/30 anion-exchange column. All column
          chromatography was carried out on an ÄKTA Explorer
          (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Low salt buffer (buffer A)
          consisted of 20 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl, 0.4 mg/ml CHAPS, pH
          8.6, and the high salt buffer used was buffer A
          containing 1 M NaCl. A step gradient of salt was used to
          elute BBMV proteins. All fractions were tested for APN
          enzymatic activity by the LpNA assay. Briefly, 390 μl of
          sample are mixed with 10 μl of 2 mM
          leucine-p-nitroanilide (containing a
          leucine-phenylalanine dipeptide). A yellow chromophoric
          change indicates aminopeptidase N activity, defined as
          the ability to cleave a neutral amino acid from the
          N-terminus of a polypeptide. Cry1Aa binding ability was
          also checked by slot blotting fractions to PVDF membrane
          and probing with biotinylated Cry1Aa [ 26 ] . Fractions
          with Cry1Aa-binding ability and APN enzymatic activity
          were concentrated to 2 ml volumes and loaded on a
          Superdex 200 size-exclusion column (120 ml bed volume)
          using Hepes-buffered saline (HBS; 10 mM Hepes, 150 mM
          NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) as running buffer. Absorbance
          was monitored at 280 nm and 260 nm to judge protein
          purity of collected peaks relative to flow through.
          Fractions eluting around 115-120 kDa, the MW of APN, were
          collected and protease inhibitors were added after a
          final concentration. Anion-exchange fractions with
          Cry1Aa-binding ability but without APN enzymatic activity
          were also size-purifed, and fractions eluting around
          175-250 kDa, the MW of BtR175, were collected and
          concentrated. Approximately 0.10 mg (in 0.25 ml) of
          cadherin-like receptor and 0.30 mg of APN (in 1 ml) were
          obtained.
        
        
          Analysis of receptor purity
          Candidate receptor fractions were analyzed by 10%
          SDS-PAGE (40 μl/lane) and stained with Coomassie
          brilliant blue. For slot blot assays, 5 μg of 
          M. sexta or 
          B. mori BBMVs and 40 μl of
          candidate receptor fractions were blotted onto PVDF
          membrane and assays was carried out as reported
          previously [ 27 ] , except for using 1:1000 anti-Bt-R 
          1 polyclonal antiserum. For ligand
          blot assays, samples separated by SDS-PAGE (9%) were
          transferred to PVDF overnight, blocked with 5% dried milk
          in TTBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH
          7.5). Samples were probed with 50 μg biotin-Cry1Aa and
          streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase for 1 hr
          each, with 45 min TTBS washes, and developed in DAB/Urea
          (BioRad).
        
        
          Surface plasmon resonance with purified midgut
          receptors
          
          B. mori APN and cadherin were
          immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip by the amine-coupling
          method (Biacore AB). Receptors were diluted into ammonium
          acetate, pH 4.2 prior to immobilization. An HBS (pH 7.4)
          buffer flow rate of 50 μl/min was used for all
          injections. Randomized toxin concentrations varying from
          100 nM to 1000 nM were injected (110 μl) over the
          receptor surfaces. Surfaces were regenerated with 6 μl
          pulses of 10 mM NaOH, 250 μM ethylene glycol, pH 11.0 at
          100 μl/min. Signal responses from a blank flowcell
          containing ethanolamine as a blocking agent were
          subtracted from all response curves and data were fitted
          using BIAevaluation 3.0. The curves were fit to a simple
          1:1 Langmuir binding model to obtain apparent rate
          constants (A + B ↔ AB).
