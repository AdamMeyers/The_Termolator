      YWCA of Indianapolis' "Everyone belongs" Summer Day Camp. And are we
      going to have fun! Our camp staff worked all winter long planning some
      great activities to keep everyone safe and active this summer. We'll be
      swimming, planning sports, going on exciting field trips, helping others
      through community service projects, planning our own camp carnival, and
      joining great clubs like jewelry making, juggling, snack cooking, and
      nature crafts. As you can imagine, a summer like this is expensive to
      provide. And more than 30% of the kids we serve cannot afford the camp
      fee. Won't you help the WYCA provide a great summer for those kids?
