        Scorpion venom is a rich source of various polypeptides
        with diverse physiological and pharmacological activities
        which generally exert their action via target specific
        modulation of ion channel function [ 1 2 3 ] . Among the
        well characterized peptide toxins are those from the venom
        of scorpions belonging to the family Buthidae. Buthoid
        venom has been reported to strongly affect a wide variety
        of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms [ 4 ] and its
        toxicity is attributed to the presence of a large variety
        of basic polypeptides cross-linked by 3-4 disulfide bridges
        [ 1 4 ] . Based on their molecular size and pharmacological
        activity, these toxins are classified into two main groups.
        The first group contains short toxins (30-40 amino acid
        residues) with 3-4 disulfide bridges which mainly affect
        the voltage dependent K +channels and the large conductance
        calcium activated K +channels [ 5 6 ] . The second group
        includes long-chain (60-70 amino acids) peptides cross
        linked by 4 disulfide bridges which mainly have an effect
        on voltage dependent sodium channels of excitable cells [ 1
        2 ] . According to their species selectivity sodium channel
        toxins have been divided into mammalian and insect toxins.
        Furthermore, depending on their binding affinities and
        electrophysiological properties, the mammalian toxins are
        sub-classified into α- and β- toxins [ 7 8 ] , and the
        insect-specific toxins are subdivided into excitatory,
        depressant and α- insect toxins [ 9 ] . Several toxins
        which specifically affect sodium and potassium channels
        have been extensively studied with respect to their
        structure, mode of action and pharmacological properties [
        4 6 10 ] . In addition to the two main groups of toxins,
        several other toxins targeted toward Ca 2+ [ 5 ] and Cl - [
        11 ] channels have also been isolated during the past
        decade.
        Owing to their species selectivity, increasing attention
        has been paid in recent years to identify insect-selective
        toxins that can be used to develop recombinant
        biopesticides as a safer alternative to broad spectrum
        chemical insecticides [ 12 13 14 ] . Several
        insect-selective toxins have been identified and purified
        from scorpions collected in different geographical
        locations [ 2 11 15 16 17 18 ] . However, the Indian red
        scorpion, 
        Mesobuthus tamulus, known for its
        severe toxicity [ 19 20 ] received little attention in this
        regard. The few studies documented on 
        Buthus tamulus are restricted to the
        isolation and purification of neurotoxins, protease
        inhibitors, histamine releasers [ 19 ] iberiotoxin, an
        inhibitor of high conductance Ca 2+-activated K +channel [
        21 ] and neurotoxin Bt-II [ 20 ] . In the quest for natural
        insect-selective toxins, we have identified a novel short
        lepidopteran-selective toxin from the venom of 
        Mesobuthus tamulus having 37 amino
        acids residues and 8 half-cystines. We named it as ButaIT (
        
        B. tamulus insect toxin) which has
        high sequence homology with a few short toxins [ 11 22 23
        24 25 26 27 ] and shows high selectivity to a lepidopteran
        insect, 
        Heliothis virescens. This paper
        describes isolation, purification, and sequence
        determination of this toxin.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Bioassay driven purification of ButaIT
          The CM-52 cation exchange column yielded 7 peaks at
          280 nm (Fig- 1). When CM fractions were tested for
          lethality on mice, only CM-fraction III and crude venom
          were found to be toxic at a dose of 3 μg/g body weight.
          Among all the CM fractions, CM fraction IV accounted for
          almost all of the lethality to tobacco budworm. Hence
          further studies were conducted using only CM fraction IV.
          Fractionation of CM-IV yielded 14 peaks using ion-pair
          reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 2). Bioassay of the individual
          HPLC fractions of CM-IV fraction on tobacco budworm,
          blowfly larvae and mice led to the localization of
          lepidopteran selective toxicity in CM-IV fraction 6
          (Table 1). Administration of CM-IV HPLC fractions to
          tobacco budworm at a dose of 1 μg/100 mg larva showed
          slow and progressive flaccid paralysis only with fraction
          6. Other fractions were ineffective at this dose. Hence,
          fraction 6 (CM-IV-6) was collected, lyophilized and
          resolved further using HPLC gradient system-II which
          yielded two peaks: CM-IV-6A and CM-IV-6B. Among the two,
          fraction CM-IV-6A was found to induce progressive,
          irreversible flaccid paralysis at the dose of 1 μg/100 mg
          per larva of 
          Heliothis virescens. Neither of
          these fractions induced any significant toxic symptoms in
          blowfly larvae or mice. This fraction was further
          purified to apparent homogeneity by microbore HPLC and
          the purity was confirmed by capillary electrophoresis
          (Fig. 3). This fraction is estimated to account for
          0.026% of the total protein content of the dry venom.
        
        
          Structural analysis
          The molecular mass of the peptide toxin determined by
          ESI-MS was 3856.7Da (Fig. 4) which is in agreement with
          the molecular mass calculated from the amino acid
          sequence when the toxin is in its native form with four
          disulfide bridges as observed in other similar toxins. An
          examination of multiple sequence alignment with known
          insect toxins using BLAST search [ 28 ] revealed that
          ButaIT toxin shows considerable homology (Fig. 5) with
          short insect toxins, and shows highest percentage
          identity with peptide I (68%) and LQH-8/6 (68%) followed
          by neurotoxin P2 (66%), chlorotoxin (64%), insectotoxin
          I5A (60%), insect toxin I5 (60%) and insectotoxin II
          (52%) [ 11 22 23 24 25 26 27 ] .
          Toxins of buthid venoms constitute a family of closely
          related peptides which could be classified into several
          structurally related peptides depending on their amino
          acid [ 1 ] . Although the information available on the
          mode of action of these toxins is limited, it appears
          that different short toxins exhibit considerable
          diversity in their physiological mechanisms in spite of
          their structural homology. For example Fazal 
          et al. , [ 25 ] reported that
          peptide I is related to neurophysin, agglutinins [ 29 30
          ] and other peptides of the four-disulfide core family
          with toxin/agglutinin fold. The neurotoxin P2 (35 ammo
          acids), another short toxin and a structural homologue of
          short insectotoxin II and 15, shows toxicity towards 
          Sarcophaga falculata and
          crustaceans [ 26 ] . Chlorotoxin, isolated from 
          Leiurus quinquestriatus
          haebraeus, shows Cl -channel-blocking activity and
          causes paralysis due to the inhibition of structurally
          related anion channels such as the extrajunctional
          channels of arthropod muscles [ 11 ] . It has also been
          reported that the short insectotoxin I5A may act on a
          "glutamate receptor of the postsynaptic membrane" [ 22 ]
          . Although no specific experimental evidence is available
          on the mode of action of ButaIT, it is assumed that
          ButaIT exerts similar ion channel blocking activity as
          that of other short insect toxins. However a detailed
          physiological and pharmacological analysis is necessary
          to define the exact mechanism of ButaIT in spite of its
          high sequence and structural homology with other insect
          toxins.
          Considering the high degree of sequence similarity, it
          is presumed that ButaIT will have a similar 3-D structure
          to that of other short toxins. The 3-D structures of
          several short toxins such as charybdotoxin (ChTX) [ 17 ]
          , iberiotoxin (IbTx) [ 31 ] , kaliotoxin (KxTx) [ 32 33 ]
          margatoxin (MgTx) [ 34 ] , maurotoxin [ 35 ] , agitoxin
          (AgTx) [ 36 ] , noxiustoxin (NTX) [ 37 ] , PiL [ 10 ] ,
          insectotoxin I5A [ 22 ] , LQH-8/6 [ 27 ] and chlorotoxin
          [ 38 ] have been determined by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray
          crystallography. A structure model of ButaIT, generated
          from the Swiss-model protein modeling server based on the
          structural coordinates of chlorotoxin [ 38 ] and
          insectotoxin I5A [ 22 ] showed that ButaIT adopts a
          typical core structure of scorpion toxins primarily
          composed of one α-helix and three β-strands with four
          disulfide bridges, a feature similar to other toxins of
          similar size that act on K +and Cl -channels [ 17 31 34
          38 ] . It is also evident from the data that disulfide
          bridge formation in ButaIT likely follows a common motif,
          with covalent links between cysl6-cys32, cys5-cys27,
          cys20-cys34 and an additional disulfide bridge between
          cys2 and cys 19 which cross-links the N-terminal strand
          of the β-sheet to the α-helix. Experiments are underway
          to purify larger quantities of ButaIT using baculovirus
          expression system in order to establish a refined
          structure/function relationship.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Here we report the isolation of a short insecticidal
        toxin from the venom of 
        Mesobuthus tamulus. The most
        important characteristic of this novel toxin is its
        specificity towards 
        Heliothis virescens, the tobacco
        budworm, a worldwide pest of numerous valuable crops such
        as cotton. When expressed in baculovirus system as a
        biopesticide scorpion toxins offer the advantage of faster
        kill without chemical insecticides [ 13 ] . Although the
        safety of recombinant baculoviruses is less of a concern
        ButaIT offers an extra level of safety as a recombinant
        biopesticide due to its specificity to tobacco budworm ion
        channels. Moreover this toxin can be utilized as a specific
        probe of tobacco budworm ion channels. Chemical libraries
        can be screened for the ability to displace ButaIT leading
        to the discovery of better pesticides.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Toxin purification
          The crude venom of 
          Mesobuthus tamulus was purchased
          from Haffkine Institute (Bombay, India). Lyophilized
          venom (50 mg) was homogenized in 2 ml of 10 mM ammonium
          acetate (pH 6.4) using Potter-Elvehjam homogenizer and
          the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at
          15,000 rpm for 20 min. An additional 1 ml of ammonium
          acetate was added to the pellet, the homogenization was
          repeated, the contents were centrifuged and the
          supernatant was collected. The above procedure was
          repeated 4 to 5 times to maximize the yield of peptide
          toxins from the crude venom. The supernatant fractions
          were pooled, passed through a pre-cycled CM-52 column and
          eluted with a gradient of 0.01 M to 0.5 M ammonium
          acetate (pH 6.4) at a flow rate of 3 ml/h using a
          Pharmacia peristaltic pump. Fractions (3 ml), were
          collected using a BioRad (Model 2110) fraction collector.
          All the chromatographic separations were carried out at
          4°C. Individual fractions were monitored at 280 nm using
          a Shimadzu spectrophotometer (UV 2101 PC). The active
          fractions under the same absorbency peak were pooled and
          freeze dried. Chromatographic analysis of CM-fractions
          was done by HPLC (Perkin-Elmer Series 410 pump) which was
          equipped with a LC-235 diode array detector. The UV
          measurements were performed simultaneously at 215 and 280
          nm. A 10 μm particle size Protein C4 column (25 cm × 4.5
          mm ID; Vydac, Hesperia, CA, USA) was used in conjunction
          with a C4 guard column cartridge. The column was
          maintained at room temperature (25°C). Chromatographic
          peaks were integrated on an Everex 386/20 PC using Omega
          software and Perkin-Elmer GP-100 graphics integrator. The
          freeze dried CM-fractions were resuspended in water and
          aliquots of 1 mg each were loaded onto the C4 reversed
          phase column equilibrated in Solvent A (A= 5%
          acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluroacetic acid, TFA). The
          individual proteins were eluted from the column with a
          linear gradient reaching 60% Solvent B (B= 95%
          acetonitrile; 0.1% TFA) in 70 min at a flow rate of 0.6
          ml/min. (Gradient system-I). All the fractions were
          collected, freeze dried and assayed for biological
          activity. The active fractions were further purified
          using a Protein C4 Column (Vydac 25 cm × 4.6 mm ID)
          equilibrated with Solvent A (A= 5% acetonitrile; 0.1%
          heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) and resolution of peaks
          was accomplished using gradient elution of solvent B (B=
          95% acetonitrile; 0.1% HFBA) reaching 60% in 70 min at a
          flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. (Gradient system-II). Individual
          peaks were collected, lyophilized and used for bioassays.
          The protein concentrations of the samples were determined
          using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum
          albumin as the standard. Following two HPLC steps, the
          toxins were further purified using a Reliasil C18
          reversed-phase column (Michrom 10 cm × 1 mm ID)on a
          Microbore HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources Inc., USA).
          The insect-selective toxin was loaded onto the C18 column
          and eluted in a linear gradient of 10-60 % Solvent B (95%
          acetonitrile; 0.1% TFA) over 60 min at a flow rate of 100
          μl/min.
        
        
          Purity determination
          The purity of the toxins was evaluated by free
          solution capillary electrophoresis on an Applied
          Biosystems capillary electrophoresis Model 270A. The 75
          cm capillary was equilibrated for 4 minutes with 20 mM
          sodium citrate buffer (pH 2.9) and the toxin (0.2 mg/ml)
          was loaded using vacuum for 2 seconds. Resolution of
          peaks were performed using 20 mM sodium citrate buffer
          (pH 2.9) at 20 kV electric potential and the absorbance
          was monitored at 215 nm.
        
        
          Mass spectrometry
          The molecular mass of ButaIT was determined using
          electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a VG/Fisons
          Quattro-BD mass spectrometer (VG Biotech, Altrincham,
          UK). The delivery of mobile phase (50% acetonitrile/0.05%
          formic acid; v/v) was performed with ISCO μLC-500 syringe
          pump at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The purified toxin
          collected from microbore HPLC was analyzed by direct flow
          injection of 10 μl. The spectral analysis was done in a
          positive ion mode at a capillary voltage of +3.5 kV, a
          cone voltage of 50 V and at a source temperature of 70°C.
          Spectra were scanned over the range of 200-2000 m/z at a
          rate of 20 sec/scan ; 20 scans were combined using the
          VGMCA acquisition mode. The molecular weight of the toxin
          was determined using the maximum entropy deconvolution
          algorithm (MaxEnt) to transform the range of 650/1500 m/z
          to give a true mass scale spectrum. The mass calibration
          was performed using heart myoglobin (Sigma)
        
        
          Bioassay of toxins
          The individual lyophilized fractions were dissolved in
          deionized water, and an appropriate concentration of each
          fraction was injected into fourth instar 
          Heliothis virescens (tobacco
          budworm) and last instar larvae of 
          Sarcophaga falculata (blowfly). The
          neurotoxic symptoms in the larvae were observed
          continuously for 30 minutes and also after 24 hr.
          post-injection. Complete immobility or paralysis was
          taken as an indication for the neurotoxic activity in
          insect larvae. Each fraction was also injected
          subcutaneously into mice in order to check for any
          mammalian toxicity.
        
        
          Sequence determination
          The purified ButaIT was reduced and carboxymethylated
          by incubating in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 M
          Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1 mM EDTA and 20 mM dithiothreitol for
          1 hr at 37°C. Iodoacetic acid was added to a final
          concentration of 50 mM and incubated for an additional
          hour at 37°C in the dark. The N-terminal sequence of the
          toxin was determined using HP GS1000 sequence analyzer by
          automated Edman degradation at the Molecular Structure
          Facility of UC Davis.
        
        
          Homology modeling
          The amino acid sequence of ButaIT was submitted to
          Swiss-Model Protein modeling server (Guex and Peitsch,
          1997; Peitsch, 1995; Peitsch, 1996; Preitsch and Guex,
          1997) and the three dimensional model structure was
          extracted as PDB file based on the NMR coordinates of
          apparently homologous scorpion toxins such as chlorotoxin
          (PDB entry : 1Chl.pdb) and insectotoxin I5A (PDB entry:
          1SIS.pdb). Visualization of the 3D structure was
          performed using RasMol Molecular PDB visualization
          software.
          Note: The amino acid sequence of novel
          lepidopteran-selective toxin reported in this paper will
          appear in the SWISS-PROT protein data bank under the
          accession number P81761.
