        The liver exclusively synthesizes bile acids from
        cholesterol via two biosynthetic pathways. The "classical"
        pathway begins with the 7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol and
        operates entirely in the liver [ 1 ] . The "alternative"
        pathway begins with the hydroxylation of the cholesterol
        side chain. Although this reaction occurs in a wide variety
        of cells, the completion of bile acid synthesis takes place
        in liver cells. The classical pathway is responsible for
        the bulk of the bile acids synthesized by the liver [ 2 3 ]
        .
        The major bile acid species produced by the liver are
        cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids. These bile acids are
        conjugated to either taurine or glycine before secretion
        into bile [ 4 ] , which is subsequently released into the
        small intestine. Bile acids are reclaimed from the lumen of
        the intestine and returned to the liver via portal blood
        for reuse [ 1 ] . The recovery of bile acids from the
        intestine is an efficient process that involves both
        passive transport along the entire axis of the intestine,
        and active transport in the terminal ileum [ 5 ] . The
        apical sodium/bile acid co-transporter (asbt) mediates the
        active uptake of conjugated bile acids in the ileum [ 5 6 ]
        . In hepatocytes, both sodium-dependent and
        sodium-independent transport systems on the sinusoidal
        membranes extract bile acids from portal blood. Of these,
        the sodium/bile acid co-transporting polypeptide (ntcp) is
        considered to be quantitatively the most important
        transporter of conjugated bile acids in these cells [ 7 8 ]
        . The transport of bile acids from the basolateral to the
        canalicular membrane of liver cells is a poorly understood
        process. Intracellular bile acid binding proteins have been
        postulated to participate in the transcellular transport as
        well as to buffer against the cytotoxic effects of bile
        acids. ATP-dependent transporters on the canalicular
        membranes of hepatocytes mediate the secretion of bile
        acids into bile [ 9 ] .
        Recently, it was discovered that bile acids are the
        natural ligands for a nuclear receptor termed farnesoid x
        receptor (FXR; NR1H4) [ 10 11 12 ] . Therefore, bile acids
        may be important regulators of gene expression in the liver
        and intestines. To date, the genes that have been shown to
        be responsive to regulation by FXR encode proteins involved
        in the biosynthesis and transport of bile acids [ 13 ] .
        Bile acids have been shown to modulate a variety of other
        cellular functions, such as secretion of lipoproteins from
        hepatocytes [ 14 15 ] and translocation of bile acid
        transporters to the hepatocyte canalicular membrane [ 16 ]
        . In McNtcp cells, which are liver-derived cells engineered
        to transport bile acids actively [ 17 ] ,
        taurine-conjugated bile acids induce the formation of
        intracellular vesicles that resembles structures observed
        in cholestatic liver cells without apparent cellular
        cytotoxicity [ 1 18 ] . In contrast, glycine-conjugated
        bile acids promote apoptosis in these cells [ 19 ] . Thus,
        different classes of conjugated bile acids stimulate
        distinctive responses in McNtcp cells. Whereas
        taurine-conjugated bile acids are well tolerated,
        glycine-conjugated bile acids are extremely cytotoxic. Here
        we examined if this differential response is limited to
        cells that normally metabolize bile acids, and whether high
        level expression of an intracellular bile acid binding
        protein can attenuate the cytotoxic response of McNtcp.24
        cells to glycine-conjugated bile acids.
      
      
        Results
        
          Differential cytotoxicity of glycine-conjugated
          bile acids in McNtcp.24 cells
          We previously showed that taurine-conjugated bile
          acids, such as taurocholic (TCA) and
          taurochenodeoxycholic (TCDCA) acids, were well tolerated
          by McNtcp.24 cells [ 18 ] . In contrast,
          glycine-conjugated bile acids, such as glycocholic (GCA)
          and glycochenodeoxycholic (GCDCA) acids, were cytotoxic
          to McNtcp.24 cells [ 1 ] concordant with what has been
          documented in hepatocytes [ 19 ] . Consistent with the
          induction of apoptotic cell death; GCDCA, but not TCA,
          preferentially induced the activation of the initiator
          caspase 8 in McNtcp.24 cells (Figure 1A). Indeed,
          glycine-conjugated bile acids as a class of molecules
          induced genomic DNA fragmentation in this cell line at
          low concentrations (50 μM), while their taurine
          counterparts did not (Figure 1B). The cytotoxicity of
          glycine-conjugated bile acids cannot be attributed simply
          to the preferential cellular accumulation of these bile
          acids because McNtcp.24 cells can accumulate GCA and TCA
          to similar levels (Torchia and Agellon, unpublished
          observations).
          There is considerable evidence to suggest that bile
          acids activate a variety of cellular signaling pathways
          in liver cells [ 20 ] . TCDCA is capable of activating
          PI3K activity in McNtcp.24 cells and, direct elevation of
          PI3K activity by transient expression of a plasmid
          encoding PI3K can protect McNtcp.24 cells from
          GCDCA-induced apoptosis [ 21 ] . TCA, like TCDCA, also
          caused the elevation of PI3K activity in McNtcp.24 cells
          (Figure 2A), suggesting that activation of PI3K may be a
          general response to taurine-conjugated bile acids.
          Treatment of McNtpc.24 cells with LY294002, a PI3K
          inhibitor, prior to the addition of TCA or TCDCA resulted
          in the loss of tolerance to these bile acids as
          demonstrated by the activation of caspase 8 (Figure 2B).
          On the other hand, preincubation of McNtcp.24 cells with
          either TCA or TCDCA attenuated the GCDCA-mediated
          activation of caspase 8 (Figure 2C), suggesting that the
          activation of a PI3K-dependent survival pathway is
          dominant over the death pathway. These results also
          indicate that the differential sensitivity of the
          liver-derived McNtcp.24 cells to conjugated bile acids is
          due to the existence of a specific mechanism that is
          capable of recognizing different classes of conjugated
          bile acids. In these cells, taurine-conjugated bile acids
          specifically increase PI3K activity which, in turn, leads
          to the activation of a survival pathway [ 22 23 ] .
        
        
          Expression of bile acid uptake activity in CHO
          cells
          To determine if non-liver derived cells also posses
          differential sensitivity to bile acid-induced
          cytotoxicity, we engineered CHO cells to take up bile
          acids actively by expressing asbt. Colonies surviving the
          selection process were assayed for asbt activity and
          several clones showing a range of bile acid uptake
          activities were selected for further analysis. Analysis
          of total RNA from the selected clones (CHO.asbt) readily
          showed the presence of the recombinant asbt mRNA (Figure
          3A). Correspondingly, in CHO.asbt lysates, an
          immunoreactive band of comparable size (~45 kDa) to rat
          asbt protein can be easily detected using an anti-asbt
          antibody (Figure 3B). The uptake of bile acids by the
          CHO.asbt cells was saturable with an apparent K 
          m ranging between 22 to 25 μM (Figure
          3C). The V 
          max values ranged from 0.323 to 2.769
          nmol/mg protein/min and correlated with the abundance of
          the recombinant asbt mRNA encoded by the transgene. The
          uptake of 25 μM TCA by CHO.asbt.8 and CHO.asbt.35 cells
          reached steady state within 10 min (Figure 3D), implying
          the presence of a pathway for bile acid efflux in CHO
          cells. Furthermore, it was possible to chase the
          incorporated radiolabeled TCA from CHO.asbt.49 and
          CHO.asbt.35 cells (Figure 3E). These results demonstrate
          that CHO.asbt cells express a fully functional asbt
          protein.
        
        
          Cytotoxic potential of bile acids in CHO.asbt.35
          cells
          The increase of LDH activity in the culture medium of
          CHO.asbt.35 and McNtcp.24 cells after treatment with
          glycine- and taurine-conjugated bile acids were compared
          to assess the cytotoxic potential of bile acids on these
          cells. The CHO.asbt.35 cell line was chosen for this
          study because this cell line has bile acid uptake
          activity that was comparable to McNtcp.24 cells [ 17 ] .
          LDH activity in the culture medium of McNtcp.24 cells
          increased by 20 to 31% within 2 h of incubating the cells
          in medium containing 100 μM of glycine conjugates of
          cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, and deoxycholic acid
          (GCA, GCDCA, GDCA, respectively) (Figure 4A). GCDCA was
          the most potent in inducing the release of LDH among the
          bile acids tested whereas TCA had little effect as
          compared to the no addition controls. In contrast,
          incubation of CHO.asbt.35 cells in medium containing 100
          μM of taurine- or glycine-conjugated bile acids resulted
          in a time dependent increase of LDH activity the culture
          medium (Figure 4B). GCA and GCDCA were equally potent in
          increasing LDH activity, raising the level in the medium
          of treated cells by 40% within 6 h. Taurine-conjugated
          bile acids also raised the LDH activity in the medium of
          treated cells to levels approaching GDCA-treated cells
          (Figure 4B). Treatment of McArdle RH-7777 and CHO cells
          with taurine- or glycine-conjugated bile acids had little
          effect on the release of LDH (Figure 4Cand 4D),
          indicating that bile acid uptake activity is necessary to
          manifest their cytotoxic potential in both cell lines. In
          addition, the cytotoxicity was specific to conjugated
          bile acids since the addition of non-conjugated bile
          acids to the culture medium of bile acid-transporting
          cells had a negligible effect on the release of LDH into
          the culture medium.
        
        
          Mechanism of cell death
          Members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases
          have been implicated in the initiation and execution
          phase of apoptosis [ 24 ] . In addition, several studies
          have shown the activation of the caspase cascade by toxic
          bile acids in hepatocytes [ 25 26 ] . We thus measured
          caspase activity after bile acid treatment in CHO.asbt.35
          cells. Activation of caspase 8 was detected in
          CHO.asbt.35 cells after treatment with either taurine- or
          glycine- conjugated bile acids (Figure 5A), but absent in
          bile acid-treated CHO cells (Figures 5A). Analysis of
          genomic DNA isolated from treated cells showed that TCA
          and GCDCA induced DNA laddering in CHO.asbt.35 cells
          (Figure 5B), indicating that both classes of conjugated
          bile acids induce apoptosis in this non-hepatic derived
          cell line. To further characterize the initiation of the
          caspase cascade, we determined the time course of caspase
          activation by bile acids in CHO.asbt.35 and McNtcp.24
          cells. Activation of caspase 8 in both cell lines was
          first detected by 30 min following GCDCA-treatment and
          was maximal by 60 min (Figure 6). In contrast,
          TCA-mediated activation of caspase 8 was first detected
          at 60 min and reached the levels induced by GCDCA by 120
          min.
          Because the bile acid transporters used to establish
          bile acid uptake activity in McNtcp.24 and CHO.asbt.35
          cells were not the same, it was possible that the
          sensitivity of CHO.asbt.35 cells to taurine-conjugated
          bile acids was a consequence of asbt expression. To
          address this possibility, asbt was expressed in McArdle
          RH-7777 cells and then tested for response to glycine-
          and taurine-conjugated bile acids. As shown in Figure 7A,
          asbt conferred active bile acid uptake activity in
          transfected cells. However, activation of caspase 8 was
          evident only in the cells that were treated with GCDCA
          (Figure 7B). These results demonstrate that the
          sensitivity of this cell line to taurine- and
          glycine-conjugated bile acids is not dependent on a
          specific kind of bile acid transporter.
          Activation of a PI3K-dependent pathway by
          taurine-conjugated bile acids appears to decide the fate
          of McNtcp.24 cells (Figure 2and ref. [ 21 ] ). Therefore,
          we determined if PI3K activity was altered in bile
          acid-treated CHO.asbt.35 cells. As shown in Figure 8,
          PI3K activity in response to TCA or GCDCA was not evident
          in CHO.asbt.35 cells, suggesting that the inability to
          activate survival pathways by taurine-conjugated bile
          acids commit these cells to apoptosis. These findings
          also indicate that liver derived cells posses a mechanism
          that responds to taurine-conjugated bile acids leading to
          the activation of PI3K.
        
        
          Cytotoxic potential of bile acids in
          HBAB-expressing McNtcp.24 cells
          It has been suggested that sequestration of bile acids
          by intracellular bile acid binding proteins may also
          protect cells from bile acid cytotoxicity. Thus, the
          human bile acid binder (HBAB) was expressed in McNtcp.24
          cells to determine if this class of proteins can protect
          against GCDCA cytotoxicity. Figure 9Ashows the presence
          of the recombinant mRNA encoding the recombinant HBAB in
          clones that have incorporated the HBAB expression vector
          into their genomes. In addition, the HBAB protein
          abundance in the total lysates correlated with the
          abundance of the HBAB mRNA (Figure 9A). Analysis of
          radiolabeled TCA uptake (Figure 9B) showed that
          expression of HBAB had minimal impact on bile acid uptake
          despite the fact that the range of HBAB protein abundance
          was up to 5-fold greater than that in the lowest HBAB
          expressing cell. Moreover, the rates of decline in the
          amount of radiolabeled TCA associated with the cells
          after withdrawal of the radiolabeled bile acids from the
          culture medium was comparable among the different clones
          (Figure 9C), indicating that the rate of bile acid efflux
          from these cells was also not affected by the presence of
          HBAB.
          Incubation of the BN clones with GCDCA increased the
          LDH activity in the culture medium to a level similar to
          that in the medium of GCDCA-treated McNtcp.24 cells
          (Figure 10A). In addition, caspase 8 activity in bile
          acid-treated BN.25, BN.46 and BN.49 was comparable to
          that in McNtcp.24, which were elevated compared to that
          in McArdle RH-7777 cells (Figure 10B). The time course of
          caspase 8 activation in BN cells after treatment with 10
          μM bile acids was similar to that observed for McNtcp.24
          cells (Figure 10C). Therefore, the presence of an
          intracellular bile acid binding protein did not protect
          these cells from glycine-conjugated bile acid
          cytotoxicity, even at low bile acid concentrations. These
          results indicate that the activation of a signaling
          cascade involving PI3K is the dominant mechanism
          responsible for protecting McNtcp.24 cells from the
          cytotoxicity of glycine-conjugated bile acids.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study, we determined if the differential
        sensitivity elaborated by the liver-derived McNtcp.24 cell
        line to different classes of conjugated bile acids is
        limited to cells that normally transport bile acids. We
        previously demonstrated that taurine-conjugated bile acids
        are not toxic to McNtcp.24 cells [ 18 ] . In contrast,
        glycine-conjugated bile acids induce apoptosis in McNtcp.24
        cells and primary mouse hepatocytes, through activation of
        the Fas receptor in a FasL-independent manner [ 19 25 ] .
        Moreover, GCDCA was demonstrated to activate both initiator
        and effector caspases, and that the apoptotic response can
        be blocked by Crm A, a caspase 8 inhibitor [ 25 ] . The
        mechanism by which bile acids stimulate the activation of
        Fas receptor remains unclear. In Fas deficient hepatocytes,
        toxic bile acids were still able to induce apoptosis,
        suggesting that bile acids are capable of stimulating
        multiple pathways to initiate cell death [ 26 ] .
        To gain further insight into the specificity of bile
        acid cytotoxicity, we conferred active bile acid uptake
        capacity in CHO cells, a cell type that does not normally
        metabolize bile acids, by expressing a bile acid
        transporter. CHO.asbt cells produce recombinant asbt with a
        molecular mass and kinetic parameters that are similar to
        previously reported values [ 6 ] . It is not known if CHO
        cells have pathways capable of facilitating the efflux of
        bile acids out of the cell. The apparent efflux observed in
        CHO.asbt.35 could be attributed to the fact that asbt is
        capable a bidirectional transport of bile acids [ 27 ] .
        However, it is conceivable that an efflux mechanism that
        recognizes bile acids exists in CHO cells and other
        mammalian cells. Indeed, yeast and plants express proteins
        capable of active bile acid transport [ 28 ] . As these
        organisms do not normally synthesize bile acids, their
        ability to transport bile acids may illustrate a
        generalized mechanism for cellular transport of hydrophobic
        organic anions.
        CHO.asbt.35 cells were used as a model to assess the
        cytotoxic potential of taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile
        acids in non-hepatic derived and non-bile acid metabolizing
        cells. Unlike McNtcp.24 cells, treatment of CHO.asbt clones
        with taurine-conjugated bile acids resulted in cell death.
        TCA was the most potent of taurine-conjugated bile acid
        tested. It is unlikely that the observed cytotoxicity of
        the conjugated bile acids could be attributed to the
        generalized intracellular accumulation of bile acids
        because unconjugated bile acids were transported by
        CHO.asbt cells but did not cause significant release of LDH
        into the culture medium (Torchia and Agellon, unpublished
        observations). In contrast, glycine-conjugated bile acids
        (GCDCA in particular) were highly effective at causing the
        increase in LDH activity in the culture medium of both
        McNtcp.24 and CHO.asbt.35 cells. Primary hepatocytes
        exhibit differential sensitivity to taurine- and
        glycine-conjugated bile acids in culture [ 29 ] . The bile
        acid-transporting WIF-B cells, which are rat hepatoma-human
        fibroblast hybrids [ 30 ] , remain viable even when grown
        in TCA-containing culture medium for up to 14 days [ 31 ] .
        In contrast, our study shows that taurine-conjugated bile
        acids is toxic to a cell type that is not normally exposed
        to bile acids. Liver cells, which normally metabolize bile
        acids, apparently possess a mechanism that can distinguish
        and differentially elaborate distinct biological activities
        of taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids.
        Both taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids induce
        apoptotic cell death in CHO.asbt.35 cells. The involvement
        of the caspase cascade in CHO.asbt.35 cells was illustrated
        by the fact that conjugated bile acids activated caspase 8
        in a time dependent manner. However, the different profile
        of caspase 8 activation suggests that taurine- and
        glycine-conjugated bile acids may trigger apoptosis by
        different pathways. At present, it is not known how
        conjugated bile acids activate caspases in CHO.asbt.35
        cells. A protein that is immunoreactive to a Fas receptor
        antiserum and has a molecular mass similar to the rat Fas
        receptor is detectable in CHO cell extracts (Torchia and
        Agellon, unpublished results). This leaves the possibility
        that conjugated bile acids may activate the apoptotic
        cascade through Fas receptor in this cell line, as
        glycine-conjugated bile acids do in hepatocytes [ 25 ] .
        However, the activation of caspases does not require a
        specific kind of bile acid transporter since TCA is not
        toxic to McArdle RH-7777 cells irrespective of whether
        these cells internalize bile acids via ntcp or asbt.
        The differential response of McNtcp.24 cells to
        different classes of conjugated bile acids is apparently
        due to the selective activation of either a PI3K-dependent
        survival pathway [ 22 23 ] or caspase-dependent death
        pathway [ 32 ] . Indeed, neither taurine- nor
        glycine-conjugated bile acids stimulated PI3K activity in
        CHO.asbt.35 cells and both classes of bile acids were
        toxic. In addition, pre-treatment of McNtcp.24 cells with a
        PI3K inhibitor rendered these cells susceptible to TCA- and
        TCDCA- mediated cell death. The latter finding indicates
        that taurine-conjugated bile acids are capable of inducing
        apoptosis when PI3K is inhibited, probably by utilizing the
        same mechanism activated by glycine-conjugated bile acids.
        That TCA is able to activate PI3K in plasma membrane
        fractions from McNtpc.24 agrees with a previous study
        showing that TCA increases PI3K activity in canalicular and
        sinusoidal membrane vesicles [ 16 ] . The activation of
        PI3K in that report was also associated with recruitment of
        sister of P-glycoprotein (the bile acid export pump) and
        other multidrug resistance proteins to the canalicular
        membrane [ 16 ] . Extended treatment of McNtcp.24 cells
        does not appear to have detrimental and permanent
        consequences on cellular function. The marked morphological
        changes that occur during long term incubation with TCA [
        18 ] dissipate after the withdrawal of the bile acid from
        the culture medium, and the cells remain viable.
        The significance of an intracellular and high affinity
        bile acid binder in bile acid mediated cytotoxicity was
        also evaluated. Several proteins capable of binding bile
        acids in vitro have been identified (reviewed in ref. [ 1 ]
        ). It is thought that the major bile acid binding protein
        in the cytosol of rat hepatocytes is 3α-hydroxysteroid
        dehydrogenase, a member of the aldo keto reductase
        supergene family [ 33 ] . However, the exact role of this
        protein in intracellular transport of bile acids and
        cytoprotection was undefined. HBAB, a member of the human
        aldo keto reductase gene family, has been shown to bind
        bile acids with high affinity (<1 μM) and is postulated
        to play a similar role as 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
        in human hepatocytes [ 33 ] . Expression of HBAB in
        McNtcp.24 cells was expected to increase the capacity of
        these cells to sequester bile acids in the cytoplasm, and
        thereby reduce their toxicity. High level expression of
        HBAB had a negligible effect on the ability of the BN
        clones to take up or secrete bile acids, suggesting that
        HBAB has a minor role in the net transport of bile acids in
        these cells. More importantly however, expression of HBAB
        in McNtcp.24 cells had no effect on GCDCA-induced cell
        death, even at low bile acid concentrations, indicating
        that this class of protein does not provide cytoprotection
        against toxic bile acids as previously suspected. This
        finding is consistent with the idea that bile acids
        directly modulate specific signaling cascades that control
        cellular death and survival.
        In summary, the failure of CHO.asbt cells to tolerate
        taurine-conjugated bile acids has revealed the existence of
        a mechanism that may be specific for cells that normally
        metabolize bile acids. Since bile acids undergo
        enterohepatic circulation, it would be reasonable to expect
        the existence of the same mechanism in other cell types
        that naturally transport bile acids, such as ileocytes and
        cholangiocytes [ 34 35 ] . The last few years have brought
        significant advances in our understanding of bile acid
        transport in liver and intestinal cells. However, the
        regulatory potential of bile acids is only beginning to be
        realized. With the recent discovery that bile acids
        represent the natural ligands for the nuclear receptor FXR
        [ 10 11 12 ] , there is heightened interest in identifying
        the genes that are regulated by bile acids. Insight into
        how bile acids directly modulate a variety of other
        cellular functions will be important in understanding the
        significance of cellular responses to bile acids.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Materials
          Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Canadian
          Life Technologies (Burlington, ON, Canada). [
          3H]-Taurocholic acid (2.6 Ci/mmol), [ 32P]-dCTP (3000
          Ci/mmol), and [ 32P]-ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased
          from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Baie d'Urfe, QC,
          Canada). Bile acids were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
          Canada Ltd. (Oakville, ON, Canada) and
          Calbiochem-NovaBiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA, USA). Other
          reagents purchased from various commercial suppliers were
          of analytical grade.
        
        
          Cell lines
          McNtcp.24 cells were cultured as described previously
          [17]. Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells were cultured in
          Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
          serum. To establish cell lines stably expressing asbt, a
          cDNA encoding the hamster asbt [ 36 ] was cloned into
          pBK-CMV expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The
          prokaryotic promoter embedded in the 5'-untranslated
          region of the encoded recombinant eukaryotic mRNA was
          removed from the resulting plasmid. The human bile acid
          binder (HBAB) cDNA [ 37 ] was cloned into a derivative of
          pCep4 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), that had been
          previously modified by deleting the EBNA 1 gene [ 38 ] .
          The lipofectamine reagent (Canadian Life Technologies)
          was used to transfect the expression plasmid into CHO,
          McArdle RH7777, and McNtcp.24 cells. The cell medium was
          replaced 24 h post-transfection with medium containing
          G418 (400 μg/ml) or hygromycin (500 μg/ml) to select for
          stable transfectants. Surviving colonies were expanded
          and assayed for the ability to take up [ 3H]-TCA from the
          culture medium as described previously [ 17 ] or assayed
          for the expression of HBAB by immunoblotting.
        
        
          RNA and immunoblot analyses
          Total RNA from CHO.asbt and BN cells was prepared and
          analyzed by RNA blotting as previously described [ 17 ] .
          Cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells in 50 mM
          Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% NP-40%, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate;
          150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na 
          3 VO 
          4 , 1 mM sodium fluoride, containing a
          protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd.).
          The lysates were fractionated by polyacrylamide gel
          electrophoresis and then transferred to Immobilon-P
          membrane (Millipore Ltd., Nepean, ON). Asbt was detected
          using a rabbit antiserum directed against the last 14
          amino acids of the carboxyl terminal of the hamster asbt
          protein. HBAB protein was detected as previously
          described [ 37 ] .
        
        
          Bile acid uptake activity assay
          Uptake studies in CHO.asbt, BN and McNtcp.24 cells
          were done as previously described [ 17 ] . Protein
          content was determined using the Bradford method [ 39 ]
          with bovine serum albumin as the standard.
        
        
          Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay
          Cells (10 4per well) were grown on 24 well multiwell
          plates for 16 h. The cells were then washed with
          phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated in
          medium (Ham's F12 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
          (DMEM)) containing 100 μM bile acids for 1 to 5 h as
          detailed in the Figure legends. The media was collected
          and adjusted to 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells remaining on the
          dish were dissolved in medium (Ham's F12 or DMEM)
          containing 0.1% Triton X-100. LDH activities in both the
          cell lysates and media were measured as described
          previously [ 40 ] .
        
        
          Visualization of genomic DNA fragmentation
          Cells (10 6per 60 mm dish) were grown for 16 h. After
          washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with 50 μM
          bile acids for 3 h at 37°C. Adherent and non-adherent
          cells were dissolved in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6)
          containing 10 mM EDTA and 0.5% sarkosyl, and 1 mg/ml
          proteinase K. After digestion (~16 h) of cellular
          proteins at 55°C, DNA was sequentially extracted with
          phenol/chloroform and chloroform. The DNA was
          precipitated, washed in 70% ethanol, and dissolved in
          buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.5) and 1 mM EDTA.
          The isolated DNA was treated with RNase A and then
          analyzed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis [ 41
          ] . DNA was visualized with ultraviolet light after
          ethidium bromide staining.
        
        
          Caspase activity assays
          Cells (10 6per 60 mm dish) were grown for 16 h. After
          washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with 50 to 100
          μM bile acids for 1 to 2 h. After the incubation period,
          the medium was discarded and adherent cells were
          harvested in PBS and sedimented by centrifugation (500 ×
          g). The cells were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mM
          Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, and 150 mM NaCl.
          Following 10 min incubation on ice, lysed cells were
          centrifuged for 10 min, 10,000 × g at 4°C. The
          supernatant was assayed for caspase activity in 20 mM
          Piperazine-N,N'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (pH 6.8), 100
          mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% CHAPS, and 10% sucrose with
          Z-IETD-AFC for caspase 8 [ 42 43 ] . The release of the
          fluorogenic-leaving group was detected by excitation at
          400 nm and emission at 505 nm. Free AFC was used to
          generate standard curve.
        
        
          PI3K activity assay
          Crude membrane fractions were isolated from CHO.asbt
          and McNtcp.24 cells as described previously [ 44 ] . To
          prepare lipid suspension, phosphatidylserine and
          phosphatidylinositol (1:1) were sonicated in 25 mM
          3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS; pH 7.0), 1 mM
          EGTA, 1 mM Na 
          3 VO 
          4 . Cell extracts were assayed in 25
          mM MOPS (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl 
          2 , 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na 
          3 VO 
          4 , 130 μM ATP, 20 μCi [ 32P]-ATP
          (3000 Ci/mmol) and 0.2 mg/ml sonicated lipids. The
          reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37°C and
          stopped by addition of 300 μl of 1N HCl:methanol (1:1).
          Lipids were extracted twice with 350 μl chloroform and
          the organic phases from both extractions were combined
          then washed once with 700 μl 1 N HCl/methanol (1:1).
          Lipids were dried, and then taken up in
          chloroform:methanol (1:1). The samples were spotted along
          with pure phosphoinositol phosphate standards (Avanti
          Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) onto 1.2% potassium
          oxalate impregnated TLC plates [ 45 ] . The chromatogram
          was developed in chloroform: methanol: water: aqueous
          ammonia (90:70:17:3) [ 46 ] . The incorporation of [ 32P]
          into phosphatidylinositol was quantitated by
          phosphorimaging using a Fuji BAS1000 phosphorimager.
          Visualization of standards was done by dippingTLC plates
          in 10% CuSO 
          4 ,10% H 
          3 PO 
          4 and heating at 200°C for 10 min.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Each set of experiments was repeated at least twice.
          The data is represented by means ± SD. Differences
          between control and test cells were evaluated by a
          Student's 
          t test. Differences in the slope of
          regression lines were evaluated by analysis of variance.
          P values of <0.05 were considered statistically
          significant.
