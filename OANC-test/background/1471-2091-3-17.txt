        The saturation status of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) is
        relevant to understanding the pathophysiology of jaundice
        and to interpreting experiments with UCB [ 1 ] . UCB, in
        its diacid form (H 
        2  B), has a low solubility (S 
        o  ) of 51 nM in water [ 2 ] . The total
        solubility (S) at any pH is determined by S 
        o  , pK 
        
          a  
          values, and pH [ 2 ] :
        S = [H 
        2  B] + [HB -] + [B =] = S 
        o  ·(1 + K

        a  2  / [H +] 2)     ( 
        Eq. 1  )
        Self-association of UCB dianion, B =, can also increase
        S [ 2 ] .
        Beginning in 1995, a series of papers reported the use
        of 13C-NMR to study the ionization of a close analogue of
        bilirubin-IXα, mesobilirubin-XIIIα (MBR), along with
        several soluble reference acids, in buffered mixtures of (C
        2H 
        3  ) 
        2  SO and water [ 3 4 5 6 7 ] . Due to
        the very low aqueous solubility of MBR, data were obtained
        only at two high concentrations of (C 2H 
        3  ) 
        2  SO (64 and 27 vol%). Its pK 
        
          a  
          values in "water" (actually in 1 vol% of ((C 2H 
        3  ) 
        2  SO), obtained by an extrapolation
        procedure based on the behavior of soluble reference acids,
        were 4.2 and 4.9, far lower than values of 8.12 and 8.44
        obtained by solvent partition between chloroform and
        buffered aqueous solutions [ 2 ] .
        These serious discrepancies led us to reexamine several
        experimental aspects of the 13C-NMR studies and the
        implications of their purported low pK 
        
          a  
          values for the solubility of UCB. Inaccuracies in the
        measurements of buffer pH and of the pK 
        
          a  
          values of the reference 13C-carboxylic acids, related
        to failure to correct for the strong effects of DMSO on the
        pK 
        
          a  
          values of weak acids, have been previously noted [ 8 ]
        and acknowledged [ 9 ] . In addition, as discussed later, a
        thermodynamic theory about solubility in mixed solvents,
        using the S 
        o  values of 51 nM in water [ 2 ] and 10
        mM in pure DMSO [ 10 ] , suggested that S 
        o  of UCB would be only about 0.15 μM in
        27 vol% DMSO and 2.2 μM in 64 vol% DMSO, which are well
        below concentrations used in the MBR studies. This implies
        serious supersaturation effects. In fact, turbidity was
        reported for some of the systems used in the 13C-NMR papers
        [ 4 ] , indicating the formation of coarse suspensions. By
        definition, as stressed in the Conclusions section, pK 
        
          a  
          determinations are valid only for monomeric species
        and require that solutions are below saturation at all pH
        values studied. Even reversible aggregation of monomers in
        undersaturated solutions is known to affect pK 
        
          a  
          estimates [ 2 ] . If supersaturation leads to the
        formation of fine sols or coarse suspensions, the data are
        unacceptable for determination of the pK 
        
          a  
          values of monomers.
        In the present paper, we assess whether some of the
        systems used in the 13C-NMR studies were supersaturated
        with MBR. Our experimental work on sedimentation was done
        with unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and we used DMSO instead
        of its deuterated analogue, (C 2H 
        3  ) 
        2  SO. It is known that, when alkaline
        aqueous UCB is acidified to neutral or low pH's, "Usually a
        colloid suspension of bilirubin is formed and the solution
        remains clear, as observed by the naked eye, thus inviting
        an erroneous interpretation" [ 11 ] . Such systems, which
        simulate true solutions, often show sedimentation on
        centrifugation [ 12 13 14 15 16 ] . We here report that
        sedimentation of UCB from apparently clear solutions can
        likewise be extensive when UCB in DMSO is diluted with
        aqueous buffers to final mole fractions (N) of DMSO =
        0.025, 0.086 and 0.31, corresponding to 9, 27, and 64 vol%
        of DMSO. A thermodynamic theory is used to examine the
        effect of added DMSO on S 
        o  . Our findings, consistent with our
        partition-derived S 
        o  , S and pK 
        
          a  
          values of UCB in aqueous buffers [ 2 ] , indicate that
        the recently reported low pK 
        
          a  
          values of MBR in comparable (C 2H 
        3  ) 
        2  SO -water systems [ 3 4 5 6 ] , were
        determined above saturation.
      
      
        Results
        
          Residual UCB in the supernatants after
          centrifugation
          Many systems initially appeared optically clear, but
          well over 90% of initial UCB sedimented on centrifugation
          of most samples below pH 7.2. Overall recoveries (UCB in
          supernatant + UCB in redissolved precipitate) were
          between 90 and 100%. Only residual [UCB] in supernatants
          are reported.
          Figs. 1A,1B,1Cplot the measured residual [UCB] in the
          supernatant vs. the initial [UCB] at N 
          DMSO  = 0.31, 0.086 and 0.025.
          Deviations of their ratio below unity (dotted lines)
          represent a decrease in [UCB], mainly from precipitation,
          but possibly also from limited degradation. At N = 0.31
          (Fig. 1A), [UCB] after sedimentation varied from 2.8 μM
          at pH 5.86 to 166 μM at pH 8.38. At N = 0.086 (Fig. 1B),
          [UCB] ranged from 0.3 to 2.4 μM at pH 4.50 and from 1.4
          to 6.4 μM at pH 7.05 and most of the UCB sedimented. By
          contrast, at pH 7.56 and 7.70 (phosphate), only minor
          precipitation was observed. At N = 0.025 (Fig. 1C); [UCB]
          ranged from 0.1 to 2.7 μM at all three pH values (4.15 to
          7.18).
        
        
          Sedimentation of bilirubin-albumin complexes
          The supernatant from the original supersaturated
          UCB-HSA system, when diluted with 1/8th vol. of buffer
          and centrifuged again, showed more sedimentation and a
          progressive rise in [UCB] as one moved down the column of
          fluid. By contrast, after dilution with 1/8th volume of
          DMSO to decrease UCB saturation, the supernatants
          produced no further sedimentation and there were no
          significant differences in [UCB] or protein
          concentrations along the axis of the fluid column. Thus,
          the UCB-HSA complex, which constitutes over 99.9% of the
          UCB in this system [ 17 ] , did not sediment.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Findings and their relation to thermodynamic
          theory
          Supersaturated aqueous systems of UCB, that are
          optically clear before centrifugation, may exhibit
          considerable variation in the extent of sedimentation [
          12 13 14 18 ] . Although sedimentation is often
          extensive, it is generally incomplete and may not be
          observed at all. Our data in DMSO-water show the same
          features, which are expected from the complex kinetics of
          nucleation and growth of insoluble aggregates of UCB
          diacid (H 
          2  B), leading to the formation of a
          new solid phase [ 19 20 ] . Our centrifugation, 5 min at
          14,000 
          g  , was quite mild, and the short
          20-minute period between preparation of UCB-DMSO-water
          systems and centrifugation severely limited the
          time-dependent growth to large aggregates. Lack of
          sedimentation of the UCB-HSA complex (mol. wt. 68,000)
          indicates that fine colloids composed of 100 UCB
          molecules would be too small to sediment. Thus,
          supersaturated systems lacking coarse, insoluble
          aggregates may not show sedimentation, but any
          sedimentation observed indicates their presence.
          To evaluate the important effect of pH on
          sedimentation efficiency, we calculated S in water using
          chloroform-water partition data on UCB and the best
          measure of S 
          o  in chloroform, 0.88 mM [ 2 ] . S at
          any pH, e.g. 62 nM at pH 7.4 and 0.32 μM at pH 8.5, can
          be calculated from the fitted partition data, or,
          equivalently, from Eq. 1, using the partition-derived S 
          o  in water of 51 nM and pK 
          
            a  
            values of 8.12 and 8.44 [ 2 ] . In aqueous systems [
          12 ] , the lowest [UCB] in water, below which no
          sedimentation was observed at 100,000 × 
          g  for a few hours, was 100 nM at pH
          7.4, modestly higher than our partition-derived S of 62
          nM [ 2 ] . Even under such vigorous centrifugation, the
          lowest [UCB] increased rapidly with increasing pH, to 17
          μM (150 times S) at pH 8.05 and 34 μM (230 times S) at pH
          8.2 [ 12 ] . This indicates increasing
          charge-stabilization of fine, non-sedimenting colloids of
          H 
          2  B by adsorbed UCB anions [ 12 19 20
          ] . In contrast, below pH 6.7, sedimentation of 10 μM UCB
          was nearly complete [ 13 ] . This is compatible with a
          dearth of stabilizing UCB anions at this pH, as expected
          from the high pK 
          
            a  
            values of 8.12 and 8.44 [ 2 ] .
          Our present data on residual [UCB] in DMSO-water
          systems likewise show decreased sedimentation with
          increasing pH (Fig. 1A,1B,1C). At each N 
          DMSO  , the lowest [UCB] were at the
          lowest pH values: 0.1 μM (N = 0.025, pH 4.15); 0.3 μM (N
          = 0.086, pH 4.5); and 2.8 &#956;M (N = 0.31, pH 5.9).
          As in water, these are likely to be closest to the S 
          o  values at each N. Indeed, they are
          only moderately higher than the corresponding S 
          o  values of 0.07 μM, 0.15 μM and 2.2
          μM, respectively, calculated from Equation 2 using S 
          o  values of 51 nM in water [ 2 ] and
          10 mM in DMSO [ 10 ] .

          o,water  + (log S 
          o,DMSO  - log S 
          o,water  ) × N     ( 
          Eq. 2  )
          Equation 2 is a thermodynamic relationship based on
          assumptions of complete ideality of mixing [ 21 ] . In
          general, a roughly linear variation of log S 
          o  with N at low N is expected. For
          example, data from 1-naphthoic acid in DMSO-water [ 22 ]
          show that log S 
          o  is a linear function of N up to N =
          0.35. Such a relationship leads to a relatively small
          effect of low N values on S 
          o  . Thus, according to Equation 2, S 
          o  increases by a factor of only 1.4 at
          N = 0.025 and 2.9 at N = 0.086, but by a relatively
          larger factor of 44 at N = 0.31. This would markedly
          reduce the supersaturation factor ([UCB]/ S 
          o  ), which is a measure of the
          tendency of UCB to come out of solution at N = 0.31. This
          explains in part the relatively high [UCB] at high pH at
          N = 0.31 (Fig. 1A).
          The pH effects on [UCB] at each N 
          DMSO  are of interest also. The lowest
          [UCB] at each pH registered relatively small increases
          with significant increases in pH: for example from 0.1 μM
          (pH 4.14) to 0.2 μM (pH 7.0) at N = 0.025; from 0.3 μM
          (pH 4.5) to 1.4 μM (pH 7.1) at N = 0.086; and from 111 μM
          (pH 7.1) to 166 μM (pH 8.4) at N = 0.31. These increases
          are probably caused mainly by increasing
          charge-stabilization of colloidal aggregates, as in
          aqueous media [ 12 19 20 ] . If, instead, the relatively
          small increases are ascribed entirely to increases in
          true solubility (S) at the high pH (Eq. 1), the required
          pK 
          
            a  
            values are about 7 at N = 0.025 and 0.086, and 8.5
          at N = 0.31. The true pK 
          
            a  
            s of UCB in DMSO-water are thus probably
          significantly higher.
          We note that some variability in sedimentation results
          from our short-term experiments, most evident at the low
          residual [UCB] in Figs. 1Band 1C, in part magnified by
          the log-log scale used. Some variability is expected,
          however, because of the complexity of the kinetic
          processes of nucleation, growth and flocculation that
          precede sedimentation. In Fig. 1A, the difference between
          acetate and Tris buffers is quite small (note the linear
          scale), compatible with the 58% higher [H +] in the
          acetate buffer. In Fig. 1B, the markedly lower
          sedimentation from phosphate buffers at pH 7.6-7.7, as
          compared to Tris buffer at pH 7.1, can be ascribed mainly
          to the much higher pH values and ionic strength of the
          phosphate systems. Another significant factor may be the
          difference in charge between the buffer salts; phosphate
          is anionic whereas Tris is cationic and zwitterionic. The
          cationic species of Tris can, in principle, reduce the
          negative charges on the surface of the colloidal H 
          2  B sufficiently to facilitate the
          formation of coarser particles and, thus, increase
          sedimentation.
        
        
          Implications for pK a values of mesobilirubin-XIIIα
          (MBR)
          In the recent 13C-NMR studies of the ionization of the
          13C-COOH groups of MBR [ 3 4 5 6 ] , it was assumed that
          the relevant physical properties of UCB and MBR, and of
          (CH 
          3  ) 
          2  SO (DMSO) and (C 2H 
          3  ) 
          2  SO, are similar. Actually, as
          expected from the replacement of two vinyl groups in UCB
          with two ethyl groups in MBR, MBR is slightly more
          soluble in organic solvents [ 23 ] and has a higher R 
          f  on silica gel t.l.c. [ 24 ] ; MBR is
          thus more hydrophobic and should be less soluble in water
          than is UCB. Our low [UCB] in DMSO-water systems at
          comparable N, therefore, indicate that many of the (C 2H 
          3  ) 
          2  SO/buffer systems used in the
          13C-NMR studies [ 3 4 5 6 ] were likely supersaturated
          with MBR. In those studies, the MBR concentrations used
          were stated to be 1 to 100 μM at N = 0.086 [ 3 ] ,
          compared to our lowest [UCB] of 0.3 μM at pH 4.5 and 1.4
          μM at pH 7.05. At this N, 9 of 11 MBR data points were
          obtained at pH below 7.05 and 5 below pH 4.5 [ 4 ] , so
          that even 1 μM MBR was likely to be supersaturated. At N
          = 0.31, our lowest [UCB], 2.8 μM at pH 5.9, was close to
          the lower limit of the 2 to 800 μM range of [MBR] used [
          4 5 ] . Thus, many data points, obtained at pH values
          down to 2 [ 4 5 ] , were probably from supersaturated
          systems, despite being optically clear. As noted here and
          elsewhere [ 12 13 14 15 16 18 ] , optical clarity gives
          no assurance of the absence of supersaturation.
          Actually, turbidity was reported in some of the
          13C-NMR samples [ 4 ] , indicating that coarse, insoluble
          aggregates of MBR were present. The claim that such
          turbidity did not affect 13C-NMR measurements [ 3 5 6 ]
          contrasts with evidence that even small multimers can
          change NMR chemical shifts [ 25 26 ] . It should be noted
          also that, at high concentrations of B =, extensive,
          reversible self-association of B =can lead to apparently
          stable supersaturation with no separation of an insoluble
          phase [ 2 ] . For example, at pH 8.5 and a UCB
          concentration of 20 μM (63 times S), the weight-average
          aggregation number of UCB has been found to be 7.17 [ 18
          ] , corresponding to a molecular weight of 4,195. The
          aggregation number remained fairly high, 4.2, in 60%
          (w/v) ethanol [ 18 ] . The successful application of
          equilibrium ultracentrifugation for that study [ 18 ]
          suggests a complete absence of even small colloidal
          species of UCB. Self-association of MBR dianions in (C 2H
          
          3  ) 
          2  SO-water mixtures cannot be ruled
          out on 
          a priori  grounds. It has been shown
          that neglect of self-association of B =leads to an
          artefactually low estimate of pK 
          
            a  
            values for UCB [ 2 ] .
          In addition to the problems of insolubility,
          supersaturation and self-aggregation of the MBR systems
          in (C 2H 
          3  ) 
          2  SO-water [ 3 4 5 6 ] , we had shown
          previously that inaccuracies in the pH measurements
          affected both the magnitude of ΔpK 
          
            a  
            (the change in pK 
          
            a  
            on adding (C 2H 
          3  ) 
          2  SO to water), as well as the degree
          of the variation of ΔpK 
          
            a  
            with N [ 8 ] . This is important for extrapolating

            values in (C 2H 
          3  ) 
          2  SO-water to pure water (N = 0).
          Indeed, remeasurement of one soluble acid raised its pK 
          
            a  
            by as much as 3 units at N = 0.31 [ 9 ] . Thus, the
          inaccuracies in pH measurement produced serious errors in
          reported pK 
          
            a  
            values of more than fifteen soluble acids used as
          models for MBR, as well as for MBR itself [ 3 4 5 6 7 ]
          .
          Many methods, using appropriate pH measurements, have
          been applied in the past to determine thermodynamic pK 
          
            a  
            values of soluble acids in non-aqueous or partially
          aqueous media, including DMSO-water systems [ 27 28 ] .
          Many other relevant references were given in our prior
          paper [ 8 ] . In that paper, our pK 
          
            a  
            measurements on acetic acid in DMSO-water systems
          were based on the potentiometric method, using properly
          calibrated glass electrodes, which determine the activity
          of H +, and on estimates of the activity coefficients of
          the acetate ion. This method, which is well established
          for aqueous solutions, yielded results in good agreement
          with data from the literature that was based on a very
          different method, measurements of electrical conductivity
          [ 28 ] . In the 13C-NMR papers, therefore, it was not
          justified, to assume that pH values do not change on
          adding DMSO [ 3 4 5 6 7 ] , or to use uncalibrated pH
          measurements for determination of the pK 
          
            a  
            values of soluble acids [ 9 ] .
          Our sedimentation data and their interpretation
          indicate that significant additional uncertainties, not
          important for the soluble acids investigated, exist for
          the reported pK 
          
            a  
            values of the relatively insoluble MBR in (CD 
          3  ) 
          2  SO-water (4.2 and 4.9 at N = 0.086
          and 4.3 and 5.0 at N = 0.31), as well as their
          extrapolation to obtain pK 
          
            a  
            values of 4.2 and 4.9 in water [ 9 ] . Indeed, if
          these low aqueous pK 
          
            a  
            values, along with the experimental S values at pH
          8.5 of 0.32 μM [ 2 ] , or 0.6 μM [ 17 ] , are applied to
          Eq. 1, the calculated extremely low S 
          o  values of UCB diacid of 4 or 8 × 10
          -15M are seven orders of magnitude lower than the
          experimental S 
          o  , 5.1 × 10-8 M [ 2 ] . Applying the
          S 
          o  of 4 or 8 × 10 -15M to Eq. 2,
          moreover, would indicate massive supersaturation (up to 8
          to 10 orders of magnitude) of MBR at the concentrations
          (1-800 μM) used in the 13C-NMR studies [ 3 4 5 6 ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The present sedimentation data for UCB in DMSO-water
        demonstrate that the true solubilities of UCB, even at
        fairly high pH values, are low at DMSO mole fractions up to
        0.31. The results and related considerations are compatible
        with similar results in purely aqueous solutions [ 12 13 14
        ] , and support both the estimated solubility (S 
        o  ) of 5.1 × 10-8 M for uncharged UCB (H
        
        2  B) in water, and the corresponding
        high aqueous pK 
        
          a  
          values of 8.12 and 8.44, derived from our partition
        studies [ 2 ] . These were performed in undersaturated
        systems and took into account the self-association of B =.
        Our experimental data indicate problems of insolubility,
        supersaturation and self-aggregation of UCB in DMSO-water
        mixtures with compositions similar to the MBR systems in (C
        2H 
        3  ) 
        2  SO -water [ 3 4 5 6 ] . In (C 2H 
        3  )

        other medium [ 8 ] , properly determined pK

        2  A (H

        -<--> A =+ H +) must pertain to monomeric H 
        2  A, HA -and A =, the solute species
        involved in the stated equilibria, and require unambiguous
        determination of [H +] or pH. Unless pK 
        
          a  
          values are determined for monomeric systems, relative
        concentrations of H 
        2  A, HA -and A =cannot be determined
        from the pK 
        
          a  
          values and the pH. The 13C-NMR data, suggesting low pK

          values for MBR in (C 2H 
        3  ) 
        2  SO -water and water [ 3 4 5 6 9 ] ,
        did not meet these essential requirements of proper pH
        measurements [ 8 ] nor provide assurance that the MBR in
        every system was below saturation and not self-associated [
        2 ] . The issues raised are not trivial, since the pK 
        
          a  
          and S 
        o  values of UCB are clinically relevant
        to the effects of pH on the precipitation of calcium
        bilirubinates in pigment gallstones and the neurotoxicity
        caused by UCB diacid in severely jaundiced neonates [ 29 ]
        .
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Materials
          UCB (Calbiochem) was purified by alkaline extraction
          of a chloroform solution, recrystallized twice from
          chloroform-methanol [ 30 ] , dried under Argon, stored in
          
          vacuo  in the dark and used within 6
          weeks. DMSO was spectroscopic grade, 99.8% pure (UVASol,
          Merck). Human serum albumin (HSA, lot 903635) was from
          Calbiochem-Boehringer. All other chemicals were reagent
          grade (Merck). Water used was deionized and distilled.
          All flasks and tubes were Kimax glass, washed with 0.1 N
          HCl and rinsed 4X with water and then dried before use.
          Stock buffers, 1.0 M, were: Tris-HCl, pH 7.01; Na-
          phosphate, pH 6.85, or 6.99; and Na-acetate, pH 4.01.
          Stock UCB in DMSO (4 to 6 mM) and stock HSA, 613 μM in
          0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.01, were prepared freshly for
          each experiment.
        
        
          Preparation of UCB-DMSO-buffer systems
          Test systems (4.0 mL) of UCB were prepared in
          duplicate: to 0.4 mL of the stock buffer were added
          successively the appropriate volumes of water, DMSO and,
          finally, up to 150 μL of stock UCB/DMSO solution. To
          minimize UCB oxidation, all tubes and solutions were
          deoxygenated with Argon and kept in the dark [ 31 ] . To
          determine the [UCB] in the UCB/DMSO stock, 6.0 μL, was
          added to 3.0 mL of the HSA stock. The absorbance, 
          A  , at 460 nm was read against a
          blank containing 2.0 mL of HSA stock plus 4.0 μL DMSO,
          and the [UCB] calculated using the extinction
          coefficient, ε, 47,000 M -1.cm -1 [ 18 ] . The pH
          measurement of each final DMSO/aqueous buffer system
          included an electrode calibration using the strong acid,
          HClO 
          4  [ 8 ] . The 0.1 M phosphate buffer
          in N = 0.31 DMSO was centrifuged because of partial
          insolubility [ 8 ] and only the supernatant was used.
        
        
          Centrifugation and analysis of residual UCB in
          supernatants
          Fifteen min after mixing, samples were assessed
          visually for turbidity or precipitation. After
          Vortex-mixing, duplicate 1.8 mL aliquots were transferred
          to polypropylene tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 25°C
          and 14,000 
          g  (Mikroliter centrifuge, Hettich,
          Tuttlingen, Germany). The supernatants were assayed
          spectrophotometrically within 20 min. The precipitates
          were washed once with 1.8 mL of water, again centrifuged,
          the water aspirated, and the packed precipitate dissolved
          in DMSO for spectrophotometry. Absorbance ( 
          A  ) was measured in triplicate at
          458 nm on each sample, diluted, when necessary, with DMSO
          or DMSO/buffer mixture to 
          A  of 0.2 to 0.8; a comparable
          medium without UCB was used as a blank. In all systems,
          including the redissolved UCB sediments, we applied the
          extinction coefficient of 0.0634 μM -1cm -1at the peak
          wavelength of 458 nm for UCB in pure DMSO [ 18 ] .
          Preliminary calibration studies. of the effects of DMSO
          concentration and buffer composition on 
          A  had confirmed this value for pure
          UCB in pure DMSO and in DMSO/buffer systems containing 64
          vol% DMSO. In the systems containing 27 and 9 vol% DMSO,
          the spectrum developed a plateau between 458 and 450 nm,
          but 
          A  at 458 nm remained within ± 10%
          of the value expected from applying the extinction
          coefficient of 0.0634 μM -1cm -1to the measured quantity
          of UCB dissolved in each system. The variability is in
          part due to degradation, discussed above, and in part due
          to the low absorbances at [UCB] below the saturation
          limit in some buffer/DMSO systems. For these reasons, no
          corrections were made for these minor differences in 
          A  .
        
        
          Sedimentation of bilirubin-albumin complexes
          To determine if UCB bound to HSA would sediment, we
          prepared a system containing HSA, 300 μM, and UCB 170 μM,
          in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.01. Microcentrifugation
          for 5 min yielded a small amount of precipitated UCB.
          Three aliquots of the clear supernatant were diluted with
          1/8th volume of DMSO and a fourth aliquot diluted with
          1/8th volume of buffer. The diluted samples (in
          duplicate) were then microcentrifuged for another 10 min
          and 25 μL samples taken from the top, middle and bottom
          of the fluid column in each tube, using a Hamilton
          syringe. Protein concentrations were determined with the
          Bio-Rad bicinchonic acid method, which is unaffected by
          bilirubin. After dilution with 1.8 mL DMSO, triplicate 
          A  readings were taken at 458
          nm.
