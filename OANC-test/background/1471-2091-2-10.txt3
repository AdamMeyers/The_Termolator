        The CD98 (4F2, FRP-1) molecule, a cell surface
        disulfide-linked heterodimer, was originally described as a
        T cell activation antigen [ 1 ] , and later was shown to
        provide a co-stimulatory signal for CD3-mediated T-cell
        activation [ 2 ] , independent of CD28/CD80/CD86
        interaction [ 3 ] . In other studies, triggering of human
        monocyte CD98 could suppress T cell proliferation [ 4 ] ,
        or promote homotypic cell aggregation of monocytes [ 5 ] .
        Also, CD98 may be a target antigen for natural killer cells
        [ 6 ] , may mediate fusion of blood monocytes leading to
        osteoclast formation [ 7 8 ] , and may modulate
        hematopoietic cell survival and differentiation [ 9 ] .
        The CD98 molecule is also widely expressed on rapidly
        growing non-hematopoietic cells, where it may modulate
        oncogenic transformation [ 10 11 ] , metal ion transport [
        12 13 ] , cell fusion [ 14 15 ] , and amino acid transport
        [ 16 17 18 19 ] . CD98 is also expressed on normal
        proliferating tissue such as the basal layer of squamous
        epithelia [ 20 ] and on cells having secretion or transport
        functions [ 21 ] . Understanding of the role of CD98 in
        amino acid transport has been greatly enhanced with the
        recent cloning and characterization of multiple CD98 light
        chains. Distinct CD98 light chains appear to mediate
        distinct amino acid transport activities (for review see [
        22 23 ] ).
        Several lines of evidence now suggest that CD98 may
        modulate the functions of integrins. For example, CD98 and
        β1 integrins may act together during T-cell co-stimulation
        [ 24 ] . A genetic screen revealed that CD98 may indirectly
        influence integrin affinity for ligand [ 25 ] . Also,
        anti-CD98 mAb appeared to modulate integrin-dependent
        adhesion in two separate studies [ 25 26 ] . In addition,
        antibodies to both CD98 and α3β1 integrin promoted cell
        fusion [ 27 ] , and antibodies to β1 and β2 integrins
        blocked monocyte cell-cell fusion and aggregation functions
        induced by an anti-CD98 mAb [ 5 ] . Finally, like CD98, the
        α3β1 integrin has been implicated in amino acid transport [
        28 ] .
        The biochemical mechanism by which CD98 and integrins
        functionally interact remains unclear. The CD98 molecule
        associates specifically with immobilized β1 integrin
        cytoplasmic tail fusion proteins under very mild detergent
        conditions (0.05% Triton X-100) [ 29 ] , but CD98 has not
        yet been shown to interact physically with intact β1
        integrins. We began the present study by searching for
        integrin-associated proteins in an unbiased manner (i.e. we
        were not specifically looking for CD98). We utilized a
        monoclonal antibody screening method involving
        co-immunoprecipitation of integrins under non-stringent
        detergent conditions [ 30 31 ] . Using this approach, we
        have previously discovered specific associations between
        particular β1 integrins and other cell surface molecules
        including CD147/EMMPRIN [ 31 ] , and various tetraspanin
        (transmembrane-4 superfamily) proteins [ 30 32 33 ] . In
        this report we demonstrate for the first time that CD98
        constitutively and specifically associates with intact β1
        integrin heterodimers. Specific CD98-integrin interaction
        occurs in the context of low density protein-lipid
        microdomains, possibly resembling lipid rafts [ 34 35 ] .
        Several important signaling molecules, including activated
        TCR, LAT and LCK are present in organized raft-type
        microdomains, and integrity of these microdomains is
        necessary for T cell receptor signal transduction [ 36 37 ]
        . Our present discovery that β1 integrins specifically
        associate with CD98 in lipid microdomains helps to explain
        the functional connections between β1 integrins and CD98
        during T cell costimulation, monocyte fusion, and
        elsewhere.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Identification of CD98 as a β1 integrin-associated
          protein
          Mice were immunized with MTSV1-7 human mammary
          epithelial cells, and approximately 600 hybridomas were
          generated. Upon monoclonal antibody screening, 16 were
          identified that co-immunoprecipitated integrins without
          recognizing integrins directly. Of these, one recognized
          CD63 as reported previously [ 30 ] , and three (including
          mAb 6B12) recognized a disulfide-linked cell surface
          heterodimer consisting of an 85 kD heavy chain and a 35
          kD light chain.
          From I 125surface-labeled HT1080 cells, mAb 6B12
          immunoprecipitated a heterodimer of 85 and 35 kD under
          reducing conditions (Fig. 1, lane a, solid arrows) and a
          single protein band of 120 kD under non-reducing
          conditions (not shown) but no other protein bands when
          lysates were prepared in 1% Triton XI 00 detergent.
          However, in the less stringent Brij 58 detergent, mAb
          6B12 co-immunoprecipitated an integrin-like protein band
          of 130 kD (Fig. 1, lane b, dotted arrow). Similar results
          were noted when CHAPS or Brij 99 detergents were used
          (not shown).
          Because the proteins recognized by 6B12 resembled the
          disulfide-linked 85 and 35 kD subunits of CD98 [ 38 39 ]
          , they were compared to authentic CD98 as precipitated
          using mAb 4F2. Both mAb 4F2 and mAb 6B12 precipitated
          identical patterns of cell surface proteins, as seen by
          reduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, lanes c,d). Furthermore,
          preincubation of cell lysates with mAb 4F2 resulted in
          loss of the antigen recognized by mAb 6B12 (not shown).
          Upon addition of 10 mM DTT to cell lysates, mAb 6B12
          immunoprecipitated only a 85 kD protein band, consistent
          with specific recognition of the CD98 heavy chain. Flow
          cytometry of CHO cells transfected with CD98 heavy chain
          cDNA confirmed that the CD98 heavy chain is the 6B12
          antigen (Fig. 1B). Also, by flow cytometry the 6B12
          antigen was present at high levels on all human cell
          lines tested (more than 20) as expected for CD98.
        
        
          Specificity of CD98-integrin association
          To identify the integrin-like 130 kD protein(s)
          co-precipitating with CD98, immune complexes prepared
          from HT1080 cells were dissociated and reprecipitated
          with mAb against various cell surface molecules. From
          CD98 immunoprecipitates we recovered α3β1 integrin, but
          not other cell surface molecules, including the LDL
          receptor, HLA class I, the metalloprotease regulator
          EMMPRIN (CD 147), CD71, or CD 109 (Fig. 2A). Several
          other β1 integrins that are abundant on HT1080 cells
          (α3β1, α2β1, α5β1, and α6β1) also could be
          re-precipitated from CD98 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C).
          Using the same experimental conditions, we were unable to
          detect α4β1 in CD98 immunoprecitates prepared from the
          rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD, the lymphoblastoid cell
          line Molt4, or K562 cells transfected with α4 integrin
          (not shown). However, we did observe
          co-immunoprecipitation of CD98 with α4β1 integrin in the
          presence of 2 mM manganese (not shown). The precise role
          of manganese is unclear. Incubation with anti-β1
          'activating antibody' TS2/16 (not shown) did not mimic
          the effects of manganese on α4β1-CD98 association. Thus,
          although manganese is well known to "activate" β1
          integrins [ 60 ] , this activation may not be relevant to
          α4β1-CD98 association. Comparison of material isolated
          from CD98 immunoprecipitates with total amounts of each
          integrin on the cell surface indicates that approximately
          5-10% of each integrin is associated with CD98 (Fig. 2C,
          compare lanes a-d with e-h). In a reciprocal experiment,
          CD98 heavy chain was re-precipitated from an α3β1
          integrin immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2B, lane a) at a level
          comparable to re-precipitated CD81 (lane b), a molecule
          shown previously to associate with α3β1 integrins [ 32 ]
          . Results in Fig. 2Aand 2Bindicate that CD98-integrin
          complexes are distinct from previously described
          integrin-CD81 [ 32 40 ] and integrin-CD147/EMMPRIN [ 31 ]
          complexes.
          Because not all β1 integrins associated constitutively
          with CD98 (in the absence of manganese), the α chain must
          help regulate specificity of CD98 association. Notably,
          α3 with a truncated cytoplasmic tail, and wild-type α3
          associated equally well with CD98 (Fig. 2D, lanes c,d).
          Thus, specificity for constitutive association with CD98
          may reside in integrin α chain extracellular or
          transmembrane domains. To check whether CD98 is a ligand
          for α3β1 integrin, we used K562 cells transfected with
          wild type α3, or α3 mutants deficient in adhesion to α3
          ligands laminin 5 (W220A) and invasin (Y218A) [ 41 ] .
          All of these α3 proteins constructs associated with CD98
          (Fig. 2E). Notably, 2 mM EDTA had no inhibitory effect on
          constitutive integrin-CD98 associations (not shown).
          Thus, CD98 itself does not appear to be acting as an
          integrin ligand. We were unable to demonstrate any
          changes in the adhesive functions of CHO cells upon
          CD98-transfection. However, functional effects of
          transfected human CD98 could be overshadowed by an excess
          of endogenous hamster CD98.
          Next we asked whether clustering of CD98 would induce
          selective clustering of β1 integrins. On the surface of
          RD-A3 cells, CD98 was clustered by incubation with
          anti-CD98 mAb 4F2, followed by incubation with rabbit
          anti-mouse antibody. Subsequent incubation with anti-α3
          mAb directly conjugated to Alexa-488 revealed that α3β1
          was highly clustered (Fig. 3C), unless pre-clustering of
          CD98 was omitted (Fig. 3A). In contrast, staining with
          anti-α4-Alexa-488 mAb revealed a diffuse pattern of
          staining, regardless of CD98 clustering (Fig. 3B, 3D). If
          no Alexa-488-conjugated antibodies were added, no
          staining was observed (not shown). Immunofluorescent
          staining of both α3β1 and CD98 showed that they were
          distributed similarly on the cell surface of HT1080 and
          RD-A3 cells and partially co-localized (not shown).
        
        
          CD98 mutation and sucrose density gradient
          localization
          The CD98 heavy chain contains two extracellular
          cysteines. Each of these cysteines was mutated to serine,
          and the effects on β1 integrin association were
          evaluated. Stably expressed human CD98 heavy chain C330S
          mutant retained association with endogenous murine β1 in
          NIH 3T3 cells, comparable to that seen for wild type CD98
          heavy chain. However, the C109S mutant showed no
          detectable β1 association (Fig. 4A, right panel). Murine
          β1 (Fig. 4A, left panel), and mutant and wild type forms
          of CD98 (see legend) were expressed at comparable levels
          in each of the transfectants. Notably, association of
          CD98 heavy chain with CD98 light chain was maintained for
          the C330S mutant, but was lost for the C109S mutant (not
          shown), in agreement with previously published results
          suggesting that Cysteine 109 is required for disulfide
          linkage to the light chain [ 42 ] . These results suggest
          that the CD98 light chain might be necessary for
          CD98-integrin association. One possibility is that the
          light chain is more proximal to the integrin. When
          suitable anti-light chain reagents become available, this
          could be directly tested in covalent crosslinking
          experiments. In this regard, we have thus far been unable
          to crosslink CD98 heavy chain directly to β1 integrin,
          using either membrane-permeable or membrane-impermeable
          crosslinkers (not shown).
          Another possibility is that the CD98 light chain may
          target the CD98 heterodimer to the specific membrane
          domain where interactions with β1 integrins may be
          localized. To test the latter hypothesis, we compared the
          total β1 integrin distribution with the distribution of
          the fraction of β1 integrins complexed with CD98 on HT
          1080 cells (Fig. 4B). Although β1 integrins were
          predominantly present in the dense membrane fraction on a
          sucrose gradient, the subset of β1 integrins complexed
          with CD98 was localized to the 'light' membrane
          fractions. These fractions typically contain caveolae and
          'membrane rafts' thought to be enriched in active
          signaling complexes [ 34 35 43 ] . The fraction of the β1
          integrins detected in the light membrane fractions
          represents no more than 5% of total β1 integrins (based
          on the densitometric analysis, not shown). Though
          caveolin is present in the same fractions as
          CD98-integrin complexes, it does not co-immunoprecipitate
          with CD98 under these conditions (not shown) and thus is
          not part of integrin-CD98 complexes. Similarly,
          GPI-linked proteins such as CD 109, TM4SF proteins such
          as CD81, and other transmembrane proteins such as
          CD147/EMMPRIN can be found at substantial levels in light
          membrane fractions [ 44 45 ] , and our unpublished
          results), and these also did not co-immunoprecipitate
          with CD98 (Fig. 2A, 2B). Thus, CD98 association with
          integrin has another level of specificity beyond simply
          co-localizing in light membrane fractions.
          Finally, to see whether the CD98 light chain might
          help to target the CD98 heavy chain to the light membrane
          fractions, we looked at the distribution of the wild type
          CD98 and CD98 mutants in the sucrose gradients (Fig.
          4C,D). The majority of wild type CD98 heavy chain and
          control mutant (C330S) are localized to the light
          membrane fraction (55-60%, Fig. 4D), whereas the C109S
          mutant is partially shifted to the dense fractions (40%
          in the light fraction, 50% in the dense fractions, Fig.
          4D). These results are consistent with the CD98 light
          chain targeting the CD98 heavy chain to light membrane
          fractions. It is perhaps not surprising to observe ~40%
          of the C109S heavy chain mutant remaining in the light
          membrane fraction (Fig. 4C,D), considering that the CD98
          heterodimer retains partial association and amino acid
          transport function even in the absence of a disulfide
          linkage of the subunits [ 42 ] . Notably, transformation
          of BALB 3T3 cells caused by over-expression of CD98 heavy
          chain required its association with the light chain, and
          a missense mutation in C109 eliminated its transforming
          activity [ 10 ] .
          The CD98 protein was recently shown to associate
          specifically with integrin β chain cytoplasmic tail
          fusion proteins [ 29 ] in 0.05% Triton X-100 detergent
          conditions. One may speculate that the use of 0.05%
          Triton X-100 may have allowed maintenance of CD98
          microdomains, needed for β1 interaction. In this regard,
          in 0.05% Triton X-100 lysates, many transmembrane
          proteins remain in the light membrane fractions of a
          sucrose gradient [ 46 47 ] . Although the role of the
          CD98 light chain was not addressed in the earlier study [
          29 ] , we assume that it may have played a key role.
          Furthermore, CD98 interaction with recombinant β chain
          cytoplasmic tail fusion proteins, in the absence of the α
          chain [ 29 ] , is consistent with our observation that
          the α chain cytoplasmic tail is not needed for
          integrin-CD98 association. On the other hand, we observed
          CD98 interaction with several β1 integrins, but not α4β1.
          Thus for intact integrins in the context of mammalian
          cells, the integrin β chain apparently does contribute to
          the specificity of CD98 interaction. The α chain might
          provide a level of specificity by changing the
          conformation of the β chain and/or by providing an
          additional site of interaction with the CD98 light or
          heavy chains.
          Because our integrin-CD98 complex was observed in
          light membrane fractions and not in dense sucrose
          gradient fractions, and because we could not capture the
          complex by covalent crosslinking (not shown), the
          interaction may not be direct. Nonetheless, an abundance
          of evidence points to the functional relevance of this
          complex (references above). Furthermore, integrin
          αVβ3-CD47 complexes have considerable functional
          relevance, despite being found only under relatively mild
          detergent conditions (e.g. Brij 58) and exclusively in
          the light membrane fractions of a sucrose gradient [ 48
          49 ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, we show a highly specific biochemical link
        between intact β1 integrins and CD98, as demonstrated by
        reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and co-clustering
        experiments. Furthermore, CD98 association with β1
        integrins appears to occur in the context of an ordered
        lipid microdomain (as evidenced by co-localization in light
        membrane fractions of sucrose density gradients), and
        appears to require the light chain of CD98. These results
        may help to explain recent reports that CD98 may modulate
        integrin ligand binding, adhesion, signaling, T cell
        co-stimulation and cell fusion functions.

          C109Sas-5'-CGCCGGTAGCTCGCGAGAACGCGGCGCTCG-3'; C330Ss -
          5'-GGCAATCGCTGGTCCAGCTGGAGTTTGTCTCAGGC-3';C330Sas -
          5'-GCCTGAGACAAACTCCAGCTGGACCAGCGATTGCC-3'. CD98 heavy
          chain constructs were subcloned into pLXIZ retroviral
          vector (Clontech). Transient transfection of φ nx-Eco
          cells and retroviral infection of NIH 3T3 cells was
          performed as described [ 59 ] . Stable NIH 3T3 infectants
          were selected in growth medium containing 1 mg/ml
          zeocin.
        
        
          Immunoprecipitation experiments
          For immunoprecipitations, labeled cellular proteins
          were extracted with lysis buffer (1% of the indicated
          detergent, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM PMSF,
          10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5
          mM CaCl2) for 60 minutes at 4°C. After preincubation with
          protein A-sepharose 4CL, the cell extract was incubated
          with specific mAb directly conjugated to sepharose 4B for
          60 min, washed 3 times with the appropriate lysis buffer
          and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. In some
          experiments manganese chloride (2 mM) was added both to
          cells (10 minutes prior to lysis) and to the lysis
          buffer.
          For re-immunoprecipitation experiments, associated
          proteins were eluted from immune complexes in 1% Triton
          X100 in PBS, then pre-incubated with protein
          A-sepharose-4CL. Remaining proteins were then
          re-precipitated from the eluate using mAb directly
          conjugated to sepharose 4B beads for 30 min at 4°C,
          washed three times with 1% Triton X100 in PBS, eluted
          with Laemmli sample buffer, and resolved on SDS-PAGE.
        
        
          Detergent-free purification of light membrane
          fractions
          Isopycnic fractionation in sucrose gradients was
          performed essentially as described [ 43 ] . Briefly,
          cells (one confluent T162 flask of HT1080 or NIH 3T3
          cells expressing different CD98 constructs) were lysed in
          2 ml 500 mM sodium carbonate buffer, pH 11, in the
          presence of protease inhibitors and passed through 25
          gauge needle 5 times followed by 6 passages through 27
          gauge needle. The homogenate (1 ml) was adjusted to 45%
          sucrose by addition of 1 ml of 90% sucrose in MBS (25 mM
          MES, pH6.5, 150 mM NaCl) and placed at the bottom of an
          ultracentrifuge tube. A 5-35% discontinuous sucrose
          gradient was formed above (1 ml of 5% sucrose: 2 ml of
          35% sucrose, both in MBS containing 250 mM sodium
          carbonate) and centrifuged at 45 000 rpm for 16-18 hrs in
          SW 55 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). From
          the top of each gradient 0.4 ml fractions were collected
          and analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, or adjusted to
          pH 7.5 (with HCl) and used for immunoprecipitation
          experiments.
