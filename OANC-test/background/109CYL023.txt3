      Cecilia desperately searched for medical care for her unborn child.
      She would have a better chance of getting help and delivering a healthy
      baby if she lived in Sweden. But Cecilia lives in central Indiana.
      Cecilia might even be your neighbor.
      Dear:
      When I found out that the infant mortality rate in Indiana was 86
      percent greater than for mothers in Sweden, I was shocked.
      Later, my distress hit home in a personal way when I discovered than
      an expectant mother who lived just a few blocks from my house in Marion
      County - a young, unmarried woman just like Cecilia -- had difficulty
      obtaining prenatal care.
      Realizing the seriousness of the problem helped motivate me to join
      with individuals like you who have helped to prevent needless suffering
      in our community by contributing to United Way of Central Indiana.
      When a young, unmarried woman like Cecilia becomes pregnant, the risks
      to her unborn child are very serious. In Cecilia's case she had to face
      the situation with a limited education, no skills and no source of
      income. Would it surprise you to learn that less than two years away from
      the millennium, the problem of supplying prenatal care to young, single
      mothers is one of growing concern in our community?
      Of those beginning prenatal care in the first trimester, Indiana
      mothers rank in the lower third of individuals receiving such care
      nationwide. And that's just one significant example of community need.
      There are many other important areas where children, families, the
      elderly and disabled need our help.
      Having exhausted all of her options, Cecilia turned to her family
      priest where she found support and guidance. Cecilia was brought to a
      residential outreach maternity service funded by United Way of Central
      Indiana. When I investigated all the different ways I could get involved
      to help local families, I discovered the answer that made the most sense
      was United Way of Central Indiana.
      United Way, and ONLY United Way, regularly conducts research in our
      community to find out where the most important needs are. If United Way
      didn't do this it wouldn't be done at all. At St. Elizabeth's home,
      Cecilia received a place to live until her baby was born. She received
      prenatal care, child care training, friendship and peer group
      support.
      Your past contribution provided a direct line of support for local
      programs that promote health and wellness, strengthen families, invest in
      our children, help people become self-sufficient, and serve the elderly
      and disabled.
      Cecilia gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Whenever she looks at her
      son she feels grateful to United Way for the good start she was able to
      give him.
      And that's why I'm writing to you today. I urge you to continue to
      make a difference in the lives of individuals like Cecilia and her son.
      You can literally help save a life. 89 percent of the at-risk pregnant
      women served by St. Elizabeth Home have given birth to healthy
      babies.
      Following the birth of her child, Cecilia received job training at
      another United Way funded agency. This story ended happily... perhaps
      because of your past contribution. Remember, just $50 or $4.16 per month
      can provide a homeless. expectant mother with two visits to an
      obstetrician for Prenatal care.
      Thanks to the support United Way of Central Indiana receives from
      people like you, there are hundreds of stories like Cecilia's. But
      unfortunately there are also hundreds of examples where vital services
      were not available because of lack of funds.
      Please continue with your neighbors to see to it that no expectant
      mother goes without medical care... no child goes without nourishment ...
      no family goes without shelter.
      Will you help? Today?
      If you would consider increasing your past pledge by just $25 this
      year it would be wonderful. If you could possibly increase your pledge by
      even more, I would be overjoyed. But please join us again this year so
      that stories such as Cecilia's can continue.
      Sincerely,
      1998 United Way of Central Indiana Campaign Chair
      P.S. Today Cecilia is self-supporting. She lives with her 15-month old
      son in a clean, cheerful home. Without the support of United Way of
      Central Indiana, Cecilia's story might not have had such a happy ending.
      Please join with us to see that happy endings do continue.
