      Dear Name:
      Thank you for visiting the Ruth Lilly YMCA Outdoor Center. Camp is now
      in full swing and the kids are having a great time.
      We would like to give middle school youth who are part of our Urban
      Mission Branch a chance to participate in an outdoors experience. The
      opportunities presented by the Ruth Lilly Outdoor Center offer these kids
      learning experiences not available in the inner-city environment. Please
      consider a grant of $10,000 in support of fall and spring weekend
      adventures for 30 girls. The weekends will include team course,
      environmental education, and self-esteem building for youth ages 10
      through 14.
      A critical transition takes place between 3rd grade and the 8th grade
      - elementary school to middle school. A survey of over 36,000 Indiana
      youth conducted by the IU Prevention Resource Center found that
      approximately two-thirds of substance abuse begins with this age group.
      Therefore, this age group continues to need more adult supervision and
      positive programs during after school hours. Many skills and life
      patterns, which are key components for self-sufficiency, are formed
      during this period.
      The Urban Mission Branch was established to address this underserved
      age group. The Branch's goals focus on increasing the percentage of youth
      who: Grow into mentally and physically healthy adults; Know how to
      structure their lives in ways that produce meaning and enjoyment; Plan
      their high school program to allow them to qualify for future higher
      education, even if the current goals are vocational; Use non-violent
      conflict resolution skills when needed; Reach adulthood without being
      involved in alcohol, tobacco and other drug use; Are able to develop and
      achieve their goals and aspirations.
      The initial programs have been very successful and the YMCA has been
      invited into more communities within Center Township. One program, which
      has experienced immediate results, is the Sista Friends program. Designed
      to resemble a sorority, this project emphasizes active youth involvement
      in character education to reinforce the enduring values of caring,
      honesty, respect and responsibility. In this way the YMCA seeks to
      fulfill its mission: To put Christian principles into practice through
      programs that encourage personal growth and build health of spirit, mind
      and body for all.

      Educational outreach, tutoring services, family planning and mentoring
      are provided in an ongoing and systematic approach to these inner-city
      youth. Students who participate are selected with the help of school
      counselors and other community agencies that serve as the Y's partner. Y
      staff trained in conflict resolution and adolescent programs guide the
      youth through a process of skill and esteem building. Sista Friends is
      based on a similar model that has experienced great success in other
      urban areas. The young people targeted for this program are from School #
      61, Stonybrook Middle School and the Barrington and Bethel Teen
      Centers.
      The program will be evaluated using the YMCA of the USA's Youth
      Development Survey based on The Search Institute's Youth Asset Model. The
      survey will be conducted at the fall and again at the spring weekend.
      Anticipated outcomes from the spring survey include: 80% of youth will
      report increased supervised time in safe environments. 80% of
      participants will report increased conflict resolution skills. 80% of
      participants will have established short and long-term goals for self
      sufficiency in adulthood as measured by staff checklists. 70% of
      participants will report a minimum of 3 hours per week doing homework
      outside of school. 80% of participants will report doing community
      service work on survey. 65% of participants will indicate that being in
      YMCA programs has helped them stay out of trouble. 65% of participants
      will indicate that since they have been coming to the YMCA, caring about
      other people has become more important to them.
      In the next five years, there will be significant new initiatives to
      organize community resources and partnerships for youth development. The
      YMCA has the experience, resources and track record to be in the
      forefront. YMCA leadership can influence these constructive efforts in
      the community to expand youth development programs. The Hoover Family
      Foundation can help us begin with thirty, inner-city young women.
      Thank you for your continued support of community-based projects which
      have an impact.
      Sincerely,
      Roberta L. Donahue, Executive Director Foundation
