      Dear Friend,
      If The Salvation Army's Red Shield could talk, it might tell you how
      we recently helped a man with diabetes get the insulin he needed... a
      single mother purchase eyeglasses for her first-grade daughter... or an
      elderly widow find the strength to face life on her own...
      I enjoy sharing these small victories with you through my letters.
      After all, your generosity makes them possible.
      I know that from my desk at The Salvation Army, I have a unique
      perspective, and I want you to know without a doubt that we are meeting
      needs -- one person at a time, every day ... all year round. And the
      scope of The Salvation Army's services extends far beyond this community.
      It blankets the country. It covers the globe.
      That's why I believe it's important for you to hear what people
      outside of our ministry are saying about The Salvation Army. Over the
      years, a number of well-respected individuals have spoken out on behalf
      of our mission ... our service ... and our stewardship.
      By endorsing The Salvation Army as a whole, they're supporting our
      efforts here at home, as well. I've enclosed a few of the excerpts I keep
      close at hand. After you read them, I hope you'll feel even more
      confident about the role you play in helping us help others.
      I hope your organization, too, will continue its endorsement of The
      Salvation Army. Your gift today of $25, $50, $125, $250 or more will help
      keep our Red Shield a strong, reputable symbol of hope -- for those we
      assist, as well as for those who are watching!
      Blessings,
      Jack C. Getz Major DIVISIONAL COMMANDER
      P.S. Your gift to The Salvation Army will be used right here in
      Central Indiana.
