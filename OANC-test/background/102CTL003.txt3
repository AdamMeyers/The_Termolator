      Your gift can plant the seed of learning in an Indy Reads student like
      Joe Johnson. You can hear how proud Joe is of his garden when you read
      his essay, can't you? Imagine how proud he must be of his writing skills,
      and his reading skills! When he was assigned his first tutor, Joe was
      reading below the first grade level. Today, he and his new tutor are
      exploring the Internet and plotting routes to travel out west while they
      continue to strengthen his reading and writing.
      Joe's tremendous growth in these basic skills is the result of his own
      hard work, and the care and nurturing of his tutors. Your gifts have
      helped him grow, too, by providing the training and support Joe's tutors
      have needed, buying the books, Joe used, and giving him the opportunity
      to meet and learn with other adult learners from Indianapolis and around
      the country.
      We hope the enclosed bookmark, just the right size for a paperback,
      will remind you of Joe and the hundreds of other adults working to
      improve their lives, their families and their community through stronger
      basic skills. We also hope you'll take time out from your spring planting
      to make a gift in honor of Joe's garden. Your gift today will help
      students grow tomorrow.
      Sincerely,
      P.S. Many adults in our community don't enjoy reading the way you and
      I do. Won't you help plant the seed of learning in them through a gift to
      Indy Reads?
