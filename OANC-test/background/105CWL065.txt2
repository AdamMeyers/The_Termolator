      Dear Name:
      1996 is off to a fast start! And as March begins, we wanted to remind
      you to consider your contribution to the 1996 Annual Appeal. And as you
      do so, Girl Scouts from all over the Hoosier Capital Council invite you
      to test your knowledge of the crucial services funded through Annual
      Appeal dollars.
      "Which of the following services are important to quality Girl Scout
      programming in central Indiana and are funded through revenue generated
      by the Annual Appeal?"
      Library resources including audio/visual aids, flags on loan, and
      books, add to the Girl Scout experience so that girls and volunteers have
      the tools they need to make Girl Scouting a positive learning
      experience.
      Boats, canoes, tents, high adventure equipment, and even the simple
      convenience of stoves and refrigerators create a camping environment
      that's fun, challenging and safe.
      Adult education opportunities give volunteers skills that are helpful
      to their own self-development and in their relationships with girls.
      Liability and property insurance contributes to secure programs for
      girls and adults.
      Quality staff support means girls and adults have advice and
      professional assistance available to them when they need it.
      Communication tools like Safety-Wise, Happenings, along with event
      calendars and other materials, allow volunteers to provide quality,
      informed leadership.
      Four camp properties add to the enjoyment of girls and adults
      throughout the 7 1/2 county area served by Hoosier Capital.
      Staff and maintenance materials for upkeep, paint and repair of
      property help make it possible for everyone to enjoy a clean, safe and
      comfortable environment.
      Every service listed above is a reason for you to give to the 1996
      Annual Appeal. Your annual gift directly funds the council services that
      ensure girls and volunteers will continue to benefit from the quality
      programming of Hoosier capital.
      Please give what you can. it is imperative that we reach the Board of
      Directors' goal of 100% participation.
      On behalf of the girls we serve,
      Janet Baker
      P.S. As you know, this is an extraordinary year for council fund
      raising. Please keep in mind, requests for donations to the Capital
      Campaign are separate and will be made later this month.
