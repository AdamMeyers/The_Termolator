      Dear Friend:
      In November, we sent letters sharing with you a story about the Boys
      & Girls Club, a wonderful, positive place for children and youth in
      our community. We hope you had an opportunity to read about Robert and
      his time at the Club before the letter became lost in the numerous pieces
      of mail one receives over the holidays. The new year is here, and it
      offers us an occasion to share with you another way your gift can touch
      the life of a child.
      Children come to the Club each day after school; many ride the vans
      and run into the building with backpacks and books. One little girl runs
      in and gives a special hug to a member of our staff. This child, Becky,
      is six years old and lives with her father. She often has a drawing or
      craft project which she made in school. Becky gives the "artwork" to our
      staff member who hangs the budding artist's work on the office door. The
      staff member has mentioned several times to Becky that she should take
      the art home, but Becky doesn't want to; she wants the staff person to
      have it. Becky is a friendly, bright little girl who often gets confused
      and will refer to a female staff person as "mommy". The Club can never
      replace a parent, but the caring staff and volunteers can help fill the
      void in Becky's life during the few hours she is there each day.
      Touching the lives of youth on a daily basis, helping develop new
      skills, and preparing children to face the challenges of the next century
      are the Club's strengths. And we need Your help to meet the
      challenge!
      Please help more children in Hamilton County, like Becky, know about a
      safe positive place for them in their non-school hours. Won't you take a
      few minutes today and invest in a youth. A contribution of $395 provides
      full participation in the Club for a boy or girl for one year; however,
      your gift in any amount can make a difference in a child's life.
      Sincerely,
