      Please join me as a shareholder in the Girl Scouts of Hoosier Capital
      Council, Inc. You can be assured that a donation to the Girl Scouts is a
      sound investment opportunity. Contributions will be used to cover program
      and membership costs for girls in financial need; subsidize the cost of
      Girl Scout camp; and provide training and resources to leaders, parents
      and adult volunteers. Additionally, it will help provide the Girl Scout
      experience to girls "at risk" or girls in "hard to serve" areas like the
      Indiana Girls School and the Juvenile Justice Center.
      This year's Annual Appeal goal is $65,000. Please consider a corporate
      donation of $2 Million or more to support Girl Scout programs and
      activities throughout Central Indiana.
      The Annual Appeal is one of two Girl Scout initiatives you will hear
      about in 1996. In addition to this appeal for operating funds, you will
      be contacted to consider making a three year commitment to give to our $2
      million capital campaign. The campaign funds will help provide a resource
      library, training materials and equipment; development of progressive
      math and science programs; and the construction of new centers at three
      of our camp properties.
      Take the first step toward making a difference in the lives of our
      young women and become a shareholder in the Girl Scout vision. Your
      investment in the Annual Appeal is sure to yield high returns.
      Sincerely,
      Charlotte G Fisher Honorary Chair, 1996 Annual Appeal CEO/President of
      Paul Harris Stores, Inc.
