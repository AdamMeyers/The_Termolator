1) make_termolator_fact_txt_files.py
   -- minor adjustment to fix bug for xml/html files
2) fixed DICT_DIRECTORY in term_utilties.py
3) Add parameter for list of topics (10th parameter)
4) Added initialize_utilities() to deal with paramterized differences between topics:
   if 'legal' is a member of special_domains:
      (a) we include the dictionary of legal terms
      (b) we don't use square brackets for abbreviations
5) fixed some errors in detecting the abbreviate relation
6) created run_abbreviate.sh to run abbreviate separately from
   the rest of the program
