<div class="poem1a">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">Being</span> gifted with decent taste and a sensitive eye,</p>
<p class="i2">I have never been much beguiled</p>
<p>By advertisements, crude in colour, and ten feet high</p>
<p class="i2">(Which, in fact, I rather reviled);</p>
<p>And, as for gigantic signs swinging up in the sky&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">They drove me perfectly wild!</p>

<p class="i16"><b>II.</b></p>

<div class="poem1a">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Then the lurid posters on paling and chimney-stack</p>
<p class="i2">Were the terror of every town&mdash;</p>
<p>Till a League was started by Mr. <span class="sc">William Black</span></p>
<p class="i2">For the purpose of putting them down;</p>
<p>And the sympathetic invited its efforts to back</p>

<div class="poem1a">  <div class="stanza">
<p>So I cheerfully paid the fee, and my name was enrolled,</p>
<p class="i2">And a solemn oath I swore;</p>

<p class="i2">That, in future, no shop or store</p>

<p>On the number of useful things that I'm dying to get&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">And my conscience tells me I mayn't!</p>
<p>As their various virtues are vaunted in letters of jet,</p>

<p>I should like to be clean if I could&mdash;but I cannot cope,</p>
<p class="i2">Without saponaceous aid,</p>
<p>With a shower of London smuts&mdash;and I'm losing hope,</p>
<p class="i2">Getting daily a dingier shade,</p>
<p>In a futile search for a genuine Toilet-soap</p>
<p class="i2">That has shunned meretricious parade!</p>

<p>My villa would be&mdash;when it's furnished&mdash;the cosiest nest,</p>

<p class="i2">And so shamelessly each will declare</p>
<p>His "Elegant Dining and Drawing-room suites" are the "cheapest and best"&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">That I daren't choose so much as a <i>chair</i>!</p>

<p>And even my path to a tranquil tomb is barred</p>

Rather! What a pleasant Cabinet Council. Why isn't the convivial

<h3>THE FUTURE HOPED BY HAWKINS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>A Cockney Carol by a cruelly-used Coster-Investor. With apologies to
clever Albert Chevalier.</i>)</p>

<blockquote><p>
["I desire to express, and I cannot do it too strongly, that there is no
credit to be attached to the conduct of the directors in this particular case.
It would be more satisfactory to me if directors had a proper sense of their
responsibility. It is a cruel thing that people should be deluded out of their
savings by high-sounding names. At the same time, there is no criminal law
which will punish a director who scandalously neglects his duty, though he
takes his money. I think the law might well be altered."&mdash;<i>Mr. Justice
Hawkins.</i>]

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<h4>"At the Sign of the 'Budget Shop."</h4></div>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April 24.</i>&mdash;House nearly Counted
Out just now, although it's Budget Night and usual Resolutions not
yet passed. Catastrophe averted, and sitting continued. <span class="sc">Childers</span>
come back to old scene. Looking on from below Gallery, says it's
the quietest Budget Night he remembers. Usually scene one of
seething excitement. One or more Trades expect taxes affecting
them will either go up or go down. Lobby besieged by anxious representatives.
Nothing of the sort to-night. When <span class="sc">Squire</span> of
<span class="sc">Malwood</span> rose to expound his mystery, Benches not fuller than on
ordinary night. Of those present there was no speculation in the
eyes they turned upon the <span class="sc">Chancellor</span> standing at table. The
<span class="sc">Squire</span>, a great Parliamentary
artist, attuned voice and
manner to prevailing tone;
avoided anything approaching
oratorical style; plain business
statement to make; accomplished
it in fine head-clerkly
manner.</p>

<p>An unfailing tradition
about Budget Speech is that
it shall contain at least one
quotation from the Classics.
Mr. G. from year to year observed
this custom with
splendid effect. <span class="sc">Lowe's</span> <i>Ex
luce lucellum</i> is famous in history;
nearly became the epitaph
of a Ministry; certainly
was the funeral wail over a
carefully-constructed Budget.
The <span class="sc">Squire</span> to-night
felt bound to observe tradition;
but in accordance with
his nature did it modestly,
adventuring nothing more
recondite than citation of the
familiar line that serves to
mark <span class="sc">Wren's</span> resting-place
in Westminster Abbey.
<span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> took opportunity
of remarking that he
was "disappointed with the
Budget." This mental attitude,
though not quite unexpected,
threw fresh gloom
over proceedings, and talk,
reduced to whisper, finally
died out.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget
brought in.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;The young men
behind <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> out
on the war-path. "Tell you
what," says <span class="sc">Legh</span> of Lyme;
"let's have <span class="sc">Bryce</span>'s scalp."</p>

<p>"By the Holy Roman Empire,
yes!" cried <span class="sc">George
Curzon</span>, to whom genial observation
was addressed. "Let's
get at him about his snubbing
<span class="sc">Sefton</span>, in matter of appointment
of Lancashire County
Magistrates. 'Twill serve a
double debt to pay. We'll have
a lark&mdash;'<i>Quelles alouettes!</i>' as it is written in the French translation
of <i>Great Expectations</i>, in the passage reporting conversation
between <i>Pip</i> and <i>Joe Gargery</i>. Moreover than which, we'll put a
spoke in business arrangements of Mr. <span class="sc">G.</span>, and stave off Home Rule
by so long."</p>

<p>"Be careful," said <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>; "ticklish subject, you
know. They're sure to have <span class="sc">Halsbury</span> up, and there unquestionably
was a degree of monotony about his appointments to
Commission of Peace."</p>

<p>"Oh bother <span class="sc">Halsbury</span>," said <span class="sc">Curzon</span>, to whom nothing is sacred.
"He's used to it by this time. You know what happened to the
viper who bit the Cappadocian's hide? <span class="sc">Halsbury</span>'s all right."</p>

<p>"Boys will be boys," said <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, looking at them
regretfully, and thinking of his own forty-five years. "But
perhaps it will be just as well if I clear out;" which he did, and so
missed a lively debate.</p>

<p>That Elderly Young Man, <span class="sc">Hanbury</span>, not in best form for such
operations. Lacks lightness of touch. <span class="sc">Henry James</span> also better
out of it. Gave performance serious turn, when he declared that in
borough of Bury <span class="sc">Bryce</span>, as soon as he came into office, appointed
eight Magistrates, all Liberals. That sounded very bad; Mr. G.
looked serious; some disposition shown on Treasury Bench to draw
apart from <span class="sc">Bryce</span>. All very well to talk about <span class="sc">Halsbury's</span>
goings
on; but if this sort of thing done by Liberal purists, things seem
rotten all round. When <span class="sc">Bryce</span> came to reply, he quietly added to
<span class="sc">James's</span> statement of case that, when he went to the Duchy, he
found of eighteen Magistrates sixteen were Unionists, only two
Liberals. He had, it is true, appointed six Liberals and two working-men,
whose politics he did not know. Bury Bench, accordingly,
now consisted of sixteen Unionists, eight Liberals, and two working-men.
Members wondered if <span class="sc">James</span> knew that when he made his
statement? Hoped he didn't. All very well with wig and gown on,
and brief in hand; but House
doesn't like this kind of
thing in debate.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Curzon's</span> statement about
sad condition of Magisterial
Bench at Southport, owing
to machinations of an iniquitous
Chancellor of the
Duchy, turned out to be not
more completely based on
fact than was <span class="sc">James's</span>. But
difference of manner in dealing
with case, everything.
No one took <span class="sc">Curzon</span> seriously,
and so no harm done.
His explanation of preponderance
of Conservative Magistrates
on Lancashire Bench
delightful. As good as some
touches of <span class="sc">Dizzy</span>, of whose
younger, lighter manner, he
much reminded old-stagers.
It was true, he admitted
that, on Lancashire Bench,
preponderance of Magistrates
was with Conservatives.
(Chancellor of Duchy gave
figures as he found them
arranged when he came into
office. On the Borough
Benches, 507 Unionists,
against 159 Liberals; on the
County Bench, 522 Unionists,
against 142 Liberals, a proportion
of nearly four to one.)
But how had it been brought
about? asked the Strayed
Reveller from the Corea.
"Why, it is because the
disturbing, mischievous policy
of the Right Hon. Gentleman
opposite" (this with
indignant sweep of the arm
towards Mr. G., feigning
sleep on the Treasury Bench)
"has driven into the opposite
ranks most of the intelligent,
respectable men,
from whom Justices are
chosen."</p>

<p>On <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Divison'">Division</ins>, Vote of Censure
on <span class="sc">Bryce</span> negatived by
260 votes; against 186. "I'm
not sure," said <span class="sc">Jokim</span>, whose
views of humour are limited, "that, what I may call the gain of
three hours lost, is worth the price paid; to wit, the opportunity
given to <span class="sc">Bryce</span> of disclosing the actual state of things in Lancashire
in the matter of Magisterial Bench, and the consequent doubling
of the Ministerial Majority."</p>

<p>"Well, as I remarked before," said Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, who had
come back for the Division, "Boys will be boys."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Employers' Liability Bill, with aid of Closure,
read Second Time.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Pretty to watch Mr. G. struggling with feeling of
expediency against temptation to make a speech. House in Committee
on Budget Bill; <span class="sc">Jokim</span> been discoursing at large on its proposals.
Quite lively. <span class="sc">Squire</span> of <span class="sc">Malwood</span> looked on, listening with
generous
approval, albeit he was target for <span class="sc">Jokim's</span> jocularity. This
time last year positions reversed. It was he criticising <span class="sc">Jokim's</span>
Budget. Now it was <span class="sc">Jokim's</span> turn, and the <span class="sc">Squire</span> magnanimously
stood the racket. Mr. G. sat by his side, an attentive listener,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span>
evidently strongly drawn to join in the fray.
But it was plainly the <span class="sc">Squire's</span> show, and its
direction must be left to him. When there
followed long succession of eminent men
discussing Budget, Mr. G. felt that if he
remained any longer he must yield to temptation.
Accordingly, withdrew from scene.
Returned again an hour later; still harping
on the Budget; the <span class="sc">Squire</span> had spoken twice,
and there seemed nothing to be done but to
work off whatever remaining speeches had
been prepared in Opposition camp.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dorington</span> dragged in case of farmer, and
small landowner; conversation turned on
Depression of Agriculture; the <span class="sc">Woolwich
Infant</span> presented himself to view of sympathetic
House as specimen of what a man of
ordinarily healthy habits might be brought
to by necessity of paying Income-tax on the
gross rental of house property. A procession
of friends of the Agriculturist was closed by
portly figure of <span class="sc">Chaplin</span>, another effective
object-lesson suitable for illustration of lectures
on Agricultural Depression. Mr. G.,
feeling there was no necessity for speech,
had resolutely withstood the others. <span class="sc">Chaplin</span>
at the table, proved irresistible. To him,
<span class="sc">Chaplin</span> is embodiment of the heresy of Protection,
Bi-metallism, and other emanations
of the Evil One. When <span class="sc">Chaplin</span> sat down,
<span class="sc">Premier</span> romped in, and, having delivered
the inevitable speech, went off home, soothed,
and satisfied.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget Scheme passed
through Committee.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Almost forgot we still have House
of Lords. Shall be reminded of their existence
by-and-by. For the nonce, they are
courteously quiescent, the world forgetting,
by the world forgot. Just a little flare-up
to-night. Ireland, of course; <span class="sc">Camperdown</span>
wanting to know what about the Evicted
Tenants Commission? Are the Government
going to legislate upon it, or will they
forbear? <span class="sc">Selborne</span> supernaturally solemn;
dragged in <span class="sc">James the Second</span> as the nearest
approach to any head of a Government quite
so wicked as Mr. G. Lords much interested
in this. Don't hear so much now of <span class="sc">James
the Second</span> as we did when at school. The
establishment of points of resemblance between
Governments of his day and that
presided over by Mr. G., a novelty in debate.
Imparted to political controversy a freshness
long lacking.</p>

<p>Just after seven, debate adjourned. For
all practical purposes, it might as well have
been concluded. But House doesn't get many
opportunities of debate; not disposed riotously
to squander this chance one.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Commons had Morning
Sitting; scrupulously devoted the last five
minutes of it to public business.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">Operatic Note</span>,&mdash;There's not much magic
about <i>The Magic Ring</i> at the Prince of
Wales's until the Second Act, in which the
extravagantly comic "business" of Messrs.
<span class="sc">Monkhouse</span> and <span class="sc">Kaye</span>, the burlesque acting
of Miss <span class="sc">Susie Vaughan</span>, and the comic trio
dance between the two low comedians and
the sprightly soprano, Miss <span class="sc">Marie Halton</span>,
are worth the whole of Act I. When
is burlesque not burlesque? When it is
Comic Opera. Burlesque was reported dead.
Not a bit of it, only smothered; and it may
come up fresh for a long run, or at all events,
"fit" for a good spurt.</p>

<hr />

<p>Even the old-fashionedest Toriest of Tory
Farmers are longing, hoping, and even praying,
for the downfall of the Rain. If we don't
have it soon, and it may have arrived ere this
appears, Marrowfats, as <i>articles de luxe</i>, will
be "Peas at any price!"</p>

<h3>A WORK OF&mdash;SOME IMPORTANCE.</h3>

<p>"Let who will give me a plot, <i>I</i> will write their dialogue."
(<i>Extract from Uncommon-place Book of</i> Mr. <span class="sc">O. Wilde</span>.) Now
when the author of <i>A Woman of No Importance</i> and of <i>Lady
Windermere's Fan</i> has to find his own materials for a plot
(<i>"'Play-wrights'
materials for plots made up.' Idea for Literary and
Dramatic Advertisement" Note-book, O. W.</i>)&mdash;well, he does find
them, and makes them his own. (<i>"Adoption not adaptation. A
clear distinction.&mdash;N.B. I confer the 'distinction'" O. W.</i>) Certainly
"Our <span class="sc">Oscar</span>" possesses the happy knack of turning out some
well-polished epigrams up to Drawing-room date. And so it happens
that, during the first two Acts, when Mr. <span class="sc">Wilde's</span> <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i>
are all gathered together, with nothing to do and plenty to
say, their conversation is light and airy, with an occasional sparkler
coming out (<i>"A summer night, with, at intervals, a brilliant meteor
flashing through the sky." Uncom. P. B., O. W.</i>), that crackles, goes
pop like the weasel of the old song, and "then is heard no more,"
as was the case with <i>Macbeth's</i> poor player, and, as he was a poor
player, his fate was not undeserved.&mdash;(<i>Mem. "A Lady Nickleby
or Duchesse de Malapropos, to misquote.&mdash;For example, she might
say, as quoting Shakspeare, 'Life's but a walking candle.'" O. W.</i>)</p>

<p>We all remember how poor <i>Mr. Dick</i> couldn't keep King Charles's
Head out of his manuscript. The Author of <i>No Importance</i> is similarly
affected. Left to himself for a plot, he cannot keep melodrama
out of his play, and what ought to have been a comedy pure and
simple (or the reverse) drops suddenly into old-fashioned theatrical
melodrama. During the first two Acts <i>Lady Hunstanton</i>, <i>Lady
Caroline Pontefract</i>, <i>Mrs. Allonby</i>, <i>Lord Illingworth</i>, <i>The
Venerable
James Daubeny, D.D.</i>, talk on pleasantly enough until interrupted
by the sudden apparition of the aforesaid King Charles the First's
Head, represented by the wearisome tirades, tawdry, cheap, and
conventional, belonging to the Lytton-Bulwerian-Money period of
the Drama, of which a considerable proportion falls to the share of the
blameless Miss <span class="sc">Julia Neilson</span>, who, as <i>la belle Am&eacute;ricaine</i>,
<span class="sc">Hester
Worsley</span>, in her attitude towards her audience, resembles the blessed
<i>Glendoveer</i>, inasmuch as it is "<i>hers</i> to talk, and <i>ours</i> to
hear."
Deeply, too, does everyone sympathise with lively Mrs. <span class="sc">Bernard
Beere</span>, who, as <i>Mrs. Arbuthnot</i>, a sort of up-to-date <i>Mrs.
Haller</i>,
is condemned to do penance in a kind of magpie costume of black
velvet, relieved by a dash of white, rather calling to mind the lady
whom <span class="sc">Charles Dickens</span> described as "<i>Hamlet's</i> Aunt," her funereal
attire being relieved by a whitened face with tear-reddened eyes. It
is these two characters, with <i>Gerald Arbuthnot</i>, Mr. <span class="sc">Fred Terry</span>,
who, like the three gruesome personages in <i>Don Giovanni</i>, will intrude
themselves into what might have been a pleasant, interesting comedy
of modern manners, if only it had had a good comedy plot.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, the acting is admirable. Mr. <span class="sc">Tree</span>, as the
titled cad, <i>Lord Illingworth</i>, is perfect in make-up and manner.
Certainly one of the many best things he has done. It is a companion
portrait to the other wicked nobleman in <i>The Dancing Girl</i>.
(<i>"There is another and a worse wicked nobleman" N. B., O. W.</i>)
But this is no fault, and, indeed, it would be difficult, if not impossible,
to find fault with Mr. <span class="sc">Tree's</span> <i>Lord Illingworth</i>. Mrs.
<span class="sc">Tree</span> as <i>Mrs.
Allonby</i>, is a very charming battledore in the game of
repartee-shuttlecock,
who with eight other principal characters in the piece,
has nothing whatever to do with the plot. To the character of <i>Lady
Hunstanton</i>, as written in the Mrs. Nickleby vein, and as played by
Miss <span class="sc">Rose Leclercq</span>, the success is mainly due; and "for this relief
much thanks." It is here and in the comedy characters of the
<i>Archdeacon</i> (Mr. <span class="sc">Kemble</span> excellent in this) and of <i>Lady
Caroline
Pontefract</i> (who couldn't have a better representation than Miss
<span class="sc">Le Thi&egrave;re</span>) that Mr. <span class="sc">O. Wilde</span> shows what he can do as a writer
of comedy, both in the quality of the material and its introduction
at the right moment. (<i>"The right speech at the wrong moment, or
the wrong speech at the right moment, both are fatal. Thus is it
that comedies become tragedies, and tragedies comedies." U.P.N.B.,
O. W.</i>) At the Haymarket the "play's" not "the thing," it is the
playing. (<i>"Likewise the writing," O. W.</i>)</p>

<p>However, it is not for the plot, or for the Bulwery-Lyttony orations,
or for the familiar melodramatic situations that audiences
will seek the Haymarket. No, it will be to hear the Christy-Minstrel
epigrammatic dialogue in the first two Acts, to laugh heartily at
Miss <span class="sc">Leclercq</span> as <i>Lady Nickleby Hunstanton</i>, to smile on the
<i>Archdeacon</i>
and <i>Lady Caroline</i>, and to enjoy the first-rate acting all round.</p>

<h4>MEMS, FROM THE O. W. UNCOMMONPLACE BOOK.</h4>

<p>"Essentials for success of modern play are 'Latitude and
Platitude.' First being risky is saved by second."</p>

<p><i>Receipt for Play-making.</i>&mdash;First catch your epigrams: preserve
them for use: serve with <i>sauce piquante un pen risqu&eacute;e</i> distributed
impartially among a variety of non-essential <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>,
invented for the purpose. Provide fine old crusted copybook moral
sentiments, to suit <i>bourgeois</i> palate: throw in the safe situation of
some one concealed, behind door or window, listening to private conversation.
Add one well-tried effective dramatic situation to bring
down curtain on penultimate Act, and there's a stage-dish to set
before the appreciative B. P., if only it can be presented to them
effectively garnished by a clever and popular Manager at a first-class
theatre.</p>

<h4>FLOWERS OF FASHION.</h4>

<p>The Botanical Afternoon F&ecirc;te of last Wednesday was a brilliant
gathering in brilliant weather. Privileged is "the Inner Circle"
to have in its midst these lovely gardens. "The Flowers that bloom
in the Spring, tra la!" were all out uncommonly early&mdash;long before
the earliest worm, which hasn't a chance against these very early
risers. "All a-growing!" on the part of the flowers, and "all
a-blowing" on the part of the Band of the Second Life Guards.
Among the distinguished company present we noticed the Crimson
Queen, looking immensely well, the blushing Duchess of <span class="sc">Albany</span>, the
Duchesse de <span class="sc">Vallombrosa</span>, Admiral <span class="sc">Courbet</span>, in a striking
costume
of "deep yellow splashed with red" (where <i>had</i> he been?), the
Ladies <span class="sc">Daphne Pink</span> and <span class="sc">Callas White</span>, and Mar&eacute;chal
<span class="sc">Niel</span>.
For "<i>Uriah Heep</i>," who "loves to be 'umble," a Silver Medal was
awarded to Mr. <span class="sc">Pike</span>. "The prize, that's my point," observed the
sharp <span class="sc">Pike</span>. Funny Fish <span class="sc">Pike</span>.</p>

purposes) he believes it to be.</p></blockquote>

<p>No. 18. <i>John Hare, Esq.</i>,
as seen and painted by Sir
<span class="sc">John E. Millais</span>, Bart., R.A.,
"<i>The Hare Apparent</i>"&mdash;to
every spectator. But what
an unpleasant position! The
eminent Actor is either studying
a part, or has the Box-office
account-book in his
hand, and wants a quiet moment
for serious thought or
close calculation; and yet, in
the next room to him (No. 19),
one of Mr. <span class="sc">Orchardson's</span>
young ladies is singing and
playing a yellow chrome-atic
scale, and in the room overhead
(No. 17), Mr. <span class="sc">Nettleship's</span>
tiger has broken loose, and is
taking a bath. When rescued
from these surroundings, this will remain at home a Hare-loominous
picture for the family.</p>

<p>No. 28. "<i>Toe-Toe chez Ta-Ta</i>." Miss <span class="sc">Toetoe</span>, in blue, at work
and looking down, says to the other girl, <span class="sc">Tata</span>, who is maliciously
smiling at her, "Oh dear! I <i>do</i> hope that no one will look at my
right thumb or my toes! O Mr. <span class="sc">Woods</span>, A., why was my right
thumb left like this?"</p>

<p>No. 34. In this Mr. <span class="sc">Morley Fletcher</span> shows us a Female Martyr
in Tomartyr-coloured dress, preparatory to being taken off to the
<i>Auto da f&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>No. 45. "<i>An Undress Rehearsal</i>" <span class="sc">Stuart G. Davis</span>.</p>

<p>No. 49. "<i>On the Temple Steps.</i>" By <span class="sc">John Griffiths</span>. For
years we've known that <span class="sc">Griffiths</span> is "the safe man" to follow.
But, unless this is a work of pure imagination, anyone well acquainted
with the Temple Pier and the Temple Steps will naturally
ask, "Where are the Steam-boats?"</p>

<p>Nos. 51, 52, and 53. The first is a Harmony in Sea by Mr. <span class="sc">Henry
Moore</span>, A., and the second is Mr. <span class="sc">Miller's</span>&mdash;(<span class="sc">William</span> not
<span class="sc">Joseph
Miller</span>)&mdash;<i>Colonel Hornsby-Drake</i>. This Drake seems out of his
element, as he ought to have been floating about with the wild fowl

<p>No. 70. <i>Study in P&acirc;tisserie.</i> Design for a chocolate ornament
covered with sugar. Recommended by Messrs. <span class="sc">Clark and
Hamilton</span>.</p>

<p>No. 71. <i>Lion in Desert.</i> Very tame. Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert Dicksee</span>.</p>

<p>No. 76. <i>The New Skirt Dance.</i> &there4; We strongly recommend
the study of this picture to admirers of the "Skirt Dance." It
shows how one of the male sex may attempt it&mdash;that is, according to
the idea of the designer, <span class="sc">Herbert Dicksee</span>.</p>

<p>No. 88. <i>Colonel W. Barnardiston.</i>
"First Chairman of
West Suffolk County Council."
Painted by <span class="sc">Hubert Herkomer</span>,
R.A. If he is "First
Chairman," it doesn't matter
what he is afterwards, since
he has been immortalised by
the admirable painting of
<span class="sc">Hubert Herkomer</span>. He'll
remain "First Chairman" in
the <i>Dramatis Person&aelig;</i> of this
year's Catalogue, at all events,
and be H. H.'s "Perpetual
First Chairman," too, be the
other where he may.</p>

<p>No. 103. "<i>Elder Bush</i>."
By <span class="sc">H. W. B. Davis,</span> R.A.
From the title you might
expect it to be the portrait of
a Presbyterian "Elder" named "<span class="sc">Bush</span>." But it isn't. Look at
it. It is the sweetest, most natural, perfectest of charming "bits"
of rural Nature in the whole show. There's no beating about this
bush; in fact this Elder Bush is one that is very hard to beat.</p>

<p>No. 130. <i>His Grace the Duke of Devonshire.</i> Encore! Bravo,
Mr. <span class="sc">Hubert Herkomer</span>. You're are a-going it this year, you are,
Sir! You've given the Duke all his Grace, and there's a kind of
orange tint about him, which, just now, is not without its political
signification.</p>

<p>No. 132. We must go to Kennington (<span class="sc">T. B. Kennington</span>) to see
"<i>The Queen of Love</i>." She is sitting on a tiger's skin, and has her
hand on the head of the savage beast, which shows its fangs. "A
<i>fang-see</i> subject," says <span class="sc">'Arry Joker</span>.</p>

<p>No. 158. <span class="sc">Honeymooners</span>. "Here we are again!" Same kind of
Stone Fruit from <span class="sc">Marcus Stone</span>, R.A. "Sparkles this Stone as it
was wont!"&mdash;<i>Cymbeline.</i> ii., 4. [<i>To be continued in our next.</i></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">Among the Immortals at the Royal Academy Banquet Last
Saturday</span>.&mdash;H.R.H. made one of his usually happy speeches; the
Duke of <span class="sc">Cambridge</span>, the Earl of <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>, and Lord
<span class="sc">Herschell</span>
represented the comedy element; while Lord <span class="sc">Kelvin</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Leslie
Stephen</span> were perfect in what, theatrically speaking, is termed "the
heavy lead;" and certainly their speeches were&mdash;ahem!&mdash;weighty.
Pretty to note how His Scarlet-robed Eminence entered the room,
not only with a grace all his own, but with His Grace of <span class="sc">Canterbury</span>
as well. Never was the President, Sir <span class="sc">Frederick Leighton</span>, more
effective in all his speeches, and especially when replying to the toast
of "The Academy," where the perfection of his speech lay in the
subtle concealment of its art, and in the genuine earnestness of his
advice to students <i>urbi et orbi</i>.</p>

<h3>ALL-A-BLOWING!</h3>

<h4>(<i>A Cockney Pastoral in Spring time.</i>)</h4>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><i>Who-o-o-f!</i> It's hot amost as Summer-time; yet what a blessed breeze</p>
<p>Is a-whiffing round the corners, and a-whoostling through the trees!</p>
<p>And the sunlight on the roof-slates, all aslant to the blue sky,</p>
<p>Seems to twinkle like the larfter in a pooty gurl's blue eye,</p>
<p>When you swing in the dance, and she feels you've got 'er step:</p>
<p>And the trees&mdash;ah! bless their branches!&mdash;through the winter weeks they've slep',</p>
<p>When the worrying winds would let 'em, all as black and mum as mutes,</p>
<p>A-waiting for the blackbirds, with their calls like meller flutes.</p>
<p>Just to whistle them awake like. Oh! but now they stir and rouse</p>
<p>Like a girl who has bin dreamin' of her lover in a drowse,</p>
<p>And wakes up to feel 'is kisses on 'er softly poutin' lips.</p>
<p>How they burst, all a-thirst for the April shower that drips</p>
<p>Tinkle-tink from leaf to leaf, washing every spraylet clean</p>
<p>From the sooty veil of London, which might dim the buddin' green</p>
<p>Of the pluckiest lime-tree, sproutin' o'er brown pales in a back-yard;</p>
<p>For these limes bud betimes, and they find it middlin' hard</p>
<p>To make way at windy corners, when the lamp as lights 'em through,</p>
<p>Like gold on green in pantomimes, is blown till it burns blue,</p>
<p>By the angry nor'east gusts. But the nor'east wind to-day</p>
<p>Is less like a rampin' lion than some new-born lamb at play.</p>
<p>Wy, the laylock's out aready, purple spires and creamy clumps.</p>
<p>Oh, that scent of shower-washed laylock! There's a somethin' in me jumps</p>
<p>As I ketch it round some corner, where the heart-shaped leaflets small</p>
<p>Cluster up against the stucco, as they did about that wall,</p>
<p>Grey, and gritty, and glass-spiked, of our tumble-down old cot</p>
<p>Out Epping way, in boy-time long ago, and quite a lot</p>
<p>Of remembrances came crowding, like good ghostes, in that scent;</p>
<p>There's the mother's call to dinner, there's the landlord's call&mdash;for rent!</p>
<p>And the call of the rooks,&mdash;and another call, fur off,</p>
<p>Like a whisper from a grave-yard, green and silent.</p>
<p class="i38">                                       Some may scoff</p>
<p>At a Cockney's chat of laylocks. I could bury my old phiz</p>
<p>In their crisp and nutty coolness, as I did when flirty Liz,</p>
<p>My first sweetheart, sent me packing, one Spring mornin'&mdash;for a while&mdash;</p>
<p>And them blossoms cooled my anger&mdash;most as much as the arch smile</p>
<p>Which won me back to wooin'.</p>
<p class="i28">                     There's a blackbird on the top</p>
<p>Of yon tall, half bare acacia, pipes as if he'd never stop,</p>
<p>Tryin' all his tunelets over, like a sort of talking flute:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Chip-chip! Tsee-tsee! Chu-chu! Chu-rook!</i>" goes the bird of sable suit.</p>
<p>"<i>We-know-it! We-know-it! We-know-it! Bring-the-whip!&mdash;the whip!&mdash;the whip!</i></p>
<p><i>"Chu-rook-chu-chu! Chu-rook-chu-chu! Tsee-tsee-chu-chu-chip-chip!</i>"</p>
<p>So he pours his pantin' heart out in a song half tune, half patter,</p>
<p>Like a meller music-haller of the tree-tops!</p>
<p class="i36">                                     Ah&mdash;what matter</p>
<p>That 'tis only London's outskirts, that I'm a poor Cockney cove,</p>
<p>When this Wondrous Spring is on us? As my shallow on I shove,</p>
<p>And blare out my "All-a-blowing, All-a-growing!" down the streets,</p>
<p>There's a something fresh and shining-like in every face I meets!</p>
<p>Tis the Spring-love breaking through them! Wy, the very dirt looks clean</p>
<p>In the shimmer of the sunlight, and the shadow of the green.</p>
<p><i>All-a-blowing! All-a-growing!</i> When I shout, I seem to sing,</p>
<p>For my cry takes on a music. It's the very Voice of Spring!</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
