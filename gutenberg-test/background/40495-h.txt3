The ORDEAL
OF
ELIZABETH
1


Chapter I

The Van Vorst Homestead stands close to
the road-side; a dark, low-built, gloomy old
place. The horse-shoe on the door, testifies
to its age, and the devout superstition of the Van
Vorst who built it. However effectual against
witches, the horse-shoe cannot be said to have
brought much luck otherwise. The Van Vorsts
who lived there, a junior branch of the old colonial
house, did not prosper in worldly matters, but sank
more and more as time went on, in general respect
and consideration.

There was a break in the deterioration, and apparently
a revival of old glories, when Peter Van
Vorst married his cousin, a brilliant beauty from
town, who had refused, as tradition asserts, half
the eligible men of her day, and accepted Peter for
what seemed a sudden and mysterious caprice. The
marriage was a nine days' wonder; but whatever the
reasons that prompted her strange choice&mdash;whether
2
love, indifference, or some feeling more complicated
and subtle; Elizabeth Van Vorst made no
effort to avert its consequences, but settled down in
silence to a life of monotonous poverty. She did
not even try, as less favored women have done under
harder circumstances, to keep in touch with the
world she had given up. She never wrote to her
old friends, never recalled herself, by her presence
in town, to her former admirers. As for the Homestead,
it wore, under the inert indifference of her
rule, the same neglected look which had prevailed
for years. The foliage grew in rank profusion about
the house till it shut out not only the sunlight, but
all view of the river. Perhaps Madam Van Vorst,
as people called her, disliked the idea of change; or
perhaps she grudged the cost of a day's labor to
cut the trees; or it might be that she liked the gloom
and the feeling of confinement, and had no desire to
feast her eyes on the river, after the fashion of the
Neighborhood. It reminded her too much, perhaps,
of the outside world.

She was a stately, handsome old lady, and made
an imposing appearance when she came into church
on Sunday, in the black silk gown which rustled with
an old-time dignity, and her puffs of snow-white
hair standing out against the rim of her widow's
bonnet. Her daughters, following timidly behind
her, seemed to belong to a different sphere; dull,
faded women, in shabby gowns which the village
girls would have disdained. If you spoke to them
after church, when the whole Neighborhood exchanges
greetings and discusses the news of the
3
week, they would answer you shyly, in embarrassed
monosyllables. Still, in some intangible way, you
felt the innate breeding, which lurked behind all the
uncouthness of voice and manner.

Their life, under their mother's training, had been
one long lesson in self-effacement; they never even
drove to the village without consulting her, or bought
a spool of cotton without her permission. The stress
of poverty, as time went on, grew less stringent at
the Homestead; but with Madam Van Vorst the
penury which had been first the result of necessity,
had grown to be second nature. She let the money
accumulate and made no change in their manner of
life. Her daughters had no books, no teachers; no
occupation but house-work; no interest beyond the
petty gossip of the country-side.

With Peter, the son, the downward process was
more evident and had taken deeper root. His voice
was more uncouth than that of his sisters and his
manner less refined; it was hard to distinguish him
if you saw him in church, from any farmer, ill at
ease in his Sunday clothes. He spent his days at
work on the farm, and his evenings, more often than
his mother dreamed of, at the bar in the village.
Like his sisters, he bowed beneath her iron rod and
lived in mortal fear of her displeasure. Yet he had
his plans, well defined, and frequently boasted (at
least at the village bar) of what he should do when
he became his own master.

With the sisters a certain inborn delicacy of feeling
prevented them from formulating, even to themselves,
those hopes and aspirations which, nevertheless,
4
lay dormant, needing only a sudden shock to
call them into life. When that shock came, and it
was known all over the Neighborhood that Madam
Van Vorst was dead, the news brought a mild sense
of loss, the feeling of a landmark removed; and people
hastened at once to the Homestead with sincere
condolences and offers of assistance to the daughters.
Cornelia and Joanna were stunned, but not entirely
with sorrow; rather with the sort of feeling that a
prisoner might experience, who finds himself by a
sudden blow, released from a chain which habit has
rendered bearable, and almost second nature, yet
none the less a chain.

It was not till the evening after the funeral that
this stifled feeling found expression. The day had
been fraught with a ghastly excitement that seemed
to give for the moment to these poor crushed beings
a fictitious importance. All the Neighborhood had
come to the funeral; some grand relations even had
journeyed up from town to do honor to the woman
whom they had ignored in her lifetime; these last
lingered for a solemn meal at the Homestead. The
whole affair seemed to bring the Van Vorst women
more in contact with the outside world than any
event since their father's death, many years before.
Sitting that evening, talking it all over, it might have
been some festivity that they were discussing, were
it not for their crape-laden gowns, and the tears
they were still shedding half mechanically, though
with no conscious insincerity.

"It was kind of the Schuyler Van Vorsts to come
up," said Cornelia, wistfully. "I thought they had
5
quite forgotten us&mdash;they are such fine people, you
know&mdash;but they were really very kind, quite as if
they took an interest."

"I'm glad the cake was so good," said the practical
Joanna. "I took special pains with it, for I
thought some of them might stay."

"It went off very nicely," said Cornelia, tearfully,
"very nicely indeed. Mrs. Schuyler Van Vorst
spoke of the cream being so good."

"She ate a good deal of it, I noticed."

"One thing I was sorry for," said Cornelia, reluctantly.
"I saw her looking at the furniture. You
know poor Mamma never would have anything done
to it."

The sisters looked mechanically about the familiar
room whose deficiencies had never been so glaringly
apparent. The Homestead drawing-room had been
re-furnished, with strict regard to economy many
years ago, after a fashion too antiquated to be beautiful,
and too modern to be interesting. The chairs
and sofa were covered with horse-hair, and decorated,
at intervals, with crochet anti-macassars. In
the centre of the room stood a marble-topped table,
upon which were ranged, at stiff angles, the Pilgrim's
Progress, Paradise Lost, and several books of
sermons. There were no other books and no pretty
knick-knacks; but some perennially blooming wax
flowers, religiously preserved beneath a glass case,
contrasted with the chill marble of the mantel-piece.
Above them hung one of the few relics of the
past&mdash;a hideous sampler worked by a colonial ancestress.
The room was much the worse for wear,
6
the wall-paper was dingy, the carpet faded to an
indefinite hue, some of the chairs were notoriously
unsafe, and the sofa had lacked one foot for years.

"I think," said Cornelia, with sudden energy, as
if roused at last to the truth of a self-evident proposition,
"I think it is about time that the room was
done over."

Joanna attempted no denial; but after a moment
she remarked tentatively, as if balancing the claims
of beauty against those of economy; "Some pretty
sateen, I suppose, for a covering would not cost
much."

Cornelia shook her head with melancholy decision.
"It would be quite useless to do anything with the
furniture," she declared, "if we didn't first change
the carpet and the wall-paper."

Joanna was silent in apparent acquiescence; and
Cornelia, after a moment's hesitation, brought out
a still bolder proposition. "I've been thinking," she
said "that we ought to have a piano. Of course I
can't&mdash;we can't either of us play," she went on in
hurried deprecation of Joanna's astonished looks,
"poor Mamma would never let us take lessons; but
people have them whether they play or not, and&mdash;it
would give such a nice, musical look to the room."

Joanna sat lost for a moment in awe over this
radical suggestion. "It would be very expensive,"
she said, practically "and&mdash;there are a great many
things we need more."

But the more imaginative Cornelia refused to be
daunted. "What if it is expensive!" she said boldly
"and if we don't actually need it, that's all the
7
more reason why it would be nice to have it. We've
never spent money on a single thing in all our lives
except for just what was necessary. Couldn't we
for once have something that isn't necessary, that
would be only&mdash;pleasant?"

Thus Cornelia struck the key-note of resistance
to that doctrine of utility which had enslaved their
lives, and Joanna, after the first shock of surprise,
followed willingly in her lead. It was decided that
the piano should be bought at once, and in discussing
this and other changes, time passed rapidly, and they
went to bed in a state of duly suppressed, but undoubted
cheerfulness. It was altogether quite the
pleasantest evening that they had spent for many
years, though they would not have admitted this for
the world, and sincerely believed themselves in great
affliction. There was another being in the house who
rejoiced in his freedom and meant to make the most
of it.

The next morning at breakfast the sisters might
have perceived had they been less engrossed in their
own thoughts, that Peter was meditating some communication,
which he found it hard to express. His
words, when he spoke at last, chimed in oddly with
his sisters' wishes. "I never," he said, speaking
very deliberately and looking about him in great
disgust, "I never saw a place that needed doing
over so badly as this does."

There was a moment's pause of astonishment; and
then Cornelia looked up in glad surprise. "Why,
Peter," she said, "I had no idea that you would
care"&mdash;
8

"Care!" said Peter, importantly. "Of course
I care. I've always meant to have the place fixed
up when&mdash;well, she couldn't live for ever, you
know" he broke off half apologetically, as he caught
the look of mute protest on his sisters' faces. "It
did all very well for her and for you," he went on,
coolly, "but it's not the sort of place I can bring
my wife to." The last words came out with an air
of indifference, that might have befitted the most
commonplace announcement.

Upon Peter's hearers, however, they fell like a
thunderbolt. It was several minutes before Cornelia
repeated, in a very low voice:

"Your&mdash;your wife, Peter?"

"Yes, my wife." Peter rose and faced his sisters
squarely, his hands in his pockets. He thrust out
his under lip, and his florid Dutch face wore an expression
of mingled defiance, exultation and embarrassment.
"Why, I've been married some time,"
he said. "You didn't suppose I was going to stay
single all my life, did you?"

"But who&mdash;who"&mdash;Cornelia's mind, moving with
unusual rapidity, had already passed in review and
rejected as improbable all the eligible young women
of the Neighborhood, with none of whom she had
ever seen Peter exchange two words. "Who can
it be, Peter?" she concluded, lamely.

"Is it&mdash;any one we know?" chimed in Joanna,
hopefully.

Peter looked them full in the face; he had always
held his sisters in some contempt. "You know her
well enough," he said, deliberately "or if you don't&mdash;you
9
ought to. She's a young lady who lives near
here, and her name is Malvina Jones."

There was a dead silence. The old Dutch clock
on the mantel-piece, which had kept its place undisturbed
through the trials and changes of several generations,
seemed to beat in the stillness loudly and
fiercely, almost as if it shared the consternation of
Peter's sisters, who stared at him aghast. Cornelia
was the first to speak. "Malvina Jones!" she repeated,
slowly. "You don't mean the&mdash;the girl
whose father keeps the bar?"

Peter flushed angrily. "There's only one Malvina
Jones that I know of" he declared, "and she's
my wife and will be the mistress of this house. And
so, if you don't like it, you can leave&mdash;that's all I
have to say."

With this conclusive remark Peter betook himself
to his usual avocations, and his sisters were left to
resign themselves to the situation as best they
might.

"Malvina Jones!" Joanna repeated, still lost in
astonishment.

"One of the village girls!" said Cornelia, bitterly,
"a&mdash;a bar-keeper's daughter."

Joanna seemed to hesitate. "That isn't the worst
of it," she said at last. "There are some very nice
girls in the village, you know, but Malvina Jones
is not&mdash;I'm afraid she really is not a very nice girl."

Cornelia was silent. She knew enough of the
petty gossip of the village to be aware that Joanna
was stating the case mildly. Before her mental vision
there rose a picture of Malvina as she had often
10
seen her on Sunday, with her glaring red hair, her
smart attire and her look of bold assurance, undisturbed
by the disapproving eyes of the congregation.
Then she thought of her mother, the stately old
dame whom they had been so proud of, even while
they feared her. She looked at the breakfast-table,
at the quaint, old-fashioned shapes of the glistening
silver and the Dutch willow-ware which had been
in the family since time immemorial; she thought
with affection even of the old horsehair furniture,
which must surely be preferable to such improvements
as Malvina might suggest, and she pictured
the bar-keeper's daughter entertaining her friends
in the room where Madam Van Vorst had received
with old-world stateliness the visits of the Neighborhood.
To poor Cornelia the family dignity&mdash;what
little there was left of it&mdash;seemed to be crumbling
to ashes.

"I don't think we need to bother now about&mdash;about
the piano," she said, and the words died away
in a sob.


11
Chapter II


It was a June morning twenty years later,
and Elizabeth's hands were full of June
roses.

"Look," she said, holding them out "how beautiful!"
She placed them in a flat china dish and
proceeded to arrange them, humming, as she did so,
a gay little tune from some favorite opera of the
day. The Misses Van Vorst, her aunts, who had
been talking rather seriously before the girl entered,
broke off in their conversation and brightened as
they watched her.

There had been times in Elizabeth's childhood
when the heart of each sister had been contracted
by a secret fear, which they concealed even from one
another, when they had offered up in seclusion fervent
prayers that certain hereditary characteristics
might not be revived in this treasure which fortune
had unexpectedly bestowed upon them. These
prayers had been to all appearance more than answered.
Elizabeth did not look like her mother.
It was true that the beautiful, wavy hair, which
grew in soft ripples on her forehead, showed in the
full glare of the sunshine or the firelight a trace,
a suspicion of the deep red which in her mother's
locks had been unpleasantly vivid; but with Elizabeth,
12
it was a warm Titian shade which would delight
an artist. In other respects, it was her grandmother
whom she resembled, as very old people in
the Neighborhood would sometimes inform you,
wondering to see the beauty and distinction which
had perversely skipped one generation, reproduced
in this bar-maid's daughter. Certainly it was from
Madam Van Vorst that the girl inherited the
haughty turn of the head and the instinctive pride
of carriage. The older woman's beauty may have
been more perfect. Elizabeth's features were admittedly
far from classical. Her nose tilted slightly,
the chin was too square, the red, pouting lips were
perhaps a trifle too full. But her skin was dazzlingly
fair and fresh, and there was a glow of color and
wealth of outline about her which disarmed criticism.
The eyes, under their long lashes, were large
and lustrous. Like her hair, they varied in different
lights, or perhaps it was in different moods. They
seemed a clear gray when she was thoughtful, blue
when she smiled, and they grew, in moments of grief
or acute emotion, singularly deep and dark. But
such moments had, at this period of her life, been
rare.

To her aunts, as they watched her that morning,
she was the visible embodiment of all those stifled
aspirations, to which Peter's marriage had apparently
given a fatal blow. They could think now without
bitterness of that great humiliation, and if they
spoke of their brother's wife, it was with due propriety
as "poor Malvina." They owed her after
all, a debt of gratitude, since she was Elizabeth's
13
mother, who had died most opportunely when Elizabeth
was a baby.

The girl had been their sole charge from the first,
for Peter concerned himself little about his motherless
child. His death, when she was still very young,
could hardly be considered an unmitigated affliction.
As for Elizabeth, it was chiefly remarkable
in being the occasion of her first black frock, on the
strength of which she gave herself airs towards her
less afflicted playmates.

Thus the Misses Van Vorst were free to carry out
certain cherished plans in regard to their niece's
future, which they had formed when, hanging over
her cradle, they had fondly traced a resemblance to
the grandmother after whom she had been named,
through some odd, remorseful freak of Peter's. Impelled,
as she grew older, by a wistful consciousness
of all that they had missed, they heroically resigned
themselves to part with her for a while that she
might enjoy the advantages of a very select and extremely
expensive school in town. And after five
years she returned to them, not over-burdened by
much abstruse knowledge, but with a graceful carriage,
a charming intonation, a considerable stock of
accomplishments, and the prettiest gowns of any girl
in the Neighborhood.

Her return was the signal for the changes at the
Homestead, which now made the old house a cheerful
place to live in. The sunlight, no longer excluded
by the overgrown foliage, flooded the drawing-room,
and from the long French windows, opening
out on the well-kept lawn, you caught a charming
14
glimpse of the river. The fire-place was decorated
in white and gold, the polished floor was strewn
with rugs. Amid the profusion of modern chairs and
tables and bric-à-brac were old heirlooms which
had mouldered in the attic for generations, un-thought
of and despised, till Elizabeth routed them
out and placed them, rather to her aunts' surprise,
in a conspicuous position. The walls were hung
with fine engravings, books and magazines were
scattered here and there. Across one corner stood
the much-coveted piano.

The improvement was not confined to the furniture.
The Misses Van Vorst, too, seemed to have
progressed and assumed a more modern air, in harmony
with their present surroundings. They were
old women now, and people of the present generation
placed carefully the prefix "Miss" before their
Christian names; but in many ways, they were
younger and certainly far happier than they were
twenty years before. It was Elizabeth who had
made the change, it was she who had filled their
narrow lives with a wonderful new interest. And
yet, it was on her account that they felt just then the
one anxiety which disturbed their satisfaction in
the warmth of her youth and beauty, nay, was
rather intensified because of it.

"We were saying, dear," Miss Cornelia could
not help observing after a moment "just as you
came in, that it is a pity the Neighborhood is so dull.
There is so little amusement for a young girl."

"We used to think it quite gay when we were
young," said Miss Joanna, her knitting-needles
15
clicking cheerfully as she talked. "There was always
a lawn-party at the Van Antwerps', and Mrs.
Courtenay was at home every Saturday, and then
the fair for the church."

"But Mrs. Courtenay doesn't stay at home any
longer," said Miss Cornelia, dejectedly, "and the
Van Antwerps haven't given a thing for ever so
long, and as for the fair&mdash;the church has everything
it needs now&mdash;steeple, font, everything, so
there is no object in having a fair."

"And so few people to buy if there were," sighed
Miss Joanna, becoming despondent in her turn. "I
quite miss it&mdash;I used to enjoy making things for it.
Really now, if it were not for knitting socks for
Mrs. Anderton's new babies, I should be quite at a
loss for something to do."

Elizabeth, who had turned and stared from one
to the other, as if in surprise at the introduction of
a new subject, here broke in with a soft little laugh.
"Well, auntie, Mrs. Anderton certainly keeps you
busy," she said, consolingly "and as for the fair&mdash;why,
I don't know that it would be such wild dissipation."
Insensibly at the last words, her mouth
drooped at the corners, the eyes, which an instant
before had sparkled with amusement, grew thoughtful.
A slight cloud of discontent seemed to drift
over the buoyant freshness of her mood.

Miss Cornelia observed it and continued to lament.
"Well, at least, a fair would be something,"
she insisted "and then in old times there used to
be dances. If you went out to tea&mdash;oftener, my
dear&mdash;even that would be a diversion."
16

The cloud on Elizabeth's face deepened. She
bent down with elaborate care to place the last rose
in position. "Oh, I don't know that it matters
much," she said, and there was a sudden hardness
in her tone. "There are no men for a dance, and
as for the tea-parties&mdash;they don't amuse me very
much. There are always the Andertons, or Johnstons,
or both; and they talk about Mrs. Anderton's
babies, of Mrs. Johnston's rheumatism, or the way
the village girls dress; and the Rector asks me to
take a class in Sunday-school, and looks shocked
when I refuse; and&mdash;and it is all stupid and tiresome.
I&mdash;I s-sometimes&mdash;I hate this place, and all
the people in it," Elizabeth broke off, with a sound
not unlike a sob.

Her aunts were paralyzed. This outburst of revolt
was to them an entirely new phase in the girl's
development. They did not attempt any response,
or rebuke, and Elizabeth, after a moment, went over
and kissed them each remorsefully. "There, don't
mind me," she said. "I'm a horrid, discontented
wretch." Then, as if to put an end to the subject,
she added quickly: "I'm going to drive to Bassett
Mills. Is there anything I can do for you?"

Her aunts gladly accepted the change of mood.

"It's a lovely morning for a drive, dear," said
Miss Joanna, "and will do you good. But I wish,
if you go, you would stop at the Rectory&mdash;the baby
is ill, so the butcher tells me, and I have some beef-tea
I'd like you to take."

Elizabeth's smile again lit up her face into its
former brilliance. "What would you do without the
17
butcher, Aunt Joanna?" she asked. "He's a perfect
mine of information. Did he have any other
news this morning?"

"Only that he had just come from the Van Antwerps'&mdash;they
are up at last for the summer."

"Are they," said Elizabeth, carelessly. "Ah, well,
they don't make much difference, one way or the
other." She seemed to reflect a moment, while again
her face clouded. "If I go to the Rectory," she
said abruptly, "I suppose I must stop to see Aunt
Rebecca. She will see me pass, and she is always
complaining that I neglect her."

The Misses Van Vorst again looked distressed.
The aunt of whom Elizabeth spoke, Malvina's sister-in-law,
kept a small dry-goods shop, much patronized
by the Neighborhood, and had risen considerably
above the original position of the family. Yet the
older ladies of the Homestead could never be reminded
of her existence without a sharp recollection
of a painful chapter in the family history. Had
they consulted only their wishes, Elizabeth would
never have been informed of the connection. They
were just women, however, and admitted the claims
of Elizabeth's only relation on her mother's side, and
one who had a daughter, too, of about the girl's
own age.

"Of course, my dear," Miss Cornelia said at
last, reluctantly, "we wouldn't have you neglect
your aunt."

"No, poor thing," said Joanna "we wouldn't
have you hurt her feelings for the world. So perhaps
you would better stop there, my dear; and if
18
you do, will you get me some sewing-silk from the
store?"

This proved by no means the only commission with
which Elizabeth was burdened when she started,
half an hour later; for Miss Joanna had had time
to remember several other things she wanted from
the store, to say nothing of the beef-tea for the Rector's
wife, and numerous messages of advice and
sympathy, which the girl was earnestly charged not
to forget. Miss Cornelia had no commissions, and
merely asked Elizabeth to remember, when she came
home, every one whom she had seen, to inquire of
the Johnstons, if she met them, how their grandmother
was, and to notice, if she saw the Van Antwerps,
if they had their new carriage, and what
Mrs. Bobby had on. At last Elizabeth drove off,
in the old-fashioned pony-chaise, behind the fat
white pony whose age was wrapped in obscurity,
and who trod, with the leisurely indifference of a
well-bred carriage-horse, the road which he knew
by heart.

It was a pleasant, shady road, that ran between
stone fences, across which you caught the scent of
honey-suckle. Beyond were fine places, once the
pride of the Neighborhood, now for the most part
neglected, or turned into pasturage for cows. The
trees interlacing, formed an arch over-head, through
which the sunlight flickered in long, slanting rays;
the air was very still, except for the soft hum of
bees, and a gentle wind that occasionally rustled the
foliage and caressed the petals of the wild-roses,
which grew in careless profusion along the road-side.
19
Here and there, in sheltered nooks, wild violets
still lingered, and the fresh green grass in the
fields was thickly strewn with buttercups and daisies.
But for all this beauty of the early summer Elizabeth
seemed to have no eyes. Her brows were knit
and her face clouded, and now and then she gave a
vicious pull to the white pony's reins more as a relief
to her own feelings than from any hope of hastening
the movements of that dignified animal.

Her thoughts matched the day as little as her
looks. Her mind still reverted with remorse to the
outburst of an hour before. Why had she displayed
that childish petulance, and given audible expression
to the discontent which had smouldered unsuspected
for many months? To speak of it was useless and
only distressed her aunts; it was not their fault if
the place was dull. And then she could, as a rule,
amuse herself well enough. There were always
drives and walks, the garden and the flowers, her
books and her music, a hundred resources in which
she found unceasing pleasure. There was even to
her warm vitality a delight just then in the mere
physical fact of living. And yet the times were
growing more frequent day by day, when all this
would fail her, when she would long passionately
for novelty, for excitement, for something&mdash;she
hardly knew what. There were desperate moments
when it seemed to her that she would welcome any
change whatsoever, when she thought that even
storm and stress might be preferable to dull monotony.

After all, it was not the dullness of the place which
20
lay at the root of her discontent. There was another
trouble which went far deeper of which she never
spoke; yet it affected her whole attitude towards
the world, and more especially the Neighborhood.
She did not feel at home in the small, charmed circle
of those who knew each other so well, not even with
the girls with whom she had played as a child.
There had always been a tacit assumption of superiority
on their part, which Elizabeth instinctively
felt and resented. The most disagreeable episode
in her life was a quarrel with one of her playmates,
in which the latter had won the last word by an
angry taunt against Elizabeth's mother, who was
"a horrid, common woman, whom no one in the
Neighborhood, would speak to&mdash;her mother had said
so." Elizabeth, paralyzed, could think of no retort,
but walked home in silence, shedding bitter tears of
rage and mortification. She did not repeat the remark
to her aunts&mdash;it was too painful and she somehow
suspected too true; but that night she cried
herself to sleep and had consoling dreams of a time
when she should be a great personage, and able
to turn the tables on her tormentors. This was a
long time ago; but the old wound still rankled, and
she held herself proudly aloof from her former playmates.
They, on their part pronounced her hard to
get on with, and their mothers made no effort to encourage
the intimacy. In the conservative society
of the Neighborhood, Peter's marriage was still
vividly remembered, and could not easily be forgiven.
Elizabeth was pretty and to all appearance,
well-bred, but still people thought of her antecedents
21
and maintained towards her an attitude of doubt.
It was the perception of this fact, the consciousness
of having begun life at a disadvantage, which embittered
Elizabeth's thoughts as she drove through
the country lanes that June morning.

The sun was high in the heavens when she reached
Bassett Mills, a nondescript place, neither town nor
village, and much over-shadowed by the glories of
Cranston, not ten miles away. "The Mills" is
not very prosperous, but it has its factory, and the
mill-stream, dashing precipitously through its midst,
lends some picturesqueness to the squalid houses on
its banks. There was a certain life and movement
this morning about the steep High Street, down
which the white pony took his leisurely way. A
stream of factory people passed by to their noon-day
dinner; the street was full of wagons and carriages
from the Neighborhood. Elizabeth saw the
Van Antwerp dog-cart standing in front of the hardware
shop, and caught a smile and bow from Mrs.
Bobby, which surprised her by their graciousness.
Later on she met the Courtenays, whom she knew
better, but who greeted her more coldly. Elizabeth's
own bow was stiff, and the cloud which Mrs. Bobby's
cordiality had dispelled, again darkened her face.

She went on to the Rectory, but here she found
that the baby's illness had developed into measles,
and she could deposit her beef-tea at the door and
take her leave with a clear conscience. Outside she
stood in the hot sun debating if she should or should
not stop to see her aunt and cousin. It was a long
time since she had been there, and her aunt would
22
be sure to assail her with reproaches. Amanda, too,
would feel injured, and look the spiteful things
which she never actually said. But then Elizabeth
could usually rise superior to any spitefulness that
Amanda might display. She felt on the whole very
kindly towards her cousin, she liked to show her
pretty gowns, and her good-nature had even stood
the test of several bungling attempts on Amanda's
part to imitate them. There were moments when,
in the dearth of society, Elizabeth would turn with
a certain affection to this uncongenial cousin, who
at other times jarred upon her greatly.

It was the remembrance of Miss Joanna's commissions
that on this occasion turned the scale in
favor of the intended visit. Elizabeth left the white
pony, who would stand an indefinite time, and entered
the small dry-goods shop, where her aunt or
Amanda generally presided. It was empty. Elizabeth
hesitated a moment, then she crossed the hall
that led to the living-rooms of the family. Here she
paused in astonishment. From behind the closed
door of the parlor came the sound of a man's voice;
a rich, barytone voice singing from Tannhäuser the
song of the Evening Star. Elizabeth waited till it
was over; then she opened the door and went in.

Chapter III


The young man who had just sung was still
at the piano, softly playing variations
on the same air. She gave him one
hurried glance. He was tall and fair, with blue
eyes and a silky blonde moustache, and he wore
a velveteen coat, much the worse for wear, and
a turn-down collar that showed to advantage the
fine outlines of his throat and the graceful poise
of his head. These details Elizabeth grasped
at once before her gaze wandered to her aunt and
Amanda, who were sitting idle as she had never
before seen them in the morning, with eyes intent
on the young man at the piano. Elizabeth noticed
that Amanda had on her Sunday frock and her hair
very much frizzed.

The girl had entered so softly that the three
people already in the room did not at first notice
her presence. When they at last did so, it seemed
to cause something of a shock. Her aunt and
Amanda stared at her in silence, and Amanda turned
a trifle pale. The young man rose from the piano
and looked at her intently for a moment with his
bright blue eyes; then he re-seated himself and went
on playing, but much more softly, and as if hardly
conscious of what he did.
24

Elizabeth's aunt was the first to recover herself,
and upon second thought it occurred to her that
her niece had arrived at an opportune moment&mdash;when
she and Amanda had on their best clothes,
and were entertaining company. This reflection
tempered the usual austerity of her greeting. "Why,
Elizabeth, is that you? You're quite a stranger. It
isn't often you honor us with your company."

"You know," said Elizabeth, quite used to the
formula of reproach and excuse, with which these
visits invariably opened "the white pony has been
lame, and I have driven out very little."

"And you couldn't come on your wheel, I suppose?
Nothing short of a carriage would do for
you. I wonder you don't insist on a groom in top-boots.
But well, never mind," Aunt Rebecca went
on, feeling that she had sufficiently maintained her
dignity "you're very welcome now, I'm sure, and
you're just in time to hear some music. This is
Paul Halleck, who has been kind enough to sing
for us. Mr. Halleck, this is Amanda's cousin Elizabeth,
whom you've heard us speak of." There was
an odd note of grudging satisfaction in her voice
as she made the introduction. Mrs. Jones's feeling
towards her niece was a complex one, characterized
on the one hand, by an involuntary sense of resentment
at the elevation of Malvina's girl, on the other,
by an equally involuntary pride in the connection.
The latter sensation predominated when she introduced
Elizabeth to a stranger whom she wished to
impress.
25

Elizabeth's chief feeling was one of annoyance,
and it brought an angry flush to her cheek. Then
she caught the look in the young man's eyes, as
he rose and bowed with much deference; and her
own eyes fell and again she blushed, but not with
anger.

"I have had the pleasure of seeing Miss Van
Vorst before," said Paul Halleck, "though she has
not, of course, noticed me."

"Why, yes, of course," said Elizabeth's aunt, still
in high good humor, "you've seen her when you
were out sketching. You see, Elizabeth, he's a
painter as well as a singer; he's quite a genius, altogether.
We find him a great acquisition to our
parties here at The Mills. And to think that he
was born here, and lived here part of his life! You
remember the Hallecks that went West when you
were a child? They settled in Chicago, you know.
He only came to New York awhile ago, and thought
he'd look up his folks in this place. But there,
Elizabeth, sit down, and perhaps Mr. Halleck will
give us another tune."

Elizabeth silently took the chair the young man
placed for her, while her aunt still talked on volubly.
The girl was bewildered by what she heard. She
could not imagine this handsome young singer, with
his air of picturesque Bohemia, as an acquisition to
the parties of Bassett Mills; nor did he seem at
home in her aunt's parlor. She glanced about the
commonplace, gaudy little room, every detail of
which impressed itself upon her with a new sense
26
of its crudeness; the plush-covered furniture, staring
wall-paper, the lace anti-macassars, the photographs
of the family, the men in high hats, the
women simpering in their Sunday clothes. It did
not seem the fit atmosphere for an artist. And then,
with a sudden, sharp misgiving, Elizabeth looked at
Amanda, and asked herself for a moment if she
could be the attraction. The doubt vanished instantly.
Poor Amanda was not pretty at the best
of times, and there was a sullen look on her face
just then that made her appear at her worst. She
had a dull, pasty skin and very light eyes. All the
color seemed to be concentrated in her hair, which
was a deep, dark red, all the more striking for the
contrast to her pale face. The gown she wore, of
a bright yellow, was peculiarly successful in bringing
out the faded tints of her complexion and the
jarring vividness of her hair.

Amanda at that moment felt to the full the unkindness
of fate. She had not shared for an instant
her mother's gratification at Elizabeth's entrance. It
was hard, she thought, that, having arrayed herself
in her best, and struggled long to look beautiful, she
should be completely over-shadowed by Elizabeth
in the cool white gown and shady hat, which had a
provoking air of not being her best, but merely her
natural and everyday attire. Amanda had seen, as
well as Elizabeth, the look in Paul's eyes. Was it
fair, she asked herself, that she should share her
good things with Elizabeth, who had so many of her
own? And so Amanda sat silent and sullen, while
27
her mother talked on, and Halleck ran his fingers
over the keys, as if he would fain be playing.

"What shall I sing?" he asked abruptly, in the
first pause, and looking at Elizabeth as if her wishes
alone were of any consequence.

"Oh, the Evening Star again," she responded
eagerly. "I only heard the end of it, and it brought
up so many delightful memories."

So Halleck sang the song again. A voice, artistically
modulated, filled the little room, which vanished
for Elizabeth. She saw pilgrims filing past in slow
procession, Tannhäuser struggling against the
power of the Venusberg, Elizabeth kneeling in her
penitent's dress before the cross. The whole Wagnerian
drama unrolled itself before her eyes while
the song lasted. And then, as the last note died
away, she came back to the present with a start, and
realized that the young man who had just afforded
her this pleasure was handsomer far than any Wolfram
she had ever seen before.

"Ah, thank you," she said, drawing a long breath.
"That is so beautiful. It is so long since I have
heard any music."

"You are fond of it?" said Halleck, eagerly.

"Yes," she responded, earnestly.

"Ah, I saw it&mdash;I was sure of it," he declared.
"You have the artistic temperament. I saw it in
your face at once."

Elizabeth blushed for the third time that morning,
and now with a distinct sense of pleasure. Amanda,
too, flushed a dull red. She was not quite certain
28
what the artistic temperament might be, but it was
clearly one of those good things of which Elizabeth
had an unfair monopoly.

"You play or sing yourself, of course?" Halleck
went on.

"Oh, I play a little," Elizabeth pouted out her
full under-lip, in charming deprecation of her own
powers. "I am ashamed, before a real musician,
to say that I play at all."

"I am not a real musician, alas!" said Halleck,
"only a dabbler in music, as I am in art." A
thoughtful look came into his blue eyes, and he went
on absently playing fragments from Tannhäuser.
"I am glad you like that," he said, abruptly. "You
remember the heroine was called Elizabeth."

"Yes," said Elizabeth, "I remember." It gave
her an odd little thrill of pleasure to hear him pronounce
her name, and yet she wondered if his remark
were not too personal to be in good taste.
"But I don't think I am at all like that Elizabeth,"
she added, after a moment, following out his suggestion
in spite of this doubt.

"No, perhaps not," said Halleck, regarding her
with a calm scrutiny, in which he seemed to appraise
her no longer as a woman, but purely from an
artistic point of view. "You are not exactly that
type; you have more life and color, less spirituality,
perhaps; but you are fair, and your hair would do
admirably. You would make a beautiful picture
with your hair unbound, kneeling before the
cross."

"I have never had my picture painted," Elizabeth
29
murmured, trying to imagine herself in a penitent's
garb.

"Will you let me try it?"

Elizabeth smiled and assented, deciding that no
long acquaintance was necessary, when it was a
question of having her picture painted, in a costume
which she was quite determined should be becoming.
She sat mentally reviewing the resources of her
wardrobe, while Halleck struck sonorous chords on
the piano, and asked if she recognized this or that
Wagnerian theme, upon which he proceeded to extemporize.
Amanda and her mother were distinctly
left out, and the latter began to repent of her first
satisfaction in her niece's visit. She broke in at
last, brusquely, upon the very midst of the love-music
from "Tristan and Isolde." "Well, I don't
think much of this Wagner," she said. "His music
all sounds the same&mdash;a lot of queer noises, with no
tune to them. What I like now is 'Home, Sweet
Home,' or 'Nancy Lee'&mdash;something real nice and
catchy."

"I can play those, too," said Halleck, good-humoredly,
and immediately played the first mentioned
air, with variations of his own improvisation. At
the end of it he rose from the piano. "Won't you
play for me now," he said to Elizabeth.

"Oh, no, not after you." Elizabeth shook her
head and rose to her feet, with a sudden recollection
of the white pony and her aunt's dinner-hour.
"Some other day," she said, "I'll be very glad to
play for you, but really now I have not the time&mdash;or
the courage." She spoke with a pretty, smiling
30
deference, and she held out her hand, which he took
in a long, lingering grasp. There was a soft glow
of color in her cheeks, her eyes were cast down till
he could see only her long lashes. "Thank you so
much," she said "for the music." Then she drew
her hand away from his and kissed her aunt and
Amanda, with an unwonted display of affection.
She felt an odd sense of excitement, a wish to be
friendly with all the world.

Neither her aunt nor Amanda seemed to share it.
They did not try to detain her, and Halleck, though
he looked disappointed, said nothing. They all three
escorted her to the door of the shop, where the
white pony stood patiently enduring the heat and the
flies. Elizabeth lingered over her farewells. She
wished to ask her new acquaintance to come to see
her, but disliked doing so before her aunt and cousin.
It was he who finally said, leaning over her as he
placed the reins in her hand: "And&mdash;a&mdash;how about
that picture? May I come to see you about it?"

Elizabeth's eyes were still hidden as she answered
demurely: "I am sure I&mdash;we shall be very glad to
see you at the Homestead."

And then she drove off, and the others stood for a
moment and looked after her in silence.

"She&mdash;she's pretty&mdash;isn't she," said Amanda,
suddenly speaking for the first time since Elizabeth
had appeared. Her voice, even to herself, sounded
harsh and grating. Her lips were very dry.

Halleck started and looked at her as if reminded
of her existence. Then a smile stole over his face
and sparkled in his handsome blue eyes.
31

"Yes, she's rather pretty," he answered, carelessly
"but&mdash;a little disappointing on a close view. However,
she'll do very well as a model&mdash;she's picturesque,
at least."

Amanda drew a long breath of sudden and intense
relief.


32

Chapter V


"And so you say this young man lives at
The Mills, my dear?" Miss Cornelia
paused, the heavy, elaborately chased
tea-pot suspended in her hand. Her gentle, near-sighted
eyes looked anxiously across the table at
Elizabeth.

It was the first time that the girl had spoken of
her new acquaintance, though it was now some time
since her return from Bassett Mills, and she had told
at once of the measles at the Rectory. This piece
of news, however, had lasted them well through
dinner, and in the country it is improvident to use up
all one's information at once. Perhaps Elizabeth
thought of this; or it might be that the other item
did not strike her as of any special importance. She
only mentioned it very casually at tea-time; but her
aunts' anxiety was easily aroused at any suggestion
of new acquaintances at Bassett Mills.

"I don't think he lives at The Mills," Elizabeth
made answer now reluctantly to Miss Cornelia's
question. "I think he&mdash;he is just staying there&mdash;I
believe Aunt Rebecca said something about his
coming from Chicago. But his family used to live
at The Mills."

"You don't mean those Hallecks who went West
33
a long time ago?" exclaimed Miss Joanna. "Do you
remember, sister?&mdash;the man was in jail the most of
the time. The children used to play on the road
behind the church&mdash;poor little neglected things, I
was quite worried about them. It was a relief, I
remember, when they all went away."

Elizabeth found this piece of ancient history peculiarly
inopportune.

"Well, that was a long time ago, Aunt Joanna,"
she said. "It doesn't matter, I suppose, so much
what people's parents were like. Mr. Halleck is
very nice himself. He is an artist, and he wants to
paint my picture." She brought out this last information,
which she had been longing to tell for some
time, with a certain triumph; but it fell unexpectedly
flat.

"An artist!" Miss Joanna repeated. "Dear me!
One of those little Hallecks who used to play in
the road."

"To paint your picture, my dear?" repeated Miss
Cornelia still more doubtfully. "When he has only
met you once! I am afraid he is rather a pushing
young man. But of course, dear, you won't encourage
him."

Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her plate; her
cheeks were painfully flushed and she bit her lips to
keep back the scalding tears that rose to her eyes.
"I don't think he is pushing," she murmured, but
she said no more. How could she explain to her
aunts the vast difference that existed between this
young man and any other friend of Amanda's?
They were dear, good women, but so hopelessly
34
narrow and antiquated, with their little old-fashioned
ideas of propriety, their distinctions founded
on the conventional laws of the Neighborhood.
Elizabeth, too, was not without an involuntary respect
for these distinctions. She had her full share
of the pride of birth which was instinctive in every
Van Vorst, even in the most ignorant country lout
that had ever borne the family name and lowered
the family credit. With Elizabeth it was only intensified,
perhaps, by a doubt of her own position.
But then she belonged to the new generation; and
there was a side of her nature that recognized the
futility of these old traditions. Elizabeth did not
analyze her feelings; she was only conscious of a
vague sense of revolt, a desire to beat her wings as
it were, against the cages of conventional distinctions,
and test her powers of flight.

But she did not put all this into words. Her aunts
would not have understood. She did not understand
herself. She rose from the tea-table presently,
with a murmured excuse, leaving the food on her
plate untasted, to Miss Joanna's great distress, and
wandered into the drawing-room and sat down at
the piano. The keys seemed to respond with unusual
readiness to her touch, the music expressed in
some vague way what she could not put into words.
She played on restlessly, feverishly, for more than
an hour, passing from one thing to another; Chopin
nocturnes, waltzes, Hungarian dances, fragments
from Wagner; anything she could remember.

The drawing-room remained dim for the sake of
coolness; it was unlighted except for a lamp at a
35
corner-table, beside which Miss Joanna sat with her
knitting. As Elizabeth played she nodded comfortably
and presently fell asleep. This was always
the effect of Elizabeth's playing; she said she found
it very soothing. Miss Cornelia sat upright in an
old-fashioned, high-backed chair close to the piano.
She moved her head in time to the music, and the
thin little silvery curls that framed in her worn,
delicate face seemed to sway in unison with the
melody. She wore a black gown, a trifle antiquated
in fashion but falling about her in graceful folds, and
some rich old lace softened the outlines of her throat.
There was a gentle, tremulous dignity about her
nowadays. Miss Cornelia was very happy in moments
like these. It was touching to see the pride
she took in Elizabeth's music. But after awhile
this evening the girl let her hands drop on the keys,
and said impatiently: "Oh, it's no use, I can't say
what I want to say. The music's in me, but it won't
come out. If you could have heard that man to-day
at Aunt Rebecca's."

"Do you mean that young Halleck, my dear?"
said Miss Cornelia in surprise, and pronouncing his
name with evident distaste. "I didn't know that he
played."

"He can do anything," Elizabeth declared. "He
paints, he can improvise by the hour, he sings as well
as any opera-singer, and&mdash;he is very handsome. He
would make a superb Lohengrin or Tristan," she
added, thoughtfully "only, unfortunately, his voice
is barytone. I wonder why Wagner showed such
partiality to tenors."
36

"But he is not&mdash;going on the stage, is he, my
dear?" asked Miss Cornelia, tentatively. She felt
more anxiety than pleasure at hearing of this paragon.

"I don't know," said Elizabeth, "and it doesn't
much matter. I am not to know him, you see, because
his people used to live in the village years
ago, and Aunt Joanna saw him playing on the road."
She spoke bitterly.

"But, my dear, I&mdash;we never meant anything of
the kind," protested Miss Cornelia. But Elizabeth
went on without heeding her.

"Of course I know the rules of the Neighborhood.
They would no more think of knowing a
young man from Bassett Mills than they would a
convict. But I don't really belong to the Neighborhood;
I'm only on the outskirts, as it were&mdash;tolerated
for your sake and for Grandmamma's. I'm
tired of being a sort of nondescript&mdash;neither flesh,
fowl, nor good red herring." The girl's face was
hard, but she spoke quietly, in a matter-of-fact tone,
as if stating inevitable truths.

Miss Cornelia sat mute, bewildered, her whole
soul wrung by a powerless resentment against fate.
If by any sacrifice on her part she could have provided
for Elizabeth congenial society&mdash;the charming
young girls and attractive young men of whom she
and her sister had often dreamed&mdash;she would have
made it thankfully; but with all her love, there was
nothing&mdash;or there seemed to her nothing that she
could do. They had given Elizabeth every advantage,
she was beautiful and charming; and the result
37
of it all was that she felt herself to be "a sort
of nondescript, neither flesh, fowl, nor good red herring."
It was a very bitter thought for Miss Cornelia.

Elizabeth, seeing this, felt remorseful for the
second time that day. "Don't look so unhappy,
auntie," she said, quickly. "It's not your fault&mdash;no,
nor mine either; and, I suppose, it's not the fault
of the Neighborhood. People can't help being narrow
and conservative; they were born so. But then,
Aunt Cornelia, when&mdash;when I don't have so many
friends, you can't expect me to draw the line so
awfully closely." Something like a sob crept into the
girl's voice, but she went on with hardly a pause:
"You mustn't think that I would want to know&mdash;any
one. This man isn't like the rest of Amanda's
friends. Only wait till you hear him sing&mdash;you
would lose your heart, I'm sure, on the spot. And
now, confess, auntie, you would like me to have my
picture painted. The girls at school used to say
that I would make a glorious picture. Do you think
I would make a pretty picture, auntie?" She went
over to Miss Cornelia and put her arms around her,
looking up into her face with laughing, brilliant
eyes, from which all bitterness had disappeared.

"My darling." Miss Cornelia, bewildered by the
quick change of mood, could not find words. She
thought that Elizabeth would make the prettiest picture
in the world; but to have told her so would
have been to run counter to all her ideas of propriety.
So she finally said, with due regard for accepted
formulas: "You shouldn't think so much about
38
looks, Elizabeth. If you are good, that's the main
thing."

"Of course, it's the main thing," Elizabeth assented,
"but I'm afraid if it came to a choice, I'd
rather be pretty, auntie, and so would most people."
She ended with a light little laugh, and Miss Cornelia,
in spite of her principles, attempted no rebuke.

The look of gaiety soon faded from Elizabeth's
face. With a quick, impatient little sigh, she walked
over to the window, and looked out into the night.
It was still and sultry; heavy storm clouds were
gathering and obscured the sky. The old elm trees,
growing close about the house, cast sombre shadows;
they seemed to keep out what little air there was.
Elizabeth, as she leaned her hot cheek against the
cool glass of the window-pane, felt again a sense of
stifling, of being in a cage. It was useless to beat
her wings; life was outside, but she could not reach
it. "Oh, I would give anything in the world," she
thought "just to breathe, to be free, to know what
life is."

Suddenly she turned around with a start. There
was a voice in the hall; some one spoke her name.
A moment later a young man was advancing towards
her across the dimly-lighted room. Mechanically she
went to meet him. She did not think of her aunts,
she did not think of anything but his presence.

"Have I&mdash;come too soon?" Paul Halleck asked,
as he took her hand.


39

Chapter VI


Elizabeth drove again, a few weeks later,
through shady, fragrant lanes, on her way
to Bassett Mills. It was early in the morning,
but the sun was already hot. The wild-roses
along the road-side had mostly departed, the grass
in the fields had a parched look. It was a long time
since any rain had fallen, and the roads were thick
with dust. All the freshness of the early summer
had faded. But for these signs of premature blight
and the scorching effect of the sun, Elizabeth seemed
to have no eyes.

She drove along in a happy dream. There was a
brilliant color in her cheeks, a radiant light in her
eyes. She bloomed like a rose that has unfolded
every petal to the summer sunshine. The fields
through which she passed were not the familiar pasture-lands
and "places" that skirted the road to
Bassett Mills; they were the flowery meadows of
poetic Arcadia, on the road that led to Paradise.

It was something of a bore, under the circumstances,
that she must first of all go to Bassett Mills,
but Miss Joanna had intrusted her with numerous
commissions, that she could not very well refuse to
discharge. That was the reason why she had started
so early. There was a brook in a meadow near by;
40
a brook shaded by weeping willow trees, under which
nowadays a young artist sat sketching for many
hours at a time. Elizabeth's drives, or walks had
for the last few weeks led no further. But to-day
she had decided to go first to Bassett Mills, and be
back in time for the usual engagement, of which
her aunts knew nothing.

The affair was not really so clandestine. There
was no reason why she should have kept it secret
beyond a vague embarrassment, an unwillingness to
speak about the one subject that occupied her
thoughts. Miss Cornelia and Miss Joanna had,
after the one protest, yielded to the inevitable;
they had not even discouraged young Halleck's
visits to their niece. They had gone so far as
to admit, when he had come to tea at the Homestead,
and sung and played for them afterwards
for hours, that he was an extremely talented
young man. It had been a most successful
evening, Miss Joanna had not even gone to sleep.
And yet, with it all, in both sisters there was some
innate distrust, some lingering prejudice perhaps,
that prevented them from succumbing entirely to the
charm of his handsome face and beautiful voice.
They were civil to him&mdash;painfully civil; but they did
not welcome him as they would have welcomed young
Frank Courtenay, who used to stare at Elizabeth in
church every Sunday, but had never apparently mustered
up courage to come and see her. He was
much under the influence of his mother, who considered
Elizabeth's hair "conspicuous" and had remarked
that it was bad taste for a young girl to
41
be too well dressed&mdash;a fault that could not in justice
be alleged against her own daughters.

Elizabeth, too, might have welcomed the visits of
young Courtenay. There had been times when she
had doubted, sadly, if she were really so pretty as
the girls at school had seemed to think. But these
times were past, and she had not a thought to spare
for Frank Courtenay's heavy, commonplace good
looks. Paul Halleck had assured her many times
that she was beautiful, and had sketched her in every
variety of pose, in that impressionistic style which
Elizabeth had secretly thought rather ugly, before
she learned to regard it as the last word in Art.

Elizabeth had learned many other things in the
last few weeks. Halleck undertook her education in
all artistic and literary matters, showing her how
little she had hitherto known of this or that great
light. He quoted Swinburne and Rossetti; he read
her extracts from Maeterlinck and Ibsen; he opened
for her the treasures of that school which Nordau
calls degenerate. He had all the intellectual and
artistic jargon of the day at his tongue's end. She
sat at his feet and devoutly learned it all.

She knew his history, now. It was very romantic,
and it lost nothing in the telling. He had a keen
eye for artistic effect, and spared not one sordid detail
of his early surroundings which served to throw
into more brilliant relief his subsequent career. He
told how the possession of a lovely childish soprano
had raised him literally from the gutter, and procured
him a position as boy soloist in a Chicago
church, and how, later on, a patron was found, who
42
sent him abroad to study. He had wandered from
one European centre to another; learned to play in
Dresden and to paint in Paris, and developed a fine
barytone voice, of which great things were prophesied.
In fact, he was a universal genius, and could
do anything, except apparently earn a living, which
indeed has been always hard for genius. And so at
last he drifted back to Chicago, where he sang for
a while in the same church where he had begun his
career; but finally left for some reason or another,
and tried his fortune in New York. He was debating
now whether to go abroad again to study in
earnest for the stage, and meanwhile he was on a
walking tour, sketching about the country. He had
come to Bassett Mills for the sake of old associations,
and had stayed&mdash;well, he left it to Elizabeth to
imagine why he stayed.

All this was very interesting and romantic; far
more so, Elizabeth thought, than any ordinary affair
could have been, with some commonplace
youth of the neighborhood. She had only one
regret; she could not help wishing in her heart that
Paul's early surroundings had been, if not more
exalted, less familiar. She would have preferred
him to have no associations with, no friends at,
Bassett Mills. The place seemed to her, as she
drove through it that morning, so hopelessly common,
so unusually prosaic. The ugly, sordid houses,
the people with their faces of dull stolidity, jarred
upon the ecstatic tone of her mood. She could not
imagine that genius could be born in such surroundings.
43

The discordant note was still more striking when,
having discharged the greater part of her commissions,
she entered the dry-goods shop, and found
Aunt Rebecca in her most trying humor.

"So that's you, Elizabeth," she said, looking her
niece severely up and down, while her thin lips
moved at the corners. "It seems to me you're very
much dressed up, driving round these dusty roads.
The way you wear white is a caution! But I suppose
for a millionaire like you it don't matter about
the washing."

Elizabeth bit her lip. "I'm not a millionaire, you
know Aunt Rebecca," she said, "but I like to wear
white, and it's as cheap as anything in the end. Is
Amanda in?" she added quickly, anxious to stave
off further criticism. "I'll go back and see her if
she is."

"She's in the parlor," said Amanda's mother,
shortly. "She's got a headache. I guess she don't
feel like seeing company," she added hastily, but
the words came too late. Elizabeth had already left
the shop, and was crossing the narrow, dark little
hall that led to the parlor. Her heart beat rapidly
as she did so. She felt an odd, utterly irrational
desire to feast her eyes on the spot where she had
first experienced such new and delightful sensations.

There was no music in the room now, no air of
festivity. The atmosphere was close and musty, the
sun poured in at the window beside which Amanda
sat sewing. She bent closely over her work, her
skin was more pasty than ever and her eyes were
44
red and swollen. Elizabeth remembered her aunt's
words about the headache; otherwise she might
have thought that her cousin had been crying. She
went over and kissed her with a friendliness born
of her own superabundant joy. The lips she touched
were dry and hot. Amanda did not respond to the
caress. She stared stupidly at Elizabeth, as if half
dazed by her sudden entrance.

"How are you, Amanda?" Elizabeth said. "I'm
sorry you have a headache. Perhaps it's the heat.
It's a terribly hot day, and the roads are so dusty.
Aunt Rebecca implied that my dress showed that very
plainly. It was clean this morning&mdash;does it really
look so badly?" She walked over to the mirror and
inspected herself critically, setting her hat straight
and adjusting the white ribbon about her throat. It
was a long narrow glass, framed in black walnut,
and there was a shelf underneath it, which supported
a large sea-shell. The whole thing reminded her
of a similar arrangement at her dressmaker's in
town, and seemed in some way the crowning feature
of the prosaic, painfully respectable character
of the room. She hated to look at herself there&mdash;the
glass brought out all one's defects. But to-day,
in spite of the trying glare of the sunshine, her own
image flashed back at her, so brilliantly fresh, in
her white dimity gown, so redolent of health and
beauty, that she could not help smiling back at it,
as at some delightful apparition. Ah, yes, it was
good to be young and pretty, and to have a lover
waiting for one near by. Her eyes brightened unconsciously,
and she gave a little caressing touch to
45
the shining masses of wavy hair which stood out,
like red molten gold, against the broad brim of her
shady white hat.

The other girl sat and watched her.

"You like to look at yourself, don't you?" The
words rang out harshly, suddenly. Elizabeth
started and turned around. It seemed to her for a
moment as if some third person had spoken&mdash;some
one with a strange, mocking voice that she had
never heard before. But there was no one else in
the room.

"Yes, you like to look at yourself." Amanda
went on after a pause, more quietly, "you think
yourself a beauty, and a good many people, perhaps,
might agree with you. He tells you so, I
suppose. I daresay he tells you your hair's picturesque&mdash;he
used to tell me that about mine. He was
going to paint my picture, but it went out of his
head when he saw you. Most things did, I guess.
He&mdash;he hasn't been here since." The girl's voice
broke in a quick, convulsive sob, and she stopped
for a moment, but went on almost immediately:
"If you hadn't come in that day, it would have been
all right. We were keeping company; every one in
The Mills knew we were. All the girls were jealous
of me&mdash;as if he'd have looked at them! Some of
them work in the factory, there's many of them
don't even have a piano and sit in their kitchens. I
know what's genteel, even if I can't talk all that
rubbish about music and Wagner that you learned
at school. And what good will all that do you when
you're married? What do you know about mending
46
and sewing and cooking? What sort of a wife
would you make him? You'd ruin him in a month
with your fine clothes. But men are such fools!"
She gave a short mirthless laugh, her eyes glittered
strangely. Elizabeth stared at her paralyzed, glued
to the spot in helpless fascination. She had never
heard Amanda talk so much before. Her words
came quickly, fiercely, one upon another, like some
overwhelming torrent that had been suddenly let
loose.

"Why should you have so much more than me?
Why should you have fine clothes, and a carriage,
and go to school in New York, and have the swells
in the neighborhood call on you? Was your mother
any better than mine, or a hundredth part as good?
She wasn't even respectable; no decent people at
The Mills would speak to her before your father
married her&mdash;I know that for a fact. And then to
give yourself airs!" Amanda stopped short, panting,
exhausted by her own vehemence. Elizabeth
still stood before her powerless. When Amanda
spoke of her mother the color rushed into her white
face, and she made an effort to speak; but the words
seemed to die away on her lips. Amanda, after a
moment's pause, went on.

"It isn't that I care so much about that; you
might have had everything else, if you hadn't taken&mdash;him.
Why did you come in that day looking like
a dressed-up doll? You hadn't been here for
weeks, and I was glad. I didn't want him to know
you&mdash;I wasn't afraid of the other girls. But you
who've got so much&mdash;couldn't you have had the decency
47
to leave him alone? Couldn't you see that he
was mine?"

"Amanda," Elizabeth gasped out. "I&mdash;I didn't
know. I&mdash;I never thought"&mdash;Her brain reeled,
she stammered painfully, trying in vain for words
to vindicate herself from this shameful charge.
Amanda brushed her aside contemptuously.

"You didn't think?&mdash;no, you never do, of anything
but yourself, your pretty face and pretty
clothes! You're selfish and spoiled&mdash;every one
knows it; you've had every wish granted till you
want everything, and you won't be satisfied with
less. But what's the good of saying all this to
you?" she broke off suddenly, with a sharp change
of tone. "I must be crazy; I've felt so, I'm sure,
these last weeks. It won't make any difference&mdash;nothing
I say can bring him back. And yet he'd
have married me&mdash;if you hadn't come." She went
to Elizabeth and gripped her by the wrist. "He
kissed me once," she said. "Has he kissed you
yet?"

"No," said Elizabeth, mechanically, "no." She
shrank away a little and set her teeth. Amanda's
grasp was painful, but she would not have cried out
for worlds.

"Well, when he does," Amanda said, "remember
this&mdash;he kissed me first. You can't take that away
from me&mdash;I have the first claim." She let go of
Elizabeth's hands and fell back a step. There were
two deep red marks from her grasp. "Now go,"
she said, "go to him. I knew you were going to
him&mdash;I saw you thinking of it, and it made me hate
48
you. Go to him and tell him that I hope his love
for you will last as long as it did for me." She
laughed again harshly and then suddenly burst into
violent weeping. "Oh, it's ignominious," she said,
"it's contemptible. No one can despise me more than
I do myself. I haven't any pride. I hate him&mdash;I
hate him; yet I'd take him back now, if he'd come
to me." She sank down on the sofa and hid her
face in the red plush cushions, while her whole
frame shook with convulsive sobs.

Elizabeth stood still in the middle of the floor.
Mechanically she glanced at her reflection in the
mirror; white, distraught, with startled eyes&mdash;a
ghastly parody of the brilliant vision which had
smiled back at her only a few minutes before. The
hot sunlight, flooding the commonplace little room,
seemed to bring out, with glaring vividness, all the
tragic, sordid elements of the scene. A quarrel
between two women about a lover! Could anything
be more hopelessly vulgar and grotesque?

It was the sting of this thought that finally roused
Elizabeth to speech. She raised her head with sudden
haughtiness, and her words came clearly and
fluently. "I don't know what you mean, Amanda,"
she said "by this scene. If there is any one whom
you&mdash;you think I have taken from you, you can have
him back to-morrow so far as I am concerned. I
don't want any other woman's lover. It&mdash;it would
be base. Whatever else you think me, I'm not&mdash;that.
If it is Paul Halleck whom you mean, you can
marry him, if you wish, to-morrow. At least you
may be sure of one thing, that I never will." Her
49
low, vehement voice died away, and she waited for
an answer; but none came. Amanda only sobbed
on hysterically, her face buried in the sofa-cushions.

Elizabeth stood looking at her for a moment, with
a feeling in which pity, anger and repulsion were
strangely mingled; then she hastily left the room
by the door that led directly to the street. She
had presence of mind enough to avoid the shop and
her aunt's unfriendly eyes. She reached the carriage,
and&mdash;un-heard-of thing&mdash;touched the white
pony with the whip.

Chapter VII


They had left the last house behind; they
were out in the open country. Elizabeth
dropped the reins and let her
tears flow unchecked&mdash;hot, blinding tears, the
bitterest she had ever shed. At each familiar
tree and landmark she sobbed with redoubled
violence. Only an hour before she had driven along
this same road in the ecstatic glow of her first romance.
Now all the bloom had been rubbed from
that romance, all the glory faded from the hero of
her dreams; she herself was a woman who had
been insulted, humiliated, dragged in the dust.

By degrees a few coherent phrases detached themselves
from the confused mass of painful recollections,
and stung more sharply than the rest. "My
mother better than yours&mdash;she wasn't even respectable;
no decent people would speak to her" ...
Oh, it was too bad&mdash;too bad; she had not thought
it was so bad as that. Amanda must have exaggerated&mdash;she
would ask her aunts; but no, no she would
never speak of that interview to a soul. It was humiliating
enough as it was.... "He kissed me
once. Has he kissed you yet?" No, thank Heaven!
that indignity had been spared her. They had hovered
as yet on the borderland of love; she had put off
51
the inevitable declaration with instinctive coquetry,
a vague unwillingness to be won too easily. She
was glad now&mdash;glad and thankful; he did not know
that she cared,&mdash;he should never know. She had
no love for the man who had kissed Amanda....
"Selfish and spoiled&mdash;thinking only of herself?"
Yes, she might be all that; but at least she would
not take another woman's lover. The words "it
would be base," rang in her ears. Had she spoken
them, or Amanda? At all events, they were true.
It would be base to marry Halleck now. In fact,
she did not wish to marry him. It was he who had
involved her in this horrible, sordid misery. Her
aunts were right; there must be distinctions of
classes. Had her father remembered this, people
would not have it in their power to insult his
daughter now.

Through all her complex feelings ran a sharp
sense of anger against Amanda, mingled strangely
with an involuntary pity, almost with an understanding
of her point of view. It was not based on
justice, but on fellow feeling. Amanda had resented
her superiority; she, Elizabeth, knew what
that was. She had felt the same herself, when smarting
impotently under the patronizing friendliness of
the other girls in the Neighborhood, and then had
turned, with unconscious snobbery, to play the same
part towards Amanda. The incongruous, grotesque
humor of the situation struck her suddenly, and she
laughed out loud in bitter irony. She had envied
the other girls of the Neighborhood, Amanda had
envied her, the girls at Bassett Mills had envied
52
Amanda. Strange net-work of classes in a democratic
country, of distinctions the more galling for
their intangibility. Of one thing Elizabeth was convinced,
that she could never herself "put on airs"
as Amanda had said, again; there was not a girl in
the whole countryside, blessed with a good mother,
who could not look down on her, if she pleased.

Her tears were falling now so fast and blinding
that she could not see the road; she was not even
conscious that they had reached the spot where the
white pony stopped now of his own accord. And
even as he did so, a young man stepped forward
and grasped the reins which had fallen from Elizabeth's
nerveless hand; a tall, fair young man who
had been standing for the last half hour, scanning
anxiously, with his bright blue eyes, the glaring
dusty road.

"Elizabeth," said Halleck (he had called her that
for five happy days) "Elizabeth, why are you so
late? And, for Heaven's sake, what's the matter?"

Elizabeth looked up and with great effort, stopped
crying; but otherwise she made no sign of pleasure
in his presence or even of recognition. She put up
one hand, indeed, and straightened her hat, but this
was a purely mechanical concession to the force of
habit. She knew that her face was flushed and
tear-stained, her eyes red and swollen; she was sure
that she looked an absolute fright, and she did not
care. She was past caring, at least for the moment.

"Elizabeth," Halleck repeated, more and more
bewildered, "what is the matter? I've been waiting
for you an hour. You've been crying," he added,
53
stating unnecessarily an obvious fact. "Won't you
tell me what it is?"

"Nothing&mdash;nothing," Elizabeth answered at last,
in a voice that was still thick and choked with sobs.
"I haven't been crying or," struck by the futility of
denial, she added hastily "if I have it&mdash;it's no
matter. Will you please let me pass?" She tried
to take the reins from his hands, but he grasped
them firmly, and laid the other hand on the bar of
the wagon.

"Won't you let me pass?" she repeated stubbornly.

"Not till you tell me what's the matter."

He eyed her coolly, determinedly, all the habit of
power depicted on the lines of his handsome face.
She stared back at him defiantly, with her tear-swollen
eyes. Her whole attitude breathed the
spirit of rebellion; a spirit new in their intercourse.
Halleck saw it, at the same time that he noted
the disfiguring marks of tears on her face. Oddly
enough, he had never admired her so much.

Nevertheless, he was determined to remain master
of the situation. He glanced up and down the road;
there were never many people passing, but it was
not safe to rely on this fact.

"We can't talk here," he said. "Come into the
field."

"I don't wish to," she said, stubbornly. "I'm
going home."

He fixed his eyes upon her. "You shall not go
home," he said quietly, "till you have told me all
about it." She sat immovable, her pouting under
54
lip thrust out in a way that she had sometimes, in
moments of obstinacy and displeasure. She did not
meet his eyes. "Don't be childish," Paul said, pleasantly,
after a moment. "You know you must tell
me what it is."

She looked up reluctantly, and met his steady
gaze, under which she turned first white, then red,
and slowly, as if fascinated, rose from her seat. Yet
still her words were unyielding. "We may as well
have it out at once," she said, coldly.

Halleck could not repress a thrill of triumph. It
was sweet to test his power over this beautiful, high-spirited
girl, to feel her will, her intellect, like wax
in his hands. But he tried not to show this consciousness
in his face. She was in a strange mood;
he did not understand her. Gravely and respectfully
he helped her to scale the stone wall, which separated
the meadow from the road. Her hand barely rested
on his, and her eyes were averted carefully, but he
paid no heed. He fastened the white pony to a tree,
then slowly and thoughtfully followed Elizabeth
across the field.

The noon-day sun beat down upon them in all its
scorching brilliancy; it was pleasant to gain the
shade of their usual trysting-place. Here the little
brook, which had rippled and sparkled over stones
and moss all the way from the mill-stream, formed
itself into a quiet pool, over which weeping willows
spread out long branches, and seemed to admire their
own reflection in the cool green mirror beneath.
Elizabeth took her usual seat on a fallen moss-covered
log, drawing, as she did so, her white skirts
55
about her, with what seemed an involuntary gesture
of repulsion, and Halleck, who was about to place
himself beside her, flushed and bit his lip. After
a moment's hesitation, he threw himself down sullenly
on the grass a little way off.

"Tell me," he said, in a tone that was the more
determined for this little episode "tell me now what
the matter is."

Elizabeth's eyes were fixed upon the cool, green
water at her feet. "I don't know why you think,"
she said, slowly "that it has anything to do with
you."

"Not when you are a full hour late for our appointment?
Not when you treat me like an outcast?
Oh, Elizabeth,"&mdash;the young man's voice softened
suddenly, skillfully&mdash;"how can you trifle with me
so, when I love you?"

He caught, or thought he did, a quiver in her
face, although her eyes were still resolutely bent
upon the pool. "Yes, I love you," he repeated.
"I've loved you, I believe, ever since the day you
came into that horrid, stuffy little room, looking like
an angel&mdash;with that hair and that skin&mdash;so different
from Amanda."&mdash;

He stopped as an indignant wave of color flamed
in Elizabeth's cheeks. "How can you speak of
Amanda&mdash;like that?" she broke out passionately,
"when you loved her too, or told her so at least,
when you said the same things no doubt to her
that you are saying now to me?"

A light broke in upon Paul. In his relief he
laughed out loud. "Amanda," he said. "Amanda!
56
So she has been talking to you? And you believed
all the nonsense she told you? And that is why you
acted so strangely. I thought it was something serious!"
And he laughed again in sheer light-heartedness.
So all this had been only jealous pique,
after all.

The gloom on Elizabeth's face did not lighten.
"You seem to find the idea amusing," she said,
coldly. "I do not."

"Because you don't understand how absurd it is.
I never made love to Amanda&mdash;if she made love to
me"&mdash;Paul stopped, warned by a curious stiffening
in Elizabeth's attitude that he was on dangerous
ground. She was not like other girls whom he had
known&mdash;he had noticed this before; she required
special treatment. "My dear child," he said, in a
calm, argumentative tone "really you are a little
hard on me. A man can't measure every word he
says to a girl. I may have paid Amanda a few compliments,
flirted with her a little, if you insist upon
it, but&mdash;that's not a crime, is it? And I never gave
her a thought, I hardly remembered her existence,
after I had once&mdash;seen you." There was unmistakable
sincerity in his voice. "Look at me, Elizabeth,"
he went on anxiously, "look at me, and tell
me that you believe me."

Elizabeth raised her troubled eyes to his. "I&mdash;I
don't know," she said, slowly. She did believe
him&mdash;to some extent, at least. But what he told her
did not alter the fact that it was she who had taken
him away from Amanda, that, but for her, he might
57
have been her cousin's admirer still. And that, after
all, had been the substance of Amanda's accusation.

"Tell me the truth," she said, suddenly "if I
had not come in that day&mdash;if you had never seen
me, would you&mdash;would you have married Amanda?"
She fixed her eager eyes upon his face, and waited
breathless for his answer. He gave it with a light
laugh.

"Marry Amanda!" he declared, "well, hardly!
Such an idea never entered my head."

"Then," said Elizabeth, slowly "you deceived
her."

He shrugged his shoulders. "She deceived herself,
I think," he said. "It's not my fault if she&mdash;imagined
things. Why should I marry a girl
like that? She's not pretty, she's stupid, ignorant.
Bah, don't talk to me of Amanda." He disposed of
the matter with a wave of the hand and another light
laugh. Elizabeth felt a sudden conviction of the
absurdity of her own behavior. The painful, scorching
flush in her cheeks was beginning to cool; the
burning, angry shame in her heart was dying away.
The remembrance of Amanda's words grew fainter;
Paul's handsome face, his air of triumphant health
and life, were again in the ascendent.

He saw the yielding in her eyes and brought out
his most effective argument. He took boldly the
seat beside her on the log and though she shrank
away, it was not, he thought, entirely with aversion.
"My darling," he said, "don't let trifles come between
us. I love you, you love me; isn't that
58
enough? Elizabeth, you are the most beautiful
woman in the world. Elizabeth, dearest" ...
He put out his arm and drew her towards him. She
still shrank away, fascinated yet trembling, frightened
at this new delight, this thrill of pleasure in his
touch.

"Don't," she gasped out, "Amanda"&mdash;He
stopped her protest with a kiss.

And it was not till later, when she reached home,
that she thought again of Amanda's words: "Remember,
he kissed me first."

Chapter VIII


Miss Cornelia and Miss Joanna sat
at the breakfast-table and looked
aghast at Elizabeth, who had just informed
them of her engagement. The old Dutch
clock on the mantel-piece ticked loudly, the sunlight
fell in shining bars upon the snowy table-cloth, the
old Dutch china, the glistening silver. Miss Cornelia
was reminded forcibly, painfully, of a morning in
that same room many years ago, when Peter had announced
his marriage. Now the shock was not so
great, was not unexpected, perhaps; but it brought
with it, if less horror, an even greater disappointment.

"Well," Elizabeth said, after a moment, when her
important announcement had produced no response,
and she looked proudly, yet half wistfully, from one
to the other. "Well," she repeated, "have you
nothing to say? Can't you&mdash;congratulate me?"
Her voice faltered over the last words.

"My dear," Miss Cornelia tried bravely to respond
to the appeal in the girl's tone. "Of course, we&mdash;we
wish you every happiness," she stammered out.
She stopped, for tears choked her voice. She looked
despairingly at her sister. Was this the moment
that they had so often talked of together, planning
60
with delicious thrills of pleasure all they would say
and do? "This china must be Elizabeth's when&mdash;when
she marries, you know." "We must lay by a
little for&mdash;for Elizabeth's trousseau." This in demure
whispers to each other, for they would not for
the world have suggested such a possibility to the
girl herself. Nice girls, of course, must not think
of getting married till the time came, but&mdash;with
Elizabeth's beauty, that time could not be long delayed,
not even in the Neighborhood. The fairy
prince would appear some day; though he had never
come to them, they believed devoutly that he would
come to Elizabeth. And now&mdash;and now&mdash;the fairy
prince had come, or Elizabeth thought so; but they
were only conscious of an overwhelming sense of
doubt.

"You know so little about him, my dear," Miss
Cornelia could not help at last protesting.

Elizabeth opened her eyes wide in genuine surprise.
"So little of him," she repeated. "Why, I&mdash;I
know everything, Aunt Cornelia." And she
smiled to herself in silent amusement. Had she
not seen him, every day and twice a day, for a matter
of four weeks. How long did they think, these
older women, that it took to know a man? "I
know that he loves me," she said, after a moment,
descending to further particulars "and I love him,
and that's enough."

"But you can't live on love," urged Miss Joanna,
practically. "You must have some money, you
know, and I shouldn't think he, poor young man,
had anything&mdash;at least, judging by his clothes.
61
Those artists never have, they say. And meat, and
everything indeed, never was so dear as it is now."

"I didn't know you were so worldly, Aunt Joanna,"
said Elizabeth, loftily. "Do you want me
to marry for money?" Miss Joanna was crushed.
But as she reflected in her own justification, one
had to have something to eat, let lovers say what
they would.

"My dear," said Miss Cornelia, coming to the
rescue with the little air of dignity that she could
sometimes assume "we certainly wouldn't want you&mdash;not
for the world&mdash;to marry for money. But one
has to be&mdash;to be prudent. We have brought you
up in a way&mdash;perhaps it was unwise&mdash;poor Mother
would have thought so. But at any rate you know
nothing about economy, and&mdash;and you have only a
little money, my dear, and he, I suppose, has nothing."

"He&mdash;he expects to make a great deal of money
soon," faltered Elizabeth, coming down a little from
her heights of romance. All this prudence was like
a dash of cold water in the face. She felt disconcerted,
indignant, and yet conscious, through it all
of some reason in her aunts' objections. Yes, it
was true&mdash;she had not been brought up to economy,
she was fond of luxury and pretty things. In all
her wishes for change, she had never thought that
it would be amusing to miss any of these.

Miss Cornelia saw that she had produced some
effect. "I think," she went on, still speaking with
unusual decision, "that the most important thing
is to find out something about him. You can't marry
62
a man whom we know nothing about, except that&mdash;that
he was born at The Mills. We must investigate
his character." Miss Cornelia felt, as she
brought out this last sentence, that it sounded
eminently practical, and it received from Miss Joanna,
indeed, its full meed of respectful admiration.
Elizabeth only smiled superior.

"You can investigate as much as you like, Aunt
Cornelia," she said. "I know all about him." And
so the matter rested.

But how could two elderly and innocent spinsters,
who had never in their lives stirred two hundred
miles from home, investigate the character of a
young man who had lived in Chicago and Paris and
Vienna and all the four quarters of the world apparently?
They had no idea how to set about it.
In this perplexity Miss Cornelia again rose to the
occasion, and suggested that the Rector might be a
fit substitute for that invaluable possession "a man
in the family," who is always supposed to accomplish
so much. And the Rector, when consulted,
proved unexpectedly resourceful. He had made
Paul's acquaintance, and learned the name of the
church in Chicago where he had sung for so many
years. He had discovered, too, that the Rector of
this church was an old college friend of his, and
he wrote to him at once, requesting full and confidential
information as to the young man's character,
antecedents, and prospects.

The answer seemed to the poor ladies a long time
in coming; as a matter of fact, it arrived very
promptly. The Rector of St. Anne's at Chicago
63
regretted to inform his old friend and colleague the
Rector of St. Mary's, at Bassett Mills, that he had
no good account to give of Paul Halleck, who had
not long ago been dismissed from the choir of his
church, and had left behind him in Chicago many
debts and a bad reputation. The young man was
believed to have, as the Rector added, genuine musical
talent; but like many artists and musicians,
he was morally irresponsible, dissipated and reckless.

The Rector of St. Mary's repeated the verdict,
as gently as he could, to the older ladies at the
Homestead. They bore it better than he expected.
There were compensations indeed in the very extent
of its severity. Had Halleck been less evidently and
irredeemably a black sheep, there might have been
some doubts as to their own duty; but, as it was,
they felt that they must break off the dreadful
match at once, and at any cost.

Yet the heart of each sister misgave her as they
sat in a solemn conclave, and summoned Elizabeth
before it. She came, rosy, bright-eyed, fresh from
talks with her lover and happy dreams of a brilliant
future, which they were to share together. She
stood listening in apparent indifference, while Miss
Cornelia faltered out the painful result of their inquiries.
And when the worst was told, she had
turned perhaps a trifle pale, but otherwise she
seemed unmoved.

"I don't know why you tell me all this, auntie,"
she said, slowly. "I&mdash;I am sorry to hear it, but it
can make no difference."
64

"No difference!" Miss Cornelia repeated, stupefied.
"No difference, Elizabeth?"

"No, it can't change my love for him," she said,
defiantly. "He told me that he has enemies at
Chicago, and that you would probably unearth a lot
of old scandals; and I promised that it should make
no difference. Perhaps some of them are true; I
don't care. Auntie, I can't&mdash;I can't give him up,"
she went on with a sudden change of tone and clasping
her hands appealingly. "I tried to once before,
and&mdash;I couldn't. If he were to go away now and
leave me, I&mdash;I should die. I couldn't bear to go on
living without him." The girl's face was flushed,
her voice tremulous with feeling; it was evident
that she fully meant&mdash;or thought that she meant&mdash;what
she said. Her aunts looked at her in helpless
perplexity.

"My darling," Miss Cornelia faltered at last,
"think how much better it is to give him up now
than to&mdash;to marry him and be unhappy. You don't
know&mdash;men are very bad;&mdash;one reads such things
in the newspapers. If he were to ill-treat you, desert
you."

"Ah, but he won't," said Elizabeth, smiling incredulously.
"You needn't worry, Aunt Cornelia;
we shall be very happy. But even if we were not,"
she concluded, with a sudden burst of defiance. "If
I thought that he would beat me, treat me like a
dog&mdash;I don't care; I should marry him to-morrow."

And she thrust out her full under lip, and stood
facing them, with a look of obstinacy on her fair,
65
girlish face, that for the moment bore a strong resemblance
to her father.

To Miss Cornelia's mind there rose again, with
startling vividness, the events of twenty years before.
The recollection seemed to endow her with an unwonted
and unnatural strength. She went over to
where Elizabeth stood and took both the girl's hot
hands in hers.

"Elizabeth," she said, desperately, "you don't
know what you're saying. You will be miserable if
you marry that man. You don't know what it is to
live with a person who is beneath you, who&mdash;who
drags you down. We know, my darling, we have
seen it. Be warned by us, and give him up."

Miss Cornelia had never in all her gentle life
spoken with so much vehemence. Elizabeth, in her
astonishment, stood for a moment absolutely passive.
She stole a glance at Miss Joanna; she was
weeping quietly. Elizabeth's own face worked, her
lip quivered. "I know whom you mean," she broke
out, suddenly, in a quick hard voice. "You're thinking
of my mother." And then, in the dismayed
pause that followed, she dragged her hands away
from Miss Cornelia's grasp and fled from the room.

The two older women looked at one another in
silence.

"I didn't know," Miss Joanna said at last in a
low, awe-struck tone "that the child knew anything
about&mdash;about poor Malvina."

Chapter IX


"And so you let all this nonsense influence
you?" Halleck asked this bitterly,
staring up with moody eyes
into Elizabeth's face. They were sitting under
a wide-spreading tree, in a field not far from the
Homestead. It was late afternoon and the shadows
were long and peaceful. A ray from the sinking
sun shot through the foliage overhead lighting up
the red tints of Elizabeth's hair. Halleck's artistic
eye rested upon them fascinated. He had never,
as he told himself, been so much in love before.

"You give me up because of a little opposition?"
he went on bitterly, roused to increased irritation
by the thought of losing her.

"Why, what can I do?" The girl's voice
was weary, and she threw out her hands with a
helpless gesture. "They will give in to me, I suppose,
if I insist; but it makes them too unhappy. I
believe it would kill them. If they were unkind,
I shouldn't care; but they only cry, and are so
wretched, and I can't stand it. It makes me feel so
ungrateful."

"And yet," said Halleck, anxiously, "you think
they will give in in the end?"

"Oh, yes, they'll give in," said Elizabeth,
67
wearily. "They'll give in, if I insist; and that's
the very reason why I&mdash;what makes it so hard, you
see."

"No, I don't see," said Paul, bluntly. "If you
think they will give in, why are you so unhappy?
But I understand how it is" he went on, harshly,
"you don't love me. I'm too far beneath you&mdash;a
Bohemian and an outcast. You are glad of an excuse
to throw me over."

"Paul!" The indignant color flushed into Elizabeth's
face. "How can you say such things," she
asked reproachfully. "You know they are not true.
I told my aunts that I would never give you up; I
told them that&mdash;that I would marry you to-morrow,
if I could."

"You told them that?" Paul exclaimed exultantly.
He put his arm around her and drew her
towards him. "Then keep your word, darling," he
said. "Marry me to-morrow."

Elizabeth shrank away, startled. "Marry you,"
she repeated. "To-morrow, how could I?"

"Why not," said Paul, quietly. "Come up to
Cranston and we will be married. Then let them
say what they please."

Elizabeth was very pale. "I couldn't do that,"
she said in a low voice. "I don't want to be married
so soon; and besides&mdash;it would kill my aunts."

He laughed. "Nonsense! People soon resign
themselves to what they can't help. And then they
needn't know&mdash;yet awhile. Listen, darling, this is
my plan. You know that I want to go abroad&mdash;well,
I have had a letter offering me a position in an
68
opera company in Munich. If I accept it I start
this week."

He stopped as Elizabeth gave a little cry and
stared up at him with reproachful eyes. "This
week," she said. "You go away this week?"

"Why, I can't stay here forever, you know," Paul
said. "I've idled away my time unconscionably
already&mdash;but that is your fault, Elizabeth. Now it
is time I went to work. And that is why I say&mdash;marry
me before I go. Then, while I am away,
nothing can separate us."

Elizabeth, pale and thoughtful, seemed to ponder
the suggestion. "Marry you," she repeated, slowly.
"Marry you&mdash;now at once?"

"Yes, to-morrow," said Paul, boldly.

"And&mdash;and keep it secret?" she went on, with
a troubled look.

"Yes, for a little while," said Paul, "for a few
months, till I come back. I shall have made my
name and my fortune, darling, I hope, by that time,
and your aunts will be quite reconciled to me."

"Then wouldn't it be better," said Elizabeth, with
much reason, "to wait till then?"

"Are you willing to wait&mdash;in uncertainty all this
time?" he asked, reproachfully. "Ah, Elizabeth,
it is evident that you don't love me as I love you.
Such an absence would be unbearable to me, if I
felt that some lover was likely to come along at
any time and take you from me."

Elizabeth could not help reflecting that the danger
of such a catastrophe did not seem imminent, in the
present condition of the Neighborhood; but she did
69
not put the thought into words. She only said, with
some dignity: "I don't think that I am the sort of
girl to change so easily."

"Ah, you can't tell," said Paul. "Women are
fickle beings. I don't trust you, Elizabeth. I have
a feeling that, if you don't marry me now, you
never will. And why should you hesitate?" he went
on eagerly. "It isn't so much that I ask. I don't
even say&mdash;come abroad with me now; only give me
the certainty that when I come back, I shall be able
to claim you."

"You would have that certainty now," she still
insisted. "I promise that I will marry you when
you come back."

"Then why not marry me now," he asked, triumphantly.

Elizabeth could give no good reason to the contrary.
The idea was vaguely alarming, yet it held
for her a certain fascination. She sat listening in
troubled uncertainty, while Paul discoursed with
enthusiasm over the many advantages of his plan.
He was exceedingly anxious, as he had said, to make
sure of this beautiful girl, who was, he vaguely felt,
a little above him&mdash;of a grade superior to that of the
other girls whom he had known and made love to,
for the space of a fortnight perhaps. He had been
true to Elizabeth, now, for more than double that
time. He really believed that he should be true to
her always. There were other things that attracted
him besides her beauty. The thought that Elizabeth
was Miss Van Vorst of the Homestead was not
unpleasant to him; the old house, the family silver,
70
the family traditions, appealed to his artistic sense
of fitness. And then though he was no fortune-hunter,
and certainly would have made love to no
girl whom he did not for the moment at least sincerely
admire, he admitted to himself, frankly, that
it was by no means inconvenient that Elizabeth
should have a little money of her own and the prospect
of more in the future. The Van Vorst property,
while it was insignificant enough when measured
by the standard of the Van Antwerps and other
rich people in the Neighborhood, seemed by no means
contemptible to Paul, who measured it by the standard
of poverty-stricken Bohemia.

Elizabeth's feelings were more complex, less
frankly selfish, much more anxious and uncertain.
The money question did not enter into them to any
great extent, though she had an instinctive dread of
poverty, and she was convinced that, if once married
to Paul, she would not be able to have the
pretty gowns, and other luxurious trifles, which had
hitherto seemed a necessity of life. But she was
young and romantic, and this thought did not weigh
with her very much. What most distressed her,
and made her feel in some way vaguely in the wrong,
was the trouble this, her first love affair, seemed
to bring to others; to her aunts, to Amanda. She
loved her aunts, and hated to run counter to their
wishes; she did not love Amanda, and yet the
thought of having injured her, though unconsciously,
brought with it an uncomfortable sense of guilt.

She had not seen her since that terrible interview,
which she still could not recall without a feeling
71
of humiliation; but she had seen her aunt, who told
her that Amanda was ill with some low fever&mdash;typhoid
malaria, probably; there was always a good
deal of that at The Mills. It was not considered
wise that Elizabeth should see her; and besides,
Amanda was delirious, and did not recognize any
one. Elizabeth was more relieved than sorry to hear
it. No doubt, she told herself, Amanda was already
out of her head when she uttered that extraordinary
outburst, and it was foolish to attach any importance
to what she said in her feverish excitement. Still,
Elizabeth did not like to think of it, much less of
the promise she herself had given, voluntarily, in
such forcible words. She had been so absolutely sincere
in making it; she had broken it so completely
within the hour. The whole affair was unpleasant,
and weighed upon her more than those more serious
charges against Paul, which had fallen vaguely
upon her ear, not seeming to make any deep impression.
His conduct to Amanda was at its worst
a mere trifle in comparison.

Still she could not give him up. That broken
promise to Amanda only proved this the more
strongly. She could not face the prospect of life
without him. And yet she could not face without
terrible misgivings the prospect of further tears and
remonstrances from her aunts. The two claims
struggled for the mastery; on the one hand, the
claims of the women who had brought her up, whose
every thought for twenty years had centred in her;
on the other, the claims of the man who had loved
her in his light way some five weeks. Under these
72
circumstances, it was inevitable that the claims of
the man should predominate. And yet Elizabeth
longed to satisfy them both.

Paul's plan seemed to suggest a compromise. And
Elizabeth had not yet learned that compromise is
never satisfactory to either side.

"Listen," she said, looking at him intently, with
eyes that seemed to hold, even in the moment of
yielding, a certain defiance of his power, "If I do
as you wish, if I&mdash;I marry you to-morrow, I am
free to&mdash;to come home at once, to go on with my
life as if nothing were changed&mdash;not to tell my aunts,
not to tell any one, till you come back? Do you
promise this, on your word of honor?"

For a moment Paul hesitated. He had hardly expected
her to yield so easily; perhaps if he pressed
the matter she might be persuaded even to go abroad
with him at once. But there were financial reasons
which made that inexpedient just then. On the
whole, Paul decided not to test his power too far.

"Upon my word of honor," he said, looking her
steadily in the face "I promise that you shall be
free as air, to go on with your life as you please,
till I come back to claim you."

And so the thing was settled. Paul was to go to
Cranston early the next morning to make all necessary
arrangements; Elizabeth was to follow him a
little later. They were to be married at once. Then
Paul was to take an afternoon train for New York,
Elizabeth was to return home, the whole affair
should remain a secret.
73

Then Paul, radiantly triumphant, clasped Elizabeth
in his arms, and pressed his lips to hers.

"To-morrow," he whispered, "to-morrow, my
darling, at this time&mdash;though the world won't know
it&mdash;still you will be my wife."

A strange feeling thrilled Elizabeth. She could
not have told if it were pleasure, or some involuntary
presentiment. But aloud she repeated mechanically:
"Yes, I shall be your wife."

"You won't fail me, dearest," he said, scanning
her face eagerly. "You won't break your word?
You have promised&mdash;you won't fail me?"

"No," Elizabeth answered, "I have promised&mdash;I
won't fail you."

And yet the thought crossed her mind irrelevantly,
that she had broken a promise once already.

She left him and went home through the stillness
and the fast gathering shadows of the evening.
The days were already growing shorter. She
noted the fact mechanically; noted too that the deep
glowing crimson of the sunset foretold a hot day
for the morrow. She entered the house and looked
in at the dining-room; the table was set out for tea
with all the wonted care. Her aunts sat each at
one end; they were neither of them eating and both
had red eyes. In the centre of the table stood Elizabeth's
favorite cake&mdash;the kind with the raisins in it,
which she used to beg for as a child, and which
was reserved either as a reward for virtue, or for
consolation in some childish trouble. Now in this
trouble that was so far from childish, poor Miss Joanna
74
had bethought herself of the old attention, and
brought out the favorite cake as the only means of
comfort within her power. Elizabeth could not see
it without a lump in her throat.

She smoothed her ruffled hair before the glass and
came in quietly to her usual place at the table. They
looked up nervously at her entrance, but neither
spoke; they did not reproach her with being late or
ask where she had been. Miss Joanna pressed upon
her the various dainties, reminding her that she had
eaten no dinner; otherwise the meal was a silent
one. It was not till near the end of it that Elizabeth
spoke in a strained harsh voice unlike her own.

"Paul is going away." That was what she said.
"He&mdash;has an engagement to go abroad. He goes
to New York to-morrow. I&mdash;I hope you are satisfied."

And then she stopped, for the look of tremulous
relief on both their faces was almost more than she
could bear. The raisins in her favorite cake seemed
suddenly to choke her. She began to doubt, after
all, whether she would go to Cranston the next day.


75

Chapter X


This was Elizabeth's last thought that night;
it was her first in the morning. She
dressed herself carefully, putting on white,
according to the custom which had aroused Aunt
Rebecca's criticism; and all the while she asked of
the reflection that stared back at her with perplexed
eyes out of the mirror: "Shall I go, or shall
I not?" She put the question to a rose when she
got down-stairs, repeating as she ruthlessly destroyed
each petal. "Yes, no, yes, no?" But the
flower answered with a "no," and she threw away
the last petal in disgust.

"I think I shall drive over to The Mills this morning,"
she announced quietly at the breakfast-table.
"There is some ribbon I want to match." Her
aunts looked up startled. They wondered simultaneously
at what hour Halleck was to leave for
New York. Yet what if after all the child wished
for one last meeting?

"You don't think it's&mdash;it's too hot to go over
there to-day, my dear?" Miss Cornelia ventured at
last uncertainly.

"No, I don't mind the heat," Elizabeth answered
indifferently, as she sat playing with her knife and
fork. She was very pale and had no appetite. This
76
seemed to them only natural. They hoped that when
the young man were once out of the way, their darling
would be herself again.

"We must take her to the sea-shore for a little
while," Miss Cornelia observed when Elizabeth had
left the room. "She needs change of air." Miss
Joanna cheerfully assented. The idea and the sacrifice
which it involved (since to go away from home,
even for a few weeks, seemed a terrible undertaking)
consoled them both greatly.

And meanwhile Elizabeth went her own way. It
was not till she was seated in the carriage about to
start on her drive, that she observed as if by an
afterthought: "Oh, by the way, if I can't match
the ribbon at The Mills, I may go to Cranston for
it by the trolley, so don't be worried if I don't come
back till late, and don't wait dinner." Her aunts
looked at one another questioningly; but she drove
off at once, before they could offer any objections.

And so Elizabeth drove towards Bassett Mills.
The day was dry and hot, as were most days that
summer. The sun beat down out of a brazen sky,
the roads were white with dust, the grass in the
fields was sere and brown. The locusts all along
the way kept up a loud, exultant song, the burden of
which was heat.

To Elizabeth, as she drove on, there began to be
something ominous in it all; in the heat and the dust
and the dazzling sunshine and the locusts with their
eternal noise. They seemed all part, and she with
them of some horrible nightmare; she was under
some spell which benumbed her, deprived her of the
77
capacity for thought, of all but the power to keep
doggedly on the way to Bassett Mills. What she
should do when she got there she did not know;
her brain was torpid, there was a strange ringing
in her ears. It was the sun, no doubt, that was
affecting her head; it would be wise to turn back, or
she might be ill. But still she kept on.

It was not far from noon when she reached Bassett
Mills. There was little life about the place
this hot morning; the mill-stream even seemed to
dash less tumultuously, and showed signs of running
dry. A group of men stood outside the drug-store,
which was a great meeting-place, and discussed
the drought. It was decided that if it continued
the crops would be ruined; but hopes were
founded on the fact that prayers for rain were to
be offered in all the churches on Sunday.

"But there's not much use praying for rain," said
one skeptic, "when the wind's due west."

Elizabeth heard the words as she drove up, and,
alighting tied the white pony to a post and bribed
a small boy to "keep an eye" on him. Then she
joined the group in front of the shop, who were
some waiting for the trolley, others merely passing
the time of day. She did not go into the dry-goods
shop to try to match her ribbon; she knew that
such ribbon as she wanted was not to be had at
Bassett Mills. She stood idly listening to the men's
conversation, and wondering if it were indeed true,
as the skeptic had declared, that it was useless to
pray for an event already determined by natural
causes. She had been brought up to believe implicitly
78
in the efficacy of prayer, and had added to
her usual formula that morning a petition of unwonted
fervor that she might be enabled in this
perplexing situation to decide for the best. But
perhaps there was no use in praying; perhaps one
was not a free agent. Fate, she thought, had evidently
determined that she should go to Cranston
that morning to be married, since it was a thing
that might so easily have been prevented&mdash;by an objection
from her aunts, an offer of company on the
expedition, even by the white pony going lame; she
would have yielded, or so she thought, to the merest
trifle, glad to have the decision taken out of her
hands. But everything had been made easy; it evidently
was to be. And an implicit believer in heredity
might have observed that the matter had been
decided for her, by events and influences which had
moulded her character even before she was born.
It was in just such clandestine fashion as this that
her parents had once gone up to Cranston to be
married; and it might be that some mysterious hereditary
instinct, some force over which she had no
control, was now constraining their daughter, under
the same circumstances, to act in the same way.

Elizabeth, fortunately or otherwise, did not think
of this. She only knew that she was standing outside
the drug-store with the other loiterers, straining
her eyes along the dusty white road for a sight
of the trolley; and that, even while she doubted the
wisdom of waiting, some fascination held her rooted
to the spot. When the trolley came she took her
seat at once. After all a trip to Cranston meant
79
nothing; she might simply buy her ribbon and come
back.

The trolley started off fast and jerkily, creating
a teasing wind, that seemed to blow from some fiery
furnace. Elizabeth clutched her hat with one hand,
while with the other she tried to shield her eyes
from the flying dust and glare. Soon they were past
the cemetery and the straggling outskirts of Bassett
Mills, out into the open country, with rolling meadow
and upland on either side, all withered, scorching
under the sun's fierce rays. An occasional wagon
met them, wrapped in a cloud of dust; the trolley
was hailed now and then from some solitary farm-house,
and came to a sudden stop. The ride seemed
endless, but that they were approaching Cranston
was at last made evident by unmistakable signs; by
the advertisements staring at them from trunks of
trees and the expanse of stone walls; by the asphalt
pavement that succeeded the rough country
road, the increasing quantity of bicycles, carriages
and dust; and finally by the neat rows of Queen
Anne villas, with their gabled fronts and terraced
gardens sloping to the road. Then the car, with a
last triumphant jerk, turned a corner and landed
its passengers squarely in the High Street of Cranston.

Elizabeth alighted rather limply, and stood looking
about her in a dazed sort of way. A country
woman laden with parcels addressed her timidly.
"Excuse me miss," she said, "but would you tell
me the best place to go for stockings?"

Elizabeth started and stared at her, as if the
80
simple question had been put in Hebrew. Then in
a moment she recovered herself and directed the
woman very civilly. She watched her bustle off
upon her round of errands, then turned and slowly
walked into the confectioner's shop. It was there
that she had promised to meet Paul.

There was no one, as it happened, in the front
part of the shop, where candy and cake were sold;
no one in the little restaurant at the back. Elizabeth
sat down at one of the small marble-topped
tables; her head was aching, her eyes blood-shot,
she was conscious of nothing but a feeling of pleasure
in the coolness and darkness, of relief from the
outside glare. Mechanically, she glanced at the
small mirror, that hung at an unbecoming angle opposite
on the wall, and felt a slight shock at the sight
of herself&mdash;pale, worn, with blood-shot eyes, her
white gown dusty and bedraggled. No, she did not
look well&mdash;she had never looked worse in her life.
Her lips curled in an unmirthful smile, as she
thought irrelevantly of Aunt Rebecca, and of how
she might have held forth on the folly of wearing
white for such a dusty ride. And thereupon with
a sudden pang, came the thought of Amanda&mdash;Amanda,
tossing no doubt just then in the delirium
of fever. The unpleasant idea struck Elizabeth of
a resemblance between her own white face in the
mirror, and her cousin's face as she had last seen
it, with those staring, red-rimmed eyes. Certainly,
there was a latent family likeness; but it took unbecoming
conditions such as these to bring it out.
81
She wondered languidly if any one else had ever
noticed it.

Poor Amanda! Was she still, in her delirium,
fretting over Paul? Or was she, perhaps, secure in
Elizabeth's promise, and the pleasure of having
separated them? What would she think if she knew
that Elizabeth was even now waiting for him here
in Cranston&mdash;waiting to be married to him? But
with this thought the spell of indifference which had
rested upon Elizabeth seemed suddenly to fall away,
and there swept over her a sudden sense of revolt,
of shame and repulsion. She started impulsively to
her feet. No, she could not be married&mdash;not in that
way; it was clandestine, disgraceful. There was
still time to escape. If only she could reach home,
without seeing Paul! She made one quick, blinded
rush for the door, and then, a tall figure stood in
her way, and her hands were seized in a man's eager
grasp. His handsome, exultant face looked into
hers.

"My brave girl," he said. "So you have not
failed me."


82

Chapter XI


Elizabeth with a great effort wrenched
her hands away from Paul's grasp, and fell
against one of the marble-topped tables.
Her face was white, her dull eyes looked up at him
with a sort of terror.

"I&mdash;I have failed you," she said, speaking slowly
and thickly, with parched lips. "I have come, but
I&mdash;cannot stay. I was going when you came in."

"Elizabeth!" The look of exultant joy faded
slowly and reluctantly from Paul's face. "Elizabeth,
what do you mean? Why did you come if you
don't mean to stay?"

"Because I&mdash;was crazy." She was trembling
now, and she clung to the table for support; but
still she was firm. "I&mdash;I didn't think what I did.
Now I&mdash;I know. It would be wrong to marry like
this&mdash;so secretly. I must go home. Let me pass."
She spoke the last words quickly, imperiously, and
made a motion as if to brush past him; but he stood
motionless in the door and blocked her way.

He was very angry; she had never seen him so
before. The emotion lent a curious brute strength
to his fair, sensuous beauty. His face was as white
as hers, his full red lips were set in a curve of
unwonted determination.
83

"Listen to me, Elizabeth." He had never spoken
to her in such a tone before. "I won't be trifled
with like this. I have made all the arrangements.
I won't have you&mdash;jilt me now. You must come
with me, or I&mdash;I'll know the reason why."

She met his gaze defiantly. "You can't compel
me to come you know," she said. And again she
would have passed him, and again he stopped her.
She did not try a third time, but sank into a chair
and put up her hands to her face. A sudden faintness
came over her; it might have been the heat,
or the sharp, conflicting play of emotion. He followed
her and gently took her hands from her face
and looked into her eyes.

"Don't be foolish, darling," he said, persuasively.
"You know that you love me, that you are only
playing with me. You wouldn't really throw me
over now."

She looked up reluctantly, fascinated as she had
often been before, by the mere physical attraction
of his beauty. "I&mdash;I don't know," she began slowly,
and then stopped frightened at the sound of voices
in the shop. A dread flashed over her all at once
of a scene in a place like this. The trifling, frivolous
consideration turned the scale in Paul's favor. She
rose, shook off his grasp, and gave a hasty glance
in the glass.

"No, I won't throw you over," she said. "It's
all wrong but&mdash;as you say, it's too late now. Take
care&mdash;some one is coming." She gave a warning
look at the door, as Paul pressed her hand.

So the threatened scene was averted and Elizabeth's
84
fate was sealed. The people who, after buying
candy in the shop, came into the little back
room for some ice cream, saw a young woman arranging
her hair before the glass, and a young man
waiting for her&mdash;a not unusual sight.

What followed seemed in after life a dream to
Elizabeth. There were times when she tried to
think that it had never happened; that the whole
thing was a mere figment of the imagination. But
on that day she was quite conscious that it was she
herself, in very flesh and blood, Elizabeth Van
Vorst, who walked by Paul Halleck's side through
the glaring, sunny streets of Cranston, went with
him into a dimly-lighted church, let him place a
ring upon her finger, spoke her share in the marriage
service, and wrote her maiden name for what
should have been the last time, in the parish register.
The clergyman was very old and mumbled over
the service; the witnesses, two servants of his, were
old and feeble, also, and took but small interest.
The church was damp like a tomb after the heat
without; Elizabeth found herself shivering as from
a chill. It was a relief to come out again into the
heat which had been so oppressive before. But on
the church steps Elizabeth gave a little cry. A
funeral was slowly filing past, its black trappings
standing out in incongruous gloom against the noon-day
brilliance.

Elizabeth looked at Paul. He had turned very
white, and he too was shivering. "It is a bad
omen," he said, in a low voice, as if to himself. He
said no more, but led the way carefully in the opposite
85
direction from that which the funeral had
taken.

They found themselves in a part of Cranston unknown
to Elizabeth. The road was bordered on
either side by flowering hedges and led apparently
into the open country. There were no houses in
sight; for the moment, even no people. Halleck suddenly
turned and clasped Elizabeth almost roughly
in his arms, while he pressed passionate kisses upon
her brow, her lips, her hair.

"My darling," he cried "I can't&mdash;I can't give you
up. I was mad to promise it. Let everything go
and come with me to New York."

"No, no, I can't," she murmured faintly. "I
can't." His vehemence stunned, bewildered her; but
instinctively she struggled against it. "You promised,"
she cried out indignantly, "you promised that
I should be free&mdash;till you came back. I've kept my
word, you must keep yours."

He let her go and for a moment they eyed each
other steadily. This time the victory remained with
her. "Did I really make that promise?" he said
at last with a sigh. "Well, if I did, I must keep it,
I suppose. But, Elizabeth, you must be made of
ice&mdash;you can't love me, or you wouldn't hold me to
it."

Elizabeth was chiefly conscious of an overpowering
sense of relief.

"I do love you," she said, soothingly, "but indeed
it is better&mdash;much better to let things be as we
arranged them. I can't go to New York in this
dress"&mdash;she gave a little tremulous laugh, as she
86
glanced at her fluffy muslin skirts. "Only a man
could suggest such a thing. And then my aunts!&mdash;they
would be distracted. No, no, I must go home
at once. You will be back in six months," she went
on, trying to console him. "They will pass very
quickly."

"Six months," he sighed. "It is an endless
time." He was the picture of gloom as they turned
and walked steadily back to the busy part of Cranston.
And she, too, had her regrets. The compromise
was satisfactory to neither.

At the corner of the High Street they parted.
There was no opportunity for more than a hand-clasp,
a few hurried words of farewell. Then he
went his way to the railroad station, and she hurried
to the trolley. The country woman with the
many parcels was there before her, and told where
she got the stockings, and how much she paid for
them.

Back again went the trolley, along the asphalted
road past the Queen Anne villas with their terraced
gardens, past bicycles, carriages, wagons, and always
clouds of dust; out into the open country, with
rolling meadow and upland on either side, simmering
in the heat of the summer afternoon, to which
the morning heat was as nothing; Elizabeth sitting
upright, shading her eyes from the glare, with aching
head and burning eyes, and throbbing brain that
refused to take in the reality of what she had done.
This was her wedding journey.

An hour later the white pony brought her home.
87

"Did you&mdash;did you match your ribbon, dear?"
Miss Joanna inquired anxiously. Elizabeth stared
blankly for a moment.

"I&mdash;I never thought of the ribbon," she cried at
last, and burst into hysterical laughter.

Chapter XII


It was that time of year when the Neighborhood,
and the whole riverside, are in their
glory. Day after day dawned clear and frosty,
to warm at noon-day into a mellow brilliance. On
every side stretched wooded meadow and upland
all aglow, resplendent in varied tints of crimson and
russet, magenta and scarlet, blending in a glorious
scheme of color, till they melted at last into the soft
gray haze, which rested, like a touch of regretful
melancholy, on the tops of the distant hills. Over
the fields the golden-rod was still scattered profusely,
amidst the sober browns and purples of the
bay, and the pale lavender of the Michaelmas
daisies. Red berries glistened on the bushes, the
ground was covered, every day deeper, with a carpeting
of fallen leaves and chestnut burrs.

On one of these autumn days, when the light was
fading into dusk, Mrs. "Bobby" Van Antwerp
came to call at the Homestead, and found no one
at home but Elizabeth, who was kneeling on the
hearth-rug, staring into the fire.

Elizabeth's thoughts were not pleasant ones. She
had refused to go to Cranston with her aunts that
afternoon, for she had never been near the place
since that hot July day, nearly three months before,
89
when she had forgotten to match her ribbon. What
construction her aunts placed upon the episode she
never knew. They did not allude to it in words,
but treated her with added care and solicitude, as if
she were recovering from some illness. In pursuance
of this theory, they took her to a highly recommended
and very dull seaside place, where she was
extremely bored. She returned in better health,
though hardly better spirits. She had now a new
trouble, which increased as the autumn advanced.
Paul's letters, at first many and ardent, grew fewer
and colder, till they ceased altogether. Elizabeth's
last letter remained unanswered, and she was too
proud to write again. No doubt, she told herself,
his thoughts were occupied by some new attraction.
With a sudden flash of intuition, she realized that
for Paul there would always be an attraction of
some kind, and generally a new one.

This unpleasant perception had one good result,
at least; it lightened her sense of remorse towards
Amanda. She had long ago got over the ordeal of
seeing her cousin again, and the strange scene between
them had been relegated to a curious phase
of unreality, covered up and almost obliterated, as
such scenes not infrequently are among relations and
intimate friends, by the thousand commonplace incidents
of every-day life. And yet some sort of
apology had been proffered by Amanda, as she sat
up in her white wrapper, very pale and hollow-eyed,
with her red hair cut short, and just beginning to
come in in soft waves like Elizabeth's&mdash;a thing she
had always desired.
90

"You know," she said, in her weak voice "I was
real sick that last time you saw me. I was just
coming down with the fever."

"I know you were," Elizabeth said gently, conquering
the thrill of anger which swept over her
at the recollection.

"I guess I said some queer things," Amanda ventured
next, and gave an odd, furtive look from her
light eyes.

"You certainly did," said Elizabeth, coldly. Not
all the pity she felt for Amanda's weakness could
avail to make her speak in any other way.

"Well, I guess," Amanda said, after a moment
and closing her eyes as if wearied out, "people
aren't accountable for what they say when they're
sick."

"No," said Elizabeth, "I suppose not." And
with this tacit apology and its acceptance, this episode
between the cousins might be considered closed.
Certainly, on Elizabeth's side, it was not only closed,
but forgotten, in the pressure of far more serious
troubles.

As she knelt that afternoon looking into the fire,
a vision of her future life&mdash;colorless, empty, without
joy or love&mdash;seemed to stare back at her from its
glowing depths. The years stretched out before her,
a dreary waste&mdash;without Paul. She was sure that
he would never come back; the bond between them
seemed the merest shadow. He had forgotten her
in three short months, while she was more in love
than ever, since she had never fully realized, at the
time, the void that he would leave behind him. For
91
a short time her life had bloomed like the summer;
and now nothing was left to her but the fast-approaching
gray monotony of the November days, and
the bleak cold of the winter.

Upon these cheerful reflections entered Mrs.
Bobby Van Antwerp, in a short skirt somewhat the
worse for wear, with dark eyes that shone brilliantly
beneath her battered hat, and her small piquante face
glowing with health and exercise.

"Don't get up," she said. "What a beautiful
blaze!" She sat down to it at once and held out
her small, gloveless hands to its pleasant warmth.
"I walked all the way," she announced, triumphantly,
"and I thought I would just drop in, and
perhaps you'd give me a cup of tea."

One must have lived in the Neighborhood to appreciate
the informality of all this. People paid
calls in their carriages, with their card-cases and
their best Sunday gowns&mdash;it was not good form to
come on foot, even had the distances permitted.
But the young woman always spoken of as "Mrs.
Bobby" though her claims to a more formal designation
had long since been established, was a law
unto herself and cared little what the Neighborhood's
laws might be. Elizabeth had already noticed
that this great lady, the greatest lady in the Neighborhood,
treated her with more friendliness than
other people of less assured position with whom she
was, theoretically, on more intimate terms. This
curious fact, and the cause of it, occupied her
thoughts while she rang the bell and ordered tea,
a little flustered inwardly, but outwardly calm, and
92
comfortably conscious of the becoming neatness of
her serge skirt and velveteen blouse. Whatever her
troubles might be, she had not yet reached so great
a pitch of desperation as to neglect her appearance.

"Aren't these autumn days beautiful!" said Mrs.
Bobby, making herself at home by unfastening her
coat and tossing aside her hat, whereby she disclosed
to view a somewhat tousled halo of curly
dark hair. "I tell Bobby that just these few days
in the autumn make up to us for the bother of keeping
the place, though in summer it is fearfully hot,
and unspeakably dull all the year round. It must be
very dull for you," said Mrs. Bobby, coming to a
sudden pause.

"Oh, yes, it's dull," Elizabeth admitted, with a
little sigh.

Mrs. Bobby laughed.

"Why don't you say 'oh, but I am so fond of
the place,' or 'but I'm not at all dependent on society,'
as the other girls in the Neighborhood do?"

"I don't know," said Elizabeth, reflectively. "I
don't think, for one thing, that I am so awfully fond
of the place; and as for society&mdash;I have never had
any, so naturally I get on without it."

"But you would enjoy it, if you had it?"

A curious brightness shone for an instant in
Elizabeth's eyes. "Ah, yes, I should enjoy it," she
said, quickly. "I'm sure I should."

"I'm sure you would, too," said Mrs. Bobby. She
seemed to reflect a moment. "Don't you go away in
August?" she asked at last.

"Yes, this year we did," said Elizabeth. "We
93
went to Borehaven. It&mdash;it wasn't very amusing."
She stopped short blushing as if the last words had
been wrung from her unawares; but Mrs. Bobby's
smile seemed to invite confidence.

"Tell me all about it," she said. "Was it very
terrible?"

"Yes, very," said Elizabeth, frankly. "There
were a good many girls who used to promenade up
and down, and a number of old ladies who sat in
rows on the piazza and criticized the people and
grumbled about the table; and they one and all
treated us as if we had committed some crime. We
were quite distressed till we found out that it was
nothing personal&mdash;only the way they always treat
new arrivals."

"Ah, I know the type of place," said Mrs. Bobby
"and the people. Were there any men?"

"A few who were called men&mdash;about sixteen, I
should think&mdash;most of them&mdash;but they didn't interest
me particularly." And Elizabeth blushed, as
she remembered the reason which had made her indifferent,
at least to such men as Borehaven could
boast of. Mrs. Bobby noticed the blush.

"What!" she said to herself "another attraction
in this wilderness? Not that stupid Frank Courtenay&mdash;I
hope not. Yet there isn't and never has been
another man in the place that I ever heard of."
While she pondered this problem the tea-things were
brought in, and Elizabeth seated herself at the small
table, behind the old silver urn, in the full glow of
the firelight, which played on her hair and brought
out the warm creamy tones of her skin. Mrs. Bobby
94
watched her silently with her bright dark eyes, her
small, pointed chin supported on her hand.

"You ought to go to town for the winter," she
announced at last abruptly. This seemed to be the
upshot of her reflections. Elizabeth looked up with
a little start, and a momentary brightening of the
eyes, which faded, however, instantly.

"Oh, my aunts could never bear to leave here,"
she said. "They have so taken root in this place.
Besides," she went on, constrained to greater frankness
by the consciousness of that quality in Mrs.
Bobby herself "what would be the use if we did go?
We know so few people. It would be horrid to be
in New York and not know any one or go anywhere."

"Yes, that wouldn't be pleasant," admitted Mrs.
Bobby, to whom indeed such a state of things was
inconceivable. "But you would know people," she
went on, after a moment "every one does somehow.
There are your cousins, the Schuyler Van Vorsts,
for instance."

"Who would probably never notice us," said
Elizabeth "or if they did, would ask us to a family
dinner."

"Well, that certainly would be worse than nothing,"
Mrs. Bobby admitted. "But&mdash;how about your
old school friends? You must have known some
nice girls at Madame Veuillet's. You would see, no
doubt, a great deal of them."

Elizabeth shook her head. "I doubt it," she said.
"They spoke&mdash;some of them&mdash;of asking me to stop
with them, but they have none of them done so.
95
They don't even write to me any more. It doesn't
take long for people to forget one, Mrs. Van Antwerp,"
said poor Elizabeth, putting into words the
melancholy philosophy which experience had lately
taught her.

"My dear child," cried Mrs. Van Antwerp,
"you're too young to realize that&mdash;yet." She put
out her hand in her warm, impulsive way, and
touched Elizabeth's. "I can promise you one thing,"
she said. "If you come to New York, I'll do what
I can to make it pleasant for you."

Elizabeth looked up with glistening eyes. "You're&mdash;you're
awfully kind," she began, stammering. In
another moment she would have burst into tears,
and perhaps, in the sudden expansion, confided everything
to this new friend&mdash;in which case her life's
history would have been different. But just then
she heard the sound of wheels, and immediately she
stiffened and the habit of reserve, which had been
growing upon her during the last three months, reasserted
itself. When her aunts entered, in a little
glow of excitement after their day at Cranston,
Elizabeth was sitting quite cool and placid behind
the tea-things, absorbed in the problems of milk and
sugar.

The rest of Mrs. Bobby's visit seemed to her
rather dull. They sat around the fire, and Mrs.
Bobby drank her tea and ate a great many of the
little round cakes which accompanied it, and which
she praised warmly, to the gratification of Miss Joanna,
who had made them. She told them all about
her domestic affairs, and Bobby's affairs, and the
96
family affairs generally, and was altogether very
charming and as the Misses Van Vorst expressed it,
"neighborly;" but still she said not a word further
of their going to town, or of that pleasant if rather
vague promise she had made in a moment of impulse,
which perhaps she already regretted. It was
not till she held Elizabeth's hand at parting that she
invited her, as if by a sudden thought, to dinner
on the following Friday.

"It will be dull, I'm afraid," she said. "Only
the Rector and his wife, and the Hartingtons, and
Julian Gerard, who is coming up over Sunday. You
will be the only young girl, and I want you to amuse
Julian. We dine at eight. Do come early, so we
can have a talk beforehand."

Elizabeth, entirely taken by surprise, had only
time to murmur an acceptance, when Mrs. Bobby
hurried off, being hastened by the arrival of her
husband, who had called for her and was waiting
outside in the dog-cart. "Friday, remember," she
called out from the yawning darkness beyond the
door, "and come early." Then Bobby Van Antwerp's
restless horse bore her off.

The Misses Van Vorst returned to the drawing-room,
in a state of considerable excitement.

"Think of my dining at the Van Antwerps!"
Elizabeth exclaimed, still rosy from the unexpected
honor. "I was so taken aback that I could hardly
answer properly. But how on earth am I to amuse
Julian&mdash;whoever he may be, and what have I got
to wear?"
97

"It's a&mdash;a very nice attention," said Miss Cornelia,
complacently. "She's never asked the Courtenay
girls, I know, from what their mother told me.
She said they thought it a pity she was so unsociable.
I think, sister, when we see them we
might mention that we don't find her unsociable&mdash;just
casually, you know. As for what you can
wear, my dear&mdash;either your white crepe or white
organdie is quite pretty enough, and much nicer
than anything the Courtenay girls would have."

"To think of dinner at eight o'clock!" said Miss
Joanna, who was only just recovering her powers of
speech. "So very fashionable! I wish, dear, if
you can, you would notice what they have. Mrs.
Bobby says her cook is very good at croquettes. I
wish you could tell me, dear, if they are better
than ours."

"I'm afraid I shan't be able to think of croquettes,"
said Elizabeth, "what with the burden of
being on my best behavior and entertaining Mr.
Gerard. I think by the way, that he must be that
dark man I have seen sometimes in their pew on
Sundays. Which would he like me best in, do you
suppose&mdash;the white crepe or the organdie? I must
get them both out, and decide which to wear."

Elizabeth's spirits were as easily exhilarated as
they were depressed. She ran up-stairs, humming
a gay little tune which had not come into her head
for many a day. This dinner at the Van Antwerps',
with the prospect of meeting a few of her neighbors
and apparently, one unmarried man, might have
98
seemed to many people a commonplace affair
enough; but to Elizabeth it was a great occasion,
and for the rest of the evening, bright visions of
future pleasure danced before her eyes. That night,
for the first time in many weeks, she did not cry
herself to sleep, thinking of Paul.


99

Chapter XIII


"And you really think I look nicely?"
Elizabeth asked this question in tremulous
excitement, as she stood before the
long pier-glass in her room on the night of her
first dinner-party. The maid was on her knees behind
her arranging the folds of her train, Miss Joanna
stood ready with her cloak, and Miss Cornelia
hovered a little way off, admiring the scene.
Elizabeth held her head high, there was a brilliant
color in her cheeks, her eyes shone like stars. You
would hardly have known her for the same girl
who had struggled with sad thoughts and disappointed
hopes in the twilight only a few days before.
This seemed some young princess, to whom
the good things of life came naturally, unsought,
by the royal prerogative of beauty.

"You&mdash;you look lovely," faltered Miss Cornelia,
forgetting her principles in the excitement of the
occasion "and your dress is sweet."

"It is fortunate I had it cut low, isn't it," said
Elizabeth, as she clasped a string of pearls, which
had once belonged to her grandmother, about her
round white throat. "There, do I look all right?
You're sure my skirt hangs well? I wanted a white
rose, but we have no pretty ones left." A slight
100
cloud of discontent crossed her face, but vanished
instantly; since really, as she said to herself, she
looked very nice even without flowers.

"Don't be late," entreated Miss Joanna. "Just
think if the dinner should be spoiled!"

"Yes, it would be very bad manners," added Miss
Cornelia "not to be punctual."

"I don't know," said Elizabeth, doubtfully. "It's
rather countrified to be too early." But still she
drew on her gloves and put on her cloak, and started
a good half-hour before the appointed time, in
deference to Miss Joanna's fears for the dinner and
Miss Cornelia's sense of the value of punctuality.

The clock was striking eight as she entered the
wide hall of the Van Antwerps's house, and read,
or fancied that she did, in the solemn butler's immobile
countenance, an assurance that she was unfashionably
prompt. The demure little maid who
followed him and took Elizabeth's cloak, regretted
to inform her that Mrs. Van Antwerp was not quite
ready, but would be down directly, and hoped that
Miss Van Vorst would excuse her unpunctuality.
Elizabeth's heart sank, but the maid was ushering
her into the drawing-room, and there was no retreat.
Yet she shrank back involuntarily, as the long room
yawned before her, empty, except for one person
whom she did not know; and thus she stood for a
moment hesitating, her warm Titian coloring framed
against the dark plush of the portiere, and her white
gown falling about her in graceful folds, of a
statuesque simplicity almost severe, but from which
her youth and rounded curves emerged all the more
101
triumphant. Her heart beat fast and there was a
deep burning color in her cheeks, but she held herself
erect, with the proud little turn of the head
that seemed to come to her by nature.

The tall dark man who was turning over the
leaves of a magazine at the end of the room, looked
up as she entered and gazed at her for a moment in
silence. Their eyes met; for an instant he seemed
to hesitate. Then he rose and walked slowly towards
her.

"You must let me introduce myself, Miss Van
Vorst," he said, and his voice was like his movements,
very deliberate, yet it was clear-cut and pleasant
in tone. "My name is Gerard. Mrs. Van Antwerp
told me I should have the pleasure of taking
you in to dinner."

He spoke so quietly and naturally, and seemed to
accept the situation with such absolute indifference,
that whatever awkwardness it might have contained
for a young girl nervous over her first dinner, was
instantly removed. Elizabeth felt grateful, and yet
perversely a little piqued that this grave, dark man
should place her at a disadvantage, that he should
be perfectly at home and know exactly what to do,
when she was nervous and flustered. But that kind
Providence which had endowed Elizabeth with so
many good gifts had given her among others a
power to cover inward perturbation with a brave
show of self-possession.

"I'm terribly early," she was able to say now,
quite lightly and easily, though still with that uncomfortable
beating of the heart. "My aunts are
102
very old-fashioned, and insist on punctuality as one
of the cardinal virtues."

"In which they are quite right, I think," said
Mr. Gerard, smiling. "But when you know Mrs.
Van Antwerp well, you will have learned that it is
the one virtue in which she is utterly lacking."

"I&mdash;I don't know her very well," Elizabeth admitted,
regretting somewhat that she could not assert
the contrary. "I have never even been here
before," she added, glancing about the room, whose
stateliness was a little overpowering.

"Really! Then wouldn't you&mdash;a&mdash;like to come
into the conservatory and look at the flowers?"
suggested Mr. Gerard, who seemed to have charged
himself with the duties of host. "Oh, you needn't
wait for Mrs. Van Antwerp," he added, smiling, as
Elizabeth hesitated. "I know the time when she
went to dress, and can assert with confidence that
she won't be down for another half-hour."

So Elizabeth found herself led, somewhat against
her will, into the famous conservatory, of whose
beauties she had often heard; but with which, it
must be confessed, she was less occupied than with
the man by her side, at whom she cast furtive glances
from beneath her long lashes. He was tall&mdash;decidedly
taller than herself, though she was a tall
woman, and rather broadly built than otherwise.
His dark, smooth-shaven face, which had lighted up
pleasantly when he smiled, was in repose rather
heavy and impassive, with an ugly, square chin, that
seemed to indicate an indomitable will, of a kind
to pursue tenaciously whatever he might desire. In
103
contradiction to this, his eyes, except when a passing
gleam of interest or amusement brightened their
sombre depths, had a weary indifferent look, as if
there were nothing in the world, on the whole, worth
desiring.

"And this is the man," thought Elizabeth, "whom
I am expected to amuse. He doesn't look as if it
would be an easy task. But no doubt Mrs. Bobby
has given him the same charge about me, and he
is trying, conscientiously, to obey. That's why he's
taken me in here to show me the sights, the way
they do to the country visitors." Her heart leaped
rebelliously at the thought, even while she was saying
aloud mechanically: "'What a fine azalea!' I
wonder if I look like a countrified production. My
gown isn't, at least; but then&mdash;he wouldn't appreciate
that fact. It probably would be the same to him,
if it came out of the Ark; he isn't the sort of man
to notice, one way or the other. I don't believe he
cares for women&mdash;no, nor they for him. He's not
at all good-looking, and he must be&mdash;thirty-five"&mdash;she
ventured another glance. "Oh, that, at least.
His hair is quite gray on the temples. 'Yes, those
orchids are beautiful. I never saw anything like
them.' I must do my duty and admire properly;
he thinks me very unsophisticated, no doubt. I don't
think I like him. Did Mrs. Bobby think it would
amuse me to&mdash;amuse him? But perhaps he is thinking
the same thing about me." And she stole another
glance at his face, but could not read, in his
half-closed eyes and unmoved expression, any indication
of his real feelings.
104

They had made the round of the conservatory,
when suddenly he stopped. "Don't you&mdash;want a
flower for your gown," he asked. He looked about
him reflectively. "Let me see," he said. "You
would like it to be white." Elizabeth wondered how
he knew that. After a moment's hesitation, he
chose a white rose and gave it to her. She fastened
it carefully in her gown, where its green leaves
formed the only touch of color.

"How does it look?" she asked innocently, and
raised her eyes to his, where unexpectedly they encountered
an odd gleam, of something that seemed
neither wholly interest nor yet amusement, and that
made her look down again quickly, while the warm
color mantled in her cheeks. It was a moment before
he answered her.

"It looks well," he said then, quietly, "and suits
your gown." And they sauntered back slowly to the
drawing-room.

Mrs. Bobby came hurrying in by the opposite door,
fastening as she went the diamond star in her black
lace.

"My dear child," she said, kissing Elizabeth,
"what must you think of me! It is all Bobby's
fault for taking us such a long drive, and I see
he is not down yet either, the wretch! But Julian
has been entertaining you, so it is all right. I'm
afraid though that he has been taking away my
character unmercifully, telling you that I am always
late, and other pleasing things of the kind."

Gerard's smile again softened his face. "Do
me justice, Eleanor," he said. "You know I don't
105
say worse things of my friends behind their backs
than I do to their faces."

She laughed. "I should be sorry for them if you
did," she returned. "But here," she went on, as
voices were heard in the hall, "here, in good time,
are the Rector and his wife. What a blessing they
didn't arrive sooner!"

The words had hardly left her lips before the
Rector and his wife were ushered in, the latter uttering
voluble apologies for being late, and laying all
the blame on the erratic behavior of the village hackman,
who feeling an utter contempt for people who
did not keep their own carriages, reserved the privilege
of calling for them at what hour he pleased.
The theme of his unpunctuality was so engrossing
that the Rector's wife would have enlarged on it
for some time, had she not caught sight of Elizabeth,
and in her surprise subsided into a chair and
momentary silence. And then strolled in Bobby
Van Antwerp, fair, well-groomed, amiable, and
mildly bored at the prospect of entertaining his
neighbors; and immediately afterwards followed the
Hartingtons, still more bored at the prospect of
being entertained; after which they all went in to
dinner, and Elizabeth found herself seated between
the Rector and Gerard.

"You live here all the year round, don't you?"
the latter said to her, somewhere about the third
course, when he had given utterance to several other
conventional remarks, and she had grown accustomed
to the multiplicity of forks at her plate, and
had decided that the light of wax candles, beaming
106
softly under rose-colored shades, was eminently becoming
to every one. She looked at him now with
an odd little challenge in her eyes, called forth, in
spite of herself, by the wearied civility of his conversational
efforts.

"Yes, I live here all the year round," she said, in
her clear, flute-like voice. "I&mdash;I'm a country girl,
you see."

He smiled. "You are to be congratulated, I
think."

"Do you think so?" asked Elizabeth, in genuine
surprise.

"Why, yes, I love the country; don't you," he
said tranquilly.

She was silent for a moment, her eyes resting
absently on the graceful erection of ferns in the
centre of the table, which rose, like a fairy island,
from a lake of glass. "It's not a conventional thing
to say," she answered at last, slowly "but if you
want the truth"&mdash;

"I always want the truth," said Gerard.

"Well, then, I don't think I do care for the
country," she said. "I've had too much of it. I&mdash;there
are times when I detest it." She spoke with
sudden vehemence, and she met his wondering gaze
with eyes that were curiously hard.

Gerard's face clouded. "You don't care for the
country," he said, slowly, "and yet you live here
all the year round?"

"Ah, that's the very reason," she said, lightly.
"People always tell you that you don't appreciate
107
your blessings; but how can you reasonably be expected
to, when you don't have any voice in choosing
them?"

"If you did, you probably wouldn't like them
any better," he retorted. "And it would be more
annoying to think that you had had a voice in the
matter and had chosen wrong."

"Perhaps," said Elizabeth, "but I should like to
make the experiment." And she stared again
thoughtfully at the feathery forms of the ferns.

"Well, if you had your choice," said Gerard,
lazily, "what would you choose as an improvement
on the present state of things?"

She turned towards him with a slight start.
"What should I choose," she said, slowly "as an
improvement on my life just now?"

"Yes, if you had a fairy Godmother," suggested
Gerard.

"With unlimited power?" questioned Elizabeth.

He laughed. "Well, not quite that, perhaps," he
said, "but&mdash;a fairy Godmother who could give you
a good deal. A very charming one, too," he added,
in a low voice.

Elizabeth knit her brows and pouted out her full
lips, in apparently deep reflection. "If I had a fairy
Godmother," she said, musingly, "and she were to
give me three wishes&mdash;three, you know, is the magic
number in the fairy tales&mdash;why, I should choose first
of all, I think, a season in town"&mdash;

"Which you might tire of in a month," suggested
Gerard.
108

"Not at all," said Elizabeth, decidedly, "because
my second wish would be for the capacity to be always
amused."

"And do you really think," said Gerard, "that
you would like that&mdash;to go through life as if it were
a sort of opera bouffe?"

"Why not?" said Elizabeth. "I'm a frivolous
person. I confess I like opera bouffe."

"For an evening, perhaps," said Gerard, "but
after a time you'd get tired of it&mdash;oh, yes, I'm
sure you would&mdash;and you'd begin to think"&mdash;

"Ah, no, I shouldn't," she interrupted him,
eagerly "for that's what my third wish should be. I
should ask for the power never to think. Thought&mdash;thought
is horrible." She spoke the last words
very low, more to herself than him, and broke off
suddenly, as an odd, frightened look crept into
her eyes. Gerard watched her in some perplexity.

"This girl," he said to himself "who must be,
I suppose, somewhere about twenty, and has seen,
according to Eleanor, nothing of the world, talks
sometimes like a thoughtless child, and sometimes
like a woman of thirty, and an unhappy one at that.
I can't quite make her out." Aloud he said, in an
odd, dry voice that he had not hitherto used towards
her, "Now that you have pretty well in theory at
least, reduced yourself to the level of a brainless
doll, why not ask, now that you are about it, for the
power not to feel? Then you would really be a complete
automaton, and nothing on earth could have
power to hurt you."

Elizabeth had grown very pale, and her hands
109
were tightly locked together under the table. "Ah,"
she said, wearily "I've exhausted my three wishes.
And, besides, it's too much to ask. No fairy Godmother,
I'm afraid, could give one the power not
to feel."

"Be thankful for that," he said, quickly. "A
woman who has no capacity for suffering is&mdash;is&mdash;would
be unspeakably repellant."

"Would she?" said Elizabeth, dreamily. "I
should think, for my part, that she would be rather
enviable." She sat staring absently before her, and
Gerard did not try to break the silence. In a moment
Mrs. Hartington on his other side claimed
his attention, and Elizabeth was not sorry. She
felt vaguely resentful towards him for having made
her think of unpleasant things, which she had resolved
not to do that evening. The dinner went
on, and she helped herself mechanically to dish after
dish which was pressed upon her. The Rector
turned to her and made a few labored remarks,
adapted as he thought to her youthful intelligence,
and she answered them absently. Bobby Van Antwerp
told, in a languid way, a funny story for the
benefit of the table, and the conversation grew general
for awhile. Dinner was nearly over when Gerard
said, turning to her with a pleasant smile:

"I'm not a prophet, and yet I am going to venture
on a prediction. In a little while, I think, you'll
find your fairy Godmother, and have your season
in town, though I don't know if the other things will
be thrown in; and then some time in the course of
it, I'll ask you if you are satisfied, and you'll tell
110
me perhaps, that you are sick of it all, and are pining
for the country, the green fields, and&mdash;a&mdash;the
view of the river"&mdash;

He stopped as Elizabeth interrupted him flippantly.
"Oh, no, never," she cried. "I'd prefer
city streets to green fields any day, and as for the
river&mdash;I've looked at it all my life, and I'm afraid
I've exhausted its possibilities." She was quite herself
again, her cheeks were pink; she looked up at
him with laughing eyes. "Confess that you think
me terribly frivolous," she said; "confess that you
disapprove of me entirely."

"On the contrary," said Gerard, with rather a
cold smile "I think there is a good deal to be said
for your point of view&mdash;and as for disapproval,
that's a priggish sensation that I hope I don't allow
myself to feel towards any one. Wait till I see you
in town," he went on, more genially "and then perhaps
we'll agree better."

"Ah, but you never will see me in town," she
said, sadly.

"Never?" he returned, slightly raising his eye-brows.
"That's rather a rash prediction. I think
I may have the pleasure of meeting you there before
very long. You see I believe in fairy Godmothers,"
he added, lightly, as Mrs. Bobby gave the signal,
and, rising, he pushed back Elizabeth's chair.

She paused for a moment, as she gathered up in
one hand the soft white folds of her gown. "I
wish your faith could perform miracles," she said.
And then she followed dreamily in the wake of the
well-worn black satin gown, which had been seen,
111
on many another festive occasion, on the broad back
of the Rector's wife.

"He does disapprove of me," the girl thought to
herself. "He would have liked me better if I were
a little bread-and-butter miss, in white muslin and
blue ribbons, who babbled of green fields and taught
a class in Sunday school. That's the kind of woman
he admires. He thinks me hard and flippant, but&mdash;I
don't care. At least he dropped that weary,
society manner. It is something to have inspired
him with an emotion of some sort, even if it happens
to be disapproval."

Chapter XIV


The Rector's wife, after the first surprise,
was very glad to see Elizabeth. It made
her feel more at home, and she drew her
down now eagerly, beside her on the sofa by the
fire, whose warmth on that autumn evening modified
the somewhat chill atmosphere of the state
drawing-room.

"My dear Elizabeth, I never expected to see you
here." Increased respect mingled with the surprise
in her tone. Elizabeth had certainly gone up several
degrees in her estimation. "It's quite an honor to
be asked&mdash;the Courtenays never are, I know, though
don't repeat that I said so. Of course we are asked
every year, as is only due, you know, to the Rector's
position, my dear; but almost always the children
are ill, or something goes wrong, and it's three
years now since we've been able to come. It was
unfortunate our being late this time. Do you think
Mrs. Bobby was much annoyed?" The Rector's
wife lowered her voice anxiously, as she for the
first time waited for a response.

"Oh, no," Elizabeth was able truthfully to assure
her. "I'm sure she wasn't annoyed."

"Well, to be sure, the Hartingtons were later"&mdash;in
a tone of relief&mdash;"but these great swells can
113
do as they please. You look very nice, Elizabeth,
very nice indeed. I never saw that dress before.
It must be pleasant to have something new occasionally"&mdash;and
the Rector's wife gave a gentle sigh.
"You see I have had the color changed on this
dress&mdash;red, I think, makes it look quite different,
and it is warm and pretty for the autumn. Don't
repeat this, Elizabeth, but I wore the same dress
here the last time I came to dinner four years ago&mdash;only
then it was trimmed with pale blue. It was
summer, you see, so it looked cool. Do you suppose
Mrs. Bobby would remember?"

"Oh, I don't suppose Mrs. Bobby cares"&mdash;Elizabeth
began absently "much about dress," she
added, hastily. She was looking vaguely about her,
wondering as the familiar voice meandered on, if
she were really at dinner at the Van Antwerps', or
prosaically seated as she had so often been before,
in the Rectory parlor.

Mrs. Hartington, a large fair woman, very splendidly
dressed, had seized upon Mrs. Bobby and was
talking to her on a sofa at the other end of the room.

"So you have taken up the Van Vorst girl," she
was saying, as she surveyed Elizabeth through her
lorgnette. "She is really quite pretty, and&mdash;a&mdash;not
bad form. That gown of hers is effective&mdash;it's so
simple. I wonder how she learned to dress herself,
here in the country."

"Oh, she's learned more than that, Sybil, I
imagine," said Mrs. Bobby, in level tones. "I think
her very good form, and extremely pretty. Her coloring
is very picturesque, and quite natural." This
114
very innocently, without a glance at the conspicuously
blonde hair which her friends said had not
been bestowed on Sybil Hartington by nature.

"She inherits it from her mother, I suppose&mdash;a
red-haired bar-maid, wasn't she?" said Mrs. Hartington,
again subjecting Elizabeth to a prolonged
scrutiny. "After all, she lacks distinction," she
announced, dropping her lorgnette and turning to
more important subjects.

Mrs. Bobby did not enjoy that half-hour after
dinner; neither, perhaps, did Elizabeth, who had
heard several times already the account of the attack
of measles from which the Rectory children
had lately recovered, and was glad when the men
appeared in the midst of it. But if she had expected
Mr. Gerard to come up to her to resume their
conversation, as perhaps she had, in spite of her
consciousness of his disapproval, she was destined
to be disappointed. Gerard did give her one long
look, as she sat in the full glow of the firelight; but
he turned almost immediately and spoke to Mrs.
Hartington, who had, indeed, the air of confidently
expecting him to do so. It was Bobby Van Antwerp
who sauntered up to Elizabeth, hospitably intent
on making her feel at home.

"It was awfully good of you to come to-night,
Miss Van Vorst. These dinner-parties in the country
are stupid things, but, after all, it's a way of
seeing something of one's neighbors. I think you're
too unsociable here, as a rule. It's a bore of course
to take one's horses out at night, but if one always
115
thought of that, one would never go anywhere."

"I'm sure," Elizabeth said sincerely, "I was very
glad to come. A dinner-party is a great event to
me."

"Ah, well, it is dull here for a young girl," said
Bobby, kindly. "My wife finds it very dull; but
she knows I'm fond of the old place, and she comes
to please me. You and she must try to amuse each
other. You know, between ourselves"&mdash;lowering
his voice&mdash;"Eleanor doesn't always take to people;
it has made some of our neighbors around here feel
rather sore&mdash;I'm afraid. But she does take to you,
and so I hope we shall see a great deal of you."

Elizabeth smiled and murmured her thanks, wondering
greatly to find herself thus singled out from
the rest of the Neighborhood; and just then Mrs.
Bobby came up and took her hand.

"Come," she said, "I want you to play for me.
I'm so fond of music, and I've heard that you play
beautifully."

"Ah, but I don't," Elizabeth protested; but still
she allowed herself to be led to the piano, without
undue reluctance. And then that grand piano, with
the name of the maker had been tempting her to try
it ever since dinner-time.

After all, it is doubtful if Mrs. Bobby cared so
very much for music; but it is possible she knew of
some one else who did. Elizabeth had a gift which
had come to her, Heaven knows how!&mdash;a gift in
which far greater pianists are sometimes lacking&mdash;the
116
power to throw herself into what she played and
to infuse into it something of her own personality.
Her playing seemed no mere, mechanical repetition
of what she had been taught, but the unstudied, spontaneous
expression of her own thoughts and feelings.
As she passed at Mrs. Bobby's request from
one thing to another, mingling more set compositions
with fragments from operas and songs of the day,
the conversation between Mrs. Hartington and Gerard
slackened, and he glanced more and more frequently
towards the piano.

"Music is rather a bore&mdash;isn't it&mdash;after dinner
this way," drawled Mrs. Hartington, noticing this
fact.

"I don't think I agree with you. I'm fond of
music," said Gerard, and after awhile he found an
opportunity to saunter over to the piano, where
Elizabeth sat playing, a little absently now, bits
from Wagner. She started and looked up, blushing
slightly, as Gerard asked her if she could play the
Fire-music.

"I&mdash;it is a long time since I have tried it," she
began, impelled by some vague instinct to refuse,
and then she stopped, and almost unconsciously
her fingers touched the keys, as she caught a look
that seemed to compel obedience. He smiled.

"Please play it," he said, and though the tone
was caressing, there lurked in it a half perceptible
note of command. She felt it, as she began to play,
and he stood listening, his grave eyes fixed upon
her face. "A severe judge," she thought to herself
with a proud little thrill of rebellion. And
117
then, as she played on, she forgot this thought, and
the fear of his criticism; forgot the strange room,
and the strange people, and the fact that she was
dining at the Van Antwerps'; forgot everything but
the eyes fixed upon her, and played as she had never
played before.

Elizabeth had always put the best of herself into
her music, her finest qualities of brain and soul. But
now she put into it something of which she before
was hardly conscious, a force and depth and fire,
which stirred inarticulately within her, and found
expression in the throbbing Wagnerian chords. All
the magic of the fairy spell thrilled beneath her
touch, as it rose and fell and wove itself in and out
amidst the clash of conflicting motives, while
Brünnhilde sank ever deeper into slumber, and the
flames leaped and danced and played about her sleeping
form, and there lurked no premonition in her
maiden dreams of that fatal, all-engrossing love,
which was yet to awaken her from the serenity of
oblivion. Then, as the rippling cadence died away,
Elizabeth hesitated for a moment, striking furtive
harmonies, till she passed at length into the poignant
sweetness, the passionate self-surrender of the second
act of Tristan, and so on to the Liebestod, with
its swan-song of triumphant anguish, of love supreme
even in death. With the last sobbing chord,
Elizabeth's hands fell from the keys, and she sat
staring straight before her, with eyes that were unusually
large and dark.

"Upon my word she can play," said Bobby Van
Antwerp, and looked, for him, slightly stirred.
118
"She has temperament," Mrs. Hartington coldly responded
and again honored Elizabeth with a prolonged
stare. "My dear child," exclaimed Elizabeth's
hostess, "I had no idea you could play like
that." The only person who said nothing was the
man for whom she had played. He stood motionless
by the piano, and his face was white and set. When
the applause of the others had ceased, and Elizabeth,
blushing now and smiling, looked up at him in involuntary
surprise at his silence as if from a dream,
he started and then, recovering himself, he spoke
mechanically a few conventional words of thanks,
and without comment on her performance, turned
abruptly away.

Elizabeth still sat, a trifle dazed, at the piano, her
hands tightly clasped in her lap. Her cheeks were
burning painfully and she bit her lip to keep back
the tears that sprang unbidden to her eyes. She
seemed to have fallen suddenly from the clouds back
to earth. After a moment she rose and went over to
her hostess to say farewell.

"Don't go," Mrs. Bobby entreated, holding her
hand, "I really haven't seen anything of you."

"I must go, thank you," Elizabeth said, quietly.
"William,"&mdash;this was the gardener, who on state
occasions officiated as coachman&mdash;"will be furious
if he is kept waiting."

She felt a sudden eagerness to be gone, and Mrs.
Bobby admitted the force of her excuse and parted
with her reluctantly. Both Bobby and Gerard escorted
her into the hall, but it was Gerard who placed
119
her in the carriage, and yet, as he did so, said not a
word further of seeing her again.

"He probably doesn't wish to," thought Elizabeth,
"now that he has done his duty to the last."
The reflection was the only unpleasant one that she
brought away from an otherwise successful evening.

Gerard sauntered back into the drawing-room, and
stood leaning against the mantel-piece, gazing with
thoughtful eyes into the fire, while, as it leaped and
flickered, and sent out glowing tongues of flame, a
woman's face looked up at him framed in her shimmering
hair, and the magic of the fire-music still
rang in his ear, mingled with the more passionate
strains of Tristan, the deeper tragedy of Liebestod.

He had been standing thus a long time when Mrs.
Bobby came and stood beside him. The other guests
had left and Bobby had gone off to his den.

"Well," she said tentatively, glancing up smiling
into his face, "well, Julian, what did you think of
her?"

He started and looked at her blankly for a moment.
"Think of&mdash;whom, Eleanor?" he asked.

"You know whom I mean&mdash;Elizabeth Van
Vorst."

Gerard's eyes wandered back to the fire, where
they rested for a moment absently. "I think," he
said at last slowly, and as if weighing his words
with more than his wonted deliberation, "I think
there's too much red in her hair."

"Too much red in her hair," Mrs. Bobby repeated
120
blankly; then recovering herself: "But there
isn't any, Julian, or very little. I call her hair
golden, not red."

"Look at it in the fire-light," Gerard insisted imperturbably,
"and you will see that it's a deep red."

"Well, and if it is," said Mrs. Bobby&mdash;"not that
I admit for a moment that you are right&mdash;but if it
is, red hair is all the fashion nowadays."

"No doubt," said Gerard. "It's a matter of
taste. But for myself I never see a red-haired
woman"&mdash;He stopped, but went on presently with
an effort. "I never see a red-haired woman, that
I don't instinctively avoid her. Yes, it's a&mdash;a superstition,
if you will. I feel that she will be dangerous,
somehow or another, perhaps to herself, and
certainly to others." A note of unwonted feeling
thrilled his voice. He broke off suddenly and stared
again into the fire.

Mrs. Bobby sat and watched him in silence. "And
so," she said to herself, "that woman's hair was
red."

"You see," said Gerard, presently, looking at
her with a smile, "I've shown the confidence I repose
in you by confessing my pet superstition. Miss
Van Vorst's hair is not very red, I admit, except
in some lights, but still it's&mdash;it's red enough to be
dangerous; and that fact, and certain other little
things I've noticed about her, incline me to&mdash;to avoid
her. She puzzles me; I can't quite make her out.
Still, she is certainly a girl whom a great many men
would&mdash;would admire. I'm no criterion, I believe."

"I hope not, I'm sure," said Mrs. Bobby, ruefully
121
"for the sake of most of the women I know. My
dear Julian, I despair of ever getting you married."

"My dear Eleanor, if you would only stop trying.
Your efforts are, if you will excuse my saying
so, a little too transparent. Do you suppose that
I imagined this evening that your unpunctuality was
entirely accidental?"

"Imagine what you will, you marvel of astuteness,"
said Eleanor, composedly. "I certainly did
not intend to hurry down while I knew Elizabeth
to be in such good hands, as I admit yours to be,
in spite of certain faults which I hope marriage will
improve. And that's why I don't relax my efforts,
as you call them, while there is such a superfluity
of nice girls in the world, and such an insufficiency
of nice men to deserve them. But I'm disappointed
about&mdash;about Elizabeth Van Vorst," she went on,
musingly. "I thought&mdash;I don't know why, Julian&mdash;but
I thought that you would like her."

Gerard started. "I never said that I&mdash;didn't like
her," he observed.

"No, but your remarks seemed to point in that
direction. Now I like her very much. Indeed, to
return your confidence with another, Julian"&mdash;she
looked up with a smile&mdash;"I was thinking, if Bobby
approves, of asking her to spend the winter with
me.

"I knew that," he returned, calmly, "and I approve
of the plan highly. It will be a pleasant
change for her, as she doesn't seem exactly satisfied
with her surroundings; and for you it will be a&mdash;a"&mdash;he
paused, apparently in search of an
122
appropriate word&mdash;"an interesting study," he concluded.

She looked up in surprise. "A&mdash;a study," she
repeated.

"Yes, a study&mdash;to see what a girl like that, with
the somewhat odd antecedents that you told me
about once, and some contradictory characteristics
that I think she has&mdash;to see how she develops in the
storm and stress of a New York season. I&mdash;I
think you will find it quite interesting, Eleanor."

"I'm glad you think so," she returned, softly.
"But&mdash;how about yourself, Julian? Couldn't you&mdash;just
on general psychological principles&mdash;condescend
to take an interest in it, too?"

A shadow fell on Gerard's face. "Oh, for myself,"
he said, carelessly, "I'm not easily interested in
things nowadays, and above all not&mdash;thank Heaven!
not in women." He paused. "All the same," he
added, "you have the best wishes&mdash;for the success
of your protégée." And with this he bade her good-night,
and left her.

She sat for a long time without moving, and
watched the fire flicker and die away.

"On the whole, I'm rather glad her hair is red&mdash;in
certain lights at least," she observed at last, apparently
to the smouldering embers. "It&mdash;it makes
the study still more interesting."

Chapter XV


When Eleanor Van Antwerp had uttered
the words "If Bobby approves," she
had given voice to a purely conventional
formula; for when, in the eight years of their
married life, had Bobby not approved of anything
that she might chance to desire? She did not suppose
for a moment that he would object to her asking
Elizabeth Van Vorst, or any one under the sun, to
spend the winter, and when, the next morning, she
paid him a visit in his den, where he was supposed
to be transacting important business, and proved to
be enjoying a novel and a cigar, she was still, as she
asked his permission to carry out her new plan,
merely paying a graceful concession to the perfunctory
and outworn theory of his supremacy.
Bobby listened placidly, puffing at his cigar, his
clear-cut, clean-shaven profile, outlined against the
window-pane seeming absolutely impassive in the
gray light of the autumn day. But when she concluded,
and was waiting, all aglow with her own
enthusiasm, for his answer, he turned his blue eyes
towards her with an unusually thoughtful look.

"Well," she said, impatiently, as he still declined
to commit himself, "what do you think?"
124

"What do I think," he repeated, slowly, "of your
asking Elizabeth Van Vorst to spend the winter?"

"Why, yes, I don't want to do it, dear, of course,
unless you approve."

"Well, then," said Bobby, calmly, "if you ask
my candid opinion, I think it would be a mistake.
I&mdash;I'd rather you didn't Eleanor, really I would."

"Bobby," Eleanor Van Antwerp stared at her
husband in incredulous amazement. "Bobby, you
don't mean to say that you don't want me to ask
her?"

"That's about it." Bobby paused and reflectively
knocked the ashes from his cigar. "You see," he
went on, argumentatively "this is the way I look
at it. The girl is good-looking, and all that, and
it's very nice for you to see something of her up
here, and I'm only too glad, for it's awfully sweet
of you, darling, to come here on my account, and
I've always been sorry that there wasn't some woman
whom you could be friends with. But to ask
a girl to spend the winter, and introduce her to people,
is&mdash;is a responsibility; and if you want to ask
any one&mdash;why, I'd rather it were some girl whom
I know all about&mdash;that's all."

It was not often that Bobby made such a long
speech. His wife could hardly hear him to the end
of it. "But, my dear Bobby" she exclaimed,
breaking in upon his last words, "you know all
about Elizabeth Van Vorst!"

"Do I," said Bobby, quietly. "I know that her
father was a fool, and that her mother was&mdash;worse.
125
Perhaps it would be better if I didn't know quite
so much, Eleanor."

"For Heaven's sake, don't harp on what happened
centuries ago," cried Mrs. Bobby, who had
not been born in the neighborhood. "I've always
thought it a shame the way people here snub that
poor girl. People can't help what their fathers and
mothers were like. If mine were fairly respectable,
I'm sure it's no credit to me."

"None at all," Bobby assented, "but still you'd
feel rather badly if they were not. It's a natural
feeling, Eleanor. I'm not a crank about family,
but on general principles, I think a girl whose
mother was a lady is more apt to behave herself
than one whose mother was&mdash;well, quite the reverse."

"And on general principles," said Eleanor,
quickly "I agree with you, but I think Elizabeth
Van Vorst the exception that proves the rule."

"Then I would rather," said Bobby, tranquilly,
"that it were proved under some one else's auspices
than yours."

"But that doesn't seem likely, under the circumstances,"
exclaimed his wife, impatiently. "Really,
Bobby, you disappoint me. I never supposed you
had such narrow-minded ideas. The girl has been
very well brought up by those dear old aunts, and
she is perfectly well-bred. And I'm sure there is
plenty of good blood in the family as well as bad.
The Schuyler Van Vorsts are their cousins, and lots
of old Dutch families. I dare say, if we went far
126
enough back, we'd find ourselves related to them,
too."

"I dare say," said Bobby, resignedly, "if we went
far enough back, we'd find ourselves related to a
lot of queer people. But we don't, thank Heaven!
have to ask them to visit us."

"Ah, well, I see you are hopelessly opposed to my
plan," said Mrs. Bobby, changing her tactics, "and
of course, dear, as I told you before, I wouldn't think
of asking any one unless you approve."

"Oh, I don't really care," said Bobby, somewhat
taken aback by this sudden surrender. "Ask any one
you please. You know I never interfere with your
plans. Only don't blame me if they turn out badly&mdash;that's
all."

"Ah, but they never do," cried Mrs. Bobby, "at
least this one won't, I'm sure. I really have set my
heart on it, Bobby," she went on, pleadingly. "The
truth is, though I don't often speak of it, going out
has been a weariness, and that big house in town
seems horribly empty since&mdash;since the baby died."
Her lip trembled and she paused for a moment, while
Bobby turned and stared fixedly out of the window
at the brilliantly-tinted leaves that a chill east wind
was whirling inexorably to the ground. "I
thought," she went on presently, in a voice that was
not quite steady, "that if I had some one with me
to make the house seem a little brighter&mdash;some
young girl whom I could take with me on the same
old round that I'm so sick of&mdash;why, I could look at
life through her eyes, and it would seem more
worth while. But of course Bobby," she concluded,
127
earnestly, "I wouldn't for the world do anything to
which you really object."

"My dear Eleanor," said Bobby, turning round
at this and speaking for him quite solemnly. "You
know I don't object to anything in the world that
could make you happy."

And so Mrs. Bobby had her own way.

It was on Saturday that this conversation took
place; and on Sunday afternoon they all walked
over to the Homestead&mdash;Mrs. Bobby, her husband
and Gerard. Elizabeth had been prepared for their
coming, by a whisper from Mrs. Bobby after church;
and tea was all ready for them with Miss Joanna's
cakes, and a fire that was welcome after the cold
out-doors, where the bleak east wind was still robbing
the trees of their glory and ushering in prematurely
the dull grayness of November. Mrs.
Bobby was not satisfied till she could draw Elizabeth
to a distant sofa, and deliver the invitation which
she felt, in her impetuous fashion, she could not
withhold for another day.

But though the first of Elizabeth's wishes was
thus fulfilled with a promptness most unusual outside
of fairy tales, she did not accept with the enthusiasm
that might have been expected. For a
moment, indeed, her eyes sparkled, her cheeks
glowed with delight. And then of a sudden the
color faded, her eyes fell, she shrank back as if
frightened at the idea.

"I&mdash;I&mdash;it's awfully sweet of you, Mrs. Van Antwerp,"
she said, low and hurriedly, "but I&mdash;I
can't go&mdash;I wish I could, but I can't. Don't&mdash;don't
128
ask me." It was almost as if she had said, "Don't
tempt me." Poor Mrs. Bobby, whose intentions
were so good, was exceedingly puzzled and not a
little piqued.

"Oh, well, if you don't care to come," she said,
coldly, in the great-lady manner which she seldom
assumed, "of course I shall not urge you. I
shouldn't have mentioned the subject, if I had not
thought from what you said the other day, that you
were really anxious to come to town."

"So I was, so I am&mdash;for some reasons; but for
others&mdash;Dear Mrs. Van Antwerp," the girl pleaded,
"don't think me ungrateful. I should love to come
beyond anything, but&mdash;but I can't. It doesn't seem
right," she added, more firmly.

"Doesn't seem right," repeated Mrs. Bobby, wondering,
"You mean on your aunts' account. You
think it wouldn't be right to leave them?"

"Yes," Elizabeth assented, as if relieved at being
furnished with an excuse of some sort, however
feeble, "I don't think it would be right to leave
them."

"But that is nonsense," cried Mrs. Bobby.
"They will miss you terribly, of course, but it will
be no worse than when you were at school, and they
would be the first to wish you to go, I'm sure."

Elizabeth was quite sure of it, too. Mrs. Bobby,
reading this conviction in her eyes, and all the more
anxious for the success of her plan, now that it met
with so many unexpected obstacles, went on to expatiate
on the delights of a season in town, and all
the possibilities that life can offer, to one who has
129
youth, talent and beauty. Elizabeth listened eagerly
with dilating eyes, which she only once withdrew
from Mrs. Bobby's face, to glance across to the other
end of the room, where Mr. Gerard was leaning
forward in an attitude of respectful interest, as he
talked to Miss Cornelia. For a moment Elizabeth's
eyes rested, half absently perhaps, on the strong
lines of his face, while the irrelevant thought passed
through her mind: "I wonder what he would
think." Then, quick as lightning, the answer followed.
"I don't care," she said, under her breath,
and drew herself up with a little flash of defiance.

She turned towards Mrs. Bobby. "Do you really
want me?" she asked, caressingly.

"Should I have asked you, if I didn't," laughed
Mrs. Bobby, triumphant, as she saw that victory
was hers.

Elizabeth told the news to her aunts as soon as
the visitors had left. Their delight was what she
had expected. They were eager in approving her
decision, and in assuring her that she should have
all the pretty gowns that the occasion required, sustained
by the conviction, which occurred simultaneously
to the minds of both, that their old black
silks, which they had foolishly thought of as shabby,
would do admirably another winter. It would be
the height of extravagance, as Miss Cornelia afterwards
observed to replace them.

"It's just what we have always wished for you,"
she cried, her little curls all a'flutter with joyful
excitement, "and so unexpected&mdash;quite like a fairy-tale."
130

"Yes," Elizabeth assented, "quite like a fairy-tale.
There's only one difference," she added to
herself, as she left the room, "from every well-regulated
fairy-tale that I ever heard of. The fairy
Godmother, coach and four, are just a little&mdash;too
late."

Chapter XVI


"My dear Elizabeth," said Mrs. Bobby,
"I regret to say it, but you really
are growing terribly spoiled."

The winter was far advanced when Mrs. Bobby
made this remark. With Lent growing every day
nearer, the whirl of gaiety grew ever faster and
more furious. It was not often that Mrs. Bobby
and her guest had an opportunity for private conversation.
But to-night, as it happened, they had
merely been out to dinner, and having returned at
an unusually early hour, Elizabeth came into Mrs.
Bobby's boudoir in her long white dressing-gown,
and sat brushing out her masses of wavy hair, while
she and her hostess discussed the evening's entertainment,
and other recent events of interest.

Mrs. Bobby's eyes rested upon Elizabeth with all
the satisfaction with which a connoisseur regards
some beautiful object of which he has been the discoverer.
Elizabeth's beauty, Elizabeth's conquests,
formed to Mrs. Bobby just then a theme of which
she never tired. Nor did she fail to make them the
text for various sermons that she delivered to Bobby
about this time, on the subject of her own wisdom,
and his utter failure as a prophet.

"Confess, Bobby, that my plans turn out well,"
132
she would say, "and that I'm not such a fool as
you thought me."

"Why, I never," Bobby would protest, "thought
you anything of the kind." But she would go on
unheeding:

"It would have been a shame for that girl to be
buried in the country, and I do take some credit to
myself for having rescued her from such a fate.
But after that, all the credit is due to Elizabeth. I
did what I could, of course, to launch her successfully,
but when all is said and done, a girl has to
sink or swim on her own merits. Elizabeth takes
to society as a duck does to water; it's her natural
element. And talk of heredity! There are not
many girls with the most aristocratic mothers who
can come into a room with the air that she has, as
if she didn't care two straws whether any one spoke
to her or not, and then of course every one does.
Now explain to me, Bobby, if you can, where the
girl gets that air."

"I suppose," said Bobby, "if I believed implicitly
in heredity (which I am not at all sure that I do)
I'd account for it by your own remark that she has
plenty of good blood as well as bad."

"Oh, yes," said Mrs. Bobby, incredulously, "you
can always make a theory fit in somehow."

But though Mrs. Bobby exulted in that air of indifference
with which Elizabeth accepted, as if it
were a mere matter of course, all the devotion offered
up at her feet, she was beginning to realize that the
most admirable qualities can be carried too far. And
thus it was that she upbraided her this evening with
133
being unreasonably spoiled, and not sufficiently appreciating
the good things which had fallen to her
lot.

"I don't know what you want me to do," Elizabeth
said, quietly, when she had listened for some
moments to this rather vague accusation. "I'm
sure I go everywhere that I'm asked, and that, you
must admit, is saying a good deal; I talk to all the
men who talk to me, and that again you must admit,
means a great deal of conversational effort; and&mdash;and
I make no distinctions between them whatever,
and do my duty on all occasions. I really don't
know what more you can expect."

"But that," exclaimed her hostess, "is exactly
what I complain of. You go everywhere you are
asked&mdash;yes, and you never express a preference for
any particular place; you talk to the men who talk
to you, and you make no distinctions&mdash;no, for apparently
it's all the same to you, whether it's this
man or the other."

"Not quite," said Elizabeth, placidly, "for one
man amuses me and another doesn't. But beyond
that, I don't&mdash;thank Heaven! I don't care." She
broke off suddenly, and she drew her comb with
unwonted vehemence through her hair.

"I don't know why you should thank Heaven,"
said Mrs. Bobby, watching her narrowly, "for a
fact that is quite abnormal in a girl of your age,
who has some of the nicest men in town in love with
her. There are times when I think you are quite
heartless, and yet&mdash;with that hair, and those eyes,
and the way you throw yourself into your music,
134
you seem to have abundance of temperament. On
the whole, Elizabeth, you are a puzzling combination.
What was it Mr. D'Hauteville said of you&mdash;that
you reminded him of a lake of ice in a circle
of fire?"

"Mr. D'Hauteville," said Elizabeth, yawning,
"is fond of glittering similes. This one sounds well,
but doesn't bear close consideration. The fire, I
should think, under the circumstances, would dissolve
the ice."

"Perhaps it will," said Mrs. Bobby, "when the
right time comes."

"Which will be never," said Elizabeth, with decision.
Her hostess smiled as one who has heard
such things said before.

"After all," she resumed, after a pause, returning
to the grievance which had first started the conversation,
"I could forgive you everything else, but
this indifference about your picture. One would
think that when a great artist asks as a special favor
to paint your portrait, you might at least have the
decency to go to look at it, when it is on exhibition,
and all New York is talking about it."

"That's the very reason," said Elizabeth, "why
it strikes me as rather bad taste for me to stand in
rapt contemplation before it, while a lot of people
are jostling me, and making remarks about my eyes,
and hair, and mouth, as if it were I on exhibition,
and not Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s picture."

"Well, it is you whom they want to see," said
Mrs. Bobby. "The New York public doesn't care
135
much for art, but it does take an interest in the
people whom it reads about in the papers&mdash;a weakness
that we needn't quarrel with, since it has made
the Portrait Show a success, and given us so many
thousands for our hospital."

"Well, at least," said Elizabeth, "I have done
my duty in contributing my portrait to the good
cause; so don't ask me to be present in actual flesh
and blood, and above all not to face such a crowd
as there was the other day, when we tried to look
at it and my gown was nearly torn off my back in
the process."

"You could go early," suggested Mrs. Bobby,
"as I did the other day. You have no idea how
much better it looks in that light than it did at the
studio."

"I am very tired of it, in any light," said Elizabeth.
"People have talked to me so much about it.
But, if you insist upon it I will go&mdash;I will go early.
There are some of the other portraits too that I
should like to look at, if I can do so in peace." And
with this concession, the conversation was allowed
to drop for a moment.

It was Elizabeth who resumed it, speaking slowly
and tentatively, with many lapses, and eyes carefully
turned away from her friend. "You talk," she
said, "a great deal of my successes, and I suppose,
in a way, I ought to be&mdash;satisfied. And of course
I am," she added, hastily. "People have been very
nice to me. I&mdash;I couldn't ask for anything more.
And yet&mdash;there is one person&mdash;I don't know if you
136
have noticed it&mdash;one person with whom I am a distinct
failure, who I think almost dislikes me, and
that is&mdash;your friend Mr. Gerard."

"What, Julian," said Mrs. Bobby, in a tone that
was absolutely devoid of expression. "You think
he&mdash;doesn't like you?"

"I am quite sure of it," said Elizabeth.

"But why," questioned Mrs. Bobby, in apparent
bewilderment. "What reason have you for thinking
so?"

"A great many, but any one of them would be
enough. To begin with, he never speaks to me if
he can possibly help himself. His avoidance of me
is quite pointed&mdash;you surely must have noticed it?"
She fixed her eyes anxiously upon Mrs. Bobby.

"I"&mdash;Mrs. Bobby checked the impulsive words
that rose to her lips. "Julian is&mdash;is very peculiar,"
she said in a non-committal tone. "I don't think he
cares for women."

"Perhaps not; but still I have seen him talk to
them&mdash;in a bored sort of way, it is true. But to
me he never talks, in any way whatsoever."

"He never has a chance. You are always surrounded."

"He would have the same chance as the others.
No, it isn't that. He disapproves of me; I can feel
it, as he looks at me through those dark, half-shut
eyes of his, and it gives me an uncomfortable sense
of wickedness. He thinks me flippant, and vain,
and frivolous, and I am when he is there, or I seem
so. When he is listening, I say all the horrid, cynical,
heartless things I can think of. I have to say
137
them, somehow. It is fate. It began the first night
that I met him&mdash;it was in the country, do you remember?"
She paused and again looked questioningly
at Mrs. Bobby.

"Yes," the latter answered softly, "I remember."

"I was rather excited that night&mdash;it was the first
time I had ever been out to dinner. I talked in a
flippant sort of way about hating the country, and
longing to go out, and wanting to be always amused.
It was very young, I suppose." Elizabeth spoke
with all the superiority of a girl half-way through
her first season towards her more unsophisticated
self of a few months before. "He didn't like it.
The sort of woman whom he admires knows her
catechism, and is satisfied with that situation in life
where it has pleased Providence to place her. I
shocked him; he has never got over it. He showed
me, that very evening, how he disliked me&mdash;it was
so pointed that it was almost rude. You asked me&mdash;do
you remember? to play." She stopped.

"I remember," said Mrs. Bobby again softly.
"I never heard you play so well."

"I never have&mdash;since. I seemed to have, just for
the moment, some strange power over the keys&mdash;such
feelings come to one, you know, sometimes.
And then, when I stopped&mdash;he had asked me for
the Fire-music&mdash;I felt, somehow, that he was fond
of music&mdash;he is fond of it, passionately fond&mdash;but
when I stopped, he looked at me blankly for a moment,
till he suddenly remembered what was expected
of him, and thanked me in a cold sort of way
and walked off. And&mdash;I shouldn't think so much
138
of that; but since then he has never&mdash;never once
asked me to play, though he has often heard other
people ask me."

"I have noticed," said Mrs. Bobby, quietly, "that
you will never play when he is in the room."

"I couldn't," said Elizabeth, "it would have such
a dampening effect to feel that there was one person
in the room who disliked it, who, no matter
how well I played, would always preserve his critical
attitude.

"You see that I am reduced to the unflattering
alternative that it is myself that he objects to or my
playing. But it is the same with everything. There
is my picture, for instance. He is the only person
I know who has said nothing to me about it, has
probably not even seen it."

"That must be rather a relief," said Mrs. Bobby,
placidly, "since you are so tired of the subject."

"If I am," said Elizabeth, "that is no reason why
he shouldn't go through the conventional formula
of telling me that he has seen the picture, and adding
something civil about it, as the most ordinary
acquaintances never fail to do."

"No, of course," Mrs. Bobby agreed softly, "the
most ordinary acquaintances never would. But
perhaps he doesn't consider himself exactly that."

"Whatever he considers himself," said Elizabeth,
with some heat, "he is not exempt from the common
rules of civility. But I suppose he doesn't
really admire the picture, and is too painfully truthful
to pretend to the contrary." And then she
139
stopped and laughed a little at her own vehemence,
but without much spirit. "It really is very illogical,"
she admitted, "I don't care for Mr. Gerard's
admiration, it would probably bore me extremely
to have it; and yet&mdash;it's not pleasant to be so absolutely&mdash;ignored."

Mrs. Bobby was watching her with an odd little
gleam in the dark eyes that were almost hidden by
her long, curling lashes. "I will tell you," she
said, "what it is that he doesn't like. It isn't you,
or your playing, or your conversation; it's your
hair."

"My hair!" Elizabeth took up mechanically one
of her long shining locks and passed it through her
fingers. "I may have been inordinately vain," she
remarked after a pause, "but I never supposed before
that there was much the matter with my hair."

"Nor would most people, I imagine. But he has
some odd ideas, and among them, it seems, is a prejudice&mdash;a
superstition, as he calls it&mdash;against red
hair."

"But mine isn't red," said Elizabeth, quickly.

"Of course not," said Mrs. Bobby. "He is color
blind, as I told him. But there's no use in arguing
the point with him. He insists that your hair is
red enough to&mdash;to be dangerous&mdash;those are his
words, and he avoids you in consequence. He has
had some unfortunate experience in the past, I
should imagine, which has given him this prejudice.
There, my dear, I shouldn't have told you," Mrs.
Bobby went on, leaning back in her chair, and still
140
watching Elizabeth narrowly through half-closed
lids, "if I didn't know, of course, that it can make
no real difference to you what Julian thinks."

"Of course not," Elizabeth made answer mechanically
with dry lips, as she still drew her comb
absently through the offending hair.

"You have so many admirers," Mrs. Bobby continued
serenely, "it can't matter very much that one
person should hold aloof. And then I shouldn't
care about Julian's opinion, for he never admires
any woman. Ever since that unfortunate experience,
which happened, I think, when he was very
young, he has been a confirmed cynic, avoiding all
young girls, and horribly afraid of being married
for his money. I really despair now of his ever falling
in love; I have talked up almost every girl in
town to him, and all in vain. No, even you, Elizabeth,
spoiled as you are, couldn't expect to make a
conquest of Julian."

"I don't know what I should expect," said Elizabeth,
rather coldly, "but I certainly don't wish to.
It would hardly be worth while." She rose, with
one long look in the glass, and moved wearily towards
the door. "I am so very tired, dear," she
said. "I think I will say good-night."

"Good-night," said Mrs. Bobby, cheerfully.
"Sleep well&mdash;you need to&mdash;and don't waste another
thought on that tiresome creature, Julian."

"Oh, I'm not likely to," Elizabeth responded,
with rather a pale smile. "I'm much too tired."

And yet she did think of him more than once, as
141
she stood before her mirror, arranging her hair into
two heavy braids, which reached below her waist,
and repeating to herself that, as Mrs. Bobby had
said, it could matter little about the one dissenting
voice in the general chorus of admiration which had
attended her triumphant career. In spite of which
assurance, her last thoughts as she fell asleep might
have been somewhat surprising to those who,
having watched that career entirely from the outside,
regarded her as the most fortunate being in
the world.

Elizabeth's aunts were on the whole, more to be
envied than the girl herself that winter. There was
no alloy in their happiness, no under-current of dissatisfaction,
even though they wore their old black
silks, and Miss Joanna's friend, the butcher, was
heard to complain somewhat bitterly of her sudden
parsimony in regard to joints of meat. What did
it matter? They would have dressed cheerfully in
sackcloth and lived on bread and water, for the sake
of such glowing accounts of Elizabeth's triumphs
as Mrs. Bobby constantly transmitted, or of the
girl's own brilliant letters which seemed to breathe
the radiant satisfaction of a mind without a care.

Elizabeth's aunt at Bassett Mills also watched her
career, which was chronicled at that time in the
papers. Poor Aunt Rebecca, after a hard day's
work, reading her niece's name, and possibly a
description of her costume in the list of guests at
some smart festivity, would look up, awe-struck, at
Amanda. "Only to think," she would say, with
142
the old contradictory note, half pride, half jealousy
"to think that it should be Malvina's girl!"

But Amanda, still pale and wasted from the fever
with her hair quite long and very soft and wavy,
would give an odd, furtive look from her light eyes
and say nothing.


143

Chapter XVII


It was early at the Portrait Show. It was so
early that what few people were already
there had the place practically to themselves.
There were only three or four in the large room at
the head of the stairs, which at a later hour of the
afternoon was invariably crowded, and where was
hung that picture which had attracted so much attention,
partly from the great fame of the artist,
still more, perhaps, from the beauty of the subject.

A young girl in a long, white gown of some soft,
clinging stuff, stood against the background of
a dark green velvet curtain. There was no relief
to the dead whiteness of the gown, and the roses
that she held were white; all that brilliancy of color,
for which this great artist is famous, he had expended
upon the deep red-gold tints of the hair,
the vivid scarlet of the lips, the warm creamy tones
of the skin, as they were thrown into full relief by
the dark background. The painter had lingered,
with all the skill at his command, on the rounded,
dimpled curves of the neck and arms, nor had he
forgotten the haughty little turn of the head, which
gave a characteristic touch to the picture. Seen at
a glance, it was aglow with life and color, very
human, very mundane, the embodiment of health
144
and bloom. A study in flesh-tints, one critic had
carelessly pronounced it, and nothing more. It was
only when you looked at the eyes that you caught
a discordant note, which, if you dwelt upon it,
contradicted the joyous effect of the rest; a look,
a latent shadow which the great artist had either
surprised or imagined, and transferred perhaps unconsciously
to his canvas, where, if you saw it at
all, it held you with a haunting sense of mystery,
the fascination of an unsolved problem. "What
does it mean," a man said to himself that afternoon,
"and did &mdash;&mdash; really put it in, or do I,
with my usual superstition, imagine it? Am I the
only person who sees it, or do others?"

Two young girls, who jostled up against him just
then evidently did not.

"Portrait of Miss Van Vorst," said one, reading
from her catalogue, "by &mdash;&mdash;." She passed
the artist's name without recognition, as she delightedly
pressed her companion's arm. "Say, Mamie,
that's Elizabeth Van Vorst, you know, the beauty.
I've seen lots about her in the papers."

"You don't say so?" returned the other, who
was apparently less up-to-date. "I thought she
must be one of the swells, but I didn't know the
name. She's pretty isn't she?&mdash;but doesn't her nose
turn up too much?&mdash;and I don't think much of her
dress, it's so kind of simple."

The man who had been standing when they came
up in front of the picture, turned frowning aside,
and found himself face to face with the original.
For an instant each stared at the other in silence,
145
and it might have been noticed by a careful observer
that the man was at once the more disconcerted and
the less surprised of the two.

"So I see you have achieved fame," he said, recovering
himself almost immediately and smiling,
as he glanced at the two girls who were still criticizing
Elizabeth's features, all unconscious that the
subject of their remarks was within hearing.

"Yes, fame," she returned, lightly "of a kind
that you despise." She, too, was quite herself again&mdash;that
flippant, frivolous self, at least, which he
had always the power to awaken.

"I suppose I'm a crank," he admitted. "I really
don't like to hear my friends talked about, by their
first name by people who have read about them in
the papers."

"Oh, that," she said, carelessly "is a necessary
penalty of fame."

"Which you share with a variety actress," he returned.
"I realize more and more that I'm hopelessly
behind the age. Look at those two girls,"
he went on, glancing at them with some animosity.

"They have spent, I should imagine, their little
all on the admission fee and the catalogue; they
don't care two straws for the portraits as portraits,
and they have never spoken to the originals, but
they are wildly interested in them because they
represent to them the magic word 'society,' and
they will go away and talk about them as if they
knew them intimately."

Elizabeth laughed softly. "Ah," she said "let
them be. They're getting their money's worth;
146
don't grudge it to them. So far as I'm concerned,
they may pull my face to pieces as much as they
please. I know how it is&mdash;I've stood on the outside,
too, of a thing, and tried to imagine that I
was in it."

"Do you think they'd be happier," asked Gerard,
"if they were?"

"Ah, that depends," she returned, oracularly,
stroking down the long fur of her muff.

"Tell me how you find it yourself," said Gerard.
He looked about the room. "The place is
comfortably empty," he said. "Have you been
around yet, or would you&mdash;a&mdash;like to sit down
awhile?"

She hesitated. "I have been in several of the
rooms," she said. "I came early on purpose.
Eleanor is lunching somewhere, but she is to meet
me here at three."

"Then suppose you&mdash;a&mdash;rest till she comes?"
he suggested, as he led the way to a sofa which had
been placed for the accommodation of weary sight-seers
in the centre of the room. "It's a long while
since I've had a talk with you. ('And whose fault
is that,' thought Elizabeth.) This isn't a bad place
to talk in, and if you've been around once, you've
had enough of it for the time being."

"I am glad to rest for a few minutes," Elizabeth
admitted.

She threw open the revers of her coat, and sank
back in her seat as if physically tired. Gerard
looked at her. She was exquisitely dressed. Her
dark green velvet and furs set off the fairness of
147
her skin, her large feathered hat suited her picturesque
style. The subtle atmosphere of fashion,
of distinction, lurked in every fold of her gown, in
every movement and gesture. Three months had
sufficed to endow her with it. They had also sufficed&mdash;or
was this again the result of his imagination?&mdash;to
take away the first freshness of her
beauty. She looked brilliant, but a trifle worn; her
color had faded, there were lines of weariness about
the mouth, and deep black rings under the eyes.

"You don't look well," he said, abruptly. She
smiled. ("I might have known that he would say
that," she said to herself.)

"I know it," she returned, quietly. "The maid
woke me up, as she generally does, with strong
coffee. I refused at first to be waked. I haven't
been to bed at a reasonable hour for weeks, and I'm
so countrified that I show the ill effects of it."

"You shouldn't go out so much," said Gerard.
"What is Eleanor thinking of that she allows it?
You&mdash;you will be ill if this keeps up." He spoke
almost angrily.

"Yet what difference would it make to him?"
thought Elizabeth. "He is very unaccountable.
Why should he look at my picture, thinking no
doubt all the time how ugly my hair is? I don't
want his advice&mdash;I won't have it. Oh, it's all in a
good cause," she said lightly, aloud. "I complain
sometimes, but I wouldn't stay at home, really, for
the world. It's all too delightful. I may be tired,
but at least I'm not bored."

"It has all come up to your expectations, then?"
148
said Gerard. "You like it better than&mdash;a&mdash;the river
view?"

"Ah, if you had looked at that view as many
years as I have, you wouldn't need to ask the
question."

"And you are always amused?" he went on.
"That was the next wish, wasn't it? You see I'm
putting you through the category, as I threatened
to do once, and I expect only the truth for an answer.
Are you always, every day and all day long,
thoroughly amused?"

She met his gaze unflinchingly. "Don't I&mdash;seem
to be?" she asked.

"I don't know," he said. "I've wondered&mdash;sometimes.
You certainly ought to be," he declared.

"Then," she said "you may take it for granted
that I am."

"And the third wish," he said, musingly, "follows
naturally on the other. You never, in this
whirl of gaiety&mdash;never, I suppose, get a chance to
think?"

"Not a moment," she returned, triumphantly.
"All my time is occupied, I'm glad to say, in being
amused. That's hard work, too, sometimes, but then&mdash;the
game is worth the candle."

"Well," he said "you are, I admit, a very fortunate
young woman, and you have my congratulations.
There are not many people whose wishes
are fulfilled, as quickly and absolutely as yours have
been."

"No," she said, with sudden thoughtfulness
149
"that is very true." She sat for a moment staring
straight before her, with the look in her eyes which
had puzzled and haunted him in the pictured eyes
at which he had looked awhile before. "Do you
know," she said at last, speaking very low and hesitatingly,
"it's very absurd, but it&mdash;sometimes it
frightens me a little. Do you remember in Greek
history&mdash;or was it mythology?&mdash;there was a king
who had every wish fulfilled, till he grew at last
to feel that it&mdash;was dangerous; he offered up sacrifices
to the gods, he tried to escape but it was all
of no use. Everything went well with him, till at
last&mdash;his fate overtook him. And so I think, sometimes&mdash;mine
will."

"Your fate?" Gerard repeated, utterly taken
aback and puzzled.

"Yes, the penalty," she said, quickly "of having
too much. I have an odd idea sometimes that there
is&mdash;there must be some misfortune in store for me;
that I shall pay for all this yet in some terrible way
which no one expects. Oh, it's perfectly absurd, I
know, but still I&mdash;I can't help it." She had turned
of a sudden very white, and she stared up at Gerard
with a frightened, mute appeal in her eyes, like that
of some dumb animal or a child.

To him she seemed all at once very young and
helpless, a being to be soothed and protected; very
different from the gay, self-possessed young woman
of a few minutes before. "My dear child," he said,
very gently, yet with a note of authority, and laying
his hand ever so lightly on the delicately gloved
hand that rested on her muff "you're nervous and
150
over-wrought. You couldn't otherwise have such a
morbid idea. This eternal going-out has got on
your nerves. I wish you would promise me to stay
at home for a day or two. You will, won't you?"
he asked, persuasively.

"Yes, I&mdash;I will," she said, mechanically, and still
looking very white. "I'm over-tired, as you say."

"And now don't talk," he went on, peremptorily.
"I'll get you a glass of water, and then I want you
to sit quietly here, and not say a word, till you
are better."

She shook her head. "I'm quite well, and I don't
want anything," she protested, but he brought the
glass of water and made her drink it, and then
watched her anxiously, while the color slowly came
back to her face, and her eyes lost their strained,
appealing look. They sat in silence; he would not
let her speak, and as time passed, a great calm insensibly
stole over her, a feeling of peace, of security,
such as she had not known in all those weeks of
fevered gaiety. She was conscious vaguely of a
wish that she might sit thus always, saying nothing,
alone with him&mdash;all the more alone as it seemed for
the crowd that was beginning to surge into the
room, with a murmur that broke faintly upon her
ear, like the sound of the sea a long way off.

The wish was, perhaps, the result of fatigue.
She was no sooner fully conscious of it than she
rose to her feet.

"Shall we walk through the rooms now?" she
said. "It's more than time for Eleanor to be here.
Oh, I'm all right now, thank you"&mdash;she met his
151
question smilingly. "I don't know what was the
matter&mdash;it was very silly. You see I boasted unwisely
about never thinking, since I have such foolish
thoughts; but I won't again. Look, there is a
picture of Gertrude Trevor. A good likeness, isn't
it? But you've seen it before, perhaps?"

"No," said Gerard, absently. "I haven't seen any
of them before." They walked on slowly through
the rooms, and she did the honors, pointing out the
pictures, as it was apparently his first visit. They
did not seem to interest him greatly.

"Have you really never been here before?" she
asked at length. She could not have explained
what induced her to put the question.

He answered it absently. "Why, yes, every day"&mdash;and
then suddenly stopped and turned his eyes
full upon her, while that strange light gleamed in
their sombre depths which she had surprised once
or twice before and had interpreted many different
ways, which now set her heart beating wildly, and
made her wish her question unspoken. "Every
day," he repeated, quietly, "about this time, or
earlier, since&mdash;since the thing began."

"Then why&mdash;why"&mdash;The words died away on
her lips. They had reached the head of the great
staircase, and the crowd came streaming up, a confused
mass, to which she paid no heed. She had
again the feeling of being alone, quite alone, in the
midst of it all, while involuntarily their eyes met,
and his were all aglow with a fire which she had
never before seen in them, or imagined; a fire that
dazzled and bewildered, and filled her with a
152
strange, unreasoning joy, as it burned away the
barriers of doubt and indifference, till for one short,
breathless moment, which she could have counted
with her heart-beats she read his inmost soul.

"I only looked at one picture," he said.

And then with the words the spell which held
her seemed broken, and the crowd closed in about
her, with a sound like the roar of the sea very near
at hand, and she looked down the great staircase,
and saw Mrs. Bobby coming towards them.


153

Chapter XVIII


"My dear," said Mrs. Bobby, "I'm so
sorry to be late. Luncheon was interminable.
Why, Julian, who
would have expected to see you here?" She gave
him her hand demurely, with softly shining eyes.
Neither her surprise nor her contrition seemed to
ring quite true.

Gerard's dark eyes were again half closed beneath
their heavy lids. He looked, if a trifle pale,
more impassive than usual.

"I don't know why my presence here should
cause so much surprise," he said. "Most people
come here, don't they, some time or another. It's
a&mdash;a meeting-place, isn't it?"

"It seems to have been on this occasion," Mrs.
Bobby murmured under her breath. A young man
had just stopped and spoken to Elizabeth, and the
words might have referred to him. Gerard smiled.

"Won't you come and look at some of these pictures?"
he asked. "I want to talk to you."

"You awaken my curiosity."

They walked slowly along the gallery which
skirted the hall, too deep in conversation to pay
much heed to the pictures which hung along their
way. Elizabeth's eyes followed them, the while
154
she was repeating mechanically "Yes, the portraits
are extremely fine."

"But not one," the young man declared, with
blunt gallantry "to compare with yours. It's by all
odds the most beautiful picture here."

"Do you really think so?" said Elizabeth, gently.
"I'm very glad." She had heard the sentiment,
rather differently put, perhaps a hundred times. Yet
it seemed now to have all the charm of novelty.

The young man, a very slight acquaintance,
charmed to have called up that glow of pleasure to
her face, redoubled his efforts to entertain her. He
was sorry when Mrs. Bobby returned with Gerard,
and bore her off. "She was delighted when I said
that about her picture," he thought, "there's nothing
like flattering a girl, if you know how to do it
delicately."

"We really must be going, Elizabeth," said Mrs.
Bobby, consulting her engagement-book. "We have
at least a dozen visits, and we promised, you know,
to go to Mr. D'Hauteville's musicale."

"That reminds me that I did too," said Gerard.
"I'm glad you spoke of it."

"We shall see you there, then," said Mrs. Bobby,
as he placed them in the carriage, and they drove
off. "I am feeling utterly crushed," she continued,
turning to Elizabeth, and looking under the circumstances,
very cheerful. "Julian has been giving me
a terrible lecture. He thinks me, I see very clearly,
quite unfit to have the care of you. He says that
you are not as strong as you seem, that I have been
dragging you around&mdash;entirely for my own pleasure,
155
apparently&mdash;from one thing to another till you
are quite worn out, and that you will be ill if
I don't take care. He has quite frightened me.
But there, Elizabeth, you don't look so very tired,
after all."

She certainly did not. There was color in her
cheeks, a light in her eyes that was at once brilliant
and soft. All the lines drawn by sleepless nights
had, for the moment at least, disappeared.

"You don't look badly," Mrs. Bobby repeated.
"You look, in fact, infinitely better than when I
saw you this morning."

"I feel better," Elizabeth admitted. "Just for
a moment, at the Portrait Show, I did feel tired and
depressed, and he&mdash;Mr. Gerard got alarmed about
me, but it was nothing. I am quite well now. And
the portraits are really very interesting. I am glad
you persuaded me to look at them again, Eleanor."

"I thought you might be repaid," said Mrs.
Bobby, serenely. "What did you think of your
own picture? Doesn't it look better in that light?"

Elizabeth's face was turned away, so that Mrs.
Bobby could only see the rounded outline of her
cheek and one small, shell-like ear. "Yes, I&mdash;I
thought it looked better," she said, in a low voice.
"Perhaps you were right. It must have been the&mdash;the
light of the studio that made me feel&mdash;disappointed
in it, somehow."

"Oh, there is everything in the light in which
you look at things," assented Mrs. Bobby, cheerfully.
And with this profound remark, the two women
sank into silence, while the carriage rolled swiftly
156
up the Avenue, stopping occasionally, as the footman
left cards. To Elizabeth, as she sat gazing out
of the window, the prosaic brown stone houses, and
the more pretentious ones of marble which broke
the monotony here and there, and the brilliant
shops, which had intruded themselves like parvenus
among their quieter and more aristocratic neighbors&mdash;all
these familiar objects stood out in a softened
perspective, which endowed them with lines almost
of romance. The wide, commonplace streets had
an unwonted charm, the people who walked on them
wore an air of curious happiness, merely, no doubt,
at finding themselves alive in this beautiful world.
Yes, as Mrs. Bobby had so wisely observed, "there
is everything in the light in which you look at
things."

"I wonder if Mr. D'Hauteville's musicale will be
pleasant," Elizabeth observed dreamily, as they
neared Carnegie Hall. The remark was purely perfunctory.
Pleasant? Of course it would be pleasant&mdash;she
hadn't a doubt of it.

"There will be a lot of queer people there&mdash;musical,
literary, and that sort of thing," said Mrs.
Bobby, vaguely. "Some men with long hair will
play, and the women, no doubt, will wear wonderful
æsthetic gowns. If Julian were not to be there, I
should not dream of going. My prophetic instinct
tells me that we shall not know a soul."

"But won't that be rather amusing," suggested
Elizabeth.

"Well, theoretically, yes," said Mrs. Bobby, in
rather a doubtful tone, "but, practically, I'm afraid
157
I prefer people whom I know, and who have the
conventional amount of hair and lack of brains. Let
me confess the truth to you, Elizabeth. I'm not
really Bohemian&mdash;I only pretend to be so at odd
moments, when I want to tease Bobby, or shock
the Neighborhood. There isn't at heart, I believe,
a more conventional little society wretch than
I. However, as you say, that sort of thing is
amusing&mdash;for one afternoon; and Julian will be
there, and protect us from the celebrities and tell us
who they all are."

Julian was fortunately on hand when they arrived,
but the room was filled for the most part
with people who looked very much like any one else,
and only a few were sufficiently long-haired and
eccentric to justify Mrs. Bobby's prediction of their
being celebrities of some sort. The host, who came
forward to meet them, was a well-known musician,
a man with an intellectual face and dreamy eyes,
which lighted up as he welcomed them with eager
cordiality; but he could do no more for the present
than seat them and give them programmes, for the
music was about to begin.

It was a charming studio, well up near the top
of Carnegie Hall, and like most studios, it was artistically
furnished. The polished floor was strewn
with rich rugs, the walls were covered in every
nook and cranny, with plaques, and pictures, and
rare tapestries, and strange Eastern weapons. A
grand piano took up the whole of one corner, and
in another a toy staircase seemed to have been
placed entirely for ornament, till it was utilized as a
158
seat by some picturesque-looking girls in large hats.
From the broad casemented window near which
Elizabeth sat, she could see an expanse of roofs and
chimneys, far down from the dizzy height, and beyond
them the river, and further still the winter
sunset, fading in cold blues and greens and violets,
on a still colder sky. Her eyes rested there with
dreamy satisfaction. She had no wish to look back
into the room, to where Gerard was standing close
to them, on the other side of Mrs. Bobby. She was
still living on the memory of that moment&mdash;was it
an hour or was it years ago?&mdash;that long look of
which the reflected light was still glowing on her
face, and in her dreamy eyes. She had no wish to
renew it; the recollection was sufficient, for awhile
at least. Yet she was glad to know that he was
there.

Mrs. Bobby meanwhile, having embarked on her
trip to Bohemia, was disappointed to find it comparatively
tame.

"I don't see any one I know," she said to Gerard,
as the piano solo came to an end. "They look, most
of them, depressingly commonplace. But they must
be extraordinary in some way, or they wouldn't be
here. Tell us who they are, Julian, and introduce
them to us if you think we would like them."

"Why, there are some musical lights," he answered,
rather absently "who, I hope, are going to
perform for our benefit, and there are a few ordinary
music-lovers like myself, and some literary people&mdash;whom
I don't know that you would care
about."
159

"You think us too frivolous, I see," said Mrs.
Bobby. "But you don't realize how clever I can
be if I try, and as for Elizabeth, she knows a
lot more than she seems to know."

"Does she?" asked Gerard with a smile, and he
glanced across at Elizabeth, who still would not
meet his eyes. "She looks very innocent," he said,
musingly, after a pause. "I should be sorry to
think of her as&mdash;concealing anything."

A little pang, a thought sharp like a stone, struck
Elizabeth for an instant. It was the first rift in
the lute. She put it resolutely away from her.

"You think me too stupid, I see," she said "to
have any knowledge to conceal."

He had no time to answer before some woman
began to sing. She had a beautiful voice, and Elizabeth
listened, yet chiefly conscious, all the while, of
the fact that Gerard had managed to shift his position,
and was standing directly behind her.

"I never thought you stupid," he said, under
cover of the applause, in a low voice that no one
but she could hear, "no, nor ignorant; but I have
sometimes thought you frivolous, and flippant, and&mdash;and
a little hard. You seem, I sometimes think,
to take pleasure in showing these qualities to me.
Why is it, I wonder?"

"I&mdash;I don't know," she murmured, in the same
low voice, and gazing straight before her. "You&mdash;somehow
you seem to compel it. You ought to
be grateful, I think. At least you know the worst
of me."

She spoke these words with an absolute unconsciousness
160
of their falseness; and even as they died
away on her lips, she glanced across the room and
saw Paul Halleck standing in the door-way.

That old mythological king whom some vague
reminiscence of her school-days had conjured up
in Elizabeth's mind, he who had every wish fulfilled,
till he grew at last to dread his own prosperity&mdash;was
it, I wonder, in some such moment of
foreboding that the final crash came, or was it when
his fears were lulled and his senses stilled, by some
delicious, over-powering sense of happiness that
shut out for the moment all unpleasant thoughts?
This, at all events, was the way in which fate overtook
Elizabeth.

Paul Halleck stood in the door-way, having apparently
just arrived. His blue eyes were wandering
about the room. They did not fall, as yet,
upon Elizabeth.

She did not faint, or cry out, or make herself in
any way conspicuous. She turned deathly white,
and her heart, which had been beating faster for
Gerard's presence, seemed suddenly to stop entirely,
as though a piece of ice had been laid on it. And
then, in a moment, her heart began to beat again,
though faintly. She drew a long breath. Gerard,
who was standing directly behind her, could not
see her face beneath the shadow of her large hat,
yet he felt instinctively that something was wrong.

"Do you feel faint again?" he asked, anxiously,
thinking to himself that she was really far from well.
"Can I get you anything?"

"No, thank you," said Elizabeth. "I felt faint
161
for a moment, but it is over." It took all the
strength that she possessed to speak these words
so clearly and distinctly. In making the effort she
was not conscious of any plan of deception. She
was merely bearing up, instinctively, to the end.

She never doubted that it was the end. It had
fallen at last&mdash;that sword of Damocles, which she
had learned to dread as the winter wore on, of
which she had always been vaguely conscious even
in her gayest moments, and had only forgotten, quite
forgotten, in that short, delicious hour when she
had allowed herself to float off in a dream of happiness
never to be realized, from which she was awakened
so soon and so rudely. And yet, though it
was over, she was not sorry that she had dreamed
it. It had been very sweet, worth even, she thought,
the bitterness of the awakening.

Meanwhile the musicale progressed. A man with
long, floating hair and fingers of steel thundered
out a piano solo. Elizabeth shut her eyes and leaned
back in her chair. How fortunate that there was
so much music to prevent conversation! But at the
first pause she opened her eyes and looked up at
Gerard.

"I was wrong when I told you that you know
the worst of me," she said, faintly. "You'll know
it, soon."

"What a terrible prospect!" said Gerard, bending
over her and the jesting words had a soft intonation,
which thrilled her like a caress. "I really
don't think I can stand it&mdash;quite."

Had she intended to tell him the truth? The moment
162
was not propitious. The music had stopped,
and there was a murmur of conversation all over
the room. People began to move about, and in the
general shifting of position, Paul Halleck, for the
first time, caught sight of Elizabeth.

She had had some vague, childish idea of what
would happen when he saw her. She had pictured
him in her unreasoning terror, as stepping forward
before them all and claiming her as his wife, like
a scene in a play. Nothing of the kind took place.
She saw at once how absurd her expectations had
been. Paul merely started and looked at her, recognition
and it seemed, pleasure sparkling in his
eyes; but with a sudden, uncontrollable impulse, she
turned her own eyes away, as if she did not know
him.

"Do you see that man in the door-way?" said
Gerard, who, standing as he was behind her could
not note the changes in her face,&mdash;"that handsome
fellow with the light curls? He has a very
fine voice, and has just been engaged as soloist at
St. Chrysostom's."

"Indeed. Is he to sing this afternoon?" She
brought out the question with difficulty.

"I hope so," said Gerard. "I'd like you to hear
him. But perhaps you know him," he went on.
"He is looking at you as if he expected you to
bow."

"No," said Elizabeth. "I don't know him." She
told him this, her second lie that afternoon, without
deliberate intention, in sheer lack of presence of
mind. It was a piteous, involuntary staving-off of
163
the inevitable. The next moment that fascination
which leads us to our own undoing made her look in
Paul's direction, and this time she could not avoid
his eager gaze and bent her head mechanically.

"After all, I believe I must have met him somewhere,"
she said hastily. Mrs. Bobby, who for the
last quarter of an hour, had been determinedly ignoring
them both, apparently giving her whole attention
to the music and the people, now turned
towards them.

"Who is that handsome man who bowed to you,
Elizabeth?" she asked. "I never saw him before."

"His name is Halleck. I&mdash;I knew him in the
country," said Elizabeth, who had no natural talent
for deception and entangled herself at once in contradictory
statements. Gerard's face darkened, and
he glanced across at Halleck, whose eyes were fixed
on Elizabeth with a look that seemed, to the jealous,
fastidious man by her side, an intolerable presumption;
a look that was not only one of admiration,
but, or Gerard imagined so, held in it a curious
touch of proprietorship. "Confound the fellow,"
chafed Gerard&mdash;he who would fain have kept the
woman he loved, as he certainly would have kept her
picture, shut out from all profane eyes, even admiring
ones. "He looks at her as if he had discovered
her and she belonged to him. Where can she have
met him, and why did she say she hadn't."

Mrs. Bobby, too, looked across at Paul.

"He is certainly very good-looking," she said.
"And do you mean to tell me, my dear, that such
an Adonis flourished in our Neighborhood, and I
164
never saw him. Pray, where did you keep him
hidden?"

Before Elizabeth could reply, and to her great
relief, D'Hauteville came up with the long-haired
musician, whom he introduced to them, and who
proved to be, at last, one of the celebrities upon
whom Mrs. Bobby had counted. In the diversion
that ensued Halleck seemed forgotten. But a few
minutes later, he sat at the piano and sang songs by
Schubert and Franz, which she had heard him sing
before, at the time when she had thought his voice
the most beautiful voice in the world. Now, as she
listened it left her cold. She had changed so much,
and he&mdash;no, he had not changed. His voice was
not so wonderful as she had thought it, but still it
was a fine barytone voice. His art no longer seemed
to her remarkable, but it had, if anything, improved,
and he was as handsome as ever, in his fair,
effeminate style. It was not the voice nor the art
that was lacking. It was the answering thrill in
herself. It was not his beauty which had failed
him, it was she who no longer cared for it.

His success with the audience was instantaneous.
Even Mrs. Bobby was impressed. "Your friend
sings well," she whispered to Elizabeth, "and yet
his hair is short. You may introduce him to me if
you get a chance."

And this chance immediately presented itself, as
Paul, amid the applause that followed his song,
walked over to Elizabeth and quietly shook hands
with her. It was the moment that she had dreaded
all the time that he was singing, yet now that it
165
had come, she met it in apparent unconcern, and
smiling, though with white lips.

"I thought at first," Paul said, "that you had
quite forgotten me."

"Oh, no," she said, "my memory is not so
short." Then she turned and introduced him to Mrs.
Bobby, and went on herself quietly talking to Mr.
D'Hauteville. Nothing could have been more simple.
Not even Julian Gerard, who from a distance
watched their meeting, could have imagined any
secret understanding between them.

The handsome young singer made a very favorable
impression upon Mrs. Bobby, who went so far
as to ask him to call, in that impulsive way of hers,
which sometimes led to consequences that she regretted.
In this case she realized, almost as soon as
the words had left her lips, that she had done a
rash thing, or what Bobby would consider rash.
Still, the invitation was given and eagerly accepted,
even though Elizabeth, standing cold and indifferent,
said not a word to second it. By this time the music
was over. They were about to leave, when some one
claimed Mrs. Bobby's attention, and she turned
aside for a moment. Paul seized the opportunity,
for which he had been anxiously waiting, to whisper
in Elizabeth's ear.

"Darling, don't go. I must see you for a moment."

"You can't speak to me here," she said, impatiently,
trying to escape from him.

"But I must see you. Can't you see that I
must?"
166

"You have done without it," said Elizabeth, without
turning her head, "some time."

"Because I couldn't help myself."

"There is such a thing as writing," she said, in
the same low, bitter tone. Yet even as she spoke
her conscience misgave her. It was not his neglect
that she resented so bitterly, it was his return. But
Paul, not understanding this was rather flattered
than otherwise by the reproach.

"Darling, I will explain when I see you," he said,
hurriedly. "There's no time now. Meet me to-morrow
morning&mdash;at the Fifty-ninth street entrance
to the Park, at eleven o'clock."

"To-morrow! Impossible! I have a hundred
things to do."

"Ah, but you must," he pleaded. "I must see
you. Darling you look so beautiful&mdash;fifty times
more beautiful than before."

"Hush," said Elizabeth. "How dare you? Some
one will hear you."

"Give me a chance of seeing you, then," he said.
"It is necessary. You will meet me&mdash;will you
not?&mdash;to-morrow morning?"

"If you insist upon it&mdash;yes."

"At the west entrance of the Park&mdash;you understand?"

"Oh, yes," said Elizabeth impatiently, and hastened
to rejoin Mrs. Bobby, who was waiting at
the door.

Julian Gerard came up gloomily. The whispered
conference had not escaped his notice.

"We shall see you to-night at the Lansdownes'
167
ball," said Mrs. Bobby. "It is the night for it, isn't
it, Elizabeth? I never can keep track of these
things."

Gerard looked reproachfully at Elizabeth. "You
promised me," he said, "that you would stay at
home for a night or two."

She smiled back at him with the old touch of
wilfulness. "Did I really make such a rash promise,"
she said, lightly. "Ah, I'm afraid I can't keep
it&mdash;not to-night. I must be amused. A quiet evening
would be unendurable." Her cheeks were
flushed, her eyes glittered with feverish gaiety,
there was an odd, strained note in her voice. Mrs.
Bobby looked at her in some perplexity, then she
glanced up deprecatingly at Gerard.

"It is her first season, you see Julian," she said,
as if in apology. "You can't expect her to give up
things."

"No," he repeated, mechanically. "I can't expect
her to&mdash;give up things." He fell back silently,
in increased gloom. Elizabeth glanced towards him
involuntarily as she left the room.

"Now," she said to herself, "I have disappointed
him again and he won't come near me this evening.
But it is better so&mdash;far, far better," she repeated to
herself, with a little sob, as she followed her hostess
to the carriage.


168

Chapter XIX


The next day was unexpectedly mild. Winter,
after reigning supreme, made sudden
and treacherous overtures to approaching
spring. The air in the Park was almost balmy, and
the drives were gay, as though it were much later
in the season, with carriages and riders and bicycles
galore; yet the warm sunlight falling incongruously
on sere, brown grass and bare branches, seemed but
to emphasize their dreariness and the fact that winter
had not really surrendered, and was only biding his
time and the advent of the March winds, to make
his power felt all the more strongly. Pedestrians,
realizing this, refused to be inveigled out, even by
the spring-like air, and there was no one to notice
the young man and the young woman who sat on a
bench in one of the secluded walks near Eighth
avenue; the young woman, simply dressed in a dark
tailor-made gown, with a small black hat pushed
well over her face, which showed beneath it very
pale and set, with hard lines about the mouth; the
young man staring at her in bewilderment, a look of
distress in his handsome blue eyes.

"And so," he said, "you don't love me any
longer?" It had taken him some time to grasp this
fact, which still seemed to him incomprehensible.
169

"No," she said, in a low, determined voice, "I
don't love you any longer. I don't know if I&mdash;ever
did. I was so young, I had never seen any
men, I didn't know what I was doing. You flattered
me; it was interesting, romantic. But if I had loved
you, really loved you"&mdash;she stopped for an instant.
"If I had really loved you," she repeated "do you
think I could have hesitated&mdash;that day at Cranston?
Do you think I could have let you go&mdash;without me?
Why, I should have followed you&mdash;don't you see
that I would?&mdash;to the end of the world." The color
rushed into her face, there was a ring in her voice
that he never heard before&mdash;no, not even in those
early days, when she had sat at his feet, and worshipped
him as a genius. Then, as he looked at
her, he realized for the first time that he had lost
her. The discovery was, for many reasons, unwelcome.

"Well, if you didn't love me," he said, hoarsely,
"you certainly made me believe that you did. Elizabeth,
you have treated me abominably. I didn't
wish to leave you&mdash;do me the justice to admit that&mdash;it
was your own doing entirely."

"I know it." She bent her head submissively.
"I don't blame you for anything; not even for&mdash;forgetting
me."

"I didn't forget you," he interrupted her, flushing
hotly, and repeating assertions which she had
heard already, and interpreted by that knowledge
of his character, which she had acquired too late
to be of value. She put them aside now with a
gesture of weariness.
170

"What's the use," she said, "of going over that
again, I have said already, I don't reproach you.
We can't either of us&mdash;can we?&mdash;afford to throw
stones. And yet, if you had not stopped writing"&mdash;She
paused for a moment with knitted brows, as
she seemed to weigh one possibility against another,
in a sort of inward trial of her own conduct. An
instinctive mental honesty, however, carried the day.
"I don't know that that would have made any difference,"
she said. "I was very unhappy because
you&mdash;had forgotten me, and that made me want to
come to town, all the more; but&mdash;if I had been happy,
and sure that you loved me, I should have come, I
think, all the same. And no matter how I had felt,
or what I had done, I should have known, sooner
or later&mdash;oh, I couldn't but realize it&mdash;what a&mdash;what
a terrible mistake we had made." She put out
her hands in a sudden, despairing gesture, which
hurt his vanity.

"Elizabeth, do you really mean that?"

"Yes," she said, in a low, monotonous voice, and
staring straight before her with hard, hopeless eyes.
"Yes, I mean it. I have been realizing it, little
by little, all these months. And yet I put it away&mdash;I
wouldn't think of it&mdash;till one day it forced
itself upon me. I knew, all at once, that I&mdash;I
dreaded your coming back, I hoped you never
would&mdash;it was when I was enjoying myself, when I
was thinking how delightful life was. And then,
after that, the fear of your coming was always there&mdash;I
could never get rid of it for any length of time,
till just for a while&mdash;yesterday"&mdash;Her voice faltered,
171
and for the first time the softening tears
sprang to her eyes. "Oh, I can't help it," she cried
out, "if I'm hard. When I think how happy I
was&mdash;wildly, absurdly happy, just for a little while,
and then to think how&mdash;how miserable I am now."

She stopped, half strangled with her sobs, and
Paul sat staring at her in moody silence. He was
clear-sighted enough now to grasp the truth. Such
violent grief, he told himself, could have but one
explanation. There was, there must be, some other
man.

Yet the conviction made him only the more determined
not to give her up. True, there had been
a time, not long before, when he would have done
so only too gladly; when he would have welcomed
an opportunity to free himself from an irksome
bond, which he regretted quite as much as she did.
But now, since his return, when he heard her spoken
of everywhere as one of the beauties of the season,
when he saw her in D'Hauteville's studio in her velvet
and furs, her whole appearance redolent of
grace and charm, and that nameless distinction
which Gerard had noticed, and which impressed the
young musician even more deeply; when he saw
her thus a hundred times more desirable, his fickle
heart succumbed anew, with a sudden throb of joy,
at the thought of the secret tie between them. She
was his, this young princess, whom he had chosen
when she was a mere Cinderella; he had but to hold
out his hand and she would come to him. For he
never doubted that she would come. Her first coldness
he had looked upon as mere girlish pique at
172
his neglect, a proof of her affection. Now, a
sadder and a wiser being, he had learned that the
privilege of forgetfulness is not confined to men
alone.

Yet the situation, unflattering though it was, had
its advantages, which dawned upon him gradually,
while Elizabeth still sobbed. He rose and paced
up and down in front of her, thinking the matter
over. After all, a wife was the last thing that he
wanted&mdash;just then, when his career was opening out
before him in unexpectedly brilliant colors. He
realized perfectly the value of his own good looks,
and the loss of prestige that marriage would involve.
Matrimony is a mistake for an artist&mdash;he
had told himself this many times in the last few
months. And yet, having once made the mistake,
having won this beautiful girl for his wife, how
could he give her up. There was the chance that
she might change her mind again, and return to her
first love. Then it was sweet to feel that she was in
his power, that he could at any time bring her to
terms by threatening to publish the fact that she
had concealed all this time. True, the marriage
might be dissolved&mdash;he had not much doubt himself
that it could be; but either this plan did not
occur to Elizabeth, or she dreaded the inevitable
gossip and publicity. At all events, it was not his
place, he thought, to suggest it to her. He held
the mastery of the situation, and he was determined
to improve it to the uttermost. And having arrived
at this conclusion, he suddenly stopped before her
and spoke in a tone of unwonted resolution.
173

"Listen to me, Elizabeth," he said. "I don't
know why you are making this scene. In what has
the situation changed since&mdash;let us say, last week?
I don't ask you to acknowledge our marriage at
once&mdash;indeed it is impossible for me to do so, as I
am not&mdash;worse luck&mdash;in a position just now to
support a wife."

Elizabeth, in her surprise, stopped crying and
stared up at him blankly. "You don't want the
marriage acknowledged?" she repeated, utterly
taken aback.

"Not just now," said Paul, calmly. "It would
be as inconvenient for me, as it seems to be for
you. No, all I ask is for you to see me occasionally,
to think of me more kindly, and in time&mdash;perhaps
in time, dearest, you will care for me again as you
used to."

He went on to dilate on this hope. Elizabeth's
tears as she listened, ceased. A feeling of relief
stole over her, the reaction which follows so often
upon violent distress. "In time," Paul said. Ah,
yes, her heart answered, there is no knowing what
wonders time may accomplish. It might even&mdash;who
could tell?&mdash;find a way for her out of this terrible
perplexity.

Yet the thought was illogical. Of what use was
it to put off the evil day? There was a side of her
nature which was brave and straightforward, which
detested false pretences and evasions, and all the net-work
of deception in which her secret had already
involved her; which called out upon her boldly to
tell the truth, since every day that she kept it hidden
174
only made the final disclosure more difficult. But
there was another side which counselled compromise,
which shrank from facing the inevitable, which
lived only in the present and refused to take thought
for the future. And finally there was a side which
did not reason, which simply remembered the look
in a man's eyes, when he had spoken to her the day
before of her picture.

How would it be if he knew the truth? Would
he make allowances for her, would he be magnanimous
enough to forgive? Ah, no, he had judged
her harshly for no apparent reason. Such a discovery
would put an end entirely to all his faith in
her.

For she felt instinctively how it would strike him&mdash;this
impulsive action of a thoughtless girl, who
had rushed into marriage as if it were a mere
farce, and taken upon herself, lightly, the most
solemn vows, only to repent of them quite as readily.
He would pronounce her hopelessly light and fickle,
he would never believe that she was capable of any
deeper feeling. His presentiment, distrust&mdash;whatever
it was that had kept him from her&mdash;would be
justified, and&mdash;and there would be the end of it.
And the best thing that could happen, that stern
inner voice called out.

But she would not listen to it&mdash;not yet, at least.
She must see him once or twice first, probe his feelings
a little more surely, prepare him a little, perhaps,
to judge her more gently.... Some time&mdash;very
soon, perhaps,&mdash;she would tell him herself,
but&mdash;not now, not now....
175

Her head ached, she was physically exhausted,
and Paul was waiting, impatiently, for her decision.
She had an engagement, too, for luncheon&mdash;she
remembered that mechanically.... In this
matter-of-fact world of ours, the every-day and
the tragic incidents of life jostle one another so
closely.

"I&mdash;I must go," she murmured, confusedly.
"I've been here too long. We can talk about all
this another time."

"But you consent," he said eagerly. "You wish
to keep it secret, awhile longer? That is the agreement
for the present?"

She hesitated for a moment. "Yes," she said at
last, "that is the agreement, till&mdash;till I have time to
think it over. And now I must go." She drew out
the little jeweled watch that Mrs. Van Antwerp had
given her, among other valuable things, at Christmas.
"I am going out to luncheon, and I am supposed
at present to be in my room, recovering from
last night's ball."

"What a gay person you are!" Paul said, regarding
her complacently. "Ah, Elizabeth, if you wanted
to be nice, you could help me a great deal in my
profession."

"Help you?" she repeated, staring at him
blankly.

"Yes, in a social way," he explained. "It always
helps an artist to be taken up by swell people.
There's your friend Mrs. Van Antwerp&mdash;can't you&mdash;there's
a good girl&mdash;persuade her to do something
for me?"
176

"I heard her ask you to call," she returned,
coldly.

"Yes, but she could do more than that," he said.
"She could, for instance, have me sing and ask
people to hear me. I need a start, I need patrons
among society people; and that is exactly, my dear
girl, what you can get me."

They were walking slowly by this time towards
the entrance of the Park, and suddenly she turned
and faced him with one of those flashes of defiance,
which he rather admired. "Let me understand,"
she said, quickly, and a pale, cold gleam lighted up
her white face, like the glint of steel upon marble.
"You want me to&mdash;to get you invitations, to persuade
people to ask you to sing? This is the&mdash;the
price of your silence?"

He shrugged his shoulders, not much disturbed
by the scorn in her voice. "If you choose to put it
so plainly&mdash;yes," he said. "After all, it is not
much to ask, and you ought, one would think, to be
glad if you can help me."

She walked on beside him in gloomy silence. "It's
not much to ask," she said, in a low, bitter voice,
"but it involves&mdash;have you thought of that?&mdash;my
seeing you constantly."

"And is that so terrible?" he asked, reddening.

"It's not pleasant," she said, shortly "but I suppose
I must&mdash;submit. I'm in your power; you can
ask what you please." They had reached the entrance
of the Park, and she turned to him, as if
to dismiss him. "I promise, then," she said. "I'll
do what I can to help you&mdash;socially, and in return
177
you must promise to treat me as you would any
other acquaintance&mdash;not force me to meet you again,
or let people suppose that there is anything between
us. Do you agree to that?"

"I suppose I must," he said, disconsolately,
"though it's a harder condition, by far, than mine."

Again that cold, scornful gleam flashed across her
face.

"Oh, you'll resign yourself to it," she said. "It's
much more to the point to get&mdash;the invitations. I'll
see that my side of the bargain is fulfilled." She
drew down her veil, glancing anxiously across the
wide Square, where street-cars, bicycles and wagons
all converge from different directions and in inextricable
confusion. "Don't come any further with
me," she said. "I don't wish people to see us together."

She left him abruptly as she spoke, and he stood
for a moment and watched her cross the Square and
take a car at the corner. He was not quite satisfied
with the interview; she had been too independent,
too scornful. It hurt his pride. But the situation
was full of possibilities. He felt that his rash marriage
had been a stroke of genius.

Elizabeth, meanwhile, was making her way home,
with a feeling of tremulous relief, much as if she
had escaped unexpectedly from shipwreck, with at
least a plank to cling to, and bear her perhaps to
ultimate safety. Yet how slight that plank was she
might have realized, had she known that Julian
Gerard, as he entered the Park on horseback, had
seen her walk down one of the side paths, with the
178
man who, only a day before, had aroused his jealous
suspicions.

"And she said she didn't know him," he thought,
with a fierce throb of pain, and rode on, frowning,
into the Park.


179

Chapter XX


"My dear Julian," wrote Mrs. Bobby
Van Antwerp to Mr. Gerard a week
later, "you are, I think, neglecting
us shamefully. What has become of you? If you are
inclined to perform a charitable action, do come in
to tea to-morrow afternoon. You don't generally,
I know, patronize such mild functions, but we are
to have a little music"&mdash;

"A little music?" mused Gerard, knitting his
brows and thrusting out his under lip, as the note
dropped from his hand. "That means, of course,
that young Halleck. It's something new for Eleanor
to go in for music. But it's her doing, of course. I
suppose she really cares for the fellow. And yet
what a pity&mdash;what a pity that she should throw
herself away like that!" He sat gazing absently
before him, his pen in his hand, while the work upon
which he had been engaged when Mrs. Bobby's
note arrived&mdash;an article for a scientific magazine&mdash;remained
without the finishing touches he had intended
to bestow.

He had not seen Elizabeth since that morning in
the Park.

He had carefully refrained from going where he
might see her. He had denied himself, once for
180
all, that unprofitable and mysterious pleasure of
watching her across the ball-room, while he leaned
inertly against the wall, or talked, in his weary
way, to some woman to whom he felt himself indebted.
No, thank Heaven, he had been warned in
time; there was no danger of his being made a fool
of a second time.

His mind wandered back across the gulf of years,
to that other woman whom he had loved so desperately
once, whose shadow still stood between him
and the happiness which seemed, now and again,
within his grasp. He thought of the mad infatuation,
the bitter disillusion, the restless travelling
to and fro, the final settling down into cynical indifference.... and then long afterwards, when
the indifference had grown into a habit, and he
dreaded nothing more than to have it disturbed, he
had met this girl who had exercised upon him from
the first a curious effect, half repellant, half attractive,
and wholly baffling and alarming, whose hair
he had objected to because it was "too red" and
who played the piano with a force and fire and
passion, which stirred his heart as he had resolved
it should never be stirred again.

Gerard had always intended to marry, but he
proposed, in spite of the efforts of Eleanor Van
Antwerp and other anxious friends, to take his time
about it. He had his ideal of the sort of wife he
wanted&mdash;a being as different as possible from his
first love, and almost as tiresome a compound of
all the domestic virtues as that mythical personage
whom Hannah More's hero had once gone in search
181
of. But, unlike that estimable individual, he had
fallen in love with a woman far removed from his
ideal, of doubtful antecedents which he liked no
better than Bobby Van Antwerp, of qualities the
reverse of domestic, and the type of hair and coloring
which he had long illogically, but none the
less strongly, associated with a certain lack of moral
sense.

Yet though Gerard could not help his feelings,
he could certainly control his actions, and he was
determined to keep away from Elizabeth Van Vorst&mdash;more
especially now since there seemed to be
some unaccountable understanding between her and
that young Halleck.

Yet that very fact made him the more anxious
to see her, and find out for himself how far his
suspicions were justified. "Good Heavens," thought
Gerard, getting up and pacing restlessly to and fro
"how can she care for a fellow like that&mdash;so second-rate,
so superficial, such a&mdash;such a cad? What
is Eleanor thinking of to have him at the house?
Some one really ought to give her a hint&mdash;not I;
but&mdash;some one." ...

The end of it all was that he strolled into Mrs.
Van Antwerp's drawing-room that afternoon, his
usual air of well-bred impassiveness unmoved by the
sight of Paul Halleck seated at the piano, and the
cynosure of several pairs of admiring feminine eyes.

Elizabeth's eyes were not among them. She was
in a back room pouring tea. But Gerard had no
sooner assured himself of her being thus harmlessly
employed, than his jealous heart suggested that
182
there was something sinister in such apparent indifference.

He wandered into the other room as soon as he
decently could. She was seated at the tea-table, for
the moment, entirely alone. Seen thus off guard,
for she did not at first perceive Gerard, there was
something indefinably weary and listless in her attitude.
She was paler even than she had been that
day at the Portrait Show, and the lines beneath
her eyes were not black, but purple. It would have
gone ill with her reputation as a beauty had it been
put to the vote that afternoon. But it was Gerard's
peculiarity, his misfortune perhaps, that she appealed
to him most at times when to the world at
large she was looking her worst. He stood watching
her for a moment. Presently she looked up.
She caught sight of him. Instantly the warm,
lovely color rushed into her cheeks, only to retreat,
and leave her paler than before&mdash;but not till he
had seen it.

His manner was very gentle as he approached her
and asked for a cup of tea. She poured it out mechanically,
with a hand that trembled.

"We have not seen you lately," she said, with
eyes carefully riveted on the tea-things. "Eleanor
was wondering&mdash;what had become of you."

"Indeed! It was very kind of her to give me a
thought." Gerard stirred his tea absently. "I was
busy," he said "with an article I had promised for
a magazine."

"Ah! You write a great deal, don't you?" Elizabeth
183
looked up with some interest. "I should like
to see some of your articles, if I may."

He smiled. "You don't know what you're asking.
You'd find them very dull."

"What, because I'm so dull myself?" she asked,
with a flash of spirit.

"I told you once before," he said, in the tone
that he had used to her at the studio "that I didn't
think you&mdash;that."

"Ah, but you think me other things that are&mdash;worse."

"As what, for instance?" he asked, smiling.

"Oh frivolous, and vain, and heartless. A lot
of horrid things."

"I only said you seemed so."

"Ah, then you think I'm better than I seem?"
she asked, flippantly, yet with a swift inward pang.

He seemed to consider. "I think you are very&mdash;incomprehensible,"
he said at last.

She bent down over the tea-things, so that he
could not see her face. "Oh, that's only," she said,
in a low voice "because you haven't the key to the
enigma. If you had it"&mdash;She paused. "You
might not like the things you understood," she concluded.

Gerard put down his untasted cup. "I'm willing
to take the risk," he said, deliberately.

He waited, as if for an answer, but none came.
She appeared to busy herself with the tea-things.
In the next room Paul Halleck began to sing the
Evening Star song. It seemed to Gerard that
184
Elizabeth turned a shade paler than she had been
before.

"He has a fine voice," he said, when the song was
finished. "Don't you think so?"

She started. "Yes, I&mdash;I think so," she said, mechanically.

"I was surprised a little at Eleanor's going in
for music," Gerard went on. "It isn't her line,
generally."

"No, it isn't her line," Elizabeth repeated, in the
same mechanical tones. Suddenly she met his eyes
defiantly. "I asked her to have him here," she
said.

"Ah, you asked her?" Gerard drew his breath
quickly. "I thought he was a&mdash;a friend of yours."

"You thought so?" she returned quickly, and
then in a low voice, as if she dreaded the answer:
"Why?"

"Why?" He repeated her question as if it surprised
him. For a moment he seemed to hesitate;
then, as if forming a sudden resolution: "I thought
so," he said, steadily, and looking her straight in
the face "for one thing, because I saw you walking
in the Park with him one morning."

"Ah, you&mdash;you saw me?" She seemed to gasp
for breath. Then, with a quick, impetuous movement,
she pushed the tea-things away from her.
"And so," she said, turning to him suddenly, her
cheeks flushed, her eyes sparkling "you&mdash;you put
the worst construction upon that, you think more
ill of me than ever?"&mdash;

He had turned very pale, but still his voice was
185
steady. "I don't know why I should think ill of
you, for such a simple thing as that. But if there
is any secret about it"&mdash;he fixed his eyes upon her
coldly, haughtily&mdash;"if the meeting was not intended
to be known, why I&mdash;I'm sorry I should have seen
it. Of course I should not mention it&mdash;to any one
else."

She flushed a little, then grew pale, before the
scorn in his eyes. "There is&mdash;there is no secret,"
she said, in a low voice. "You can mention it&mdash;to
whom you please."

"I confess I was a little surprised," he went on,
without heeding her, and this time a note of keen
anxiety pierced through the studied quietness of
his voice, his gaze softened, as if imploring her to
give him the explanation which he had no right to
demand. "I was a little taken aback," he said, "because
I understood you to say&mdash;the day before&mdash;that
you hardly knew him."

"Yes, I&mdash;I remember." She leaned back in her
chair, staring before her with hard, bright eyes.
"When I told you that," she said, slowly "I&mdash;I
lied."

It gave him a keen shock to hear her pronounce
the word. He did not speak, and she looked up at
him presently with a little, deprecating smile.
"Now," she said, softly "I've shocked you, haven't
I?"

He was silent for a moment. "No," he said, at
last "not that; but&mdash;I'm sorry. I don't like to
think of you as&mdash;misstating anything, even if the
matter is of no importance."
186

She had taken up a teaspoon, and was playing
with it absently. "I don't know," she said, slowly
"why you should care."

"Don't you?" He turned his eyes away. "I
wish to Heaven I didn't," he said, low and fiercely.
The words were not intended for her, but she heard
them and again the warm, beautiful color rushed
into her cheeks. An answer trembled on her lips,
but she struggled not to say it; struggled against the
desire to bring that glow to his face, that light to
his eyes, which she knew so well lay dormant, beneath
the heavy lids. She knew, ah, she knew.
While he stayed away she had her misgivings, but
now that she saw him again, she read his heart, even
as she had done at the Portrait Show. She had only
to be herself, her best self, and she held him captive,
he could not escape. Yet, paradoxically, her better
instincts urged upon her to show him her worst
side, to say the things which hurt and shocked
him.

While she hesitated, people came crowding in
from the next room. In the confusion that ensued,
Gerard was forced away from the table. He fell
back against the wall, and watched Elizabeth while,
with instinctive self-command, she fulfilled the different
demands made upon her. He saw Halleck
go up to her gaily, flushed with his success, and
bending over her, murmur a few jesting words,
which she heard without a smile. Gerard could
have killed him for the air of proprietorship which
was even more pronounced than at the musicale.
But she&mdash;how did she like it? He scanned her face
187
eagerly. There was no softness there, no answering
gleam of pleasure; rather a dull, dogged look
of submission, which seemed to cover, or Gerard deceived
himself, an instinctive shrinking, a powerless
resentment.

"She doesn't care for him," he thought, with a
quick, sharp sense of relief. "And yet&mdash;she has
to be civil to him, she has to do things to help him.
Why, for Heaven's sake, why?" He wandered
into the other room, tormenting himself with this
question, and found his hostess there.

"What do you think of my new protegé?" she
asked, detaining him as he took his leave.

"What, Halleck? Oh, he sings very well," he
returned, absently.

"I never before posed as a patron of rising musicians,"
she went on, "but Elizabeth knew him, it
seems, in the country, and asked if I would mind
helping him a little. She's so fond of music, you
know." She spoke quite innocently. Gerard gave
her a quick, searching glance. Apparently she
suspected nothing. Yet she was a woman of quick
perceptions. Perhaps, after all, it was he who was
mistaken; his jealous, suspicious nature had led
him into unnecessary torture. No wonder she had
met his doubt with defiance, had not deigned to
justify herself, or to dispel a distrust which he had
no right to display. In the sudden, glad, unreasoning
reaction, he was ready to heap all manner of insulting
epithets upon himself.

"I think your efforts will be repaid," he said, inclined
in his relief to be generous. "Halleck has a
188
fine voice. I shouldn't wonder if he were quite a
success."

"It was very nice of you to come in," she said.
"You have been such a recluse lately. What have
you been doing?"

"Oh, the whirl of excitement in which I've been
living was too much for me," he declared "and so
I've given up society for awhile, and am going in
for hard study by way of rest."

"Good gracious! That sounds very impressive,"
she said. "I'm almost afraid to suggest, under the
circumstances, that you should take a seat in our
box at the opera to-night. And yet I wish you
would, Julian, just by way of doing me a favor, for
some people I've asked are not coming, and Bobby
is away, and Elizabeth and I will be quite alone."

He smiled. "I don't think there's much chance
of your being alone very long," he said. Yet he
promised at last to take one of the vacant seats,
though he had refused several other invitations for
that evening. Mrs. Bobby's eyes sparkled as if she
had achieved a victory.

"Julian is coming to-night," she announced to
Elizabeth, when the musicale was over and the last
guest had departed.

"Is he?" Elizabeth spoke without apparent interest,
as she sank, with a weary look, into a chair
in front of the fire.

"You are tired. Would you rather not go to-night?"

"Oh, no"&mdash;with a languid gesture. "Music
doesn't tire me!"
189

"And yet," said Mrs. Bobby, who had taken the
seat opposite her and was watching her thoughtfully,
"you didn't seem to care enough about it to
come in to listen to your friend this afternoon."

Elizabeth blushed. "I could hear him in the other
room," she said.

"Where, besides, you seemed to be very well entertained,"
said Mrs. Bobby, serenely. "Still, I
don't think it was nice of you. It is hard on the
poor man, after flirting with him in the country, to
treat him so indifferently in town."

"I didn't flirt with him," said Elizabeth, but her
protest was faint, and seemed purely perfunctory.
In fact, she was not sorry that Mrs. Bobby had
adopted this theory, realizing that a half-truth may
sometimes be the most effective barrier to a knowledge
of the whole.

"Don't tell me anything so wildly improbable,
my dear," said Mrs. Bobby. "My knowledge of
human nature will not allow me to believe that a
pretty girl and a handsome young singer, thrown
together for weeks in the country, as I believe you
were, did not indulge in a tremendous flirtation.
But seriously, Elizabeth, I am glad that it went
no further, and that you have recovered so easily.
For I can imagine that you lost your heart to him
a little. Confess, Elizabeth, didn't you?"

"Perhaps I did," said Elizabeth, staring immovably
into the fire "but one gets over such things,
you know."

"Indeed one does," said Mrs. Bobby. "I was
desperately in love at seventeen, and cried my eyes
190
out when they made me give the man up; and yet
had I married him, I should have been the most
wretched being in the world, instead of a much
happier woman than I deserve to be, thanks to a
husband far too good for me. (But that, dear, is
between ourselves. I always try to make Bobby
think it's the other way.) But imagine how dreadful
it would have been, if I had had my own foolish
way at seventeen. And so I am glad, Elizabeth,
that you have got over your penchant for this
young artist, who is good-looking, and sings well,
and all that; but who is&mdash;even if I knew anything
about him, which I don't&mdash;quite the last man I
should like you to marry."

Elizabeth's face was turned away. "I don't
know," she said in a low voice, "why you think
of that."

"Oh, I was only speculating on what might have
been," said Mrs. Bobby, lightly. "I know," she
went on after a moment, stealing a furtive glance at
the girl's averted face, "I know the sort of man I
should like you to marry, Elizabeth. He must be
older than you, considerably older; of a serious disposition,
with a strong will, stronger than yours,
for you might be perhaps a little hard to manage;
fond of music and fond of books; rich, and with a
good position of course; and&mdash;and I should like him
to be every bit as nice as Bobby, if such a thing is
possible."

Elizabeth turned her white face towards her
friend. "And you think," she said, in a low, stifled
191
voice, "that I should come up to the standard of
a paragon like that?"

"My dear," said Mrs. Bobby, wisely, "paragons
don't marry other paragons, or the world would be
somewhat more dull than it is at present. A man
who is very serious should marry a woman who is
a trifle frivolous, and in that way they strike the
happy medium."

"I don't know," said Elizabeth. "They would
be more likely, I should think, to strike a&mdash;a discordancy.
It would be fatiguing to try to please a
man like that. One could never, do what one would,
come up to his standard."

"You wouldn't have to," said Mrs. Bobby, softly,
"he would think you perfect, if&mdash;he loved you."

"Do you think so?" said Elizabeth, with rather
a dreary smile. "I think, for my part, that he would
be harder to satisfy, he would exact all the more,
because&mdash;he loved you." She sat pondering the
idea for a moment, then with a careless little gesture,
she seemed to dismiss the subject as a thing of
small consequence. "It's much better not to try
to satisfy people like that," she declared. "What
a lot of time we are wasting! It must be time to
dress." She got up and moved towards the door.

Mrs. Bobby followed her with her eyes. "I'll
send Celeste to you," she said. "Wear your most
becoming gown. Look your best, and do your hair
the way I like it. I assure you, such trifles have
their effect&mdash;even upon a paragon."


192

Chapter XXI


"Look my best!" Elizabeth repeated,
standing before her muslin-skirted
dressing-table, and staring at the haggard
apparition that met her eyes. "Wear my most
becoming gown, do my hair the most becoming
way! It all sounds so easy. But what can bring
back my color, what can take away these terrible
dark rings, this horrible strained, anxious look?
Any one can see, to look at me, that I've something
on my mind....

"... I shall never tell him the truth&mdash;never,
never. I may beat about the bush, but I shall always
leave myself a loop-hole to crawl out of. And yet if
I could only consult him&mdash;consult some one&mdash;find
out what I really ought to do. But no, no, I don't
dare risk it; it would be terrible to be advised&mdash;just
the way I don't want. I must decide on some plan
myself. But&mdash;Heaven knows what!" She stood
for a while motionless, gazing helplessly into a mist
of perplexities.

The little Sèvres clock on her mantel-piece roused
her as it struck the hour, and she began hastily to
dress. She drew the rippling waves of her hair
into the fashion that Mrs. Bobby liked, she put on
her favorite gown, a charming creation of white
193
lace and chiffon, relieved by touches of pale green;
she tried conscientiously to look her best, but still
her cheeks were pale, there was the strained look
in her eyes.

She was about ready when Mrs. Bobby's maid
came to help her, bringing a box of flowers that had
just that moment arrived. Celeste, a thrifty person,
regarded them with some disgust. She could tell
them, these gentlemen, that it was of little use to
waste their money on Mademoiselle, who did not
care about, sometimes hardly glanced at, the flowers
which some other young lady would give her eyes
to receive. Ah, well, that was the unequal way in
which things in this world were arranged. Celeste
disposed of the matter thus, with a philosophic
French shrug of the shoulders.

But there was no counting on such a capricious
person as Mademoiselle. To-night, as she glanced
at the card in the box, she blushed beautifully, took
out the flowers with care, and read with eager eyes
the few lines that the giver had scrawled, apparently
in great haste and in pencil:

"This afternoon I was unspeakably rude&mdash;even
brutal. Forgive me&mdash;what right had I to take you
to task for your actions? My only excuse is that
I care&mdash;I can't help caring&mdash;so desperately. I send
you white roses&mdash;they suit you best. You wore one
that I gave you&mdash;do you remember?&mdash;but probably
you don't&mdash;the first night I saw you. If you are
very merciful, if you accept my repentance, wear
one to-night&mdash;in token of forgiveness."

"In token of forgiveness?" Elizabeth pressed
194
one of the exquisite, creamy-white roses against her
glowing cheeks. "You wore one the first night I
saw you&mdash;probably you don't remember?" Ah,
yes, she remembered&mdash;but that was different. She
could not wear one now. "Yet only in token of
forgiveness?" With a quick, passionate gesture,
she raised it to her lips, then fastened it carefully
amidst the lace of her gown.

Celeste, whose presence she had forgotten, bent
down discreetly, with a suppressed smile, to arrange
the folds of her train. Ah, clearly, after all, there
was one gentleman who did not waste his money on
Mademoiselle.

"Madame wished Mademoiselle to look well to-night,"
she observed, after a moment. "I think
Madame will be satisfied."

Mademoiselle glanced at herself again, and started
as she looked. Could this brilliant young beauty,
her small head proudly erect, her eyes brilliant, her
cheeks aflame, be the same woman whose haggard
reflection had stared back at her from the same
mirror only half-an-hour before?

She did not feel like the same woman. The
doubts, the fears, which had beset her then seemed
mere chimeras, the fancies of a morbid brain. She
felt gay, confident, strong enough to conquer even
fate. Celeste was right&mdash;she looked her best. Mrs.
Bobby's words rang in her ears. "Such trifles have
their effect&mdash;even on a paragon." And then again&mdash;"He
would think you perfect as you were if&mdash;he
loved you." "No, he need not think me perfect,"
she murmured to her mirror, "but he must&mdash;he
195
shall think me beautiful. And that is more to the
point," she concluded, as she gathered up fan and
gloves and left the room.

The opera that night was Carmen, which peculiarly
suited her phase of mind. There is no other
which so thoroughly embodies the spirit of recklessness,
the triumph of the senses, the frank, impulsive,
untrammeled enjoyment of life and of living.
To be sure, there is the tragic ending&mdash;but before
that, three acts of brilliant melody, glowing
with color, with warm, sensuous pleasure.

Gerard was waiting in the box when they arrived.
On the stage Carmen&mdash;that ideal Carmen of whom
Mérimée dreamed and Bizet set to music&mdash;had just
appeared upon the scene of Don Jose's misfortune,
and was warbling, with bewitching abandon, the
notes of the Habanera.

Gerard's face, which had an anxious look, brightened
wonderfully, radiantly, as the two women entered
the box. He murmured eagerly a few grateful
words in Elizabeth's ear, and took the seat directly
behind her, which he did not abandon, even
though his predictions were justified, and Mrs. Van
Antwerp's box was filled, after the first act, with
men who looked anything but pleased at finding
that particular place monopolized. Mrs. Bobby,
however, seemed delighted to entertain them, was
gracious, charming and piquante, and elicited from
a stern dowager in the next box severe criticisms
on the wiles of young married women, and their
reprehensible manner of diverting to themselves the
attention due to the young girls under their charge.
196

Elizabeth hardly noticed the men who entered the
box. She sat with eyes fixed upon the stage, upon
that intensely real music drama which she had seen
many times already, but which never lost its fascination;
yet acutely conscious all the while through
every fibre of her being of Gerard's presence, of his
watching her, of his bending over her, now and
again, to murmur a word in her ear. And as for
him, she had appealed to him most, perhaps, at least
to a certain side of his nature, that afternoon in her
pale languor; and yet he could not but feel his
senses thrilled, his pulses throb, when she was so
warmly, vividly, humanly beautiful as she was to-night.
For the moment he was carried beyond himself,
his doubts dispelled, or at least forgotten.

And yet, as the evening wore on, some subtle influence
in the music or the play seemed to recall
them. At the end of the second act she turned to
him, the strains of the Toreador song still ringing
in her ear, and felt, insensibly a sudden lack of sympathy,
a cloud that seemed to have drifted between
them. His brows were knit, his face moody.

"You don't like it!" she said, staring up at
him with wondering, disappointed eyes.

"What, the opera?" He started as if his
thoughts had been elsewhere. "No, I don't like it,"
he said, frankly. "It jars upon me somehow,
brings up memories"&mdash;he paused. "Oh, it's some
drop of Puritan blood, I suppose," he went on,
impatiently, "that asserts itself in me. I can't view
the thing from an artistic standpoint. I can't forget
197
for a moment what a heartless creature the
woman is. When I see her ruining men's lives,
luring them on, turning from one to another&mdash;it's
too realistic&mdash;there are too many women like that"&mdash;He
was speaking low and bitterly, with a strange
vehemence, but suddenly he broke off, with a short
laugh. "Oh, it's absurd," he said, "to take a
thing like that seriously."

Elizabeth did not smile. She leaned back in her
chair as if she were suddenly weary. "Poor Carmen!"
she said, in a low voice. "You're very hard
on her." She held up her fan before her eyes, as
if the light hurt them. A shadow seemed to fall
upon her beauty, effacing its color and brilliance,
bringing out again into strong relief the dark rings
under the eyes, the lines about the mouth. She sat
in silence for awhile, but suddenly she turned to
him.

"I'm going to shock you, I'm afraid," she said,
"but&mdash;do you know&mdash;somehow I can't help seeing
the other side. What is a woman to do, if she
changes against her will? Is she to abide always,
inexorably, by the results of a mistake?" A note
of passionate feeling thrilled her voice, she fixed
her eyes anxiously, intently, upon Gerard. "There
are so many questions that might arise," she went
on, eagerly, as he did not answer at once. "One
might, for instance, make a promise&mdash;a very solemn
promise, and find out afterwards that it was&mdash;a
mistake, that it would ruin one's whole life to keep
it; and&mdash;and one might break it, and the other person
198
might think himself very much injured; and
yet&mdash;would you think the woman in that case so
very much to blame?"

Gerard thought he understood. With the conviction
came a sense of passionate relief, which yet he
hesitated, with the fastidious scruples of a proud
and honorable man, to grasp in its entirety.

"I&mdash;I don't think I'm competent to express an
opinion," he said, in a low voice. "You should
ask&mdash;some one else."

"There's no one else whom I can ask," she said
quickly, and with her eyes always fixed imploringly
upon him. "Tell me&mdash;what you think. What
should a woman do in a case like that?"

"I&mdash;it's a difficult situation," he said, still holding
under control his eager desire to advise her in
the only way in which it seemed to him possible to
advise her. But how could he trust his own judgment?
"I"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"Personally," he said,
"I can't imagine holding a woman to a promise that
she has&mdash;repented of; but other men might&mdash;probably
would feel differently."

"Yes," she said, sadly, "he&mdash;this man does."

"And you&mdash;the woman is quite sure she has
made a mistake," he asked, eagerly.

"Yes, yes, quite sure," she said, quickly, "a terrible
mistake."

"Then," said Gerard, and he drew a long sigh
as of intense relief, "I don't think there could be
two opinions on the subject. No one could advise
you&mdash;this woman to ruin her life for a mistake, especially
199
if the&mdash;the man were unworthy?" He
looked at her questioningly.

"He seemed to her unworthy," she said, in a low
voice.

"Then, for Heaven's sake," he asked, almost
fiercely, "how can you hesitate?"

She did not speak, but turned her eyes towards
the stage and again placed her fan so that it shielded
them. All over the house there was the subdued
rustle of people returning to their seats. The orchestra
sounded the first notes of the third act, the
curtain rose upon the gypsy camp. During Michaela's
solo and the scene between the two men,
Elizabeth still sat silent, her fan before her face.
The act was well advanced before she turned to
Gerard.

"Then," she said, "you would advise me to&mdash;to
break my word?"

"Under the circumstances&mdash;yes," he said, steadily.
"But don't," he went on quickly, and passionate
vibration thrilled his voice, more unrepressed
than ever before, "don't be guided by my opinion.
In this particular case it is&mdash;impossible for me to
judge impartially."

"Is it," she asked softly, and then added quickly,
as if to avert an answer, "still, I'm glad to know
your opinion. I feel sure you wouldn't say what
you don't think. Thank you&mdash;thank you very
much." Her tone was low and subdued, like that
of a grateful child. She leaned back in her chair
with a look of relief, that seemed both physical and
200
mental. She did not speak again till near the end
of the act, when Carmen reads her fortune in the
cards. "I wonder," Elizabeth said then, softly,
"what she sees in them."

"I had my fortune told once," she observed,
turning to Gerard, as the curtain fell. "It was
when I was at school, and I went with one of the
girls to a famous palmist. He told me all sorts of
strange, true things about the past, and about the
future."&mdash;She paused.

"Well, about the future?" he asked, smiling.
"One doesn't care about the past. But he predicted,
no doubt, all sorts of delightful things about
the future?"

"No." She stared thoughtfully before her with
knit brows. "He said"&mdash;she spoke low and hesitatingly&mdash;"he
said there was luck in my hand&mdash;plenty
of it; I should have splendid opportunities.
But&mdash;he said there was a line of misfortune, which
crossed the other line and might make it utterly
useless; that there was danger of some kind&mdash;he
couldn't tell what, threatening me about my twenty-first
year, and that, you know, is very near; he said
there were strange lines&mdash;tragic, unusual,"&mdash;She
stopped. "It sounds very ridiculous," but though
she tried to smile, her voice trembled, "and yet&mdash;I
remember it frightened me at the time, and does
still&mdash;a little&mdash;when I think of it."

"But you don't surely," cried Gerard, "my dear
child, you don't suppose he knew a thing about it?"

"I don't know. I believe I'm superstitious&mdash;are
not you?"
201

"I'm afraid I am," he said, "but not about things
like that. I've seen too many predictions of the kind
prove false, to give them a thought."

"It is foolish to worry about them," she admitted,
but still she sat apparently deep in thought
and played absently with her fan. At last she looked
up with her most brilliant smile. "I don't know
why it is," she said, "but we seem to be fated on
unpleasant subjects. And yet the opera is so gay.
Do let us try, for the rest of the evening, to think
of pleasant things." She turned and held out her
hand, smiling, to a man who entered the box. For
the rest of the opera she was brilliant, animated,
beautiful, as she had been at first.

"And now you are satisfied," she said, looking
at Gerard with laughing eyes, as the curtain fell
for the last time. "Carmen comes to a bad end.
According to your principles! she deserved it."

"Ah, my principles!" he said, smiling. "I'm
afraid I don't live up to them very much."

"Don't you?" She gave him a quick, searching
glance, as he stood with her cloak in his hand. "I
wish I could believe that," she murmured. "I
should be a little less&mdash;afraid of you."

He placed the cloak about her shoulders. "It is
I who am afraid of you," he whispered, bending
over her, "and have been ever since I knew you."

Her eyes fell, and she fumbled nervously with the
fastening of the cloak. "Ah, you were afraid of
me?" she said, under her breath. "And now"&mdash;

"Oh, I've grown very brave," he murmured, as
he followed her out of the box, "you can't frighten
202
me away any longer." The jesting words lingered
in her ear as they left the Opera House.

"Ah, if he knew!" she said to herself, as she
sank into her corner of the carriage. "He doesn't
know. And yet I told him the exact truth. It's
not my fault, if he&mdash;misunderstood."

And Gerard meanwhile was telling himself that
he understood it all.

"Poor child!" he murmured to himself, as he lit
a cigar and sauntered slowly home. "So that was
it. Of course, she thought she loved him&mdash;the first
man she met, and when he turned up felt herself
bound&mdash;I see it all! And she has suffered&mdash;had terrible
pangs of conscience over this thing. And I
who misjudged her all this time&mdash;imagined I don't
know what&mdash;could I have advised her differently?
Surely not. The fellow's not worthy of her. Neither
am I. She won't look at me, probably. And yet&mdash;one
can but try"&mdash;


203

Chapter XXII


It was mentioned generally, at various sewing-classes
and other mild functions during
Lent, that Julian Gerard was very attentive,
all of a sudden, to Elizabeth Van Vorst. Some
people, less accurate or more imaginative than the
rest, went so far as to announce the engagement as
an actual fact.

"And, if so, it's all Eleanor Van Antwerp's doing,"
Mrs. Hartington observed in private to her
intimate friends. "She was determined to make
the match from the beginning. I saw the way she
threw the girl at his head at a dinner in the country,
but I never for a moment thought she would
succeed&mdash;with Julian Gerard of all men, who is
so desperately afraid of being taken in."

Julian Gerard, by that time, had well-nigh forgotten
that such a fear had ever disturbed him, or
if he did remember it, it was to regard it, so far as
Elizabeth was concerned, as profanation. Since that
evening at the opera, his remorseful fancy had
placed her on a pinnacle, which she found at times,
it must be confessed, a little difficult to maintain.
It was his misfortune and hers, that he could never
view her in the right perspective, never realize that
204
she was neither a saint nor the reverse, but merely
a woman, and painfully human at that.

But since he chose to consider her a saint, she
did her best to live up to the character. She kept
Lent strictly that year as she had never done before,
went to church morning and evening, denied
herself bonbons and other luxuries, and worked
with unskilled fingers but great diligence at certain
oddly-constructed garments which were doled out
to her and other young women every week as a
Lenten penance, and incidentally for the good of
the poor. If in most cases the actual penance fell to
the lot of their maids, why, the poor were none the
wiser, and certainly much the better clothed. But
Elizabeth insisted on putting in all the painful
stitches in the hard, coarse stuff herself, and looked
very pretty bending over it, as Mr. Gerard thought
when he came in one day and found her thus employed.

It pleased him, of course. He did not attach
much importance, himself, to these things&mdash;this constant
church-going, these small penances; yet, manlike,
it seemed to him right and fitting that she
should regard them differently. And then it was
pleasant, after service, to meet her in the vestibule.
How many incipient love affairs have been helped
along, brought to a climax perhaps, by the convenient
afternoon service, and the sauntering walks
home in the lingering twilight!

To Elizabeth there was an indefinable charm in
those ever-lengthening Lenten days, rung in and
out to the music of church bells, and marked, as
205
the season advanced and Easter approached, by the
growing green of the grass, and the budding shoots
of the trees, and the intangible feeling of spring in
the air. That sense of dread, of impending misfortune,
which had been for a short time almost
unbearable, was lulled to sleep as by an opiate. She
did not think of the past or the future, she simply
drifted from day to day, and each of these was
pleasanter than the last.

For one thing, she had grown hardened, indifferent
almost to the constant meeting with Paul
Halleck. She had kept her word and obtained for
him all the invitations in her power, until he no
longer needed her help. He was a great success.
Mrs. Van Antwerp's informal little musicale had
been only the first of a series of more elaborate
ones, at which Halleck was often the chief attraction.
Young girls admired him extremely. Elizabeth
could hear him talking to them, just as he had
once talked to her, about Swinburne and Rossetti
and the last word in Art, and she saw that, like
herself, they thought him very brilliant. It was an
admiration which had tangible results, since it led
to an interest in music, and a desire to take singing-lessons
from the talented young barytone. Before
long, he took a studio in Carnegie, near D'Hauteville's,
and furnished it luxuriously, on the strength
of his new prosperity. He was very much the
fashion and absorbed in his success, and seldom had
the time, or perhaps the inclination, to encounter
Elizabeth's unflattering indifference. So for the
most part he left her alone, to her intense relief.
206

One incident, a chance word, in a retrospect of
that time, afterwards stood out in Elizabeth's mind,
though at the moment it seemed to make but a
slight impression.

It was one Sunday afternoon when a number of
people, Paul Halleck among them, had dropped in
to afternoon tea, and the conversation happened to
turn upon palmistry. Elizabeth did not proffer her
own experience. She listened silently to what the
others said on the subject.

"I can't say I have implicit faith in it," observed
Mrs. Bobby. "I was told by a fortune-teller that
I should marry a dark man, who would beat me and
treat me horribly; and as you see, I've married a
fair man&mdash;who treats me pretty well on the whole."

Bobby, who was leaning against the mantel-piece
his tea-cup in his hand, smiled serenely.

"Don't boast too soon, Eleanor," he said, lazily,
"there's no knowing what brutal tendencies I may
develop yet."

Mrs. Hartington, who was seated near him on a
low chair, looked up into his face with a sympathetic
smile. "Are you one of those long-suffering husbands
who turn at last, Mr. Van Antwerp?" she
asked, sweetly. "It would be good discipline, I
think, for Eleanor not to have her own way
always."

Bobby looked down at her coolly for a moment
with his calm blue eyes. "No doubt, it would be
good discipline for all of us, Mrs. Hartington," he
said, in his pleasant, clear-cut tones, "but as my
207
wife's way and mine are generally the same, I'm
afraid I'm not likely to inflict it."

Mrs. Hartington looked down with an injured
air, adding another to her list of grievances against
her dear friend and neighbor, Eleanor Van Antwerp.

"I should never go to a common fortune-teller,
my dear," she observed in a louder tone, for the
benefit of the assembled company. "Yours was
probably just an ignorant person. But I did go to
&mdash;&mdash;, who, you know, charges a small fortune,
and he told me the most extraordinary things. I
have perfect confidence in him; every one I know
thinks him quite infallible."

"Do they?" said Paul Halleck, suddenly turning
from the piano. He shrugged his shoulders. "I
devoutly hope you are mistaken," he said. "&mdash;&mdash;
read my hand in Paris, and told me some very unpleasant
things; among others that I was probably
destined to a violent death. This year of my life, by
the way&mdash;the twenty-seventh&mdash;was to be my fatal
year."

He spoke half laughingly, but the words produced
an effect. There was a general exclamation of
horror, and Elizabeth, who was pouring tea, dropped
the cup that she held in her hand. Julian Gerard,
who was standing behind her, bent down to recover
the fragments.

"It's odd," he said, as he placed them absently
on the table, "his year of danger and yours seem to
correspond." The words rose involuntarily to his
lips, and an instant later he wished them unspoken.
208

She flushed a little, then grew pale. "Oh, I'm
sorry you remembered that nonsense," she said. "I
don't really believe in these things." But her hand
trembled as she poured out the tea, glancing furtively
at Halleck as she did so.

He was enjoying the sensation that his announcement
had created. "Yes," he was saying, "if I
live to be a year older, I am safe; but till then&mdash;Heaven
knows what danger threatens me!" He
shrugged his shoulders with a light laugh. The
prediction did not seem to trouble him greatly.
Elizabeth wondered if he had not invented it, for
the sake of the effect. And then, involuntarily, the
thought crossed her mind&mdash;what if it were really
true, and the prediction were fulfilled? Such things
had been known to happen&mdash;there might be something
in it.... Quick as lightning the thought
flashed through her mind of all that his death might
mean to her&mdash;the merciful release, the solution of
all difficulties.... Just for a moment the idea
lingered, while the others talked, and she shuddered.

"You are quite pale," said Gerard, fixing his
eyes upon her. He was still sensitive to any sign
of feeling which Halleck seemed to arouse in her.
"I believe you are really superstitious. These things
seem to frighten you."

"Am I superstitious?" She looked up at him
dreamily. "Perhaps I am. It would be nice, I
think, if there were something in it, if one could tell
what is going to happen. One could act accordingly.
I should like, for instance"&mdash;her voice sank&mdash;"I
209
should like to look into the future one year,
and see what fate has in store for me."

"If I had any control over fate"&mdash;Gerard
crushed back the impetuous words that followed.
Not yet&mdash;the moment was not propitious. Besides,
he was not sure of her. There was still at times
something in her manner that was baffling, uncertain.&mdash;And
just then Paul Halleck sauntered up and
bent over her in that intimate manner which still
annoyed Gerard's fastidious taste, even though he
had long since convinced himself that he had no
cause to fear him as a rival.

"Did you hear &mdash;&mdash;'s terrible prediction, Miss
Van Vorst?" Paul asked, smiling, "and aren't you
sorry for my untimely fate?"


210

Chapter XXIII


"Why will you never play for me?"

Gerard stood leaning on the piano,
his eyes half smiling, yet with a look
of mastery, fixed upon Elizabeth. She was sitting
in a low chair by the fire, the book on her lap which
she had been reading when he came in. It was a
stormy March afternoon, and the dusk was closing
in prematurely. The room was already in
shadow, except where the firelight formed a little
circle of radiance, illumining Elizabeth's face
and hair. Seated thus in the full glow of light,
with the shadows in the foreground, all the little
details of her appearance&mdash;the broad sweep of rippling
hair on her forehead, the soft laces at her
throat, the pale, dull green of her gown, even to
the buckle on her slipper, and the one white rose in
her belt&mdash;each trifling part of the harmonious
whole, impressed itself on his memory, haunting
him afterwards with a keen sense of pain.

She looked up at him now from under her long
lashes, with the old light in her eyes, half defiant,
half tantalizing&mdash;that spirit of revolt which still
glanced forth at times to baffle and disturb him.
211

"I don't want to play this afternoon. I don't&mdash;feel
in the mood."

"You are never in the mood when I ask you."
Silence. "Confess at once," said Gerard, with
some heat&mdash;"for it would really be quite as civil&mdash;that
you don't wish to play for me."

Another swift upward glance. "Perhaps I
don't"&mdash;demurely.&mdash;"You're too severe a critic."

"You know," said Gerard, "that that is not the
reason."

Silence again. "Will you tell me the reason?"
he asked.

She answered him this time with a flash of defiance.
"I don't know," she said, "what right you
have to demand it. But if you insist upon it, I'll
tell you. You&mdash;you don't like my playing, and&mdash;it's
very absurd, of course, but I never can play for
people who don't."

"I&mdash;don't like your playing?" He shielded his
eyes for a moment, as if from the glare of the fire.
When he spoke again his tone was peremptory.
"You foolish child," he said, "come and play for
me, and I'll tell you, afterwards, what I think of
it."

She looked up at him&mdash;startled, rebellious, met
his eyes for a moment, then rose, pouting, like the
child that he called her, constrained against her will,
put down her book, and moved slowly toward the
piano. "You are so terribly determined," she complained.

"And you are so terribly perverse! But when I
212
want a thing very much, I can be determined, as
you say. Play me the Fire-music," he went on,
"and&mdash;and 'Tristan and Isolde,' as you did&mdash;do
you remember?&mdash;the first night I met you."

She paused, with her hands on the keys. "I&mdash;I
thought,"&mdash;she began, and then broke off suddenly,
and began to play as he bade her&mdash;at first
faltering, uncertainly, with a strange hesitation;
then more firmly, as the keys responded with the old
readiness to her touch, and she lost herself in the
music. Outside the storm increased, the rain beat
against the windows, the room grew dark, and once
Elizabeth paused&mdash;she could hardly see the keys.
But Gerard murmured, "Ah, the love-music!" and
she played on. All the terrible distress, the maddening
perplexity, of the last few months seemed
to express themselves, in spite of herself, in those
surging, strenuous chords; all the hope, too, and
the wild unreasoning happiness. She was startled,
almost as if she were telling the whole story in language
so eloquent that he must surely understand
it without further words. But Gerard, as was natural,
read into it only his own feelings. He stood
leaning on the piano, his hand shielding his eyes,
which were fixed intently upon her.&mdash;It was so dark
now that he could hardly see her face, only the
shimmer of her hair standing out against the dusk,
the movement of her white hands on the keys.

She faltered at last, struck a false chord, and
broke off in the very midst of the love-music. "I&mdash;I
can't see," she murmured, and let her hands fall
in her lap.
213

"Do you remember," Gerard said, "that first
night you played? I had talked to you at dinner,
you know, you&mdash;you repelled me a little. I thought&mdash;I
am telling you the bare truth, you see&mdash;you
were a little cynical, a little hard&mdash;it seemed a pity
when you were so"&mdash;he paused for a moment and
his voice softened as he lingered over the word&mdash;"so
beautiful. I couldn't understand you. I
thought&mdash;I wouldn't try. It wasn't worth while&mdash;most
things were not. And then&mdash;you played"&mdash;He
paused again for a moment. "You know what
most girls' playing is like. Yours has a soul, a
fire&mdash;I don't know where you get it. It moved me,
set me thinking, as no other woman's playing has
done for years."

He paused again. Elizabeth looked up quickly.
"I thought," she murmured, "that you didn't like
my playing, that you were bored"&mdash;

"Ah, you thought," he said, "that when a man
feels very much, he can make pretty speeches? I
can't, at least. Oh, I've no doubt"&mdash;he made a
resigned gesture&mdash;"I've no doubt that I behaved like
a brute. Women have told me that I generally do.
I said to myself&mdash;that girl is dangerous, she could
make a man fall in love with her&mdash;even against his
will. I was in love once&mdash;but that's another story.
I never wanted to repeat the experiment. And so,
as you know, I avoided you; like a fool, I used to
go and look at your picture, and then&mdash;keep away
from you, evening after evening. I struggled&mdash;with
all the strength I have&mdash;I struggled not to
love you. And then, as you know"&mdash;he looked her
214
straight in the eyes&mdash;"as you have known well these
last few weeks,&mdash;I failed."

There was silence for a moment. She was very
white, her hands were tightly clasped in her lap.
"I"&mdash;she gave a little shuddering sigh&mdash;"it would
have been better if you hadn't."

"Elizabeth!" She felt rather than saw how his
face changed. "Elizabeth," he said, hoarsely, "do
you mean that? Then"&mdash;as she sat silent&mdash;"you
don't love me?"

Oh, for the strength to answer "No," and end
this scene&mdash;this useless, perplexing scene, which she
should have been prepared for, which yet seemed
to have come upon her unawares! One firm, courageous
"No," and a man like Gerard would not
ask her twice. Instead, a compromise, useless, feeble,
hovered on her lips. "I&mdash;shouldn't make you
happy," she faltered out, despising her own weakness.

"Is that all?" He laughed out loud in sheer
relief. "My darling,"&mdash;the triumphant tenderness
in his voice was hard to bear&mdash;"don't you think
that I can judge of that?"

She was silent, and he drew nearer to her and
took her hands in his. "You needn't be afraid," he
said. "I shall worship the ground you tread upon,
if&mdash;if you will only consent. You will, Elizabeth,
won't you?" She had not known before that his
voice held tones so caressingly gentle.

For a moment she sat motionless, passive beneath
his touch, and then suddenly: "I can't," she broke
out, hoarsely, drew her hands away from him, and
215
going over to the mantel-piece, she leaned her arms
upon it and hid her face.

When he spoke again, after a long silence, his
voice was entirely changed. "There is something
here I don't understand," he said, coldly. "One
moment you seemed to yield, and the next"&mdash;&mdash;He
made a step towards her. "Tell me the truth,"
he entreated, "don't spare my feelings. It's a false
kindness. You love someone else&mdash;is that it?&mdash;then
tell me so, and I won't reproach you&mdash;or&mdash;trouble
you again."

She turned her face towards him. It was white,
quivering with emotion; but she answered firmly:
"No, you are entirely wrong. There is&mdash;no one
else."

"Not Halleck?" he asked, watching her intently,
his face dark with the old distrust.

She made a quick, involuntary gesture of repulsion.
"Not he&mdash;not he, of all people," she said,
bitterly.

He still eyed her doubtfully, unsatisfied. "You
are sure?" he insisted. "You are telling me the
whole truth? Don't deceive me&mdash;now, Elizabeth;
I could forgive anything but that."

How many chances were given to Elizabeth, only
to be thrown away! She answered him steadily;
"I'm not deceiving you. I tell you frankly that
when I first met Paul Halleck I thought I cared for
him&mdash;he was the first man I had ever known; but
now he is nothing to me, and I have told him so&mdash;I
think I almost dislike him." There was no mistaking
the accent of sincerity in her voice. It was
216
fortunate for Elizabeth, since she was no adept in
lying, that the truth and the falsehood were in this
case so nearly identical.

Gerard was satisfied.

"Then what," he urged, eagerly&mdash;"if there is no
one else&mdash;what stands between us?"

She hesitated. There were voices in the hall,
some visitors requesting admission, the butler parleying
a little&mdash;the discreet, intelligent butler, who
had so considerately refrained, for the last quarter
of an hour, from coming in to light the gas.

Gerard was too absorbed to notice anything outside
of the cause he was pleading. "Tell me," he
repeated, his eyes fixed intently upon her face,
"what stands between us?"

She put out her hand with a deprecating gesture.
That threatening interruption seemed to give her
courage. She was quite herself again. "Can't a
woman hesitate for no definite reason?" she asked.
"You, yourself&mdash;didn't you hesitate&mdash;for reasons
that I must confess seem to me rather vague and&mdash;not
very complimentary."

The argument struck home. He changed color.
"Don't cast that up against me, Elizabeth," he
pleaded. "It's not worthy of you. I told you the
plain truth, badly as it sounds, because it seemed
due to you&mdash;I wanted you to know the worst. And
you must remember that I had no reason to suppose
that you cared, or would ever care, anything
about me. It was only I who suffered when I
kept away from you. But you&mdash;now that you
know how&mdash;how madly I love you&mdash;don't trifle
217
with me&mdash;be generous&mdash;give me a definite answer?"

"But I&mdash;I can't," she returned, in her old wilful
way, "just on the spur of the moment, like this. I
don't want to marry any one&mdash;not just now, at
least. I&mdash;I like my freedom"&mdash;&mdash;

The words died away on her lips. She broke off
suddenly, turning very pale, as the importunate visitor,
whom the butler had vainly endeavored to show
into another room, drew aside the portière and
entered brusquely. It was Paul Halleck. He had
a strangely excited look, which increased as he surveyed
the two people on the hearth-rug, whom he
had evidently interrupted at a critical moment.

To one of them, at least, his entrance was most
unwelcome. Not all of Gerard's carefully cultivated
self-control could avail to hide his annoyance;
he uttered under his breath an angry exclamation,
and going over to the piano, stood moodily turning
over sheets of music. Elizabeth, to whom Paul's
appearance was for some reasons still more disconcerting,
showed greater self-possession. She held
out her hand coldly, but composedly, with a few
mechanical words, to which he barely responded.
There was an embarrassing pause, broken by the
butler, who made his belated, majestic entry, lighted
the chandeliers and drew the curtains. The effect
of the illumination was startling, as it threw into
strong relief the look of agitation on each of their
faces.

"It&mdash;it's storming still, isn't it?" said Elizabeth,
and then remembered that she had asked the same
218
question already. Gerard started up and reflecting
gloomily that it was of no use to try to "stay that
fellow out," he took his leave. Paul and Elizabeth
were left alone.

His presence seemed a matter of absolute indifference
to Elizabeth, who sank again into the low
chair by the fire, and picking up the book she had
laid down, turned over its pages with an air of icy
unconcern. He came and stood beside her, leaning
against the mantel-piece, a look of brutality on
his handsome face.

"So," he said. "I've driven Gerard away. A
case of 'two is company,' evidently."

Her expression did not change. "Oh, he had
been here some time," she said, coldly. "No doubt
he meant to leave in any case."

"Oh, no doubt." He sneered angrily. "Do you
know what I heard to-day?" he went on. "I heard
that you were engaged to him."

She flushed a little. "Did you?" she said, and
then, quietly: "But that means nothing, you know."

"But you are together all the time. I can't come
to the house without meeting him. You encourage
him, accept his flowers, lead him on.&mdash;Pray, how
long is this sort of thing going to last?"

They eyed each other for a moment, he flushed
with anger, she cold and hard. "You have no
right," she said, icily, "to ask an account of my
actions."

"No right!" he repeated, as if thunder-struck.
"I should like to know who has a better."
219

"No right that I acknowledge, at least," she
amended her first sentence.

He paced up and down the room, struggling for
self-control. "Whether you acknowledge it or
not, is immaterial," he said, stopping suddenly in
front of her. "I claim it, and that is enough. You
must give up this infernal flirtation with Gerard,
or"&mdash;&mdash;

"Or what?" she insisted haughtily, as he paused.

"I shall go to Gerard at once and tell him the
truth," he concluded, defiantly.

Dead silence. The book she held fell from Elizabeth's
nerveless hand. The steady ticking of the
clock in the stillness seemed to beat an accompaniment
to these words: "Don't deceive me&mdash;now,
Elizabeth; I could forgive anything but that."

"Paul?" Her voice was no longer icy, but soft,
with caressing tones. "Paul, you wouldn't be so
unkind?"

"What difference does it make to you?" he said,
eyeing her keenly, "whether I tell Gerard or
not? You can't marry him, you know&mdash;it's impossible."

"I don't want to marry him," she said, gathering
all her powers of resistance, "but&mdash;he's a friend of
mine. I don't want him to be told things about me
by&mdash;an outsider."

"Ah, you call me that!" he said, his anger roused
again. "Well, outsider or not, I hold the cards. I
shall go to Gerard at once and tell him that we
were married&mdash;at Cranston, last July. If he doubts
220
my assertion, the record is there, and it won't be
very hard for him to verify it."

Silence again. Elizabeth sat musing, her brows
knit, her under lip slightly thrust out, in a fashion
that seemed to express all the obstinate resolve of
her nature. "I will do as you wish, if you will
keep silent."

"Will you write a note to Gerard," Paul demanded,
"sending him away?"

"No," she said, sullenly. "I won't do that."

"Then there is nothing else you can do," he declared.

Elizabeth mused again. "I would give&mdash;money,"
she said. The last word was spoken very
low.

He started and flushed. "Do you want to bribe
me?" he asked, angrily.

She shrugged her shoulders. "I am quite aware
that you will not do anything for nothing," she said.

Paul fell again to pacing up and down the room.
His face showed traces of a mental struggle. Elizabeth
watched him from the corners of her eyes;
she saw that her offer tempted him more than she
had dared to hope.

He stopped at last in front of her. "How much
can you spare?" he asked, in a voice in which a
certain bravado strove to gain the mastery over
inward uneasiness and shame. "The truth is, I
am most confoundedly hard up just now, what with
furnishing the studio and everything, and if you
could help me a little, it would be very convenient.
221
I can pay you back later with interest a hundred
times."

"I have told you," she said, coldly, "what payment
I want."

He shrugged his shoulders, with an attempt at
nonchalance. "Oh, as to that, I never really intended
to tell Gerard." Elizabeth's lip curled.

"How much money do you want?" she asked,
curtly. "A hundred? Two hundred?" Her
ideas on such matters were vague. Paul's face fell.

"I should need five hundred at least, if&mdash;if it is
to be of any use," he said, gloomily.

It was more than she expected, but she showed
no signs of flinching. "Five hundred, then," she
said, rising as if to conclude the interview. "Will
it do, if I let you have it to-morrow?"

"Perfectly. Elizabeth, you are an angel. I
can't thank you enough." He advanced towards
her with outstretched arms, but with a gesture of
repulsion she waved him aside.

"Don't thank me," she said, coldly. "This is a
bargain for our mutual advantage. I will fulfil
my share of it if you remember yours. And now,
as we have nothing more to discuss, I think I will
ask you to excuse me." She made him a stately
inclination, picked up her book and sailed from the
room in undiminished dignity and apparent unconcern.

But when she was alone and had locked herself
into her room to think over her misery, then, indeed,
the situation stared her in the face in its true colors.
222
Her own words, "I like my freedom," rang mockingly
in her ears. She was not free, but a slave;
slave of a man who had her in his power, and would
use it, as time went on, more and more unscrupulously.
This time it was five hundred that he demanded;
next time it would be a thousand. What
could she do? Somehow or another, he must be
satisfied. Anything was better, any sacrifice, any
humiliation, than to allow him to go to Gerard with
that bare statement of facts, "We were married at
Cranston, last July!" The truth, devoid of any of
the softening evasions by which she cloaked it to
her own mind; the redeeming circumstances which
excused, if they did not justify, her silence.

Her bitterest enemy must admit that the position
was a hard one. A contract entered into hastily by
a thoughtless girl, on the impulse of the moment;
a quarter of an hour in an empty church one summer
day; a few words spoken before a sleepy old
clergyman and indifferent witnesses&mdash;could such
things as these have power to ruin one's whole life?
No, no&mdash;her heart cried out wildly to the contrary.
The whole episode seemed, in the retrospect, so
dream-like. It was easy to imagine that it had
never happened. And yet, had she the courage to
ignore it?... And, even if she had, there was
always Paul to remind her of it, who would not give
her up without a terrible struggle, that must, without
fail, come to Gerard's ears.

There was only one hope that she could see, and
that was wild and irrational; the hope Paul had himself
suggested. If that prediction could be fulfilled!
223
Elizabeth shuddered. It was terrible to think of
such a thing; terrible to obtain one's own happiness
at the cost of another person's life. She did
not really wish Paul dead&mdash;that would be wicked.
And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;the thought pressed irresistibly
upon her&mdash;if it had to be!&mdash;if it had to be! What
a blessed relief&mdash;what an end to all this misery!
"Oh, I do wish it, I do wish it!" she broke out,
speaking aloud, unconsciously. "I would give anything
in this world to hear of his death."

She stopped, startled at the sound of her own
voice. The wish shocked her, even in the moment
of expressing it. Her wishes were so often fulfilled&mdash;she
had an almost superstitious faith in their
efficacy. If this one were fulfilled, what then?&mdash;For
a moment she, thinking it over, balanced possibilities;
and then with a stifled cry, fell on her
knees and hid her face in her hands.

"Oh, I'm growing so wicked," she sobbed out.
"It's because I'm so miserable. Only let me have
what I want, and I'll be different; I'll be the kind of
woman that he admires; only&mdash;I must find a way,
I must have what I want&mdash;first."


224

Chapter XXIV


The next day dawned clear and bright; a
beautiful morning in early spring after a
night of storm. Upon Elizabeth's spirits
as she dressed the weather produced the illogical
effect that it does upon most of us. Reviewed
by daylight, the situation seemed to her
many degrees less desperate. The night before,
there had seemed to her only one way out, and that
a tragical one; but now there were&mdash;there must be&mdash;a
hundred ways, if only she could gain the time to
think of them.

The first thing was to obtain the money; but this
in itself was no easy matter. She had promised it
to Paul as if it were a mere trifle; yet, as a matter
of fact, she was as badly off herself at the time as
was to be expected of a young woman who had gone
out a great deal, and established and lived up to an
expensive reputation for being always well and appropriately
gowned.

She reviewed her resources. Mrs. Bobby would
have lent her the money at once and asked no questions;
but from this course Elizabeth's pride shrank
uncontrollably. She preferred to take a sum she
had just laid aside to satisfy to some extent the
claims of a long-suffering and complaisant dressmaker;
225
but even with this sacrifice determined on,
she was still far short of the amount required. She
took out, in desperation, her various jewels and
trinkets, and looked them over, wondering how
much they were worth. There were many pretty
things her aunts had given her, none of them probably
of any great intrinsic value, and there were the
beautiful gifts that Mrs. Bobby had showered upon
her; and, finally, there was the string of pearls
which she always wore about her neck, one of
the few heirlooms which old Madam Van Vorst had
once kept under lock and key, and which her daughters
had of course made over to Elizabeth. The
girl stood now hesitating with the pearls in her
hand. She had worn them to every ball that winter,
she was wont to say, with her half-joking, half-real
touch of superstition, that they brought her
luck; as if, with their possession, something of the
spirit of that proud beauty of a by-gone day had
entered into her, enabling her to conquer the world
in which the older woman had been naturally at
home. Would the power leave her with the pearls?
The fantastic thought lingered for a moment, and
then impatiently she thrust it aside, and put the
precious heirloom in with the rest of her possessions,
which she had resolved to sacrifice. It was not a
moment when she could afford to dally with sentiment.

Yet what a strange, disreputable proceeding it
seemed! She was haunted with a vague sense of
losing caste, as she took her trinkets to one of the
smaller jewelry-shops, and faltered out her improbable
226
tale of their being unbecoming and of no use
to her. The jeweler, well used to the straits of
fashionable young women, listened without a smile,
and offered her on the whole a fair price, though it
was much less than she expected. There was nothing
that she was not obliged to part with&mdash;from the
jeweled watch which Mrs. Bobby had given her at
Christmas, to the pearls, which proved to be the
most valuable of all. When she left the shop she
had deprived herself of all her ornaments, but she
held the necessary bribe in her hand, and as the
simplest way of conveying it to Halleck, she got on
a cable car and went up at once to his studio at
Carnegie. There was nothing startling in the proceeding,
for he had now a number of pupils, who
came to him at his studio; and though the girls
whom Elizabeth knew always brought their maids,
or a chaperone of some sort, she was not in the
mood to waste much thought on conventionalities.
Her one idea was to fulfil her share of the bargain
before he should, perchance, have repented of his,
and she did not think of the chance of meeting any
one. Her own affairs had reached a crisis which
blinded her to the fact that to other people, the
world was progressing peacefully, in the usual order
of events.

This dream-like state of indifference to all but the
one anxiety continued till she reached Carnegie and
was borne up in the elevator to Paul's studio, which
was directly opposite to Mr. D'Hauteville's. And
here, for the first time, she paused, seized by a sudden
panic. From behind the closed curtain at the
227
end of the small vestibule, there came the sound of
a woman's voice, strained, nasal, raised high in
what seemed a tirade of denunciation. To Elizabeth's
mind, as she heard it, there arose an involuntary
recollection of Bassett Mills, and of the
gaudy little parlor behind her aunt's shop, and some
bitter words directed against herself, in what seemed
a past period of her history. She stood hesitating,
terrified; then the curtain was pushed aside, and a
woman came out. It was her cousin Amanda.
Her face was white and set, her eyes blazing. She
stared at Elizabeth for a moment as if dazed, then
brushed past her without a word.

Paul stood on the threshold, a picturesque object
in his velveteen coat and turned-down collar, against
the artistic background of the luxuriously-furnished
studio. He looked flushed, annoyed; the scene
which had just taken place had evidently been a
trying one. But when he saw Elizabeth standing
doubtful in the hall, his face cleared and he came
forward to greet her with effusion.

"Darling, how good of you to come here!" He
evidently hailed the visit as an overture towards
reconciliation. She hastened to disabuse him.

"It was the easiest way to bring this," she said,
handing him the package which she had clasped
nervously all the way up. "Will you be kind
enough, please, to count it and see if it is all right?"
It was impossible to speak with more icy brevity, or
to impart to any proceeding a more severely business-like
air.

He flushed uncomfortably, but did not allow his
228
vexation to interfere with the evident necessity of
counting the money. "It is all right," he said, biting
his lips, as he put down the last roll of bills.
"Do you wish me to give you a receipt?" he asked,
with fine sarcasm.

"No," said Elizabeth, gravely. "I rely on your
word."

Paul bowed. "Thank you," he said. "And
now&mdash;is there anything else I can do for you?"

"Nothing," said Elizabeth, briefly, "except what
you know already. And now, I must go." She
moved towards the door, but he placed himself in
her way.

"Come, come, Elizabeth," he said. "I'm not
going to let you go like that&mdash;the first time you
make me a visit. Give me a kiss now, just to show
that you don't bear malice."

Elizabeth's only reply was a look of ineffable
haughtiness. "Will you let me pass, please?" she
said, in a low tone of concentrated wrath, and with
an uneasy laugh, he obeyed her.

"What a virago you are!" he said, "almost as
bad as your cousin Amanda. It must be the hair,"
he added, with a sneer, but Elizabeth did not pause
to reply. Anxious only to escape, she closed the
studio door hastily behind her, and a moment later
the elevator bore her swiftly down, and she regained
the street, with the feeling of having staved off misfortune,
for the moment at least.

She found, when she got home, a note from Gerard,
informing her that he had been unexpectedly
called out of town for a few days on business, but
229
hoped to see her on his return. There were the
flowers, too, which he sent her daily. He had no
intention, evidently, of taking her answer of the
day before as final. She realized this, with a thrill
that held in it more of pleasure than alarm. Still,
she was glad that he was out of town. His absence
was a reprieve, giving her more of the time
she wanted, though it is hard to say what she expected
to gain by it. But very little often sufficed
to restore Elizabeth's spirits. She was going out to
dinner that evening, and she dressed for it with a
mind that was comparatively at ease.

But poor Elizabeth's moments of tranquillity just
then were short. She was nearly dressed when Celeste
entered with the information that a young person
had called to see Mademoiselle, who insisted
upon seeing her at once. "I told her that Mademoiselle
is dressing," said the maid, with expressive
gestures; "that she has an engagement, it is most
important, but&mdash;but she is a most determined young
person, she insists that I bring up a message at
once."

"It is Amanda, of course," thought Elizabeth,
with a terrible sinking of the heart. She had forgotten,
until that moment, the meeting in the studio.
She glanced at the clock. "I have fifteen minutes,
Celeste," she said. "Show her up. She may want
to see me about something important." The maid
departed, and Elizabeth bent down nervously to sort
out gloves and handkerchief, wondering as she did
now at each unexpected incident, what danger it
might portend.
230

"I thought," said Amanda, "I might come up&mdash;seeing
we're first cousins." She stood in the door-way,
her eyes roaming about the room, taking in
every detail&mdash;the soft prevailing harmonies of pale
blue and rose, the firelight flickering on the tiled
hearth, the shining silver ornaments on the dressing-table,
the profusion of bric-à-brac, of cotillion
favors, the roses in the china bowl, the general air
of luxury&mdash;all a fit setting to the proud young
beauty, standing before the mirror in her shimmering
white satin and laces.

"My, but you look fine!" said Amanda, under
her breath. A slightly awed expression crossed her
face, modifying the assurance of her entrance.
"You're going out?" she asked, looking almost
ready to retreat.

"To dinner&mdash;yes; but not just yet. Won't you
sit down, Amanda?" Elizabeth said, trying to speak
easily. "I&mdash;I'm glad to see you. How is Aunt
Rebecca, and&mdash;every one at Bassett Mills?"

Amanda sat down, her eyes still wandering
eagerly around the room. Elizabeth, looking at her,
saw the unfavorable change that a few months had
made. True, she was smartly dressed, with the
cheap, tawdry smartness that can be bought ready-made
at the shops, and her hat was tilted carefully
at the fashionable angle; her hair, growing low
about her forehead, had still the pretty, natural wave
to it, which was a legacy from the fever, and the
general effect at a first glance was striking. But
the face, under the jaunty, be-feathered hat, was
231
white and haggard, the eyes had a wild restless look,
there were hard, vindictive lines about the mouth.
Her hands moved incessantly, plucking at the fringe
on her gown.

"Glad? Well, I guess you're not very glad to
see me," she said, with a strange, mocking smile,
ignoring the latter part of Elizabeth's speech.
"There never was much love lost between us, and
now&mdash;but still I thought I'd pay you a visit. I'm
staying with Uncle Ben's folks, and they told me I
ought to look up my swell cousin&mdash;since you were
so sure to want to see me"&mdash;she gave a short, jarring
laugh. "That stuck-up maid wouldn't believe
me&mdash;thought I was crazy, when I said we
were first cousins. I don't see why&mdash;I'm sure I
don't look so&mdash;so different as all that." Her voice
sank into rather a wistful key, and she stole a glance
at the long pier-glass that stood opposite her. "I
got my suit at a bargain sale," she said. "The girls
said it was&mdash;real stylish."

"It's very pretty," said Elizabeth, gently. She
glanced at Amanda with a sudden pity that overpowered
her first annoyance and alarm at the inopportune
visit. What had brought her to town?
Some vague, irrational hope of winning back Paul's
admiration, perhaps, with this gown that was "real
stylish," and the new hat, and the general, tawdry
attempt at smartness. It was that, probably, which
had taken her to the studio, and no doubt Paul had
been disgusted with this attempt to revive an old
flirtation, and in his irritation, had convinced her
232
somewhat rudely of his indifference. Poor
Amanda! Really she had not seemed quite right in
the head since the fever.

"Were you surprised to see me this morning?"
said Amanda, watching her and seeming to read
her thoughts. "I went to call on another old friend,
and&mdash;I wasn't welcome"&mdash;she gave another jarring
laugh, which ended this time in a sob. "He&mdash;he
didn't seem glad to see me, considering how well he
used to know me&mdash;once." Her voice broke piteously,
she paused for a moment, and then: "I hate
him, I hate him!" she broke out, fiercely. "I'd
give anything in this world if I'd never known
him."

"So would I," said Elizabeth, low and bitterly,
and then stopped, frightened at what she had said.
But Amanda showed no surprise.

"Ah, you think that now," she said, slowly, "but
you didn't use to. You've got so many rich beaux
now that you don't care about him any longer. But
I wonder what they'd think&mdash;these rich beaux of
yours&mdash;if they knew how wild you used to be about
him, how you went wandering about the country
with him, if they knew"&mdash;Amanda leaned forward
and spoke in an impressive whisper&mdash;"if they knew
that you have to do what he wants now, that you're
afraid of him."

There was a silence. Elizabeth, faint and giddy,
sank into the nearest chair, and put up involuntarily
her hand to her heart. So here was another danger
threatening, another person who knew something&mdash;everything,
perhaps? Her brain reeled. Amanda
233
leaned back in her chair, watching her triumphantly,
a hard, bright glitter in her eyes.

"Amanda!" Elizabeth's white lips tried in vain
to frame a coherent question. "Amanda,"&mdash;she
made another attempt&mdash;"what do you mean?"

Amanda smiled contemptuously. "Oh, you
know well enough what I mean," she said. "Why
did you go there this morning when you don't care
for him any more, and are sorry you ever knew him,
unless you're afraid of him, and have to do what he
wants?"

"Oh, is that all?" Elizabeth drew a long sigh
of relief. "I went there this morning because&mdash;because
I wanted to meet a friend"&mdash;she broke off
in confusion before the look on Amanda's face.
Then, with a sudden reaction of feeling, she raised
her head haughtily. "It doesn't matter," she said,
"what I went there for. It's a&mdash;a studio; all his
pupils go there. I might have wanted to see him
about singing-lessons, about anything.&mdash;If that is
all you base your suspicions on, Amanda"&mdash;&mdash;She
stopped.

"Ah, but if it isn't?" said Amanda, in her impressive
whisper, which seemed fraught with a mysterious
consciousness of power.

Another silence. The defiant look on Elizabeth's
face faded; she leaned back in her chair and half
closed her eyes. Ah, she was weary, deathly weary,
of these constant nervous shocks. How much did
Amanda know&mdash;how much? If she could only be
sure!

"I think they'd be rather surprised," Amanda
234
went on, in unnaturally quiet tones, "these swell
friends of yours, if they knew all about you. They
think you very sweet, they give you lots of things"&mdash;Amanda's
hard, restless eyes roamed again about
the room and rested on Elizabeth's beautiful gown.
"It don't seem fair," she broke out, suddenly, with
a fierce little sob; "it don't seem fair, that you
should have so much&mdash;and then to be so pretty too,
as well as all the rest!"

She was silent for a moment, struggling with the
tears that threatened to break forth, and Elizabeth
began to breathe more freely. All this bluster, after
all, these vague threats, seemed to resolve themselves
into the old, unreasoning, powerless jealousy&mdash;nothing
more. And with the relief came again
the sense of pity, of a certain justice in Amanda's
point of view.

"It isn't fair," she said, softly. "I don't deserve
it, but"&mdash;&mdash;

"Well, fair or not, I guess it don't make much
difference," Amanda interrupted her, drearily, rising
to her feet. "You've always had the best of
me, and probably, you always will. But, if ever you
don't"&mdash;&mdash;She broke off suddenly and moved
towards the door. "I guess I'd better be going,"
she said. "You'll be late for your dinner. Only,
before you go"&mdash;she paused with her hand on the
knob of the door, that hard, mocking glitter in her
eyes&mdash;"before you go, just put on some of your
jewelry, won't you? Seems to me you look sort of
bare without it."

"My&mdash;my jewelry?" Elizabeth's heart, which
235
had been beating more quietly, suddenly stood still.
"I&mdash;I don't wear jewelry, Amanda," she said, in a
dull, toneless voice.

"What, not your pearls?" Amanda's hard,
mocking eyes seemed to read her through and
through. "Your pearls you were so proud of in
the country, that you said you'd always wear. Seems
to me you need them&mdash;with that fine dress!"

She stood hovering by the door, a weird figure in
the exaggerated smartness of her attire, with her
white face framed in the deep red hair, and that
strange, uncanny smile gleaming across it, lighting
it up into an elf-like suggestion of mysterious
power. Elizabeth stared at her helplessly, fascinated;
then, with a great effort, she roused herself
and hurried towards her.

"Amanda!" she cried, desperately. "Amanda,
for Heaven's sake, stop these insinuations! Tell me
plainly what you mean?" She gripped her fiercely
by the arm, her face was white and set. For a
moment Amanda's eyes met hers. Then, as if in
spite of herself, they fell, she freed herself sullenly
from Elizabeth's grasp.

"Well, I guess I didn't mean much," she said,
awkwardly, "or if I did, it don't matter. I wouldn't
tell tales against&mdash;my first cousin"&mdash;She turned the
knob of the door, but again she paused, that weird
smile still flickering in her eyes. "Good-night,"
she said, "I hope you'll enjoy your dinner. Too
bad you haven't got your pearls." She gave
one last jarring laugh, opened the door and went
out.
236

Elizabeth, white and trembling, sank into the
nearest chair.

"How she frightened me!" she gasped out.
"These constant shocks will kill me. Does she
know anything definite? Probably not. But what
can I do, how can I find out?&mdash;Ah, Celeste!"&mdash;as
the maid appeared with an anxious expression in
the door-way. "The carriage is waiting? Very
well." She hurried to the dressing-table, caught up
her gloves and gave one hasty glance at her white
face. "How ugly I am growing," she thought,
turning away with a shudder; "quite like Amanda!
I see the resemblance. It is this awful life. I wish&mdash;oh,
how I wish I were home!" The thought
swept over her, thrilling her with an intense, passionate
longing for her aunts' presence, for the
country quiet, for rest and peace.

"Yes, I will go home," she thought, as Celeste
adjusted the cloak about her shoulders and she hastened
down to the carriage. "I will go home," she
repeated to herself at intervals during the evening,
while she talked and laughed with a restless light
in her eyes and a feverish flush on her cheeks.
"The country will be so peaceful. I shall be quite
safe there, away from all this agitation, this trying
to keep up appearances. It is the best way out.
How fortunate that he is away! I won't see him
again before I go."

It was, she felt, an heroic resolution. Yes, she
would go at once. And she resolutely crushed back
the thought: "He will follow."


237

Chapter XXV


"The Van Antwerps have come up for the
summer," said Miss Joanna, who had
made the same announcement, if you
remember, not quite a year before. "The butcher
says they came last night. They never got here so
early before."

Elizabeth, who was arranging flowers, looked up
suddenly. "Yes, I know," she said, quietly,
"Eleanor wrote me." She left her roses half arranged,
and wandered restlessly over to the long
French window. Before her stretched the well-kept
lawn, with its flower-beds and rose-bushes and beyond,
field and wooded upland, all clothed in their
newest, most vivid dress of green; further still the
river, with the white sails on its surface&mdash;that river
from which, more than half a century before, another
Elizabeth Van Vorst had resolutely turned
away her eyes, refusing to be reminded of the life
that she had given up. But that woman of an
older generation was made of sterner stuff, perhaps,
than her grand-daughter. And then there was not
much travel in those days, no daily mails, no guests
coming up to neighboring house-parties over Sunday....
"It will be nice for you, Elizabeth, to have
Mrs. Bobby," said Aunt Joanna, in her comfortable
238
monotone, her knitting-needles clicking peacefully.
"You have found it a little dull, you know, dear,
since you came back."

A little dull! Elizabeth could have laughed out
loud at the words. A little dull&mdash;with such exciting
subjects to discuss as the new Easter anthem, and
the latest illness of the Rectory children; with such
diversions as a drive to Bassett Mills, a tea-party at
the Courtenays! ...

"If I am dull," she said, turning round presently
with the ghost of a smile "It certainly isn't the fault
of the Neighborhood. I didn't tell you that Mrs.
Courtenay has asked me to tea&mdash;a third time. She
says 'Frank will see me home&mdash;no need to send the
carriage.'" She laughed a little, not without a shade
of bitterness. "Fancy Mrs. Courtenay suggesting
that&mdash;last summer!"

"Well, dear, she means well, I suppose," said
Miss Joanna, puzzled but kindly. Miss Cornelia
raised her head with a little, involuntary touch of
pride.

"The Courtenays are&mdash;are really quite pushing,
I think," she said, a most unwonted tone of asperity
in her voice. "I told Mrs. Courtenay, Elizabeth,
that you had been so very gay"&mdash;with emphasis&mdash;"you
really needed a complete rest."

Elizabeth laughed. "And of course," she said
"that only made her&mdash;dear good woman!&mdash;all the
more anxious to provide me with a little more
amusement. I never realized before how fond the
girls have always been of me. But then that's the
case, apparently with the whole Neighborhood. They
239
always concealed their affection for me very successfully&mdash;until
this spring!"

She paused, her aunts made no reply. She went
over to the piano and began absently turning over
sheets of music.

"Do you remember, auntie," she said, abruptly&mdash;Miss
Joanna had left the room in response to a summons
from the maid, and Elizabeth and Miss Cornelia
were alone&mdash;"do you remember that I told you
once that I felt myself a sort of nondescript&mdash;neither
flesh, fowl, nor good red herring? But now I seem
to be considered a very fine fowl indeed&mdash;the ugly
duckling, probably, that turned into a swan."

"You never were an ugly duckling, my dear,"
Miss Cornelia could not help protesting, in spite
of her principles. "It certainly wasn't that."

"Perhaps not," said Elizabeth, "at all events, I'm
no better-looking than I was&mdash;let us say, last year.
I heard a woman at The Mills say the other day
that I had "gone off terrible," in my looks. But
that doesn't prevent Frank Courtenay from coming
here day after day, boring me to death, since he
has discovered as his mother tells me, that I am
"just the style that he admires"&mdash;it doesn't prevent
the Johnston girls from going into raptures over my
beautiful hair, and asking if I mind their copying
my lovely gowns. They have copied my new spring
hat, if you notice. Oh, it would be amusing, if it
wasn't&mdash;so very petty!" She put out her hand with
a weary, contemptuous gesture. "And then the
funny part of it all is that I am not really so nice,
if they only knew it, as I was last year, when they
240
all treated me as if I had committed some sort of
crime, merely in existing."

"My dear," remonstrated Miss Cornelia, "how
can you talk like that? I'm sure you're not a bit
spoiled&mdash;every one says so."

"Ah, they think so," said Elizabeth, quickly,
"they think me nice, because I've acquired a society
manner, and say the correct thing, but if they
knew&mdash;everything"&mdash;she stopped suddenly and
stood for a moment staring steadily before her, with
knit brows. "Do you know, Aunt Cornelia," she
said abruptly "what I think I am?&mdash;a sort of moral
nondescript, neither good nor bad. I see the right
way&mdash;oh, I see it so very plainly, and I want to take
it; and then I choose the wrong&mdash;always and inevitably
I choose the wrong, and shall all my life,
until the end. It's not my fault, really&mdash;I can't do
right, no matter how hard I try."

"My dear!" Miss Cornelia looked at her, puzzled
and shocked. "There's no one," she said, putting
into trite words her own simple conviction "there's
no one, Elizabeth, who can't do right, if they try
hard enough."

"Do you think so, auntie?" said Elizabeth, very
gently. "Then probably I don't try&mdash;hard enough."
She went over to Miss Cornelia and kissed her on
the cheek. "If I were like you," she said, "I
should." Then without further words, she sat down
at the piano and began to play, as she did every
day for hours at a time. Such restless, passionate,
brilliant playing! A vague uneasiness mingled in
Miss Cornelia's mind with her pride in the girl's
241
talent, as she listened to it. Something was troubling
Elizabeth, evidently; something which had brought
her home so unexpectedly, which had changed her
in looks and manner beyond what could be accounted
for by excitement and late hours. Yet innate delicacy
and timidity prevented Miss Cornelia from
forcing in any way the confidence which seemed
to tremble, now and again, upon the girl's lips. She
had a vague idea that the difficulty, whatever it was,
would soon be decided one way or another, that
the Van Antwerps' arrival, which Elizabeth seemed
at once to dread and look forward to, would bring
matters to a crisis, and the whole thing would be
explained.

Elizabeth was still playing when Mrs. Bobby interrupted
her. That she had not allowed a day to
elapse before hastening to the Homestead was a
fact noted with jealous care by the Misses Courtenay,
who met her at the gate.

"He is desperate." Mrs. Bobby's visit had not
lasted many minutes before she murmured this,
holding Elizabeth's hand, and scanning eagerly her
averted face. At Mrs. Bobby's words it quivered,
the color flushed into her cheek; but otherwise she
made no sign.

"When you first went away," Mrs. Bobby continued,
as no answer came, "he was all for coming
up here at once. He thought it a caprice, a morbid,
unaccountable whim; he was sure that if he could
see you, remonstrate with you&mdash;And then there was
your letter, forbidding him to come. He was beside
himself! It was all I could do to keep him
242
from taking the first train up here. I said&mdash;Wait&mdash;it
doesn't do, always, to force a woman's will;
give her a little time. At least she has paid you
the compliment, which she has paid to no one else
of&mdash;running away from your attentions."

She paused, her eyes still eagerly fixed upon
Elizabeth's face. The color in the girl's cheek was
now brilliant, her lips were parted; but still she
did not speak.

"Day after day," said Mrs. Bobby, "we have
talked it over&mdash;he walking up and down, restless,
wild; I trying to soothe him, urging him to be
patient&mdash;Sometimes he thinks that you are revenging
yourself in this way for his former neglect, that
it is a little scheme to pay him back&mdash;the idea drives
him frantic, makes him furious with himself, yet
he is always encouraged when he thinks of it. And
then again&mdash;he thinks that you don't care for him,
that you never will, that there is some one else....
Ah, my dear, if you really do care, you are cruel,
unpardonably cruel, to torment him like this."

Again she paused. Elizabeth, with a quick, impatient
movement, dragged her hand away from her
grasp, and began to pace up and down, gasping
as if for breath. "Cruel," she cried out, "cruel!
And you think it gives me pleasure&mdash;to torment
him!"

"If it doesn't," said Mrs. Bobby, following her
with her eyes and speaking with some coldness, "I
confess I am at a loss to account for your behavior."

Elizabeth stopped suddenly and bending down,
243
almost buried her face in the roses, whose fragrance
she inhaled.

"There never was a man," said Mrs. Bobby,
"who loved a woman more than he loves you, Elizabeth.
And there isn't a man, who, I believe, deserves
a woman better."

"Deserves her!" murmured Elizabeth, "deserves
me! Oh, good Heavens!" The exclamation was
barely audible, and apparently addressed only to the
roses.

"I said to him yesterday," said Mrs. Bobby,
"'You'll come up Saturday, of course?' But&mdash;he's
proud now and hurt, Elizabeth&mdash;he said: 'I won't
come, I won't force myself upon her without&mdash;her
knowledge and consent. If she knows, if she's willing,
why, then, I'll come&mdash;not otherwise.'"

There was a pause. Elizabeth turned presently
a face which seemed to reflect the glowing color of
the roses over which she had bent. "What do you&mdash;want
me to do, Eleanor?" she asked, softly.

"Tell me what I shall say," said Mrs. Bobby "in
the letter which I must write when I get home."
She went over to Elizabeth and put her hand on
her arm. "Shall he come, or shall he not? It
rests with you."

Elizabeth's eyes were again averted. "It isn't for
me, Eleanor," she murmured, "to drive your guests
away, if&mdash;if they really want to come."

And so Mrs. Bobby, when she got home, wrote
her letter. It consisted of only one word.

The Saturday following was extremely warm.
244
The Rector and his wife came to take tea at the
Homestead, and they all sat afterwards in the dimly-lighted
drawing-room. Elizabeth wandered to the
long French window, and stood looking out upon
the moon-lit lawn. "It's so warm that I think I
shall go for a walk," she said, half aloud, but no
one heard her. The Rector was telling Miss Cornelia
about the death of an old clergyman in Cranston,
who had lived alone with two old servants.
Elizabeth stood and listened for a moment to the
deep, impressive tones which mingled strangely with
the comfortable monotone which the Rector's wife
was addressing to Miss Joanna.

"And so," she was saying "you see I have had
blue put on it again, being more summery"&mdash;

"I feel particularly sorry," the Rector's voice
broke in, "for the old servants. They were quite
prostrated, I fear, poor things! They too have not
long to live."

"Black satin at four dollars a yard," said his
wife, "is sure to last forever."

"He was an excellent man," said the Rector.
"His death is a great loss." But here Elizabeth,
weary of listening, softly turned the knob of the
window and stepped out on the lawn.

What a beautiful night it was outside! The long
twilight was fading into dusk, but the moon silvered
the shadows that the trees cast across the road.
Elizabeth walked to the gate and stood leaning
against it. In the distance she heard distinctly the
sound of a horse's hoofs. It grew nearer and nearer,
and in a few moments a man on horseback was
245
beside her, and drew his rein abruptly before this
figure in white, which stood like an apparition in
his path.

"Elizabeth," he said. "Elizabeth, is it you?"

"Did you think it was my ghost?" she asked,
with a soft laugh. Her white gown shimmered in
the moonlight, her hair framed in her face with a
vivid halo, her eyes shone like stars. Gerard sprang
from his horse.

"Elizabeth," he said "were you waiting for me?"

"Yes," she answered, "I was waiting for you."

And the next moment he had her in his arms, and
she had forgotten all other thoughts, all other
claims, beneath the fervor of his kisses.


246

Chapter XXVI


The summer passed for an eventful one at
Bassett Mills, being marked by at least two
subjects of conversation; the one the engagement
of Elizabeth Van Vorst of the Homestead
"that girl of Malvina Jones," to a gentleman from
town, who was reported to be "rolling in wealth;"
the second, the illness of Amanda Jones, of that
fashionable disease called nervous prostration, which
no other girl at Bassett Mills but Amanda, who had
always given herself airs, would have had the time
or the money to indulge in. She had been taken ill
while visiting her relations in New York, and her
mother had gone up to nurse her, and announced on
her return that Amanda was "that nervous" the
doctor&mdash;"the best that could be had," as she observed
with pride, had recommended complete rest,
and sending her to a sanitarium for a few months.

"But there really ain't much the matter with her,"
Amanda's mother explained rather tartly to Elizabeth,
who inquired for particulars as to her cousin's
illness. "She has fits of crying, and then of sitting
still and staring straight before her, like as if she
was in a trance, and then she'll get up, and walk
up and down the room for hours, and sometimes
she'll notice you, and sometimes she won't&mdash;but dear
247
me, it's all nonsense, I say. If she had some hard
work to do, it would be better for her&mdash;but the doctor
didn't seem to think so, and so I let her go to the
sanitarium. No one shall say that I grudge the
expense, as, thank Heaven! I don't have to, though
there ain't another person at The Mills that
wouldn't."

"I'm sure I hope it will do her good," Elizabeth
said, kindly. She felt so glad to have Amanda,
whatever the reason, away from Bassett Mills that
she was conscious of a sudden pang of remorse,
which increased when she received a letter from her
cousin, congratulating her upon her engagement.
It was a perfectly rational letter, with only slight
references to her illness, and none at all to that unpleasant
last interview in town; and Elizabeth answered
the congratulations in the same amicable
spirit in which they were offered, reflecting that,
after all, much of Amanda's peculiarity must be
excused on the ground of her persistent ill-health.
And yet, as she sealed and directed her own letter,
she breathed again a fervent thanksgiving that
Amanda was safely out of the way.

There was another person for whose absence just
then she felt devoutly thankful. When her engagement
was announced, early in July&mdash;against her own
wishes and in deference to Gerard's&mdash;she had received
a terrible letter from Halleck, denouncing
her perfidy, and threatening to come up at once.
She had answered it as best she could, imploring
his silence, and enclosing a sum of money which
she borrowed from her aunts, on the plea of urgent
248
bills&mdash;far from mythical, unfortunately, but which
remained unpaid. Whether or no Paul granted her
request, he pocketed the money, and she next heard
of him as having gone abroad for the summer. The
piece of news, casually mentioned one day in the
course of conversation, thrilled her with a sense of
overpowering relief, a suggestion, against which she
struggled in vain, of possible accidents, of all the
things that might reasonably happen to those who
travel by sea or land. Elizabeth breathed a devout
wish&mdash;it might almost be called a prayer&mdash;that this
particular traveler might never return.

Meanwhile, the summer passed; a cool, delightful
summer, rich with a succession of fragrant, sunshiny
days and long, balmy evenings; and signalized
by what for the Neighborhood was an unusual
amount of gaiety. Several entertainments were
given in honor of Elizabeth's engagement, among
others a large dinner at the Van Antwerps'. And
for this Elizabeth wore&mdash;it was Gerard's fancy&mdash;the
same white gown in which he had first seen her,
which he vowed that he cared for more than all her
other gowns put together. And though she had
pouted a little and declared that the others were far
more smart, she yielded to his wishes in this, as she
did in most things. Yet during the evening she
noticed now and again his eyes fixed upon her with
an odd, doubtful expression, as one who searches
his memory for the details of a likeness, and finds
inexplicably something lacking.

"I know what it is," he announced, abruptly,
when they had wandered after dinner for a little
249
while into the conservatory. "I was wondering
what it was I missed, and now I know. You haven't
got on your pearls. You wore them that night&mdash;in
fact, I never saw you in full dress without
them."

She flushed beneath his wondering gaze, reflecting
how constantly he had observed her, wishing&mdash;almost&mdash;that
he had not observed her quite so
much.

"Did you forget them?" he asked smiling, as
she made no response, but merely put up her hand
to her white neck, as if just reminded of the fact
that it was unadorned.

She plucked a rose from a plant near by, and began,
nonchalantly, to pull it to pieces.

"Oh, I&mdash;I didn't feel in the mood to put them
on," she said carelessly. "I&mdash;somehow I think I
shall not be in the mood to wear them again for a
long while."

He was watching her lazily, an amused smile
gleaming in the depths of his dark eyes. "What
an odd, capricious child you are!" he said. "You're
all made up of moods. I never know what to expect
next."

She was picking the rose to pieces very deliberately,
petal by petal, her eyes cast down. "Yes, I'm
all made up of moods," she echoed, softly. "You
must never be surprised at anything I do or say."

"I'm not," he returned, smiling. "And yet," he
went on, after a moment, "I confess I'm a little surprised&mdash;and
disappointed at this last one. I was
thinking, to tell the truth, as I had an idea you
250
valued those pearls particularly, of asking you to
let me have them, so that I could get you another
string to match them exactly."

The last petal of the rose fell from Elizabeth's
hand, she stared up at Gerard with an odd, frightened
expression. "Don't," she broke out, harshly.
"I&mdash;I hate pearls." Then with a sudden change, as
she saw the absolute bewilderment in his face, she
laid her hand gently on his arm. "Dear," she said,
very sweetly, "you must have patience with my
moods. I've got an idea, just now, that pearls are
unlucky. It's very silly, I know, but&mdash;don't argue
with me. Bear with me, Julian, let me have my own
way&mdash;a little."

They were alone in the conservatory. He put
his arm around her and pressed his lips to hers.
"A little," he murmured. "Have your own way&mdash;a
little! Didn't I tell you, my darling, that you
should have your own way in everything?"

She seemed to shrink away with an involuntary
shiver at the words. "Ah, but I don't want it," she
protested. "It's the last thing I want. If"&mdash;she
freed herself from his hold and stood looking him,
very sweetly and steadily, in the face&mdash;"if we are
married, Julian"&mdash;

"If!" he echoed, reproachfully.

"It's always safer to say 'if'" she said.

"Ah, but that's a suggestion I won't tolerate,"
he declared, firmly. "I'll have my own way in that,
if in nothing else. But, when we are married, Elizabeth"&mdash;he
paused.

"When we are married, then,"&mdash;she ceded the
251
point resignedly, blushing rosy red&mdash;"when we are
married, Julian, it must be your way, not mine.
Yours is far better, wiser&mdash;yes"&mdash;she stopped his
protest with an imperious gesture&mdash;"I feel it, even
though I try sometimes to dispute it. I shall never
do that&mdash;later. I shall try, with all the strength I
have, to be more worthy of your love. But now&mdash;just
now, Julian"&mdash;she looked at him anxiously, and
a note of appeal crept into her voice&mdash;"if I seem
odd, wilful, don't blame me, don't&mdash;doubt me"&mdash;

"Doubt you?" He took her hand and raised it
reverently to his lips. "I shall never doubt you&mdash;again,
my darling, no matter what you do or say."

There was the ring of absolute confidence in his
voice. Yet it might have been that which made her
shiver and shrink away, almost as if he had struck
her a blow.

"I&mdash;I think we had better go back to the others,"
she announced, abruptly, in a moment, and her intonation
was quick and sharp, almost as if she were
frightened and trying to escape from some threatened
danger. "It"&mdash;she smiled uncertainly&mdash;"it's
not quite good form, I think, for us to wander off
like this."

"Hang good form!" said Gerard, but still he
followed her back resignedly to the other room, and
she gave, as they reached the lights and the people,
a soft sigh of relief, which fortunately he did not
hear. Yet he noticed that for the rest of the evening
she was paler than she had been at first.

This pallor increased when Mrs. Bobby, too, voiced
the question which had been perplexing her all the
252
evening, as to why she did not wear the pearls.
Elizabeth did not mention her moods&mdash;it is evident
that women cannot be put off, in such important
questions as that of jewelry, with the vague answers
that might satisfy a man. She said that the
string had broken, and she had sent them to town
to be re-strung. Her aunts knew that they had been
there for that purpose since early spring, and they
could not understand why she did not send for them,
since other things had been left at the same jeweler's&mdash;notably
that little jeweled watch, which they had
heard of, but never seen. It was odd that Elizabeth
should have lost, to so large an extent, her taste
for pretty things.

Gerard, too, noticed this, but he would not ask
her any more questions. Later he gave her a string
of emeralds set with diamonds, which she wore to
entertainments in the Neighborhood that autumn,
and no one asked any more questions about the
pearls, since it was natural that she should prefer
to wear his gift.

His trust in her was absolute, as he had said. It
seemed as if he would make amends now by the
plenitude of his confidence, for that former instinctive,
reasonless distrust. And then she was so different
from the frivolous girl he had first imagined
her. Every day he reproached himself with his old
estimate of her character, as he discovered in her
new and unexpected depths of brain and soul. She
read all the books that he recommended&mdash;some of
them very deep, and she would once have thought
253
very tiresome&mdash;and she surprised him by the intelligence
of her criticisms, she took a sympathetic
interest in those articles by which he was making a
name for himself in the scientific world, and she
entered with an apparently perfect comprehension
into all his hopes, thoughts and aspirations. There
was only one thing in which she baffled him, one
point where her old wilfulness would come between
them. This was her obstinate and unaccountable refusal
to name their wedding day.

The Neighborhood was exercised on the subject.
It had been decided by unanimous consent that the
wedding should be in the autumn&mdash;"quite the best
time for a wedding" as the Rector's wife observed,
and lay awake one whole night planning the most
charming (and inexpensive) decorations of autumn
leaves and golden-rod. But all the reward she received
for her pains was the information that Elizabeth
did not care for autumn weddings, and as the
Misses Van Vorst at Gerard's request, had taken a
small apartment in town for the winter, the Rector's
wife had many pangs at the thought that the Bassett
Mills church and her husband would lose all the
prestige that would attend this great event&mdash;to say
nothing of the fee.

But when Gerard, as a matter of course, spoke of
their being married in town, Elizabeth looked up
deprecatingly into his face.

"Wait till I'm twenty-one," she pleaded. "This
is my unlucky year, you know. Do please, Julian,
wait till it's over."
254

But Gerard's face was set in rigid lines, like that
of a man who is determined to stand no more trifling.
Elizabeth's unlucky year would not be past till
April.


255

Chapter XXVII


It was a bleak December day and Central
Park seemed the last place where one would
wish to loiter. The sky hung lowering
overhead, gray, cold, heavy with the weight of invisible
snowflakes. The wind made a dull moaning
sound, as it stirred the bare branches of the trees.
The lake, where at another season you see children
sailing in the swan-boats, was nearly covered with
a thin coating of ice. But Elizabeth Van Vorst as
she stood with eyes intently fixed upon the small
space of water still visible, did not seem to notice
either the cold or the dreariness of the scene. She
was leaning against a tree, and looking at nothing
but the lake, till at the sound of foot-steps on the
path, she turned to face Paul Halleck.

"So you got my note," she said, speaking listlessly,
without a sign of surprise or satisfaction.
She did not give him her hand, which clasped the
other tightly, in the warm shelter of her muff.

"Yes, I got it; but I could wish you had chosen
a warmer meeting-place, my dear." The last months
had changed him, and not for the better. His figure
had grown stouter, his beauty coarser. She shrank
away in invincible repugnance from the careless
familiarity of his manner.
256

"It was the best place I could think of," she said,
curtly. "At home, we are always interrupted; at
your studio&mdash;it is impossible. I had to see you&mdash;somehow,
somewhere." She sat down on a bench
near by, and shivering drew her furs about her.

"You do me too much honor," Paul returned,
lightly. He took the seat beside her, his eyes resting,
in involuntary fascination, on the rounded outlines
of her cheek, the soft waves of auburn hair
beneath her small black hat. "It's a long time since
you have wished to see me of your own accord, my
dear," he said, in a tone in which resentment
struggled with his old, instinctive admiration of her
beauty.

She turned to him, suddenly, her eyes hard, her
face very white and set. "You know the reason."
"I had to see you, to&mdash;to talk things over. You
assume a right to control me, you ask me for money,
you try to frighten me with threats. There must
be an end of it. I"&mdash;she paused for a moment, and
drew her breath quickly, while she flushed a dull
crimson. "I have promised&mdash;Mr. Gerard," she said
"to&mdash;to marry him next month."

He interrupted her with a scornful laugh. "To
marry him&mdash;next month," he repeated. "And how
about that ceremony which we know of&mdash;you and
I&mdash;in the church at Cranston?"

The crimson flush faded and left her white, but
still she did not flinch. "I have thought of that,"
she said, steadily, "and I have decided that it should
not&mdash;make any difference. I don't believe the marriage
257
would be legal&mdash;but that's neither here nor
there. I don't want a divorce, I don't want the
thing known, I don't consider that we were ever
married. I don't think such a marriage as ours,
which we both entered into without the slightest
thought, which we have repented of"&mdash;

"Speak for yourself," he interposed.

"Which I have repented of, then," she went on,
"ought to be binding. The clergyman who married
us is dead; the witnesses, so old that they are childish,
probably remember nothing about it. There is
no one now living who remembers, except you and
I. And for me I have determined to think of it as
a dream, and I want you to promise me to do the
same."

"But&mdash;there is the notice in the parish register."
He was staring at her blankly, admiring in spite of
himself, the calm resolution of her manner, the business-like
precision with which she was unfolding her
arguments, as if she had rehearsed them many
times to herself.

"I have thought of that, too," she said, in answer
to his last objection, "and I don't think it in the
least likely that any one will ever see it. Why
should they, without any clue? At all events, this
is&mdash;the only way out." She faltered as her mind
wandered for a moment unwillingly to another way
which she had now despaired of&mdash;too easy a solution
to her difficulties ever to come true. What a
fool she had been to think that he would die! People
like that never die. As she saw him now, in the
258
full pride of his health and good looks, it seemed impossible
to believe that any misfortune could assail
him&mdash;least of all death! ...

"There is&mdash;no other way," she repeated, with a
little, involuntary sob. "The risks are not great&mdash;but,
at any rate, I must take them. Now, there is
only one other thing"&mdash;She paused for a moment
and then drew out of her purse a plain gold ring,
and showed it to him. It was the ring which she
had once worn on her finger for a few minutes,
which she had kept carefully hidden ever since. She
glanced about her; there was no one in sight except
the policeman, who in the distance near the carriage-drive,
was pacing up and down at his cold
post and beating his hands to keep them warm.
Elizabeth rose and went to the edge of the lake.
With well-directed aim, she threw the tiny circlet
of gold so that it struck the fast-vanishing surface
of water and quickly disappeared. She drew a long
sigh of relief. "There," she said, "that is over."

Paul watched her curiously. He saw that she
attached to this little action a mysterious significance.
He sneered harshly. "Very pretty and theatrical,"
he said. "But do you really think that by a thing
like that&mdash;throwing away a ring&mdash;you can dissolve
a marriage?"

She turned to him, her white face still resolute
and intensely solemn. "I don't know," she said,
quietly, "but I wanted to throw it away before you,
so that you would understand that everything is
over between us, and that day at Cranston is as if
it never had been. Never had been, you understand,"
259
she repeated, with eager emphasis. "I
want you to promise to think of it like that."

He shrugged his shoulders. "How we either of
us think of it, I suppose, doesn't make much difference
so far as the legality of the thing goes,"
he said. "But,&mdash;have your own way. If you
choose to commit a crime, it's not my affair."

"A crime!" She started and stared at him. "Do
you call that a crime?"

He smiled. "It's a rough word to use for the
actions of a charming young girl," he said "but I'm
afraid that the law might look at it in that light."

Elizabeth returned to the bench and sat down.
She seemed to be pondering this new view of the
matter. "I can't help it," she said at last, in a
low voice. "If that's a crime, why&mdash;I understand
how people are led into them. And I can't ruin his
happiness, crime or no crime."

"And my happiness?" he asked her bitterly.
"You never think of that? You professed to love
me once. You took me for better, for worse, and
how have you kept your word? If my life is ruined,
the responsibility is yours. If you had gone with me
as I wanted you to, I should have been a different
man." There was a curious accent of sincerity in
his voice. He really believed for the moment what
he said.

The reproach was not without effect. She looked
at him more gently, with troubled eyes that seemed
to express not only contrition, but a certain involuntary
sympathy. "It's true," she said. "I have
treated you badly, and broken the most solemn promise
260
any one could make. I don't defend myself;
but&mdash;I'm willing to make what amends I can. I
can't give you myself, but at least I can give you
what little money you would have had with me.
When I am married to"&mdash;she paused and flushed,
but concluded her sentence firmly&mdash;"to Mr. Gerard,
I will give you&mdash;all the money I have."

Paul paced up and down, apparently in deep
thought. It was evident that her offer tempted him,
yet some impulse urged him to refuse it. He stopped
suddenly in front of her. "Principal or interest,
do you mean?" he asked, in a tone in which the
thirst for gain distinctly predominated.

The doubtful sympathy in Elizabeth's eyes faded,
and was replaced by a look of unmistakable disgust.
"I suppose I could hardly give you the principal,"
she said, coldly. "But I will pay over the income
every year." She named the sum. "Isn't it
enough?"

"That depends," he said, looking at her coolly.
"It is enough, of course, for Elizabeth Van Vorst,
but for Mrs. Julian Gerard"&mdash;

He stopped as an electric shock of anger seemed
to thrill Elizabeth from head to foot. "You don't
suppose," she cried, "that I would give you his
money?"

"Then," said Paul, curtly, "he doesn't know?"

"Certainly not," she said, haughtily.

He began again reflectively to pace up and down.
"I don't see," he said, "how you are to pay me
over this money without his knowing it."
261

"Don't trouble yourself about that," said Elizabeth,
contemptuously. "Mr. Gerard will never ask
what I do with my money."

"Well he has enough of his own, certainly," said
Paul, philosophically. "And yet, poor fellow, I am
sorry for him if he ever finds out how you have deceived
him."

"He never shall find out," said Elizabeth. She
rose and pulled down her veil. "It is so cold," she
said shivering, and indeed she looked chilled to the
core. "I cannot stay here any longer. This thing
is settled, isn't it? You will promise?" There was
a tone of piteous entreaty in her voice.

"How am I to know," he asked, still hesitating
"that you will keep your word? Once married to
Gerard, you might&mdash;forget."

"If I do," she returned quietly, "you will always
have the power to break yours and ruin my happiness."

"So be it, then. I won't interfere with you.
After all, we probably shouldn't have got on well.
Come&mdash;let us part friends, at least."

He held out his hand, but hers was again securely
hidden in her muff, and the smile that gleamed on
her face was pale and cold as the winter day itself.
"Good-bye," she said, and turned away. He fell
back, with a muttered oath.

"Upon my word, my lady," he said, "you might
be a little more gracious." At that moment Elizabeth
came back. There was a softer look on her
face.
262

"I loved you once," she said. "Good-bye." And
she held out her hand. He took it in silence. Thus
they parted for the last time.

It had been a successful interview. She had
gained all that she dared hope for. Seated in the
warm car going home, and shivering as from an
ague, she told herself that she had silenced forever
all opposition to her wishes. Yet it did not seem
a victory. Words which Paul had said lingered in
her mind, stinging her with their contempt, the fact
that even he could set himself above her. "A
crime!" She had never considered it in that light.
Surely it was impossible on the face of it that she,
Elizabeth Van Vorst, could commit a crime....
And then again&mdash;what was it he had said? "Poor
fellow, I am sorry for him, if ever he finds out
how you have deceived him."

"But he never shall," she said to herself, resolutely
as before. "Crime or no crime, his love is
worth it. He never shall find out."


263

Chapter XXVIII


Elizabeth had little time in those days for
thought. There was still less time, even,
when she was alone with Gerard. The days
passed in a whirl of gaiety, in which she had been
swallowed up since her return to town. It was a
state of things which bored Gerard extremely, but
secure in the promise he had at last obtained from
her that the wedding should be at the end of January
he possessed his soul in such patience as he
could muster. And when he requested as a special
favor, that she would refuse all invitations for the
thirty-first of December and see the Old Year out
in peace, she consented at once, and the hope of a
quiet evening buoyed him up through other weary
ones, when he would lean in his old fashion against
the wall, and watch her across a ball-room, the
center of an admiring court. Yet, even as he did
so, the proud consciousness of proprietorship swelled
his heart. She was his&mdash;his! He had no longer
any doubt of her, or jealousy of the men who talked
to her.

Why then was the expected evening, when it
came, fraught with an intangible sense of gloom,
of oppression, which made the time pass heavily?
264
The old Dutch clock, which the Misses Van Vorst
had brought with them from the country seemed
to-night to mark the hours with extraordinary slowness,
as if the Old Year were in no hurry to be
gone, even though the noises in the street, the blowing
of horns and of whistles were enough, one might
have thought, to hasten his departure.

Elizabeth was pacing restlessly up and down the
room. Her hands were clasped carelessly before
her, her long house-dress of white cashmere, belted
in by a gold girdle, fell about her in graceful folds.
There was a flush in her cheeks, a somewhat feverish
light in her eyes; she started nervously now
and then as some enterprising small boy blew an
especially shrill blast on his horn.

"I don't know why it is," she said at last with
a petulant little laugh, coming back to her seat by
the fire opposite Gerard, and taking up a piece of
work, in which she absently set a few stitches,
"New Year's Eve always gets on my nerves, I
think of all my sins&mdash;and that's very unpleasant!"
She broke off, pouting childishly, as if in disgust
at the intrusion of unwelcome ideas.

He was watching her lazily, with the amused, indulgent
smile which certain of her moods had always
the power to call forth; the smile of a strong
man, who felt himself quite able to cope with them.
"With such terrible sins as yours, Elizabeth," he
said, "it must be indeed a dreadful thing to think
of them."

She turned quickly towards him. "You don't
think that they can be very bad?"
265

"I should be willing to take the risk of offering
you absolution."

She bent down over her work so that her face was
hidden. "Ah, you&mdash;you don't know"&mdash;&mdash;she
rather breathed than spoke. He only smiled incredulously,
as one who knew her better than she did
herself.

"Play for me, darling," he said, after awhile, and
she went mechanically to the piano. But her playing
was always a matter of mood, and to-night her
fingers faltered, the keys did not respond as usual.
She passed restlessly from one thing to another&mdash;snatches
of Brahms, Chopin, Tschaikowski, with the
same jarring note running through them all.

She broke off at last, with a wild clash of chords.
"I can't play to-night," she said, and came back to
the fire. "How calm you are!" she said, standing
beside Gerard and looking down at him with
eyes almost of reproach. "This horrible evening
doesn't get on your nerves at all."

"How can it?"&mdash;Gerard possessed himself of her
hand and raised it to his lips.&mdash;"How can I waste
any regrets on the Old Year," he said, "when the
New Year is to bring me&mdash;so much happiness?"

She started and caught her breath, as if the words
held a sting. "Ah, yes," she repeated, very low
"it is to bring you&mdash;so much happiness!" For a
moment she left her hand in his and then withdrew
it with a stifled sigh. She went back very still and
pale, to her seat on the other side of the fire, and
taking up her work, she fixed her eyes upon it intently.
266

"And so you think it is to bring you happiness?"
she said, in a low voice, continuing the subject as it
seemed in spite of herself. "You are quite sure
of that, Julian, you have&mdash;no doubts?" She raised
her eyes with a wistful questioning that puzzled
him.

"Doubts, Elizabeth!" He stared back at her reproachfully,
his brows drawn together frowning.
"Why do you harp so much on that, my darling?
Why should I have doubts?"

"Why, some men might, you know."&mdash;Her eyes
were bent again upon her work.&mdash;"You yourself&mdash;you
had them, you know, when you first knew me."

He flushed. "Don't remind me of that," he said,
hastily.

"Well, it may have been a true presentiment."&mdash;She
gave him an odd, furtive look. "I've wondered&mdash;sometimes&mdash;if
I were as nice naturally as other
girls I know. I hadn't, to begin with, the sort of
mother that&mdash;most girls have"&mdash;&mdash;She hesitated, a
painful crimson flooded her face, her eyes filled with
tears. Gerard stared at her in amazement. He
had never heard her allude to her mother before,
and had supposed her entirely ignorant of all painful
facts in the family history.

"Darling," he broke out, indignantly, "who has
told you&mdash;things like that?"

"Who? Oh! I don't know."&mdash;She put the question
aside listlessly.&mdash;"One always hears unpleasant
facts, somehow. I always knew that she wasn't
the&mdash;the sort of person that the Neighborhood would
call on"&mdash;a painful smile hovered about her lips.
267
"It used to make me very unhappy&mdash;but lately&mdash;it
hasn't seemed to matter. And yet&mdash;I think of it
sometimes"&mdash;&mdash;She broke off suddenly and looked
at Gerard with a strange light in her eyes. "Doesn't
it make a difference to you? Doesn't it occur to
you sometimes that I may be&mdash;my mother's daughter;
that it would be wiser to&mdash;distrust me?" Her
voice died away at the last words into a hoarse
whisper.

"Elizabeth!"&mdash;Gerard sprang to his feet. He
went over to her and took both her hands in his
strong grasp. "Elizabeth, never let me hear these
morbid fancies again. Never suppose that anything
your mother did or left undone, can make a difference
in my faith in you!"

He stood looking down at her with eyes full of
an imperious tenderness. She trembled and shrank
away before them, as if frightened. "You trust
me, then?" she repeated, and she drew a long sobbing
breath. "You're quite sure you trust me?"

"Absolutely."&mdash;Gerard's smile lit up his face.&mdash;"How
often, you exacting woman," he asked, "do
you want me to promise that I will never doubt you
again."

There was silence for a moment. The noises in the
street sounding suddenly with redoubled violence in
the stillness, seemed to punctuate Gerard's words
with an outburst of derision. To Elizabeth's fancy
the whole atmosphere of the room was tense, vibrant,
filled with jarring echoes of the noise without.
Even the old Dutch clock, whose ticking was
one of her earliest memories, seemed to beat with
268
a new, discordant note of mockery, as if it too were
uttering its ironical comment on the wisdom of
a man's faith.

Elizabeth shuddered and thrust Gerard's hands
away. "I wish&mdash;I wish I deserved your trust,
Julian," she broke out, wildly. Then she laid her
face on the arm of the chair and sobbed. He fell
back and stared at her aghast. The tender smile
was arrested, frozen on his lips. For him, too, as
for her, the room was suddenly filled with discordant
vibrations, a sense of unreasoning dread.

In a moment Elizabeth looked up; with a great
effort she conquered her tears. She went to Gerard
and put her hand on his arm. The face she raised
to his was white, trembling in a pathetic appeal.
The tears still glistened on her long lashes, there
was a tremulous sweetness in her great dark eyes,
in the quivering lines about her pale lips. "Julian,"
she said, "if I'm not&mdash;not worthy of your trust&mdash;not
worthy of your love, even"&mdash;she faltered&mdash;"if
I had deceived you&mdash;were deceiving you still"&mdash;&mdash;she
paused and looked him in the face with an
agonized questioning.

"Yes?"&mdash;Gerard's hoarse voice urged her on.&mdash;"If
you were deceiving me? It isn't&mdash;it can't be
true, but if you were?"&mdash;&mdash;

"If I were," she went on, steadily, "if I had kept
one thing from you&mdash;against my will&mdash;oh, God
knows! sorely against my will"&mdash;her voice broke&mdash;"if
it had been a weight on my mind day and
night&mdash;if I had longed to tell you and had tried to
do it and always&mdash;my courage failed me, and&mdash;and&mdash;if
269
at last&mdash;at last, I told you&mdash;would you&mdash;think
me so very much to blame, couldn't you&mdash;forgive?"&mdash;Her
voice again faltered piteously, the last word
was barely audible.

He broke away from her and took two or three
turns up and down the room, breathing heavily, like
a man who had been running. "Tell me what this
secret is?" he broke out, fiercely, pausing suddenly
in front of her. "How can I tell if&mdash;&mdash;I could forgive,
till I know what it is?"

Again the silence. Elizabeth's white lips tried,
apparently in vain, to form an answer. The courage
which a moment before had possessed her,
seemed to shrivel up and die away, before that fierce
light in his eyes.

"Tell me," he repeated, inexorably, "what it is."

She put out her hand suddenly with a pleading
gesture. "Ah, let us first see the Old Year out together,"
she murmured, "as we planned. I should
like to feel that you loved me till&mdash;the very end of
it. You may not&mdash;afterwards. It won't be long.
See&mdash;it's nearly time." She glanced up at the clock.
It was ticking faster now, as it seemed, and steadily,
the hour hand well towards midnight.

Elizabeth went to the window and flung it open.
The current of cold air which flooded the room
seemed to give her relief; she leaned out as far as
she could, inhaling it in long, fevered gasps. Gerard
followed and stood behind her, in an agony of
impatience, distraught by a hundred incongruous,
terrible suggestions. The prolonged suspense
seemed, in his over-wrought state, a very refinement
270
of cruelty, yet some instinct kept him silent,
left to her the mastery of the situation.

In the street there was unwonted stir and bustle.
A crowd assembled to greet the New Year. Small
boys, whose horns made the night hideous, pranced
about like uncouth imps of darkness; the street-lamps,
as they flickered, cast a weird, uncertain light
on the snow-covered ground. But the moon, riding
overhead, shone peacefully, and myriads of stars
studded the wintry sky. Down towards the Battery
one could hear, above all coarser sounds, the
chimes of Old Trinity ringing faint but true.

Elizabeth's eyes were riveted upon St. George's
clock, which stood out, not many blocks away, above
the roofs of intervening houses. Her lips moved,
but no sound came; one hand grasped convulsively
the curtain behind her. To Gerard as he watched
her those fifteen minutes before the New Year were
the longest of his life.

Suddenly all noises slackened; upon the listening
crowd outside there fell a pause, a hush of expectation.
St. George's clock boomed out the hour
in twelve majestic strokes. The old Dutch clock
within the room echoed it in quieter tones. And
then, as the last stroke died away, the crowd stirred,
there arose a hideous Babel of sound&mdash;cat-calling,
shouting, blowing of horns and whistles; pandemonium
set loose. It raged for several minutes,
and stopped abruptly, exhausted by its own violence.
There was again silence, and then a burst
of laughter. Some one in the crowd cried loudly
and heartily: "Happy New Year!"
271

Elizabeth shivered, as if with a sudden consciousness
of the cold. She shut the window and faced
Gerard. Against the vivid background of the crimson
curtain, in her clinging white dress, her pale
beauty, crowned by her red-gold hair, stood out with
a strange, unearthly quality, like that of some pictured
saint. There was a look on her face which
was tragic in its despairing resolution, yet which
had in it a certain exaltation, as if she had risen for
the moment at least, above herself, to heights hitherto
unknown.

"You shall know the worst of me, at last. You
won't"&mdash;she gave an odd little laugh&mdash;"you won't
grant me absolution, Julian, I'm afraid. But oh,
I'm sick&mdash;God knows, I'm sick of lies!" She
paused and caught her breath as if for one supreme
effort. "This is the truth," she said. "I was married
to Paul Halleck&mdash;before I knew you, more than
a year ago."

He staggered back, as if she had struck him a
blow. "You were&mdash;married&mdash;to Paul Halleck?"

"Yes," she repeated, in a dull monotone, "married
to him&mdash;more than a year ago."

He was still staring at her as if stupefied. "Married!"
he repeated, "married all this time!&mdash;when
you professed to love me! When"&mdash;a pause&mdash;"you
promised to marry me! Oh, it's impossible,"
he cried, with a sudden flash of incredulity, and he
put out his hand and touched her involuntarily.
"Say you're only playing with me," he begged her,
"trying my faith&mdash;say it's not true." His voice
shook, unconsciously his hand closed upon her wrist
272
with a grasp that might have hurt her, had she been
capable just then of feeling physical pain.

"It&mdash;it is true," she said, and stood motionless,
white and rigid as a statue, her head bent.

He still stared incredulous for a moment, and then
the reality of what she said seemed to sink into his
soul. With a quick, involuntary gesture, which
wounded more than words, he let her hand fall, and
began to pace up and down the room.

"Good God!" she heard him mutter. "Married
all these months!&mdash;and I, who loved you, trusted
you!"&mdash;&mdash;He broke off with a gesture of angry
despair. Her lip quivered, her eyes followed him
for a moment and then filled with tears. She went
over to the mantel-piece, and resting her arms upon
it, she hid her face.

It was a long time before he stopped beside her,
but then his voice showed recovered self-control.
"Will you tell me," he said, "exactly how and
when this marriage took place?"

She turned with a little shuddering sigh and
raised her white, exhausted face to his. "It was
at Cranston," she said, quietly, "one day in July.
I did it hastily. My aunts were opposed to it, and&mdash;I
hated to make them unhappy. But I&mdash;I
thought I loved him. It was a mistake. I went
up to Cranston to meet him, and&mdash;we were married.
It was in church&mdash;there were witnesses, we signed a
register&mdash;it was all legal, or at least I suppose so.
And then&mdash;when we came out"&mdash;&mdash;she paused.

"Yes&mdash;when you came out?"&mdash;Gerard repeated
the words hoarsely, his brows drawn together, his
273
eyes fixed upon her in an agonized questioning.&mdash;"What
then, Elizabeth?"

She hesitated, staring straight before her, as if
she were trying to recall the whole thing exactly as
it happened. "When we came out of the church, I
felt&mdash;I don't know why&mdash;I felt frightened. I
seemed to realize&mdash;indeed, I think I had realized all
the time&mdash;what a mistake it was. He begged me to
come away with him, and I&mdash;I refused. He had
promised me that I should go home, and that he
wouldn't claim me for six months, and&mdash;I held him
to it. He gave in at last, and so&mdash;we parted"&mdash;&mdash;

"Ah!"&mdash;Gerard drew a long breath.&mdash;"You&mdash;parted?"

"Yes. I left him and came home. I got there
about four&mdash;my aunts suspected nothing. He went
abroad. And&mdash;after a while he stopped writing, I
thought he had forgotten me. It all began to seem
like a dream. And then&mdash;Eleanor Van Antwerp
asked me to come to town, and&mdash;the rest you know."

"No, not all." Gerard insisted. "When the
fellow came home, why didn't he claim you? How
have you kept him quiet, all this time?"

"Ah, that was easy."&mdash;She spoke listlessly.&mdash;"He
didn't care anything about me; I used to give him
money. I sold my pearls&mdash;all my jewelry, in fact.
Yes"&mdash;as Gerard uttered a horrified exclamation&mdash;"it
was a terrible bondage, but what could I do?
He had me in his power. I used to wonder if the
marriage were legal, but there was no one whom I
dared ask. And then I thought sometimes that he
might die&mdash;I had all sorts of wild ideas; but nothing
274
happened, and meanwhile he threatened&mdash;to tell
you everything. I bought him off twice, and then&mdash;this
last time"&mdash;she paused&mdash;"this last time I
promised him all my income if he would give me
up forever, and never trouble me again. Ah, you
think it unpardonable, I see"&mdash;she put out her hand
with a deprecating gesture&mdash;"but you don't know
what it is to be tempted&mdash;desperate. I was determined
I wouldn't ruin my life. And then&mdash;then"&mdash;her
voice faltered&mdash;"this evening when you
seemed so happy, so trustful&mdash;that was what hurt
me, Julian&mdash;it was easier when you were jealous,
suspicious, as you were at first&mdash;it came to me suddenly
that I couldn't begin the New Year&mdash;I
couldn't begin our life together with this&mdash;this terrible
secret weighing on my soul. And so I&mdash;I
told you"&mdash;&mdash;

Elizabeth's voice faltered, she raised her eyes in
a half conscious appeal. It seemed to her for the
moment as if the agony of that confession must
make amends to some extent even for such deceit as
hers. But Gerard's face did not soften. Her
whole conduct seemed to him monstrous, incredible.
He could not accept as atonement this tardy repentance,
the fact that she had told him the truth&mdash;at
the eleventh hour.

The thought occurred to him, which she had herself
suggested, earlier in the evening. He remembered
chance gossip of the Neighborhood about her
antecedents, listened to vaguely even before he knew
her, and haunting him afterwards in the first days
of their acquaintance, till love had made him cast
275
it aside, as a thing of no importance. Now it recurred
to his mind as the only explanation&mdash;he did
not accept it as an excuse&mdash;of this weakness which
seemed otherwise inexplicable. No doubt there
must be, he told himself, in the child of such parents,&mdash;it
would be strange if there were not&mdash;some hereditary
taint, some lack of moral fibre, which curiously
imperceptible in other ways, must needs assert
itself in any great moral crisis. The thought, which
might have softened him, seemed at the time only
to steel him the more against her.

He fell again to pacing up and down, thinking it
over; seeing past incidents afresh in the merciless
light of his present knowledge; recalling this or that
insignificant circumstance which at the time had
aroused, unreasonably as it seemed, his distrust;&mdash;her
occasional uneasiness and distress, that air she
had of being on her guard, the look in the picture&mdash;ah,
he understood it now! It was the shadow of
falsehood, which for months had clouded her every
thought and action. What a fool he had been, he
reflected fiercely&mdash;how he had allowed himself to
be deceived&mdash;made an easy prey by the extent of
his infatuation&mdash;how she had juggled with the
truth, telling him the worst of herself in such a way
that he had believed, all the more determinedly, the
reverse.

He stopped at last his restless pacing to and fro
and paused beside her. The fierce tide of anger,
the first bitterness of his disillusion, had subsided.
He was cold, with the coldness of despair. His
face was worn and haggard, as if from the suffering
276
of years, but it was set in rigid lines, from which
all feeling seemed to have vanished. His eyes were
dry and hard.

"I think," he said, and there was a dull, toneless
sound in his voice; he spoke slowly, like one who
either weighed his words with great care, or was
afraid to trust himself too far, "I think there had
better be an end to this. I should only say, if I said
all I thought, things I might afterwards&mdash;regret;
and I wouldn't"&mdash;his voice broke ever so little&mdash;"God
knows I don't want to be unjust! But I cannot"&mdash;he
let his hand fall with a look of dull
despair&mdash;"I cannot understand how you have kept
this from me all these months!"

He paused, as if expecting an answer, an excuse,
perhaps of some sort; but she said nothing, and he
went on, after a moment, his voice growing more
uncertain: "It isn't so much the marriage&mdash;that
could be, perhaps"&mdash;He hesitated, his heavy
brows drawn together frowning&mdash;"The man must
be an absolute wretch," he said, suddenly, "there
must be&mdash;for your sake I hope so&mdash;some way
out"&mdash;&mdash;

"Oh, for me"&mdash;she made a little gesture of utter
carelessness&mdash;"for me it can make no difference&mdash;now."

"For myself," he went on, not heeding her words,
perhaps not fully grasping their meaning, "I
couldn't&mdash;whether the marriage held or not&mdash;I
couldn't forgive&mdash;being so deceived."

He stopped and again seemed to expect some protest,
but she only repeated, in a dull voice of complete
277
acquiescence: "No, I didn't think you could
forgive&mdash;being so deceived"&mdash;&mdash;

"Even if I could forgive," he said, "I could
never trust"&mdash;&mdash;

"No," she repeated, "you could never trust."
Her face was colorless, but impassive, as if it had
been turned to stone, her voice was almost as firm
as his. "You are quite right," she said. "I deserve
all the harsh things you could say. It is kind
of you to say&mdash;so few. Perhaps, later, you'll judge
me more gently; but&mdash;I couldn't expect it now.
And so"&mdash;she faltered and caught her breath, as if
her strength failed her&mdash;"and so good-bye," she said
at last. "I think it can only hurt us both to&mdash;discuss
this any longer."

Her calmness stunned him. He had been prepared
for tears&mdash;excuses&mdash;but she offered no defence
and made no effort to arouse his pity. There
was a dignity in her complete submission. He
looked at her, his face working with varied emotions;
and then he said "Good-bye" mechanically
and took her hand for an instant. It was icy cold
and lay impassively in his. He dropped it and
moved towards the door, as if under some spell, deprived
of all capacity for thought or feeling. Involuntarily,
her eyes followed him. Was this the
parting, after so many months? But at the door he
paused, he looked back. The firelight played on
her hair, on her white dress, the drooping lines of
her slender form, the deathly pallor of her face, the
despair in her eyes.... He softened, perhaps, or it
might be that the mere physical spell of her beauty
278
held him, even when all that made the glory of his
love, had been rudely shattered. He came back,
caught her in his arms, and pressed burning kisses
on her lips. She trembled as if they had been
blows, but she made no effort to free herself. And
then, as if ashamed of his weakness, he let her go
and went out hastily. A moment later she heard
the front door close, with a dull sound that echoed
through the quiet rooms.

She stood where he had left her, staring blankly
about her at the familiar objects which seemed to
have acquired, during the last hour, an air of
change, of unreality. What had happened, what
had she done? Awhile ago she had been borne up
by a courage that seemed almost heroic, a sense of
moral victory. Now that had failed her. She was
simply a woman despised and heart-broken, who by
her own suicidal act had destroyed her happiness.

"How&mdash;how can I bear it?" she broke out, at
last, fiercely, and sinking down on the hearth-rug,
she lay prostrate, her face hidden, while her whole
frame shook with convulsive sobs. The old Dutch
clock ticked softly, pitifully, in the silence; the fire
flickered and died away. But outside in the street
spasmodic whistles kept on blowing, and belated
wayfarers still bade each other, with laughter and
jollity, "Happy New Year."


279

Chapter XXIX


It was eight days later. Elizabeth's trouble
and the New Year were both a week old.
She had lived through the time somehow or
another, had even faced those smaller trials which follow
in the wake of any great catastrophe. She had
told the whole truth to her aunts&mdash;it was only less
hard than telling Gerard&mdash;she had written to her
friends to announce the breaking of her engagement,
and had countermanded the orders for her
trousseau. These affairs disposed of, she was ready
to face the world with such strength as she had
left.

For Gerard the situation was simpler. He had
taken at once his man's way out of it, and pacing
the deck of an ocean steamer, he tried to distract
his mind and forget his trouble in plans for extensive
travel and scientific research. They had been
his resource once before, when a woman had disappointed
him.

He had not seen Elizabeth again. He dreaded,
perhaps, to trust himself, or perhaps his anger was
still too great. But he had written before he left
to her aunts, urging them to consult a lawyer and
take steps at once to free her from the results of her
280
rash marriage. To himself, he justified this weakness&mdash;if
it were weakness&mdash;by the thought of Halleck's
baseness. "I could not bear to think of her
as his wife," he said to himself, "a fellow who could
give her up for money!"

Upon Elizabeth's aunts the affair had come like
a thunderbolt. They were quite unprepared for it,
though many suspicious circumstances&mdash;the mystery
as to Elizabeth's jewels, her own occasional
words&mdash;might have suggested the idea that something
was amiss. But absorbed in their delight in the
engagement, their affection for Gerard, they had not
the heart to formulate any doubt they might have
felt. Now, in the first shock of their awakening,
they remembered unwillingly the same facts of family
history which had occurred to Gerard. What
could they have expected from Malvina's child but
deceit, folly and disgrace? But they were gentle
souls, and had no reproaches for Elizabeth, only a
silent, sorrowful pity, which hurt the girl's proud
spirit more than the sharpest words.

She was lingering that morning, pale and languid,
over her untasted breakfast, and Miss Cornelia,
from behind the coffee-urn, stole anxious
glances towards her, all sense of injury lost in her
distress over the girl's wretched looks, and fear that
she was going to be ill. They two were alone, Miss
Joanna having already started to do her marketing,
when the maid entered with the belated newspaper.
Miss Cornelia held out her delicate, tremulous hand
for it, nervously apprehensive of that paragraph
281
which no doubt in the society columns, announced
that the engagement between Miss Van Vorst and
Mr. Gerard had been broken "by mutual consent."

It was not this notice which met her eyes, but
some exciting head-lines on the first page which had
already attracted the attention of the cook and the
housemaid.

"Elizabeth," said Miss Cornelia, in a stifled
voice. "Elizabeth&mdash;what is this?"

Elizabeth raised her vacant eyes, and saw Miss
Cornelia deathly white and staring in horror at the
paper. "Is it?" she said. "It must be. What a
dispensation! So young, too."

"Auntie," said Elizabeth, impatiently, "why
don't you say what it is?"

"I am afraid he was very ill prepared," said Miss
Cornelia, apparently talking to herself and oblivious
of her niece's presence. But suddenly she seemed
to realize it and placed her hand over the paper.
"My dear, don't look at this yet," she faltered.
"You&mdash;it will be a shock, Elizabeth. Prepare
yourself."

Elizabeth did not wait to hear more, but went to
her and seized the paper from her hand. The headline
told, in large type, how Paul Halleck, the prominent
young singer, had died the evening before of
a mysterious draught of poison, which had been sent
to him by mail.

There followed in smaller type the details of the
affair, but Elizabeth did not read them. She sank
into the nearest chair and sat staring before her
282
with dilated eyes, that seemed to express less surprise
or terror than a sort of awe, as at some unexpected
manifestation of Providence.

"It was I who killed him," she said. She spoke
in a dull, dream-like way, not in the least conscious,
as it seemed, of anything extraordinary in the
words. Poor Miss Cornelia could form no other
conclusion than that she had suddenly lost her mind.

"Elizabeth, my darling," she remonstrated,
"what do you mean?" But Elizabeth was still
staring before her vacantly, absorbed in her own
thoughts.

"And so it has happened!" she said, in a low
voice, "at last!&mdash;when I had given up hope!"&mdash;She
was quite oblivious of her aunt's horror or of
the staring eyes of the maid, who stood listening,
the coffee-pot in her hand, her mouth wide open.
But at that moment Miss Cornelia suddenly remembered
her presence and signed to her to leave the
room&mdash;an order obeyed reluctantly.

"Now, Elizabeth," Miss Cornelia faltered out, as
the door closed, "do, my darling, explain what you
mean. It's quite absurd, you know, to say that you
had anything to do with this."

"I wished it," said Elizabeth, gazing at her with
dull, expressionless eyes. "I wished, I even prayed,
that he might die. And my wishes always come
true&mdash;only it is in such a way that it does no good."

"But you can't," urged Miss Cornelia, in desperation,
"you can't kill people by wishing, Elizabeth.
Of course, there are things that one can't&mdash;feel as
sorry for as one would like"&mdash;Her voice faltered, as
283
she thought of certain individuals connected with
her own life, whose death it had been hard to regard
in the light of an affliction. "We can't help our
thoughts," she murmured, "we can only pray not
to give way to them."

"Ah, but I didn't," said Elizabeth. "I encouraged
them. And now I shall have remorse, I suppose,
all my life." She sat pondering a moment,
while the expression on her face grew softer. "I
am sorry he is dead," she said, at last. "It does me
no good now&mdash;and he seemed so full of life the last
time I saw him. But it was his fate, no doubt&mdash;a
fortune-teller told him he would die before the year
was out. It was his unlucky year, as well as mine.
And the prediction has come true&mdash;in both cases."

"But how did it happen?" urged Miss Cornelia.
"Do read, Elizabeth, how it was. Did he drink
poison by mistake?"

Elizabeth took up the paper and read the story,
which grew to be a famous one in the annals of New
York crime. Halleck had received on New Year's
Eve a package which contained a small hunting-flask
of sherry. There was no name or card with
the present&mdash;if present it were; nothing to identify
the giver, except the hand-writing on the package,
which he did not recognize.

He suspected nothing, however, imagining the
card to have been forgotten, and accepted the flask
as a belated Christmas present; but kept it unopened,
in the hope of discovering from whom it
came. He had brought it out and showed it the
night before to some friends, and the flask and the
284
box in which it arrived were passed from one to the
other, but each disclaimed all knowledge of them.

"To me," said D'Hauteville, who happened to be
present, "it looks like a woman's handwriting, disguised
to seem like a man's. Perhaps"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"it
contains a love potion."

"Or a death potion," suggested another man,
laughing.

"I'm not afraid," said the young singer, lightly,
"of either catastrophe." With a smile he poured
some of the wine into a glass and raised it to his
lips. "To the health," he said, "of the mysterious
giver." He emptied the glass and put it down, observing
that it must be, after all, a woman's gift,
since no man would have chosen such poor wine.
"Try it," he said, but by some fortunate chance no
one did. And in a few minutes Halleck was taken
desperately ill, and died before the hastily-summoned
physician could save him.

This is, briefly put, the account which Elizabeth
read, at first with a strange sense of unreality, as if
such tragedies, of which she had often read before
in the papers, could not possibly occur within the
circle of her own acquaintance. Then followed a
growing horror, a feeling of passionate remorse for
her own indifference.

"Read it, auntie," she said, thrusting the paper
into Miss Cornelia's hand. "I&mdash;I must be alone to
think it over." She went quickly and shut herself
in her room. But when there she did not lie down
and cry, as might have been best for her; she had
not shed any tears since New Year's Eve. She
285
paced up and down, going over the whole thing in
her mind, imagining the details with a feverish vividness,
struggling, above all, with this irrational, yet
terrible sense of guilt.

It was irrational&mdash;this she realized even in her
state of feverish excitement. The vindictive wish
which had crossed her brain would never have gone
beyond it and resolved itself into action. She
would not even&mdash;she knew this now&mdash;have been a
passive factor in Paul's death; she would have
been the first to go to his aid, had she seen him
suffering. No selfish remembrance of her own gain
would have stopped her. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;with
all her reasoning, her mind always returned to the
same point. She had wished for his death, and her
wishes had been fulfilled, too late for her own advantage,
only as it seemed, to add to her punishment.

The idea occurred to her all at once that she must
go and look at his dead body. It presented itself, in
some irrational way, in the light of an atonement.
The fever in her blood, the beginning of an illness,
made the strained, hysterical thought seem natural
and almost inevitable. She was not conscious of
doing anything unusual. Hastily, she dressed herself,
choosing instinctively a black gown and tying
a black veil over her face, and went out into the
street, where the cold air, which she had not faced
for a week, blew refreshingly on her burning
cheeks. She walked all the way, rapidly, choosing
unfrequented avenues, and looking neither to the
right nor the left, her mind intent on the one object,
286
yet with a strange relief in motion and the intense
cold. She reached Carnegie Hall in a surprisingly
short time, but here she encountered unexpected
difficulties.

"Take you up to Mr. Halleck's studio?" said the
elevator-man, looking with surprise and suspicion
at this veiled young woman, who made such an extraordinary
request. "I can't take you up. The police
has charge, and there ain't a soul allowed to
go in but Mr. D'Hauteville."

Elizabeth was not in a mood to be gainsaid. She
placed a coin in the man's hand. "I must see
him," she said, in a hoarse whisper. "If you won't
take me up, I'll walk. I am his wife," she went on,
as he still stared at her, wondering. "I have a
right to see him."

"Well, it's the police that settles that," he rejoined,
gruffly, but still he took her up, reflecting
that, after all, it was no business of his. He brought
the elevator to a stand-still, with a shake of the head
and an anxious look towards the fatal studio, but
Elizabeth moved towards it as if she had no doubt
whatever of entering. And at the same moment,
Mr. D'Hauteville opened the door of his rooms on
the same landing, and came face to face with her.

"Miss Van Vorst!" he exclaimed, staring at her;
then, in a lower voice: "For Heaven's sake, don't
come here. Halleck is dead. Haven't you
heard?"

"Yes, I&mdash;I have heard." She looked pleadingly
at him. "Mr. D'Hauteville," she said, "take me
in to see him. I&mdash;I must see him. It was such a
287
shock. I am his wife, you know," she added. The
disclosure, which she had once so dreaded, fell from
her lips indifferently, as if it were a thing of small
importance, compared with the gaining of her purpose.

"His wife!" D'Hauteville fell back and stared
at her incredulously. Then his mind quickly
grasped the explanation of facts which had puzzled
him. He looked at her and saw that she was suffering
from terrible distress and excitement. "Do
you really wish to see him?" he said. "It would
be painful."

"Yes, I&mdash;I must see him." Elizabeth raised confidingly
her troubled eyes, and D'Hauteville apparently
could not resist their appeal. Slowly and reluctantly
he unlocked the studio door and allowed
Elizabeth to enter. The hall was empty, but from
behind the portière at the end came the sound of
voices. D'Hauteville cast an anxious glance towards
them, but he opened quickly another door, and
led the way into the bedroom, which was still and
dark, and close with a strange, oppressive atmosphere.
D'Hauteville, treading softly, drew up the
shade. Then he fell back and turned his eyes away.

Elizabeth felt no fear, though her only recollection
of death was connected with a horrible moment
in her childhood, when they had led her in trembling
to look at her father in his coffin. But now she
felt indifferent to any trivial terrors. She stood
by the bedside looking down at the dead man, and
put out her hand and touched the curls which clustered
about his forehead. He was not much
288
changed; the greatest difference which death had
made was in a certain look of dignity, which his
face had never worn in life. It was impossible,
standing there, to think of his faults, or of any harm
that he had wrought in her life. She only remembered
that he had been her first lover&mdash;nothing more.

A few moments passed, and then D'Hauteville
pulled down the shades and drew her gently from
the room. The tears were falling fast behind her
veil, and the hand that rested against his was icy
cold.

"I had better see you home," he said anxiously,
but she shook her head.

"No, no, thank you. You have been very kind,
but I&mdash;I would rather not. Mr. D'Hauteville," she
said, raising piteous eyes to his "who&mdash;who could
have done it?"

"God only knows!" said D'Hauteville, with a
sigh. "No one else, I believe, ever will."

He had rung the bell, and they stood waiting for
the elevator, when she turned to him. "It was not
I," she said, "don't ever think that it was I." And
at that moment the elevator stopped and she was
borne away, before there was time for further
words. But D'Hauteville stood paralyzed.

"For Heaven's sake," he asked himself, "why
did she say that? Who accused her?"

Elizabeth, as she went her way, was quite unconscious
of the impression her words had produced.
Her head felt confused, and after she left
Carnegie there followed a blank interval, during
which she wandered aimlessly, but found herself at
289
last, as if led by some involuntary instinct, in the
Park beside the lake, into which a few weeks before
she had thrown her wedding ring. Now, as
before, it was nearly covered with a thin coating of
ice, yet there was a strip of water visible, and upon
this her eyes fastened with a thrill of terrified fascination.
She pictured it involuntarily, closing over
her, dragging her down, blotting out all thoughts,
all feelings.... A moment of agony, perhaps,
and then? Rest, oblivion, an end of all struggle,
no more to-morrows to be faced, no more regrets....
The thought of death, the one way out, the
only remedy, swift and sure, appealed to her with
a force almost irresistible.

If only the water were not so cold!&mdash;In an instant
there swept over her, quite as inevitably, the natural,
healthy reaction; the revulsion against the icy pond,
and all the weird, uncanny, frightful, unpleasant
associations that it conjured up. Ah, she had not
the courage!&mdash;not then, at least. She closed her
eyes, shutting out the strange fascination of the
water gleaming in the pale chill sunlight, and promising
its sure and terrible relief&mdash;she closed her eyes
and turned resolutely away. A horror seized upon
her of herself and of loneliness, of the bleak desolation
on every side. She hastened, breathing heavily,
towards the entrance of the Park, her hurried foot-steps
on the crisp, hard path sounding unnaturally
loud in the wintry silence.

Chapter XXX


Several weeks later the Halleck poisoning
case was still, so far as the general public
was concerned, an impenetrable mystery.
For a day or two various clues were investigated,
with a great appearance of zeal; and then a lull fell
upon the efforts of the police. Their final investigations,
if they made any, were conducted behind
closed doors. But no result appeared from their
labors; the coroner's inquest was postponed from
week to week for lack of sufficient evidence. The
public grew impatient, and clamored that some one
should be arrested;&mdash;it did not seem greatly to
matter whom. And then there began to be strange
rumors of influence exerted to conceal the truth,
of suspicion which pointed in such high quarters,
that the police were afraid to continue their search.

These rumors were still comparatively new when
Eleanor Van Antwerp took up one day a scandalous
society journal&mdash;(one of those papers which no one
reads, but whose remarks, in some mysterious way,
every one hears about)&mdash;and came across a paragraph,
which seemed to her at once insulting and
inexplicable.

"They say"&mdash;it began with this conventional
formula&mdash;"that certain highly dramatic developments
291
are to be expected soon in the famous poisoning
case. The evidence that the District Attorney
has collected is now said to be complete and to
inculpate rather seriously a well-known beauty.
The lady is related, though on the father's side only,
to one of our old Dutch houses, and was introduced
to society, where she was before entirely unknown,
by the representative of another old Knickerbocker
family. Under such circumstances her success was
certain. Not content with taking the town by storm,
she made special capture of a certain prominent
society man and eligible parti, to whom her engagement
was announced. This gentleman has, however,
according to latest reports, left the forlorn
beauty and fled to parts unknown."

What did it mean? The hot, indignant color
rushed to Mrs. Bobby's cheek, and then, retreating,
left her deadly pale. She took the paper to her
husband, and pointing out the offending paragraph,
she stood beside him as he read it, her dark eyes
fixed intently upon his face, and seeing there, to
her dismay, more indignation than surprise.

"Well," she said, as he looked up at the end.
"Tell me&mdash;what does it mean?"

"It&mdash;the editor of that infernal thing ought to
be horsewhipped," he said, fiercely.

She put the remark aside as irrelevant. "Why,
that should have been done long ago. But what
does it mean?" she persisted, holding to the main
point.

He put the paper down with a sigh. "It means
what it says, Eleanor, I'm afraid," he said.
292

She stared at him, a shade paler, while the dread
in her eyes grew more pronounced. "Means what
it says?" she repeated. "Then it isn't merely a
wild concoction of the kind they're always inventing?"

"It's more than that, I'm afraid." Bobby rose
and began to pace up and down. "They do say
nasty things," he said, apparently addressing the
walls, or anything rather than his wife.

Her eyes followed him with an intense anxiety, as
her white lips barely framed the question: "At the
clubs?"

He nodded. "Yes, there, and&mdash;at other places
besides. At the District Attorney's, for instance"&mdash;

"You don't mean?"&mdash;she began incredulously.

"That they suspect her? Yes."

Mrs. Bobby sat down as if her strength suddenly
had failed her. "But that's absurd&mdash;impossible!"
she said, after a moment.

"Perhaps; but&mdash;it's the impossible that some
times happens." Mrs. Bobby was silent in incredulous
horror; and he went on, after a pause: "You
see, she's in a confoundedly unpleasant position.
There are all kinds of queer stories going the round.
They say now that she was secretly married to Halleck;
that he had some kind of power over her, at
least; and then having every motive to get rid of
him, being engaged to Gerard"&mdash;

"Bobby," said his wife, in a horrified tone "how
can you repeat such disgusting gossip?"

"I'm only telling you what they say," said Bobby,
apologetically.
293

"I don't wish to know it." Bobby held his
peace. "Why should she have any motive?" said
his wife, after a moment's reflection "when her engagement
was broken?"

"They say&mdash;but I thought you didn't wish to
know."

"I don't, but I suppose, I must know. What
do they&mdash;these disgusting people&mdash;say?"

"They think that Gerard found out something
which made him break the engagement. As for the
poison, that was sent before, you know"&mdash;

"Bobby," said his wife, with a little cry, "you
don't mean to suggest that she&mdash;that Elizabeth Van
Vorst"&mdash;She paused as if at a loss for words, and
Bobby concluded the sentence.

"Sent the poison?" he said, quietly. "No, I
don't suggest it&mdash;not for a second; I don't believe
it, even," he cried, with sudden emphasis, "but
there are other people who&mdash;who do both."

"Then they must be fools." Bobby made no
reply. "Where," she said, in a moment, "do they
suppose she got it&mdash;the poison?"

"That they don't know&mdash;as yet; but they know&mdash;or
they think they do&mdash;where she got the flask.
There's a shop in Brooklyn where they sell others
like it"&mdash;he stopped.

"Well," she said, "what of it? I daresay there
are a good many shops where they sell them."

"The man who keeps this particular shop, said,
I believe, that he sold one on the twenty-third of
December to a young woman thickly veiled, rather
tall and with wavy red hair."
294

"Her hair isn't red," said Mrs. Bobby, quickly.

"Some people call it so, you know," said Bobby.
She was silent.

"Hundreds of women have that sort of hair," she
said, presently. "Half the actresses in town"&mdash;

"He said it seemed to him natural."

"How should he know?" said Mrs. Bobby, contemptuously.
"And why on earth should she choose
a place like Brooklyn? I don't think she ever went
there in her life."

"She seems," said Bobby, gently, "to have done
a great many things that you&mdash;didn't think of,
Eleanor." And again his wife fell silent.

"Have they any other evidence?" she asked,
after thinking a moment, "or what they call evidence?
I might as well know the worst."

"They have her letters, which were found among
Halleck's papers&mdash;she told him to burn them, but
he didn't. They were signed 'E. V. V.' One of
them was about her engagement to Gerard&mdash;it
seemed he had threatened her, and she offered him
money to keep him quiet; the other was just a line,
asking him to meet her in the Park. It's evident
that she was afraid of him and had to keep him
supplied with funds. She sold all her jewelry, they
say, to do it."

"Ah&mdash;her jewelry!" Mrs. Bobby drew a long
breath. "That is what she did with it, then," she
remarked, involuntarily.

Bobby turned to her sharply. "You noticed,
then," he said, "that she didn't have it?"
295

"Of course. There were her pearls, which she
never wore last summer; the watch I gave her, too&mdash;I
used to feel hurt that she never carried it, but
I never suspected&mdash;Oh, what a fool I was&mdash;what
a fool! And I who thought myself so clever in
bringing about a match between her and Julian!"
She stopped and suddenly burst into tears. "I
made a nice failure of it all, didn't I?" she said.
Then in a moment, her mood changed, and she
turned upon Bobby indignantly. "Why didn't you
tell me all this before?"

"I didn't want to tell you," said Bobby, slowly,
"a moment sooner than was necessary. Personally,
I don't see the use of having all this exploited&mdash;as
a matter of fact, I'd pay a good deal to have it
kept quiet; partly for your sake, and partly because&mdash;well,
I like Elizabeth. She may not have behaved
well, but I don't think she deserves to be made
conspicuous in this way. I don't mind confessing
that I've done what I could to arrest the zeal of the
police, but I'm sorry to say, without success."

"You don't mean," she said incredulously, "that
they refused money?"

"Well, the new District Attorney is very zealous,"
Bobby explained, "and, between ourselves, I
think he wants the éclat of a sensational case. To
put a young society woman in prison, against the
efforts of all her friends, shows Roman stoicism,&mdash;or
so he thinks."

"But you don't believe," said his wife, piteously,
"you don't think it could come to that, Bobby?"
296

"To prison?" he said. "I don't know, Eleanor&mdash;upon
my word I don't know." And he began
again thoughtfully to pace up and down.

"What did Gerard say," he asked presently,
"when he wrote to you before he sailed?"

"It was just a hurried note, hard to make out.
He said the engagement was broken by her."

"Of course he'd say that. What did she tell
you?"

"That it was his wish, but he was not to blame,
and she would tell me more some other time. She
looked so unutterably wretched that I couldn't ask
any questions just then."

"Ah," said Bobby, softly. "I don't believe,
poor child! that it was her doing, Eleanor."

"If it was Julian's," she said, "he must have had
some good reason." And with that they both fell
into thoughtful silence.

"I don't see," was her next objection, uttered
musingly, "I don't see how they ever thought of
Elizabeth in the first place. It seems such a wildly
improbable idea."

"It certainly does," Bobby agreed. "Then
Elizabeth, poor child, as it happens, rather put the
idea into their heads herself. It seems that she
went to the studio the day after the poisoning and
insisted upon seeing him. She said she was his wife.
D'Hauteville saw her, I believe, but he said nothing
about it. It was the elevator man who told the
story&mdash;he took her up and he heard D'Hauteville
call her by her name. He says that D'Hauteville
took her into the studio, and when she came out
297
she was crying. And the man vows he heard her
say 'I didn't do it, don't think I did it,' or something
of the kind."

"Why, I never," broke in Mrs. Bobby, "heard
anything so extraordinary. The man must have
been drinking. It's impossible that Elizabeth could
have done such a thing. Why, it was that day&mdash;that
day"&mdash;she paused and thought&mdash;"that day
after the murder," she continued, triumphantly, "I
remember distinctly going to see her in the afternoon,
and she was ill in bed with grippe, and her
temperature very high."

"I can believe that," said Bobby, rather grimly,
"after what she went through in the morning. For
I'm afraid there's not much doubt, Eleanor, that
it's true. One of the detectives, too, saw her pass
through the hall, and I don't think that D'Hauteville
denies it. They want him to testify at the inquest,
but so far, they can't get him to say one
thing or another."

"He would deny it, of course, if it were false,"
said Mrs. Bobby, in a low voice. Her husband bent
his head. "Well," she said, rallying, "after all, I
don't see anything in that. It would be pretty
stupid, if she were really guilty, to defend herself
before she was accused. No one but a fool would
have done that, and the person who sent that poison
couldn't have been a fool. And she wouldn't have
gone near the studio; that's the last thing the real
culprit would have done."

"That's what I say," said Bobby. "It doesn't
seem on the face of it the act of a guilty woman.
298
But they have some theory of hysterical remorse,
and there is other evidence I haven't heard which
fits into that. They say that when she heard that
it had really happened she lost her head completely.
There have been such cases, you know. Oh, and
then another thing. They're comparing the handwriting
on the package with the letters"&mdash;

"The letters?" broke in Mrs. Bobby, anxiously.

"Yes, that I told you of, you remember&mdash;written
to him&mdash;they've got experts examining them now."

"Ah, well, if the experts have got hold of the
case," said Mrs. Bobby, resignedly, "we might as
well give up hope. They'd swear away any person's
life to prove a theory."

"Well, at least," said Bobby, "it's the life of a
young and beautiful girl. That really seemed to
me, when I heard all this, the only hope. Even
handwriting experts are human." But his wife
only sighed despairingly.

"I think," she said, after awhile, "I must go to
Elizabeth. I haven't seen her for several days, and
she mustn't think that her friends are giving her
up."

"You won't&mdash;tell her anything?" asked Bobby,
anxiously.

"Do you think she doesn't know?"

"She would be the last person, in the natural
order of events, to hear of it."

"Then I shall say nothing," said his wife, after
a moment's reflection. "You wouldn't, would
you?" she added, as she caught an odd look in her
husband's eyes.
299

"I&mdash;I don't know." Bobby seemed to reflect.
"If&mdash;if she were to go abroad just now," he said,
doubtfully, "it might not be a bad plan."

"Bobby!" Mr. Van Antwerp's wife faced him
indignantly. "You wouldn't have her&mdash;run away
from all this? You wouldn't have her frightened
by anything those people can threaten?" Eleanor
Van Antwerp's dark eyes sparkled, she held her
head proudly. Her husband looked at her half in
doubt, half in admiration.

"You would face it?"

"Yes, if it cost me my life."

The look of admiration on Bobby's face brightened
and then faded to despondency. "Ah, well,
you are right&mdash;theoretically, of course, but&mdash;would
Elizabeth, do you think, have the same courage?
Or, if she had, could you, knowing what you do,
take the responsibility of allowing her to face it?"

This was the doubt&mdash;the horrible doubt, which
troubled Mrs. Bobby as she drove to Elizabeth's
home, and at the thought of it her heart failed her.
Her husband had judged her rightly&mdash;she could be
braver for herself than for others. Would it not
be better, after all, to suggest to the Misses Van
Vorst the desirability of a trip abroad? She looked
thoughtfully out of the carriage window. It was a
bleak February day, and people in the street had
their coat-collars turned up against the chill east
wind. The climate of New York at this time is
detestable; a change would do any one good. She
would go herself to the Riviera and take Elizabeth
with her.
300

Mrs. Bobby had hardly reached this conclusion
before the carriage stopped in front of the quiet
apartment house in Irving Place where the Van
Vorsts were spending the winter. It was an old-fashioned
house with an air of sober respectability,
that seemed to make such wild thoughts as filled
Mrs. Bobby's brain peculiarly strained and improbable,
like the hallucinations of a fevered brain. It
was a shock, keyed up as she was to the tragic point,
to enter the peaceful little drawing-room with its
bright coal fire and general air of comfort, and to
find Elizabeth prosaically engaged in looking over
visiting-cards and invitations. And yet Mrs. Bobby
was shocked by the change in her appearance, which
every day made more apparent. Her face was haggard,
there was a deep purple flush in her cheeks;
her lips were dry and feverish, there was an odd,
strained look in her eyes. The hand she held out
to her visitor burned like fire.

"I'm so glad you came in," she said, with a wan
smile. "I've been looking over these stupid things
and my head aches. You see, I've neglected my
social duties shamefully&mdash;not sending cards, or even,
I'm afraid, answering some of my invitations. People
must think me horribly rude."

"Oh, they know you've been ill," Mrs. Bobby
answered vaguely. She sat down, all the wind
taken out of her sails, and stared wonderingly at
Elizabeth. How could she&mdash;how could she look
over visiting-cards and talk about invitations, with
this terrible danger hanging over her head? Was
it possible that she had no suspicions? And yet&mdash;did
301
not her eyes betray her? But Mrs. Bobby could
not think of any way of introducing the subject
of which her mind and heart were full, and there
was silence till Elizabeth spoke again.

"It's odd, isn't it," she said languidly, "that Mrs.
Lansdowne hasn't asked me to her ball. Have you
cards for it?"

"I&mdash;I believe so."

"Well, she has left me out," said Elizabeth. Mrs.
Bobby started and looked at her with some interest.
"I suppose she thinks," Elizabeth went on, "I&mdash;I'm
not much of an addition just now. I certainly am
not, to look at." She laughed a little, in a feeble
way. "Of course I shouldn't go," she added, "but
it isn't nice to be&mdash;left out."

"Perhaps it's a mistake," suggested Mrs. Bobby,
not very impressively. She was quite convinced to
the contrary.

"Perhaps," Elizabeth acquiesced, "but if so, several
other people have done the same thing. The
Van Aldens never asked me to their dance, and I
haven't had an invitation to a dinner for weeks.
People forget one quickly in New York, don't
they?" And she made another painful attempt at
a laugh.

"I suppose," said Mrs. Bobby, "they think you
don't want to go."

"I don't," said Elizabeth, "but they might at
least give me the opportunity of refusing." And
then there was a pause, in the midst of which Miss
Joanna entered.

"Oh, Mrs. Van Antwerp," she said, "how glad I
302
am to see you! Do tell Elizabeth that she ought to
be in bed. You can see for yourself she has fever.
It is the grippe, of course&mdash;she has never really got
over it."

"Yes," said Mrs. Bobby, looking doubtfully at
Elizabeth, "it is the grippe, of course."

"The grippe is a convenient disease," said Elizabeth,
in a low tone, "it means&mdash;so many things."
She took up a sheet of paper and began to write
hastily. "It does me good," she said "to employ
myself. And I can't stay in bed&mdash;it drives me
wild." Miss Joanna, as if weary of expostulation,
moved to the window.

"Yes, I declare," she announced, in the tone of
one who makes a not unexpected discovery, "there
are those men again. Every time I look out, one or
other of them seems to be watching the house."

"Watching the house?" repeated Mrs. Bobby,
startled.

"Yes, that's what it looks like, at least. And the
other day, when I went out, one of them stared at
me so&mdash;most impertinent. I declare, if it goes on,
we shall have to make a complaint. And one of
them followed Elizabeth&mdash;didn't he, my dear?"

"I thought he did," said Elizabeth, indifferently,
"but I didn't notice much. I have thought several
times lately that there were people following me.
Perhaps it is because my head feels so queer."

"What do the men look like?" asked Mrs.
Bobby.

"Oh, quite respectable," said Miss Joanna.
303
"They don't look like beggars, certainly. Cornelia
thought they looked rather like detectives&mdash;she said
they made her feel nervous; but that, of course, is
quite ridiculous."

"Quite ridiculous," echoed Mrs. Bobby. To
herself she was saying, "Ah, that trip abroad!"

"Eleanor has an invitation for Mrs. Lansdowne's
ball, auntie," said Elizabeth, suddenly changing the
subject, which did not seem to interest her, by the
introduction of one that evidently rankled in her
mind. "She thinks it is odd I wasn't asked. I
told you," she went on, with a bitter smile, "that
people are giving me up since my engagement was
broken off."

"But that is nonsense," remonstrated Miss Joanna,
in distress. "Tell her," she said, turning
pleadingly to Mrs. Bobby, "that that isn't so."

Mrs. Bobby started up and took Elizabeth's hand.
"I don't know," she said, speaking with strange
earnestness, "who gives you up, Elizabeth dear,
and I don't care. I never will. Remember that,
dear child. I will stand by you whatever happens."
And then, as if conscious of having said too much,
or fearful perhaps of saying more, Mrs. Bobby
swept hastily from the room, leaving her hearers
petrified.

Miss Joanna was the first to speak. "How very
strange she was!" she said, in a low voice. "What&mdash;what
do you think she meant?"

Elizabeth was staring vacantly at the door, but
at her aunt's words she turned.
304

"I don't know," she said, "what she meant, but
one thing I understand&mdash;that my social career is
ended." With a little pale smile, she swept aside
the cards of invitation, locked them into a drawer
and left the room.


305
Chapter XXXI


Mrs. Bobby regained her carriage, and
consulting her engagement book, she
ordered her coachman to drive her to
the house of one of her friends, whose "day at
home" it was. It was a sudden resolution. She had
gone about very little that winter, since she had no
longer the incentive of chaperoning Elizabeth, and
had not paid a visit for weeks, on the plea of mourning
for an uncle. But now she set her teeth and
said to herself that she must mingle with the world
to find out, if possible, what the world was saying.

Was it fancy, or did she distinguish, as she stood
in the hall of Mrs. Van Alden's house leaving cards,
amidst the hum of voices in the drawing-room,
words that bore upon her own fevered anxiety?
"Shocking affair," and "so she is really involved in
it"&mdash;surely she heard those sentences. And then
the conversation ceased abruptly as the butler drew
aside the portière and she stood for a moment on
the threshold. Her eyes were bright, her head erect;
she glanced around taking mental stock as it were
of the company. Five or six women were seated
about a blazing wood fire, with an air unusual
at functions of this kind of having come to stay and
of forming&mdash;or this again might have been her
306
fancy&mdash;a sort of council of justice. There was
Mrs. Lansdowne, to whose ball Elizabeth had not
been invited; and there was Sibyl Hartington, and
one or two others who knew Mrs. Bobby and did
not, as it happened, love her very much. "Enemies,"
she thought, drawing her breath sharply, "and discussing
Elizabeth and me! It's the same thing&mdash;I'm
sure I feel as if it were I under suspicion."
Eleanor Van Antwerp had certainly never known
such a feeling before, but her bearing had never
been more instinct with the nonchalant confidence of
a woman who seems absolutely unconscious of her
position, for the reason that it has never been questioned.

"I seem to have interrupted the conversation,"
she observed, lightly, after she had been rather
nervously greeted and kissed by her hostess, and
had taken her place in the circle. "Some one was
telling a very interesting story&mdash;I caught fragments
of it as I came in." She glanced her eye round the
group. "It was you, Kitty, I think," she said.
"Won't you&mdash;please&mdash;begin the story over again
and tell it for my benefit?"

"Kitty," thus appealed to, colored and bit her
lip. "Oh, the story isn't really worth repeating,"
she said, hastily. She had no wish to offend Mrs.
Van Antwerp, and was heartily wishing that she
had not spoken so loud. Sibyl Hartington helped
her out by observing, with her placid smile:

"It's a story about a friend of yours, my dear
Eleanor, so Kitty is afraid to tell it."

"About a friend of mine?" said Mrs. Bobby, and
307
she opened her eyes very wide. "Then there's all
the more reason," she said, decidedly, "why I should
hear it."

Her glance challenged the group, but no one
spoke and at last the hostess interposed. "My dear
Eleanor, I'm sorry you should have heard anything
about it. We were only talking about poor Elizabeth
Van Vorst, and regretting that there is all this
unfortunate gossip about her. For my part, I don't
believe there is a word of truth in what they say,
but it is certainly&mdash;uncomfortable."

"It makes it hard to know what to do," said Mrs.
Lansdowne, a woman with a deep bass voice and
an air of being not so much indifferent to, as unconscious
of other people's feelings. "I couldn't for
instance ask Miss Van Vorst to my ball while there
are these queer rumors about her. I was sorry to
leave out any friend of yours, Mrs. Van Antwerp;
but if a young woman gets herself talked about, no
matter how or why, I can't encourage her&mdash;it's
against my principles. Let the girl behave herself, I
say, and keep out of the papers. I'm sure that's
simple enough."

"It's not always so simple," said Mrs. Bobby, and
though the indignant color had rushed into her
cheeks, her tone was seraphic, "not so simple for
every one as it is for your daughters, Mrs. Lansdowne."
A subdued smile as she spoke went the
round of the circle. Fortunately Mrs. Lansdowne
was not quick in her perceptions.

"No, it's true," she admitted, "my daughters
have had unusual advantages. I can't expect every
308
one to come up to the same standard. But one has
to draw the line somewhere, and when a girl has
done such queer things as Miss Van Vorst, there
seems nothing for it but to drop her."

"But what&mdash;what has poor Elizabeth done?"
asked Mrs. Bobby, with eyes of innocent wonder,
and again there followed an awkward silence.

"Well, you know, Eleanor, they tell very queer
stories," the hostess said at last, deprecatingly. "I
never pay any attention to gossip, but these things
are sometimes forced upon one. Haven't you seen
that thing in Scandal?"

"I don't," said Mrs. Bobby, unmoved, "read
'Scandal,' Mary."

"And Chit Chat," chimed in some one else.
"There was a long paragraph in Chit Chat. It seems
that she was mixed up in some way in that dreadful
poisoning case. They say that she was actually
married to that young Halleck."

"At the same time that she was engaged to Julian
Gerard," said Mrs. Hartington, with her calm
smile. "It's no wonder that he, poor man, when
he found it out, got out of the affair as best he
could."

Mrs. Bobby looked steadily at the speaker. "As
a friend of Mr. Gerard's, Sibyl," she said, "I can
state on his authority that the engagement was
broken by Miss Van Vorst."

Sibyl Hartington's calm, faintly amused smile
again rippled across her face. "I never doubted,
my dear Eleanor," she said, "that Mr. Gerard is a
gentleman."
309

The entrance of another visitor at that moment
was not altogether unwelcome to Mrs. Bobby, who
felt that she was being worsted; but the new-comer
immediately continued the same subject.

"I've just been hearing the most extraordinary
news," she exclaimed, sitting on the edge of her
chair, and too much excited to notice Mrs. Bobby's
presence, "I heard it at luncheon. They say that
Elizabeth Van Vorst"&mdash;But here the speaker suddenly
caught sight of Mrs. Bobby, and stopped
short.

"Well, what do they say?" said Mrs. Bobby,
with rather a bitter smile. "Don't keep us in suspense,
Miss Dare, and above all, don't mind my
feelings. I would rather know the worst of this."

"Well, I don't believe there is any truth in it.
They say that she is really seriously implicated in
that dreadful poisoning case; that the police have
letters she wrote to Halleck, and all sorts of unpleasant
things. But of course it's impossible&mdash;a
girl like that, whom we all know!"

"Do we?" said Mrs. Hartington, softly. "Do
you think that we, any of us, know much about her?
You didn't, Eleanor, did you?"&mdash;turning to Mrs.
Bobby&mdash;"You just took her up in that charming,
impulsive way of yours&mdash;didn't you?&mdash;because people
in the Neighborhood didn't have much to do
with her, and you felt sorry for her?"

Mrs. Bobby made a scornful little gesture. "You
flatter me, Sibyl," she said. "I'm afraid I'm not so
charitable as all that. I 'took up' Elizabeth Van
Vorst, as you say, because I liked her, and for no
310
other reason. It was for my own pleasure entirely
that I asked her to stay with me, and I have never
regretted it."

Mrs. Hartington gave a barely perceptible shrug
of the shoulders. "I congratulate you," she said.
"It was a rash action, some people thought at the
time. A girl whom you knew so slightly, whose
mother was such an impossible person&mdash;or at least,
so they say. I don't of course," she went on, in her
soft, drawling tones, "know much about it myself,
but it does make all this gossip seem less extraordinary&mdash;doesn't
it?"

"Why, yes, of course, that accounts for it," said
Mrs. Lansdowne, looking relieved. "That sort of
thing runs in families. A girl who has a queer
mother is sure to be queer herself and get herself
talked about."

"I never thought her very good style," some one
who had not yet spoken now found courage to observe.
"Her hair is so conspicuous. I never could
understand why men seemed to admire her."

Mrs. Hartington raised her eye-brows. "Ah, the
men!" she said, with serene scorn. "She is exactly
the sort of girl who would appeal to men."

Mrs. Bobby felt that she had stayed as long as
the limit of human endurance would permit. She
rose to her feet, her cheeks were flushed, her eyes
brilliant, her voice rang out with crystal clearness.
"It's hardly necessary for me to tell you," she said,
"that Elizabeth Van Vorst is my most intimate
friend. I love her very dearly and always shall.
What her mother may have been is no affair of
311
mine. But as for the men liking her"&mdash;she turned
suddenly to Mrs. Hartington&mdash;"they do like her,
Sibyl, and I think they show good taste. But if
you mean the inference you seem to draw from
that"&mdash;she paused and drew her breath quickly&mdash;"why,
it's not very flattering, I think, to either
men or women."

Mrs. Hartington gave a short little laugh. "My
dear, I'm not drawing inferences one way or another.
I merely stated a fact&mdash;complimentary, one might
think, to your protegée. But you take things so
seriously!"&mdash;She drew herself up with an air of
some annoyance.

Mrs. Bobby's hands were tightly locked together
inside her muff, she faced the group appealingly,
her dark eyes wandering from one to the other.
"Certainly, I take this thing seriously," she said,
and there was a thrill of earnestness in her voice
which moved more than one of her hearers. "It's
no light matter for me to hear my friend spoken of&mdash;like
this. I had Elizabeth Van Vorst with me all
last winter, I feel as if I knew her like my own
sister. I believe in her implicitly, no matter what
any one may say. And if&mdash;if some of you"&mdash;instinctively
her eyes fastened upon one or two whom
she felt she was carrying with her&mdash;"if you would
try to think the best, give her the benefit of the
doubt, show that women can stand by one another&mdash;sometimes"&mdash;Her
voice faltered and she broke
off suddenly; there were tears glistening in her
eyes as she held out her hand to her hostess. "Forgive
me, Mary," she said. "I don't want to make
312
a scene. But I can't help feeling strongly, and in
this case I want every one to know exactly how I
feel." And with that she left the room quickly
before any one could speak, yet conscious as she
went of a subtle wave of sympathy, which seemed
to have made itself felt since her entrance.

"But it's useless&mdash;useless," she said sadly to her
husband when she got home. "You might as well
try to stop the course of a torrent as fight against
the world's disapproval, when it is once roused
against any poor, defenceless girl. And it isn't as
if she were a great personage, or even as if she
were still engaged to Julian! They've nothing to
gain by standing by her. Yet there were one or
two, I think, even of those women this afternoon,
who felt with me. And at least"&mdash;she consoled herself
a little&mdash;"at least they shall see that she has
friends!"

"She'll need them, poor girl. The&mdash;the inquest&mdash;I've
just heard&mdash;is coming off next week." He
took up a paper knife and played with it, while
he stole a furtive glance at his wife. "I think you
had better&mdash;prepare Elizabeth," he said.

"Prepare her?" she repeated anxiously, as he
paused.

"For some confoundedly unpleasant questions!
Yes. Have you the strength to tell her?" His eyes
questioned her anxiously. She was white to the lips,
but she met them without flinching.

"One can always find strength."

"It's confoundedly hard, I know." Bobby began
to pace up and down helplessly. "You don't
313
know how I hate to have you mixed up in all this,
Eleanor," he said. "I'd give anything to have
you out of it. Wouldn't it be better for you to go
abroad for awhile?"

"And desert Elizabeth? My dear Bobby, you
wouldn't have me do that?"

"Well, you can't help her, you know," he urged.

"I can show that I believe in her. And, thank
Heaven! social position does count for something.
It may help me to fight Elizabeth's battles."

"It doesn't count for much, unfortunately, before
the law."

"Not theoretically, no," said his wife, sceptically.
"But practically&mdash;it counts with every one and
everywhere. By the way," she added, struck with a
sudden idea, "what sort of man is the District Attorney?
I might ask him to dinner." And she
looked prepared to send the invitation on the spot.

"My dear Eleanor, I'm afraid it's too late for that
now. The thing to do now, since matters have
gone so far, is to prove Elizabeth's innocence, and
for that, the first step is to prepare her, so that she
won't be taken unawares. Her aunts too&mdash;they
must be told, I suppose. Poor things, I believe it
will kill them!"

"People don't die so easily. It would be more
merciful, I sometimes think, if they did." She sat
and thought for a moment. "I think I had better
go there at once," she said, at last, nervously. "I
couldn't sleep to-night with this hanging over my
head."

And so, for the second time that day, she drove
314
to the Van Vorsts' apartment, feeling that her unexpected
appearance in itself must prepare them for
some calamity. And indeed the telling proved
easier than she feared. She saw Elizabeth alone,
and sat holding the girl's hand, trying by many
tender circumlocutions to break the force of the
blow. But Elizabeth understood almost immediately.

"They think I sent the poison&mdash;is that it?" she
said, going at once to the point which her friend
was approaching so carefully. "Well, that isn't
so strange. Sometimes I feel," she added, wearily,
and putting her hand to her head, "as if I had done
it myself. I think I&mdash;I might have done it."

"Elizabeth, Elizabeth, what do you mean?"

"Because I wished it, you know," Elizabeth went
on to explain quite calmly. "I was married to
him, and I wished that he might die, so that no one
would ever know it, I didn't tell any one but Julian&mdash;I
wouldn't have told him if I could have helped
it. That was the reason he gave me up&mdash;because
I told him that I had been secretly married all the
time. He was angry because I hadn't told him before."

"But," interrupted Mrs. Bobby, with intense anxiety,
"you did tell him, at last?"

"Yes, of course I told him," said Elizabeth, in
surprise. "I told him New Year's Eve. Why else
should he have given me up?"

"Then," cried Mrs. Bobby, rising to her feet in
her excitement, "that seems to me an unanswerable
argument. If you had&mdash;had expected Paul Halleck's
315
death, you certainly wouldn't have told Julian
Gerard of your marriage. That's clear as daylight.
Oh, Elizabeth, how fortunate that you told him!"

"Fortunate?" said Elizabeth, listlessly. "I don't
see that it is very fortunate, since he has given me
up and will never forgive me."

"But it may save you." Elizabeth looked at her
blankly. "Oh, my dear child," cried Mrs. Bobby,
"don't you understand that they suspect you of&mdash;of
the murder?"

"You don't mean that they would put me in
prison?"

Mrs. Bobby only answered by her silence. Elizabeth
sat staring at her for a moment, then the color
rushed into her white face, her eyes flashed. "How
would they dare do that," she cried, "when I am innocent?"

"Of course you are," said Mrs. Bobby. "No one
but a fool would think otherwise. And we will
prove it, never fear. But you mustn't talk any more
of this morbid nonsense about being guilty of his
death and all that. I know what you mean well
enough, but the general public doesn't understand
such psychological subtleties. And besides, it's not
true. The guilty person had no thought of doing
you a service&mdash;be sure of that. Paul Halleck would
have died, my dear, if you had never known him.
And now keep up a brave heart, Elizabeth. Your
friends will stand by you, and when all this is over&mdash;happily
over, you will look back upon it as a bad
dream&mdash;nothing more."

Mrs. Bobby had almost talked herself into feeling
316
the confidence she expressed; but Elizabeth listened
languidly, with drooping head. All color had
faded again from her face; it looked haggard, worn;
her hands plucked nervously at some fringe on her
gown. When she wiped her eyes at the last words,
the smile she conjured up was piteous.

"It's a dream," she murmured, "that is lasting&mdash;a
terribly long time."


317

Chapter XXXII


There is an old prison well in the heart of
the city, which presents a grim, mediæval
front to the busy world outside. Elizabeth
knew that it existed, but had never seen it. She did
not know even where it was, till she found herself
condemned to spend eight months within its walls.

This was after the inquest, when the evidence
had gone as she had seen herself, very much against
her. It was a curious feeling&mdash;this bewildered perception
of a net closing round her, whose meshes she
had woven herself. The verdict of the jury was
hardly a surprise. And then they broke to her
gently the fact that bail was refused, and they
brought her across the Bridge of Sighs, the name
of which gave her an odd little thrill, into the prison.

The inmates of The Tombs are mostly of the
lowest class. Such a prisoner as Miss Van Vorst
was disconcerting to wardens and matrons alike.
The situation was unprecedented, they hardly knew
how to deal with it.

Elizabeth was placed in one of the ordinary cells;
no other indeed was to be had. It was small and
dark, and had for furniture a cot-bed, a faucet set
in the wall, and one cane chair. Light and air&mdash;what
there was of either&mdash;came in through the corridor,
318
above and below the iron grating which barred
the doorway. There was no window.

Elizabeth, to whom an abundance of light and air
had been one of the necessities of life, who had
a passion for space and luxury, for fresh, dainty
surroundings, looked about her in blank dismay.
Yet she said nothing. From the first she seemed to
school herself to a silent stoicism, which her friends
called courage and her enemies insensibility, and
which may have been a combination of both. The
last two months had been crowded with so many
startling events, so intense, conflicting a tumult of
thought and emotion, that her capacity for acute
suffering was for the moment exhausted.

Yet the mere physical horror that the cell inspired
her with was very great. The first time that the
key was turned upon her, and she was left entirely
alone, with the twilight coming on, with no power to
free herself, nothing to do but wait for the matron's
return, she felt as she had felt once when for some
childish offence, she had been locked into a dark
closet. Now as then she threw herself against the
door, trying with fierce, unreasoning efforts to force
the lock, uttering hoarse cries for help. Then the
door had been quickly opened, her aunts had let
her out with remorseful tears, and the experiment
had never been repeated. Now no help came to her,
and she was left to adapt herself to the situation as
best she might. The struggle left deep marks on
her young face, a look in her eyes which they never
afterwards lost.

There were many ways in which the prison routine
319
was softened in her favor. Social distinctions
count, as Mrs. Bobby had said, with every one and
everywhere. Money is powerful, even in The
Tombs. The warden and the other officials reaped
in those days a harvest of gold coins from Mrs.
Bobby.

A more comfortable bed, a hand-mirror, all sorts
of forbidden luxuries, found their way into Elizabeth's
cell. Neither warden nor matron apparently
recognized their existence. She was permitted to
receive her visitors alone, to have a light in her cell
after dark, to walk for an hour a day in the corridor
or the court. At these times she would see
those other women, her fellow-prisoners, huddled together
in an abject group, and feel thankful that
at least she was not obliged to mingle with them.
Her meals were served to her in her cell, and she
could order what she wanted. Her friends sent her
constantly an abundance of fruit and flowers.

The people who came to see her, and there were
many of them, used to go away wondering at her
calmness. They went prepared for tragedy, and
Elizabeth received them as she might in her own
drawing-room. They noticed no change in her,
except that her head had never been held so proudly,
and she had never looked so pale. But there were no
confidences, no tears, no consciousness apparently
of the extraordinary state of things. Even to her
aunts, even to Eleanor Van Antwerp, she maintained
this attitude of proud reserve. They could
only guess at the thoughts which lay beneath it.
There were times, indeed, when she did not think,
320
when her brain would seem dazed. In those days
she would read eagerly all the books that people
brought her; read them through from beginning to
end, but she had never any idea of what they were
about.

There was one form of reading which no one
suggested, which she did not, apparently, think of
herself. No one brought her a newspaper, and she
never asked to see one. Perhaps she did not realize
how much her case was discussed, perhaps she
realized it only too well. Her aunts were thankful
for her lack of curiosity. They could not themselves
open a paper, or enter a street-car, without an agony
of dread as to what they might see or hear.

For the yellow journals, of course, were exploiting
the affair&mdash;it was Mrs. Bobby's opinion, indeed,
that it had been started originally on their account,
for the enlivenment of a dull season. This may or
may not be true; but certainly they made the most
of it. They published Elizabeth's picture, and long
accounts of her conquests. There were pictures,
too, of her grandmother, that stately beauty whose
fame was traditional, and of old Van Vorsts who
had held important offices, and served city and state
with credit in colonial and revolutionary times.
Then, by contrast, there were accounts of her
mother's past and her mother's kindred through several
generations of moral and social disrepute. The
Neighborhood was overrun by disguised reporters
who made copious notes of local items, and took
photographs of the Van Vorst Homestead, of the
village, of Bassett Mills and even of the church&mdash;thereby
321
causing the Rector's wife nervous spasms
in her anxiety lest any of Elizabeth's moral perversions
should be laid to the account of the religious
teaching that she had received. Bassett Mills was
all a-flutter in its excitement over this gratuitous advertisement.
But in the Neighborhood&mdash;the staid,
aristocratic old Neighborhood&mdash;there was a feeling
of humiliation, a presentiment that it could never
recover from the disgrace of such notoriety.

And yet, in spite of all discredit, what a subject
for conversation&mdash;in the Neighborhood as well as
Bassett Mills! Nothing else was talked of at the
various tea-parties, of which so many had never
been given before. People who had guests took
them over on Sunday afternoons to the Homestead,
and wandered about the grounds relating the family
history, while the strangers stared with interest at
the old house, and the horse-shoe on the door. There
was a dreary look about the place for the Misses
Van Vorst were not coming back that summer, and
the old gardener left in charge had not the heart
under the circumstances to keep it in order. Grass
grew in the gravel-walks, the flowers in the garden
hung their heads, the foliage was sadly in need of
clipping. A shadow seemed to brood over house
and grounds, as in the day of old Madam Van Vorst.

In town, where there were more things to talk
about, the great poisoning case still took precedence
of all other subjects, and society was divided on account
of it into warring camps. There were those&mdash;a
very large number&mdash;who followed Mrs. Hartington's
lead, and spoke of Elizabeth as a sort of
322
adventuress, who had thrust herself into circles
which she had no right to enter; a party which
disowned her entirely and believed implicitly in her
guilt. But there was another party, smaller perhaps
but not less influential, which took uncompromisingly
the opposite side. The people who composed
it were friends, many of them, of Mrs. Van Antwerp,
and there were others who had cared for
Elizabeth for her own sake, and again others to
whom the romantic facts of the case appealed irresistibly,
inducing them to espouse her cause regardless
of reason. These all spoke of her as a suffering
martyr and regarded her imprisonment as an
outrage. They did not discuss the evidence, but
met all doubts with the one unanswerable argument
of their own intuitions.

But the first side had in point of logic, so much
the best of it! This conviction intruded itself reluctantly
on Eleanor Van Antwerp's mind, as she
looked up from an exhaustive summary of the case
for the prosecution. The article presented, in clear,
remorseless details, all the links in the terrible chain
of evidence&mdash;her hasty marriage, and then her repentance;
her efforts to buy off her husband; the
trouble she had to supply him with money; her evident
fear of his betraying her to Gerard; her refusal
to name her wedding day, till she had in sheer desperation
decided on the murder; then when the thing
was at last accomplished, her sudden remorse, her
strange actions; the rumor that she had in the first
excitement confessed her guilt before witnesses; the
description too, of the woman who had bought the
323
flask, and which fitted Elizabeth exactly in height,
coloring and general appearance; the resemblances
which the experts were said to have discovered between
her letters and the handwriting on the package&mdash;never
was chain more strongly forged! And
what, the article further demanded, had her friends
to offer in rebuttal but her social position, her youth
and her beauty?

"It's not much, certainly," Mrs. Bobby's anxiety
admitted. "And yet a good deal, too," her aristocratic
instincts involuntarily responded; "and will
have their weight with the jury," her cynicism
added. But then again despair overwhelmed her,
and she put the unavailing question: "Bobby, is
there&mdash;do you think there is any hope?"

Bobby stared back at her, his face hardly less
white than hers.

"God only knows, Eleanor! If she were just a
man, or even an ordinary woman, I should say
'no;' but for a young girl, there's always a chance.
Let her"&mdash;he dropped his hand on the table beside
him with a deep sigh&mdash;"let her look as pretty as
she can. It seems to me about the only hope."

"She won't look pretty," his wife returned, with
a little sob. "She is just the shadow of her old
self; if she stays in that place much longer, I believe
it will kill her. Bobby," she cried, with a
sudden burst of indignation, staring up at him with
tragic eyes, "if that child dies&mdash;there, it will be
murder! And yet you say the law is just!"

Bobby had said so much in the last few weeks
in perfunctory defence of the law that he was weary
324
of the subject, and so he attempted no further protestations,
but watched his wife sadly as she walked
impatiently to and fro; a slight, childlike creature,
her cheeks flushed, her eyes brilliant with impotent
anger, dashing herself as it were against impenetrable
barriers. Only once before in her life had
Eleanor Van Antwerp been confronted with an obstacle
that did not yield to her wishes. That was
when the baby died, and she had resigned herself to
what she believed to be Divine Providence. But
this seemed mere human stupidity.

"If only men were not so logical!" she exclaimed,
despairingly. "Women, if they intended to get
her off, would do it, no matter what the evidence
was; but men!&mdash;they are so bound hand and foot by
their sense of justice, their respect for law, and
Heaven knows what! that they are quite capable,
even if they believe her innocent, of finding her
guilty, just because the evidence was against her."

"Well that's what they're supposed to do,"
Bobby put in, deprecatingly, "they've got to abide by
the evidence." It was the twentieth time that he
had made this explanation, and for the twentieth
time, she brushed it aside.

"What does it matter," she demanded, "about
the evidence, when any one with common-sense
must know the girl is innocent? But I see how it
is, Bobby," she went on, her lip quivering. "You
don't really believe in her the way that I do. You
have doubts&mdash;at the bottom of your heart you have
doubts. Tell me the truth, and I'll try to forgive
you&mdash;haven't you?"
325

She stopped before him, her dark eyes, fastened
upon his, seemed to read his soul, but he answered
steadily: "Eleanor, upon my honor, I believe in that
child's innocence as you do. I'd give anything in
the world to get her off. (Yes, and I would," he
added to himself "for your sake, if she had committed
twenty murders.")

She drew a long sigh of relief. "Oh, Bobby, you
are nice," she said, gratefully. "You've been very
good to me all this time&mdash;never once saying 'I told
you so,' when the whole thing has been all my fault
for not taking your advice."

"Your fault, you poor child! How do you make
that out?"

"If I had never asked Elizabeth to stop with
me," she said tremulously, "all this wouldn't have
happened. You warned me&mdash;don't you remember?&mdash;and
you were right. I've come to the conclusion,
Bobby, that you generally are right and I
wrong."

Her tone of submission was as edifying as it was
surprising, but Bobby with unwonted quickness cut
it short. "Nonsense!" he said almost roughly.
"You were right in that case, as you generally are,
and I was wrong; and no harm would have come of
it if Elizabeth&mdash;well, I don't want to hit people
when they're down," he said, apologetically "but if
she had only been frank with us from the first, all
this wouldn't have happened. My dear"&mdash;this in
response to a reproachful look from his wife&mdash;"I
don't mean to be hard on her, but I can't hear you
blame yourself for what has been poor Elizabeth's
326
own fault, helped out by a most extraordinary train
of circumstances."

"She was to blame, certainly," faltered his wife,
reluctantly, "but I can understand&mdash;I believe I
should have done the same in her place."

"No, Eleanor," said Bobby, briefly and with
some sternness, "you would not."

"It's true," she admitted, "I don't think I could
keep a secret if I tried. But then neither apparently
could Elizabeth&mdash;to the bitter end. That is
one thing I can't understand," she went on, "why
you don't any of you attach more importance to the
fact that she told Julian herself."

"Because," said Bobby, slowly, "we have only
her own word that she did so."

"But her aunts"&mdash;began Mrs. Bobby.

"They can't know what passed between them.
What people think is that he discovered the marriage
and charged her with it. It seems improbable
that after deceiving him so long she should
suddenly repent. And of course he would shield
her as far as possible, so his version goes for nothing."

"All the same, I should like to hear it," said Mrs.
Bobby decidedly. "If I were Mr. Fenton, I should
summon him at once as witness." (Mr. Fenton
was the counsel for the defence.)

"Why, Fenton thought of it," said Bobby. "He
spoke about it to Elizabeth, and she cried out 'Oh,
not he&mdash;not he of all people' in such a way that he&mdash;well,
he thought he'd better not send for him,
for fear of discovering something that would go very
327
much against us. It did look badly, you know, that
she should dread Gerard's evidence so."

Mrs. Bobby's reply to this was unexpected. "Is
Mr. Fenton considered a clever lawyer, dear?" she
asked.

"The best that money can get," said Bobby,
somewhat taken aback. "But why, Eleanor?"&mdash;

"Oh, well&mdash;I hope he knows more about law
than he does about women, that's all. Now I say,
send for Julian at once."

"Well, you know, Eleanor, I can't help thinking
that if he knew of any evidence in her favor he'd
have turned up of his own accord before this. It
looks badly, I think&mdash;his staying away; as if he
were afraid of being questioned if he came."

Mrs. Bobby sat for a moment reflecting deeply,
her brows knit. "I don't believe," she said, suddenly,
"that he knows a thing about it. Where is
he, do you know?"

"Some one saw him ages ago in London," said
Bobby. "Goodness knows where he is now. But
in all events, he must have heard."

"I doubt it. It happened, you know, while he
was on the ocean, and by the time he had landed, the
first excitement was over, and there was nothing
about it in the papers for a long time. So that,
even if he bought an American paper, he might not
see anything about it, and the foreign ones of
course would have nothing&mdash;you know how little
interest they take in us over there. Oh, it might
easily happen&mdash;strange as it seems, that he has
heard nothing."
328

"But why is it, do you think," said Bobby, "that
Elizabeth doesn't want him here?"

"My dear Bobby, how dull men are! Of course,
she doesn't want to call upon him in a time like
this. She's too proud. But nothing will prevent
him&mdash;if I know him rightly&mdash;from coming at once,
if there is anything he can do to help her."

"Well, if you think it's any good, I'll send a
detective after him," said Bobby, with the composure
of one to whom money is no object.


329

Chapter XXXIII


The services of a detective proved imperative
in finding Gerard. His banks when
applied to by cable, regretted to reply that
they did not know his address. He had left no directions
to have his mail forwarded. Apparently
his one idea had been to efface himself and break
with some home ties. It was a proceeding which
did not altogether surprise Mrs. Bobby, who understood
the phase of mind which it indicated; but to
Mr. Fenton it was proof positive of his own suspicions,
that Gerard dreaded to be summoned as
witness on behalf of the woman whom he had once
loved.

"She is glad to have him out of the way,"
thought the astute lawyer to himself. "No doubt
he has evidence which she is afraid of. Yes, she
lied no doubt when she said she had told him herself
of her marriage, just as she lied when she said
she couldn't remember what she had done on the
twenty-third of December. She remembered&mdash;I
could see that plainly&mdash;very well." The counsel for
the defence was reluctantly convinced of his client's
guilt, but he had good hopes of saving her nevertheless,
though he did not think it was to be done by
means that were strictly legal. He said little and
330
accepted Gerard's disappearance with philosophy,
even though he did not absolutely discourage Bobby
Van Antwerp from sending a detective on his track.
It could at least, the lawyer argued, do no harm,
since he was quite certain that Gerard however
urgently summoned would not come. Bobby lost
heart and would have let the matter drop, but his
wife's influence again carried the day. The detective
started, with urgent directions from Mrs.
Bobby to find the witness at any cost, and equally
urgent directions from Mr. Fenton by no means to
find him, unless his evidence were desirable.

Meanwhile the summer came and life in The
Tombs assumed a different phase.

The atmosphere in Elizabeth's cell grew unbearable,
and the warden allowed her to spend a large
part of her time in the prison court. Here, too,
since the intense heat, the other women assembled
for an hour every day, and she was brought in
actual contact with them for the first time. The
court was large, and she could sit on the bench which
the warden had placed for her in the shadow of the
wall. And yet, though she tried to, she could not
ignore them; she found herself, little by little, observing
them, taking even some faint interest in
them. She grew to know them by name, and would
talk to some of them, asking timid questions, partly
with an instinctive desire to get away from her own
thoughts, partly with the feeling that they were human
beings, in trouble like herself. There was a
lurking sympathy in her heart for even the most
depraved. She would share with them her fruit
331
and flowers, or make little presents of one kind or
another, even though the matron, discovering this
assured her that they were in many cases quite unworthy
of her kindness.

"They won't thank you for it, Miss," she said
"they won't indeed. They're just as likely as not
to say the worst things of you behind your back."

Elizabeth stared at her thoughtfully for a moment
beneath knit brows.

"I don't know that I care about their thanking
me," she said at last, "and even if they're not
worthy, that doesn't make it any the less hard for
them, does it?"

To the matron this sentiment had a taint of immorality
and she drew herself up primly. "Why,
on that principle, Miss," she said, "there's no use
at all in good behavior." Her point of view was the
correct one, of course&mdash;at least for a prison official.
But it was natural that Elizabeth, in revolt against
the hard judgment of the world, should take the
opposite side. And certainly the women, even the
roughest of them, seemed to be grateful in their own
way for her kindness, and respected absolutely the
intangible barrier between them. There were one
or two, indeed, younger and more imaginative than
the rest, who would follow her with wistful eyes as
she passed, or flush in involuntary, awkward delight
if she spoke to them; to whom her presence in their
midst appealed irresistibly, touching some latent
sense of romance, and lending a new interest to the
prison routine. There was something wraith-like,
spiritual about her, as she grew from day to day,
332
more frail, her face more thin and wasted, her
eyes more unnaturally large and strained, and the
shadows beneath them deeper and darker. Her
gowns, since the hot weather began, were always
white, unrelieved by color even at throat or belt.
Only her hair made a gleam of brightness, the more
vivid for the pallor of her face and the grayness of
the prison walls.

It was this soft, wavy hair at which visitors to
The Tombs looked most curiously, recognizing one
of the strong pieces of evidence against her. There
was a number of visitors to The Tombs, even on
those hot summer days; people who only stared at
one prisoner and asked before they left one question
of the prison officials, which met the one answer.
The warden&mdash;a gruff old man, hardened by long
contact with the lowest offenders&mdash;seemed when his
turn came to hesitate.

"Guilty, she?" he repeated, staring up at the
questioner with his shrewd old eyes. "Well, there
ain't a guilty person in The Tombs&mdash;not to hear
them talk; but&mdash;she"&mdash;he paused a moment.
"She never says nothing; but&mdash;bless you"&mdash;carried
beyond himself by an unwonted burst of sentiment&mdash;"I'd
as soon suspect an angel from heaven."

"Ah, he has had a large fee," the more cynical
would observe as they left, and it was true. But
the canny old warden was quite capable of accepting
all the money in the world, and reserving the right
to his own opinion, which he had stated in this case
with absolute honesty. And it was shared, moreover,
333
by the entire prison,&mdash;jailers and criminals
alike.

Elizabeth grew conscious of the general sentiment
and it cheered her more than its intrinsic value
seemed to warrant. For it was based on no tangible
evidence, was the result of a hundred unconsidered,
unimportant words and actions, the effect of which,
to those who had not seen or heard them, it was
hard to explain; and it could penetrate little to the
outside world. But she felt strangely indifferent
to the outside world. Her horizon was bounded by
the prison walls.

One day, sitting dull and languid on her bench in
the shadow of the wall, she chanced to overhear
a fragment of a conversation between the warden
and a visitor. They stood within the door of the
office, and their voices came to her distinctly. "I
tell you," the warden said, apparently bringing his
argument to a conclusion, "they'll never put a
woman&mdash;let alone a young and pretty one like her&mdash;in
the electric chair."

"Ah, but if she's guilty,"&mdash;the visitor's voice demanded.
And then, with an odd grunt from the
warden, they passed on. She could not hear the
rest.

But what she had heard thrilled her with a new,
sharp pang of terror, the reason of which she could
not have explained. There was nothing in the
warden's assertion, nothing even in the visitor's protest.
She knew of course that there were people
who believed her guilty, and the man's words were
334
reassuring rather than otherwise. Yet something
in them called up before her vividly for the first time
the very danger which he disclaimed. Yes, she
was to be tried for her life! Incredible stupidity!&mdash;how
was it she had never realized it before?

There was after all nothing extraordinary, unprecedented
in the idea; it was one which had exercised
over her in times past a curious fascination.
She remembered well having read a graphic account
of the last hours of a noted criminal, everything that
he had said and done, the way in which he had met
his fate, his last words ... it all came back
to her with startling distinctness. She had tried at
the time to put herself in his place, to think how
she would have felt.... It was so futile, she
had desisted from it at last with a smile at her own
absurdity, the healthy instincts of her warm young
life asserting themselves, as they generally did,
against the occasional morbidness of her imagination.
Now, looking back on it, the whole thing
seemed one of those presentiments with which people
doomed to misfortune are visited.

Yet the idea was absurd, even now. There was
no danger, for she was innocent. That man was
guilty&mdash;or so the papers said. She remembered
that he had protested his innocence&mdash;to the end.
And perhaps he had spoken the truth.

What did the papers say about her own case?
The evidence against her was strong&mdash;she had always
vaguely known that. But&mdash;what was it the
man had said?&mdash;they'd never put a woman, guilty
335
or innocent, in the electric chair. But what woman
would accept her life on such terms as that? Elizabeth
raised her head with that characteristic, proud
little motion which not all the humiliations of prison
life had availed to break her of entirely. "I would
rather die," she said to herself, "I would rather die."

And then she remembered how she had shrunk
from death&mdash;that morning months ago in the park.
She felt again the intense physical repulsion, the instinctive
clinging to life, the dread of the unknown....

That evening when the younger matron&mdash;the one
she liked the best&mdash;came with her dinner, she put
her through a series of questions, which embarrassed
the kind woman not a little. Had she ever, Elizabeth
demanded, seen people who were condemned
to death and how had they behaved? Did they
seem frightened, or were they calm and brave?
Were they&mdash;did the matron really believe that they
were guilty, beyond possibility of doubt?

"Are innocent people ever condemned," asked the
girl, sitting huddled together on her bed and staring
at the matron with haggard eyes. "Surely there
couldn't be&mdash;you don't suppose there could be&mdash;such
a terrible mistake?"

"I"&mdash;The matron's voice suddenly failed her, her
eyes filled with tears. "Heaven knows I hope not,
Miss," she said and went out hastily.

Elizabeth sat still, staring before her. "She believes
me innocent&mdash;but she is afraid I will be found
guilty." A little shudder passed through her, in
336
spite of the intense heat. And then again the dull
cloud of weary indifference descended upon her, and
she said to herself that she did not care.

But as time went on, she knew that this was false.

A few days later Mrs. Bobby came back, after
spending a week in the country much against her
will. It seemed to her that Elizabeth looked much
worse than when she saw her last. She sighed as
she realized, more emphatically than ever, how much
of the girl's beauty had left her with that wealth
of color and outline which had been its most striking
characteristic. Certainly any one who judged of
her by the famous picture, taken in her first bloom,
would be wofully disappointed now. There was
only the soft sweep of the hair, and the strange
shadow in the eyes&mdash;of which the first premonition
as it were had somehow crept into the picture&mdash;but
for these points of resemblance one would hardly
know her for the same woman.

"No," Mrs. Bobby reflected, "they won't acquit
her for her beauty." But aloud she talked cheerfully,
giving the Neighborhood news&mdash;what there
was of it, skimming the cream of her letters from
friends at gayer places&mdash;profoundly uninteresting
just then, and mocking the scene about them with
its frivolous incongruity&mdash;but what matter. Anything
to keep going the ball of conversation! But
at last, in spite of herself, there came a pause.

It was intensely hot. The sun beat down upon
the rough uneven stones which paved the prison
court, it baked the wall against which the two
women leaned. Before their eyes there rose up
337
sharply the walls of the men's prison, and beyond
a fragment of the Court-house, with which the
Bridge of Sighs formed a connecting link, invisible
from where they sat. A little way off, in a small
circle of shade, a group of women prisoners gathered
silent, inert. A great stillness brooded over
the place, broken only by the buzzing of flies and the
noises in the street, which sounded dreamily as if it
were many miles away. A man was crying "Strawberries,
fresh strawberries!" and his voice floated
in to the prison, bringing with it a tantalizing suggestion
of coolness and freedom and green fields.

Involuntarily Elizabeth made a gesture of weariness,
and raised to her parched lips the great bunch
of roses, fresh from the country, which Mrs. Bobby
had brought. They already hung their heads.

"I suppose," the girl said dreamily, her eyes
half shut, "our flowers must be all out at the Homestead.
It always looks so pretty there now, before
the heat has lasted too long. I can see it&mdash;the
river with the sails on it, and the fields covered with
daisies&mdash;they must be out now&mdash;ah, and the wild-roses!"&mdash;She
drew a long breath. "Oh, I am
sick sometimes for a sight of it all," she broke out
with sudden vehemence. "I'd give anything to
lie down in the grass with the trees over me, and the
cool wind in my face, and so&mdash;sleep"&mdash;Her voice
sank away, she made a weary gesture. "I'm so
tired," she said, "I'd like to sleep forever."

"My dear child." Mrs. Bobby caught her breath,
a mist of tears in her eyes. "Don't you ever sleep
here?"&mdash;she asked tentatively after a moment, and
338
Elizabeth answered in the same dreary way, unconscious,
apparently, that she was departing from her
usual reserve.

"No, I don't sleep often," she said, "especially
since the nights have been so hot. But when I do"&mdash;she
paused and stared reflectively before her,
while the shadow in her eyes grew deeper. "There's
a dream that haunts me now," she said at last,
"whenever I fall asleep. I dream about my trial,
and&mdash;it always goes against me. I stand there all
alone, the judge pronounces sentence, and I&mdash;I try
to speak, I try to tell them that I'm innocent, but&mdash;the
words won't come&mdash;I wake up half strangled"&mdash;she
broke off shuddering. "Ah, you can't imagine
how horrible it is," she said, "worse even than&mdash;lying
awake."

Mrs. Bobby was silent for a moment, but when
she spoke her voice was steady. "It's a horrible
dream," she said, "but it's impossible&mdash;quite impossible
that it should come true. You won't be
left alone, we shall all stand by you, you will be acquitted
surely&mdash;surely"&mdash;in spite of herself, her
voice suddenly faltered, in a way that belied her
words.

"You think so?" Elizabeth said, quickly. "You
hope so. But&mdash;if you should be mistaken?" She
put out her hand and grasped Mrs. Bobby's wrist.
"Tell me the worst," she said. "I'd rather know it.
Is there much danger, do you&mdash;in your heart of
hearts, do you think that I shall be acquitted?"
Involuntarily her grasp tightened, her strained, dilated
eyes searched her friend's face with a look that
339
seemed to compel only the truth&mdash;to tolerate no
evasions. And Eleanor Van Antwerp, with all her
courage, could not meet it. She turned her face
away with a little sob.

Elizabeth sat rigid for a moment, waiting for the
answer that did not come; then her fingers relaxed
their hold, she took her hand away and sank back
against the wall.

There was a long silence. The noon-day sun
crept towards them, dazzling the eyes, a few flies
buzzed aimlessly about. Upon Eleanor Van Antwerp's
mind the prison court, as she saw it then,
baking in the noon-day heat&mdash;the group of women
huddled together, the rags of some, the tawdry
finery of others, the look of dogged misery on their
coarse faces&mdash;the whole scene impressed itself, calling
up always in after years a sense of powerless
despair.

At last Elizabeth turned to her, and a faint smile
hovered about her white lips.

"Do you know," she said, "did the warden show
you? in that corner there they have&mdash;the old scaffold&mdash;what's
left of it, at least. They keep it as
an interesting relic. Oh, he wouldn't show it to
me"&mdash;she smiled again painfully&mdash;" he's too considerate&mdash;I
heard him telling one of the visitors.
They don't have anything of the kind now, he said,&mdash;there
is&mdash;Sing Sing and the electric chair. And
that is&mdash;or so they say&mdash;more merciful. But is it&mdash;do
you really think it can be?" She paused and
stared up at Mrs. Bobby with eyes full of a dawning
terror. "To have a hood put over one's face," she
340
went on, her voice trembling, "that's how they do it,
isn't it?&mdash;to wait&mdash;wait for the shock." ...
She stopped, the look of terror in her eyes grew
deeper. She lifted the roses from her lap and held
them up before her face, as if to shut out, with their
color and fragrance, some horrible vision. "Oh,
I see it day and night," she said, "day and night!
If I see it much longer, I shall go mad."

Mrs. Bobby's hand tightened convulsively upon
hers.

"Elizabeth, my dear," she cried, "you mustn't
think of such possibilities. It could never&mdash;come to
that, they would never&mdash;carry their cruelty to that
extent"&mdash;Her voice faltered.

Elizabeth put down her roses and looked up at
her. Her face showed recovered self-control.
"Why&mdash;because I'm a woman?" she asked, with a
pale little smile. "That's what the warden said&mdash;that
they wouldn't condemn a woman to death. But
even if they&mdash;stopped short of that, would imprisonment&mdash;would
this sort of thing, or worse"&mdash;she
swept her hand with a comprehensive gesture round
her&mdash;"wouldn't death, on the whole, be better?"

And Mrs. Bobby could not answer, for she
thought in her heart it would be&mdash;infinitely better.

But in a moment she rallied her energies.

"Elizabeth," she said, "there's no necessity to
consider&mdash;either alternative. I believe firmly that
we shall get you off. But in order to do it you
must help us&mdash;to defend you. You seem indifferent
about it; Mr. Fenton complains that you keep
things back. You can't afford to trifle&mdash;tell us
341
everything. Isn't there"&mdash;she leaned forward
eagerly and grasped Elizabeth's hand&mdash;"doesn't
Julian Gerard know something that would help us?"

She felt Elizabeth start and shiver; then stiffen
into sudden rigidity. The hand she held was withdrawn,
and with the action the girl seemed to release
herself, mentally and physically, from her
grasp.

"I don't know," she said, and her voice was cold,
almost as though she resented being questioned, "I
don't know why you think that."

"I don't think&mdash;I feel it! There is something
that he can say." Mrs. Bobby's eyes seemed to
challenge a denial. Elizabeth met them with a
look of defiance.

"There is nothing," she said. "He knows nothing;
or if he did"&mdash;she lowered her voice with a
sudden change of tone&mdash;"if he could save me, I'd
rather die than have him sent for."

"Ah&mdash;you'd rather die?" Mrs. Bobby caught
her breath. "And you think that is fair&mdash;to yourself,
to your aunts, to us all?"

"I don't know." The girl's voice had the ring of
weary obstinacy that suffering will sometimes assume.
"I only know I don't want him&mdash;sent for."

Mrs. Bobby seemed to reflect. "We can't send
for him," she said at last, "we don't know where
he is."

Elizabeth started. "You don't," she repeated,
in a low voice, "know where he is?"&mdash;

"No, he left no address. His mail is at his
banker's&mdash;they don't know where to forward it."
342

Elizabeth turned her face away. "Ah, I see,"
she murmured, "he doesn't wish to be reminded
of&mdash;anything at home." A pale cold smile flitted
across her white face. "It is better so," she said,
firmly, "far, far better. I am glad that he is away
and that there is no use in sending for him."

"But if there were"&mdash;all Mrs. Bobby's self-control
could not keep the tremor from her voice&mdash;"if
there were, Elizabeth, isn't there something that he
could testify in your favor? Do tell me, dear,"
she urged; the girl sat silent. "You see I have
guessed it&mdash;it can do no harm for me to know what
it is."

Elizabeth spoke at last, low and hesitatingly.
"He knows that on the twenty-third of December,
when&mdash;when that man said he saw me in Brooklyn,
I was with him&mdash;with Julian. I went out that morning,
meaning to do some shopping, but I met him
accidentally. He persuaded me to go up to the
Metropolitan Museum&mdash;there was a picture he
wanted to show me. We were there some hours.
And&mdash;and that is all."

"And that was," said Mrs. Bobby breathlessly,
"on the twenty-third of December. You are sure?"

"Quite sure," said the girl listlessly, "but what
difference does it make? I wouldn't tell Mr. Fenton&mdash;I
said I couldn't remember what I did that day,
and I wouldn't tell you now, if I thought that you
could send for him. You can't send for him, can
you?" She looked at Mrs. Bobby with sudden
alarm. "You really don't know where he is?"

"Upon my word and honor," Mrs. Bobby assured
343
her, "I don't." And then she said little more, but
kissed Elizabeth presently, bade her keep up her
courage, and left sooner than she generally did.

"No, I don't know where he is," she said to herself,
as the hansom bore her swiftly up-town, and
she stared out absently at the deserted streets. "We
don't know, but please God, we shall soon. If only
that man finds him, if he can only get him here in
time."


344

Chapter XXXIV


This was in the early summer; and Elizabeth's
trial was to be in November. The
time approached, and nothing had been
heard of Julian Gerard. Efforts were made to postpone
the trial, that this important witness might
have time to appear. But the influence of people
like the Van Antwerps, which seems in some ways
all-powerful, is in others curiously slight. The
District Attorney was acting in the interests of the
yellow journals and they, according to their own account,
in the interests of the people, which required,
as they set forth in high-sounding editorials, that no
more favor should be shown to Miss Van Vorst
than to the lowest criminal.

After all, the girl's health had suffered so severely
from the long confinement that it seemed a cruelty
to lengthen it, even with the hope of Gerard's return.
Mr. Fenton himself was of opinion that the
trial should not be postponed. He had done his
best for his client, though hampered more, perhaps,
than he realized by his secret doubt of everything
she said. He did not believe in this alibi, which she
had trumped up, as he decided, when the one person
who could confirm or deny it was safely out of the
way. Yet he tried to find some other witness who
345
remembered, or imagined having seen her at the
Museum on the morning when she was supposed to
have been in Brooklyn. No such person could be
found. The case for the defence was lamentably
weak. Mr. Fenton admitted the fact to himself
with a shrug of the shoulders, and fell back philosophically
on his conviction that no jury would send
a young woman of Elizabeth's position and attractions
to the electric chair.

Perhaps the person most to be pitied in those days
was Miss Cornelia, who had been summoned as
witness for the prosecution to corroborate the testimony
of Bridget O'Flaherty, her former waitress,
as to her niece's words and manner on the morning
after the murder. The poor lady was in a pitiful
state of agitation. "What shall I say?" she asked,
looking appealingly from one to the other of Elizabeth's
friends and advisers.

"Say anything," said Mrs. Bobby, hastily, "any&mdash;any
lie that you can invent."

She stopped. Miss Cornelia drew herself up with
dignity. "I don't think our child's cause can be
helped by&mdash;by lies, Mrs. Van Antwerp," she said.

Mrs. Bobby felt herself rebuked. "Well, I am
not given to lies myself, as a rule," she explained,
apologetically, "but in a case like this it seems to me
that the end justifies the means. It's a doctrine
brought into discredit, I know, by the Jesuits, but
still it seems to have a certain foundation in common-sense."

"I don't know anything about the Jesuits," said
Miss Cornelia, with some stiffness, "but I shall try
346
to act as our Church would advise, even&mdash;even if
Elizabeth"&mdash;here her voice broke.

"I think," said Bobby Van Antwerp, coming to
the rescue, "that Miss Cornelia is right, Eleanor.
It is much better to tell the exact truth, and Fenton
will make the best of it.&mdash;Good Heavens," he said
afterwards to his wife, "you don't suppose that the
poor lady could invent a plausible story, or even
keep back anything that wouldn't be brought out in
cross-examination and make a worse effect than if
she gave it of her own accord!"

But upon Miss Cornelia the opposite side of the
question was beginning to make an impression. Her
mind moved slowly. It was not easy for her to
break from old tradition. Her conscience had
hitherto recognized the broadly drawn line between
right and wrong; no indefinite, subtle gradations.
As she had said once to Elizabeth, fully meaning it,
one could always do right if one tried. But if&mdash;if
one could not tell what the right was?...

Miss Joanna, sitting opposite to her in the twilight,
broke the silence hesitatingly. "I suppose,
sister," she said, "I suppose you remember&mdash;exactly
what the poor child said&mdash;that morning? You
haven't"&mdash;Miss Joanna caught her breath&mdash;"you
haven't forgotten?" There was a note of entreaty
in her voice.

Miss Cornelia could see it so plainly; the breakfast
table and the paper with those startling headlines,
and the look on Elizabeth's face, when she had
made that extraordinary assertion. A confession of
guilt! That was the way in which it would be construed&mdash;there
347
seemed no way out of it. Miss Cornelia
did not think that the most merciful jury could
acquit her after that. And yet the child was innocent&mdash;Miss
Cornelia knew that as surely as she knew
that the Bible was inspired. Was it reasonable, was
it right that she should be required to give evidence
against her? Over Miss Cornelia's mind there
swept a sudden, sharp sense of injustice, a passionate
rebellion against fate.

But a life-long habit of truth-telling is hard to
overcome. She answered Miss Joanna after a moment.
"I&mdash;I haven't forgotten, sister," she said,
and the hot tears scorched her eyeballs.

Miss Joanna put away her knitting with a hopeless
sigh. "Well, of course, sister, you must speak
the truth," she said, drearily, "but&mdash;it does seem
hard." Then she went out of the room, crying
quietly.

Miss Cornelia sat motionless in the twilight, while
that new tumult of rebellion still raged within her.
Ah, yes, it seemed more than hard&mdash;it seemed cruel,
unjust, that such a thing should be required of her.
Those strange people, the Jesuits, whom she had
always held in horror, had some reason on their side
after all. There were cases to which the simple,
old-fashioned rules of right and wrong did not apply,
which were extraordinary, unprecedented....
Miss Cornelia could not help asking herself&mdash;with
a thrill of self-condemnation, indeed, and yet another
feeling which defended the question&mdash;whether
in certain circumstances, the wrong were not more
to be commended, wiser, better than the right.
348

She spent a sleepless night, thinking it over.
The whole foundations of her life, of her faith
seemed shaken. She looked the next morning so
exhausted, when she went down as usual to The
Tombs, that Elizabeth at once divined that some
new misfortune had happened, and it was not long
before she drew it out of her.

She sat for a long time very still, one hand clasping
Miss Cornelia's, the fingers of the other tapping
on the ledge of the wall beside her.

"Of course, auntie," she said at last, quietly,
"you must tell exactly what happened. There's no
good to be gained by lies; at least"&mdash;she made an
attempt at a smile&mdash;"my own success in that line
hasn't been very striking. I was a little out of my
head that morning, and I don't remember exactly
what I said! but whatever it was"&mdash;she raised her
head proudly&mdash;"I don't want anything kept back.
Let them know the whole truth; then, if they condemn
me, well and good. At least I shan't have
anything"&mdash;her voice faltered&mdash;"anything more
to reproach myself with."

"Elizabeth!" The older woman gazed up at her
admiringly. "You are so brave&mdash;you are a lesson
to me! But you&mdash;you don't realize, my darling&mdash;"
sobs choked her voice.

"Oh, yes&mdash;I realize." A pale smile flitted across
the girl's face. "I have realized&mdash;quite clearly&mdash;all
these months. But that's no reason, auntie, why
you should save me by lies."

And then she turned the subject, and began to
talk calmly enough, about one of the women prisoners,
349
in whose case she took a keen interest. Nothing
more was said about her own affairs. She had
relapsed, since that conversation months before with
Mrs. Bobby, into her old reserve, and spoke very
little of herself. The cooler weather was helping
her. She seemed stronger, and always quite calm.
Miss Cornelia went away, feeling rebuked for her
own cowardice. Elizabeth was right, she thought
with a pang of self-reproach; nothing but the truth
must be told in her defence. But meanwhile Miss
Cornelia tried to reconcile two opposite instincts;
offering up day and night two apparently irreconcilable
petitions; that she might be enabled to speak
the truth exactly, and yet do no harm to her niece's
cause.


350

Chapter XXXV


It was the first day of Elizabeth's trial. She
could hardly realize that it had come&mdash;this
event which they had anticipated so long,
the thought of which had lately crowded out every
other. There was nothing alarming about the
present proceedings&mdash;the appearance of one jury-man
after another, generally followed in each case
by a peremptory challenge. One was objected to
because he was thought to have formed a favorable
opinion, another an unfavorable one, and still another
because he was apparently incapable of forming
any opinion at all. If she had not been on
trial for her life, she might have thought it dull.

Her gaze wandered to that wide court-room
window opposite, from which she could see an expanse
of roofs, flag-staffs and chimneys, full of
charm and excitement after the unbroken outline of
blank walls, which for many months had bounded
her view. Then, forgetting herself, she glanced
about the room, quickly turned and shrank back,
while the color rushed into her white face. There
were some women whom she knew, thickly veiled,
in the crowd behind her&mdash;women who were against
her. Those who were her friends had the consideration
to stay away. And there were others
351
whom she did not know, who crowded as close to the
bar as they could, eying her with eager curiosity,
making remarks about her in a stage whisper. As
the heroine of this sensational case, she was a disappointment
both in dress and appearance.

"Well, her hair waves prettily"&mdash;the words came
distinctly to Elizabeth's ears in a lull in the proceeding&mdash;"but
that's about all. I don't see why she
was ever called a beauty, do you?"

"Why, no, indeed. Her features aren't regular&mdash;not
a bit. And isn't she thin and white!"

"Hush!" a kindlier voice broke in, suppressing
the others. "It's no wonder, poor thing. Most
people would lose their looks, if they'd been through
what she has."

A pang shot through Elizabeth none the less distinct
because the reason was, in view of what
was going on, so trifling and absurd. She had
dressed herself that morning with unusual care, resolved
to present as far as possible an undisturbed
front to the world; and she had not realized that the
plain black gown, and the unrelieved sombreness of
the black hat, which would once have thrown into
more dazzling relief her fresh young beauty, now
emphasized with startling plainness the change in
her appearance. For a moment, the fact forced
itself upon her and hurt even then. When a woman
has always been regarded as a beauty, it is hard to
become accustomed to a different point of view.
After all, what difference did it make? She had
not realized the effect which her looks were supposed
to produce on the jury.
352

For a while the prospect of any jury at all
seemed dubious. The hours passed, the day came
to an end, and there were exactly two men in the
box. It was not till the end of the third day that
the number was complete&mdash;twelve most unhappy
men, whose faces Eleanor Van Antwerp scanned
eagerly. Some, she decided, were kind; others&mdash;too
logical; all of them were more or less intelligent.
There were one or two, she thought, to
whom the pathos of Elizabeth's pale and faded looks
might appeal with an eloquence that fresh coloring
and rounded curves would have lacked entirely.
Upon these men she based her hopes.

And so the trial, once fairly started, dragged on
its weary length. Mrs. Bobby spent her days there,
sitting beside Elizabeth; her whole life, just then,
seemed bounded by the court-house walls. She had
no interest in anything outside. And Elizabeth's
aunts, too, came every day. It was pathetic to see
these timid, elderly women, plunged for the first
time in their sheltered lives into this fierce glare of
publicity, under which they bore up unflinchingly,
in the effort to show to all the world their firm
faith in their niece's ultimate acquittal.

As for Elizabeth, she had little hope; but neither
had she, except at times, any great fear. The worst
had been that first day, and now she was used to
being stared at; used even to the thought that she
was being tried for her life. The scene and its
accessories&mdash;the listening, eager crowd behind her,
the judge before her with his impassive face, in
which she thought she could perceive, now and again&mdash;or
353
did her hopes deceive her?&mdash;a gleam of sympathy;
the jury weary but resigned, the reporters
taking notes, scanning her with eyes that noted every
detail of her manner and bearing, placed upon them
Heaven knows what construction! Bobby Van Antwerp
moving restlessly about, holding long conferences
with the lawyers; her counsel and the District
Attorney wrangling, glaring at each other over
the heads of unfortunate witnesses&mdash;the whole thing
lost its terrors, grew to be an accepted part of her
life's routine.

The evidence at first was technical. There was
much she did not understand&mdash;she wondered if the
jury did. There were the doctors, showing with
many long words and tedious explanations, with
what sort of poison the murder had been committed;
and then there were the handwriting experts, with
still longer words and more tedious explanations.
Now&mdash;what was it that they had brought out?
Those unfortunate letters which she remembered so
well having written, in great haste and anxiety.
The experts were pointing out numerous points of
resemblance between them and another piece of
paper, which she had never seen before. And now
it was the secret marriage they were proving&mdash;though
what was the use of that, when no one denied
it? The question of motive was absolutely
clear; the District Attorney had expatiated upon it
at great length in his opening speech.

All this Elizabeth grasped more or less distinctly.
She realized that the evidence was strong against
her. But she could not, weak and dazed as she was,
354
keep her mind on it. The voice of the witnesses
would grow indistinct, a mist would pass over the
anxious faces around her, a lull would come in the
nervous tension of the atmosphere; the blue sky,
which she saw from the window, would seem very
near, and she would float off into phases of oblivion,
from which she would be roused, perhaps, by a touch
on her arm, or a voice in her ear. "Listen, darling,
that was a point in your favor," her aunts or
Eleanor Van Antwerp would say.

These points were few and far between. But
there was one which Elizabeth understood&mdash;she
hoped that the jury did.

Mr. Fenton was examining one of the medical
experts for the prosecution, a man who had had
large experience in poisoning cases. The counsel
for the defence was putting him through series of
questions, the drift of which was not altogether
plain. What sort of a crime did he consider poisoning?
An atrocious one, was it not?&mdash;generally committed
by hardened criminals? Had the witness
ever been in contact with a case of poisoning where
the whole scheme had been concocted and carried out
by a girl of twenty, far removed by education,
friends and antecedents from any connection with
crime? No, the witness could not, in his own experience,
recall any such case, but he had no doubt
that it had been known, though he agreed in response
to Mr. Fenton's next question, that it would
be slightly abnormal. And here the District Attorney
interposed with one of those objections which
each lawyer seemed to make mechanically, whenever
355
a question proved inconvenient to his side; but the
Judge decided in favor of Mr. Fenton, and he went
on imperturbably, shifting his ground a little.

"Poisoning is a crime&mdash;don't you think so?&mdash;that
calls for a great deal of thought and calculation?"

"Yes," the witness thought it would undoubtedly.

"The person who planned it would have plenty of
time to consider the consequences?"

The witness responded: "I should think so."

"He or she&mdash;whoever it was that planned it&mdash;would
be probably of a cold-blooded and calculating
disposition?"

"Probably."

"And not likely, do you think so?&mdash;to suffer
from hysterical remorse as soon as the act was accomplished?"

Here the opposing counsel again intervened, and
was again silenced by the Judge. Mr. Fenton repeated
his question.

"I ask you," he said, addressing the witness with
a certain solemnity, "as a man who has had experience
with criminals and human nature, whether
you think it likely that a woman, strong-minded and
cold-blooded enough to commit this diabolical crime,
on hearing of its accomplishment&mdash;a thing she has
been expecting for days&mdash;would be seized with a
fit of hysterical remorse, would utter wild, incriminating
words, in the presence of&mdash;no matter
whom, any one who chanced to be present, and
would rush up at once to look at the body of the
man whom she had murdered?"
356

The witness hesitated. "It&mdash;it doesn't seem
likely," he admitted at last.

"It would be much more, don't you think," said
Mr. Fenton quietly, "like the conduct of an innocent
woman, who was suffering from a nervous
shock, and had no thought of controlling her actions
because she had no idea of being suspected?"

The witness, after a long pause: "Yes, it&mdash;would
certainly seem so."

"It certainly does," said Mr. Fenton. "Thank
you, doctor. I have no more questions to ask."
And he sat down with the air of one who has scored
a point.

Thereupon the prosecution, as if to prove the
strength of the evidence which he had anticipated,
placed upon the stand Bridget O'Flaherty, formerly
maid-servant to the Misses Van Vorst, who swore
upon her solemn oath that the prisoner had in her
hearing declared herself guilty of the murder of
Paul Halleck. Yes, those were her very words, the
maid declared&mdash;"that she had killed him," and she
had added that "it had come at last&mdash;just as she
despaired of it" or something of the kind, referring
no doubt to the fact that Halleck had kept the poison
some time before taking it. The woman's testimony
was full and circumstantial, and she gave the impression
of telling the truth.

Mr. Fenton, on cross-examination, proved that
she had been dismissed without a character from the
services of the Misses Van Vorst, also that she had
been paid for her evidence by a yellow journal. Its
357
effect was distinctly undermined when he permitted
her to leave the stand. And with that the
prosecution called upon Miss Cornelia to corroborate
the maid's statement.

Miss Cornelia was deathly white; her head shook,
her thin, silvery curls fluttered, as if they had caught
the infection of her own nervousness. In one hand
she grasped her smelling-salts desperately, with the
other she revolved in an agitated way a small black
fan. A murmur of sympathy ran through the court-room
as she took her place. Even the District Attorney
seemed sorry for her and put his opening
questions with unwonted gentleness. His tone was
still bland when he came to the important point&mdash;had
she noticed anything peculiar in her niece's
manner on the morning after the murder?

Miss Cornelia's answer was low, but it was quite
audible. "She was&mdash;shocked, naturally."

"Naturally. But did she seem surprised?"

Miss Cornelia's answer was this time still lower,
and given with more hesitation. "I&mdash;I think so."

"You mean you are not sure?"

"I&mdash;I was so upset myself"&mdash;began Miss Cornelia.

"That you did not notice?"

"No, I&mdash;I did not notice," said Miss Cornelia,
relieved.

"You thought that her manner was unremarkable,
and simply what you might have expected
under the circumstances?"

"Yes, I&mdash;I thought so," said Miss Cornelia. She
358
added to herself the mental reservation that she had
no idea what sort of manner under the circumstances,
she should have expected.

The District Attorney assumed a more impressive
manner. "Miss Van Vorst," he said, "do you believe
in the sacredness of an oath?"

"Yes, I&mdash;I certainly."

"You would not speak anything but the truth?"

"No," said Miss Cornelia, this time more firmly.

"Then I ask you," said the District Attorney,
suddenly drawing himself up to his full height, and
fixing his eyes upon her, "I ask you, on your sacred
oath, did your niece, or did she not, on the morning
after the murder of Paul Halleck, say to you
that she had killed him, or words to that effect?"

There was a long silence. Miss Cornelia looked
desperately about her; at the Judge, whose face
showed more than ever a touch of human sympathy;
at Mr. Fenton, white with anxiety, trying to telegraph
a hundred things which she could not understand;
at the jury, bending eagerly forward; then
back at those most interested,&mdash;her sister in an
agony of suspense, Mrs. Van Antwerp flushed and
trembling in her vain desire to intervene. Lastly,
Miss Cornelia's haggard eyes sought Elizabeth herself;
the girl was sitting white and rigid, motionless
as a statue, her hands clenched, her eyes resolutely
bent upon the floor. If it was a terrible moment
for her; how much worse was it for the aunt
who had brought her up, who was now called upon
by a refinement of cruelty to destroy what seemed
to be her only chance. Oh, for the courage&mdash;it
359
seemed to her almost noble!&mdash;to utter one good lie!
But there were the lynx-like eyes of the District Attorney
fixed upon her, there was the oath she had
taken, weighing upon her conscientious soul....
Suddenly she felt, with a sense of despair, that her
silence had already spoken louder than speech.
And, even as the thought passed through her mind,
her answer framed itself on her lips and seemed to
be uttered without her own volition; one word,
barely audible, but caught at once and registered by
twenty reporters, while a suppressed sigh went the
round of the court-room.

"Yes."

"Thank you," said the District Attorney. "That
is all I wished to know."


360

Chapter XXXVI


There was still cross-examination.

Mr. Fenton, too, began with unimportant
questions. He gave Miss Cornelia,
who looked ready to faint, time to recover herself
a little. The questions he asked were easy to answer.
Had her niece, in the course of her education,
given them much trouble, had she ever deceived
them, kept anything from them before this
fatal secret? Ah, no, no! Miss Cornelia gave
her answers tremulously, yet with a fervent relief,
an eager desire to make herself heard throughout
the court-room.

"Then with your knowledge of your niece's character,"
Mr. Fenton asked, speaking almost carelessly,
"you didn't think of her as the sort of person likely
to commit a crime?"

Miss Cornelia drew herself up with sudden dignity
and her voice was plainly audible, and without a
tremor. "Most certainly not," she said.

"Then how," inquired Mr. Fenton calmly, "did
you account for her extraordinary assertion that
she had committed this murder?"

Miss Cornelia hardly hesitated. "I thought she
was out of her mind," she said. "I couldn't account
for it in any other way."
361

"It never occurred to you for a moment that it
was true?"

"Not for a moment." The words came out indignantly.

"You naturally did not suppose that were she
really guilty, she would proclaim it quite so readily
as that?"

Miss Cornelia stared. "I never," she said,
simply, "thought of such a thing as her being
guilty."

"But you asked her, did you not, for some explanation
of her words?"

"I asked her," faltered Miss Cornelia, "what she
meant by saying such a dreadful thing. And she
said&mdash;she said"&mdash;&mdash;

"Yes," said Mr. Fenton, encouragingly. "Take
your time and tell us the exact truth. What did she
say?"

"She seemed to be rather dazed&mdash;She said that
she had wished so much for it to happen that when
it did, it seemed almost like an answer to her wishes&mdash;as
if she were accountable for it."

"And you accepted her explanation?" said Mr.
Fenton. "It seemed to you plausible?"

"I knew what she meant&mdash;yes. But I could see
that she was over-wrought and excited, or she
wouldn't have thought of it."

"Did she seem distressed over Halleck's death?"

Miss Cornelia hesitated. "N&mdash;not at first," she
said. "She couldn't seem to realize it."

"And afterwards?"&mdash;&mdash;

"Yes, she seemed distressed then. I thought,"
362
said Miss Cornelia firmly "that she felt very badly
indeed when she realized it."

"And there was nothing in her manner that could
induce you to believe that she expected it, or knew
a thing about it beyond what she read in the
papers?"

"Nothing."

With this word, firmly pronounced, Miss Cornelia's
ordeal came to an end; she descended white
and dazed. Elizabeth leaned over as she returned
to her place and pressed her hand with a faint little
smile. "It's all right, auntie, I'm glad you spoke
the truth." And so the episode passed.

"She really has done no more harm than we expected,"
Bobby Van Antwerp observed to his wife.
"It is one of those things which sound much worse
than they really are. After all, what does it amount
to? The hysterical assertion of an excited girl! A
guilty woman is more careful what she says."

"I will tell Elizabeth," said his wife, in relief,
"what you say." But though she found an opportunity
after the day's session, to whisper this encouragement
into the girl's ear, Elizabeth listened
vacantly and did not seem fully to grasp it. The
maid's evidence, her aunt's corroboration, had
brought up vividly to her mind the danger that existed
all the time behind these slow, technical deliberations.
That night the horrible waking dream,
from which for awhile she had been free, returned
more startlingly real than ever, and the face of the
Judge who sentenced her was the same face in
363
which, during the long days in the court-room, she
had thought she detected some involuntary gleams
of sympathy. It had seemed a kind face in the day-time,
but in her dream it was inexorably stern.

The next morning, at the trial, her mind did not
wander; she kept it resolutely fixed on the evidence.
Mr. D'Hauteville was on the stand, and she
wondered what more fatal revelations were to be
made of her words and actions on that unfortunate
morning, when she hardly knew what she said or
did. But no new developments were brought out.
There was no trace in Mr. D'Hauteville's evidence
or his easy, unembarrassed manner of the suspicions
which he had been perhaps the first person in town
to entertain.

Yes, he had seen Miss Van Vorst on the morning
after the murder, and had himself taken her into the
studio. Was there anything peculiar in her manner?
Certainly; she seemed much distressed, as was
natural, he thought, under the circumstances. Had
she tried to possess herself of the fatal flask, or of
any other incriminating objects, as for instance her
own letters? No, most emphatically no. Was it
true, as the elevator man had already stated, that
she had defended herself against his accusations?
He could not remember anything of the kind; certainly
he had not accused her, as he had no reason
to suspect her.

Mr. Fenton on cross-examination, drew from him
a description of her tears, of the fearless way in
which she had entered, her apparent indifference to
364
being observed. Was it, Mr. Fenton demanded, the
manner of a guilty woman? The witness fully
agreed that it was not. And then he left the stand,
saying to himself philosophically that all was fair in
the cause of a beautiful and unfortunate girl, whom
he had admired extremely, and with whom his friend
Gerard had been, and might be still, desperately in
love.

The next witness was the Brooklyn tradesman,
whose evidence had been already so much exploited
by the yellow journals that it lacked the force of
novelty. He deposed to having sold the flask on
the morning of the twenty-third of December, to a
woman in black, thickly veiled, slight and tall, and
with reddish hair. The witness was quite sure about
the date, and as to the time he was less explicit, but
convinced that it was somewhere between the hours
of ten and twelve. He was a middle-aged man
with a plain, honest face, and evidently anxious to
tell what he knew and no more. When the District
Attorney, in a dramatic manner, desired him to look
at the defendant, and declare if she were the woman
to whom he sold the flask, he seemed to shrink in
distress from the terrible responsibility thus placed
upon him.

"I&mdash;it is so long ago," he protested, "and&mdash;you&mdash;must
remember that she wore a veil."

"Which entirely obscured her face?"&mdash;&mdash;

"No, not entirely," the witness reluctantly admitted.

"Look at the defendant," the District Attorney
insisted, "and tell the court if her general appearance
365
recalls that of the woman to whom you sold the
flask."

He turned to Elizabeth and requested her to rise.
She grew a shade paler and stared at him for a moment
as if startled; then slowly, she obeyed him,
and stood facing the witness, who brought reluctantly
his anxious gaze to bear upon her. She was
ashy-white, but she held her head erect, her eyes
met his without flinching. Thus they stood for fully
a minute, and the silence in the court-room was
tense with nervous excitement. Then the witness
spoke.

"I&mdash;there is a certain resemblance," he said.

"Then you identify her?" said the District Attorney.

The witness was silent. He looked again at
Elizabeth. She was trembling now, and caught
hold of a chair as if for support. The witness
cleared his throat. He was thinking that he had a
daughter of about Elizabeth's age.

"I&mdash;I really could not tell," he began.

"Take your time," said the District Attorney, impressively.
"This is a very important point."

And then there was again a long silence. In the
midst of it the sun, bursting through a gray mass of
clouds, touched Elizabeth's hair with a wave of light.
It stood out, a shining halo, against the rim of her
black hat. The witness stared at it as if fascinated.
Then he uttered a sound&mdash;it might almost have been
a sob&mdash;of relief.

"That is not the same woman," he said. "The
hair is quite different! That other woman's hair
366
was a much deeper red&mdash;it didn't shine and glisten.
And her whole air, the way she held herself was different.
I am sure it is not the same."

And this opinion, once announced, he clung to
tenaciously&mdash;nothing the District Attorney said
could shake it. Mr. Fenton would not even cross-examine,
and there was great rejoicing in the ranks
of the defense.

But the next day the prosecution placed upon the
stand a druggist's clerk, who remembered having
sold a bottle of arsenic to a woman dressed in black
on the morning of the twenty-third of December.
The occurrence was impressed on his mind because
he had demurred as to selling poison, and she had
presented a physician's certificate. She was handsomely
dressed and seemed like a lady; he had
noticed particularly that her hair was reddish. And
when asked to identify Elizabeth, he swore unhesitatingly
that she was the same woman.

Upon Mr. Fenton's cross-examination, it became
evident what important questions may hang on the
color of a woman's hair.

Mr. Fenton: "You said, did you not, that the
woman's hair was red?"

Witness, cautiously: "I said, reddish. That's
not quite the same thing."

Mr. Fenton: "Explain the difference."

Witness, confused: "Well, I&mdash;I don't know. I
meant to say it was sort of&mdash;sort of light"&mdash;&mdash;

"You meant to say, in other words, that it was
not black?"
367

Witness, recovering himself and speaking stubbornly:
"No, I meant to say that it was reddish&mdash;sort
of sandy"&mdash;&mdash;

"Ah&mdash;like the District Attorney's moustache,
for instance?"

There was laughter in the court-room. The District
Attorney's moustache was a brilliant carrot
color, which at the opposing counsel's words, was
emulated by his face.

"I object to these personalities," he said.

Mr. Fenton was instructed by the Judge to be
more serious, but held to his point.

"Your Honor, it is necessary to find out what the
witness means by the vague word 'reddish.' If
he thinks it applies to the District Attorney's moustache"&mdash;&mdash;

"But I don't," objected the aggrieved witness, to
the renewed amusement of the court-room. "I call
that carroty."

"Then point out, among people present, what
hair you consider reddish."

The witness's eyes wandered till they alighted
upon the distinctly sandy locks of one of the experts
for the prosecution. "I call that hair reddish,"
he announced, with some satisfaction at finding a
way out of his dilemma.

"Ah&mdash;now oblige me, by looking at the defendant's
hair and tell us if you think it is like that of
this gentleman."

The witness glanced helplessly at Elizabeth. "It&mdash;isn't
much like it," he admitted.
368

"And yet you describe both as 'reddish?'"

The witness was desperate. "Well, I&mdash;I don't
exactly know"&mdash;he said.

"What you mean by 'reddish?'" said Mr.
Fenton.

"Well&mdash;no," said the witness.

"I see that you don't. It's not necessary for you
to tell us that. You are color blind evidently, and
by 'reddish' you simply mean anything between
black and tow-color. But you can't swear away a
woman's life with such vague descriptions as this.
You can go now. I have no more questions to ask."

The crestfallen witness gladly retreated. But in
spite of his discomfiture, his evidence had been a
serious blow to the defense, and when, a few days
later, the prosecution closed its case, it was admitted
on every side to be a strong one.

The defense opened quietly enough. Mr. Fenton,
too, brought out his handwriting experts, who
were prepared with an equally startling array of
technical details, to swear to the exact opposite of
what had been solemnly declared by the experts for
the prosecution. The court settled down into a
dreamy mood, and the spectators for the most part
went to sleep.

There was a break in the monotony, and one
which created much excitement, when Elizabeth
took the stand on her own behalf. She had been
very anxious to do this, and Mr. Fenton had reluctantly
consented, with many misgivings and elaborate
instructions, to which he saw, to his alarm,
that she listened almost vacantly. But when she
369
began to testify his doubts disappeared. She gave
her evidence very simply and directly, and there was
something in the soft, low tones of her voice, an indefinable
ring of girlishness, of youth and inexperience,
which carried with it an illogical thrill of
conviction.

She had never, she said, bought the flask which
contained the poison, nor had she ever seen one
exactly like it. She had not gone to Brooklyn on
the twenty-third of December&mdash;she had never gone
there in her life. She had spent the morning of the
twenty-third of December at the Metropolitan
Museum. She had not bought the bottle of arsenic,
and knew nothing of it. She had no reason to expect
Paul Halleck's death. She had read of it in the
papers. No, she had not meant the assertion literally
when she said that she had killed him; she had
been startled because his death had seemed to come
in direct answer to her wishes, and she had somehow
felt accountable for it. Yes, it was a morbid
idea&mdash;she realized it now, but she had not been at
all well at the time. That was the reason she had
gone up to the studio; she had been in a state of
nervous excitement and hardly knew what she did.
No, she had not thought of the police suspecting her
in consequence; such an idea had never entered her
mind.

On the whole, Mr. Fenton was satisfied with the
effect that she was producing. He had made the
agreeable discovery that he was beginning to believe
in her himself; and if this conviction was impressing
itself more and more upon his own suspicious
370
mind, it must, he thought, be all-powerful
with the jury, whom he had already mentally appraised
as kindly men, anxious to escape from an
unpleasant duty, and willing to give the prisoner
the full benefit of every doubt.

But when Mr. Fenton at last sat down and the
District Attorney took his place, then, indeed, began
a very bad quarter of an hour for Elizabeth. Question
by question, the lawyer drew out of her her
reasons for keeping her marriage secret and for
wishing Halleck dead, her engagement to Gerard
and the manner in which she had deceived him.
Her color changed from white to red and back
again to ghastly pallor, her voice faltered and
broke piteously, but still the terrible inquiry proceeded.
Behind her, her aunts were biting their
lips in agony and Mrs. Bobby was beside herself with
indignation. "I'd give anything in the world," she
said to her husband, "to get even with that man."
Elizabeth's counsel was keeping up a running fire
of objections, but in vain. The District Attorney
got in his questions somehow or another, and Elizabeth
answered them as best she could.

"Why," she was asked among other things,
"was your engagement to Mr. Gerard broken off?"

"Because," she faltered, "I&mdash;I told him of my
marriage."

"Why did you suddenly tell him, when you had
kept it concealed so long?"

Elizabeth looked up with a piteous appeal in her
eyes, which was answered by an objection on the
part of her counsel, and she was told by the Judge
371
that she need answer no question unless she wished.
But by this time she had recovered herself.

"I am quite willing to answer," she said. "I
told him because I was sorry I had deceived him.
I had no other reason."

"You are quite sure that you did tell him, and
that he did not&mdash;find out for himself?"

There was an insulting tone to the question, but
she answered it steadily, without anger. "I am
quite sure," she said.

"Who was with you on the day that you say you
went to the Metropolitan Museum?" This was the
next question, put with disconcerting suddenness.

She turned still whiter, if that were possible, than
before, and her answer was barely audible. "Mr.
Gerard."

"Was any one else with you?"

"No one."

"Is he the only person who can corroborate your
statement?"

"Yes."

"Then it is a pity he is not here."

She was silent.

"Mr. Gerard," observed Mr. Fenton, "when he
went abroad left no address. We made efforts to
communicate with him, but so far, we have not
succeeded. It is most unfortunate."

"Most unfortunate, certainly," echoed the District
Attorney, "for the defendant. But perhaps
he was not anxious to be summoned. We have
heard of witnesses who went to the ends of the
earth to avoid it."
372

He turned to Elizabeth. "Do you know of any
reason," he asked, "why he should not wish to
come?"

Elizabeth's hands were clasped together nervously.
"I&mdash;I cannot tell."

"Did you send for him, as soon as you knew that
his testimony was needed?"

"I did not."

"Why did you not?" said the District Attorney,
in his sneering voice.

The color flushed into her face. "Because I&mdash;because
I"&mdash;Her voice faltered and broke. "I did
not wish him sent for," she said, with a sudden flash
of defiance. Then she turned deathly white, and put
up her handkerchief to her lips. "I&mdash;will not answer
any more questions," she added, faintly.

After all, it had been very bad&mdash;worse, far worse,
than she had expected. She felt as she left the
stand that she had done her cause only harm. It
seemed to her moreover, that whether she were acquitted
or found guilty, she could never, after the
abasement of that cross-examination, hold up her
head again.

The outlook was gloomy, and the case for the
defence was almost closed. But when Mrs. Bobby
arrived in court the next morning, she was greeted
by Mr. Fenton with a broad smile.

"We must put the handwriting experts on again,"
he said, cheerfully. "It will be dull, but anything
to gain time. I have had a cable from Mr. Gerard.
He will be here in a few days."


373

Chapter XXXVII


Julian Gerard paced impatiently the
deck of the steamer on which, for eight
miserable days, he had existed without
sight of a newspaper. It was early dawn;
the outlines of the Goddess of Liberty loomed uncertainly
through a thick fog. He remembered
how, when he had last seen his native shores, he
had been distraught with bitter anger against the
woman to whom his heart now turned with an
eager longing, a passionate remorse.

For the hundredth time his mind analyzed and
condemned that strange whim, the expression of a
passing but very real phase of his disappointment
and disillusion, which had led him to cut himself
off from the world he had left behind. He had
no wish to hear from home, to be reminded of home
ties, or of the woman whom he had resolved to
forget. Beneath his self-repressed exterior there
was a strain of adventure in his blood, which made
him turn, in a crisis like this, to the primitive resources
of uncivilized life.

He had left home with no definite plans; but in
London he met a friend, who was about to start for
his farm in South Africa. Gerard at once decided
to accompany him. South Africa was as good a
374
place as any other, when all one desired was solitude
and hardship, and to get away from one's self, and
the unsatisfactory tone of the world.

The farm was deep in the interior of the country,
many miles distant from railroad or telegraph station.
For months the two men saw no one but the
natives; they had no connection with the outside
world. Gerard rode and hunted and studied, and
took notes on the condition of the country. It was
not a bad life on the whole, with a certain charm
for a man satiated with all that wealth can give.
He might even have enjoyed it, if he could have forgotten
what had driven him to it, or erased from
his memory the one face which haunted him.

The worst of it was, that she always seemed to
be unhappy; he always saw her as he had left her,
white and sad, with pathetic eyes. The thought of
her which he had carried away that night seemed
to have entirely effaced his earlier impressions of
her, as she had first flashed upon him in the vivid
radiance of her fresh beauty, as he had seen her
often in a ball-room, a being meant only for smiles.
He had never pictured her then as suffering; but
now, he could not think of her in any other way.

One evening, as he and his friend sat together
smoking, he found himself impelled, as it were, in
spite of himself, to tell his story. The doubts, the
misgivings which tortured him had grown too
strong; it was a relief to put them into words. He
spoke low and bitterly, in hurried phrases that were
evidently the expression of his constant thoughts;
not excusing the conduct of the woman who had
375
deceived him, dwelling upon it rather with some
harshness, for the very wish perhaps which he was
conscious of to do the reverse. The other man, as
he spoke, scanned his face keenly. At the end he
made only one comment. "And yet she loved
you?"

Gerard stared at him for a moment, the color
flushing into his dark cheek. And then his face
softened. Yes, it was not his money and position&mdash;he
could at least do her that justice. "I believe she
did," he said at last in a low voice.

"Then, for Heaven's sake," the other man flashed
out, "what more do you want? Why, good Lord,
if a woman loved me!"&mdash;and here he broke off
and sat in silence, staring fixedly into the fire.

Gerard paced the floor that night, and his friend
in the next room smiled grimly to hear him. The
same smile flickered across his impassive features
when Gerard, the next morning, announced his departure.
His reasons were plausible; he wished to
go about the country and study for himself the political
situation of which he had hitherto seen little
or nothing. His host, after that first involuntary
smile, heard him through unmoved and expressed
his approval. He escorted him to the nearest town,
wrung his hand at parting, and went back, with a
grimmer look than ever, to his own solitude.

Gerard had no plans; he was conscious of only
one wish&mdash;to be where he could have news of home.
At Cape Town he met the detective, who had followed
him, led astray by various false clues, till he
had at last found the right track. An hour later the
376
two men started for New York. And now at last
the wretched journey was over, and Gerard paced
the deck of the ship and wondered miserably what
new developments might have occurred.

There was a sensation in the court-room when
he appeared. There had been rumors for days that
the trial was being delayed for the arrival of an
important witness, but it had hardly been expected
that this would prove to be Elizabeth's missing
lover, who had disappeared from view, as the prosecution
had asserted, to avoid testifying against her.
At least that reason for his absence could not be
true, since it was Mr. Fenton who was bringing
him in, with an evident air of triumph. Gerard himself
had a worn and haggard look, which showed
even through the sun-burn which had darkened his
face. He had grown very thin, and there were
white threads in his hair which were not visible a
year before; his features were set in lines of absolute,
impassive rigidity. He glanced neither to the
right nor left, but sat down at once in the ranks
of witnesses.

There was a short pause of breathless expectancy,
and then the prisoner was brought in. Her aunts
and Mrs. Van Antwerp were with her as usual, and
behind followed the police officer&mdash;a little in the
background, and with the air he considerately wore
of effacing himself as much as possible. Those who
were near Gerard saw him wince and flush painfully.
He had been prepared for this, but the reality
shocked him, almost beyond his powers of self-control.
How changed she was! Paler even than he
377
remembered her, and thin and worn till, but for her
eyes and hair, he might scarcely have known her.
It gave him a shock, too, somehow to see her all in
black; he had always pictured her, illogically, in white
as she had been that last evening.... For a
moment she hardly seemed the same woman he had
thought of, dreamed of, all these months. A rush
of remorseful tenderness swept over him, all the
greater because she was so changed. He would
have liked to go to her before them all, and proclaim
to the whole world his love and faith. But
what he actually did was to turn his eyes away,
to spare her.

She knew that he was there. She had read the
news in the trembling joy depicted on her aunts'
faces, before Eleanor Van Antwerp had whispered:
"Darling, prepare yourself! He has come&mdash;he has
come to save you." It hardly seemed a surprise,
now that it had happened; she had always known
in her heart that he would come. But she was not
glad, she did not wish to be saved&mdash;by him. She still
felt as she had felt from the first, that she would
rather die than sit in her place of humiliation and see
the pity in his eyes.... Ah, thank Heaven,
he had turned them away; for him, no doubt, as
for her it was a painful moment. He felt sorry
for her, of course&mdash;a woman whom he had loved
once, who was being punished more than she deserved.
But there was an invincible pride in her
nature which rebelled against his pity, which would
have preferred condemnation, contempt. Yet, after
all, pity was all that she deserved; she had never
378
been worthy of his love. Let her take what poor
remnant of it was left and be thankful. Yet deep
down in her heart, there was, in spite of herself, a
feeling of joy that the world would know that he
had not forsaken her.

There was little time for these conflicting thoughts
to oppose each other in Elizabeth's weary brain.
Gerard was called to the stand, and then she could
do nothing but listen&mdash;and listen gratefully&mdash;while
in quiet, even tones, speaking very simply and to
the point, he corroborated all that she herself had
testified. Yes, he remembered perfectly the morning
of the twenty-third of December. He had spent
it with Miss Van Vorst at the Metropolitan
Museum. They had been at the Museum for several
hours, and he had left her at her home at half-past
one. Had he known then of her marriage to
Halleck? No, not then, but soon afterwards. She
had told him on New Year's Eve. No, he had not
suspected it, or drawn out the avowal in any way.
It had been entirely voluntary. Naturally their engagement
had been at an end, and he had gone
abroad immediately. That was his evidence. It
materially strengthened the defence on two points;
first, that the prisoner had not bought either the
flask or the poison; second, that she had not expected
Paul Halleck's death.

The District Attorney, realizing this, tried to
undermine its credibility. It was not an easy thing
with a man of Gerard's character and high standing;
but after all, a man in love is hardly an accountable
being. The District Attorney dwelt sarcastically
379
on the improbability of his having remained
in ignorance all this time of the impending
trial, and insinuated that he must have had serious
objections to returning, which had been finally overcome
by the efforts of the defense. He asked his
questions in a blustering way, which fell just short
of insolence. Gerard answered them quietly, apparently
unmoved. Yes, he admitted, it seemed improbable
that he should not have heard of the trial,
but it was nevertheless absolutely true. He had
spent the greater part of his absence on a farm in
South Africa; he had led a rough, solitary life,
read no newspapers, received no letters. He had
first heard that his evidence was needed at Cape
town, five weeks before. No, he had not received
a letter from the defendant, urging him to come to
her rescue, nor did he believe that any such letter
had been sent. It would have been quite unnecessary.

"Your disinterested chivalry, in other words,"
sneered the District Attorney, "was sufficient, without
such an appeal?"

"It is not a question of chivalry," said Gerard,
coolly, "it is a question of telling the truth."

"Which of course you are anxious to do."

"Of course."

His imperturbability seemed proof, against all the
offensiveness of the other's manner. The District
Attorney, shifting his ground, questioned him as to
the broken engagement; and here he was rejoiced
to find his man more vulnerable. A tremor would
cross Gerard's face, he changed color more than
380
once. But still his answers were given quietly, in
low, measured tones. Yes, it was true that Miss
Van Vorst had kept him in ignorance of her marriage;
but he did not think that her reasons for her
silence need be discussed, since they were quite
irrelevant.

"And you mean to assure us," said the District
Attorney, incredulously, "that she told you at last
of her own accord, without the slightest necessity?"

"Most certainly."

"And what she told you then was the only information
you received of her marriage?"

"Yes."

"It was the only reason for breaking the engagement?"

"Yes."

"And now that that reason no longer exists," said
the District Attorney, "the engagement, I suppose,
is likely to be renewed?"

The question was so unexpected that Mr. Fenton
was not ready with an objection, and Gerard spoke
before he could interpose.

"I don't think that I am bound to answer questions
as to what may or may not occur in the future."

Mr. Fenton hastily agreed with him, and he was
sustained by the judge. But the District Attorney
defended his line of inquiry.

"Your Honor, it is important for me to show
how far this witness is biassed in favor of the defendant.
He has wished to marry her once, it is
possible, apparently, that he may be in the same
381
position again. You won't deny," he went on, turning
to Gerard, "&mdash;that there is such a possibility?"

Gerard hesitated for perhaps a second. Then he
looked the lawyer squarely, defiantly in the face.
He was very pale, but there was an angry light in
his eyes; his voice rang out clearly. "I deny nothing,"
he said, "except that my feelings toward Miss
Van Vorst have influenced the truth of anything I
said."

Mr. Fenton again formally entered his objection,
and after some wrangling, question and answer
were stricken from the record. Still, the jury had
heard them and could form their own conclusions.
Mr. Fenton was not dissatisfied; there was a romantic
element in the situation which must, he
thought, appeal irresistibly to the popular imagination.
And indeed, as Gerard left the stand, the general
sympathy was on his side, even among those
who secretly thought that he had stretched a point
here and there, on behalf of the woman he loved.
It was possible that his evidence was false; but the
people who thought thus, if they were men, did
not blame him; if they were women, they admired
him rather the more.

The eyes of the court-room were fixed upon him
as he crossed over to where Elizabeth sat and shook
hands with her quietly, as if they had parted yesterday.
And then he seated himself near her, in the
little circle of her supporters. Eleanor Van Antwerp
put out her hand to him, her dark eyes shining
through a mist of tears.
382

"Julian, you don't know how happy I am to have
you back."

He shuddered, "Don't speak of it, Eleanor. I
can never forgive myself for having gone."

Elizabeth heard the words, but her eyes were
resolutely bent on the ground, and she refused to
take any of the comfort that his presence might have
imparted. It was natural that he should feel remorseful,
eager to show to the world as much as
possible that he had not forsaken her, that he
thoroughly believed in her innocence. But for anything
more, such a possibility as the District Attorney
had suggested, which he did not deny, could not,
of course, very well deny under the circumstances?...
Ah, no, there could be no question any
more of love between them. Her own pride would
not permit it, even if what she called his pity could
influence his judgment to that extent. And then,
with a start, she remembered that she was still on
trial for her life, and that all thoughts of love and
marriage were incongruous, almost grotesque. The
case for the defense was closed, the District Attorney
was to make his final address the next day. The
thing would soon be decided, one way or the other.

The next morning, a box of flowers was brought
to her; the white roses which he had always sent
her. For a moment she hesitated, touched them
lovingly, and then at last she took one of them and
fastened it in her belt. "It may bring luck," she
murmured, as if to excuse her action, and then she
bent her head, and pressed her lips to its fragrant
petals.
383

A little later, when she entered the court-room,
the eyes of all were fixed on the flower. It was
the first touch of color that had ever relieved her
black gown.

"You see," one woman whispered, "it's the sign
of innocence."

Her companion, less easily moved, replied cautiously:
"Perhaps."


384

Chapter XXXVIII


The tide of popular sentiment was turning
in Elizabeth's favor. It had not been with
her at first, in spite of her youth and the
pathetic circumstances of her position; nay, against
her all the more on that very account with many
people, who feared a display of mawkish sentiment,
and to whom the cold-blooded character of the crime
stood out the more harshly, by contrast with her soft
and girlish looks. But now one thing and another&mdash;an
intangible something in her manner on the
witness-stand; Gerard's return and his evidence on
her behalf; his apparently unchanged devotion&mdash;all
this had created a strong revulsion of feeling, which
was increased rather than diminished by the District
Attorney's charge.

The District Attorney was in a brutal mood. He
did not spare Elizabeth, he left it, he said, to the
jury to determine the weight of Gerard's evidence.
For himself, he would not for the world suggest
that a gentleman of Mr. Gerard's high character
would testify falsely; yet he might be&mdash;mistaken;
he might easily make some slight error in dates,
misled by his&mdash;his interest in the defendant. While
he talked Gerard bit his lip, inwardly cursing that
dictate of civilization which had abolished duelling,
385
and made even horsewhipping a doubtful expedient.
Mrs. Bobby was considering ways by which one
could be avenged on "a horrible man, not in society,
whom one couldn't snub by not asking him
to dinner, or anything of that kind." Elizabeth felt,
with a new thrill of pain, that she was involving
Gerard in her own disgrace. But Mr. Fenton surveyed
the District Attorney unmoved through half-closed
eyes, and said to himself coolly that he was
going too far.

His own charge was a skillful defense of Gerard's
evidence, a criticism, not too violent, of the District
Attorney's brutality, and an appeal, not too open,
to the sympathies of the jury. Elizabeth flushed as
she realized that this was the point, after all; she
was to be saved on issues that would not have been
effectual with a man. And then the Judge's charge
began, and she forgot all sense of humiliation, forgot
everything but the thought that her fate hung
in the balance, to be decided one way or the other
by those carefully-balanced, judicial phrases. Did
she imagine it, or was there, through all the calm
analysis of evidence, the impartial weighing of this
or that detail, a conviction of her innocence so decided
that it made itself felt almost unconsciously?

"Strong on our side!" Bobby Van Antwerp's
voice, unusually animated and exultant, sounded in
his wife's ear at the end. "The prosecution are
furious&mdash;they say it's horribly unfair. But of
course, we won't quarrel with that."

Eleanor was deathly white; her hands were
tightly locked together. At Bobby's words she gave
386
a little sob of hysterical relief. "Oh, Bobby," she
murmured, under her breath, "thank God that
judges are human, after all! Now, if the jury are
anything short of brutes, they'll acquit her at once
and make an end of this."

But the jury fell short of this test of humanity,
and retired to deliberate. Mrs. Bobby scanned their
faces anxiously, as she had done at the beginning
of the trial. They were care-worn and gloomy&mdash;naturally,
with a woman's life in their hands; but
surely&mdash;surely they should look happier, since it was
in their power to save her?

"I wish, Bobby," she murmured, with that sob
again in her throat, but this time not one of relief,
"I wish we had tried if they wouldn't take money!"

"Don't, Eleanor," said Bobby. "They're all
honest men&mdash;and besides, one can't do such things!"
To himself he was thinking that women really
seemed on such occasions as this to be entirely without
principle, and yet that somehow one liked them
all the better for it.

This was at two o'clock. Three, four, five o'clock
came, and still they made no sign. The long deliberation
seemed ominous to the anxious group who
waited in a small, dark room on the ground floor of
the court-house, starting at every sound and counting
the moments as they dragged wearily along.
Mr. Fenton and the other counsel came restlessly in
and out, with a cheerful air that covered but indifferently
their intense anxiety; Bobby and Julian
Gerard stood by the window, talking occasionally in
low tones, more often silent and gazing at the prison
387
walls that rose up grimly before their eyes. Elizabeth
sat at a small table in the middle of the room,
and her aunts and Mrs. Van Antwerp sat around
her in a forlorn circle. It was a long while since
any one had spoken; all consoling suggestions were
exhausted.

Elizabeth's hands were clasped tightly in her lap,
her eyes, wide-open yet unseeing, stared steadily
before her. Vaguely she was conscious that there
were people in the room, that by the window stood
the man whose presence might have mattered more
to her at some other time than anything else on
earth; that her aunts and Eleanor Van Antwerp
were beside her, and would bend forward now and
then, one or other of them, to press her hand. In
a dull, mechanical way, she was thankful to know
that they were there; yet nothing they said or did
could help her, a great gulf seemed to yawn between
her and the outside world.... It is thus,
perhaps, that the dying feel when they see, with their
failing sight, the faces of friends, and know that
even love is powerless to reach them. Elizabeth
suffered, during those hours of suspense, the agony
of death a hundred times over. But as the afternoon
wore on, hope faded and the numbness of
despair crept over her tortured nerves.

"I don't like their staying out so long," Bobby
Van Antwerp could not help murmuring to Gerard.
"After the charge, I thought they'd let her off at
once. They all want to&mdash;that's certain. But there
were one or two of them who looked&mdash;infernally
conscientious."
388

"I don't want any of them"&mdash;Gerard began, but
stopped. "To go against his convictions," was what
he had meant to add, but the words remained unspoken.
There are limits to even a Puritan conscience.
"Good God! Bobby," he whispered,
hoarsely, "a man who could convict her deserves
to be shot!"

"I agree with you, old man," said Bobby, tranquilly.
And then they once more fell silent, and
the shadows lengthened, and some one lit a feeble
gas-jet, which brought out, in ghastly relief, the look
of strained expectancy on each face.

At six o'clock there was a rustle, an excitement.
Mr. Fenton came in and spoke to Bobby, and he
spoke to his wife. She touched Elizabeth on the
shoulder. "Dear, we&mdash;we go up now," she said.
Elizabeth rose and mechanically put up her hand to
her hair.

"Do I look all right?" she said, and then smiled
vaguely at the commonplace question. A merciful
stupor had descended upon her in the last hour;
when she looked at her aunts, she saw that they
were suffering far more than she. "I am not
frightened," she said, "please don't be frightened."
She was determined that she would be brave. This
was the thought uppermost in her mind.

They went up to the court-room, and on the
threshold Mr. Fenton said to her: "Remember,
that even if the verdict is&mdash;is unfavorable, it is not
final. We shall appeal." She bent her head, wondering
mechanically that any one should speak of things
to happen after the verdict. Her whole life seemed
389
bounded by the events of the next few minutes; she
could not look beyond.... The thought crossed
her mind of how slight a thing would decide her fate&mdash;the
difference between one word or two, guilty or
not guilty. A mere trifle&mdash;a word in three letters;
yet all the difference between honor and dishonor,
life and death. Her mind fastened upon the irrelevant
detail and dallied with it; the while she was
conscious, with sickening intensity, of each movement
in the court-room&mdash;the breathless atmosphere
of a suspense, in which the mere rustling of a paper
jarred upon the nerves; the jury filing in, the formal
opening question, "Gentlemen of the jury, have
you decided upon your verdict?" Her throat was
parched, balls of fire danced before her eyes, there
was a sound in her ears like the rushing of many
waters. Guilty or not guilty? One word or two?
The question beat upon her brain with a dull persistence,
and she was conscious, vaguely, that the
answer was of vital importance, but somehow she
could not bring herself to realize it.

"Not Guilty."

The words rang clear and confident, across that
gulf which separated her from the outside world.
As through a mist she saw the relief on the faces
of those around her, but still she herself was conscious
of no feeling. She still sat white and dazed,
staring before her, while her lips moved mechanically,
repeating the words that seemed so meaningless:
"Not Guilty."

There was a pause, and then a stir, a murmur of
relief. Some women sobbed aloud. But she herself
390
still sat staring before her, repeating the answer
that seemed to have no meaning: "Not Guilty."


391

Chapter XXXIX


By the next morning, she had realized all that
the verdict meant; she had had time even
to grow used to it. The first joy had spent
itself, the inevitable reaction was setting in.

"Life isn't everything," she thought, and stared
before her with knit brows. The fire&mdash;it was a
long time since she had sat beside one&mdash;gave out a
cheerful glow, the little drawing-room wore a festive
air and was bright with flowers that had been
sent to her. A feeling of physical ease and contentment,
of relief in the mere change of scene, stole
over her wearied senses. But still it did not suffice;
she struggled indeed against it.

She took up and re-read a letter which had been
left for her a little while before, and had caused
her, in her state of exhaustion, something of a
nervous shock.


"They have just told me," it said, "that you are
acquitted. As for me, I am very ill. They say I
can't live much longer. That's why I ask if you
will come and see me at once. There are some
things I'd like to tell you, and if you don't come
quickly it may be too late."

AMANDA."


392

The address was that of a hospital.

"I didn't know," Elizabeth said, "that Amanda
was so ill."

Her aunts, who were hovering about the room,
devouring their recovered treasure with tender
eyes, looked surprised at her introduction of an
irrelevant subject.

"I heard that she had gone to a hospital," Miss
Cornelia said, dryly, "and her mother came down
to be near her&mdash;but dear me, that girl always has
something the matter with her! I don't know why
you should trouble yourself about her, my dear.
Both she and her mother have behaved in a very
unfeeling way all this time, never coming to see
you, or sending messages, or anything."

"Well, Amanda has sent me a message now,"
said Elizabeth. "She wants me to come and see
her, and I think"&mdash;she hesitated a moment&mdash;"I
think I shall go at once," she announced with sudden
decision. The words sounded strangely to her as
she uttered them. It was so long since she had said
that she would do this or that. And even now, her
wishes met with some faint opposition.

Her aunts looked at each other. "But won't that
be painful for you, my dear?" urged Miss Cornelia,
after a moment.

"I'm used to painful things, Aunt Cornelia." The
girl's smile was bitter; there was a tone of petulant
wilfulness in her voice. Her aunts still looked at
one another unspoken words trembled on the lips
of each.
393

"My dear," Miss Joanna began at last, "Julian"&mdash;she
stopped.

"He said he hoped to see you this morning,"
said Miss Cornelia, taking up the sentence. "He
hoped that after you had rested"&mdash;she faltered as
a look crossed Elizabeth's face, which did not promise
consent. And then suddenly she took courage
and crossed over to Elizabeth and took her hand.
"My dear," she cried, "you&mdash;you must see him.
He has been so unhappy. He&mdash;he loves you, Elizabeth."
Again her voice faltered. The girl sat passive
for a moment, and then she flushed and dragged
away her hand.

"I can't see him," she broke out, hoarsely; "it&mdash;it
would be more painful than seeing Amanda.
And&mdash;if he loves me, why, so much the worse!"
Then softening, as she met their dismayed looks:
"Oh, don't you understand," she cried, "don't you
understand that the kindest thing I can do for him
is&mdash;not to see him?" And then the tears sprang
to her eyes and she hurriedly left the room.

When she came back a few minutes later, she was
dressed for going out, in the black gown and hat
that she had worn at the trial. She had tied a
black veil over her face.

"I must go to see Amanda," she said, speaking
very quietly and without any trace of emotion. "I
should always regret it if&mdash;if anything happened
before I went." She paused as if in expectation of
further protest, and then as none came, she went to
them and kissed them both affectionately. "You&mdash;you
394
don't mind, do you," she said, with a note
of apology in her voice. Her aunts sighed
resignedly.

"I wish you would let me go with you, Elizabeth,"
Miss Cornelia said, feebly.

Elizabeth smiled. "Why should you, dear?"
she said, quietly. "I've got to face the world alone
some time, I suppose. And it will be nice to see
what it's like&mdash;I've almost forgotten." She gave a
little sigh, but checked it instantly, and went out
before they could say any more.

Once in the street the world seemed so strange
that it was startling, and for a moment turned her
faint and giddy. It was a mild midwinter day&mdash;the
trial had lasted over Christmas and into the new year&mdash;almost
there seemed a foretaste of spring in the
air. To Elizabeth the sunlight was dazzling; she
put up her hand to ward it off. She walked slowly
and feebly, as if she were convalescing from a long
illness. She had not realized before how weak she
was. Fortunately there was but a short walk before
her, through the quiet regions of Irving Place,
past Gramercy Park, and on to the hospital. She
met no one she knew, but several strangers glanced
at her curiously, or so she imagined, as if they
recognized her, even through her veil. They might
know her from the pictures with which the papers
had been filled; they had seen one, no doubt, only
that morning, with an account of the verdict. They
were wondering still, perhaps, if she were guilty
or innocent.

She was very tired when she reached the hospital,
395
and the meeting with Amanda loomed up before
her like a nightmare. Her hand trembled as she
rang the bell. A woman in a sister's dress opened
the door&mdash;the hospital was under the charge of a
Protestant order. There was something conventual
about the waiting-room, into which she was
shown. There was little furniture, pictures of
saints hung on the walls, the wide window was filled
with stained glass, through which the light streamed
faintly and fell in bars of crimson and purple upon
the polished floor. The sister, speaking in the subdued
voice which the place seemed to demand, bade
Elizabeth seat herself and took up her name.

Elizabeth sank down with a sense of physical relief,
which obliterated all other feelings. A moment
later she looked up with a start. The door opened
and a woman entered. It was Amanda's mother.

"Well Elizabeth, so you've got off!" she said,
mechanically touching with dry lips her niece's
cheek. "I'm sure I'm glad enough, for the sake of
the family. And then I never thought you did it."

Elizabeth flushed painfully. "That was kind of
you, Aunt Rebecca," she said.

"Well, a great many people did, you know, and
probably do still, for that matter. But lor'&mdash;what
difference does it make, as long as you've got off?
Some people might think all the more of you. There
was that girl at&mdash;&mdash;who committed that murder that
everybody talked about&mdash;she got a hundred offers,
they say, right after she was acquitted. And everybody
knew that she got off, just because she was a
woman."
396

Elizabeth shuddered. "Please don't talk about it,
Aunt Rebecca," she said, faintly. "Tell me about
Amanda."

A sort of contraction crossed Aunt Rebecca's face,
which might in any one else, have resulted in tears.
"Oh, Amanda's pretty poorly," she said, in an odd,
dry voice. "I guess all those sanitariums and new-fangled
inventions, haven't done her much good.
Why the doctor sent her here, I don't know. It's
a queer Catholic place, and I don't hold with such
notions, but Amanda seems taken with the sisters"&mdash;she
broke off abruptly as one of their number
entered.

She was a woman of middle age, with a grave,
fine face and musical voice which harmonized with
the place and her own costume. In her presence
Amanda's mother, for all her uneasy contempt
seemed to sink at once into insignificance. The Sister
took possession very gently, but completely, of
Elizabeth. Her charge had been very anxious, she
said, to see her; it was kind of Miss Van Vorst to
come. And then she led the way up the stairs, and
down the long white corridors, talking quietly as
she went of Amanda's case. The girl was suffering
from a complication of maladies, and the Sister
thought that there was, besides, some trouble weighing
on her mind, under the stress of which she grew
daily weaker. No, there was, humanly speaking,
little hope, though Amanda's poor mother did not
realize it, but the Sister thought it would do her
patient good to see Miss Van Vorst, of whom she
had talked a great deal. All this time there was not
397
a word, not a curious glance, to show that the
Sister knew that she had beside her the subject of
so much discussion. And yet Elizabeth felt herself
enveloped in an atmosphere of sympathy, a tacit
recognition of the fact that she had suffered, which
held in it not a trace of blame or suspicion. Elizabeth
felt grateful.

The private room which Amanda occupied as one
of the few "paying patients," was near the roof of
the house, at the head of several flights of stairs.
Sunlight poured in through the window, the floor
was covered with matting, the walls bare and hung
with religious pictures. Opposite the small iron bed,
and placed where the light fell full upon it, was an
engraving, the copy of a famous picture, of Christ
upon the Cross. It was singularly vivid, and the
sorrowful dignity of the face had attracted the eyes
and soothed the sufferings of many an occupant of
the room.

Amanda's strange, light eyes, as they stood out
unnaturally large and dilated in her thin, wasted
face, were not fixed upon the picture; but turned
with eager expectancy towards the door. She was
sitting up in bed, her head propped with pillows.
Her skin had faded to a duller, more ghastly tint
than ever, but a bright spot of red burned in either
cheek. As Elizabeth entered she started, and an
odd look flitted across her face&mdash;it was hard to tell
whether it indicated relief, or fear, or perhaps a
mingling of both.

"So you've come," she said, and drew a long
sobbing breath. It was all her greeting. Elizabeth,
398
embarrassed, murmured a few words of sympathy,
as she sank into the chair nearest the door. The
Sister, with a keen glance from one to the other,
left the two girls alone.

Amanda immediately assumed control of the
situation.

"Sit there," she said, in a quick, sharp voice, and
pointing to a chair by the window, "sit there so I
can look at you." Elizabeth mechanically obeyed
and threw back her veil. Amanda's eyes fastened
eagerly upon her face.

"Why, you&mdash;you've lost your looks," she announced,
abruptly. "Did you know it?" There
was a note of involuntary satisfaction in her voice.

Elizabeth tried to smile. "Worse things have
happened to me than that, Amanda," she said.

"I didn't think anything could be worse&mdash;to
you," Amanda said, feebly.

Elizabeth was silent. She was thinking that suffering
had not yet produced in Amanda any regenerating
effect.

"Well, after all, I guess it don't matter," Amanda
said, drearily, after a pause. "You're acquitted
just the same, and Mr. Gerard is just as crazy about
you as ever, they say. I guess you've got the best
of me still." She sank into a gloomy silence.

Elizabeth dared not speak. She was wondering
if she could not escape, since her cousin had nothing
to say, beyond the old jealous complaint. But
suddenly Amanda turned to her.

"I've something I want to tell you," she said,
399
speaking feebly and with difficulty. "Sister made
me promise that I&mdash;would; she said that if there
was any&mdash;any way in which I'd injured you, it
would ease my mind to&mdash;tell you. But first you
must promise"&mdash;she looked about her suspiciously&mdash;"you
must swear to me on your oath that you
won't repeat&mdash;anything I tell you."

She raised herself up on her pillows, her breath
came in convulsive gasps, she fixed her eyes intently
upon Elizabeth. "Promise," she said, in her
weak, hoarse voice, "swear to me on your oath that
you won't&mdash;repeat what I tell you now."

Elizabeth trembled, her brain felt dazed. Those
strained, eager eyes held her with a terrible insistence.
"I&mdash;I promise," she repeated, hardly knowing
what she said, conscious only of a wish to have
them withdrawn.

Amanda sank back as if relieved, on the pillows,
but still she questioned, with a look of doubt.
"You won't break your word. You are sure?"

"Quite sure," said Elizabeth. Her brain still
seemed dazed, her lips moved mechanically.

Amanda seemed satisfied. Still, she did not speak,
she lay quiet, with half-closed eyes. At last, with
a painful effort, she raised herself up, and fixed her
eyes again intently upon Elizabeth. "I sent the
poison," she said. The words came in a hoarse
whisper.

Elizabeth stared at her without moving; only a
slight shudder passed through her. The words
echoed in her ear, beat upon her brain. The odd
400
part of it was that they did not surprise her. She
seemed somehow to have heard, or thought them,
before.

"Yes," Amanda repeated, after a moment, "I
sent the poison. It was after I had left the sanitarium&mdash;no
one knew that I had left it. I dressed
as like you as I could, I copied your handwriting,
I knew they would think it was you. But I didn't"&mdash;a
slight undertone of contempt made itself felt in
her voice&mdash;"I didn't know how easy it would be,
for I didn't suppose you'd do all those stupid things
that made them suspect you."

She was silent. Elizabeth still stared at her motionless,
aghast. "But why&mdash;why," she faltered,
"what object, Amanda, could you have?"

A look of intense bitterness crossed the sick girl's
face. She seemed to flare up all at once into a
red heat of anger, as dry, withered wood will sometimes
give out the fiercest flames. "What object!"
she repeated. "You ask what object!&mdash;and you
know how he scorned me! Didn't you wish
him to die? You admitted it in court&mdash;because he
stood in your way; and do you think that is anything
to being humiliated&mdash;dragged in the dust, as
I was?"

She leaned back panting on the pillows; the fierce
flame of anger which passed over her seemed to
consume her feeble strength. When she spoke
again it was much more feebly. "That time when
I&mdash;I went to him at the studio," she said, "I thought
maybe he'd come back to me again&mdash;seeing you
didn't seem to want him. I thought&mdash;but there, I
401
was a fool. Most women are, I guess, when they
care about a man. He laughed at me and said that
I'd deceived myself&mdash;that it was I who did the love-making.
That was a lie, but it was what he said,
I guess, about most girls&mdash;when he got tired of
them. I got wild, it seemed as if my brain was on
fire, and I&mdash;I threatened him. He only laughed.
And then I taunted him&mdash;about you; that seemed
to hurt him more. I said as how you had so many
beaux, you didn't care any longer about him. He
said then, I was mistaken, that you were just as
fond of him as ever&mdash;really, that you would do anything
he wanted"&mdash;

She paused, her breath seemed to fail her. Elizabeth
sat listening, stupefied, incapable of speech or
motion. Amanda went on presently, huddling one
word upon another: "I didn't believe him, I
thought it was only to make me feel worse. And
then, when I went out, I met you&mdash;the thought
came to me that I'd find out the truth. I came
back, I'd left the door open, I saw you give him
money&mdash;but there was a look on your face that
made me think you didn't do it&mdash;for love."

She paused again and struggled for breath.
Elizabeth spoke involuntarily. "But how did you
know," she asked, "about the pearls?"

"What, that you'd sold them?" Amanda spoke
quietly, with a slight smile, as at the simplicity of
the question. "I knew it the moment I saw you&mdash;that
evening, and you didn't have them on. Then
when I spoke of them, I saw I was right&mdash;I saw
how I'd frightened you. There was a secret&mdash;I
402
didn't know what; but it was something you were
ashamed of. Then, when you got engaged to that
other man, I understood&mdash;I knew you were afraid
of his finding it out. I used to write to him, warning
him. He never answered my letters, or paid
any attention&mdash;I guess he thought I was crazy; but
I had to keep on writing&mdash;I couldn't help it, somehow.
I had to do everything I did. It seemed as
if something urged me on. The only thing that
kept me from&mdash;from having my revenge was that
you might reap the benefit. And then this plan
came to me, and I saw how I could&mdash;get even&mdash;with
you both."

The hoarse, feeble voice grew fainter and died
away, as if from sheer exhaustion. Elizabeth interposed
an indignant protest. "And so," she said,
"you wanted me to suffer&mdash;for your crime? You
would have been glad if they had found me guilty?"

Amanda did not answer for a moment. "No,"
she said at last, "I didn't want you to die. I knew
you'd get off&mdash;every one said so&mdash;because you were
so pretty and so swell. They wouldn't"&mdash;the bitter
smile again hovered about her white lips&mdash;"they
wouldn't have said that about me. But&mdash;if they
had found you guilty"&mdash;she paused&mdash;"I had quite
made up my mind to confess. It was horrible lying
here, thinking it over&mdash;I don't believe death can be
worse. You couldn't have suffered&mdash;anything like
it; for you were innocent."

She looked at Elizabeth with a strange horror in
her eyes. Her face was ghastly, beads of perspiration
stood on her forehead, and on the little rings
403
of dark red hair, which clung about her temples.
"Oh, you don't know what it is," she said, "you
don't know what it is. It's the thought of that
that's killing me inch by inch; it's not the disease.
And yet I'm afraid&mdash;I'm afraid to confess"&mdash;her
voice broke piteously. "You don't want me to&mdash;do
you?&mdash;now that you've got off. It won't do
you any good&mdash;any longer, and as for me, though
I don't want to live, I'm afraid&mdash;to die." The
feeble voice again faltered and died away.

Elizabeth sat silent, her brain in a whirl. Before
her there rose the thought of the long months of
torture, the prison cell, the terrible, unnecessary
suspicion that still clouded her life.... If
Amanda would confess, it would be something.
People would never again believe her guilty. And
yet!&mdash;&mdash;

Mechanically, her eyes wandered about the room,
the incongruous setting for this strange scene&mdash;bright,
calm and peaceful; filled with the pictures of
martyred saints. Her gaze lingered fascinated on
the face of Christ in the engraving. It might have
been the effect of the light, or the over-wrought
state of her nerves which made it appear so real,
instinct with mysterious life and power. Almost it
seemed as if the lips moved, the sorrowful eyes
rested, with a look of infinite pity, on Amanda ... ...
"You won't betray me?" the feeble voice
pleaded. "I trusted you&mdash;you promised? You
won't break your word?"

"No"&mdash;Elizabeth spoke slowly and thoughtfully&mdash;"I
won't break my word. I did break a promise
404
I made you once, and repented it, ever since; but
this time I shall keep it. If you confess, it must be
for your own sake, not for mine. No one I care
about believes me guilty. Let it go."

Amanda drew a sigh of relief. Her head fell
back, her attitude of tension relaxed insensibly.

"You are very generous," she said, faintly. "I&mdash;I
won't be ungrateful." And then a silence fell upon
them. Amanda's eyes closed, she seemed exhausted.
Elizabeth, seeing this, got up.

"I had better go. You're very tired." No
answer came. But as she reached the door Amanda's
eyes unclosed, she turned her face towards her.

"Good-bye," she said. "I'm sorry you've&mdash;lost
your looks. Perhaps you'll&mdash;get them back." The
words came out with a great effort. And then she
turned her face away and said no more.

The Sister was waiting outside in the corridor.
She accompanied Elizabeth to the door of the
hospital.

As they parted she laid her hand for an instant
on the girl's arm, her grave, clear eyes scanned the
white, exhausted face.

"My dear," she said, "did your cousin tell you&mdash;what
she sent for you to say?"

Elizabeth met her gaze firmly, with eyes as clear
as her own. "It is a secret," she said, quietly. "I
promised&mdash;not to repeat it."

A cloud passed over the Sister's face; her hand
rested for a moment tenderly on Elizabeth's arm.
"Poor child!" was all she said. It would have
405
been hard to tell to whom she referred&mdash;Elizabeth
or Amanda.

An instant later the great hospital door swung
to, and Elizabeth found herself again in the outside
world.

Amanda lay absolutely still. She was conscious,
for the moment, of nothing but the utter vacuity of
exhaustion. It was only little by little that her
strength revived, her brain began to work, those
thoughts weighed upon her again, which were killing
her inch by inch.

It is hard to understand the processes of a mind
like Amanda's, diseased perhaps from the first, made
more so, as life went on, by illness and adverse circumstances.
As to how far she was accountable,
who can decide?...

One thing is certain, that some sort of moral
struggle now took place within her. Her brow was
contracted, her lips moved, now and then she
stirred uneasily. Her piteous gaze fastened half unconsciously,
as Elizabeth's had done, on the face of
the Christ in the engraving. For her as for Elizabeth,
the pictured eyes held a curious fascination.
But we read into inanimate objects, above all the
symbols of our faith, our own thoughts and convictions.
It was not pity which Amanda saw in the
sorrowful eyes which to her, too, seemed alive with
a singular power.

When the Sister came in, a little later, she asked
her a question.

"Isn't it enough if we confess our sins?" she
406
asked, feebly. "You said that would be enough to
have them forgiven."

The Sister looked down at her gravely. "Repentance
is not enough," she said, "unless we do
what we can to make amends."

Amanda turned away with a feeble moan.

It was late in the afternoon when she nerved herself,
as for a great effort. She called the Sister to
her and whispered. What she said did not seem
to cause surprise. The Sister's face brightened, she
left the room quickly. It was evident that she was
prepared for an emergency like this. An hour later
the small room was filled&mdash;there was a lawyer, witnesses....
Amanda's weak voice spoke steadily,
without a pause....

When it was over, she sank back exhausted, and
her eyes again sought the face in the engraving.
She found there what she expected. With a long
sigh of relief she turned her face to the wall and
slept. The Sister quietly pulled down the blind.

"She will rest now," she said softly, and it was
true. Amanda never awoke.


407
Chapter XL


"Don't you think," said Gerard, "that I
have waited long enough?"

It was five months later. The mellow
afternoon sunlight pierced the foliage, which,
interlacing, formed an arch overhead. Wild roses
grew in profusion along the roadside. Beyond, the
fields were thickly strewn with buttercups and
daisies. The air was fragrant with the scent of
honeysuckle.

Elizabeth wore a white gown; the hands carelessly
clasped before her were filled with June roses.
So far, she matched the day and the season. But
her head drooped languidly, like a wilting flower,
the country air had brought no color to her cheeks.
Lines of suffering still lingered about her mouth.
The eyes which were cast down, almost hidden by
their long lashes, held a latent shadow in their
depths.

The man by her side, who had just come up from
town, noted all this with a keen anxiety.

"Don't you think," he repeated, with an impatience
the greater for what her looks conveyed,
"don't you think that I have waited long enough?"

A quiver crossed her face, but she did not look
up. "It's not my fault that you have&mdash;waited,"
she murmured.
408

The man made a rueful gesture. "Oh, you need
not tell me that," he said. "If you had had your
way, you would have sent me&mdash;back to South
Africa, I believe." He broke off with a bitter laugh.
As if in spite of herself, a smile flickered beneath
her drooping lids.

"Not quite so far, perhaps." The words sounded
with a demure accent. But in an instant the smile
vanished, her lip quivered, she looked up at him with
a tremulous earnestness. "Ah, can't you understand,"
she cried, "why I want you to go? Haven't
I brought you trouble enough? Do you think that
now"&mdash;she paused and caught her breath&mdash;"now
that all this disgrace has come upon me," she went
on with an effort, "do you think I would burden
you with it?"

"Disgrace!"&mdash;He flushed hotly.&mdash;"I don't know
why there should be disgrace," he said, "when every
one knows now&mdash;even those idiots who doubted you&mdash;how
baseless the whole miserable accusation was."

"People don't reason." She sighed wearily.
"There will always be a cloud over me&mdash;I feel it
even here. People at The Mills stare at me, the
Neighborhood"&mdash;she smiled painfully&mdash;"the Neighborhood
feels that I have brought upon it eternal
discredit. Ah, you can't blame them"&mdash;as Gerard
muttered under his breath an ejaculation. "It will
be the same in town&mdash;everywhere. People will always
remember that I was horribly talked about,
that I have been in prison. For myself"&mdash;her lip
trembled&mdash;"I'm hardened, but for you"&mdash;

"For me"&mdash;he put out his hand and took hers
409
determinedly into his strong grasp&mdash;"for me it is
inevitable that, whatever troubles you have, I must
share them."

There was silence for a moment. They stood
facing each other, the only actors in the peaceful
country scene; the man strong, determined, his eyes
aglow with the fire of mastery; the woman pale,
drooping, exhausted, yet still with some power in
her weakness, that opposed itself to his strength.
She put out her hand at last in a gesture of entreaty.
"Ah, don't let us go all over this again,"
she pleaded. "Don't make it so hard for me. It's
hard enough"&mdash;The words seemed to escape her
unawares.

"Ah!" A gleam of triumph crossed his face.
"It is hard, then?"

"Most things are hard."&mdash;She spoke with recovered
firmness.&mdash;"Life is hard, but one must&mdash;bear
it. At least I'll try to bear it&mdash;alone. The only
amends I can make to you"&mdash;she clasped her hands
suddenly in a passionate gesture of renunciation&mdash;"the
only atonement is to efface myself, to sink out
of your life as if I had never&mdash;been in it." She
paused, her breath came in convulsive gasps, but
still she faced him resolute, the look in her eyes with
which some penitent of the early church might have
welcomed lifelong immolation. "To efface myself,"
she repeated, dwelling upon the words as if
they held some painful satisfaction, "to sink out of
your life&mdash;it is the only atonement I can make."

"You can't make it." Gerard's words rang out
clearly. He took her hands again resolutely in his.
410
"You can't efface yourself," he said. "It's beyond
your power." A smile flickered across his face, his
eyes looked into hers with an imperious tenderness,
before which they fell abashed. "Do you know,"
he said, "why I went off in that idiotic fashion into
the wilds, tried to cut myself off from the world?
I was bitter, angry&mdash;I wanted to forget you; I
thought, if there were nothing to remind me of you,
I might. And then day and night I thought of you,
day and night your face haunted me.... Ah,
Elizabeth"&mdash;his voice broke&mdash;"ask me to do anything
except&mdash;forget you."

There was again silence. Elizabeth's lips parted,
her breath fluttered, a warm, lovely color flooded
her face. He thought she had yielded. But almost
instantly the color faded, she drew her hands from
his grasp and shrank away, as if under the weight
of some painful memory. "And,&mdash;and that deception,"
she gasped out. "What has happened to
change that? You said&mdash;don't you remember?&mdash;that
you could never"&mdash;her voice quivered&mdash;"never
trust me again." She lifted her head suddenly, she
looked him firmly, steadily, in the face, with eyes
that seemed the index to her soul. "I did deceive
you," she said. "Nothing can change that fact.
Why should you trust me now?"

"Ah, it would be hard on most of us"&mdash;the words
sprung impetuously to his lips&mdash;"if there were no
forgiveness, if strict justice were always meted
out." He put out his hand in a passionate gesture,
a rush of feeling thrilled his voice. "Elizabeth,"
411
he cried, "don't bring up words which I said that
night in anger, which I have repented&mdash;God knows!&mdash;ever
since. You had done an heroic thing in telling
me the truth at last, just when it was hardest&mdash;I&mdash;brute
that I was&mdash;could only think of my own
misery. But let the past go&mdash;it shall not ruin our
lives any longer." He put his arm around her and
drew her towards him. He felt her heart beat, her
pulses throb; his voice took on a deeper note of
tenderness. "The future is ours, and love is ours&mdash;my
darling, does anything else matter?"

The argument may not have been a wise one, but
it has gained more victories than all the logic in the
world. Elizabeth, weary of struggling, resigned
herself to her defeat....

Later she looked up, gave a little, fluttering sigh,
and her eyes sought his with a wistful sweetness.
"Dear, I'm not worth it," she murmured, "but I
will try&mdash;oh, I will try so hard." ... Gerard,
smiling, cut the sentence short.

They walked on homeward through the fragrant
lanes, in which they two seemed the only wanderers.
The Misses Van Vorst, sitting by the drawing-room
windows, saw them come with a little thrill of
anxiety. Miss Joanna dropped a stitch in her knitting,
and Miss Cornelia's thin, silvery curls fluttered,
as if stirred by some intangible wave of sympathy.

Elizabeth crossed the flower-studded lawn and
came towards them, her white skirts swaying about
her in the gentle summer wind. She held her head
erect, her color was brilliant, her eyes lustrous. The
412
setting sun shone on her hair and lit it up into a
vivid glory. Elizabeth's aunts stole a glance at her,
at the look on Gerard's face. Then their eyes met
and they smiled softly at each other through a mist
of tears.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
