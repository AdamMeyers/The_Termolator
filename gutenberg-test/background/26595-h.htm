<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The question of the technical phases of
education is, with any nation, a vital one.
Perhaps this is true of Germany as it is of
no other European country. This may be
mainly due to one of several causes. First,
as to the length of time technical education
has had a place in the German schools. In
some form or another, and in a greater or
lesser degree, such instruction has been in
vogue for many years, and has in no small
measure become part and parcel of the
educational fabric of the nation. Again,
throughout the various German States, the
work is rather widely differentiated, this
owing in part to the fact that the varying
lines of industry in adjacent localities even,
give color and bent to the technical education
of any particular locality. An extensive
field is thus comprehended under the
term &#8220;technical education&#8221;. Then, too,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>Germany as a nation must needs better her
condition in order that she may prove self-sustaining.
The country is not a wealthy
one, and if in trade, in manufacture, and in
commerce, she is to compete, and that successfully,
with the world powers, strength
must be gained along such lines as those
opening through technical education.</p>

<p>The hope is entertained that the following
pages may prove of value, not alone to the
student of technical education as it exists in
Germany, but particularly to those who are
endeavoring to institute and develop industrial
and technical training in this country.
The possibility along these lines is exceedingly
great and the interest and attention of
thinking people is focused here. They look
to this form of education as a partial solution
of some of the most obstinate problems
now confronting us.</p>

strike, which resulted in four changes in foremen.
This, together with the fact that the author was
upon the Pacific coast and proof was delayed and
sometimes lost has led to errors for which he is not
responsible. Besides typographical blunders easily

Technical Education<br />
in Germany</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Prof. Arthur Henry Chamberlain</span></p>




<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>


<p>If one were to point out the most distinctive
feature of the educational system in the
Fatherland to-day, it would perhaps be the
highly specialized condition of the technical
schools.</p>

<p>In approaching our problem we naturally
ask ourselves the question as to how far the
industrial progress of a country is influenced
by technical education. In no time as in
our own has so much stress been laid upon
the commercial side of our existence. New
trades, new industries are springing up;
specialization is becoming more far-reaching
and more firmly established than ever before;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>competition is becoming keener; the
application of science to the arts is more
varied.</p>

<p>In this latter field we find Germany in the
very fore front, she having developed along
these lines to a greater extent than have
many of our nations. Illustrations of this
application lie all about us,&mdash;in the bettered
transportation facilities by railroad and by
ocean vessel; in the more improved bridge
and building construction; in the methods
of water supply and drainage; in modes of
heat, light, and ventilation; in electric vehicles,
sound transmitters, labor-saving
machinery; in finely adjusted instruments
that bring far away worlds almost within
reaching distance; in these and a thousand
other ways is made manifest the result of
the application of science to the arts. Germany
is taking a prominent part in this
warfare for industrial supremacy, and that
she expects her technical schools to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>largely instrumental in answering many of
the problems of the present and the future
cannot be doubted, especially when one is
made aware of the diversity and extent of
the schools of a technical character scattered
over the Empire.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood from the
foregoing how difficult a matter it is to
make any one classification that will cover
in an adequate manner the various types of
existing institutions. Frequently a school
is found which in some respects is distinctive.
To place such a school in this or that
category would of course do violence to the
classification, while to form a new class
only serves to further complicate and bewilder.
Again, various of the institutions
mentioned may offer such a differentiated
schedule or be made up of so many parallel
departments as to entitle them to admission
into two or more of the classes given.</p>

<p>Another point of difficulty lies in the fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>that the term &#8220;technical&#8221; would in Germany
be somewhat more sweeping than with
us in America. We do not class technical
training with so-called manual training or
handwork of the elementary schools. In
our present study however, we shall find
that while in the main we are dealing with
the technical training of boys from fourteen
to eighteen years of age,&mdash;comparable in a
measure to our high or secondary school
courses, we shall also include the industrial,
vocational, or trade training of men and
boys alike, as well as work in the more simplified
forms of handicraft, as carried on in
the lower or elementary school. Reference
will also be made to the instruction of a
higher order,&mdash;such for example as makes
for engineers. These facts will be illuminated
as the study proceeds.</p>

<p>In reading into these schools their real
significance, several points must be kept
constantly in mind. At an early age the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>German youth is supposed to have solved
the problem of his likes and dislikes, his
abilities and shortcomings; to have gained
such a perspective of his probable chances
for future success, as to choose the line of
work or occupation he shall follow. It is
only fair to state, however, that circumstances
have much to do with such decision,
viz,&mdash;the occupation of the father, the financial
outlook of the family, the industrial
demands of the locality, the particular educational
opportunities offered,&mdash;these and
like problems entering in as vital elements.</p>

<p>Then too, the founding and sustaining
of a technical school is a matter to be noted.
This may be in the hands of the general
government, of the state, of the municipality,
or may be looked after by private enterprise.
The Guilds, Vereins or Associations
may organize, equip and foster schools of
such character as train directly for their
particular lines of work. It must be stated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>however in this connection, that there
seems to be a strong tendency at the present
time toward the centralizing of control in
the states. This has been brought about in
large measure through the ever-increasing
willingness on the part of the state to give
financial backing to the schools, and thus
has quite naturally arisen the desire and
necessity on the part of the state, that it
have a controlling voice in the school administration.
Herein lies one of the main
differences between such education in Germany
and that of our own country.</p>

<p>Conrad&#8217;s Handw&ouml;rterbuch der Staatswissenschaften,
1900, in an article entitled
&#8220;Gewerblicher Unterricht&#8221;, gives the following
table on state expenditure for trade
and technical instruction in recent years:</p>

<p class="center">Prussia:</p>

<ul class="indented">
<li>Marks 142,000 ($33,796) in 1874;</li>

<li>Marks 475,000 ($114,050) in 1885;</li>

<li>Marks 4,672,000 ($1,111,936) in 1899.</li>
</ul>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Saxony:</p>

<ul class="indented">
<li>Marks 235,000 ($60,214) in 1873;</li>

<li>Marks 570,000 ($135,660) in 1885;</li>

<li>Marks 1,138,000 ($270,844) in 1898.</li>
</ul>

<p class="center">Wurttemburg industrial continuation school:</p>

<ul class="indented">
<li>Marks, 58,000 ($13,804) in 1869;</li>

<li>Marks 129,000 ($30,702) in 1879;</li>

<li>Marks 164,000 ($39,032) in 1889;</li>

<li>Marks 208,000 ($49,504) in 1897.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cost of the state per capita of the
population of the expenditures was as follows:</p>

<ul class="indented">
<li>Prussia, Pfennigs 15 (3&frac12; cts.) in 1899;</li>

<li>Saxony, Pfennigs 29 (7 cts.) in 1898;</li>

<li>Hesse, Pfennigs 22 (5 cts.) in 1898.</li>
</ul>


<p>The cost per Marks 1,000 ($236) of the
entire state expenditures was Marks 2.27
(54 cts.) in Prussia in 1899, and Marks
5.88 ($1.40) in Saxony in 1898.</p>

<p>In general the German schools are classified
upon a basis of the grade of instruction
given rather than upon the character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>of the subjects taught. Primary education
is compulsory, that is to say, all children
are compelled by law to attend school from
their sixth to their fourteenth year. It is
at this point that we find our difficulty. To
quote Dr. Alwin Pabst of Leipzig (who
speaks of conditions governing technical
schools):</p>

<p>&#8220;The age of admission, length of course,
fees and other conditions (examinations)
of these schools differ widely. Ages range
from fourteen to thirty years or over; length
of course, one to four or five years; fees
perhaps twenty to thirty marks per year.
The Fortbildungsschule is the only institution
in which no fee is charged.&#8221; (Taken
from a personal letter.)</p>

<p>Several classifications commend themselves
for use. Each has its weaknesses and
breaks down at some point, owing to the
conditions previously mentioned. In order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>the better to illustrate this difficulty I shall
give these various possible classifications.</p>

<p>The first refers chiefly to the scheme of
secondary education and was the one first
chosen and later discarded. It was suggested
mainly by Sir Philip Magnus&#8217;s work
on &#8220;Industrial Education&#8221; and the &#8220;Report
of the Industrial Commission&#8221;, Vol. 1.</p>

<ul class="indented">
<li>1. Industrieschulen
<ul>
<li>Gewerbeschulen</li>
</ul></li>

<li>2. Trade Schools
<ul>
<li>Fachschulen</li>
</ul></li>

<li>3. Building Trade Schools</li>

<li>4. Secondary Technical Schools
<ul>
<li>Higher Technical</li>
<li>Foremen</li>
<li>Building</li>
<li>Weaving</li>

<li>5. Industrial Art Schools (Kunstgewerbe)
<ul>
<li>Pure Art</li>
<li>Applied Art</li>
</ul></li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>6. Polytechnics or Technische Hochschulen</li>

<li>7. Continuation Schools&mdash;Fortbildungsschulen</li>
</ul>

<p>Another classification, suggested in most
part by a German authority is as follows:</p>

<ul class="indented">
<li>1. Fortbildungsschulen&mdash;Continuation
schools</li>

<li>2. Industrie&mdash;or Fachschulen&mdash;Special
Trade Schools</li>

<li>3. Gewerbeschulen</li>

<li>4. Technische Schulen</li>

<li>5. Technische Hochschulen</li>

<li>6. Baugewerkschulen&mdash;School for Architects</li>

<li>7. Kunstgewerbeschulen&mdash;Schools of Art</li>
</ul>


<p>In the Seventeenth Annual Report of the
U.&nbsp;S. Commissioner of Labor for 1902 we
find the following:</p>

<ul class="indented">
<li>1. Technical Colleges</li>

<li>2. Secondary or Intermediate Technical
Schools</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>3. Schools and Museums of Industrial
Art</li>

<li>4. Schools for Foremen</li>

<li>5. Schools for the Textile Trades</li>

<li>6. Trade and Industrial Continuation
Schools</li>

<li>7. Industrial Drawing Courses</li>

<li>8. Other Institutions for Industrial Education.</li>
</ul>


<p>The order followed in the present study
is finally given below. It is one not to be
found elsewhere, but more closely resembles
that of Dr. Pabst (the second classification)
and that found in the Seventeenth Annual
Report of the Commissioner of Labor. It
has undoubtedly its weak points, but I
feel it is the best that can be made however,
as it is based upon data recently published,
and the results of correspondence with
German school authorities, in addition to
a not very extended knowledge gained
through personal contact with the German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>schools. It may be taken therefore, as
bringing the work down to the present
time:</p>

<ul class="indented">
<li>1. Continuation Schools or Fortbildungsschulen</li>

<li>2. Trade Schools or Fachschulen</li>

<li>3. Secondary or Intermediate Technical
Schools or Gewerbliche Mittelschulen</li>

<li>4. Technical Colleges or Technische
Hochschulen</li>

<li>5. School and Museums of Industrial Art,
or Kunstgewerbeschulen</li>
</ul>

<p class="subheader"><span class="smcap">Continuation Schools</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Fortbildungsschulen</span></p>


<p>Since at the age of fourteen years the
German youth is no longer under the control
of the compulsory school law, the value
of the system of continuation schools is realized.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Of necessity the great mass of boys
are at this age, forced to enter some gainful
pursuit. It was clearly evident to the German
people that boys should not be cut off
from school education at this early age.
Dr. James H. Russell in his German Higher
Schools says:</p>

<p>&#8220;The elementary and secondary schools
are quite independent of each other&mdash;not
one boy in ten thousand finds his way from
the highest class of the elementary school
into the Gymnasium.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is evident that year by year an increasingly
large number of boys discontinue
their education at the close of the elementary
school, for a statement made by Mr.
Michael N. Sadler, (Vol. III of Special Reports
on Educational Subjects, London),
some years prior to the above writing,
would seem to indicate a lesser percentage
of dropping out than that proposed by Dr.
Russell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>The desire then for more extended educational
advantages must have been early
felt, and there sprang into existence what
has since developed into one of the most
significant features and far-reaching factors
in the German scheme,&mdash;the continuation
school. I quote from Mr. H. Bertram who
writes of the continuation schools in Berlin,
December, 1899:</p>

<p>&#8220;Amid the development of civilization
among the nations the idea of the continuation
school is making its way with increasing
strength. Urgently required by the
conditions of social organization, and in its
turn acting on them, the new institution
appears in many forms. It claims its place
side by side with the Church and the
School.</p>

<p>&#8220;Among the great number of those who enter
early upon the practical business of life, to
whom the primary school has offered a start
there awakens, sooner or later, the desire to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>share in the stores of knowledge which human
intelligence has won, in the insight
into the working of the forces of nature,
which it has acquired and applied to industry,
in the arts which ennoble and support
human action; in short to participate in the
spiritual treasures which are, as it were, the
birthright of those born under a luckier
star. This desire, which opens to the diligent
the way to material prosperity and
inner contentment, seems for society as a
whole an important incentive to industrial
progress, and turns the discontent of the
slaves of machinery into happiness of men
conscious of their own success. The more
the old order changes which held the work
people in the narrow bonds of tradition, the
more is customary prescription replaced by
education and independent judgment, by
insight into existing conditions, by special
excellence within a particular sphere. For
this reason, the elementary school, however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>efficient and methodically correct its action
may be, cannot suffice for the happiness of
the masses, nor for the preservation of society.
The instruction must come into close
contact with the life of the future citizen,
and must be at the command of everyone
desirous to learn, as long as he seeks it.
But the seeker, born amid such conditions
as these, needs guidance. Public libraries,
newspapers, magazines help him the more
he pushes forward, but without expert assistance
he hardly finds the beginning of the
path.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the object of the Continuation
School.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to define the
limits and scope of the continuation or Fortbildungsschulen.
Conditions vary in the
different German states and especially do
they vary in the various kinds of continuation
schools. Definition is made even
more doubtful when we find that the limits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>of certain schools overlap. It may be said
that students are regularly admitted from
fourteen to sixteen years of age. Not infrequently
however, boys and men of more
mature years take advantage of the courses
offered. Instruction is carried on during
the week-day evenings from six to eight
o&#8217;clock and on Sunday mornings.</p>

<p>Prussia leads the other states in the number
and character of her supplementary
schools, the system having its fullest expression
in Berlin. The fact became early
apparent that preparation, whatever line
the boy was to follow, was necessary, and
this thought is confirmed in the many
skilled laborers in Germany to-day. In
Prussia, as elsewhere, it was found that
boys many times left the common school before
they became proficient in any line of
book work. The causes were various; poverty,
indifference, sickness, overcrowding,
poor enforcement of the compulsory attendance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>laws,&mdash;all these conspired to make
supplementary schools necessary. In the
older provinces very little attention was
given the continuation school prior to 1875,
and almost as much could be said of those
provinces which were acquired in 1866. In
1844 a report issued by the Department of
Public Instruction makes mention of the
usefulness of such schools, while two years
later a second report has only slightly more
to say on the subject. This lack of interest
may be attributed in large measure to the
non-financial support of these schools by the
government.</p>

<p>Several problems had to be faced in working
out the scheme. Certain definite relations
between the primary and continuation
schools must be observed; those coming into
the latter with an inadequate underschool
knowledge must be looked after;
provision must be made for students of
lesser as well as of more mature years; all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>classes of occupation must be given attention;
these and many other difficult questions
were to be met and overcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three principles,&#8221; says Mr. Bertram,
&#8220;have contributed to the solution of this
problem&mdash;free choices between the courses
provided, free enjoyment of the preparatory
courses without fee, and the selection of the
teachers according to their attainments in
a particular branch and their ability to adapt
their instruction to the needs of the pupils
or participants in the course.&#8221;</p>

<p>In certain sections, Nassau and Hanover
for example, state aid came early to the
continuation school. In 1874 an increased
appropriation resulted in the betterment of
the schools then existing and in the further
establishment of like institutions. Here
the communities must meet the cost of building,
heating, lighting etc., and one-half of
all the expenses not covered by the actual
tuition. Since 1878 there is a fairly general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>acceptance throughout the Empire of the
statute providing that all employes under
eighteen years of age must be allowed to attend
a continuation school, the period of
attendance to be determined by &#8220;competent
authority&#8221;. This naturally leads the
Public Instruction Department to be free
in its financial support.</p>

<p>It will be understood that in most cases
six hours per week is the attendance required
and that only those who have left
the Volksschule or lower school and are not
attending any higher institution are admitted.
In Saxony a somewhat different
condition exists. Children who have not
made satisfactory progress in the Volksschule
must, perforce, attend the continuation
school for two years.</p>

<p>The writer of this paper was thoroughly
impressed with the work of the Sunday
classes as seen in Leipzig, Saxony, during
the summer of 1899. His first introduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>to such work was made, when on joining
a group of boys, several of them carrying
draughting-boards, he was conducted
by them to their school. The general
character and deportment of the boys, the
spirit and enthusiasm manifested by them,
and the thoughtful and intelligent quality
of the work produced, fully justified in his
own mind, the validity and worth of the
Sunday class instruction.</p>

<p>As between the schools located in the
cities and those in the smaller towns and
country places, there is some slight difference.
They may be classified as (<i>a</i>) rural
or (<i>b</i>) city schools, on account of their location.
The distinction lies rather in the
arrangement of their curricula, the needs
of the students in the particular locality
being kept in mind. In the rural schools the
programme of studies is somewhat general,
comprising the German language, arithmetic,
mensuration, nature study; and in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>instances may be added to these, geography,
German history, drawing, gymnastics
and music. This programme is elective to
the extent that the capacity and previous
education of the pupil are considered, and
too, the ability of the teacher, local conditions
and the time spent by the individual
student. Such schools are admonished not
to take on the character of technical institutions,
but rather to continue the general
education begun in the Volksschulen.
Only under certain conditions is less than
four hours per week of instruction permissible.</p>

<p>In Prussia the city continuation schools
are of two grades, each grade made up of a
number of classes. In the lower grade
schools, instruction is given in accordance
with the particular trade or calling the pupil
is to follow. In the upper grade, work
is much the same, proficiency being the
chief additional feature. When six hours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>of work is the minimum, language, arithmetic,
elementary geometry and drawing,
form the body of the course; while penmanship,
geography, history, grammar and
nature study all are taken up in connection
with the reading work. Business forms are
not overlooked. In the more fully
equipped schools where the teachers are prepared
for such branches, higher mathematics,
mechanics, physics and advanced
drawing are taken up.</p>

<p>If, as before stated, the various types of
continuation schools overlap, the same is
true regarding the trade and industrial
continuation schools. While in many instances
the work in the latter schools is of
a general character, aiming to supplement
or round out the education of the pupil, we
find that many of the original schools of this
class have developed into a form of special
or trade school. This is brought about
through pressure from without, as it were.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>When a certain industry predominates in a
locality supporting a continuation school, it
is only fair to suppose that the work done,
general though it may be, will be colored
to some extent at least, by the demands of
such industry. If this process of merging
is carried sufficiently far, as is in many cases
done, the school may lose almost or entirely
its original trend, and from a Fortbildungsschule,
fall into the class of trade or Fachschulen.</p>

<p>In the main then, the instruction given
in a continuation school proper, is either of
a theoretical nature or involves some form
of drawing perhaps, thus rendering any
other than an ordinary school room unnecessary
for class use. In the city of
Leipzig the situation is dissimilar to that
in some north German cities. Here
the classes are arranged according to the
various trades followed, as bookbinders,
printers, lithographers, bakers, metal workers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>workers in wood and stone, etc. There
are again in Southern Germany simply
schools of drawing with special reference
to the various trades and industries. In
addition to these are classes of a general
nature for boys not following special trades.
Such schools however, cannot be found in
the smaller towns or in the country. Certain
other Saxon cities have schools of
somewhat similar character.</p>

<p>In the Consular Report, Vol. 54, No. 202,
page 447, 1898, Mr. J.&nbsp;C. Monoghan says,
writing under the title Technical Education
in Germany:</p>

<p>&#8220;The supplementary schools are for the
people who have to work, what Chautauquas,
summer schools, and university extension
courses are for others.&mdash;Parties in politico-economic
circles have found that the system
of common school education under which
boys and girls were given an ordinary education
in reading, writing, arithmetic etc.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>up to their fourteenth year, was inadequate,
partially if not wholly, to the ends aimed at
in such a system. To supply this defect it
was urged, and finally proposed and favorably
acted upon, that graduates of the common
schools, boys especially, in some few
cases girls too, should continue to get instruction
a certain number of hours a week.
This was made compulsory. Manufacturers,
shopkeepers, and mechanics in whose
employ such boys were found, and not the
parents, were made responsible for the boys&#8217;
attendance. In these schools, as indicated
in the foregoing, the boys get as good an
idea as possible of the trade or branch of
business in which they are employed. As
a rule, the hours of attendance are early in
the morning or a certain number of afternoons
in the week. Sunday mornings are
not thought too sacred for such work. It
seems to be an acknowledgement that the
years hitherto given to a boy in which to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>get an education, viz., from his sixth to
his fourteenth year, are not enough to
prepare him for the struggle for life that he
has to enter upon. Men have told me, successful
merchants and agents here, that
they owe more to the hours spent in the
developing or supplementary schools from
the practical character of the instruction
given and the information imparted, than
to the many years spent in the common
schools. While one is hardly willing to believe
this, there can be no doubt of the good
work done, and being done, by the schools
referred to.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Handwerkschulen in Berlin are very
similar to Fortbildungsschulen in Leipzig
for example. These schools have seen a
marvelous development during the past
few years. They have a technical quality,
giving much attention to drawing. The
sessions are in the evening, eight hours per
week, the fee being six marks the half year.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>They are attended by journeymen and apprentices
who come recommended by their
employers. In connection with these
schools various Sunday classes are conducted
throughout the city, each center specializing
along certain trade lines.</p>

<p>The Berlin Handwerker Verein is a type
of continuation school, sustained not by the
state but by an association. The Verein,
founded in 1859, has for its object the promotion
of general culture, a partial knowledge
at least of the several callings represented,
and good manners (gute Sitten).
The moral and ethical elements are not
lacking. Here public lectures of real merit
are given, together with music, gymnastics,
and instruction in general and technical
subjects. Boys of good character, over
seventeen years of age, are admitted. The
families of the boys in attendance are also
allowed to avail themselves of such general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>exercises, lectures, music, etc., as the school
offers.</p>

<p>What may also be styled as belonging in
a sense in the continuation school category
is the German Association for the Diffusion
of Popular Education, with headquarters
in Berlin. Branches of this association are
scattered throughout various parts of the
Empire.</p>

<p>In the year 1869, the industrial code provided
that all boys under eighteen years of
age might, at the discretion of the local
authorities, be compelled to attend school.
It is thus evident that the local or State
authority was here consulted, rather than
the General Government. At the present
time however, when the adjustment of this
matter is not in the hands of local authority,
the employer must, if those engaged with
him desire so to do, allow such boys to attend
school at their option. In some States
however, Saxony, Bavaria, Hesse and Baden,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>compulsory school laws are in force among
all boys fourteen to eighteen years of age.
At present the law of 1891 is active and the
portion touching our problem is here given:</p>

<p>&#8220;Employers are required to give the
necessary time, to be determined eventually
by the competent authorities, to their workingmen
under eighteen years of age who
attend an educational establishment recognized
by the communal administration or
by the State as an adult&#8217;s school. Instruction
shall not be given on Sunday except
where the hours are so fixed that the pupils
are not prevented from attending the principal
religious exercise or a religious exercise
of their faith especially conducted for
them with the consent of the ecclesiastical
authorities. The central administration
may, until October 1, 1894, accord exemptions
from the last provision to adult
schools already in existence, attendance upon
which is not obligatory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>&#8220;For purposes of this law schools giving
instruction in manual work and domestic
duties to women shall be considered as
adult schools.&#8221;</p>

<p>This citation points out that the Sunday
class work must not conflict with the religious
services. There is a strong sentiment
in many places in favor of a repeal of
such laws as prohibit Sunday classes at
such times as church services are held.
Many of the clergy are opposed to the extending
of Sunday continuation schools,
while for the most part the government
authorities are favorable to such extension.</p>

<p>As regards the compulsory age limit,
Prussia of all the German states is following
out the option given the individual
States. It is worthy of note that she declares
(while declining to accept the law)
that where freedom is allowed, boys are
more likely to continue in school after their
eighteenth year. It is insisted also that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>with the restrictions removed, a deeper interest
is excited in the school studies. The
statement is made however that in Prussia
two thirds of the industrial continuation
schools have compulsory attendance laws in
force as the local authorities may determine.
Certain it is that much stress is
laid upon the ethical side of instruction in
the continuation schools and it is agreed
that the compulsory school should not
transplant the regular continuation school,
except where it seems absolutely necessary to
do so. In Bavaria for example, where the
age limit by law is thirteen, the compulsory
school has a place for the time being
at least.</p>

<p>In Berlin, a century ago, Sunday afternoon
classes were inaugurated, with a programme
no more varied than that furnished
by the three R&#8217;s. Apprentices not equipped
with sufficient school training were forced
to attend the schools. In 1869 the power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>was wrested from the trade guilds and the
elective system resulted, later producing
the Elementary Continuation School. The
local city government founded at a later
date three such schools, and in these a
more diversified curriculum was operated,
adding to the three R&#8217;s, German composition
and literature, modern languages, natural
science, political science, law, bookkeeping
and drawing. For various reasons
these schools were not attended by a full
measure of success and the city authorities
formulated the plan of placing the continuation
schools in some of the higher institutions
of learning, courses to be operative in
winter only. Later, from the preparatory
school, which fitted for the continuation
school proper, grew up the technical continuation
school.</p>

<p>There are at the present twelve schools
of the continuation type in Berlin. A large
attendance is desired, for with large classes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>groups of various intellectual standards may
be formed. The student is free to elect
subjects&mdash;as between certain languages,
mathematics or art studies. The Director
of the school, by keeping in touch with the
employers in the various trades and shops,
can thus control the attendance and shape
the course of the lines of work offered.</p>

<p>Some ten years since, two special lines of
instruction were withdrawn from the continuation
school proper&mdash;the carpenters&#8217;
school and the Gewerbesaal, comprising
work in drawing and theory involved in
machine construction and the like. Courses
for turners are offered in the carpenters&#8217;
schools. In Berlin there are in excess of
nine centers for the last named school and
ten centers for the Gewerbesaal, the winter
classes running up to 2000 and 850 pupils
respectively.</p>

<p>This example serves to illustrate the fact
mentioned in a previous connection, viz.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>that the Fortbildungsschule was in some
cases merged into a special school, for here
in reality a Fach or trade institution has developed
from the original continuation
school. This practice has been going on
more or less extensively among the various
schools; and in Berlin especially, the continuation
school has been the foundation of
most of the Fachschulen. Something more
will be said in this connection in the section
under trade schools.</p>

<p>Regarding the continuation schools for
girls and women a word may be added. As
with the boys&#8217; schools, so these designed
for girls were put on foot, partly at least,
from an ethical standpoint. Girls spending
their days in the factory and shop were in
need of a refining influence, and this the
continuation school afforded. Courses were
offered in the German language, arithmetic,
sewing and dressmaking. The efforts made
to give girls this training were not entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>successful. So many objections to Sunday
work were brought forward that it was discontinued.
The burdens of the day fell so
heavily upon the girls that they were not
ambitious to attend evening classes. At the
present time the schools are more largely
attended by girls who, during the day, remain
in the family, and in the school take
up the household arts, sewing, cutting out,
and the like, and also languages, mathematics,
geography, etc., gymnastics and music,
shorthand and typewriting. It is hoped
soon to introduce cookery in all girls&#8217;
schools. Drawing is given much attention.</p>

<p>There are in Berlin, nine municipal continuation
schools for girls, which are, as the
name indicates, maintained by the city.</p>

<p class="subheader"><span class="smcap">Trade Schools</span><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>


<p>As has been indicated in another connection,
the classification of trade schools as
such, is somewhat uncertain. It has been
shown that many of the present schools for
special trades have evolved from the continuation
schools of the past. In the transition
state it is sometimes quite difficult to
definitely place a certain school, whether in
the trade continuation, or trade group proper,
or to class it with the Industrieschulen.
The trade continuation schools have largely
superseded the regular trade schools, in
many localities at least, and where this condition
exists, trade instruction seems to be
losing ground, here the Fortbildungsschulen
on the one hand, and regular ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>prenticeships
on the other, coming in to supplant
trade teaching.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The two previous articles were published in the School
Bulletin for July and August, 1906.</p></div>

<p>The seeming contradictory statements
made here must be interpreted in the spirit
rather than in the letter, if the full meaning
and significance of the trade school is to be
grasped. Trades are taught as formerly.
The point made is that while the trade
school, per se, is doing its work, boys are,
more and more, being trained for their
trades in the so-called trades continuation
schools and as apprentices in the shops. The
latter form of training will be spoken of elsewhere
in this section of the paper.</p>

<p>We have noted in following the work of
the continuation school, that the attempt
has been mainly toward the teaching of theoretical
subjects, the practical lines being
carried forward in the regular daily occupations
of the individuals. Hence the trade is
not held specifically in mind, although the
desired end is always kept in view. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>trade schools on the other hand, the work is
largely of a practical nature, dealing with
some particular occupation. The foregoing
statement may be taken as fairly representing
the Fachschule point of view, but it
should be observed that while these schools
are special trade schools, training for example
iron workers, or joiners, or tailors, there
is a differentiation within the general class.
I refer to the Gewerbeschulen, where theoretical
lessons are sometimes taught. These
schools will be given mention in the secondary
group.</p>

<p>Admission to the trade schools is gained
usually at fourteen years of age, the length
of each course covering a period of three
years. The schools are in receipt of financial
aid from both state and local governments.</p>

<p>To simplify our study, we shall consider
only such institutions as deal with a single
trade each, leaving the schools for the building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>trades and the like, and those dealing
with industrial art and drawing to be treated
elsewhere. Specialization has been carried
so far that the following lists of schools, each
training for its own particular trade or calling,
may be given. The list is arranged alphabetically
and without reference to the
relative importance of the various vocations,
or to the number of schools. Such schools
are now found pretty generally in the larger
cities throughout the Empire. Some of
these are day schools; some evening schools,
and others again offer both day and evening
courses and Sunday instruction.</p>

<p>Some of the above named institutions are
in certain localities styled apprenticeship
schools. These train workmen and foremen
of a minor degree. Shop work is offered,
and in some cases pure and applied art as
well.</p>

<p>The evening work of the so-called Artisans&#8217;
Schools of Berlin, are deserving of special
mention. There are two such institutions,
called respectively school number one and
school number two. The first was established
in 1880; the second in 1892. The
aim of these schools is to give to tradesmen
and apprentices in their leisure hours such
a knowledge of drawing, the arts and
sciences, as will find an application in their
own lines of work.</p>

<p>The grade of instruction varies from quite
elementary work to that for advanced students,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>the latter being obliged to present
evidence of fitness before entering.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that whereas certain
enactments are in force regarding the
Sunday sessions of the Fortbildungsschulen,
there are no such restrictions placed upon
the Fachschulen, Sunday morning classes
being held at the discretion of the school
authorities.</p>

<p>Let us refer to our table of single trade
schools as given above. The statements
which follow have in most cases been taken
from data relating to the schools of Berlin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>and may be said to fairly represent the general
existing conditions throughout the
Empire.</p>

<p>In the school for bakers, instruction is
given one day weekly for two and one half
hours. The theoretical work (which in common
with all such work in the regular trade
schools, is related directly to the particular
trade under discussion) is made up of chemistry
and bookkeeping.</p>

<p>In the barbers&#8217; and hairdressers&#8217; schools,
instruction is carried on six days each week,
four hours daily, the school continuing six
months of the year, covering the winter
period. Each class receives fourteen hours
instruction per week. While the bakers&#8217;
school is supported by the guild, the barbers&#8217;
school is jointly maintained by state,
city and guild. The curriculum includes
shaving, hair cutting, and hair dressing,
wig making, and ladies&#8217; hair dressing. A
tuition of three marks is charged for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>term, in the case of apprentices, and six
marks for journeymen; a charge five times
as great is made for ladies&#8217; hair dressing,
and for the surgical lectures, ten marks.</p>

<p>The guild, state and municipality maintain
the school for basketmakers and wickerworkers.
Apprentices receive instruction
free, four marks each semester being charged
the journeymen and adults. Attendance is
compulsory on the part of apprentices of
guild members. Four hours work per week
are given, on Saturdays. The annual expenses
of the school, are about five hundred
and fifty dollars. Four courses are offered,
as follows: first, general basket making and
wicker furniture; second, making of small
wicker furniture; third, large wicker furniture;
fourth, fine and artistic wicker
working.</p>

<p>In the blacksmiths&#8217; school the instruction
is for two hours, one day each week. Theoretical
work in horseshoeing, and drawing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>related to the course are taught.</p>

<p>The city and guild support the school for
bookbinders. The students are both apprentices
and journeymen. They work
week day evenings and Sunday mornings.
The purpose is not to produce tradesmen,
but rather to make more proficient those engaged
in some form of bookbinding, and to
this end applicants must have had experience
amounting to two years work before entering
the school. All students must be
grounded in the general elements underlying
the trade before they are allowed to
take up any phase as a specialty. No fee is
charged the apprentices of guild members;
others pay five marks per term; journeymen
pay nine marks per term.</p>

<p>In the cabinetmakers&#8217; school, all lines of
work pertaining to the trade are taken up,
drawing and designing for trade purposes;
free-hand drawing; modeling, carving; properties
of woods, etc. Instruction is given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>week day evenings and Sunday forenoons.
Four marks are charged for the first term in
the drawing course and for each subsequent
term, two marks. The subjects taken up
are: chemistry, free-hand drawing, projection,
trade drawing, perspective and
shadows, drawing from cast, modeling and
wood carving, joinery. The school is under
public control.</p>

<p>In most of the remaining trade schools,
instruction is pretty generally given on week
day evenings and Sunday mornings, the
apprentices of guild members paying no fee,
a small charge being made for outsiders.
The support comes from city, state and guild
in most cases. In the school for masons however,
there is a preparatory course and also
a carpenters&#8217; course, the whole covering a
three years term. In this school the instruction
is thorough, covering plans, drawings
and specifications; stone, brick, and
wood construction; foundations, arches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>staircases, roofs, and the like. Almost
without exception in all these schools the
winter attendance is greater than that in the
summer.</p>

<p>Certain individual schools throughout the
Empire deserve special mention, the Royal
Fachschule of Iserlohn, the first in Prussia,
being a notable example. Here handwork
is combined with industrial art adapted to
metal work. Boys who entered the trade
were, in the early days of the school, found
to be in need of both theoretical and practical
work, so each has a place in the curriculum.
The length of the course is three
years, covering the trades of designers, wood
carvers, moulders, founders, turners, chasers,
engravers, gilders, and etchers. Here
are taught drawing in all its branches;
modeling in wax and clay; history of art and
metal work; elements of chemistry and physics;
mathematics; German. Practical
work in the department in which the student
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>is engaged, is given, the student
stating on entrance what subject he desires
to take up. The time of instruction is
from eight to twelve, in the winter season,
and from seven to eleven in the summer.
The afternoon session is from two to six.
In the engineering trade school, three hours
per day are devoted to ornamental drawing,
German, physics and arithmetic. As the
instruction is planned for working people it
is largely theoretical.</p>

<p>The Reimscheid school is of the apprenticeship
order. Attention is given the
making of edge tools and such other implements
as are manufactured in the district.
All students take drawing and design as
applied to iron work. They are made
acquainted with the different kinds of iron
work that can be carried on in the home;
are schooled in the use of the tools made;
learn regarding the markets at which they
are sold, and the various methods of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>manufacture. Thus a general understanding
of the principles underlying his trade is
given the boy and he becomes acquainted
with the commercial side of his calling while
undergoing the necessary preparation in
manipulation. The theoretical work is given
in the morning and what shop practice is
offered is in the afternoon from two to
seven. The tuition is twenty dollars per
year.</p>

<p>The Pottery Trade School at Hohr Grenzhausen,
Prussia, is under State control.
There are day and evening classes, the
former attended for the most part by the
sons of manufacturers; the evening classes
by men and women who are employed
otherwise during the day. There are Sunday
classes also. Decorated stoneware is
given much attention. The day class boys
enter with a fairly good knowledge of drawing
and have perhaps attended the Fortbildungsschule.
Drawing, descriptive geometry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>modeling in clay and wax, new forms
of vessels and original ornamentation, painting,
designing and decorative art, manufacture
of earthenware, lectures and study
of collections, make up the curriculum.
Any original model made becomes the
property of the father of the boy, or of the
person financially supporting such boy during
his attendance at school. Two duplicates
of the model must be left at the school.
The courses are three years, daily sessions,
Saturdays excepted. The fees are nominal,
being only five dollars per year for the day
classes, thirty hours weekly, and one dollar
for evening work, two hours weekly. Pupils
living outside the municipality pay six
dollars per year for day instruction.</p>

<p>The Furtwangen, or Black Forest schools
are made up of several divisions, giving
rather a high class of instruction. Clock
making, wood carving, and straw plaiting,
are largely carried on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>This paper would not be complete without
some mention of the system of apprenticeship
in vogue in Germany. The Lehrwerkst&auml;tten
or apprentice shops play a
considerable part in the industrial life of
the Empire. In some instances they are
maintained in connection with the trade
schools, or again, are semi-private or separate
shops. The apprenticeship shops on
the one hand, and the continuation schools
upon the other, are doing much of the work
formerly undertaken by the trade schools
proper. While manufacturing upon a
larger scale is recognized as possessing advantages
over the smaller productive plants,
it has seemed wise to hold to the handicrafts,
in a measure at least. The apprentice
system helps to preserve the traditions
and sentiments of the German people, by
handing down these handicrafts. The
associations, vereins, and guilds of past
time, are to-day, through the aid of legislation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>coming to the fore, and bringing with
them many boys trained in the shops under
the masters. To show the power and scope of
the guild, and in some cases it is incumbent
upon a community to form a guild whether
or no, let me give the following quotation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Persons carrying on trades on their own
account can form guilds for the advancement
of their common trade interests. The
object of the guild shall be:</p>

<p>1. the cultivation of an esprit de corps
and professional pride among the members
of a trade;</p>

<p>2. the maintenance of amicable relations
between employers and their employes, and
the securing of work for unemployed journeymen
and their shelter during the period
of their nonemployment;</p>

<p>3. the detailed regulations of the conditions
of apprenticeship and the care for
the technical and moral education of apprentices;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>4. the adjustment of disputes between
guild members and their apprentices, as
contemplated by the law of July 20, 1890,
concerning industrial arbitration.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shops offer about the same lines of
work as do the private concerns, aiming
however to be more systematic and to cover
a wider scope. It is asserted by some that
the instruction gained in the shop is superficial,
and not to be compared with that obtained
from the traveling master-workmen.
When the shop is connected with some enterprise
or manufacturing interest, a master-workman
has one apprentice only under his
charge, for which he receives from the state
some thirty-five dollars yearly, the boy being
given board, lodging and proper training.
The master must have attained the age of
twenty-four years, and must fulfil certain
technical qualifications. The instruction is
practical in the highest degree and thus
follows the lead of the trade schools in letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>and spirit. The fees are mainly paid in by
guild members, and those not members
even, provided such reside in the district
and are connected with the trade for which
the school stands. Local and state aid is
furnished. While the period of apprenticeship
may extend over four years, three years
is the usual term.</p>

<p>The various types of institutions taken up
under this head are of an intermediate grade,
standing half way between the trade school
on the one hand and the higher technical
institutions upon the other. Indeed, they
contain many elements in common with the
lower group, their scope however being
broader and more general or indirect, theoretical
work finding a place in their curricula.
Owing to a similarity in the instruction
given, several classes of schools seem to
demand a hearing under this section. We
shall begin with the more general trade
schools omitted from our previous study.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Schools for the Building Trades</span><br />

(Baugewerkschulen)</h3>

<p>The schools for the building trades, of
which there are a half hundred in the Empire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>are very similar in character throughout.
The Munich school, established in
1823, was the first of its kind. Their aim,
as indicated in the title, is the giving of
training in the trades connected with the
various building operations. The majority
of these schools offer a course two years in
length. The age of admission is fourteen to
sixteen years. It is a requisite under some
boards, that applicants have had practical
experience in the line to be followed, at
least two half-years and in some cases two
full years, before entrance to the school.
They must have also a fair general knowledge
of their own language, and of reading
and writing as well. The candidate must
be a graduate of the Volksschule or must
subject himself to an examination. The
fees in these schools vary from fifty to two
hundred marks per year. These are day
sessions only. The governing power is in
some cases vested in the municipality, frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>in the State, and again in private
enterprise.</p>

<p>While those who go out from these schools
may, some of them at least, follow the
trades as regular laborers, others again are
qualified as master-workmen and leaders in
their craft. Construction in wood, stone,
iron and metals; laws of building; modes
of heat, light and ventilation; plumbing;
interior fittings; these and other occupations
are taken up. The sessions of most schools
extend over the winter months only, the
students being actively engaged in their several
trades during the summer season.
These schools holding continuous sessions,
are sparsely attended during the summer.
When theoretical work is given, such subjects
are included as bookkeeping, descriptive
geometry, physics and mechanics, German,
free-hand and mechanical drawing, design,
principles of architecture. The practical programme
comprehends a study of building materials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>and the procuring and working of the
same; relative strengths and adaptability to
purpose; models of construction; ornamentation;
architecture and design; estimates;
chemical properties of materials; supports,
trusses, arches and the like. In the more
advanced institutions, algebra, surveying,
mechanics, study of machines and chemistry
may be added to the theoretical list
given, while the practical studies are more
intensive, and of a somewhat higher order.
Special departments for engineering, (Tiefbauabteilungen)
preparing men to occupy
positions as superintendents, managers of
public works, construction directors, etc.,
are sustained in some instances.</p>

<p>Such schools are of an inferior engineering
type, and deal with problems of advanced
work as related to the construction of roads,
water works and railroads; municipal engineering;
bridge construction; electro-technics.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>The theoretical lines are similar to
those pursued in other courses.</p>

<p>The schools to which we have just referred
illustrate well the statement made in
a previous connection, that the grade of instruction
rather than the character of the
subjects taught, determines the classification
of schools into groups. Three classes of
trade instruction have just been mentioned,
and might well be styled lower,
middle and upper schools for trade teaching.
Another point of interest lies in the fact,
that while we have been speaking of theoretical
and practical subjects as forming the
curricula of the schools for the building
trades, the distinction should rather be
drawn on the line of traditional book subjects
and applied or laboratory practice.
Practical work, per se, is not carried on in
the school. Thus we have a close connection
between theory and practice; more
closely perhaps than is found to exist in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>other trades.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Schools for Foremen</span><br />

(Werkmeisterschulen)</h3>

<p>The Werkmeisterschulen or schools for
foremen, are quite prominent in the scheme
of secondary instruction. The courses
given in these schools are of a general character,
for the most part practical, and the
institution, as the name implies, fits men to
occupy positions as foremen and overseers.
Machine construction is the chief industry
for which these schools train. The first
school of this character was opened in 1855
at Chemnitz, Saxony. There are at present
twenty-one schools of this class in the Empire.
Sixteen is the regular age of admission.
Candidates must have an elementary
education on presenting themselves. Two
years is the average length of course, including
both winter and summer terms. A requisite
for admission also is practical experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>in the trade, hence little other than
theoretical instruction is given.</p>

<p>To the objection made by some, to extending
the course over two years of residence
and of including the elementary
branches in the curriculum (such opposition
favoring a reduction in time given to preparation)
the answer comes that the school
should give a well grounded education, such
as will fit the participant for all the functions
of his social and industrial life. Fifty to
sixty marks is charged yearly for tuition
fees. Certain of these schools have both
evening and Sunday classes, the tuition being
twenty marks yearly for week day evenings,
eight to nine forty-five, and Sundays,
eight to ten in the forenoon.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span><span class="smcap">Schools for the Textile Trades</span></h3>

<p>One of the most interesting groups of
trade schools are those for the promotion of
the textile industry in its various aspects,
there existing at the present time no less
than seventy-nine such institutions. The
fourfold classification of these schools which
follow, seems to be in accordance with the
spirit of the work attempted.</p>

<p>First; the superior weaving school (H&ouml;here
Webschulen).</p>

<p>Second; the secondary weaving schools
(Webschulen).</p>

<p>Third; the apprentice shops for weaving
and knitting (Webereilehrwerkst&auml;tten).</p>

<p>Fourth; instruction by traveling or itinerant
masters. (Wanderlehrer)</p>

<p>Not only does Germany rank high in the
character of her textile schools, but instruction
is exceedingly wide spread. Then
again all lines of the industry are taken up,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>from the most elementary to the most technical
processes known. It will thus be
seen that men are trained for the lower as
well as for the higher branches of the art.
In the highest classes of institutions weaving
is almost exclusively carried on. The
general Government assumes the control of
these schools notwithstanding that in the
beginning, many such institutions were put
on foot through the initiative of associations
and guilds. In each of the several
classes the work is both theoretical and
practical. The age of admission is usually
fourteen years and the course of two years
duration.</p>

<p>The Webschulen train, not for specialists
as do the schools just mentioned, but rather
aim to turn out foremen and bosses. The
apprenticeship shops come more closely in
touch with the workmen of small means and
those using hand machinery, while the
Wanderlehrer schools are moveable. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>latter instance, the home becomes the school
when the teacher is present; that is a competent
instructor is employed to travel from
place to place, visiting the small factories or
home manufacturers, and giving such instruction
as he deems wise and necessary.
Much good work is still done in the rural
homes of Germany, and through the means
mentioned the standards are kept up.</p>

<p>The work of these textile schools is
largely specialized, depending upon the
the location of the school. In some localities
wool, in others linen or cotton, or again
in others silk will be given the chief attention.
Both theory and practice have a
place in the school instruction. Work in
the various courses includes a study at first
hand of the materials used, cost of production,
relative values, various processes of
manipulation, chemistry, drawing, designing,
painting, lectures on fabrics, elements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>of weaving and machinery used, and original
design and practical work.</p>

<p>In many instances the weaving schools
have in connection with them departments
for dyeing and finishing. In such cases
much attention is given to color blending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>and harmony and to chemistry as well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gewerbeschulen</span></h3>

<p>Extended mention will not be made of
the Gewerbeschulen, as the point of distinction
between such schools and the Fachschulen
was set forth under the last section.
They partake of the character of trade
schools, but are more general in their tendencies.
While both theoretical and practical
work are given, the former is not
always applied theory, the Gewerbeschulen
being based upon, what we in America speak
of, as the educational side of trade instruction.
These schools are attended by boys
and men fourteen to twenty-four years of
age,&mdash;individuals representing the various
trades. The courses cover a period of three
years. Both State and local moneys go to
the support of these schools.</p>

<p>The Gewerbliche Fachschule of Cologne
is somewhat distinctive. It instructs chiefly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>the sons of tradesmen and superior artisans.
There are three departments in the school:</p>

<p>First&mdash;that of engineering and architectural
drawing.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;modeling department.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;the department of decoration,
housepainting, etc.</p>

<p>The session covers both winter and summer
months, the winter term, as in other
cases, being the better attended. Other
typical Gewerbeschulen are located at Grenzhausen
and at Reimscheid. Applicants for
admission must have prepared in the Volksschule
or elementary school. The programme
comprises the German language, French,
English, literature, plane and descriptive
geometry, physics, chemistry, drawing,
mechanics, machine construction. The
preparation here obtained fits the participants
to enter the higher schools, or to act as
foremen and masters. These schools also
lead up to the industrial schools of Bavaria,
of which we shall now speak.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span><span class="smcap">Industrial Schools of Bavaria</span><br />

(Industrieschulen)</h3>

<p>The industrial schools of the Bavarian
Kingdom stand out as a distinct class of
educational institutions. Here, since 1872,
there has been a clean cut system, presided
over by a Minister of Education. While
the quality and character of the work done
are quite similar to that taken up in the secondary
schools elsewhere, the institutions
are in some respects more exactly defined
and supervision and instruction in the schools
of weaving, woodcarving, basketmaking,
pottery, violin making, etc., is frequently
superior to that in some other locality.</p>

<p>The age of admission is sixteen years, two
years being the usual length of course; the
education of the Real-Schule is a requisite,
or failing this, an examination must be
taken. In 1901-1902 the Munich schools
had an enrollment of 241 students, distributed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>as follows: mechanical engineering 124;
chemical engineering 27; architecture 62;
commercial 28. The graduates are fitted to
occupy positions of trust and prominence in
the various industrial pursuits of the country
and to enter the technical colleges.</p>

<p>The Industrieschulen of Bavaria are four
in number, located at</p>

<ul class="indented">
<li>Augsburg</li>
<li>Kaiserslautern</li>
<li>Munich</li>
<li>Nuremberg</li>
</ul>

<p class="continued">they having been established in 1868. Advanced
courses are offered in mechanical
engineering, chemical engineering, building
construction, and commercial education.
The school at W&uuml;rzburg is of a somewhat
superior order, although secondary in its
tendencies, machinery construction and
electro-technics being given attention.</p>

<p>In the mechanical engineering course the
following subjects are studied:</p>

<ul class="indented">
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>elementary mathematics</li>
<li>descriptive geometry</li>

<li>English</li>
<li>mechanics</li>
<li>machine work</li>
<li>machine construction</li>
<li>mechanical drawing</li>
<li>practical work.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the chemistry course the curriculum
is made up of</p>

<ul class="indented">
<li>mathematics</li>
<li>physics</li>
<li>chemistry</li>
<li>mineralogy</li>
<li>German</li>
<li>French</li>

<li>machine construction</li>
<li>laboratory work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The building construction course offers

<p class="subheader"><span class="smcap">Higher Technical Schools</span><br />

Technische Hochschulen</p>


<p>We have at this point in our study reached
the schools of highest rank offering training
of a technical character, called variously
technical high schools, technical colleges,
or polytechnics, the Technische Hochschulen.
These schools are not high schools in
the sense that the term would be applied to
our American institutions, but are rather
schools of collegiate grade, ranking in fact,
as the title indicates in the university class.
While not exactly comparable to our engineering
schools, they approach more nearly
these than they do any other of our American
educational institutions.</p>

<p>Before the beginning of the century just
closed it was apparent to some German
minds more far seeing than the rest, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>schools of a higher than secondary rank
must be inaugurated to offer training in the
sciences; give opportunity to show the application
of science to the arts; and prepare
young men to grapple with scientific industrial
problems such as were constantly
springing up. Should the university attempt
such work? An effort was made looking
toward this end. It was at once evident
that here was not the place to begin. The
university was an institution in and of itself.
Its methods, curriculum and aim were fixed,
owing to long established customs. It had
a certain work to perform, its own peculiar
function to fulfill, and traditional and classical
tendency were too strong to be checked
in their movement, or to allow a branch
stream to flow in and thus add to or modify
the existing content.</p>

<p>The war for industrial supremacy, between
England and Germany particularly,
was a prominent factor leading up to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>establishment of technical schools in the
latter country. Germany saw the necessity
for heroic action, and her people, anxious to
improve from the standpoint of her industries
at home not only, but that they might
rival and surpass their neighbors across the
&#8220;Silver Streak&#8221; readily took up the cry
for advanced scientific training. This then
was the object of the Technische Hochschulen:<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;They were intended to secure for science
a foothold in the workshop, to assist
with the light of reasoned theory the progress
of arts and industry, till then fettered
by many a prejudice and hindered through
lack of knowledge; on the other hand, they
sought to raise that part of the nation engaged
in industry to such a love of culture
as would secure to it its due measure of
public respect.&#8221;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Note on the earlier History of the Technical High
School in Germany by A.&nbsp;E. Twentyman in Special Reports
on Educational Subjects, London, Vol 9, page 468.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>The dates of the founding of the now existing
Technische Hochschulen vary somewhat,
certain of the schools growing out of
a foundation which at the beginning was of
a low or intermediate grade. Several of the
schools have passed through a period of
transition or reorganization state during the
course of their existence. The institution,
and time of establishment of each are as follows.</p>

<p>In 1799 was instituted in Berlin the Bauakademie,
a State institution whose purpose
was set forth in the royal decree thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;To train in theoretical and practical
knowledge capable surveyors, architects,
civil engineers, and masons, principally for
the King&#8217;s dominions, but foreigners may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>find admittance if no disadvantage accrue
thereby to the King&#8217;s subjects.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later, in 1821, Gewerbeschule came into
existence, and in 1879 the union of these
two formed the Berlin Technische Hochschule
which is located in Charlottenburg,
a suburb of the city. Owing to the high
standards of this institution, it is styled
the K&ouml;nigliche Technische Hochschule.
Since its reorganization the plans of the
other schools of like character have been
modified in accordance with the Berlin
scheme.</p>

<p>The preparation necessary for admission
to the Hochschulen is equivalent to that
demanded by the university proper. The
age of admission probably never drops below
seventeen, the average age being considerably
greater. Men of mature years and of
wide experience and training avail themselves
to the privileges offered. The courses
are from three to four years in length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> &#8220;The new universities thus developed
have the purpose of affording higher instruction
for the technical positions in state and
community service, as well as in industrial
life, and of cultivating sciences and arts
which are intimately connected with the
field of technology (Berlin provisory statute,
1879). They prove themselves equal to
universities in the following points: they
claim for their matriculated students the
same preparatory education required by the
old universities, namely, nine years at a classical
high school; they grant and insist upon
perfect freedom in teaching and learning;
and are under the direction of rectors elected
for one year, instead of having principals
chosen for life as in secondary schools.&#8221;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Report of the United States Commissioner of Education,
1897-1898, page 70.</p></div>

<p>It may be said here that an exception to
the rule of the annual election of the administrative
officers, is furnished in the example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of the Munich school, which retains a
permanent Director as the custom prevailed
in times past.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise qualified, students must
have prepared in the Industrieschule, the
Gymnasium, the Real-Gymnasium or in the
trade or building schools. In lieu of this
an examination is demanded. Twenty-four
is the minimum age of graduation.</p>

<p>In tracing the development of these
schools from unpretentious beginnings to
their present high standards of excellence,
we see that more and more they have become
unified in purpose and similar in curricula.
In the early days too, the qualifications
for admission, their dynamic government,
and educational standards were
lower and more diversified than we find
them to-day. Sustained by the State and
each administered by its board or council,
they are doing a work which cannot be
excelled by the universities themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>The organization of departments of work
offered is approximately the same in all
schools. In Berlin there are six departments:</p>

<ul class="normalindent">
<li>first, general school of applied science;</li>
<li>second, general construction engineering;</li>
<li>third, machine construction;</li>
<li>fourth, naval engineering;</li>
<li>fifth, chemistry and mining engineering;</li>
<li>sixth, architecture.</li>
</ul>

<p>Special attention is given certain subjects
in one or another of these schools; civil or
mechanical engineering, building construction,
industrial chemistry, etc. An agricultural
department is maintained at Munich,
and a forestry department at Carlsruhe.
That a knowledge of the application of electricity
is considered essential in our modern
methods is shown in the fact that all students
in departments of machine construction
engage in the study of electro-technics.</p>

<p>The courses of study are to-day upon more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>of an elective basis than formerly although
even now the results of the work of Nebenius
are clearly seen. The success of the
Hochschulen is due to the efforts of Nebenius
more than to any other one man. His
ideas were worked out at Carlsruhe and in
greater or lesser degree incorporated into all
the schools. It was insisted by him that a
proper foundation must be laid before any
successful special technical training can be
had. Preliminary work must be mastered
and a natural sequence of studies followed.
To this end a fixed graduated course is recommended,
the student to be promoted as
ability may determine. The one course
plan however has been substituted for the
several.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The rivalry existing among the various
schools is in some respects a point to be
commended. Then, too, the idea taking
form in the Hochschulen and being more
fully appreciated by the educationalists of
our own country, that each school should
specialize along some particular line, is
worthy of attention. Energy is saved thereby,
and students may have the advantage of
increased facilities in equipment and instruction.
Many Americans are studying
in these schools, possibly more in Munich
than elsewhere. While thorough in their
treatment of subjects, the practical side of
the work is too much lost sight of in the
theoretical treatment. Testing and applied
work are certainly given considerable attention
however. To quote Dean Victor C.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>Alderson of the Armour Institute, Chicago,
who says in reference to testing:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>&#8220;Professors regard this work as professional practice,
just as doctors, who are professors in medical
schools, have an outside practice. The technical
school allows the professors free use of the laboratories,
but assumes no responsibility for the accuracy
of the results or opinions expressed.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The degree of Doctor of Engineering is
conferred by these institutions, and that
their work has been highly instrumental in
developing the country cannot be doubted,
especially in the line of applied chemistry
in which branch of engineering Germany
leads the nations. How closely the development
of the industries of Germany are
related to the work of the Technische Hochschulen
it is difficult to say, but that these
schools have shown through the accomplishments
of their graduates that high
standards of moral and intellectual training
can be had in other than the traditional
universities, and that as efficient social
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>service can be rendered through the application
of science to the arts and industries
as by means of the languages, cannot be
doubted.</p>

<p class="subheader"><span class="smcap">Schools of Industrial Art or Art
Trade Schools</span></p>


<p>The Kunstgewerbeschulen are schools of
art. The causes leading to their inception
are clearly set forth in a paragraph contained
in the 1902 Report of the United States
Commissioner of Labor. It reads:</p>

<p>&#8220;The international museums of 1851,
1855 and 1862, in England, Austria and
Germany, respectively called attention to
the fact that with all their technical excellence
the industrial products of Germany
possessed few qualities of artistic finish and
design. France showed what could be done
in this direction. Her products easily held
first rank in this respect, her eminence being
the result of centuries of training in this
field. Since Colbert&#8217;s time industrial art education
has been emphasized in the training
of French workmen, and the accumulated
skill and taste due to this training, has left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>its impress on French products. The German
states at once set about to remedy this
weakness in this respect, and since that time
have so persistently established museums
and schools for industrial art training that
now there is no important city in the Empire
which does not possess one or more of
these institutions&#8221;.</p>

<p>Considerable variety exists among the various
types of art schools and even among
those belonging in the same class and separated
as to location we find differences. In
Leipzig, Saxony, for example the Kunstgewerbeschule
aims at the graphic arts
mainly. In Berlin, Dresden, Carlsruhe, and
certain other cities these schools train for
sculptors and painters, and the term &#8220;Akademie&#8221;
is frequently applied to these institutions.
They are in fact, art trade schools
whose main purpose, while yet industrial,
is also the instilling of an artistic feeling
into industrial work. They reach on and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>out from the trade school and up to the institutions
for the teaching of the fine arts.
They are then a middle grade of applied art
schools.</p>

<p>The genesis of the industrial art schools
really lies in the establishment of museums
of industrial art. The museums were an inspiring
and energizing force, for here the
best work could be exhibited and studied.
The municipality and general government
financed the movement for the museums.
Schools sprang up in connection with the
museums and later, independent art schools
were established.</p>

<p>A moderate fee is charged those who pursue
work here, twenty to forty marks yearly.
Candidates must have had practical experience
in the line of work they propose to take
up, and both these schools and the so-called
industrial drawing courses assume a certain
proficiency on the part of the candidates;
a proficiency in general subjects and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>drawing particularly. An examination is
given those who cannot present the desired
credentials. The length of the courses in
these schools is usually three years. The
classes are both day and evening, 8 <small>A.&nbsp;M.</small> to
4 <small>P.&nbsp;M.</small> and from 5 to 10 <small>P.&nbsp;M.</small> In some instances
Sunday sessions are held also.</p>

<p>The courses consist of architectural designing
in wood and metal, metal engraving and
chasing, modeling, steel engraving and etching,
design for fabrics, pattern designing,
artistic embroidery, decorative painting,
enamel painting, designing and painting figures
and plants. The work throughout is
both theoretical and practical in its nature,
the instruction gained in the class being applied
in the shop. The subjects of instruction
and time devoted to each differ according
to the course pursued. As an example
of the programme offered, the following,

<p>The Bauschule are only for those who
wish proficiency in architectural studies.</p>

<p>What the Industrial Hall at Carlsruhe,
the Industrial Art Museum at Berlin, and
the National Museum at Munich are to the
art schools proper, the open drawing halls
are to the industrial drawing courses. Here,
as in the museums, are kept models and designs
of rare merit and students may pursue
work under competent instruction. Such
halls are established in Bavaria, Hesse,
Prussia, Saxony and Wurttemberg.</p>

<p>In these art courses skill and originality
are aimed at equally. The relation existing
between the art work and the trade or industry
with which it is connected is such as
to make more valuable the latter.</p>

<p>It is needless to speak further of the museums.
The art products there exhibited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>give much incentive to students, as well as
a feeling for the best from the standpoint
of the beautiful and artistic, and all who
visit them are consciously or unconsciously
influenced for the better.</p>

of industrial art schools throughout the
various States.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
