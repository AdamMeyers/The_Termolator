It was so favourably received by all, that I have been
induced to extend my enquiries and so render the

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>


<p class="noind">Cremation of the dead is neither new in theory nor
in practice. In the England of modern times, however,
the question has only recently assumed recognised
importance. And the more one considers cremation,
the more one finds himself wondering how
it has come to pass that we practise burial, with its
many faults, and do not burn our dead. Thousands
amongst us are now beginning to feel thankful that
the dead are soon to 'rule our spirits from their urns'
in a realistic and not alone in a poetical sense. They
think there is something majestic and even pleasurable
in the idea that it will ere long be possible, on all
civilised shores, to leave their mother earth, not with
a partial, but with a fully consummated sacrifice upon
her altar, bidding her adieu none the worse, but rather
the better, for their sojourn with her. They groan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and labour under the burden of enforced burial, and
'hail with satisfaction and joy the prospect that a chariot
of fire may receive them instead of the cold and darksome
grave.'</p>

<p>The scheme has met with some enemies, and injudicious
promoters of the system have not proved
the least of them. The idea that it was sought to make
it compulsory, was an unfortunate utterance. The
notion of producing illuminating gas for general purposes
from the combustion of the bodies was another
mischievous idea.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Equally so was the proposal for
the erection of a tall shaft in the cemetery grounds,
where the gases could be seen consuming&mdash;something
after the fashion, I suppose, of the twelfth century's
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lanternes des morts</i>. The publication of crude and
undigested fancies does more harm than good to the
subject they are meant to benefit.</p>

<p>It has been urged that the practice of burning
the dead had its origin in a heathen religion, but it is
not wise to accept the imputation. Let us take Greece
for an example. All historians inform us that the
people of ancient Greece practised inhumation. But
when they did practise cremation, they nowhere
associated the burning of the dead with the worship
of the gods. And we are at liberty to argue from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
this fact that neither did the aboriginal peoples from
whom they derived it, regard it as an act with which
religion had aught to do, the story of Odin notwithstanding.
And the reason why the Greeks did not
practise it earlier, was doubtless simply because the
bulk of the colonists came from countries where
another system prevailed. Cecrops and Danaus, who
were instrumental in colonising Athens and Argos,
were Egyptians, and Cadmus, the founder of Thebes
in Bœotia, was a Phœnician.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Neither of these nations
burnt their dead, but practised another system of burial.</p>

<p>There can, I think, be little doubt that the burning
of the dead was originally resorted to upon sanitary
grounds, and as a means of protecting the living from
the effects of corruption. Putridity was observed to
be loathsome and dangerous, and it was found that
the practice of burning, and that only, at once resolved
the body into its first elements. In Scandinavia, the
dead were disposed of by fire from the earliest recorded
times, and the great antiquity of the custom
amongst the Celtæ, Sarmatians, and neighbouring
nations, has never been doubted.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It was practised
in our islands also in pre-historic times.</p>

<p>Cremation was the prevailing custom from remote
ages in Scythia, or what is now called Tartary, and
we are free to believe that its origin was similarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
a hygienic one. The Scythians were the progenitors
of the Thracians, and we read that these latter observed
incineration from the earliest date.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The Thracians
in their turn introduced the practice amongst the
Greeks, although it is possible that a portion of the
Hellenes learnt it from the Phrygians, who again
very probably obtained it from India. The Greeks,
too, evidently adopted it from motives of sanitary
reform; at all events, there was no religious question
involved in it. About 1500 <small>B.C.</small>, the Greeks invariably
buried their dead;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> they had not learnt the valuable
lesson. They do not seem to have burned them
either in the ninth century before Christ, for the
Institutes of Lycurgus specify the manner in which
burial was to be performed. In the time of Socrates,
however, 500 <small>B.C.</small>, cremation appears to have become
optional, for Plato makes Socrates say that he did
not care whether he was burned or buried. It was,
however, common enough about 100 <small>B.C.</small>; I myself have
dug up on the site of Dardanus relics of this kind of
sepulture. Time rolled on, and in their turn the
Romans, who also originally inhumed,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> borrowed the
salutary practice, performing it first inside the city,
and then extramurally. It did not become general
in Rome, however, until towards the close of the
Republic. Towards the end of the fourth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
it became much neglected, and finally the Christians,
inimical to the practice, although it was nowhere
forbidden in the New Testament, made haste to abolish
it in Europe. Burial and burning appear to have been
practised contemporaneously for some little time, on
our own Yorkshire wolds for example,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> but ultimately
the former triumphed.</p>

<p>I have said that the process of burning the dead
is nowhere specially forbidden in the New Testament,
and neither is it in the older Scriptures. Moses
nowhere legislates against it, and it is reasonable to
suppose that he must have heard of it, having been a
considerable traveller. The early Jews are said to
have objected to burning because they held the idea
that the soul holds more or less intercourse with the
body for a year after death. That the ancient race
held this notion is corroborated by the 'dwelling
among tombs and enquiring of spirits.'<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The Hebrews
were also said to have interred in caves or tombs&mdash;from
Abraham down to Joseph of Arimathea&mdash;from
a fear of premature interment, since the sun was not
allowed to go down twice upon the unburied dead.
It is more reasonable to suppose that the motive of
public health was the correct one. Possibly they
might have burned their dead also&mdash;as in nearly all
originally well-wooded countries&mdash;if they had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
possessed of fuel.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This was a drawback, and from
what I have seen of Palestine, I doubt whether at
any time sufficient fuel could have been found for
everyday use in this way. When visited by a pestilence,
however, the Rabbis admit that fires were kept
burning in the valley of Tophet to consume the dead.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
This was apparently a universal custom. When Homer
hinted that the frequency of the kindling of the funeral
pyres was owing to the contagion sent by Apollo, he
alluded to the practice.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And without doubt cremation
was the proper treatment at such times, and would
spare the horrid sights witnessed when large common
graves are dug. Interments of this class are never
free from danger. Instances are known where these
communal graves have been opened up and the disease
of the dead sufferers once more let loose upon the
living.</p>

<p>Fortunately for sanitary science, cases are upon
record where a disturbance of the interred victims of
infectious epidemics has been followed by a fresh outbreak,
and thus we are fairly warned of the danger. In
1828, Professor Bianchi explained how the dire reappearance
of the plague at Modena was due to an
excavation made in some ground where, 300 years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
previously, the victims of the plague had been interred.
At Eyam, in Derbyshire, remarks Mr. Cooper,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the
digging up of the plague burial-grounds caused an immediate
outbreak of disease. Mr. Cooper also describes
how the excavations made for sewers in the
site where the victims of the plague of 1665 were
buried, enhanced the virulence of the cholera which
visited London during the year 1854. Mr. Simon
had previously warned the authorities of what would
result from any disturbance of the spot.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Dr. Playfair
also declares that the fever prevalent in Rome is due
to the exhalations from the soil, which is saturated
with organic matter.</p>

<p>In 1843, when the parish church of Minchinhampton
was rebuilding, the soil of the burial-ground,
or what was superfluous, was disposed of for manure,
and deposited in many of the neighbouring gardens.
The result was that the town was nearly decimated.
I have lately made personal inquiries upon the
spot, and find that the mischief which resulted has
been even understated. The outbreak of the plague in
Egypt in 1823 has also been traced to the opening of
a disused burial-ground at Kelioub, fourteen miles from
Cairo. Two thousand perished in the village, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Cairo suffered fearful mortality. The outbreak of plague
from this cause is also vouched for by M. Pariset,
who was sent to Egypt by the French Government to
inquire into the cause of the plague. Even the exhalations
of a single corpse buried twelve years have been
known to engender a dangerous disease in a whole
convent.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>I think it may be accepted as proven that the
burning of the dead was of purely sanitary origin,
and that it is erroneous to consider it a religious one.
It became identified with heathen worship, because
then everything was heathen. In Italy, the Abbé
Bucellati, of Pavia, deprecates the idea that cremation
can in any way be considered heretical; at the most,
says he, it can only be called a rash project. The
Rev. Mr. Long, of Zurich, for his part, insists that
religion has no title to mix itself up with the question.
The subject is essentially one of health, and will so
remain. We may almost say that so prominently
did the practice bring forth the idea of purification
in the minds of its original observers, that several
semi-religious mystifications were born of it. Thus
the body was supposed by some to be unclean
after the soul had left it, and that fire alone could
purify it. Others held that by burning the body the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
soul was finally loosed from the clay, and cleansed
from the contaminations which it contracted in the
flesh.</p>

<p>In order to arrive at a correct idea of all the modes
of sepulture followed out in this country since the
islands were first populated, it would be necessary to
consult almost an endless variety of archæological,
ethnological, and anthropological works. Professor
Rolleston has, however, lately reprinted a paper of his,
upon the methods of 'Sepulture observable in late
Romano-British and early Anglo-Saxon times, in this
country,' and it deals with as much of the question as
answers the present purpose. He shows that burning
of the dead was not resorted to by the early Christians
of England, and he quotes Mr. Kemble to the effect
that all Anglo-Saxon burials without cremation in
England are Christian. This says nothing for or
against the desirability of the reintroduction of
cremation amongst us. The question, however, is a
curious and interesting one, and all would doubtless
wish to know whether or not the examples of
cremation already recorded from fifteen counties in
England are all heathen. When some of the
graves were opened they were found to contain
fragments of charcoal, but that again must not be
necessarily taken as an evidence of cremation. It
was but the other day that a wooden bowl full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
charcoal was found in the tomb of Leonardo da Vinci.
In the middle ages it was common to place a vessel
full of ashes on the pillow of a dying Christian and to
bury it with him; and the practices would seem
identical. The reason for finding 'shards, flints, and
pebbles' in the later and possibly Christian graves has
also led to some curious discussion. It is inferred
that it was probably allowed in earlier Christian times,
and only discarded about the time of Shakespeare.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The whole controversy must be left in the hands
of those who, like Professor Rolleston, are prosecuting
researches into the early methods of burial, and who
have opportunities and attainments for coming to a
right and final conclusion.</p>

<p>It would be supremely foolish to object to the
burning of the dead on the score of its being completely
a heathen practice, and as if burial in the ground
was not at one time open to the same objection. Not
only so, but the battle between torch and spade was
fought out in early times as now.</p>

<p>A writer of the second century admits that many
of the Gentiles disapproved of cremation on the score
of the cruelty which it did to the body, which did
not deserve such penal treatment.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This is exactly
what some are declaring now. An exclamation
is even to be found in an old Greek poet asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Prometheus to take back the fire which he had
procured them.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Just as now a few Christians are
contesting the propriety of burning the dead upon any
consideration whatever, so the heathens were disputing
the like question before the advent of Christianity.
Heraclitus advocated burning&mdash;Thales and Hippon
burial. Up to this day the Persian fire-worshippers
will have naught to do with cremation because they
regard it as a profanation of their deity. Nay, peoples
are still disputing in countries which are painted
in pagan black upon our missionary maps, and where
Christians as yet have no footing. In Japan, the Shinto
sect practises burial, the Monto sect cremation.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In
Madras Presidency the votaries of Vishnu are burned,
and those of Siva are buried in the common way.
Amongst the hill tribes of North Aracan one tribe
buries its dead in graves dug in the villages, the
adjacent one burns its dead after the fashion of the
neighbouring Burmese.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> And to quote one more
example, some tribes of the Miau-Tsi&mdash;who are all of
them zealous Buddhists&mdash;burn their dead, whilst others
do not.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>People are every now and then solemnly informed
that it is unadvisable to practise cremation because it is
supposed to militate against a belief in the resurrection.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>But the ancient Romans, as has been explained by
his Grace the Bishop of Manchester, believed in the
immortality of the soul, which is a collateral idea, and
<em>they</em> practised the burning of the dead. They did not
believe in the resurrection of their present bodies, it is
true, neither do many now.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The truth, on examination,
however, appears to be that the early Christians
objected to it because it was practised by the pagans,
and because it was necessary to draw a strong barrier
line between the two faiths. The ostensible objection
which they found to burning was that their bodies had
been redeemed and renewed in God's image. They
taught that it was unlawful to burn the dead, because
the penalty of fire had been remitted. The body was
to be buried, and was thus held to be in readiness for
the last trump. They did not believe that it was impossible
to raise up the martyrs which were even then
burnt, but they were not to burn. The breach
between the two faiths was not at first an utter one,
however. The Christians interred in the same places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
as the heathens, and even painted and engraved upon
the catacombs representations of the heathen gods and
goddesses.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The breach, however, widened, and then
came the more Christian emblems of wreaths of
flowers, angels, and children. Later on in succession
came the Good Shepherd, the cross, the crucifixion
scene, and so on,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> gradually leading up to the skull
and cross-bones of the last century. By this time the
Christians heard of burning with horror. But a
classical reaction set in about the time of Pope and
Dryden, and now again may be seen in every churchyard
the broken shaft, the inverted torches, and other
emblems. It would also be fairly impossible to count
the number of marble urns which 'in pride of place'
rest upon the monuments in our cemeteries.</p>

<p>Many other groundless objections have been imported
into the cremation question. For instance, some
demur to burning because the body of our Saviour
was not so treated. Can anything be more puerile
than this when once it is examined? Our Saviour's
body was not burnt simply because <span class="smcap">He</span> was a Jew, and
the Jews practised burial in sepulchres. <span class="smcap">He</span> performed
several of <span class="smcap">His</span> greatest miracles owing to this very
practice. But if we are to follow the prototype so
closely, why do we practise burial in the earth? And
why do we not lay our dead in roomy sepulchres?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
I have perused most, if not all, of the religious objections
which have been urged against cremation, and
I humbly say that they appear to me to be outside the
pale of argument altogether. They rank only as very
respectable crotchets, and never rise above mere sentiment.
The truth is, that the question of burying the
dead or of burning them ought never to have been made,
if ever it has seriously been made, a religious question.
As professing Christians we should take the advice
of a late writer, and take care that the burning of the
dead does not fall into altogether infidel hands, and
so become at last a symbol of irreligion.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It would
be wise also to commence adding to the Hymnals<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
compositions which would suit the new and more
rational order of things, and so prepare the weaker
brethren for what one cannot help calling the inevitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Cremation has been objected to<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> on the score of
its being an indecent mode of disposal of our dead, but
I for one differ from this view entirely. Anyone who
resides on a main road leading to a large metropolitan
cemetery, will be able to speak with certainty as
to the indecency of very much which they witness
appertaining to the present mode of sepulture. And
how anyone can be found to uphold against all argument
the present unfeeling shams of paid mourners
with 'wands, batons, feathers, and fooleries,' indulged
in simply from custom's sake and a dread of what the
world would say if the 'conventional costumes and
mock expressions of woe' were omitted, I cannot
imagine. The funerals of the rich are always conducted
with decorum, but those of the poor are often
hideously the reverse of this, and tend, I am sure, more
than anything to blunt the finer feelings of our nature.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion to notice in the proper
place the proposed procedure in the new order of
things, but may here remark that when cremation has
once taken place, shorn of no religious rite, the ashes
may be placed in urns or interred in ground duly set
apart for the purpose, and surrounding the machinery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
for incineration. Or they may be removed to distant
and loved churchyards without fear of evil effects
following. I think that the likeliest place for the
reception of the relics would be the vaults of our
churches, where they could be taken charge of by the
ministers of religion. Once in charge of appointed
persons, no unseemly litigation could take place as to
the possession of them. In Siam the ashes are sometimes
buried in the grounds surrounding the temples,
and a small pyramidal mound erected over them.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
There could be no objection to treat them so here,
but if urned they could be equally well placed in
a columbarium,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and proper inscriptions put over the
receptacles, as was done on the small stone sarcophagi
of Italy. An English Catholic writes to the effect that
cremation would once more enable us to bury our
dead in the churches,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and the suggestion would commend
itself to many minds. Some such practice is
hinted at in the book of Isaiah. On All Saints' day<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
the vaults could be thrown open for public resort.</p>

<p>In both ancient Greece and Rome the dwelling-house
was made the repository of the funeral urns; at
all events, the practice was carried on for a very long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
period. The Thebans at one time had a law that no
one should build a house without a specific repository
for the dead.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It is possible that private mausoleums
could with due decency be attached to ancestral
mansions in our country,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> but such cases will necessarily
be rare. Even then they should be subjected
to proper supervision. It would most certainly prove
unseemly for the poorer classes to place them, as has
been mooted, in their residences, subject to all the
inconveniences of removal and other easily imagined
drawbacks. Disrespect and irreverence only could
follow such a recommendation. The Theban regulation
just adverted to proves that the heathens, as they
are called, were not to be charged with any lack of
respect to their departed dead. On the contrary, the
most tender sentiments are wound round the practice
of cremation. Hercules is reported to have burnt the
body of Argius, because only in this way could he
return the son to a sorrowing father.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Nay, in some
cases the reverence for the dead became transcendental,
and the rites of cremation were carried to such an extent
that the funeral pile was shapen like an altar, and
bedewed with wine and incense. This, however, was
in the decadence of the nation. Nor was this all, for
sometimes an altar called an <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">acerra</i> was afterwards
built before the sepulchre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>These few remarks upon the cremation of human
bodies have as yet referred only to those which have
succumbed to the ordinary evils of life; but I cannot
forbear recording my conviction that it would be wise
in the stricken field to have recourse to the practice.
During the sittings of the recent International Sanitary
Congress a paper was read by Professor Reclam of
Leipzic, in which he most strongly urged the adoption
of cremation after destructive battles. He described a
new portable burning apparatus capable of reducing
the carcase of a horse to ashes within two hours, and
at a cost of four shillings' worth of fuel. He moreover
declared that the dead, both men and horses, left on
the battlefield of Gravelotte might have been by the
aid of such machinery reduced to 'a harmless heap of
white ashes in four days.' One thing is certain: science,
which invented the mitrailleuse, could easily devise
a proper apparatus.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Combatants who have been slain, or who have
perished through sickness, are buried as haste dictates,
and often imperfectly. I saw, during the war, relics of
the dead protrude from the Sebastopol trenches. The
bodies at Metz were in many cases exhumed by the
Germans and re-interred, because the superficial burial
rendered them dangerous to adjoining tenements, and
a source of contamination to watercourses. At Sedan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the same thing occurred, only in this instance the
dead bodies were consumed with pitch and straw.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Cremation is the only practice which seems commendable
in times of warfare. Numerous dead Saracens
were burnt by the King of Castile. During the
wars between the English and the Burgundians and
the French&mdash;the latter led by Joan of Arc&mdash;the dead
were on one occasion piled up outside the city of Paris,
and consumed in one huge pyre. After the late
battle of Cuenca, the Carlists threw many of their
dead into fires presumably lit for the purpose. Surely
it would be well for sanitation's sake, that the slain
were burnt, as in the olden times, upon days set apart
by arrangement of neutrals. The Genevan and other
Conventions could scarce find nobler work to inaugurate
than this. It would be a wise repetition of
history, should another great war unfortunately break
out, if the combatants would adopt this salutary practice
of 3,000 years ago. With the ancient Athenians,
when soldiers fell in battle it was the custom to collect
them into tents, where they lay for a few days, in order
to ensure recognition. Each tribe then conveyed their
dead in cypress shells to the <i>Ceramicos</i> or place of
public burning; an empty hearse following behind in
memory of the missing. It is not necessary, however,
that the dead should be burned internationally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
During the Trojan war&mdash;and since the discoveries
of Dr. Schliemann we are almost at liberty to
believe in it&mdash;men were sent out from each side to
collect the dead, and the Trojans and allies burnt on
separate pyres. There can be no doubt whatever
that the dead were so treated. I have always considered
that one or more of the huge earth tumuli on
the plains of Troy, which I have frequently visited,
would prove to cover ancient funeral pyres, and this
point was put beyond all dispute by Mr. Frank Calvert
in 1859. He opened up the Hanai-Tepeh tumulus
there, and found an immensity of ashes, corresponding
to what might have been expected after a great
burning of the dead. He came to the conclusion that
this was the site of the funeral pyre raised by the
Trojans after the first truce.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Were cremation practised now-a-days in times of
warfare, and with our improved appliances, there
would be no costly monuments to be kept up by the
invaders, such as we now jealously maintain on
the heights of Sebastopol<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>&mdash;nothing be left behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to recall a strife best forgotten. The ashes of our
warrior dead could even be brought home to lie in
the fatherland. When Nestor recommended the bodies
of the slain Achæans to be burnt close to the ships,
in order that the survivors might be able to carry
home the bones, and raise over them a common
tomb,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> he proved himself much wiser than our generation.</p>

<p>The general adverse feeling to burning even the
dead bodies of animals at the present day, has without
doubt often brought about serious evils. During the
Crimean war the putrefaction of numberless horses
in and around the French camps became ultimately
a serious matter,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and had they been destroyed by
fire no evil effects could have followed. Why were
they not destroyed by fire?&mdash;for fear of offending the
prejudices of their allies? For one reads that in the
battle of Paris, on March 30, 1814, 4,000 horses
which were killed, were burnt twelve days afterwards.
It is doubtful, too, whether or not the removal of
diseased cattle from our midst by burial only, is
sufficient to stamp out a very virulent plague. I find
that during the great plague of 1865, in Great Britain
alone 132,000 cattle were attacked; 17,368 of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
were killed, and 81,368 of which died.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Had a few
hecatombs been slain and burnt at the commencement
of the visitation, or had the initial thousand of
sickly ones been slain and consumed by fire in Russia,
the steppe murrain would have been speedily stamped
out.</p>

<p>In a similar manner should be treated the whole
of the meat seized as unfit for food. In Gloucester,
some years ago, and when the mayor had no power to
fine the vendors of bad butchers' meat, the carcases
were, it is said, destroyed by fire outside the city wall.
Would that such jurisdiction existed now! In the metropolis
alone, thousands of tons of animal food are
yearly condemned, to say nothing of fruit and vegetables.
The State should burn these up with even
more alacrity than contraband of custom. And the
purification by fire might be even extended to the
humblest things. It has been said that the lower
animals which perish in our midst must perforce send
thousands of pounds of mephitic vapour daily into
the air, if left unburnt.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> It is not necessary to
enumerate what else it would be desirable to destroy
in this way. They can be seen in nearly every river,
canal, and pond, in every ditch, gutter, and even
street.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p>Medical men are the chief exponents of the good
results which will follow the adoption of cremation,
and with one exception the whole of the foreign
writers upon the subject are professors of some branch
of medical science. It is the same in our own country.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<h3>METHODS OF TREATING THE DEAD.</h3>


<p class="noind">It will be necessary for my purpose to give a short
description of the chief modes of disposing of the
dead, and to quote a very few examples of each
practice. In instancing such examples, I will as much
as possible confine myself to my note-books of the
last four years, and by so doing the matter will not
only be more likely to possess novelty, but it will
have been based upon the late observations of our
distinguished travellers and possess authenticity.</p>

<p>The first method of disposal which I will mention
is Exposure, which might be better described as no
burial at all. The Colchians and Phrygians at one
time hung the dead bodies upon the limbs of trees,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
and some of the Indians of the Plains of North America
to the present day do little else, since they expose
their dead, after a rude bandaging, upon platforms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
erected upon the top of tall poles. Many ancient
nations, however, purposely exposed their dead to the
predatory instinct of animals. For instance, the Syrcanians
abandoned their dead to wild dogs.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The
ancient Ethiopians threw their dead into the water, to
be devoured by aquatic animals.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The Parsees, as far
back as 400 <small>B.C.</small>, and for an untraced time previously,
exposed their deceased friends upon high gratings
to feed birds of prey, and such 'towers of silence'
are in use up to the present day. Dr. Aveling informs
me that in India they are accustomed to
carry the body to the top of a hill and place it
upon a stone slab, returning for it in order to bury it
when the bones are picked clean. Disturbances have
frequently taken place of late between the Hindoos
and Parsees owing to this practice, for the vultures
and other birds often let fall portions of the body
during their flight into the gardens of the former.
And speaking still of our own times, the Hindoos often
expose their dead by the banks of their sacred river to
the attacks of the river monsters; some of them even,
when fuel is scarce, cast the partly burnt body into
the Hooghly. Some Kaffir tribes also remove the
dead out of sight to spots in the bush, where they
are devoured by wild beasts.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Casting the body into the deep is another form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of exposure, with the reservation that although it is
understood to be in the nature of things that it will
be devoured by the lower animals, this is not the
primary motive. The practice is common with all
maritime nations on the occurrence of deaths out at
sea. Burial in the sea generally has, however, of
late been recommended as a panacea for the ills seen
to be consequent upon inhumation. One writer<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
pictures the 'dead ship' daily departing from the
strand with its lifeless burden, and reverently and
prayerfully committing the bodies to the bosom of
the 'mystic main,' until the time when the sea shall
give up its dead. But there is little to recommend
the practice, even if the idea were not revolting to
a people who exist largely upon fish and crustaceans.
When a flight of locusts was some years ago swept
by a storm into the Bay of Smyrna, many people
there would not feed upon fish for a considerable
time afterwards, and what would the feeling be if
only the dwellers in our littoral towns and villages
followed out burial in the sea? Even the <em>sinking</em>
of the bodies with heavy weights down to the ocean's
depths would be hazardous. The only people who
appear to practise sea-burial are the aborigines of the
Chatham Islands. When a fisherman there departs
this life, they put a baited rod in his hand, and, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
lashing him fast in a boat, send him adrift to sea.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
But I need not further continue the subject,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and
I think that it may be taken for granted, that sea-burial,
or immarment, or immersion, or aquation, or
whatever names the method may be known by, will
never become general. The ancient Lacustrine dwellers
did not practise water-burial, but disposed of their
dead upon <i>terra firma</i>, evidently from motives that
have already been explained.</p>

<p>A method of petrifaction has lately been broached,
and has met with some adherents. Something is to
be produced similar to a relic which I once saw for
sale in Manchester, taken from a guano-bed about
thirty years ago, and which had been interred in the
phosphates about a hundred and fifty years previously.
In a cave in the Bay of Nipea, a number of bodies
were discovered which had been petrified by the
waters of some springs. The latest mode of effecting
this kind of sanitary preservation was practised upon
the body of Mazzini; and the result was, I understand,
very disappointing.</p>

<p>A system of inhumation analogous to that practised
when stone-coffins were in use is now agitating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in Germany.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It is proposed to encrust the subject
over with a cement, and, after placing it in a sarcophagus
of similar artificial material, to pour more of the
same matter in a fluid state around it, so that the dead
would be entombed in a solid matrix of long-enduring
material. But those who are practically acquainted with
the nature of cements, or rather with the impossibility
of resting assured that proper cements would always be
used, will know that it is more than likely that, out of
the 32,000 who are said to die annually per million,
one-half of the bodies would be enveloped in an impoverished
material, which would speedily fall to pieces,
with disastrous results. Dr. Sedgwick has expressed
himself as certain that even plaster of Paris would prove
ineffective in preventing the exhalations from coffins.
Supposing, too, that each of the defunct required a space
of one cubic yard only, where could cemeteries be
obtained which could afford permanently to alienate
32,000 cubic yards of space per million annually?
The scheme carries wildness upon its very face.
Something analogous to this system of burial was the
strange one carried out by the ancient Peruvians. A
late traveller<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> has described some of the Huacas, as the
places were called, and the well-preserved remains of
which are still to be seen. It was a system of piling
up coffins of plaster in pyramid fashion, to such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
extent that one of these pyramidal mounds measures
over 14½ millions of cubic feet. One carefully examined
measured over 3½ millions of cubic feet, and
was one mass of half-mummified bodies. As fast as a
death took place, a chamber of sun-dried material was
prepared upon the mound, and the body laid in it; and
although the material of which the mound was composed
was little else than mud-plaster, these cellular-built
Huacas possessed a wonderful power of resistance
to decay. One of them, in 1854, had occasion during
the war to accommodate a battery of artillery on its
summit.</p>

<p>Many of the ancient peoples buried in caves. The
primeval races frequently used the caverns once inhabited
by the extinct beasts for this purpose.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The
ancient Persians hewed out holes in the mountains
with the same view. The early Arabians also hid
their dead in caves, in order to protect them from wild
beasts. Burial-caves of some ancient Russian peoples
are found along the Borysthenes.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> To this class of
burial might also be said to belong all those tombs
which were built up in chambers with rude pieces of
stone, and whether afterwards heaped over with earth
or not. A tomb of this latter description was
the huge barrow of the Emperor Yung-Lo, with its
extensive megalithic avenue leading to its centre, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
way of which the dead was visited or the tomb
cleansed.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The stone lines on Dartmoor may have
originally belonged to this category. Even at the
present day the Inguishes of the Caucasus bury in
vaults of masonry built above ground, with an aperture
in the west side by which the corpse is introduced,
and which is afterwards filled up with stones.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>We now approach <em>burial in the earth</em>, and the common
practice of the present day. It is not needful,
however, to say much here concerning it, as it will be
treated of in a separate chapter, where its shortcomings
will also be noted. The most persistent practisers of
inhumation<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> are the Chinese. They seem rarely to
have followed any other system of burial. Long
before the Christian era they used coffins, and previous
to committing them to the ground inserted in them gold
and silver valuables. But at that time they did not
form grave-mounds or fence them round with extensive
palisades.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The secret of their attachment to burial in
the earth lies in the fact that they believe that the
body must rest comfortably in the grave, or misfortune
will follow the family.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The Chinese are therefore
particularly anxious about the suitableness of the burial
site, and sometimes a priest is consulted and a fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
interment made. This superstition has considerable
disadvantages, because the dead not being interred in
enclosed spaces, as with us, but at the fancy of the relatives,
it is sometimes impossible to make roadways from
place to place. They oppose tramways and railways
for this reason, and riots with the Franks have already
taken place in consequence. The Chinese never
desecrate the graves of even foreign sailors, and have
been known to inter cast-ashore bodies with the greatest
attention. To wherever they themselves wander,
and whether they die and are buried in California or
in Australia, they are eventually re-interred in the
Flowery Land, in the mortuary erections of the villages
dear to them. It is therefore not uncommon to see
a China-bound vessel from San Francisco well freighted
with the bones of disinterred Celestials. On the hills
in China the graves are often allowed to remain
undisturbed for years, whilst in the low-lying districts
the bones are gathered up as soon as possible.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> There
is no such thing there as a burying-ground or
cemetery.</p>

<p>The treatment of the dead known as embalming
was carried on by the ancient Egyptians from
apparently the remotest times. They believed in the
transmigration of souls, and their return in three
thousand years to the same body; hence the practice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Long before the sumptuous mummy-pits were commenced
by the later races, the system was in full
observance. There have lately been exhibited<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> a bone
necklace and two flint bracelets which were found in a
very rude mummy-pit on the edge of the Plain of
Thebes, and doubtless these represent the distant
antiquity of Egypt. Flint instruments have also been
found in mummy-cases.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The extent of country over
which mummifying must have extended was enormous,
if, as is urged,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> there was any kinship between the red
races of Europe and America and the Egyptians&mdash;who
all practised embalming in some shape or form&mdash;and
as was supposed to be the case from the existence of
pyramid building in all three countries.</p>

<p>Embalming has continued to meet with supporters
in most civilised countries, but little practical result
follows, for the opportunities of practising it are few
and far between. Some literature exists on the subject,
and a few treatises have been published upon it in our
own country, notably one by Surgeon Greenhill in 1705.
Mummifying preparations were, I find, patented by
Orioli in 1859, by Morgan in 1863, by Audigier in
1864, and by Larnandes in 1866. Suggestions for a
partial embalmment were also published in 1860 by
Copping and in 1863 by Spicer. The filling of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
arterial and vascular systems with concentrated solutions
was also proposed by Spear, Scollay, and by two
Parisians, in the year 1867; and yet another patent
was issued in 1868. But we may assume that an
universal system of embalmment is undesirable in our
times. There is no purpose to serve in withholding
from nature her very own. Cases may be imagined in
which the practice would be advisable; but, as a rule,
the earth's surface is required for the living, not for
the dead; and we have, at least here, no underground
caves. Had the Egyptians lived in a damp climate
such as ours, there would have been no embalming.
It is not every country that is suited to the practice.
The people of Etruria were, it is now supposed,
Egyptian in descent, but they were content with
images of mummies only. The failures we ourselves
have met with, and which are to be seen in the
Royal College of Surgeons Museum<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and other places,
are quite sufficient to disenchant anyone. The
Egyptian authorities themselves eventually abolished
the practice.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> What would they have said if they had
lived to see their revered dead and their sacred
animals carted away and sold as a drug, or worse still,
as a manure? Professor Coletti has wisely remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
that when a man passes over to the majority<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> he
should speedily become 'a handful of simple earth
and nothing more.'</p>

<p>There is a system of burial somewhat analogous
to embalming, which consists of drying up the body,
and then interring it. The ancient Peruvians used
to dry their dead in the sun, and inter them in a
sitting posture, bound in cotton cloth, the quantity
of saltpetre in the ground completing the desiccation.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
The Huacas or huge pyramidal burial mounds of these
people, which were so constructed that each added
body, with its funeral accessories, had its own clay-mortar
enclosure, prove also that some rude attempt
at embalmment was practised.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> To the present day
races are discovered which possess some knowledge
of the art. A tribe in South Australia practise
the following system. They place the deceased in a
sitting posture near the top of the hut, and keep up
fires until the body is dry, when they proceed to
bandage it. Eventually they hide it away amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the branches of trees.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> In another remote part of
the world, Japan, the Aino aboriginals, when a chief
dies, lay the body out at the door of the hut, remove
the viscera, and wash it daily in the sun for a whole
year. When completely dried, the remains are put
in a coffin and buried.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> In India beyond the Ganges,
the Looshais also practise a desiccation of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
And the manner in which the body of our noble
traveller Dr. Livingstone was prepared previous to
bringing him home, would seem to point to the
prevalence of such a custom, or to the tradition of
one, amongst the African races.</p>

<p>There remains now only cremation to notice, the
origin of which practice is lost in obscurity. It would
serve little purpose to compile a mere list of the
countries in which it was practised. Sufficient now
to say that nearly all the ancient peoples observed
it, the Chinese and the Jews being notable exceptions
to this rule. The ancient Germans burnt their dead;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
so did the ancient Lithuanians&mdash;placing the ashes in
urns of unburnt clay, and burying them in mounds,
as is proved by an exploration of the great barrows
near Sapolia in Russia.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Over our own islands also,
cremation seems to have been common. Urns are
still unearthed from time to time in England, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
parts of Ireland&mdash;one part of Antrim especially&mdash;the
ground is almost studded with burial sites of this
character. In Scotland, too, many similar remains
have been discovered. In Hindoostan the system is
all but universal, and in Siam, where the ashes are
frequently placed in urns of great value,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> it doubtless
existed from the first peopling of the country. The
people of Pegu and Laos also burn their dead;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and
in Burmah, when a Buddhist priest of rank dies, the
body is embalmed in honey, laid in state for a time,
and then sometimes blown up with gunpowder together
with its hearse.</p>

<p>Scarcely a year passes over our heads without
adding to our list of cremation-practising peoples.
Thus we have lately learnt that amongst the Gāro
Hill tribes of Bengal, the dead are kept for four days
and burnt at midnight within a few yards of their
residences, the ashes being put into a hole in the
ground dug upon the exact spot where the burning
took place, and a small thatched building erected
over the grave, which is afterwards allowed to fall to
pieces.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The Khāsi Hill tribes also practise cremation
of the dead, and the ashes are collected in an urn,
and temporarily buried close by, until it is deemed
proper to remove them to the family depository of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the tribe.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Some of the Aracan tribes of Further
India also burn their dead, leaving at the place of
cremation some packets of rice, a neglect of which
custom is a bar to inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> And not only from
remote Asia do instances of cremation come before
us, but from America, where the practice was little
suspected. Thus the Cocopa Indians there practise
it to the present day, laying the body upon logs
of mezquite wood, burning it, with the effects of the
deceased, and placing the ashes in urns with peculiar
ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The Digger Indians also burn their
dead, the nearest relative collecting the ashes and
mixing with them the gum of a tree. This they
smear on their heads in evident imitation, one would
suppose, of the Israelites when in mourning.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> I could
quote numerous other examples of the practice of
burning the dead, tracing them satisfactorily, I have
reason to think, to sanitary motives. Some of the
systems observed, however, are excessively puzzling;
for instance, the triple treatment of the Singpho people,
who embalm, burn, and bury in rotation. The bodies
are first of all dried in coffins made for the purpose,
whereupon the mummy is burnt, the ashes being deposited
in mounds, which last are eventually covered
over with conical roofs.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Many other strange matters connected with
mortuary observances, incomprehensible I am afraid
at present, would confront the student of burial
customs. Why, for instance, should the Greeks who
burnt their dead place in the tomb vases and other
things esteemed by the deceased?<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and why do we
find the same practice in vogue as far off as Madagascar,
where they do not burn their dead?<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Why
also should the Scythians of old have burnt the body,
and also the chattels of the deceased?<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Why should
the Patagonians of to-day bury the body and burn the
chattels,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and the Shan-doo tribes of Aracan, where
cremation is common, burn neither and bury both?<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Or if these questions are easily answered, why, if not
for sanitary reasons, should any people have gone to
the trouble and expense of cremation, when exposure
or burial in the earth was so easy to perform and
absolutely costless?<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>When the necessity for cremation has once become
a settled conviction with a people, nothing but the
pressure of a conquering race or religion inimical to
the practice will eradicate it. In parts of Madras
where fuel is dear, the body is reduced to ashes with
dried cow-dung and wood. In Siam, if poverty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
forbids immediate cremation, the body is first buried,
and when the cost of the process can be borne, the
body is disinterred and given to the purifying flame.
Rather too than lose the benefits of cremation, when
wood was scarce and when it was forbidden to cast
the partly consumed bodies in the river, the poor
people of Bengal, with, for that race, even avidity,
are closing with the proposal of Sir Cecil Beadon to
erect a Cinerator, and thus departing from their ancient
traditional routine.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Not even the recurring cases of
premature burning, such as that not long ago at
Ramkistopore, can wean the Hindoos from the burning
<i>ghat</i>. They will risk their lives in war time in order
to collect fuel to bury a dead comrade.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> In any
country where cremation is practised, it is only when
there is absolutely no property whatsoever that burning
is omitted. For instance, a Zaisaugh amongst
the Kalmucks, whose property will pay for a proper
offering, can have his dead body burnt, and only the
utterly poor are buried or abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> More than
this, in order to establish apparently a proper regard
for the practice, and preclude any laxity in its observance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a sham burning is carried out by some peoples.
Should, for example, a Khāsi Hill tribe man die whilst
on a distant expedition, and his body not be recoverable,
some cowries or shell money are burnt with the
deceased man's clothes, and the ashes placed in the
family repository.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>There are several spurious kinds, or half-and-half
schemes, of cremation. For instance, the Fresendajians
place their dead in vases of aquafortis.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Caustic
potash and other chemical substances have also been
proposed for placing in the coffin.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> A quasi-burning&mdash;the
burial of the bodies in quicklime&mdash;is also practised
by the Sephardic Jews of Gibraltar and North Africa.
Even recently, the Spanish and Portuguese Jews have
made use of this system at the Mile End cemetery,
London.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> During the Prussian occupation of Chalons,
numbers of typhus-stricken dead were interred in
this material, but the result was unsatisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> At
York can be seen a casting inside which a Roman
lady was so burned, but whether intentionally or not,
it is impossible to say.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<h3>OUR BURIAL LAWS.</h3>


<p class="noind">In order to properly estimate the improved condition
of things during the present day, and under the
present regulations as to burial, it will be necessary
to examine the state in which our graveyards were
found before these new regulations were in force. Let
us take, then, our metropolitan burying-places as they
existed a little more than twenty years ago.</p>

<p>A very good idea of the lamentable want of proper
space for burial in the metropolis in 1843 was furnished
by Mr. Sopwith, who showed by a plan that the extent
of intramural space then provided was just about
half of what it ought to be, even at the standard
of 110 burials per acre. At that time things were in
a most desperate state, the burials at the parochial
yards of St. Mary's-at-Hill, St. George's Burial Ground
in Uxbridge Road, and St. Olave's, Tooley Street,
averaging 1,204 per acre. The grounds belonging to
other religionists were in some cases worse; for the
interments in the Roman Catholic yards at Moorfields
and Dockhead, in the Baptist ground at Woolwich and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in the Congregationalist fields at Stepney, averaged
1,278 per acre. But the parochial burial-grounds of
St. Giles's, St. Pancras, and St. John's Chapel of Ease,
exceeded the last-named figure by 282, and, horrible
to relate in these days&mdash;when we calculate that, to
properly accommodate even 52,000 annual metropolitan
dead with decennially renewed interments, we should
want at least 500 acres&mdash;the burials in the new Bunhill
General Burial Ground reached the astounding figure
of 2,323 per acre.</p>

<p>This was a fearful state of things, it must be
admitted, but it was even exceeded in point of hideousness
by many of the yards of our country towns, and
even of our villages, where one might have supposed
no necessity for overcrowding existed. The reader who
is anxious to examine these revolting details for himself
can see them in the reports of the evidence taken before
the Parliamentary Commissions of 1842, of 1843, and
of 1850. These reports were issued by Lords Carlisle
and Ashley, and by Mr. Edwin Chadwick and Dr.
Southwood Smith, and revealed horrors beyond all
that could have been imagined. Nor were some of
the villages of Switzerland better situated with regard
to accommodation than our own. Read for instance
the condition of the churchyard of Schuls, as described
by Professor Reclam.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<p>Since 1843, however, many of the parochial and
general burial-grounds of the metropolis have been
closed altogether, and the same has been done in
many parts of the country. During the ten years
which elapsed between 1852 and 1862, about 500
Orders in Council were issued, by means of which, says
the great legal authority upon the laws of burial,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
some four thousand old burial-grounds have been
closed or regulated. Regulation generally means the
forbidding of interments in a churchyard which has
been reported against by the Medical Officer of Health,
except in the case of family graves. A London
churchyard has just been regulated in this way.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
During the ten years alluded to, some 400 local burial
boards were constituted. Within that period also
nearly one and a half millions were raised for the use
of the parochial cemeteries by the ratepayers.</p>

<p>Some cemeteries properly so called existed in 1843,
but their area in the metropolitan districts amounted
to only 260 acres, and the annual number of burials
performed amounted to nearly 3,400. Of this number
the burials in the East London, in the City of London
and Tower Hamlets, and in the Kensal Green
Cemeteries, made up over two-thirds. The number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
burials per acre in the East London Cemetery, Mile
End, was 154, in Kensal Green 17, and in Norwood 5.
In 1850 the Board of Health condemned the cemetery
at Brompton, but interments are still carried on there,
with, it must be, anything but satisfactory results
to the houses which surround it. What will it be
twenty years hence, if the interments go on as now?
Several new cemeteries have been opened, it is true,
for instance a magnificent cemetery at Woking. Others
again are being projected for places where interments
have been found difficult to obtain, notably,
one for the south of London. At the present moment
a company is being formed to work a cemetery at
East Ham, two miles nearer to the city than Ilford
cemetery. As the site is upwards of two miles beyond
the metropolitan area, no sanction is required
from the Secretary of State, and yet it is adjacent
to some very populous parishes, whence, as is set
forth, numerous interments may be expected. The
site occupies 115 acres, 45 of which it is purposed to
reserve for burials, the other 70 to be sold in lots for
building purposes. Then again come cemeteries of
ease as they might be called, belonging to parochial
boards whose churchyards are full. To this category
belongs a burial-ground just commencing in a parish
in the Northern suburbs of London, within 500
yards of a reservoir constructed since 1871 at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
cost of 25,000<i>l.</i> The formation is clay, and is easily
drained into the main drainage system, but the fear
is that at some future time the exhalations will
affect the water in the reservoir, especially if it be
uncovered. These two last examples will show how
nearly omission may be made a non-transgression of
a law.</p>

<p>Our burial laws specify that each dead adult shall
be entitled to four superficial yards of earth. Allowing
for the predominant deaths amongst children, this
would be an average of three yards. This thirty-six
superficial feet is about the space allowed to each body
by the authorities of Stuttgart and Munich; but in
Würtemberg fifty-four feet are accorded, and in some
parts of Austria as much as ninety feet is awarded to
each adult. The common practice with us is to allow
about a quarter of an acre of burial-ground to each
1,000 head of population, where the soil is favourable;
but some authorities double this allowance, and leave
room for embellishing the ground. Wise cemetery
companies also allow a space between each alternate
row of grave-spaces, in order to prevent trampling.
They, moreover, encourage the purchase of family
freehold grave-plots containing three or six grave-spaces.
It is true that the proprietors of the burial-ground
profit by this payment in anticipation; but the
benefit accrues largely to the public as well, for it does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
not become necessary to open the same grave should
two members of a family die with but a short interval of
time between. For the rest, a commodious grave-space
presupposes a sufficiency of soil to absorb the gases,
allows the grave to be opened without the earth of the
adjoining one falling into it, dispenses with the shoring
up of the sides with planks, and provides sufficient
space for suitable monuments. As a general rule,
one-sixth of the entire acreage of a cemetery will
also of a necessity be appropriated for roads and
paths, for sites of lodges and chapels, and botanical
groves.</p>

<p>The depth at which burial is practised varies much,
but it is usually from eight to ten feet in soil propitious
to decay. Six feet would suffice, it might be; but, as
the intention is to be able to reopen the graves fourteen
years after the burial of an adult, and eight years
after the burial of a child, a fair maximum depth is
resorted to. When a burial has taken place in an
allotment, the above period of lying fallow can only be
shortened should it be necessary to open the grave to
inter another member of the family. In such a case,
a foot of earth must be interposed.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The law is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
distinct on the point that no one shall be buried in any
unwalled grave within four feet of the ordinary level
of the ground, unless it be a child, and then not less
than three feet of soil shall lie above it.</p>

<p>When the coffin is not laid in contact with the soil,
but entombed in a vault or walled grave, the occupied
space is covered by a stone cemented down, air-tight,
upon a ledge in the wall, and the raising of which is
for ever forbidden. The entombment may also be
made by an air-tight surrounding of concrete. The
best practice of vault burial is to place some charcoal
or disinfectant along with the coffin, so that no foul gas
shall escape should reopening be necessary. When
old vaults underneath churches are reported upon and
found inimical to public health, the churchwardens can
be compelled to remove the contents elsewhere, and
disinfect the vaults, charging the poor-rates with the
expenses. No interment is now allowed under any
new place of worship, except with the authority of the
Secretary of State. During the ten years, too, which
followed the passing of the Burial Acts in 1852, more
than one hundred church vaults in the metropolis were
disinfected and sealed up.</p>

<p>Cemeteries, and not churchyards, are now the
chosen sites for interments. These cemeteries are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
permitted to be located upon any piece of ground,
provided that the usual restrictions are not set at
naught.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> A well-chosen cemetery<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> is one whose soil is
dry, close, and yet porous, permitting the rain and its
accompanying air to reach a reasonable depth, and so
expedite decay. The formation is also well covered
with vegetable mould, which assists in neutralising any
hurtful emanations and encourages the growth of
shrubs. The subsoil is also of such a kind as to
need no underdraining, and such as will prevent the
water lodging in any grave or vault.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> It will also
stand exposed to the north or north-east winds,
which are dry, and which do not hold the putrefactive
gases in solution, like the moist south or south-westerly
winds.</p>

<p>Cemeteries can be made upon clay soils, if properly
drained by deep cross-drains, and by pipe-drains laid
from grave-space to grave-space, duly conducted into
the main drain, or by causing the first interments to
be made near the drain, strewing gravel at the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of each grave opened out, and similarly connecting
with this porous layer each new grave with a previous
one. When the soil does not admit percolation downwards,
it is necessary to get rid of the surface water by
laying a line of pipes at the upper end of each row of
graves, and so intercepting it. Or upright pipes are
placed, reaching down to the bottom of the grave and
to the artificially placed gravel then communicating
with the drain. The clayey soils of some burial-grounds
have also been improved by the admixture of
sand and gravel when refilling the graves. But, even
after all this expense, the gases evolved during decay
are retained very often in the soil, and, after thirty or
more years, little or no change will have been effected.
The laws of nature are thus contravened; for she has
ordained that, in good soil, all but the larger bones
shall disappear in twelve years. If interments be
made in the worst of clays, sudden heat will open up
fissures in the ground with lamentable results.</p>

<p>An improperly chosen graveyard, then, may be
said to be one where the soil is dense and clayey, and
impervious to moisture. It will be insufficiently
drained, necessitating the use of planks to walk upon
in wet weather. It will be too close to the abodes of
the living, too small to permit proper planting, the
graves covered, it may be, with flat stones, which prevent
the passage downwards of the air and rain, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
surrounded, moreover, by high walls which exclude
the fresh air. The ground will be stony and insufficiently
covered with vegetable soil. No natural
outfall will exist, and the drainage-water must be
pumped up, the bare idea of which is horrible. It
will be near also to water-bearing strata, or to
a reservoir. Long before decomposition has taken
place, owing to the smallness of the site and the impossibility
of obtaining any more land except at high
building prices, the organic matter hidden out of sight
will be far too large in proportion to the area. From
the foregoing we may conclude that a proper site for
a cemetery is not everywhere obtainable, and that
serious mistakes must often be made.</p>

<p>The older burial-grounds can be closed at the expiration
of a month's notice given by duly qualified
persons, on the order of the Privy Council, and any
one assisting at a burial contrary to that order is liable
to fine and imprisonment.</p>

<p>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners can grant, in
certain cases, a faculty permitting the erection of
schools in churchyards, especially when the grounds
have been closed under the Burials Act; and never
shall I forget a school of this description in one of our
largest cities. Old burial-grounds can be converted
to more common secular purposes under certain
restrictions, as may be witnessed almost every day in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
London. In such cases the remains must be decorously
removed to some consecrated ground, after
due notice to the relatives. An example of this may
be observed at the present moment at the demolished
church of St. Antholin, London; only in this
case the remains have not been carted away as usual
to the City of London Cemetery at Ilford, but have
been placed in a monster vault constructed at the
base of the tower, which is the only part of the
church that is to remain. In this vault have been
placed over 200 chests, each containing the contents
of a grave.</p>

<p>If the closed burial-ground be taken under the
Land Clauses Act for public improvements, and converted
into sites for building, the freeholder obtains
the sum at which it was valued previously to the
passing of the Act, and the building may proceed.
In the City of London the Commissioners may, with
the Bishop's consent, arrange with the churchwardens
for the appropriation of any disused burial-ground.
Sometimes, as in the case of the Bunhill Fields ground,
the space may be laid out and preserved as an open
space by a corporation, and a burial board may do
the like with all ancient graveyards within their jurisdiction.
The authorities, however, I believe, provide
that, in burial-places so closed, vertical tombstones
shall not be thrown down and made use of as a paving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and, as a general rule, the growth of grass is encouraged
for sanitary purposes.</p>

<p>I have given an account of the past and present
state of the burial laws, because it was necessary to
do so in order to estimate the position which any
better system of dealing with our dead will occupy.
It cannot be said that no pains have been taken to
lessen the horrors of the tomb, for I have taken the
trouble to make a list of the proposed improvements
in the paraphernalia of death which have appeared<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
since 1781, and everything seems to have been considered.
From 1781 to 1825 the main thing studied
was security against the rifling of the grave; and then
on to 1871 followed plans for all kinds of coffins in
stone, marble, granite, slate, porcelain, earthenware,
bitumen, asphalte, paper, peat, india-rubber, iron,
and glass. Glass has been the favourite material,
just as it was in old Italy, where it was mostly
selected to enshrine the ashes collected from the pyre.
It is melancholy to peruse these strivings after the
impossible, and to see what fond but unavailing
attempts have been made to rob inhumation of its
terrors.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<h3>DANGERS OF OUR SYSTEM OF BURIAL.</h3>


<p class="noind">In order to form a comprehensive idea of the salutary
benefits which will accrue from a general observance
of cremation, or even from a limited adoption of the
scheme&mdash;which, by the way, is nowhere forbidden by
the statutes of the land&mdash;it will be necessary to
review cursorily the positive evils for which past
inhumation is answerable. I will therefore attempt
to point out from carefully collected and other
authentic sources, chiefly from the reports of the
Parliamentary Commissioners, how the dead have
poisoned and still poison the living.</p>

<p>It seems to be generally admitted that the fœtid
air exhaled from the dead is fatal if breathed in a
concentrated state, and that, even when dissipated by
the wind, it lowers the vital powers of the community.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Cases of instant death to grave-diggers, notably to
three in Paris in September 1852, from accidentally
inhaling the concentrated miasma which escapes from
coffins, have been recorded. Slower deaths from exposure
to the same evil, through what is designated
low fever, are very common. Undertakers have given
evidence to the effect that they have suffered from
faintness and nausea, even when they have not been
cognisant of any offensive odour.</p>

<p>Dr. Riecke reported that putrid emanations
'operate in two ways, one set of effects being produced
through the lungs by impurity of air from the
mixture of irrespirable gases, the other set through
the olfactory nerves by powerful, penetrating, and
offensive smells.' Dr. Southwood Smith says that,
when present in the atmosphere, morbific animal
matter is 'conveyed into the system through the thin
and delicate walls of the air-vesicles of the lungs in
the act of respiration,' and instances how the vapour
of turpentine, if only inhaled when walking through
a recently painted room, will exhibit 'its effects in
some of the fluid excretions of the body even more
rapidly than if it had been taken into the stomach.'</p>

<p>So with the vapour which arises from an overcrowded
and even from any churchyard. People who
are accustomed to reside near badly regulated graveyards
are mostly unable to detect the serious nuisance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
by the sense of smell; but medical men, accustomed
to the dissecting-room, can recognise it directly, and
can even distinguish it from the foul odours arising
from sewers. In a case at Manchester, where a main
sewer ran through the graveyard, the graves drained
into it, and the smell of the dead came into the houses
through the untrapped sinks. Mr. Roe stated on oath
that he once traced exudation from a churchyard in
St. Pancras parish into the road-sewer thirty feet
distant, and that this would have resulted even if
the sewer had been cemented or concreted over.
These cases will prove that there are more sources
of danger than from surface-emanations. The rule
seems to be that, where the graveyards and roads are
paved, and the stones laid horizontally, the escape of
the deleterious matter is either into the wells or
sewers. If, as in many instances, the surface of the
burial-ground be above that of the street, the loathsome
matter may even be seen trickling down the
walls of enclosure. Some most sickening cases were
published in 1851 in the report issued by the General
Board of Health.</p>

<p>If the formation of a deep sewer will suffice to
drain dry all the wells near its line of march, then
the sinking of a well near a burial-ground must help
to drain the latter. There is a complication when
drains in the neighbourhood of graveyards are tide-locked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
at intervals; and an instance of this was given
by Dr. Reid, who stated that careful examination of
the air in the Houses of Parliament, thirty years ago,
resulted in the discovery that it was very much vitiated,
both by night and by day, from their proximity to
St. Margaret's burial-ground.</p>

<p>The disorders commonly complained of in the
neighbourhood of burial-grounds are headaches,
diarrhœa, and ulcerated sore throats. According to
a report of the French Academy of Medicine, the
putrid emanations of Père-la-Chaise, Montmartre, and
Montparnasse, have caused frightful diseases of the
throat and lungs, to which numbers of both sexes
fall victims every year. 'Thus a dreadful throat
disease which baffles the skill of our most experienced
medical men, and which carries off its victims
in a few hours, is traced to the absorption of vitiated
air into the windpipe, and has been observed to rage
with the greatest violence in those quarters situated
nearest to cemeteries.' An officer once stated to Mr.
Chadwick, that when a building looking over a certain
Liverpool churchyard was used as a barracks, he
and his men always suffered from dysentery. It
was related by Messrs. Houlier and Fernel that, during
the prevalence of the plague in Paris in the beginning
of the eighteenth century, 'the disease lingered
longest in the neighbourhood of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cimetière de</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Trinité</i>, and that there the greatest number had
fallen a sacrifice.' In such desperate plight also were
the houses which abutted upon the churchyard of
St. Innocent, that the vapour was <em>seen</em> to rise from
the soil, and the stench was unbearable. It is on
record, too, that, when a large common grave,
fifty feet deep, was dug in the same cemetery in the
following year, candles would not burn in the cellars
of the adjacent houses, and those who only approached
their apertures were immediately seized with alarming
attacks. The walls of the cellars streamed down also
with an offensive moisture. Numerous other instances
might here be quoted.</p>

<p>It was proposed by M. Fourcroy to analyse
the foul gases evolved from bodies which had been
interred in this oversaturated soil; but no grave-digger
would venture to assist in its collection,
because it resulted in almost sudden death if inhaled
in the concentrated form near the body, and even at
a distance, 'when diluted and diffused through the
atmosphere, produced depression of the nervous
system and an entire disorder of its functions.' As
a rule, the grave-diggers there had a cadaverous
appearance and all the other signs of slow poisoning.
M. Patissier also noticed several cases where death
resulted from digging the graves. Doubts have been
expressed as to the baneful effect of putrid emanations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
upon grave-diggers; but, as Mr. Chadwick has observed,
if a number of these men be compared with
a number of men following healthier occupations, it
will be found that the mephitic influences entail a
loss of at least one-third of the natural duration of
life and working ability. As a rule, none but the
healthiest and most robust men choose this trade, and
they drink very freely, in order to overcome the
nervous depression caused by unhealthy emanations,
live on stimulating foods, and work but for a few
hours per day.</p>

<p>Professor Parkes has described and named the
offensive gases and putrid vapours given off by churchyards.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Professor Pettenkofer has also proved the
presence of carbonic acid gas in the ground-air under
houses, and the effects produced by this pulse-lowering
gas. Dr. Reid examined at Manchester some graves
which had been dug some hours previously, and found
that it was necessary to have recourse to mechanical
or chemical ventilation before the men could descend
into them. The carbonic acid gas simply flowed into
these deeply dug graves from the porous surrounding
soil, like so much water. In the same way also this
poisonous gas finds its way into the churches whose
floors are below the level of the churchyards. Professor
Selmi, of Mantua, has lately discovered in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
strata of air which has remained during a time of
calm for a certain period over a cemetery, organisms
which considerably vitiate the air and which are
dangerous to life. This was proved after several examinations.
When the matter in question was injected
under the skin of a pigeon, a typhus-like
ailment was induced, and death ensued on the third
day.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The dangers of inhaling the atmosphere of churches
or chapels under which burial-vaults are made use of
or interments made, have been repeatedly pointed out.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
In other lands besides our own have these dangers
been suspected and detected. The Tuscan Government
requested Signor Piattoli to thoroughly investigate
the subject, and his report has been confirmed
by eminent men of various nations. As having taken
place in our own land, Dr. Copeland mentions the case
of a gentleman who was poisoned by a rush of foul
air from the grated openings on the sides of the church
steps, and who died from a malignant fever in a few
days' time, communicating the same to his wife with a
fatal result. The same fever has been known to seize
pew-openers when cleansing and shaking the mattings
of the floor. After a vault had been opened, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
smell was at times overpowering. It was the opinion
of Mr. Chadwick, after examining some hundreds of
witnesses of all kinds, that entombment in vaults was
a more dangerous practice than interment in the
earth, because of the liability of the coffins to burst.</p>

<p>We may, therefore, for our purpose, assume that,
even under the most favourable circumstances, hurtful
emanations must perforce rise out of burial-grounds,
there being no more natural escape for the gases of
decomposition than by levitation. These gases will
rise to the surface through eight or ten feet of gravel,
just as coal-gas will do, and there is practically no
limit to their power of escape. The danger is always
persistent in the cases of dry and porous soils, exactly
those which are most fitted for cemetery purposes. In
a churchyard at Stuttgart, in which only five hundred
bodies were interred yearly, and not more than one in
each grave, the north-west wind rendered the emanations
from the dead perceptible in houses two hundred
and fifty paces distant. It will thus be seen that the
soil best fitted to ensure decay is exactly the worst one
for neighbouring houses. Unless there can be some
artificial means taken to bring about the slow combustion
of these gases, as, for instance, by layers of charcoal,
the gases must continue to escape in a foul condition.
But who would recommend so extraordinary
a procedure as this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The dangers resulting from improper burial have of
late been intentionally slighted, but there is abundance
of evidence to prove that the air in the neighbourhood
of choked-up graveyards is inimical to public health.
Some sensitive people are even taken ill when walking
past a cemetery.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> I know myself a gentleman who
can detect an unwholesome smell half a mile distant
from a certain cemetery in the N.W. district of
London. It is unfortunate that so little weight is
attached to the report of the last Commissions upon
Interments. The question of the poisoning of the air
in the vicinity of burial-grounds is just now, however,
undergoing a searching investigation at the hands of
the Massachusetts State Board of Health, and an
analysis will be prepared<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> of the answers elicited.
Water believed to be contaminated with cemetery
washings is sought for analysis. Questions are also
asked as to the induction or aggravation of disease in
houses contiguous to cemeteries, and whether the sickness
was attributable to poisoned wells or foul air, or
both. The report will, without doubt, confirm all
that our leading physicians say as to the evils of injudicious
burial. There must be something radically
wrong where fresh meat becomes tainted in a single
night.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>What shall we say of the poisoning of our wells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and water-supplies by too adjacent burial-grounds?
Professor Brande has instanced a case of a well near a
churchyard, the water of which had derived not only
odour, but colour, from the soil, and gave it as his
opinion that the water in all superficial springs near
burial-grounds is simply filtered through accumulated
decomposition. Some wells near a churchyard in
Leicester were disused some time ago because of
a perceptible taint in the water, and, in Versailles,
several wells which were situated below the churchyard
of St. Louis stank so much as to require shutting up.
During the Peninsular War, our troops suffered greatly
from low fevers and dysentery, caused by being obliged
to drink the water from wells which were sunk too
closely to the interred sick. Troops have often been
compelled to change their encampments owing to this
kind of water-poisoning. Cases are on record where
men have been seriously injured by excavating amidst
some water which had drained from graves. In
Paris M. Ducamp, not long ago, discovered a spring
which was entirely derived from the rain which
fell in the cemeteries and from the liquids of decomposition;
and the foolish people, discovering that it
possessed the peculiar sulphur-like taste which is
always concomitant with decaying organic matter, purchased
it as a mineral water!</p>

<p>Dr. Mapother has visited the churchyards of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Irish towns, and has 'generally found them placed
on the highest spot near the most central part, whence
of course all percolations descend into the wells.' One
churchyard he particularly describes 'as lying so low
that the water from the river overflows it in wet
weather, and, notwithstanding this circumstance,
from 30,000 to 40,000 people are supplied from this
river.'<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Instances of water-poisoning have been several
times noticed of late years. The monumental cemetery
of Milan, for example, is situated upon a hill
some 180 yards to the north of the city, and Professors
Parvesi and Rotondi have discovered in the wells of
the Place Garibaldi, the water of which is collected
from the valleys below the cemetery, undoubted traces
of organic matter. Professor Reinhard also relates
that during the murrain some cattle which fell victims
were buried near Dresden at a depth of twelve feet,
but that during the following year the water of a well
some 100 feet distant from the pit gave off a fœtid
odour, and showed the unmistakable presence of
deleterious matter. At even twenty feet distance the
analysis discovered considerable impregnation. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the Prussian occupation of Chalons, the city was
visited by an outbreak of typhus, and to arrest the
progress of the epidemic the dead were massed together
in a corner of the city cemetery and interred,
being first covered over with a quantity of quick-lime.
At the end of some weeks, and after an episode of wet
weather, the drinking water in the neighbourhood was
affected by the influx of matter from the interred
bodies and the lime, as was proved by an analysis made
by M. Robinet.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The latest authenticated case of water-poisoning
from infiltration of this kind is given by Dr. De
Pietra Santa. He confines himself to quoting the
example of the hamlets of Rotondella and Bollita,
the cemeteries of which, placed upon the summit of
a wooded hill, and at a considerable distance from
the houses, have still been the means of carrying
contagion into their midst. At the foot of the hill
upon which the cemetery was perched emerged the
springs destined for the daily use of the inhabitants,
and these being the products of pluvial waters which
had once spread over the surface of the two cemeteries,
the water had filtered through the earth and
become impregnated with the elements of the dead
bodies. This contaminated water eventually produced
a fearful epidemic. Dr. Pappenheim says that, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
organic chemistry had made more progress, if, above
all, the organic matters contained in drinkable waters
were known, springs would be easily found containing
putrefied substances, to the great injury of
those who use the water, and it would be easily
discovered that the evils came from a distant cemetery.
People, however, are now more and more
alive to the danger of subterranean infiltration from
dead matter, and the use of wells in towns and cities
is now nearly unknown. In Paris a law forbids the
sinking of a well within one hundred yards of any
cemetery, but in some cases two hundred yards has
proved an insufficient distance. In parts of Germany,
again, the minimum distance allowed by law is one
hundred yards.</p>

<p>A great many cases could be raked up against the
present mode of burial; but I will not act the part of
a special pleader. One might, however, point out that
instances have occurred in which burial-grounds have
been washed away by the bursting of reservoirs. In
1854, at Herrenlauersitz, upwards of one hundred
bodies, the majority still encoffined, were washed out
of their resting-places by an inundation, and floated
into gardens, harvest-fields, and houses, nor were they
wholly recovered until a fortnight after the calamity.</p>

<p>It would be manifestly unfair to charge against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
proper interment the loose manner in which it is
practised in many parts of the globe. But the evil is so
persistent a one that I cannot refrain. It might be forgiven
to the poor heathens of Eastern Australia to bury
their dead in shallow graves, for there predatory animals
are scarce, and want of civilisation could be pleaded
for them. But how can we overlook the practices in the
Mahomedan cemeteries of Calcutta? I am informed by
a gentleman<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> who was for thirty years Church missionary
there, that these burial-grounds of Islam 'have
long been a crying evil, and the nurses of cholera, fever,
and dysentery.' The bodies are also frequently devoured
by jackals. So, for the matter of that, are the
bodies of the Ainos.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> But then the Ainos are heathens
and the Mahomedans are&mdash;well, people who ought
to know better. They are incorrigible, however, as I
have myself seen. Even in Syria at the present hour
many modern Moslem graves, although lined and
roofed with slabs of basalt, are open and their inmates
exposed.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> But a travelled Osmanli would perhaps retort
and point out that Père-la-Chaise was visited by a
monomaniac who was able nightly to tear up a number
of bodies.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>I will conclude with one more example of the
laxity with which interments are conducted. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
streets of Valparaiso, in Chili, a large and flourishing
city of 75,000 inhabitants, many of whom are British
and French, may be seen the Cerro de la Concepcion, a
hill long since constructed into a cemetery, which is so
saturated with decomposition that it has lately rent
asunder and exposed the city to the foulest of all exhalations.
And what is the consequence? Why, the
coffins and the contents have now frequently to be
submitted to the flames, in the full view of the population.</p>

<h3>PRESENT STATE OF THE CREMATION QUESTION.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></h3>


<p class="noind">It will perhaps prove interesting to consider the
present position of the question in some of the chief
countries of the civilised world.</p>

<p>Italy has been the pioneer of cremation, as far as
arguments and experiments go, although not the first
to reduce it to everyday practice. Here, many
centuries ago, it was seen in all its olden glory.
Italy too was, I believe, the first to put a veto upon
the introduction of the diseased dead into the country
without previously reducing them to ashes, as in the
case of a person who died of yellow fever in America.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The project of cremation was laid before the International
Medical Congress of Florence in 1869 by Professors
Coletti and Castiglioni, and was favourably received
by the whole assembly. The same opinion was arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
at by those who took part in the Congress of Rome in
1871. The Royal Institute of Lombardy (Science and
Letters), in order to encourage the study of the question,
offered the 1877 quinquennial Secco-Comneno prize for
an essay upon the subject which would best meet objections
and which would best illustrate from actual
experiments upon the lower animals that the method
was convenient, speedy, economical, and decent. In
a second manifesto laid before the two Houses of
Parliament, the Institute reiterated its conviction that
the adoption of incineration would prove a new era in
the march of civilisation, and expressed hopes that Italy
would lead the van in the great movement. The
elevated position held by these early advocates of the
system gave a huge impetus to the movement.</p>

<p>Very important papers have been laid not only
before the Royal Institute of Lombardy, but also before
the Academy of Padua, and the Society (Medico-physique)
of Florence. In order to popularise the
practice of cremation, conferences have also been held
at Florence, Milan, Naples, Genoa, and Venice. The
columns of the public press have also been taken due
advantage of, and many interesting articles have appeared
upon the matter. Later on, Professor Maggiorani
made a representation in favour of the scheme
to the Senate. The Chamber of Deputies was also
appealed to to sanction the practice, and Drs. Bono and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Amati convoked a congress at the central city of Milan in
April 1874, when upwards of 500 people interested in
the matter met, and listened to discourses upon the subject
spoken or communicated to them by Drs. Polli,
Pini, Coletti, Musati, Amati, Tarchini-Bonfanti, Sacchi,
and Du Jardin. The conclusion unanimously arrived at
was to appeal to the Italian Parliament to insert in the
new sanitary code an article permitting cremation under
the supervision of the syndics of the commune.
During the sitting Professor Sacchi observed that if the
Italians resorted to cremation they would only be
following the customs of their forefathers, as might be
observed on all sides of them&mdash;a remark which has
proved true to the very letter, for at the present
moment, near the Campo Santo at Bologna, an exhibition
has been opened where may be seen not only
very elegant vases containing ashes, and dug up in
that cemetery, but also skeletons from the same place.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
In no part of Italy perhaps can the relative worth of
cremation and burial be better seen than in Bologna.
Both practices were contemporaneous there about
700 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>The works written in Italy upon cremation are of
considerable importance. In 1857 Professor Coletti
contributed a paper to the Academy of Science and
Letters of Padua,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> in which he strongly recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
cremation. This was followed by an article in 1866 by
Dr. V. Giro, also approving the practice.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> In 1867,
and again in 1870, Dr. Du Jardin called attention to
the many advantages offered by cremation,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> which first
communication was followed by a paper by Dr. P.
Castiglioni, similarly advising its adoption.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Dr. Golfarelli,
previously alluded to, also read a paper before
the conference held at Florence in 1871, of course all
in its favour.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Polli, whose labours on this subject are so well
known, published in 1872 a very interesting memoir
upon cremation.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Dr. G. Pini gave to the world his
sentiments in its favour in 1871,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and again in 1873,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
explaining the various and most likely methods of
procedure. An historical review of the subject was
also issued from the pen of Dr. F. Valerani in 1872.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
Dr. G. B. Ayr eloquently advocated the burning of the
dead in 1872-3,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and again in the latter year the
system was upheld by Dr. Fornari.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>In 1873 Dr. C. Musatti published a very interesting
historical dissertation upon the subject,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and gave his
opinion that at the beginning of the process means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
might easily be taken to ascertain whether the subject
was in a trance. In 1873 Dr. F. Anelli published
an article<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> in which he dealt with some objections
urged by Dr. Rota, in 1872,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> against the burning of the
body, stating it as his own opinion that whilst burial
recalled the middle ages and even the times of barbarism,
cremation represented progress and civilisation.
Much the same view was taken by Dr. O. Giacchi in a
memoir read in Florence in 1873.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Dr. L. Brunetti
also explained the methods of incineration in a
brochure published in 1873,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and in the same year
Professor Amati published a letter,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> in which amongst
other things the economy of cremation was argued.
Several articles followed from the pens of Drs. Peyrani
and Foldi. The most complete work, however, issued
from the Italian press was that of Dr. F. dell' Aqua,
published in 1874.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> A very valuable historical report
of the question has also been recently issued by M.
Biondelli.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The above represent for the most part the chief
writers upon the subject of cremation in Italy.
And, as will be noticed, all, with one notable
exception, were learned professors and doctors. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
only productions inimical to the scheme were the
dissertation of Dr. Rota, which was sentimental to a
degree,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> the brochure of Professor F. Zinno, which
might come under the same category,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and some
utterances upon the subject from clerical points of
view.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The muses were also invoked on both sides,
and poems upon the subject have been published by
Dr. A. Moretti and Professor Polizzi.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>In Switzerland cremation has found an admirable
and indefatigable champion in Dr. Wegman-Ercolani,
whose articles and works<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> upon the subject have excited
the greatest attention. Owing to his exertions
two associations have been founded, at Aran and at
Zurich, and others are in process of organisation, for
the purpose of instilling into the minds of the public
the superior advantages which this method of disposal
of the dead offers over the ordinary mode of burial.
A public meeting held at Zurich in 1874 was attended
by 2,000 persons, and a speech was made then by Dr.
Ercolani, in the course of which the sentimental objections
raised by Professors Blermer and Clœtia were
energetically combated. On the same occasion Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Goll also defended incineration as a sanitary scheme.
The Rev. Pastor Long followed, with some interesting
remarks upon the religious side of the question, one of
them akin to the now celebrated saying of his Grace
the Bishop of Manchester, to the effect that with the
Creator resurrection was as easy from the ashes as from
the dust of a skeleton.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Mr. Long declared the urn to
be a symbol far more poetical than the tomb or the
mausoleum.</p>

<p>Professor Weith, who made a journey to Italy to
consult with the professors there as to the practicability
of several methods of burning, also pronounced in
favour of cremation. Professor Kinkel gave in a
public adhesion to the system, and remarked that to
him burial in the earth seemed a flagrant violation of
the idea of eternal repose. He would rather destroy
the body at once than bury it in cemeteries, and, after
a lapse of time, dig up the skeleton and submit it
to the flames. The meetings in Zurich have been
carefully watched by the neighbouring nations and
warmly approved of, particularly at Milan.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Cremation
will soon be duly established in Switzerland.</p>

<p>The question of cremation has been considerably
agitated in France. A memoir written by Legrand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
d'Aussy,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> in the year V. of the Republic, put very
succinctly the necessity of substituting cremation for
inhumation, and the project was shortly after laid
before the Tribune, Article 5 of which manifesto
left it optional for each family to choose between
the two modes of sepulture.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The Institute of France later on offered a prize
of 1,500 francs for a report upon the scientific side
of the question, and of forty dissertations sent in, the
only fear expressed was concerning the possibly excessive
price of the fuel necessary to a complete
combustion.</p>

<p>Dr. Caffe, to whom I am indebted for several
interesting communications, published in 1856, and
again in 1867, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">résumés</i> upon the whole subject which
are eminently worthy of conservation. He leans to
the idea of the formation of <i>columbaria</i>, similar to
the sepulchral chambers of the Romans, and in his
letter to me he says, 'that the presence of ancestral
urns is calculated to restrain many a one who is
tempted to tread the path of crime and ruin.' M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Bonneau,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Drs. Lapeyrère,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Dechambre,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and Latour,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
have also inserted several valuable articles in their
various journals. Dr. Latour emphatically remarks
also that if the human race had for the last 3,000
years practised, for instance, embalming, there would
not have been to-day a portion of the earth's surface
which was not occupied by a mummy. Dr. Lapeyrère
upholds cremation, citing as a chief reason the dangers
which may result to public health when there are
many thousands of dead soldiers.</p>

<p>Inspector Laveran having called the attention of
the Council of Public Health to the necessity of resorting
to cremation, Intendant-General Robert proceeded
to ask the advice of the Medical Chief of
the Army Staff, but I understand that the result arrived
at was of a very undecided character. The Medical
Chief of the army also called together the two Councils
of Public Health of Paris and Versailles, in order to
take proper steps under the circumstances which immediately
followed the late investment of Paris.
Baron Larrey issued a report upon the general subject,
and laid down the conditions upon which a
cemetery should be chosen under such pressing circumstances.
He recommended interment in deep
pits, and the use of quick-lime, as being a slow kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of cremation and as not offensive to religious and other
feelings.</p>

<p>The most recent document is the report presented
to the Municipal Council of Paris in 1874 by M.
Herold respecting the establishment of a new cemetery
at Méry-sur-Oise. Many interesting passages
are to be found in it, advocating the <em>permissive</em>
practice. The chief French dissertations upon the
question of cremation are, however, those of Dr.
De Pietra Santa, who published them at first in
'l'Union Médicale.' They were afterwards published
with some additions in 1873.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> This last work,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> which
embraces all that previously appeared from his pen,
must be regarded as a complete manual of the subject,
and I am indebted to its pages for much of the
information given in this chapter. He has carefully
traced the modern history of cremation, and has accorded
to Sir Henry Thompson great meed of praise.
He deplores, however, the paucity of sympathy which
the subject has met with in France. The scruples of
some, the open objections of others, and the listlessness
of all, have been only too apparent. The learned
doctor may, however, rest assured that when calmer
times fall upon France, his work will be studied with
the care to which it is entitled, and the commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
which he seeks will be appointed to consider the
question. In less quiet times the question as to the
site of a new cemetery would have been linked with
a query as to the best kind of cinerator. France
will not forget Dr. Santa, and a place will be reserved
for him in the roll of her benefactors. At the present
moment the Prefect of the Seine has addressed a
circular to all the cremation societies in Europe, asking
for information respecting burning of the dead, with an
offer to exchange publications issued upon the subject.</p>

<p>In Belgium no practical results have as yet been
arrived at; still cremation is affirmatively upheld by
very many persons. In a small country like this, where
the cemeteries alone occupy over 18,000 acres, the
useless waste of land alone would in due time insure
the adoption of burning.</p>

<p>The home-produced literature of cremation in
Belgium is small in extent, but reprints of Italian
and other authors are common. The admirable work
of Dr. Polli, for instance, was translated and published
in 1873.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Another translation appeared in the
'Presse Médicale Belge' during the same year. The
'Gazette de Bruxelles' of March 1873 also contained
articles upon the subject.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> During the year 1874, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séance</i> was held at Brussels through the exertions of
M. Adolphe Prins, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avocat</i> of that city, and the
manner in which the subject was received by the
artistic and literary <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> augurs well for the future
of cremation in that country.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>The exhibition of Professor Brunetti's examples of
cremation at the International Exposition of Vienna
gave perhaps the first strong impulse to a study of
this subject in Austria, and the unsatisfactory state of
the cemeteries in Vienna has convinced a great number
of the desirability of resorting to cremation. In
February 1874 the Municipal Council of Vienna
unanimously passed a proposition to the effect that
the superior administration be asked to provide for the
immediate carrying out of the system of cremation,
now that the question of a new cemetery had been
mooted. One of the council, M. Geissler, was mainly
instrumental in bringing forward the motion. At the
same time the Imperial Academy of Medicine are making
an appeal to the professors of hygiene and chemistry
in the Empire for a complete report upon the subject.
The cremation committee is formed of five
persons, Drs. Hoser, Gauster, Novak, Haschek, and
Steniger.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>The municipality of Vienna&mdash;the annual mortality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of which place is about 20,000&mdash;acting upon the
advice given by the Board of Health in that city,
has now decided that cremation shall be carried out
by those who prefer it, upon the plan inaugurated at
Leipzig. The cemeteries of Vienna are not only well
filled with dead, but they are unpleasantly near to
the city. A plot of ground has therefore lately been
acquired by the municipality, about five miles from
the centre of the city. This new cemetery was opened
in November 1874, and on the same day the five
Catholic churchyards were closed against all further
interments. With the poor, however, the removal of
the body from the mortuary chamber to the mortuary
building of the district, and then next morning to a
distant cemetery, is a serious matter.</p>

<p>Nothing can apparently look more charming than
a cemetery sparsely dotted with monuments, as, for
instance, the Necropolis at Woking, seen from the
railway station; but they speedily, far too speedily, fill.
The cost of conveying bodies to these distant cemeteries
must also be taken into account. In Vienna, where
the city burial-grounds are 'more than full,' the question
of conveyance to the new cemetery has provoked
a great deal of angry discussion, and has been the means
of bringing into notice several schemes for the transportation
of the bodies to the site of burial. Mr. von
Felbinger, engineer, and Mr. Hubetz, architect, there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
have submitted a scheme of pneumatic burial to the
municipal council. They propose to erect in the city
a central temple, from which a subterranean passage
would lead to the cemetery. A line of rails would
be laid down in this passage, and an iron car with
its freight of coffins would be propelled through it by
means of a blast of compressed air. The tubular
passage would be five feet in diameter, and by the
aid of a 150 <small>H.P.</small> engine they would undertake to
convey the car some 15,000 feet in ten minutes. The
funeral ceremony would be performed at the central
chapel, and it would be optional with the mourners
as to witnessing the actual interment at the cemetery
terminus. The temple would be built with three
distinct compartments, so to speak; one for the accommodation
of the Roman Catholics, one for Protestants,
and one for the use of the Jews.</p>

<p>The question of burning the dead has therefore
come to the front, and a society called the 'Urne'
has been constituted to realise the idea. Several
meetings have been held, the persons present giving
their most cordial support to the movement. Hitherto
little or no opposition has been met with from clerical
parties.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> It has been stated, moreover, that a donation
of 30,000 florins has been presented to the society
by a wealthy lady, in order to help on the practice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<p>Cremation has met with the greatest enthusiasm in
various parts of Germany, as might have been expected
from so practical a people. The authorities in the town
of Dresden, in Saxony, offered to make it conditionally
legal, provided that its advantages were thoroughly
made manifest by the promoters, which must have been
duly done inasmuch as the <cite>Presse</cite> of Dresden informs the
world that the first corpse was reduced to ashes in the
Whitsuntide of 1874.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> When the ashes were withdrawn,
the funeral ceremony was celebrated in the
usual manner. Several other cremations have also
taken place there.</p>

<p>The best German apparatus for cremation is that
constructed by Professor Reclam and Mr. Friedrich
Siemens, C.E., and was first tested upon the lower
animals on June 2, 1874, in the presence of Drs. Fleck,
Küchenmeister, Roth, and other medical celebrities.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
Mr. Steinmann, of Dresden, also made some improvement
upon the Siemens apparatus as at first
produced.</p>

<p>In Berlin an apparatus is also in course of construction,
and a pamphlet has lately been issued by the
Association for Burning the Dead there, which is intended
to combat any prejudices that may exist against
the adoption of the practice. At a recent meeting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the council representing the Jewish congregations of
Berlin, a motion was brought forward and adopted by
a large majority, to take immediate steps for the introduction
of cremation in one of the Jewish cemeteries.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
The wholesome practice is also being warmly taken up
in other large towns.</p>

<p>The chief works upon the subject which have been
hitherto published in Germany have been those of
Drs. Trusen,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Küchenmeister,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and Reclam.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The last
work is a very complete defence of the system. Mr.
Steinmann has also published a work upon the best
kind of furnace.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>In America the same active propaganda is going
on in favour of incineration of the dead, and the New
York Incremation Society have applied to the Legislature
of that State for an act of incorporation. Amongst
the promoters are to be numbered some of the most
distinguished men in America. The Society accepts
the obligation of burning the bodies of its members,
unless objections are raised by the relatives of the
deceased. A German Society has also been formed in
New York. Both Societies have progressed considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
in point of numbers, and the system of reduction
to be chosen has even been decided upon. The chief
work on the subject hitherto published in America
is that of Professor Frazer,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and must have considerably
enlightened the nation as to the true merits
of cremation. It is not very long since a Persian
gentleman in an Eastern State, who wished to burn the
remains of his dead wife, was personally assaulted by an
ignorant mob and compelled to resort to ordinary
burial.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> But several cases of cremation of human bodies
have been performed in America.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>In England several attempts have been made from
time to time to popularise the idea of burning the dead.
Perhaps the earliest literary production in its favour
was that of Sir Thomas Browne.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Amongst later
productions is one by Dr. J. Jamieson, written entirely
from an historical point of view.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Another
work was issued in 1857 by a 'Member of the
Royal College of Surgeons,'<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> and papers have also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
occasionally been written in various periodicals. Several
articles favourably treating it from the religious side
of the question have also appeared.</p>

<p>The benefits of cremation have been persistently
brought before the authorities of London, and by none
more energetically than Dr. Lord,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> but as a matter of
course nothing could be done, as a suitable means of
cineration was not at hand.</p>

<p>The only practical work which has ever appeared
in England is that of Sir Henry Thompson,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> the first
part of which appeared in the 'Contemporary Review'
of January 1874, and the second part in the March
number. It treats of the question entirely from the
practical side, and it will be impossible to understand
the full merits of cremation without perusing it.
Its appearance has marked a new era in the history of
the question, and the whole of the foreign press are
unanimous in its praise. Indeed nearly every European
nation has now translated it for itself. It has awakened
in our land an interest which cannot possibly subside,
and its arguments have found a willing confirmation
in the minds of thousands of all classes. There
can be no doubt also that the kind of apparatus
chosen by Sir Henry Thompson, after several crucial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
tests, will prove the most suitable one which can be
devised.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>The Cremation Society of London, which is intended
as a parent society with which others in any part of
the land can be affiliated, was founded on January 13,
1874, by some of our most representative men, and
shortly after a declaration<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> was issued to the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
which had the effect of proving to the founders of the
Society how very prevalent and how widely spread
was the antipathy to the present mode of burial. The
aim of the Society is to promote the substitution of
cremation for burial, by diffusing information on the
subject, by co-operating with foreign Societies, and by
raising funds to obtain an apparatus of the most approved
kind, together with a suitable site, so that, for
those who desire the performance of cremation after
death, ample means should be available for the purpose.
The letters of adhesion to the scheme which have
been already received have come from every class of
society, from Peers to the humblest commoners.</p>

<p>Chief in its favour, in point of numbers, after the
general public, come physicians and surgeons, and after
these ministers of religion of all shades, Fellows of Colleges,
officers of the Army and Navy, &amp;c., in about equal
degree. The number of ladies who have joined the
movement is considerable, and some of them have proved
the most active members. The Preliminary Council of
the Society includes names of the highest standing in the
country in Science, Literature, and Art, and the list is
continually being extended. There is every prospect
now of being able to accomplish the object sought by
the promoters. Some preliminary negotiations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
entered into with a large cemetery company, but came
to no practical result, the board of management 'not
being able to lift their eyes to the dignity of the
subject.' Steps are being taken at the present moment
to enlist more contributing members in the Society, and
to enable it, with augmented funds, to purchase a site
for itself whereon to erect a suitable apparatus. Several
donations, one of considerable amount from a well
known philanthropic lady, have been received by the
treasurer.</p>

<h3>CREMATION, ANCIENT AND MODERN.</h3>


<p class="noind">It is not my intention to describe the funeral rites of
the ancient Greeks and Romans &amp;c.,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> because the
practices of some Eastern nations at the present day
somewhat resemble them, and it will consequently be
sufficient to refer to some of these. Moreover, descriptions
of cremation in classic times may be met with in
every encyclopædia. Full details of these ancient forms
of sepulture will also be found in numerous antiquarian
works.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>For a similar reason I will not describe the burning
of the bodies of Williams and Shelley.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The ceremony
was moreover somewhat harrowing owing to the impossibility
of obtaining proper materials for the purpose.
It will be more interesting to the reader to
furnish him with a description of a still later instance of
cremation; I allude to the burning of the body of the
Rajah of Kellapore at Florence in 1873, and I quote
here the description of the affair as given by Dr. Pini
in the <cite>Gazetta di Milano</cite>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At the hour of midnight the mortal remains of the
Indian prince were carried to the banks of the river. The
funereal pile consisted of a heap of wood, about five feet
square, firmly fixed and secured to the ground by seven
bars of iron. A second heap of wood was thrown loosely
around. After certain religious ceremonies, the pile was
powdered with camphor and other aromatic substances, and
the dead rajah was laid upon it. The body was anointed
with pure naphtha, the features covered by a mask of some
greasy substance, and all the limbs covered with resinous
matter, betel-leaves, perfumes, and powdered sandal-wood.
The corpse was then covered with more layers of wood, alternated
with inflammable substances, and the next of kin to
the prince set fire to the pile. Although the flame was
fanned by a strong wind, the body was barely consumed at
seven o'clock the next morning. At ten, when the fire had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
almost entirely burned out, nothing remained but a heap
of ashes. An Indian priest collected a small quantity from
the centre of the heap; the remainder was thrown to the
wind, in the direction of the current of the Arno.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Let us now see how cremation is performed at the
present day among the poor in India.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The Madras
correspondent of the 'Medical Times and Gazette'
thus describes the mode practised in Madras:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The actual process of burning here is simple and effective,
and well suited for people amongst whom fuel is one
of the dearest of the necessaries of life, besides being subject
to a tax, which has been greatly mitigated by the
present governor. A bed is prepared; it is said in the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
books that it should be as long as a man with his arm
extended above his head, a fathom wide, and a space deep;
it is also said that it ought to be on rising ground, so
that the water poured on the ashes may easily run off.
On this bed is laid a layer of wood and 'bratties'&mdash;that
is, cakes of dried cow-dung, which in this country is the
most frequent form of fuel. The body, which is brought
on an open bier, is laid on this, and covered with fresh
layers of wood and bratties. Fire is set to the heap,
which is then covered with a thinnish layer of earth. The
process, which lasts altogether twelve hours or more, is
divisible into two portions:&mdash;First, the fire is allowed to
char and smoulder, out of the free access of air, till all
the heap becomes a glowing red-hot mass, just as in charcoal-burning
or ballast-burning at home. But after the
fire has penetrated the whole heap it is poked up, the air
admitted, and there is a thorough blazing fire, which goes
on burning till all the fuel is turned into ashes, amongst
which are discernible some of the hardest bones&mdash;as the malar,
temporal, and shafts of the long bones&mdash;semi-vitrefied.</p></blockquote>

<p>The above describes a funeral of the poorer kind,
but in a late number of the 'Bombay Times' appears
an interesting account of the burning of the body of
Mr. Veneyekras Juggonath Sunkersett, an eminent
citizen of that city.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The funeral procession from the house of the deceased
was sufficiently large to demand a special report. Not less
than a thousand persons figured therein, 'every family in
the caste having furnished one or two of its male members
to swell the melancholy cortège.' Bareheaded, and dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in white garments, the procession marched slowly on. First
came an array of link-bearers; then, also surrounded by
lighted torches, and borne aloft on the shoulders of six men,
the corpse was carried, preceded by Brahmin priests chanting
a monotonous dirge. Arrived at the burning-ground&mdash;a
spot to which admittance is made difficult&mdash;the body,
lying on a bier, was deposited on the ground, the torch-bearers
forming a circle around. The bier consisted simply
of split bamboo sides and arms, with a rush bottom, and
was subsequently broken to pieces and burnt. The object
of depositing the bier on the ground was to allow all present
to take a last look at the features of their friend and
leader. Many simply salaamed, others knelt and appeared
to pray, while others indulged in tumultuous ululation.</p>

<p>During the time occupied in these last farewells, the
men attached to the burning-ground had been busily employed
in erecting the funeral-pyre; and the corpse was at
length lifted off the bier, and placed on the pile. Officiating
Brahmins then anointed the body with a mixture of
which the principal constituent was ghee. Hard by was
piled a heap of fragrant sandal-wood, split into thin faggots,
and these the relatives of the deceased laid one by
one upon the body, the priests all the while reciting prayers
for the dead.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> This ended, the servitors of the dead-ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
built up the pyre to its proper height with common firewood.
All being ready for the final ceremony, the Brahmins
lit a small fire of sandal-wood, and, having consecrated it,
gave a flaming brand to each of the kinsmen present, whose
duty it was to light the pyre. Then the flames shot up into
the air, a canopy of smoke overhung the spot, and all was
over. The mourners dispersed, and by midnight nothing
remained of our well-known citizen but a handful of white
ashes and a few calcined bones.</p></blockquote>

<p>During the past year the remains of the Hon.
Narayan Wassadeo, a member of the Legislative Council
of Bombay, were solemnly burnt on the burning-ground
at Sonapore, and the ceremony is thus described
in the 'Times of India,' Aug. 6, 1874:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The body was placed, after it was recovered from under
the ruins, on the floor of a large apartment at the rear of
one of the wings of the house; and the female members of
the family, seating themselves around it, gave themselves
up to uncontrollable grief. The unhappy widow was overwhelmed
by the dreadful calamity which had befallen her.
A great number of the leading members of the European
and various native communities called and took a last look
at the remains as they lay covered with a white robe, the
lower part of the face being alone exposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The procession started at about 7 <small>P.M.</small> The bier, composed
of two long pieces of bamboo, with a couple of cross-pieces,
and covered with a rich white shawl, was upheld by
the deceased's eldest brother and three of his most intimate
friends and relatives. The sacred fire, which had been
kindled with due ceremonies at the house, was carried in
front in a brazen vessel by the deceased's son. The funeral was
largely attended, not only by members of his own caste, but
by those of other castes and denominations. When the procession
reached Sonapore the bier was placed on the ground
while the pyre was being constructed. Men with short crowbars
made six holes in the earth, and in each of these was
placed a rough piece of timber about four or five feet high.
The posts, ranged two and two, were about a yard distant
from each other. Three logs about six feet long each were
placed on pieces of wood between each pair of uprights,
so as to allow a free draught under the whole. A number
of smaller logs were placed on these large ones, and were
covered with sandal-wood, which made a sort of bed for
the reception of the body. While this was being done, a
number of torches of sandal-wood were being carefully
ignited by the deceased's son at the sacred fire, which he
had brought with him for the purpose. Prayers were said
while the ignition was in progress. All being ready, the
bier was brought to the side of the pyre, and the body
was divested of all covering, except a cloth around the
loins. It was then lifted on to the pyre, which was by
this time between three and four feet high. The upright
posts confined the body on either side, and prevented the
possibility of its rolling off. Small blocks of sandal-wood,
of various lengths&mdash;from six inches to two feet&mdash;were placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
lightly on the body. The deceased's son then took a brazen
vessel full of water, and carefully sprinkled a circle on the
earth around the funeral pile. He next seized a brand
from the sacred fire, and applied it to some dried leaves,
or similar combustibles, placed under the pyre. That did
not set fire to the pyre, however, and was not intended
to be more than a compliance with the ceremonial; the
brand was red, but not blazing, and a spark or two only
fell from it. The relatives were then, as is usual in such
cases, led away from the pyre by the friends around, so as
to spare their feelings as much as possible. When they
were taken a few yards off, and their backs turned to the
pyre, large logs, similar to those at the base, were placed
over the body, which now became completely concealed&mdash;all
but the feet, which were left exposed either by accident or
design. The friends applied matches to the sandal-wood
brands, and, when they blazed up, set fire to the combustibles.
Owing doubtless to the dampness of the ground,
and occasional drops of rain, it was a matter of some difficulty
to get the mass to burn. Cocoanut oil was thrown on
the wood, and screens were held by men so as to regulate the
draught; and, after a long interval, the pyre blazed up
fiercely. In three hours only a handful of ashes remained
of him who was but that morning the influential leader of
the Hindoo community, full of life and hope.</p></blockquote>

<p>The above two cremations may be regarded as
sumptuous ones, and far above the means of the
common people. With the latter an incomplete burning
was often performed with revolting results. Descriptions
of these failures have frequently been given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
by travellers of more or less veracity. The matter was
lately taken into consideration by the English authorities,
and this has led to the suppression of such imperfect
cremations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By the order of Sir Cecil Beadon a cinerator was erected
at Calcutta for the burning of human bodies; and various
regulations were issued with the view of abolishing the
ancient system of imperfect cremation. The funeral pyre
was not absolutely prohibited within the limits of the city;
but the disgusting custom of throwing partially-consumed
bodies into the river was at once put down. Sir Cecil
Beadon also forcibly suggested that all bodies should be
taken outside of the city, to be burned in some suitable
place set apart and enclosed for the purpose. Against this
excellent proposition a fearful outcry was raised, and the
municipality was induced to confine the suggested improvement
to building the cinerator on the site of the old
burning-ghât, on the banks of the Hooghly. At first the
Hindoos objected to use the cinerator; but, on finding that
it involved no interference with their religious rites or feelings,
they partially acquiesced in its use. The cinerator
built at Calcutta was not quite a success; but the bodies
were consumed to ashes, and the fumes carried away through
a tall chimney or stack.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I am informed by the Sanitary Commissioner of
Madras, that the Cinerator<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> erected by the authorities
is scarcely ever used, but he is of opinion that if the
Siemens principle of a furnace were exhibited before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the educated Hindoos they would very probably
adopt it.</p>

<p>Here is another extract explanatory of the reform
just alluded to.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From the Health Officer's Report to the Bombay Municipality
we find that the cost of fuel for cremation is exceedingly
heavy; and that a body cannot be consumed
under four hours. 'On more than one occasion bodies have
not been totally consumed, the relations having brought too
scanty a supply of firewood.' In this document we also find
a recommendation 'that a cinerator be erected at the
burning-ghât, which would be at the disposal of the poor on
the payment of a small fee. By this means the Hindoo
community would get accustomed to it, and would see its
advantage. A body would be put in at one end of a closed
vessel, which in its transit through the cinerator would be
exposed to intense heat, and after a certain time drawn out
and opened. The ashes of the deceased would alone remain,
which could be carried away and kept.'</p></blockquote>

<p>As it may prove interesting to some reader, I will
now give a description of a cremation ceremony of the
very highest class, as performed in Siam, in which
country, as has been stated elsewhere, only those dead
are buried whose survivors cannot pay the fees of the
priests. It is said to be from the pen of a lady<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
who was a resident for several years in that country,
and is an extract from a paper of hers which appeared
in a late number of 'Lippincott's Magazine.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>Burning is now, and has been for centuries, the universal
custom in Siam&mdash;preferred, it is supposed, because of the
facility it affords for removing the precious dust of the loved
and lost. In old, aristocratic houses I have seen arranged in
the family receptacle massive golden urns, containing the
ashes of eight, ten, or twelve generations of ancestors; and
these are cherished as precious heirlooms, to descend through
the eldest male branch.</p>

<p>The time, expense, and character of a burning depend
mainly on the rank and wealth of the parties, though the
ceremony is always performed by the priests, and always
within the precincts of a temple. The only exception is in
seasons of epidemics or when the land is laid waste by
famine. Among the better classes the dead body is laid
unmutilated, save by the removal of the intestines, in a
coffin, and it is more or less carefully embalmed, according
to the time it is to be kept. If the deceased belonged to a
private family of moderate means, the burning takes place
from four to six days after death; if he was wealthy, but not
high-born, the body may be kept a month, but never longer,
while the remains of a noble lie in state from two to six
months, according to his rank; and for members of the
royal family a still longer period intervenes between the
death and the burning. But, whatever the interval, the
body must lie in state, and the relatives make daily prostrations,
prayers, and offerings during the whole time, beseeching
the departed spirit to return to its disconsolate
friends.</p>

<p>When the time for the funeral has arrived, the body is
laid in a receptacle on the summit of a stately pyramid, the
form and material of which indicate the wealth and position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of the deceased. It is thickly gilded, and the receptacle
lined with plates of solid gold when the body has belonged
to one of royal lineage and well-filled coffers. The last is
quite as essential as the first to a gorgeous Oriental funeral,
since for rank without money an East Indian has ever the
most profound contempt.</p>

<p>Both requisites were fortunately united in the person of
the queen-mother of King Pra-Nang-Klau. At the funeral
of this aged queen there was such a display of Oriental
magnificence as rarely falls to the lot of Western eyes to
witness. The embalmed body lay in state under a golden
canopy for eight months; the myrrh, frankincense, and
aromatic oils used in its preparation cost upwards of one
thousand pounds, and the golden pyre above twenty thousand.
The hangings were of the richest silks and velvets, trimmed
with bullion fringe and costly lace, and the wrappings of the
body of pure white silk, embroidered with pearls and precious
stones. Incredible quantities of massive jewellery decked the
shrunken corpse, and a diadem of glittering gems cast its
prismatic radiance over the withered features. Tiny golden
lamps, fed with perfumed oil, burned day and night around
the pyre, while every portion of the vast saloon was decorated
with rare and beautiful flowers, arranged in all the various
forms of crowns, sceptres, temples, angels, birds, lanterns,
wreaths, and arches, till Flora herself might have wondered
at the boundless resources of her domain. Day and night
musical instruments were played, dirges wailed forth, and
prostrations perpetually performed; while twice every day
the king, attended by his whole court, made offerings to the
departed spirit, beat his breast, tore his hair, and declared
life 'utterly unendurable without the beloved one.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>All this was kept up for eight months, and then the
scene changed for one of festivity. For thirty days, during
most of which time I was present, there was a succession of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">levées</i>, concerts, and theatricals, with feats of jugglery, operas,
and fireworks; and then the embalmed body, surrounded by
perfumes and tiny faggots of sandal-wood, was consumed by
fire, and the ashes collected by the high-priest or his deputy
in a golden urn, and deposited, with other relics of royalty,
in the king's palace.</p></blockquote>

<p>How very different from the above is a cremation
amongst the North American Indians (the Cocopa
tribe), on the Colorado river! Here is an account of
one published in a late New York paper by an eyewitness,
Professor Le Conte.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A short distance from the collection of thatched huts
which composed the village, a shallow ditch had been dug in
the desert, in which were laid logs of the mezquite (Prosopis
and Strombocarpus), hard and dense wood, which makes, as
all Western campaigners know, a very hot fire with little
flame or smoke. After a short time the body was brought
from the village, surrounded by the family and other inhabitants,
and laid on the logs in the trench. The relatives, as
is usual with Indians, had their faces disfigured with black
paint, and the females, as is the custom with other savages,
made very loud exclamations of grief, mingled with what
might be supposed to be funeral songs. Some smaller
faggots were then placed on top, a few personal effects of the
dead man added, and fire applied. After a time a dense
mass of dark-coloured smoke arose, and the burning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
body, which was much emaciated, proceeded rapidly. I
began to be rather tired of the spectacle, and was about to
go away, when one of the Indians, in a few words of Spanish,
told me to remain, as there was something yet to be seen.
An old man then advanced from the assemblage, with a
long pointed stick in his hand. Going near to the burning
body, he removed the eyes, holding them successively in
the direction of the sun, with his face turned towards that
luminary, repeating at the same time some words which
I understood from our guide were a prayer for the happiness
of the soul of the deceased. After this, more faggots
were heaped on the fire, which was kept up for perhaps
three or four hours longer. I did not remain, as there
was nothing more of interest, but I learned on inquiry that
after the fire was burned out it was the custom to collect the
fragments of bone which remained, and put them in a
terra-cotta vase, which was kept under the care of the family.</p></blockquote>

<p>From these old-world practices&mdash;for they are old-world
practices, although performed at the present
day&mdash;we will now turn aside to examine into the
modern and improved systems of cremation. The
extracts which I shall make will be mostly from the
work of Dr. De Pietra Santa.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> First of all come the
experiments made by Dr. Polli at the gas works in Milan.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In a cylindrical retort of refracting clay, used for the
distillation of coal-gas, was placed the body of an unfortunate
poodle dog, drowned for contravention of the muzzle laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
promulgated by the police. The dog weighed twenty-two
and a half pounds. The apparatus was heated by a crown of
flames issuing from a perforated circular tube. In order to
render combustion as active as possible, the coal-gas was
mixed with a certain quantity of pure air. Our readers will
recollect this addition of atmospheric air is the principle of
the Bunsen burner, which ensures perfect combustion of coal-gas,
and produces a maximum of heat with a minimum of
light. The cremation lasted several hours, producing a
thick smoke, &amp;c. After carbonisation, the skilful chemist
succeeded in obtaining complete incineration, that is to say,
the calcination of all the solid parts of the body, which
weighed one pound fourteen-and-a-half ounces.</p>

<p>Satisfied with the result of this experiment, which proved
the possibility of reducing the carcase of an animal to ashes
by ordinary coal-gas, Dr. Polli proceeded with a second and
more complete experiment. One improvement was the
disposition of a vertical retort in such manner as to consume
the gaseous products of combustion. This is easily effected
by placing at the upper orifice of the retort a second ring of
gas jets. On this occasion better arrangements were made
for carrying out the principle of the Bunsen burner, with
the result of producing the complete incineration of a dog
weighing forty-two and three-quarter pounds in the space of
a couple of hours. On this occasion the solid residue weighed
only two pounds and some ounces.</p>

<p>Few have given more time and study to practical cremation
than Professor Brunetti. This gentleman sent a
case of apparatus to the Vienna Exhibition, and records his
conviction&mdash;arrived at after five experiments upon human
bodies&mdash;that the total incineration of a corpse and the complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
calcination of the bones by fire is, under ordinary
conditions, impossible. He has tried various combustibles,
gas retorts, closed vessels, and the open air, and has arrived
at the conclusion that special apparatus is indispensable to
the success of any attempt at perfect cremation. His apparatus
consists of an oblong furnace built of ordinary, or, still
better, of refracting brick, and furnished with ten side
openings, in order to give the power of regulating at will
the draught, and consequently the intensity of the fire. In
the upper part is a cornice of tiles, destined to support an
iron framework, above which is the dome-shaped roof, furnished
with cast-iron shutters, which may be opened or
closed by means of regulators, to shut in the flame and
concentrate the heat. The body to be incinerated is placed
upon a thin metallic plate, suspended by stout iron wire.
The operation may be divided into three sections. Firstly,
the kindling of the body; secondly, its combustion; thirdly,
the incineration of the soft parts, and the calcination of the
bones. Wood having been piled up in the furnace and
lighted, the body catches fire at the end of half an hour.
A considerable quantity of gas is now evolved, and the
moveable shutters come into operation. The body then
burns freely, and, if the pile of wood have been deftly
arranged, complete carbonisation ensues at the end of a
couple of hours. The shutters are then opened, another
sheet of metal is lowered over the carbonised mass to concentrate
the heat still more, and the wood is renewed. By
means of this apparatus, and at the cost of 160 or 180 lbs.
of wood, complete cremation is achieved in two hours more.
When the furnace is cold, the residue is collected and placed
in a funereal urn. The last experiment of Dr. Brunetti was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
made upon the body of a man who died, at the age of fifty,
of chronic bronchitis.</p></blockquote>

<p>A description of a Siemens apparatus as constructed
for use in Germany is given by Professor Reclam in
an article entitled 'Die Feuerbestattung' in the
'Gartenlaube.' A sketch of it in action, partly copied
from this article, is given in Plate I.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It consists of (1) a gasometer for the manufacture of the
gas necessary to heat the furnace; (2) the furnace itself,
with a regulator and a space for burning; (3) a chimney to
take away the smoke &amp;c. We may conceive a large, beautiful
dead-house built for the purposes of cremation. In the
midst, but invisible to those present, is a furnace. The
funeral procession arrives at the house, and enters it the
same as the churchyard is now entered. When the coffin
has been placed on the tressel, and the usual ceremony
ended, it is let down into the grave and disappears. In a
short time after it is let down the covering of the furnace is
removed, and replaced when it has received the coffin.</p>

<p>The process of cremation is effected by means of heated
air. The gasometer is put in action by the consumption
of coal, charcoal, peat, or wood. The gas thus produced
is conducted through a pipe provided with a regulating-valve,
where, meeting with a stream of air, also under regulation,
it is converted into a flame. This flame extends
through the room which has the regulator, so that the brick
material which is piled up there is heated to white heat,
and kept to this. The flame still continuing, supplies heat
till the furnace or place for the reception of the body is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
heated to a weak red heat, when the flame escapes through
a pipe into the chimney.</p>

<p>As soon as the furnace is in the condition thus described,
the process of cremation goes on. The covering of the furnace
is removed by the man who superintends the burning
of the bodies. It is put back again, and the body subjected
to the action of the red heat for a longer or a shorter time,
according to its physical condition. After this is done the
gas-valve is closed, and the air in consequence goes through
the regulator into the place for burning. It is here heated
in the regulator nearly to red heat, in which condition it
comes to the bodies already, in some measure, dried, so
that decomposition soon follows. The bones are decomposed
by the action of the heat, while the carbonate dissolves,
and the lime remains as dust. To collect this dust an instrument
is provided, that it may be placed in a jar, or
any other vessel, and preserved by the relatives of the
deceased.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The most perfect apparatus, however, yet devised
for the reduction of a body to ashes is that adopted by
Sir Henry Thompson. From his work upon cremation
I take the following description, which will be always
studied with interest. This extract will fitly conclude
these quotations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A powerful reverberating-furnace will reduce a body of
more than average size and weight, leaving only a few
white and fragile portions of earthy material, in less than
one hour. I have myself personally superintended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
burning of two entire bodies, one small and emaciated, of
47 lbs. weight, and one of 144 lbs. weight, not emaciated,
and possess the products&mdash;in the former case weighing
1¾ lb.; in the latter, weighing about 4 lbs. The former
was completed in twenty-five minutes, the latter in fifty.
No trace of odour was perceived&mdash;indeed, such a thing is
impossible&mdash;and not the slightest difficulty presented itself.
The remains already described were not withdrawn till the
process was complete; and nothing can be more pure,
tested by sight or smell, than they are; and nothing less
suggestive of decay or decomposition. It is a refined sublimate,
and not a portion of refuse, which I have before
me. The experiment took place in the presence of several
persons. Among the witnesses of the second experiment
was Dr. George Buchanan, the well-known medical officer
of the Local Government Board, who can testify to the
completeness of the process.</p>

<p>In the proceeding above described, the gases which
leave the furnace-chimney during the first three or four
minutes of combustion are noxious; after that they cease
to be so, and no smoke would be seen. But these noxious
gases are not to be permitted to escape by any chimney,
and will pass through a flue into a second furnace, where
they are entirely consumed; and the chimney of the latter
is smokeless&mdash;no organic products whatever can issue by
it. A complete combustion is thus attained. Not even a
tall chimney is necessary, which might be pointed at as that
which marked the site where cremation is performed. A
small jet of steam, quickening the draught of a low chimney,
is all that is requisite. If the process is required on
a large scale, the second furnace could be utilised for cremation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
also, and its product passed through another, and
so on without limit.</p></blockquote>

<p>This plan, however, has been thrown into the shade
by subsequent experiments:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By means of one of the furnaces invented by Dr. Wm.
Siemens, I have obtained even a more rapid and more complete
combustion than before. The body employed was a
severe test of its powers, for it weighed no less than 227 lbs.,
and was not emaciated. It was placed in a cylindrical
vessel about 7 feet long, by 5 or 6 feet in diameter, the
interior of which was already heated to about 2,000° Fahr.
The inner surface of the cylinder is smooth, almost polished,
and no solid matter but that of the body is introduced into
it. The product, therefore, can be nothing more than the
ashes of the body. No foreign dust can be introduced, no
coal or other solid combustible being near it: nothing
but heated hydrocarbon in a gaseous form, and heated air.
Nothing is visible in the cylinder before using it&mdash;a pure,
almost white, interior&mdash;the lining having acquired a temperature
of white heat. In this case the gases, given off
from the body so abundantly at first, passed through a
highly-heated chamber, among thousands of interstices made
by intersecting firebricks, laid throughout the entire chamber,
lattice-fashion, in order to minutely divide and delay
the current, and expose it to an immense area of heated
surface. By this means they were rapidly oxidised, and not
a particle of smoke issued by the chimney; no second
furnace, therefore, is necessary by this method to consume
any noxious matters, since none escape. The process was
completed in fifty-five minutes; and the ashes, which
weighed about 5 lbs., were removed with ease.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>After such brilliant results&mdash;results at once expeditious,
cleanly, and economical&mdash;well might Sir Henry
Thompson challenge Mr. Holland<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> 'to produce so
fair a result from all the costly and carefully managed
cemeteries in the kingdom,' and safely might he
even offer him twenty years 'in order to elaborate the
process.'</p>

<p>An ordinary Siemens' regenerative furnace for
cremation makes use of only hot blast, it being considered
that the organic substance to be consumed
would supply sufficient hydrogen and carbon, and
that only hot air is required to produce excellent
results. But a perfect apparatus would be constructed
upon the principle exhibited in Plate II., which represents
the cremation apparatus devised by Dr. C. W.
Siemens, F.R.S., of Westminster.</p>

<p>The body to be reduced to its elements is placed
in the chamber <small>A</small> (fig. 1), which is iron-cased and
lined inside with a substance able to resist the highest
temperature. Figs. 1 and 2 represent the consuming
arrangement, which may form a portion of the chapel
itself. Figs. 3 and 4 show the gas-producer, where
the gaseous fuel is produced, and this may be situated
at some distance from the building where the cremation
is performed. These gas-producers are not
only separate from the cinerator, where the heat is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
required, but may be multiplied or extended, so as
to supply any number of cinerators, and so separately
reduce a plurality of bodies. At the back of the
heating chamber A are placed four firebrick-celled
regenerative chambers for gas and air, seen in section
at fig. 2, and these work in pairs. The gas carried
from the gas-producer is directed into the gas regenerator,
and the entering air into the air regenerator,
and in these regenerators both gas and air are heated,
attaining a temperature equal to a white heat before
they reach the chamber <small>A</small> in which the body is laid.
The heated air, after passing upwards through the
regenerator, enters the consuming chamber at <small>B</small>, and
the heated gas enters it at <small>C</small>. They thus enter the
chamber separately, and with a sufficient velocity
to impinge against the door of the chamber; but
when they meet at the point <small>D</small> in the chamber, the
gas and air mingle and add to the carried heat that
due to the mutual chemical action. The result is a
devouring flame. One pair of regenerators are always
employed in conducting the heated air and gas into
the chamber <small>A</small>, whilst the other pair are employed
in carrying away the combined gases or expended
fuel to the chimney. This expended fuel is nevertheless
an immensely hot flame, and on its way to
the chimney it proceeds downwards through one pair
of the regenerators, the upper portion of which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
heats intensely. Nearly the whole of the heat of the
expended fuel is left in the regenerators, and the
smokeless gases which enter the chimney to be cast
into the air rarely exceed 300° Fahr. By means of
valves the regenerators and air-ways which were
carrying off the expended fuel, can be instantly used
for carrying air and gas into the reducing chamber,
and the heat left in them consequently utilised. Not
only is a saving of 50 per cent. in fuel thus effected,
but the noxious gases from the body would be entirely
consumed in their passage down through the regenerators.</p>

<p>The gas-producer itself (figs. 3 and 4) works in
the following manner:&mdash;The coal is supplied to the
charging-box <small>E</small> every three hours or so, and slides
down an inclined plane, the upper portion of which
is solid and covered with firebricks. Upon this
sloping bed the fuel is heated, and its volatile constituents
are liberated, just as in a gas retort, leaving
about 60 per cent. of carbonaceous matter, the complete
combustion of which is brought about by the
air which enters through the open part of the grate
at the foot of the sloping bed. More carbonic acid
gas is now evolved, and this non-combustible gas
passes through the red-hot fuel, taking up in its
passage another equivalent of carbon, and so becoming
an inflammable gas, or what is called carbonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
oxide. Should it be considered advisable to make
use of steam, each cubic foot of which yields as
much inflammable gas as five cubic feet of air, a pipe
of water is allowed to run at the foot of the grate,
and is there converted into steam by the radiant
heat. The combustible gases now pass into the main
gas flue, and inasmuch as this gas flue must contain
an excess of pressure above the exterior air, so as to
prevent the inroad of atmospheric air into the gas
flue, and consequent partial combustion, the gas is
allowed to rise&mdash;which it will do by its initial heat&mdash;some
score of feet above the producers, and is carried
horizontally through the wrought iron tube <small>F</small> into
and then down into the furnace. The flat-lying tube
being exposed to the air causes the gas in its passage
through it to lose about 200° Fahr. of temperature,
which increases its density, adds weight to the descending
column of gas, and presses it on to the
furnace. One estimable feature in this system of gas-producing
is that the production can be arrested for
half a day without deranging the producer, the fuel
and brickwork being sufficiently bulky to maintain
a dull red heat for that period. Air cannot enter
the grate unless the gases given off in the producer
are withdrawn to the furnace; and when the gas valve
of the furnace is reopened, the production of the gases
is once more continued.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p>It has been urged against cremation by sentimentalists,
that if the burning could be observed in even
an improved apparatus, the process would prove
a harrowing one, recall in fact to mind the horrors
described by the Comte de Beauvoir in his Indian
reminiscences.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> But no such thing would result, for
whilst being consumed the body would remain of itself
perfectly motionless and without visible contraction
or convulsion. Several late human cremations which
have taken place in the Siemens Works in Dresden,
have been purposely witnessed by eminent scientific
men and others, through the glass panel of the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
which is always provided for the use of the manufacturing
operator, and the utter absence of anything
which could prove in the least distressing to the mind,
the eye, or the imagination, is vouched for by all.
The current of combined air and gas simply plays
upon the body with a transparent flame, until the
whole becomes incandescent. There is not even the
least effluvium. In a late experiment, when nearly a
quarter of a ton of animal matter underwent cinerary
treatment at Dresden, the gases between the flue and
the chimney proper were intercepted by an aspirator,
and found perfectly inodorous.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Once incandescent,
the body soon assumes a hue of translucent white, and
then speedily crumbles into ashes.</p>

<p>The quantity of ashes left from a body of average
weight has been foretold by Sir Henry Thompson
almost to the fraction of a pound. There is no doubt
whatever also that the time named by him as sufficient
for entire reduction will be borne out in practice. As
regards the cost of cremation, Sir Henry is most assuredly
correct in lauding its economy over interment.
The cost of the fuel expended during the last three
cremations in Germany did not exceed 3<i>s.</i>, plus of
course the percentage to be charged for attendance,
and for the use of the apparatus, which latter would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
be trifling were it in constant use. When the clerical
fees and all the costs of conveyance, &amp;c., are added
thereto, the whole sum would not necessarily exceed
that of a seventh-class funeral in London.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>The above Table represents the details of six
recent human cremations.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The body to be burnt would, in the first instance,
soon after death<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> be placed, perhaps, in a coffin of
some light material, and taken in due time to the
mortuary,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> ready for conveyance to the 'cinerator.'
And, as it is very desirable that the ashes of the
body should be kept separate from those of any
coffin, a shroud of some imperishable material will
be carefully sought after by inventors. The ancient
Greeks made use of sheets of asbestos, which is a
fibrous form of hornblende;<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and those of the
Egyptians who performed cremation enclosed the
body in a receptacle of amianth, which is a similar
incombustible mineral substance.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Whether these
materials will resist the intense heat of the Siemens
apparatus remains to be seen; for I have had no
opportunities of making experiments. Wood, at all
events, is likely to be rejected, on account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
residue of carbon, &amp;c. (charcoal), which might not be
easily separated from the more precious relics. Lead
would be equally objectionable, for, although easily
fusible, it possesses certain disadvantages easily to be
imagined. In all probability the most suitable material
for the inner coffin, which alone is to be submitted
to the impingement of the hot blast, will be zinc.
This metal would entirely disappear in the fierce heat,
the reason being that it is volatile, and would distil
off&mdash;its boiling-point being 800° Cent.,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> or 500° Fahr.
below the minimum temperature which will reign in
the chamber of the apparatus.</p>

<p>The English and the German machinery for the
reduction of the body to ashes vary in a few particulars,
but the general construction is the same, as
will have been perceived. In one Dresden arrangement
the body is lowered into a receiver below,
and the idea of interment is thus in a manner preserved.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
In the English arrangement this is otherwise,
and the coffin is made to gradually slide into
the receiver, like a ship launched into water. The
anguish induced by the moment of departure is in
this way somewhat ameliorated, as there is no noise
of lowering-machinery to grate upon the ear. At
certain appointed words in our beautiful funeral service&mdash;for
instance, 'ashes to ashes'&mdash;a curtain might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
be partially withdrawn, and the body, encased in a
suitable shell, would gravitate slowly into the chamber
of the apparatus, which would then immediately
close noiselessly; to be opened only after the due
reduction of the body. The utmost privacy would
be insured, and no strange eyes could gaze upon it<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
during the period of incineration. The funeral service
could also be made to occupy the whole of the
time necessary for sublimation if it were so desired,
or a eulogy or other reference to the departed
might form the subject of a discourse. The ashes
could afterwards be collected, and reverentially placed
in an urn,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> or other suitable receptacle, and conveyed
to their last resting-place. Plate III. represents a
view of a mortuary chapel, such as would probably
be required in a Christian cemetery; and the scene
there represented will serve to show how completely
decorous the procedure would be.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> And one may
here remark that the great advances made by science
can nowhere better be evidenced than by a comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
between the modern and ancient systems of
cremation. However well disguised in beautiful language&mdash;as,
for instance, by Bulwer in the 'Last
Days of Pompeii'&mdash;the barbarity of the method
practised in classical times will be sensibly felt in the
background.</p>

<p>It is likely enough that whenever cremation is
again practised, urns will form the chosen receptacles
of the ashes. Vases or urns have always been associated
with sepulture in classical times. The finest
vases which have come down to us from antiquity
were not originally intended for sepultural purposes,
but for the adornment of the mansion. Frequently,
however, these were deposited in the tombs along
with the unburnt body,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> as being the objects most
valued by the deceased when living. The survivors
doubtless held it as sacrilegious to make use of these
favourite objects, for they are found unmolested even
now.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that amongst the Ojibois
Indians of the present day the canoe, gun, and
blanket, which are laid upon the grave of each one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of the tribe, although newly purchased, are never
made use of again, nor ever stolen.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Many other
Indian tribes observe the same custom;<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> and the
Moldavians and the Caubees as well.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>The custom of depositing the painted vases in
tombs ceased about the time when Italy and Sicily
fell completely under Roman dominion. The Romans,
who burnt their dead, deposited their ashes in urns, as
we have seen. No ashes, it may be said generally,
have been found in the Greek tombs of Italy, but
the Romans made use of the vases found in tombs
made by the Greeks there, as cinerary urns for their
dead; and this appropriation was not uncommon. In
the case of a member of the Roman family of Claudia
an ancient Egyptian vase, now in the Louvre, was
utilised in this manner.</p>

<p>The ancient painted vases are now divided into
six classes, embracing forty-nine various shapes.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The
styles are also divided into Early or Egyptian, Archaic
Greek, Severe or Transitional, Beautiful or Greek,
Florid, and into those of the Decadence period.
Should cremation be extensively adopted nowadays,
it is not unlikely that all these forms and styles will
be laid under contribution. A friend<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> has kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
drawn for the present work a dozen urns, adapted
for the reception of human ashes (<i>see</i> Plate IV.).
Fig. 1 is Archaic in shape; fig. 3 belongs to the
Perfect or Beautiful forms; and fig. 2 represents a
shape often used during the Florid era. The others
are original designs based upon classic lines, but not
referable to any one period. Some very elegant forms
of the ancient vases, copied from gems and other
archæological resources, are to be found embodied in
the monuments of the churchyards and cemeteries of
the present day.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Had the practice of cremation followed uninterruptedly
down to our times, the receptacles for the
ashes would doubtless have been shaped according
to the prevailing taste of each period of architecture.
For instance, the genius of the Semicircular style,
which prevailed from the sixth to the twelfth centuries,
and embraced the Anglo-Saxon and Norman
periods, would have left its own peculiar mark, just
as it has done upon the fonts which were sculptured
during its sway. The Early Pointed, the Geometrical,
and the Decorated and Late or Perpendicular Gothic
periods would, in a similar manner, have influenced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
symmetry of the vases produced between the twelfth
and fifteenth centuries, and contributed their own
quota of beautiful shapes. And, speaking generally,
ecclesiastical taste, which presided over every detail of
church construction down even to the piercing of the
keys, would have been as easily recognisable in the vases
which contained the ashes of the dead.</p>

<p>It is impossible to prophesy in what direction the
taste of the future may wander as regards the shape
of cinerary vessels, but there can be no doubt whatever
that in many instances they will assume a distinctly
ecclesiastical character. The classic patterns of vases
and urns would be in excellent keeping with the
architecture of churches built after Greek and Roman
models; whilst they might appear otherwise if exposed
to view in the niches of the walls of a Gothic fane.
But it may fairly be predicted that the architectural
style of the church will have to bow to the varying
tastes of the worshippers, and just as we see in Westminster
Abbey&mdash;that beautiful example of the Early
Pointed style&mdash;the utmost diversity of taste in the
monuments which cluster upon its walls, so the walls
and vaults of our churches must necessarily accommodate
every type of fancy whenever cremation
resumes its sway. Cinerary vessels, in accordance
with revived mediæval taste, will probably predominate.
Some, it may be, will even assume the shapes of ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
reliquaries.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> There is no reason why these vessels
should not vary, in material and design, with the taste
or means of the relatives. Glass, precious metals, and
even gems, might with propriety be introduced. Urns
of gold and silver were not uncommon in ancient times,
and are even yet used in Siam.</p>

<p>With reference to the material of which cinerary
urns were formerly made, pottery was chiefly chosen
on account of the facility of manufacture, but they
were frequently constructed of marble, alabaster, and
glass. Perhaps the most beautiful cinerary urn in
the world was the Barberini or Portland vase, now in
the British Museum, and which contained the ashes
of the Emperor Alexander Severus. It was made of
blue glass upon which a coating of white glass was
overlaid, and the latter cut cameo fashion into a
number of emblematical figures. Glass was frequently
adopted in Italy for cinerary urns, and will probably
be the favourite material once more.</p>

<p>Besides the placing of the ashes of the dead in
urns, use was frequently made of small stone sarcophagi,
and these latter are found in several of the
ancient Greek burial-grounds in Anatolia. This will
possibly be the form adopted in the future, should an
interment of the ashes be chosen in preference to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
ennichement. But this is not to say that urns are
not equally suitable for laying in the earth if constructed
with that view. Probably both forms of
containing vessels will be patronised, just as was the
case in olden times. In ancient Dardanus stone sarcophagi
are commonly found, whilst at Batak, nearer
the supposed site of Troy, urns only were discoverable;
and yet the ornaments upon the smaller articles of
pottery, found in both sarcophagi and urns, were
identical in pattern, as far as I can recollect.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>The cinerary urns of the Romans were for the
most part at one time placed in underground vaults,
the walls of which were pierced with arched recesses
for their reception, and, from the resemblance of the
numerous niches to a collection of pigeon-holes, the
place was called a <i>columbarium</i>. Two fine columbaria
can be seen at Rome, one in the Vigna Codini and
another in the Villa Doria. Should this system of
storing away the cinerary urns be adopted in our
churches, the crypts would for the most part resemble
the sketch given in Plate VI., which is an enlargement
and rearrangement of the columbarium given in
Westropp's 'Handbook of Archæology.' There can
be no doubt that this will prove the most popular
method of disposing of the urns in modern cities where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
cremation is about to be practised. The catacombs
in our cemeteries, or what pass as such, will also
admirably enshrine the urns. It is not at all unlikely
that in some instances the walls of the churches themselves
will in future be constructed so as to receive the
remains, and bear some sort of resemblance to the
famous church at Cologne where the osteological
relics are placed around the fane.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> But in the case
of urn sepulture the appearance would be far more
æsthetical. In all probability the wall spaces would
be apportioned out into family receptacles, and the
orifices closed with suitable metal gratings ornamentally
treated. I have furnished an imaginary
view of this kind of treatment at the upper part of
Plate VI.</p>

<p>My task is now completed; but before I lay down
the pen I would say to those who are desirous of
promoting the cause of cremation, Do so, within due
bounds, fearlessly. Do not believe that the practice
is in any way opposed to religion, for such a
belief has no anchorage in truth. And in order to
practically bring nearer to us the time when our
much-enduring mother earth shall no longer be
systematically poisoned, all those who are favourable
to the institution of cremation should forthwith put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
into writing their desire that their remains shall not
be buried, but shall be consumed according to the
method of cremation best attainable.</p>

<p>If every individual promoter, male or female, of
fifteen years old and upwards&mdash;without reference to
the possession of property in any way&mdash;would, in view
of the uncertainty of life, place such a request in
his or her writing-desk, cremation would speedily
prevail. The change from burial will otherwise be a
protracted one, since few persons have enough strength
of mind to run counter to the general custom, fearing
the indignation of other relatives of the deceased. The
weakest persons, however, have still a greater repugnance
to doing anything contrary to the expressed
wishes of the dead. If, therefore, such a wish can be
exhibited, it will not only, as a rule, be religiously
complied with, but all friends, whatever their own
opinions, will be amply satisfied.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

Continent. Dr. Moretti, of Cannero, in the 'Annali di Chimica,' 1872,
has given to the world some excellent verses; and Professor Polizzi, in a
poem published at Girgenti, 1873, and dedicated to the memory of Dr.
Salsi, has also eloquently apostrophised the subject. Some two-and-twenty
stanzas in the Milanese dialect were published in 1874, by Civelli
of Milan. I have also seen some German verses, signed 'Dranmor,' and a
short but charming poem in the same language by Justinius Kerner. It is
a matter of regret that those of our own poets who have been in favour of
burning the dead did not enshrine their proclivities in verse. Southey,
for instance, wrote that the custom of interment 'makes the idea of a
dead friend more unpleasant. We think of the grave, corruption, and
worms: burning would be better.' But he left us no poetry on the subject.</p></div>

graveyards in the year 1872 found no less than 130 cemeteries occupied
by our dead. Forty-five of them contained no monuments, and 65 only
headstones of the commonest kind. The French had gathered together
some 28,000 of <em>their</em> dead, and formed one large <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">campo santo</i>. The
English commission reported that it would require 5,000<i>l.</i> to put the
graveyards in seemly order, and an annual expenditure of some 200<i>l.</i>
more. It appears that the graves have been frequently rifled by the
Tartar peasantry in search of rings and other valuables. See 'Daily

his address of October in the present year. He says:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Do we not shun, and that most wisely, the presence of those afflicted
with infectious diseases so long as they remain amongst us; and yet, no
sooner are they removed by death, than we are content, with tender
sympathy indeed, and most loving care it is true (but with how much
wisdom?), to lay them in the ground that they may slowly dissipate
their terribly infectious gases through the soil, and saturating that, may
thereby recharge the rains of heaven, as they filter through it, with all
their virulence and terrible power of reproduction in the systems of the
living. I am not the thorough and entire believer in the disinfecting and
depurating power of the soil that I once was; for terrible examples of its
failure have, in my judgment, come under my notice.
</p>
<p>
'Sir Henry Thompson has lately sounded a note of alarm on this subject;
and though, for the present, it may fall upon ears unheeding or
unsympathetic, I yet venture to think that, in time to come, his warning
will be enforced by stern necessity, and that some better method of disposing
of our dead will take the place of the burial so honoured and
revered by us.'</p></div>

into an open brook, and the drainage eventually runs into the River
Brent. The cemetery at Tooting at the present moment discharges into
an open ditch, and this flows into the River Wandle, from which many
of the inhabitants in its vicinity are accustomed to draw supplies.</p></div>

reports of the active propaganda which is being carried on abroad, a
great number of articles, favourable or well inclined to the practice, have
appeared in the public press: for instance, in the 'Daily News,' 'Telegraph,'
'Standard,' 'Morning Advertiser,' 'Globe,' 'Saturday Review,'
'Court Journal,' and numerous illustrated and other papers. The 'British
Medical Journal,' 'Lancet,' 'Medical Press and Circular,' 'Medical
Record,' 'Sanitary Record,' 'Students' Journal and Hospital Gazette,'
&amp;c., have also borne witness to its value as a sanitary measure. Both
Church and Nonconformist journals have moreover written in its favour,
and several able articles have appeared in the periodicals, for example,
in the 'Dublin University Magazine' and 'Westminster Review.' Most
valuable assistance, demanding special notice, has also been rendered to
cremation by that highly scientific periodical, 'Iron.' The process has
also been made the subject of discussion in various debating societies,
and in May 1874 the Cambridge University Union adopted a motion by
101 votes to 42 in favour of introducing it into England.</p></div>

having been placed in an urn, and when the distraught father enquires for
his missing daughter, the vase is placed in his hands by the sorrowing
lover. When this scene is presented, the thrill which seizes the audience
is succeeded by a sensation of admiration at the eminently superior
system of the ancients. I have seen the actor Brooke in this tragedy, and
the effect which he here produced was inexpressible. Many whom I have
consulted as to the feelings engendered at this point, have invariably declared
that they were at the time complete converts to cremation, and
that the sense of approval only left them when they began to realise how
impossible were funeral pyres in this country. Happily the Siemens
apparatus is now at hand, and its suitability proved beyond all cavil.</p></div>

the English pattern of cinerator permit it. When the time needful for
reduction has been accurately calculated, such exposure will be unnecessary.

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
