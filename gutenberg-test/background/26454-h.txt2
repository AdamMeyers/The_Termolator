Punch, or the London Charivari

Volume 104, May 6th 1893

edited by Sir Francis Burnand




A PATHETIC LAMENT.

(Respectfully addressed to one of the Promoters of the Anti-Advertisement
League by a Repentant Subscriber.)




  
I.
  

  
Being gifted with decent taste and a sensitive eye,
I have never been much beguiled
By advertisements, crude in colour, and ten feet high
(Which, in fact, I rather reviled);
And, as for gigantic signs swinging up in the sky&mdash;
They drove me perfectly wild!
    

  
II.
  

  
Then the lurid posters on paling and chimney-stack
Were the terror of every town&mdash;
Till a League was started by Mr. William Black
For the purpose of putting them down;
And the sympathetic invited its efforts to back
With an annual half-a-crown.
    

  
III.
  

  
So I cheerfully paid the fee, and my name was enrolled,
And a solemn oath I swore;
(As is usual on such occasions,&mdash;or so I'm told)
That, in future, no shop or store
Which aggressively advertised any article sold
I would patronise any more!
    

  
IV.
  

  
But that mad rash oath I recall with a vain regret,
As I brood in bitter complaint,
On the number of useful things that I'm dying to get&mdash;
And my conscience tells me I mayn't!
As their various virtues are vaunted in letters of jet,
Or gaudier gilding and paint!
    

  
V.
  

  
I should like to be clean if I could&mdash;but I cannot cope,
Without saponaceous aid,
With a shower of London smuts&mdash;and I'm losing hope,
Getting daily a dingier shade,
In a futile search for a genuine Toilet-soap
That has shunned meretricious parade!
    

  
VI.
  

  
My villa would be&mdash;when it's furnished&mdash;the cosiest nest,
But I fear it is doomed to be bare;
For upholsterers' puffs are now a persistent pest,
And so shamelessly each will declare
His "Elegant Dining and Drawing-room suites" are the "cheapest and best"&mdash;
That I daren't choose so much as a chair!
    

  
VII.
  

  
I would fly to the Ocean shore, or the Continent,
To escape from a lot accurst;
But here, by my own parole, I'm a prisoner pent!
I must find a Company first
That doesn't resort to obtrusive advertisement&mdash;
And the Railway ones are the worst!
    

  
VIII.
  

  
And now I'm developing symptoms of bodily ills,
But, however sanguine I've felt,
Of a cure from So-and-So's Syrup, Elixir, or Pills,
Or his Neuro-magnetic Belt&mdash;
Can I buy, when their fame is based on a stratum of bills
Down every area dealt?
    

  
IX.
  

  
And even my path to a tranquil tomb is barred
While that oath continues to bind;
For a coffin and funeral car will be somewhat hard
For a faithful adherent to find&mdash;
When already each undertaker has left a card
With his terms and "inquiries kind"!
    

  
X.
  

  
So you see, Mr. William Black, what a mess I've made!
And you'll own my dilemmas are due
To the oath which I took when I followed your precious crusade.
If its terms were drafted by you,
You may know some ingenious means their effect to evade&mdash;
Kindly drop me a line if you do!
    



TO BLACKHAM'S BOYS.

(The Australian Cricketers have arrived in
England.)

  
Welcome, John McCarthy Blackham,
And his boys! 'Tis safe to back 'em,
Giffen, Bannerman, and Turner,
To teach Bull&mdash;a cheerful learner!
Austral Cricket "up to date."
Bruce and Trumble&mdash;rather late&mdash;
Owing to Lutetia's charms!
Soon will join their chums in arms.
Lyons and M'leod are ready;
Dashing George and Alec steady,
And the others, prompt to pitch 'em
(Stumps) on the old sward at Mitcham.
Punch will wish you all fair weather,
And fair luck! Now, all together!!!
May we meet 'em oft&mdash;and whack 'em
Fairly&mdash;these brave boys of Blackham!
    



Habeas Corpus Suspended.&mdash;What is
wanted just now is a "J bez Corpus" Act.
[pg 206]





"SCOT-FREE."

Sir Henry Hawkins (to Justice). "I can't touch them.
It's time You did!" [See next page.]



An Airy Nothing.&mdash;According to a Radical paper "the poor
man's tobacco pays 10&frac12;d. in the shilling to taxation, while the rich
man's cigar pays only &frac12;d. in the shilling to taxation." This may be
very true, but is the question worth discussing? It is sure to end
in smoke!



How they are served in Servia.&mdash;Among some interesting
items, a telegram informed us how "the Young King presided
at a Council of Ministers. The ceremonial is the same as during his
father's time, only two guards stand at the door, and refreshments
are handed round at short intervals." The italics are ours.
Rather! What a pleasant Cabinet Council. Why isn't the convivial
plan adopted here? Mr. G., in the chair, would knock the
table with the hammer every ten minutes and call out, "Give your
orders, Gents! the Waiter's in the room!" A real Harmonious
Meeting.
[pg 207]





"WITHOUT PREJUDICE."

Miss Jeannie (to Elderly Spinster). "I'm glad Maud is going to
be Married to Sir Guy. I'm sure they'll be happy,
they're so well Matched!"

Elderly Spinster aforesaid (who has had her eye on Sir Guy for the
last two years). "I don't at all agree with you. Sir Guy
would have done far better to have chosen One of his own Height!"



THE FUTURE HOPED BY HAWKINS.

(A Cockney Carol by a cruelly-used Coster-Investor. With apologies to
clever Albert Chevalier.)


["I desire to express, and I cannot do it too strongly, that there is no
credit to be attached to the conduct of the directors in this particular case.
It would be more satisfactory to me if directors had a proper sense of their
responsibility. It is a cruel thing that people should be deluded out of their
savings by high-sounding names. At the same time, there is no criminal law
which will punish a director who scandalously neglects his duty, though he
takes his money. I think the law might well be altered."&mdash;Mr. Justice
Hawkins.]


Air.&mdash;"The Future Mrs. 'Awkins."

  
I'm done, my little doner! I'm jest about a goner!
My savings all U. P.!
You always said I shouldn't; but resist big names I couldn't,
No, they fairly nobbled me.
Now Mister Justice 'Awkins, 'onest 'Enery Hawkins,
Some Directors' wool does comb.
So 'elp me bob, I'm crazy. I must ha' bin a daisy!
Won't it bust our 'umble 'ome!
(Spoken or sung.) Won't it!
O Lizer! Sweet Lizer!
If I die in the Big 'Ouse, I'll only 'ave myself to blame.
D'y'ear, Lizer? Dear Lizer!
Fancy me bein' nicked by a 'igh-soundin' name!
  
At their sly board-meetin's wot must be their greetin's!
Oh, they knows wot they're about!
The public tin they close up, at us turns their nose up&mdash;
Fox and Guinea-pigs&mdash;no doubt.
I likes their style, dear Lizer. Ain't it a surpriser?
Cop me on the 'op like this!!!
Sure, I must be dreamin'! In my sleep start screamin'.
There, don't cry, old gal! Let's kiss!
(Spoken or sung.) Come now!
O Lizer! Dear Lizer!
If I lose yer luv by this I'll only 'ave myself to blame!
D'y'ear, Lizer? Dear Lizer!
'Onest 'Enery 'Awkins sez it's a dashed shame!
  
Hartful as a "bonnet," you depend upon it,
Mister Fox, with tail sly-curled!
Jest about the sweetest, neatest, and completest
Diddle in the wide, wide world.
Wot sez 'Enery 'Awkins, 'onest 'Enery 'Awkins?
Law wants alterin' right away.
P'raps it may be one day, but were it next Monday,
Me and you 'twould not repay!
(Spoken or sighed.) Would it?
O Lizer! Sweet Lizer!
Strikes me wot is called the Law is often fuss, and fraud, and fudge!
But dear Lizer! D'y'ear, Lizer?
Mister Justice 'Awkins is a fust-class Judge!
    



Query at some Fashionable Sea-side Resort.&mdash;Do the unpleasant
odours noticeable at certain times arise from the fact of
the tide being high? If so, is the tide sometimes higher than
usual, as the&mdash;ahem!&mdash;odours certainly are?



Shakspearian Question to a Company.&mdash;(To be replied to in the
negative.)&mdash;"What, are you Hansard yet?" (Mer. of Venice,
iv., 1.)



Song for an Emperor after a (Friendly) Visit to Canossa.&mdash;
"Be it ever so humbling, there's no place like Rome!"
[pg 208]



ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.


"At the Sign of the 'Budget Shop."

House of Commons, Monday, April 24.&mdash;House nearly Counted
Out just now, although it's Budget Night and usual Resolutions not
yet passed. Catastrophe averted, and sitting continued. Childers
come back to old scene. Looking on from below Gallery, says it's
the quietest Budget Night he remembers. Usually scene one of
seething excitement. One or more Trades expect taxes affecting
them will either go up or go down. Lobby besieged by anxious representatives.
Nothing of the sort to-night. When Squire of
Malwood rose to expound his mystery, Benches not fuller than on
ordinary night. Of those present there was no speculation in the
eyes they turned upon the Chancellor standing at table. The
Squire, a great Parliamentary
artist, attuned voice and
manner to prevailing tone;
avoided anything approaching
oratorical style; plain business
statement to make; accomplished
it in fine head-clerkly
manner.

An unfailing tradition
about Budget Speech is that
it shall contain at least one
quotation from the Classics.
Mr. G. from year to year observed
this custom with
splendid effect. Lowe's Ex
luce lucellum is famous in history;
nearly became the epitaph
of a Ministry; certainly
was the funeral wail over a
carefully-constructed Budget.
The Squire to-night
felt bound to observe tradition;
but in accordance with
his nature did it modestly,
adventuring nothing more
recondite than citation of the
familiar line that serves to
mark Wren's resting-place
in Westminster Abbey.
Tommy Bowles took opportunity
of remarking that he
was "disappointed with the
Budget." This mental attitude,
though not quite unexpected,
threw fresh gloom
over proceedings, and talk,
reduced to whisper, finally
died out.

Business done.&mdash;Budget
brought in.

Tuesday.&mdash;The young men
behind Prince Arthur out
on the war-path. "Tell you
what," says Legh of Lyme;
"let's have Bryce's scalp."

"By the Holy Roman Empire,
yes!" cried George
Curzon, to whom genial observation
was addressed. "Let's
get at him about his snubbing
Sefton, in matter of appointment
of Lancashire County
Magistrates. 'Twill serve a
double debt to pay. We'll have
a lark&mdash;'Quelles alouettes!' as it is written in the French translation
of Great Expectations, in the passage reporting conversation
between Pip and Joe Gargery. Moreover than which, we'll put a
spoke in business arrangements of Mr. G., and stave off Home Rule
by so long."

"Be careful," said Prince Arthur; "ticklish subject, you
know. They're sure to have Halsbury up, and there unquestionably
was a degree of monotony about his appointments to
Commission of Peace."

"Oh bother Halsbury," said Curzon, to whom nothing is sacred.
"He's used to it by this time. You know what happened to the
viper who bit the Cappadocian's hide? Halsbury's all right."

"Boys will be boys," said Prince Arthur, looking at them
regretfully, and thinking of his own forty-five years. "But
perhaps it will be just as well if I clear out;" which he did, and so
missed a lively debate.

That Elderly Young Man, Hanbury, not in best form for such
operations. Lacks lightness of touch. Henry James also better
out of it. Gave performance serious turn, when he declared that in
borough of Bury Bryce, as soon as he came into office, appointed
eight Magistrates, all Liberals. That sounded very bad; Mr. G.
looked serious; some disposition shown on Treasury Bench to draw
apart from Bryce. All very well to talk about Halsbury's
goings
on; but if this sort of thing done by Liberal purists, things seem
rotten all round. When Bryce came to reply, he quietly added to
James's statement of case that, when he went to the Duchy, he
found of eighteen Magistrates sixteen were Unionists, only two
Liberals. He had, it is true, appointed six Liberals and two working-men,
whose politics he did not know. Bury Bench, accordingly,
now consisted of sixteen Unionists, eight Liberals, and two working-men.
Members wondered if James knew that when he made his
statement? Hoped he didn't. All very well with wig and gown on,
and brief in hand; but House
doesn't like this kind of
thing in debate.

Curzon's statement about
sad condition of Magisterial
Bench at Southport, owing
to machinations of an iniquitous
Chancellor of the
Duchy, turned out to be not
more completely based on
fact than was James's. But
difference of manner in dealing
with case, everything.
No one took Curzon seriously,
and so no harm done.
His explanation of preponderance
of Conservative Magistrates
on Lancashire Bench
delightful. As good as some
touches of Dizzy, of whose
younger, lighter manner, he
much reminded old-stagers.
It was true, he admitted
that, on Lancashire Bench,
preponderance of Magistrates
was with Conservatives.
(Chancellor of Duchy gave
figures as he found them
arranged when he came into
office. On the Borough
Benches, 507 Unionists,
against 159 Liberals; on the
County Bench, 522 Unionists,
against 142 Liberals, a proportion
of nearly four to one.)
But how had it been brought
about? asked the Strayed
Reveller from the Corea.
"Why, it is because the
disturbing, mischievous policy
of the Right Hon. Gentleman
opposite" (this with
indignant sweep of the arm
towards Mr. G., feigning
sleep on the Treasury Bench)
"has driven into the opposite
ranks most of the intelligent,
respectable men,
from whom Justices are
chosen."

On Division, Vote of Censure
on Bryce negatived by
260 votes; against 186. "I'm
not sure," said Jokim, whose
views of humour are limited, "that, what I may call the gain of
three hours lost, is worth the price paid; to wit, the opportunity
given to Bryce of disclosing the actual state of things in Lancashire
in the matter of Magisterial Bench, and the consequent doubling
of the Ministerial Majority."

"Well, as I remarked before," said Prince Arthur, who had
come back for the Division, "Boys will be boys."

Business done.&mdash;Employers' Liability Bill, with aid of Closure,
read Second Time.

Thursday.&mdash;Pretty to watch Mr. G. struggling with feeling of
expediency against temptation to make a speech. House in Committee
on Budget Bill; Jokim been discoursing at large on its proposals.
Quite lively. Squire of Malwood looked on, listening with
generous
approval, albeit he was target for Jokim's jocularity. This
time last year positions reversed. It was he criticising Jokim's
Budget. Now it was Jokim's turn, and the Squire magnanimously
stood the racket. Mr. G. sat by his side, an attentive listener,
[pg 209]
evidently strongly drawn to join in the fray.
But it was plainly the Squire's show, and its
direction must be left to him. When there
followed long succession of eminent men
discussing Budget, Mr. G. felt that if he
remained any longer he must yield to temptation.
Accordingly, withdrew from scene.
Returned again an hour later; still harping
on the Budget; the Squire had spoken twice,
and there seemed nothing to be done but to
work off whatever remaining speeches had
been prepared in Opposition camp.

Dorington dragged in case of farmer, and
small landowner; conversation turned on
Depression of Agriculture; the Woolwich
Infant presented himself to view of sympathetic
House as specimen of what a man of
ordinarily healthy habits might be brought
to by necessity of paying Income-tax on the
gross rental of house property. A procession
of friends of the Agriculturist was closed by
portly figure of Chaplin, another effective
object-lesson suitable for illustration of lectures
on Agricultural Depression. Mr. G.,
feeling there was no necessity for speech,
had resolutely withstood the others. Chaplin
at the table, proved irresistible. To him,
Chaplin is embodiment of the heresy of Protection,
Bi-metallism, and other emanations
of the Evil One. When Chaplin sat down,
Premier romped in, and, having delivered
the inevitable speech, went off home, soothed,
and satisfied.

Business done.&mdash;Budget Scheme passed
through Committee.

Friday.&mdash;Almost forgot we still have House
of Lords. Shall be reminded of their existence
by-and-by. For the nonce, they are
courteously quiescent, the world forgetting,
by the world forgot. Just a little flare-up
to-night. Ireland, of course; Camperdown
wanting to know what about the Evicted
Tenants Commission? Are the Government
going to legislate upon it, or will they
forbear? Selborne supernaturally solemn;
dragged in James the Second as the nearest
approach to any head of a Government quite
so wicked as Mr. G. Lords much interested
in this. Don't hear so much now of James
the Second as we did when at school. The
establishment of points of resemblance between
Governments of his day and that
presided over by Mr. G., a novelty in debate.
Imparted to political controversy a freshness
long lacking.

Just after seven, debate adjourned. For
all practical purposes, it might as well have
been concluded. But House doesn't get many
opportunities of debate; not disposed riotously
to squander this chance one.

Business done.&mdash;Commons had Morning
Sitting; scrupulously devoted the last five
minutes of it to public business.



Operatic Note,&mdash;There's not much magic
about The Magic Ring at the Prince of
Wales's until the Second Act, in which the
extravagantly comic "business" of Messrs.
Monkhouse and Kaye, the burlesque acting
of Miss Susie Vaughan, and the comic trio
dance between the two low comedians and
the sprightly soprano, Miss Marie Halton,
are worth the whole of Act I. When
is burlesque not burlesque? When it is
Comic Opera. Burlesque was reported dead.
Not a bit of it, only smothered; and it may
come up fresh for a long run, or at all events,

MISPLACED MERRIMENT.

PANEFUL!

  
It was the Palace of the Board,
The Board of London's Schooling,
Where Members lately have enjoyed
Some high artistic fooling.
  
"Oh, why"&mdash;hear Mr. Coxhead plead,
In tones of sheer amazement&mdash;
"Do hideous faces wrought in glass
Stare down from every casement?"
  
Then up spake General Moberly,
The Board's supreme apologist,
And told them all the time of day
Like any good horologist.
  
"The Architect," quoth he, "had planned
To grave upon the panes
Portraits of bygone Classic wights,
Of British youth the banes.
  
"But as the Chairman of the Works'
Committee he had said,
That Cicero should be deposed,
And Diggle reign instead.
  
"To oust Herodotus would be
An inexpensive job,
And Socrates should be bowled out
By a seductive Lobb."
  
Further, he argued that it would
Only be right and manly
If Archimedes did resign
His pane to Lyulph Stanley.
  
And out he brought his final word
Both modestly and soberly&mdash;
"I think that Julius C&aelig;sar might
Give place to General Moberly!"
  
O Boardmen, shall the little plan
Be thus allowed to pass?
It will, unless your Veto stop
This filling of the glass!
    



TO ZANTE.

(An Appeal. After E. A. Poe.)

  

"Fair Isle, that from the fairest of all flowers
Thy gentlest of all gentle names doth take!"
How many memories of fierce seismic powers
At sight of thee, as now thou art, awake!
How many scenes of what departed bliss!
How many thoughts of what entombed hopes!
Did Falb foresee such ruinous wreck as this?
No more sits Peace upon thy verdant slopes!
Subscriptions! Ah, that magical sweet sound
Appeals to all, or should appeal. More! More!
Suffering demands still more! Charity's ground
Punch now must hold thy flower-enamelled shore,
O Hyacinthine Isle! O purple Zante!
"Isola d'oro! Fior di Levante!"
    



New Name for It. (By a non-believer
in the much-talked-of&mdash;and talking&mdash;"League."),&mdash;Imperial
Fad-oration!

A LAMENT.

Little Simpkins. "Nearly all our Best Men are Dead! Carlyle,
Tennyson, Browning, George Eliot!&mdash;&mdash;I'm not feeling
very well Myself!"



"IN THE KEY OF RUTHENE."


[The most gorgeous red yet discovered has lately been produced from the
rare metal r&uuml;thenium.]


  
Who'll sell me a second-hand lyre and a plectrum,
Or (since it's the fashion) a mandoline?
Con amore I'd sing the new shade of the spectrum&mdash;
No spook, though it haunts me&mdash;its name is Ruthene.
  
Nay, don't be alarmed, for I'm no supersubtle
Decadent bard with an eye full of green;
I merely (to copy the late Captain Cuttle)
Am "making a note" in the key of Ruthene.
  
Well, R's a red letter, you see its ray glow forth&mdash;
Look in your "dic" if you doubt what I mean;
Red, rufous, rouge, ruddy, rose, russet, and so forth,
Have all rolling r's like resplendent Ruthene.
  
More "clamant" than carmine, vermilion, crimson,
Costlier than diamond or ultramarine&mdash;
A deuce of a theme to chant lyrics or hymns on,
Or rummage for orotund "rot," is Ruthene.
  
Orange-hued are the Odalisque's henna-dyed fingers,
English girls' lips are encarnadine;
A rubicund flame round the toper's nose lingers&mdash;
But I'm blest if they rival the blush of Ruthene.
  
Pink huntsman, gules ensign, deep flush of the sunset,
Cardinal's scarlet, "red" gold have I seen,
With red ruin, red rhubarb, red herring&mdash;but none set
My iris afire as does red-hot Ruthene.
  
The quest, though, is simpler of Roc's egg or Sangreal,
Easier to fashion a flying machine,
Than for my Muse to fake up (forgive Cockney slang) real
Readable rhymes in praise of Ruthene.
    



THE SCOTTISH TREVELYANDERER.

(Mr. Hozier's Version.)


[Mr. Hozier (on the Second Reading of the "Registration of Votes
(Scotland) Amendment Bill") said, "the fame of Mr. Gerry, the Governor
of Massachusetts, would sink into insignificance if this Bill were to pass. In
future they would not talk of Gerrymandering, but of Trevelyandering....
Trevelyandering, however, was a game at which two could play; in fact, in
the words of the poet, they might fairly say:&mdash;


  
"What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,
And possibly two can Trevelyander!"]




Air&mdash;"The British Grenadiers."

  
Some talk of Gerrymander, and some of Herchelles,
Of Halsbury and Mr. Bryce, and such great names as these.
But of all the world's great jobbers (swears Hozier) none compare
With the job, job, job, job, job, job, of the "Tre-vel-yan-der-er!"
  
Gerry, of Massachusetts, was smartish, for his time,
But Hozier "goes one better," it moves his soul to rhyme.
Our Scottish Wegg (sans timber leg) drops into verse&mdash;though queer.
About the game&mdash;which two can play&mdash;of the "Tre-vel-yan-de-rer!"
  
There's Jove, the god of thunder, and Mars, the god of war,
Brave Neptune, with his trident, but here's a greater, far!
Hozier-Apollo now is seen descending from his sphere
To string betimes impromptu rhymes on the "Tre-vel-yan-de-rer!"
  
Then let us fill a bumper, and drink a health to those
Who, "dropping into poetry," leave lesser wits to prose,
And especially to Hozier, who raised a ringing cheer,
By his doggerel delightful on the "Tre-vel-yan-de-rer!"
    



Mr. G. "Shadowed."&mdash;Of course even Mr. G. cannot be "The
Shadowless Man," except under the terms of that weird story,
"which is impossible." The Police have arrived at one important
point about the recently arrested Townsend. They now say,
"We know that man, he comes from Sheffield."

CHRISTY MINSTRELS OF NO IMPORTANCE.




A WORK OF&mdash;SOME IMPORTANCE.

"Let who will give me a plot, I will write their dialogue."
(Extract from Uncommon-place Book of Mr. O. Wilde.) Now
when the author of A Woman of No Importance and of Lady
Windermere's Fan has to find his own materials for a plot
("'Play-wrights'
materials for plots made up.' Idea for Literary and
Dramatic Advertisement" Note-book, O. W.)&mdash;well, he does find
them, and makes them his own. ("Adoption not adaptation. A
clear distinction.&mdash;N.B. I confer the 'distinction'" O. W.) Certainly
"Our Oscar" possesses the happy knack of turning out some
well-polished epigrams up to Drawing-room date. And so it happens
that, during the first two Acts, when Mr. Wilde's dramatis
person&aelig;
are all gathered together, with nothing to do and plenty to
say, their conversation is light and airy, with an occasional sparkler
coming out ("A summer night, with, at intervals, a brilliant meteor
flashing through the sky." Uncom. P. B., O. W.), that crackles, goes
pop like the weasel of the old song, and "then is heard no more,"
as was the case with Macbeth's poor player, and, as he was a poor
player, his fate was not undeserved.&mdash;(Mem. "A Lady Nickleby
or Duchesse de Malapropos, to misquote.&mdash;For example, she might
say, as quoting Shakspeare, 'Life's but a walking candle.'" O. W.)

We all remember how poor Mr. Dick couldn't keep King Charles's
Head out of his manuscript. The Author of No Importance is similarly
affected. Left to himself for a plot, he cannot keep melodrama
out of his play, and what ought to have been a comedy pure and
simple (or the reverse) drops suddenly into old-fashioned theatrical
melodrama. During the first two Acts Lady Hunstanton, Lady
Caroline Pontefract, Mrs. Allonby, Lord Illingworth, The
Venerable
James Daubeny, D.D., talk on pleasantly enough until interrupted
by the sudden apparition of the aforesaid King Charles the First's
Head, represented by the wearisome tirades, tawdry, cheap, and
conventional, belonging to the Lytton-Bulwerian-Money period of
the Drama, of which a considerable proportion falls to the share of the
blameless Miss Julia Neilson, who, as la belle Am&eacute;ricaine,
Hester
Worsley, in her attitude towards her audience, resembles the blessed
Glendoveer, inasmuch as it is "hers to talk, and ours to
hear."
Deeply, too, does everyone sympathise with lively Mrs. Bernard
Beere, who, as Mrs. Arbuthnot, a sort of up-to-date Mrs.
Haller,
is condemned to do penance in a kind of magpie costume of black
velvet, relieved by a dash of white, rather calling to mind the lady
whom Charles Dickens described as "Hamlet's Aunt," her funereal
attire being relieved by a whitened face with tear-reddened eyes. It
is these two characters, with Gerald Arbuthnot, Mr. Fred Terry,
who, like the three gruesome personages in Don Giovanni, will intrude
themselves into what might have been a pleasant, interesting comedy
of modern manners, if only it had had a good comedy plot.

Taken as a whole, the acting is admirable. Mr. Tree, as the
titled cad, Lord Illingworth, is perfect in make-up and manner.
Certainly one of the many best things he has done. It is a companion
portrait to the other wicked nobleman in The Dancing Girl.
("There is another and a worse wicked nobleman" N. B., O. W.)
But this is no fault, and, indeed, it would be difficult, if not impossible,
to find fault with Mr. Tree's Lord Illingworth. Mrs.
Tree as Mrs.
Allonby, is a very charming battledore in the game of
repartee-shuttlecock,
who with eight other principal characters in the piece,
has nothing whatever to do with the plot. To the character of Lady
Hunstanton, as written in the Mrs. Nickleby vein, and as played by
Miss Rose Leclercq, the success is mainly due; and "for this relief
much thanks." It is here and in the comedy characters of the
Archdeacon (Mr. Kemble excellent in this) and of Lady
Caroline
Pontefract (who couldn't have a better representation than Miss
Le Thi&egrave;re) that Mr. O. Wilde shows what he can do as a writer
of comedy, both in the quality of the material and its introduction
at the right moment. ("The right speech at the wrong moment, or
the wrong speech at the right moment, both are fatal. Thus is it
that comedies become tragedies, and tragedies comedies." U.P.N.B.,
O. W.) At the Haymarket the "play's" not "the thing," it is the
playing. ("Likewise the writing," O. W.)

However, it is not for the plot, or for the Bulwery-Lyttony orations,
or for the familiar melodramatic situations that audiences
will seek the Haymarket. No, it will be to hear the Christy-Minstrel
epigrammatic dialogue in the first two Acts, to laugh heartily at
Miss Leclercq as Lady Nickleby Hunstanton, to smile on the
Archdeacon
and Lady Caroline, and to enjoy the first-rate acting all round.

MEMS, FROM THE O. W. UNCOMMONPLACE BOOK.

"Essentials for success of modern play are 'Latitude and
Platitude.' First being risky is saved by second."

Receipt for Play-making.&mdash;First catch your epigrams: preserve
them for use: serve with sauce piquante un pen risqu&eacute;e distributed
impartially among a variety of non-essential dramatis person&aelig;,
invented for the purpose. Provide fine old crusted copybook moral
sentiments, to suit bourgeois palate: throw in the safe situation of
some one concealed, behind door or window, listening to private conversation.
Add one well-tried effective dramatic situation to bring
down curtain on penultimate Act, and there's a stage-dish to set
before the appreciative B. P., if only it can be presented to them
effectively garnished by a clever and popular Manager at a first-class
theatre.



FLOWERS OF FASHION.

The Botanical Afternoon F&ecirc;te of last Wednesday was a brilliant
gathering in brilliant weather. Privileged is "the Inner Circle"
to have in its midst these lovely gardens. "The Flowers that bloom
in the Spring, tra la!" were all out uncommonly early&mdash;long before
the earliest worm, which hasn't a chance against these very early
risers. "All a-growing!" on the part of the flowers, and "all
a-blowing" on the part of the Band of the Second Life Guards.
Among the distinguished company present we noticed the Crimson
Queen, looking immensely well, the blushing Duchess of Albany, the
Duchesse de Vallombrosa, Admiral Courbet, in a striking
costume
of "deep yellow splashed with red" (where had he been?), the
Ladies Daphne Pink and Callas White, and Mar&eacute;chal
Niel.
For "Uriah Heep," who "loves to be 'umble," a Silver Medal was
awarded to Mr. Pike. "The prize, that's my point," observed the
sharp Pike. Funny Fish Pike.



A Penny Wise.&mdash;The new import of the latest Budget may be
aptly called "A Penny for your Thoughts," as no one pays a tax
upon his income as it really exists, but as (for Income-tax assessment
purposes) he believes it to be.

E. Millais, Bart., R.A.

       
No. 131. The Sea Serpent! Caught at last!! General rejoicings!!!

No. 218. His First Cigar.
G. F. Watts, R.A.
	   





No. 375. Disturbed by Wopses. Arthur Hacker.



No. 18. John Hare, Esq.,
as seen and painted by Sir
John E. Millais, Bart., R.A.,
"The Hare Apparent"&mdash;to
every spectator. But what
an unpleasant position! The
eminent Actor is either studying
a part, or has the Box-office
account-book in his
hand, and wants a quiet moment
for serious thought or
close calculation; and yet, in
the next room to him (No. 19),
one of Mr. Orchardson's
young ladies is singing and
playing a yellow chrome-atic
scale, and in the room overhead
(No. 17), Mr. Nettleship's
tiger has broken loose, and is
taking a bath. When rescued
from these surroundings, this will remain at home a Hare-loominous
picture for the family.

No. 28. "Toe-Toe chez Ta-Ta." Miss Toetoe, in blue, at work
and looking down, says to the other girl, Tata, who is maliciously
smiling at her, "Oh dear! I do hope that no one will look at my
right thumb or my toes! O Mr. Woods, A., why was my right
thumb left like this?"

No. 34. In this Mr. Morley Fletcher shows us a Female Martyr
in Tomartyr-coloured dress, preparatory to being taken off to the
Auto da f&eacute;.

No. 45. "An Undress Rehearsal" Stuart G. Davis.

No. 49. "On the Temple Steps." By John Griffiths. For
years we've known that Griffiths is "the safe man" to follow.
But, unless this is a work of pure imagination, anyone well acquainted
with the Temple Pier and the Temple Steps will naturally
ask, "Where are the Steam-boats?"

Nos. 51, 52, and 53. The first is a Harmony in Sea by Mr. Henry
Moore, A., and the second is Mr. Miller's&mdash;(William not
Joseph
Miller)&mdash;Colonel Hornsby-Drake. This Drake seems out of his
element, as he ought to have been floating about with the wild fowl
that belong naturally to the picture below.

Nos. 63-66.

  
"Four little whitey boys out for a run,
 Ate early greeny food. Then there were none!"
    

Painted by Amy Sawyer. "Not a work of imagination, my dear
little boys, because you were seen by Amy&mdash;that is, Amy saw
yer!"

No. 70. Study in P&acirc;tisserie. Design for a chocolate ornament
covered with sugar. Recommended by Messrs. Clark and
Hamilton.

No. 71. Lion in Desert. Very tame. Mr. Herbert Dicksee.

No. 76. The New Skirt Dance. &there4; We strongly recommend
the study of this picture to admirers of the "Skirt Dance." It
shows how one of the male sex may attempt it&mdash;that is, according to
the idea of the designer, Herbert Dicksee.

No. 88. Colonel W. Barnardiston.
"First Chairman of
West Suffolk County Council."
Painted by Hubert Herkomer,
R.A. If he is "First
Chairman," it doesn't matter
what he is afterwards, since
he has been immortalised by
the admirable painting of
Hubert Herkomer. He'll
remain "First Chairman" in
the Dramatis Person&aelig; of this
year's Catalogue, at all events,
and be H. H.'s "Perpetual
First Chairman," too, be the
other where he may.

No. 103. "Elder Bush."
By H. W. B. Davis, R.A.
From the title you might
expect it to be the portrait of
a Presbyterian "Elder" named "Bush." But it isn't. Look at
it. It is the sweetest, most natural, perfectest of charming "bits"
of rural Nature in the whole show. There's no beating about this
bush; in fact this Elder Bush is one that is very hard to beat.

No. 130. His Grace the Duke of Devonshire. Encore! Bravo,
Mr. Hubert Herkomer. You're are a-going it this year, you are,
Sir! You've given the Duke all his Grace, and there's a kind of
orange tint about him, which, just now, is not without its political
signification.

No. 132. We must go to Kennington (T. B. Kennington) to see
"The Queen of Love." She is sitting on a tiger's skin, and has her
hand on the head of the savage beast, which shows its fangs. "A
fang-see subject," says 'Arry Joker.

No. 158. Honeymooners. "Here we are again!" Same kind of
Stone Fruit from Marcus Stone, R.A. "Sparkles this Stone as it
was wont!"&mdash;Cymbeline. ii., 4. [To be continued in our next.



Among the Immortals at the Royal Academy Banquet Last
Saturday.&mdash;H.R.H. made one of his usually happy speeches; the
Duke of Cambridge, the Earl of Rosebery, and Lord
Herschell
represented the comedy element; while Lord Kelvin and Mr. Leslie
Stephen were perfect in what, theatrically speaking, is termed "the
heavy lead;" and certainly their speeches were&mdash;ahem!&mdash;weighty.
Pretty to note how His Scarlet-robed Eminence entered the room,
not only with a grace all his own, but with His Grace of Canterbury
as well. Never was the President, Sir Frederick Leighton, more
effective in all his speeches, and especially when replying to the toast
of "The Academy," where the perfection of his speech lay in the
subtle concealment of its art, and in the genuine earnestness of his
advice to students urbi et orbi.

ALL-A-BLOWING!

(A Cockney Pastoral in Spring time.)

  
Who-o-o-f! It's hot amost as Summer-time; yet what a blessed breeze
Is a-whiffing round the corners, and a-whoostling through the trees!
And the sunlight on the roof-slates, all aslant to the blue sky,
Seems to twinkle like the larfter in a pooty gurl's blue eye,
When you swing in the dance, and she feels you've got 'er step:
And the trees&mdash;ah! bless their branches!&mdash;through the winter weeks they've slep',
When the worrying winds would let 'em, all as black and mum as mutes,
A-waiting for the blackbirds, with their calls like meller flutes.
Just to whistle them awake like. Oh! but now they stir and rouse
Like a girl who has bin dreamin' of her lover in a drowse,
And wakes up to feel 'is kisses on 'er softly poutin' lips.
How they burst, all a-thirst for the April shower that drips
Tinkle-tink from leaf to leaf, washing every spraylet clean
From the sooty veil of London, which might dim the buddin' green
Of the pluckiest lime-tree, sproutin' o'er brown pales in a back-yard;
For these limes bud betimes, and they find it middlin' hard
To make way at windy corners, when the lamp as lights 'em through,
Like gold on green in pantomimes, is blown till it burns blue,
By the angry nor'east gusts. But the nor'east wind to-day
Is less like a rampin' lion than some new-born lamb at play.
Wy, the laylock's out aready, purple spires and creamy clumps.
Oh, that scent of shower-washed laylock! There's a somethin' in me jumps
As I ketch it round some corner, where the heart-shaped leaflets small
Cluster up against the stucco, as they did about that wall,
Grey, and gritty, and glass-spiked, of our tumble-down old cot
Out Epping way, in boy-time long ago, and quite a lot
Of remembrances came crowding, like good ghostes, in that scent;
There's the mother's call to dinner, there's the landlord's call&mdash;for rent!
And the call of the rooks,&mdash;and another call, fur off,
Like a whisper from a grave-yard, green and silent.
                                       Some may scoff
At a Cockney's chat of laylocks. I could bury my old phiz
In their crisp and nutty coolness, as I did when flirty Liz,
My first sweetheart, sent me packing, one Spring mornin'&mdash;for a while&mdash;
And them blossoms cooled my anger&mdash;most as much as the arch smile
Which won me back to wooin'.
                     There's a blackbird on the top
Of yon tall, half bare acacia, pipes as if he'd never stop,
Tryin' all his tunelets over, like a sort of talking flute:&mdash;
"Chip-chip! Tsee-tsee! Chu-chu! Chu-rook!" goes the bird of sable suit.
"We-know-it! We-know-it! We-know-it! Bring-the-whip!&mdash;the whip!&mdash;the whip!
"Chu-rook-chu-chu! Chu-rook-chu-chu! Tsee-tsee-chu-chu-chip-chip!"
So he pours his pantin' heart out in a song half tune, half patter,
Like a meller music-haller of the tree-tops!
                                     Ah&mdash;what matter
That 'tis only London's outskirts, that I'm a poor Cockney cove,
When this Wondrous Spring is on us? As my shallow on I shove,
And blare out my "All-a-blowing, All-a-growing!" down the streets,
There's a something fresh and shining-like in every face I meets!
Tis the Spring-love breaking through them! Wy, the very dirt looks clean
In the shimmer of the sunlight, and the shadow of the green.
All-a-blowing! All-a-growing! When I shout, I seem to sing,
For my cry takes on a music. It's the very Voice of Spring!
    




"MEAT FOR YOUR MASTER!"

"We shall only be Two to-night; Cook&mdash;your Master and
Me&mdash;so all we shall want will be Soup and Fish and Lamb
and Asparagus, with a Souffl&eacute; to follow, and a little Sweet-bread
after the Fish, you know!"

"Yes, Ma'am. And for the Kitchen?"

"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;there's some of that Potted Ham still left
we had for Breakfast yesterday. It's just on the turn, you
know, so you may as well finish it Downstairs. It will do
very well for your Dinner to-day, and To-morrow you shall
each have an Egg!" 



THE DEARTH OF GENIUSES.

(Dedicated to the Right Hon. A. J.
Balfour.)

  
Cried Genius A. to Genius B., "Let's summon Genius C.,
And, to make a partie carr&eacute;e, we will call in Genius D."
And when they were assembled these solemn four sat down,
And they all read Mr. Balfour's speech, and read it with a frown.
  
Said Genius A., "No Geniuses? By Heaven, he's talking rot!"
And Genius B. replied thereto, "I can't say he is not."
And C. and D., the poets, who warble like the birds,
Agreed with Genius A. and B. in scorning Balfour's words.
  
"A Genius may arise, he says; that's coming it too strong;
Why, dash it, I can count up three in prose and eke in song!"
Thus A. began; the three replied, "You're not an egoist;
You quite forgot to add yourself, and so complete the list."
  
"We'll prove it on the spot," declared dramatic Genius A.
"You three shall sit as judges, and I will read my play.
'Tis a drama of the passions, all strictly based on facts,
And they break the Decalogue to bits in five exhaustive Acts."
  
"That might be good," said B.; "but I've a little thing, I guess,
Which ought to take precedence, a novel in MS.;
With characters so deftly drawn in all their changing scenes,
That Thackeray and Dickens must be knocked to smithereens."
  
But C. broke in; his hair was long, his eyes were very wild,
He was in truth a strangely-garbed and most poetic child;
Said he, "Your plays and novels may all be very well,
But I've an epic poem here on Happiness in Hell."
  
And D., the pretty lyricist, he hummed and then he hawed,
"I've half a hundred sonnets here to Mabel, Madge, and Maud.
I'll read them first, and then I'll read"&mdash;the other three grew pale&mdash;
"My last new book, The Musings of a Town-bred Nightingale."
  
*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
  
And so they sat, and talked and talked, the argument waxed hot,
For each one was a Genius born, and none would budge a jot.
And till they settle who begins, and which of them shall yield,
I fear the "dearth of Geniuses"&mdash;see speech&mdash;must hold the field.
    



Rather a Long Shot.&mdash;How to "attempt the life of the
Premier." Discharge a revolver in the neighbourhood of Downing
Street, and listen to the report in the evening papers.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
