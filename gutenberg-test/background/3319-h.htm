      Preface.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sixteen of these Letters, which were written at the suggestion of the
      editor of the 'St. James's Gazette,' appeared in that journal, from which
      they are now reprinted, by the editor's kind permission. They have been
      somewhat emended, and a few additions have been made. The Letters to
      Horace, Byron, Isaak Walton, Chapelain, Ronsard, and Theocritus have not
      been published before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gem published for the first time on the title-page is a red cornelian
      in the British Museum, probably Graeco-Roman, and treated in an archaistic
      style. It represents Hermes Psychogogos, with a Soul, and has some
      likeness to the Baptism of Our Lord, as usually shown in art. Perhaps it
      may be post-Christian. The gem was selected by Mr. A. S. Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, perhaps, superfluous to add that some of the Letters are written
      rather to suit the Correspondent than to express the writer's own taste or
      opinions. The Epistle to Lord Byron, especially, is 'writ in a manner
      which is my aversion.'

    <h2>
      I. To W. M. Thackeray.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;There are many things that stand in the way of the critic when
      he has a mind to praise the living. He may dread the charge of writing
      rather to vex a rival than to exalt the subject of his applause. He shuns
      the appearance of seeking the favour of the famous, and would not
      willingly be regarded as one of the many parasites who now advertise each
      movement and action of contemporary genius. 'Such and such men of letters
      are passing their summer holidays in the Val d'Aosta,' or the Mountains of
      the Moon, or the Suliman Range, as it may happen. So reports our literary
      'Court Circular,' and all our <i>Précieuses</i> read the tidings with
      enthusiasm. Lastly, if the critic be quite new to the world of letters, he
      may superfluously fear to vex a poet or a novelist by the abundance of his
      eulogy. No such doubts perplex us when, with all our hearts, we would
      commend the departed; for they have passed almost beyond the reach even of
      envy; and to those pale cheeks of theirs no commendation can bring the
      red.
    </p>
    <p>
      You, above all others, were and remain without a rival in your many-sided
      excellence, and praise of you strikes at none of those who have survived
      your day. The increase of time only mellows your renown, and each year
      that passes and brings you no successor does but sharpen the keenness of
      our sense of loss. In what other novelist, since Scott was worn down by
      the burden of a forlorn endeavour, and died for honour's sake, has the
      world found so many of the fairest gifts combined? If we may not call you
      a poet (for the first of English writers of light verse did not seek that
      crown), who that was less than a poet ever saw life with a glance so keen
      as yours, so steady, and so sane? Your pathos was never cheap, your
      laughter never forced; your sigh was never the pulpit trick of the
      preacher. Your funny people&mdash;your Costigans and Fokers&mdash;were not
      mere characters of trick and catch-word, were not empty comic masks.
      Behind each the human heart was beating; and ever and again we were
      allowed to see the features of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus fiction in your hands was not simply a profession, like another, but
      a constant reflection of the whole surface of life: a repeated echo of its
      laughter and its complaint. Others have written, and not written badly,
      with the stolid professional regularity of the clerk at his desk; you,
      like the Scholar Gipsy, might have said that 'it needs heaven-sent moments
      for this skill.' There are, it will not surprise you, some honourable
      women and a few men who call you a cynic; who speak of 'the withered world
      of Thackerayan satire;' who think your eyes were ever turned to the sordid
      aspects of life&mdash;to the mother-in-law who threatens to 'take away her
      silver bread-basket;' to the intriguer, the sneak, the termagant; to the
      Beckys, and Barnes Newcomes, and Mrs. Mackenzies of this world. The
      quarrel of these sentimentalists is really with life, not with you; they
      might as wisely blame Monsieur Buffon because there are snakes in his
      Natural History. Had you not impaled certain noxious human insects, you
      would have better pleased Mr. Ruskin; had you confined yourself to such
      performances, you would have been more dear to the Neo-Balzacian school in
      fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are accused of never having drawn a good woman who was not a doll, but
      the ladies that bring this charge seldom remind us either of Lady
      Castlewood or of Theo or Hetty Lambert. The best women can pardon you
      Becky Sharp and Blanche Amory; they find it harder to forgive you Emmy
      Sedley and Helen Pendennis. Yet what man does not know in his heart that
      the best women&mdash;God bless them&mdash;lean, in their characters,
      either to the sweet passiveness of Emmy or to the sensitive and jealous
      affections of Helen? 'Tis Heaven, not you, that made them so; and they are
      easily pardoned, both for being a very little lower than the angels and
      for their gentle ambition to be painted, as by Guido or Guercino, with
      wings and harps and haloes. So ladies have occasionally seen their own
      faces in the glass of fancy, and, thus inspired, have drawn Romola and
      Consuelo. Yet when these fair idealists, Mdme. Sand and George Eliot,
      designed Rosamund Vincy and Horace, was there not a spice of malice in the
      portraits which we miss in your least favourable studies?
    </p>
    <p>
      That the creator of Colonel Newcome and of Henry Esmond was a snarling
      cynic; that he who designed Rachel Esmond could not draw a good woman:
      these are the chief charges (all indifferent now to you, who were once so
      sensitive) that your admirers have to contend against. A French critic, M.
      Taine, also protests that you do preach too much. Did any author but
      yourself so frequently break the thread (seldom a strong thread) of his
      plot to converse with his reader and moralise his tale, we also might be
      offended. But who that loves Montaigne and Pascal, who that likes the wise
      trifling of the one and can bear with the melancholy of the other, but
      prefers your preaching to another's playing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Your thoughts come in, like the intervention of the Greek Chorus, as an
      ornament and source of fresh delight. Like the songs of the Chorus, they
      bid us pause a moment over the wider laws and actions of human fate and
      human life, and we turn from your persons to yourself, and again from
      yourself to your persons, as from the odes of Sophocles or Aristophanes to
      the action of their characters on the stage. Nor, to my taste, does the
      mere music and melancholy dignity of your style in these passages of
      meditation fall far below the highest efforts of poetry. I remember that
      scene where Clive, at Barnes Newcome's Lecture on the Poetry of the
      Affections, sees Ethel who is lost to him. 'And the past and its dear
      histories, and youth and its hopes and passions, and tones and looks for
      ever echoing in the heart and present in the memory&mdash;these, no doubt,
      poor Clive saw and heard as he looked across the great gulf of time, and
      parting and grief, and beheld the wonmn he had loved for many years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>For ever echoing in the heart and present in the memory:</i> who has
      not heard these tones, who does not hear them as he turns over your books
      that, for so many years, have been his companions and comforters? We have
      been young and old, we have been sad and merry with you, we have listened
      to the mid-night chimes with Pen and Warrington, have stood with you
      beside the death-bed, have mourned at that yet more awful funeral of lost
      love, and with you have prayed in the inmost chapel sacred to our old and
      immortal affections, <i>a' léal souvenir!</i> And whenever you speak for
      yourself, and speak in earnest, how magical, how rare, how lonely in our
      literature is the beauty of your sentences! 'I can't express the charm of
      them' (so you write of George Sand; so we may write of you): 'they seem to
      me like the sound of country bells, provoking I don't know what vein of
      music and meditation, and falling sweetly and sadly on the ear.' Surely
      that style, so fresh, so rich, so full of surprises&mdash;that style which
      stamps as classical your fragments of slang, and perpetually astonishes
      and delights&mdash;would alone give immortality to an author, even had he
      little to say. But you, with your whole wide world of fops and fools, of
      good women and brave men, of honest absurdities and cheery adventurers:
      you who created the Steynes and Newcomes, the Beckys and Blanches, Captain
      Costigan and F. B., and the Chevalier Strong&mdash;all that host of
      friends imperishable&mdash;you must survive with Shakespeare and Cervantes
      in the memory and affection of men.

    <h2>
      II. To Charles Dickens.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;It has been said that every man is born a Platonist or an
      Aristotelian, though the enormous majority of us, to be sure, live and die
      without being conscious of any invidious philosophic partiality whatever.
      With more truth (though that does not imply very much) every Englishman
      who reads may be said to be a partisan of yourself or of Mr. Thackeray.
      Why should there be any partisanship in the matter; and why, having two
      such good things as your novels and those of your contemporary, should we
      not be silently happy in the possession? Well, men are made so, and must
      needs fight and argue over their tastes in enjoyment. For myself, I may
      say that in this matter I am what the Americans do not call a 'Mugwump,'
      what English politicians dub a 'superior person'&mdash;that is, I take no
      side, and attempt to enjoy the best of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be owned that this attitude is sometimes made a little difficult
      by the vigour of your special devotees. They have ceased, indeed, thank
      Heaven! to imitate you; and even in 'descriptive articles' the touch of
      Mr. Gigadibs, of him whom 'we almost took for the true Dickens,' has
      disappeared. The young lions of the Press no longer mimic your less
      admirable mannerisms&mdash;do not strain so much after fantastic
      comparisons, do not (in your manner and Mr. Carlyle's) give people
      nick-names derived from their teeth, or their complexion; and, generally,
      we are spared second-hand copies of all that in your style was least to be
      commended. But, though improved by lapse of time in this respect, your
      devotees still put on little conscious airs of virtue, robust manliness,
      and so forth, which would have irritated you very much, and there survive
      some press men who seem to have read you a little (especially your later
      works), and never to have read anything else. Now familiarity with the
      pages of 'Our Mutual Friend'and 'Dombey and Son' does not precisely
      constitute a liberal education, and the assumption that it does is apt
      (quite unreasonably) to prejudice people against the greatest comic genius
      of modern times.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Time is at last beginning to sift the true admirers of
      Dickens from the false. Yours, Sir, in the best sense of the word, is a
      popular success, a popular reputation. For example, I know that, in a
      remote and even Pictish part of this kingdom, a rural household, humble
      and under the shadow of a sorrow inevitably approaching, has found in
      'David Copperfield' oblivion of winter, of sorrow, and of sickness. On the
      other hand, people are now picking up heart to say that 'they cannot read
      Dickens,' and that they particularly detest 'Pickwick.' I believe it was
      young ladies who first had the courage of their convictions in this
      respect. 'Tout sied aux belles,' and the fair, in the confidence of youth,
      often venture on remarkable confessions. In your 'Natural History of Young
      Ladies' I do not remember that you describe the Humorous Young Lady (1).
      She is a very rare bird indeed, and humour generally is at a deplorably
      low level in England.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1)   I am informed that the <i>Natural History of Young
     Ladies</i> is attributed, by some writers, to another
     philosopher, the author of <i>The Art of Pluck</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Hence come all sorts of mischief, arisen since you left us; and, it may be
      said, that inordinate philanthropy, genteel sympathy with Irish murder and
      arson, Societies for Badgering the Poor, Esoteric Buddhism, and a score of
      other plagues, including what was once called Aestheticism, are all,
      primarily, due to want of humour. People discuss, with the gravest faces,
      matters which properly should only be stated as the wildest paradoxes. It
      naturally follows that, in a period almost destitute of humour, many
      respectable persons 'cannot read Dickens,' and are not ashamed to glory in
      their shame. We ought not to be angry with others for their misfortunes;
      and yet when one meets the <i>crétins</i> who boast that they cannot read
      Dickens, one certainly does feel much as Mr. Samuel Weller felt when he
      encountered Mr. Job Trotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      How very singular has been the history of the decline of humour. Is there
      any profound psychological truth to be gathered from consideration of the
      fact that humour has gone out with cruelty? A hundred years ago, eighty
      years ago&mdash;nay, fifty years ago&mdash;we were a cruel but also a
      humorous people. We had bull-baitings, and badger-drawings, and hustings,
      and prize-fights, and cock-fights; we went to see men hanged; the pillory
      and the stocks were no empty 'terrors unto evil-doers,' for there was
      commonly a malefactor occupying each of these institutions. With all this
      we had a broad blown comic sense. We had Ho-garth, and Bunbury, and George
      Cruikshank, and Gilray; we had Leech and Surtees, and the creator of
      Tittlebat Titmouse; we had the Shepherd of the 'Noctes,' and, above all,
      we had <i>you</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the old giants of English fun&mdash;burly persons delighting in broad
      caricature, in decided colours, in cockney jokes, in swashing blows at the
      more prominent and obvious human follies&mdash;from these you derived the
      splendid high spirits and unhesitating mirth of your earlier works. Mr.
      Squeers, and Sam Weller, and Mrs. Gamp, and all the Pickwickians, and Mr.
      Dowler, and John Browdie&mdash;these and their immortal companions were
      reared, so to speak, on the beef and beer of that naughty, fox-hunting,
      badger-baiting old England, which we have improved out of existence. And
      these characters, assuredly, are your best; by them, though stupid people
      cannot read about them, you will live while there is a laugh left among
      us. Perhaps that does not assure you a very prolonged existence, but only
      the future can show.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dismal seriousness of the time cannot, let us hope, last for ever and
      a day. Honest old Laughter, the true <i>lutin</i> of your inspiration,
      must have life left in him yet, and cannot die; though it is true that the
      taste for your pathos, and your melodrama, and plots constructed after
      your favourite fashion ('Great Expectations' and the 'Tale of Two Cities'
      are exceptions) may go by and never be regretted. Were people simpler, or
      only less clear-sighted, as far as your pathos is concerned, a generation
      ago? Jeffrey, the hard-headed shallow critic, who declared that Wordsworth
      'would never do,' cried, 'wept like anything,' over your Little Nell. One
      still laughs as heartily as ever with Dick Swiveller; but who can cry over
      Little Nell?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, Sir, how could you&mdash;who knew so intimately, who remembered so
      strangely well the fancies, the dreams, the sufferings of childhood&mdash;how
      could you 'wallow naked in the pathetic,' and massacre holocausts of the
      Innocents? To draw tears by gloating over a child's death-bed, was it
      worthy of you? Was it the kind of work over which our hearts should melt?
      I confess that Little Nell might die a dozen times, and be welcomed by
      whole legions of Angels, and I (like the bereaved fowl mentioned by Pet
      Marjory) would remain unmoved.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  She was more than usual calm,
  She did not give a single dam,

    <p>
      wrote the astonishing child who diverted the leisure of Scott. Over your
      Little Nell and your Little Dombey I remain more than usual calm; and
      probably so do thousands of your most sincere admirers. But about matter
      of this kind, and the unsealing of the fountains of tears, who can argue?
      Where is taste? where is truth? What tears are 'manly, Sir, manly,' as
      Fred Bayham has it; and of what lamentations ought we rather to be
      ashamed? <i>Sunt lacrymae rerum</i>; one has been moved in the cell where
      Socrates tasted the hemlock; or by the river-banks where Syracusan arrows
      slew the parched Athenians among the mire and blood; or, in fiction, when
      Colonel Newcome said <i>Adsum</i>, or over the diary of Clare Doria Forey,
      or where Aramis laments, with strange tears, the death of Porthos. But
      over Dombey (the Son), or Little Nell, one declines to snivel.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an author deliberately sits down and says, 'Now, let us have a good
      cry,' he poisons the wells of sensibility and chokes, at least in many
      breasts, the fountain of tears. Out of 'Dombey and Son' there is little we
      care to remember except the deathless Mr. Toots; just as we forget the
      melodramatics of 'Martin Chuzzlewit.' I have read in that book a score of
      times; I never see it but I revel in it&mdash;in Pecksniff, and Mrs. Gamp,
      and the Americans. But what the plot is all about, what Jonas did, what
      Montagu Tigg had to make in the matter, what all the pictures with plenty
      of shading illustrate, I have never been able to comprehend. In the same
      way, one of your most thorough-going admirers has allowed (in the licence
      of private conversation) that 'Ralph Nickleby and Monk are too steep;' and
      probably a cultivated taste will always find them a little precipitous.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Too steep:'&mdash;the slang expresses that defect of an ardent genius,
      carried above itself, and out of the air we breathe, both in its grotesque
      and in its gloomy imaginations. To force the note, to press fantasy too
      hard, to deepen the gloom with black over the indigo, that was the failing
      which proved you mortal. To take an instance in little: when Pip went to
      Mr. Pumblechook's, the boy thought the seedsman 'a very happy man to have
      so many little drawers in his shop.' The reflection is thoroughly boyish;
      but then you add, 'I wondered whether the flower-seeds and bulbs ever
      wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails and bloom.' That is not
      boyish at all; that is the hard-driven, jaded literary fancy at work.

    <p>
      'So we arraign her; but she,' the Genius of Charles Dickens, how
      brilliant, how kindly, how beneficent she is! dwelling by a fountain of
      laughter imperishable; though there is something of an alien salt in the
      neighbouring fountain of tears. How poor the world of fancy would be, how
      'dispeopled of her dreams,' if, in some ruin of the social system, the
      books of Dickens were lost; and if The Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Mr.
      Crinkle, and Miss Squeers, and Sam Weller, and Mrs. Gamp, and Dick
      Swiveller were to perish, or to vanish with Menander's men and women! We
      cannot think of our world without them; and, children of dreams as they
      are, they seem more essential than great statesmen, artists, soldiers, who
      have actually worn flesh and blood, ribbons and orders, gowns and
      uniforms. May we not almost welcome 'Free Education'? for every Englishman
      who can read, unless he be an Ass, is a reader the more for you.

      III. To Pierre de Ronsard (Prince of Poets.)
    </h2>
    <p>
      Master and Prince of Poets,&mdash;As we know what choice thou madest of a
      sepulchre (a choice how ill fulfilled by the jealousy of Fate), so we know
      well the manner of thy chosen immortality. In the Plains Elysian, among
      the heroes and the ladies of old song, there was thy Love with thee to
      enjoy her paradise in an eternal spring.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  La' du plaisant Avril la saison imortelle
   Sans eschange le suit,
  La terre sans labeur, de sa grasse mamelle,
   Tout chose y produit;
  D'enbas la troupe sainte autrefois amoureuse,
   Nous honorant sur tous,
  Viendra nous saluer, s'estimant bien-heureuse
   De s'accointer de nous.
</pre>
    <p>
      There thou dwellest, with the learned lovers of old days, with Belleau,
      and Du Bellay, and Bai'f, and the flower of the maidens of Anjou. Surely
      no rumour reaches thee, in that happy place of reconciled affections, no
      rumour of the rudeness of Time, the despite of men, and the change which
      stole from thy locks, so early grey, the crown of laurels and of thine own
      roses. How different from thy choice of a sepulchre have been the fortunes
      of thy tomb!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I will that none should break
  The marble for my sake,
  Wishful to make more fair
    My sepulchre.

 So didst thou sing, or so thy sweet numbers run in my rude English. Wearied
of Courts and of priories, thou didst desire a grave beside thine own
Loire, not remote from

  The caves, the founts that fall
  From the high mountain wall,
   That fall and flash and fleet,
    Wilh silver fret.

  Only a laurel tree
  Shall guard the grave of me;
   Only Apollo's bough
    Shall shade me now!

 Far other has been thy sepulchre: not in the free air, among the field
flowers, but in thy priory of Saint Cosme, with marble for a monument,
and no green grass to cover thee. Restless wert thou in thy life; thy
dust was not to be restful in thy death. The Huguenots, <i>ces nouveaux
Chrétiens qui la France ont pillée</i>, destroyed thy tomb, and the warning
of the later monument,

 ABI, NEFASTE, QUAM CALCAS HUMUM SACRA EST,
</pre>
    <p>
      has not scared away malicious men. The storm that passed over France a
      hundred years ago, more terrible than the religious wars that thou didst
      weep for, has swept the column from the tomb. The marble was broken by
      violent hands, and the shattered sepulchre of the Prince of Poets gained a
      dusty hospitality from the museum of a country town. Better had been the
      laurel of thy desire, the creeping vine, and the ivy tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarce more fortunate, for long, than thy monument was thy memory. Thou
      hast not encountered, Master, in the Paradise of Poets, Messieurs
      Malherbe, De Balzac, and Boileau&mdash;Boileau who spoke of thee as <i>Ce
      poéte orgueilleux trébuché de si haut!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      These gallant gentlemen, I make no doubt, are happy after their own
      fashion, backbiting each other and thee in the Paradise of Critics. In
      their time they wrought thee much evil, grumbling that thou wrotest in
      Greek and Latin (of which tongues certain of them had but little skill),
      and blaming thy many lyric melodies and the free flow of thy lines. What
      said M. de Balzac to M. Chapelain? 'M. de Malherbe, M. de Grasse, and
      yourself must be very little poets, if Ronsard be a great one.' Time has
      brought in his revenges, and Messieurs Chapelain and De Grasse are as well
      forgotten as thou art well remembered. Men could not always be deaf to thy
      sweet old songs, nor blind to the beauty of thy roses and thy loves. When
      they took the wax out of their ears that M. Boileau had given them lest
      they should hear the singing of thy Sirens, then they were deaf no longer,
      then they heard the old deaf poet singing and made answer to his lays.
      Hast thou not heard these sounds? have they not reached thee, the voices
      and the lyres of Théophile Gautier and Alfred de Musset? Methinks thou
      hast marked them, and been glad that the old notes were ringing again and
      the old French lyric measures tripping to thine ancient harmonies, echoing
      and replying to the Muses of Horace and Catullus. Returning to Nature,
      poets returned to thee. Thy monument has perished, but not thy music, and
      the Prince of Poets has returned to his own again in a glorious
      Restoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the dust and smoke of ages, and through the centuries of wars we
      strain our eyes and try to gain a glimpse of thee, Master, in thy good
      days, when the Muses walked with thee. We seem to mark thee wandering
      silent through some little village, or dreaming in the woods, or loitering
      among thy lonely places, or in gardens where the roses blossom among
      wilder flowers, or on river banks where the whispering poplars and sighing
      reeds make answer to the murmur of the waters. Such a picture hast thou
      drawn of thyself in the summer afternoons.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Je m'en vais pourmener tantost parmy la plaine,

    <p>
      Still, methinks, there was a book in the hand of the grave and learned
      poet; still thou wouldst carry thy Horace, thy Catullus, thy Theocritus,
      through the gem-like weather of the <i>Renouveau</i>, when the woods were
      enamelled with flowers, and the young Spring was lodged, like a wandering
      prince, in his great palaces hung with green:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Orgueilleux de ses fleurs, enflé de sa jeunesse,
  Logé comme un grand Prince en ses vertes maisons!

    <p>
      Thou sawest, in these woods by Loire side, the fair shapes of old
      religion, Fauns, Nymphs, and Satyrs, and heard'st in the nightingale's
      music the plaint of Philomel. The ancient poets came back in the train of
      thyself and of the Spring, and learning was scarce less dear to thee than
      love; and thy ladies seemed fairer for the names they borrowed from the
      beauties of forgotten days, Helen and Cassandra. How sweetly didst thou
      sing to them thine old morality, and how gravely didst thou teach the
      lesson of the Roses! Well didst thou know it, well didst thou love the
      Rose, since thy nurse, carrying thee, an infant, to the holy font, let
      fall on thee the sacred water brimmed with floating blossoms of the Rose!
    </p>

      In the same mood, looking far down the future, thou sangest of thy lady's
      age, the most sad, the most beautiful of thy sad and beautiful lays; for
      if thy bees gathered much honey 't was somewhat bitter to taste, as that
      of the Sardinian yews. How clearly we see the great hall, the grey lady
      spinning and humming among her drowsy maids, and how they waken at the
      word, and she sees her spring in their eyes, and they forecast their
      winter in her face, when she murmurs ''Twas Ronsard sang of me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Winter, and summer, and spring, how swiftly they pass, and how early time
      brought thee his sorrows, and grief cast her dust upon thy head.

      Wine, and a soft bed, and a bright fire: to this trinity of poor pleasures
      we come soon, if, indeed, wine be left to us. Poetry herself deserts us;
      is it not said that Bacchus never forgives a renegade? and most of us turn
      recreants to Bacchus. Even the bright fire, I fear, was not always there
      to warm thine old blood, Master, or, if fire there were, the wood was not
      bought with thy book-seller's money. When autumn was drawing in during
      thine early old age, in 1584, didst thou not write that thou hadst never
      received a sou at the hands of all the publishers who vended thy books?
      And as thou wert about putting forth the folio edition of 1584, thou didst
      pray Buon, the bookseller, to give thee sixty crowns to buy wood withal,
      and make thee a bright fire in winter weather, and comfort thine old age
      with thy friend Gallandius. And if Buon will not pay, then to try the
      other book-sellers, 'that wish to take everything and give nothing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it knowledge of this passage, Master, or ignorance of everything else,
      that made certain of the common steadfast dunces of our days speak of thee
      as if thou hadst been a starveling, neglected poetaster, jealous forsooth,
      of Maitre Francoys Rabelais? See how ignorantly M. Fleury writes, who
      teaches French literature withal to them of Muscovy, and hath indited a
      Life of Rabelais. 'Rabelais était revétu d'un emploi honorable; Ronsard
      était traité en subalterne,' quoth this wondrous professor. What! Pierre
      de Ronsard, a gentleman of a noble house, holding the revenue of many
      abbeys, the friend of Mary Stuart, of the Duc d'Orléans, of Charles IX.,
      <i>he</i> is <i>traité en subalterne</i>, and is jealous of a frocked or
      unfrocked <i>manant</i> like Maitre Francoys! And then this amazing Fleury
      falls foul of thine epitaph on Mai'tre Francoys and cries, 'Ronsard a
      voulu faire des vers méchants; il n'a fait que de méchants vers.' More
      truly saith M. Sainte-Beuve, 'If the good Rabelais had returned to Meudon
      on the day when this epitaph was made over the wine, he would, methinks,
      have laughed heartily.' But what shall be said of a Professor like the
      egregious M. Fleury, who holds that Ronsard was despised at Court? Was
      there a party at tennis when the king would not fain have had thee on his
      side, declaring that he ever won when Ronsard was his partner? Did he not
      give thee benefices, and many priories, and call thee his father in
      Apollo, and even, so they say, bid thee sit down beside him on his throne?
      Away, ye scandalous folk, who tell us that there was strife between the
      Prince of Poets and the King of Mirth. Naught have ye by way of proof of
      your slander but the talk of Jean Bernier, a scurrilous, starveling
      apothecary, who put forth his fables in 1697, a century and a half after
      Mai'tre Francoys died. Bayle quoted this fellow in a note, and ye all
      steal the tattle one from another in your dull manner, and know not whence
      it comes, nor even that Bayle would none of it and mocked its author. With
      so little knowledge is history written, and thus doth each chattering
      brook of a 'Life swell with its tribute, that great Mississippi of
      falsehood,' Biography.

    <h2>
      IV. To Herodotus.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To Herodotus of Halicarnassus, greeting.&mdash;Concerning the matters set
      forth in your histories, and the tales you tell about both Greeks and
      barbarians, whether they be true, or whether they be false, men dispute
      not little but a great deal. Wherefore I, being concerned to know the
      verity, did set forth to make search in every manner, and came in my quest
      even unto the ends of the earth. For there is an island of the Cimmerians
      beyond the Straits of Heracles, some three days' voyage to a ship that
      hath a fair following wind in her sails; and there it is said that men
      know many things from of old: thither, then, I came in my inquiry. Now,
      the island is not small, but large, greater than the whole of Hellas; and
      they call it Britain. In that island the east wind blows for ten parts of
      the year, and the people know not how to cover themselves from the cold.
      But for the other two months of the year the sun shines fiercely, so that
      some of them die thereof, and others die of the frozen mixed drinks; for
      they have ice even in the summer, and this ice they put to their liquor.
      Through the whole of this island, from the west even to the east, there
      flows a river called Thames: a great river and a laborious, but not to be
      likened to the River of Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mouth of this river, where I stepped out from my ship, is exceedingly
      foul and of an evil savour by reason of the city on the banks. Now this
      city is several hundred parasangs in circumference. Yet a man that needed
      not to breathe the air might go round it in one hour, in chariots that run
      under the earth; and these chariots are drawn by creatures that breathe
      smoke and sulphur, such as Orpheus mentions in his 'Argonautica,' if it be
      by Orpheus. The people of the town, when I inquired of them concerning
      Herodotus of Halicarnassus, looked on me with amazement, and went
      straightway about their business,&mdash;namely, to seek out whatsoever new
      thing is coming to pass all over the whole inhabited world, and as for
      things old, they take no keep of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, by diligence I learned that he who in this land knew most
      concerning Herodotus was a priest, and dwelt in the priests' city on the
      river which is called the City of the Ford of the Ox. But whether Io, when
      she wore a cow's shape, had passed by that way in her wanderings, and
      thence comes the name of that city, I could not (though I asked all men I
      met) learn aught with certainty. But to me, considering this, it seemed
      that Io must have come thither. And now farewell to Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the City of the Priests there are two roads: one by land; and one by
      water, following the river. To a well-girdled man, the land journey is but
      one day's travel; by the river it is longer but more pleasant. Now that
      river flows, as I said, from the west to the east. And there is in it a
      fish called chub, which they catch; but they do not eat it, for a certain
      sacred reason. Also there is a fish called trout, and this is the manner
      of his catching. They build far this purpose great dams of wood, which
      they call weirs. Having built the weir they sit upon it with rods in their
      hands, and a line on the rod, and at the end of the line a little fish.
      There then they 'sit and spin in the sun,' as one of their poets says, not
      for a short time but for many days, having rods in their hands and eating
      and drinking. In this wise they angle for the fish called trout; but
      whether they ever catch him or not, not having seen it, I cannot say; for
      it is not pleasant to me to speak things concerning which I know not the
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, after sailing and rowing against the stream for certain days, I came
      to the City of the Ford of the Ox. Here the river changes his name, and is
      called Isis, after the name of the goddess of the Egyptians. But whether
      the Britons brought the name from Egypt or whether the Egyptians took it
      from the Britons, not knowing I prefer not to say. But to me it seems that
      the Britons are a colony of the Egyptians, or the Egyptians a colony of
      the Britons. Moreover, when I was in Egypt I saw certain soldiers in white
      helmets, who were certainly British. But what they did there (as Egypt
      neither belongs to Britain nor Britain to Egypt) I know not, neither could
      they tell me. But one of them replied to me in that line of Homer (if the
      Odyssey be Homer's), 'We have come to a sorry Cyprus, and a sad Egypt.'
      Others told me that they once marched against the Ethiopians, and having
      defeated them several times, then came back again, leaving their property
      to the Ethiopians. But as to the truth of this I leave it to every man to
      form his own opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having come into the City of the Priests, I went forth into the street,
      and found a priest of the baser sort, who for a piece of silver led me
      hither and thither among the temples, discoursing of many things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it seemed to me a strange thing that the city was empty, and no man
      dwelling therein, save a few priests only, and their wives, and their
      children, who are drawn to and fro in little carriages dragged by women,
      but the priest told me that during half the year the city was desolate,
      for that there came somewhat called 'The Long,' or 'The Vac,' and drave
      out the young priests. And he said that these did no other thing but row
      boats, and throw balls from one to the other, and this they were made to
      do, he said, that the young priests might learn to be humble, for they are
      the proudest of men. But whether he spoke truth or not I know not, only I
      set down what he told me. But to anyone considering it, this appears
      rather to jump with his story&mdash;namely, that the young priests have
      houses on the river, painted of divers colours, all of them empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the priest, at my desire, brought me to one of the temples, that I
      might seek out all things concerning Herodotus the Halicarnassian, from
      one who knew. Now this temple is not the fairest in the city, but less
      fair and goodly than the old temples, yet goodlier and more fair than the
      new temples; and over the roof there is the image of an eagle made of
      stone&mdash;no small marvel, but a great one, how men came to fashion him;
      and that temple is called the House of Queens. Here they sacrifice a boar
      once every year; and concerning this they tell a certain sacred story
      which I know but will not utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I was brought to the priest who had a name for knowing most about
      Egypt, and the Egyptians, and the Assyrians, and the Cappadocians, and all
      the kingdoms of the Great King. He came out to me, being attired in a
      black robe, and wearing on his head a square cap. But why the priests have
      square caps I know, and he who has been initiated into the mysteries which
      they call 'Matric' knows, but I prefer not to tell. Concerning the square
      cap, then, let this be sufficient. Now, the priest received me
      courteously, and when I asked him, concerning Herodotus, whether he were a
      true man or not, he smiled, and answered 'Abu Goosh,' which, in the tongue
      of the Arabians, means 'The Father of Liars.' Then he went on to speak
      concerning Herodotus, and he said in his discourse that Herodotus not only
      told the thing which was not, but that he did so wilfully, as one knowing
      the truth but concealing it. For example, quoth he, 'Solon never went to
      see Croesus, as Herodotus avers; nor did those about Xerxes ever dream
      dreams; but Herodotus, out of his abundant wickedness, invented these
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now behold,' he went on, 'how the curse of the Gods falls upon Herodotus.
      For he pretends that he saw Cadmeian inscriptions at Thebes. Now I do not
      believe there were any Cadmeian inscriptions there: therefore Herodotus is
      most manifestly lying. Moreover, this Herodotus never speaks of Sophocles
      the Athenian, and why not? Because he, being a child at school, did not
      learn Sophocles by heart: for the tragedies of Sophocles could not have
      been learned at school before they were written, nor can any man quote a
      poet whom he never learned at school. Moreover, as all those about
      Herodotus knew Sophocles well, he could not appear to them to be learned
      by showing that he knew what they knew also.' Then I thought the priest
      was making game and sport, saying first that Herodotus could know no poet
      whom he had not learned at school, and then saying that all the men of his
      time well knew this poet, 'about whom everyone was talking'. But the
      priest seemed not to know that Herodotus and Sophocles were friends, which
      is proved by this, that Sophocles wrote an ode in praise of Herodotus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went on, and though I were to write with a hundred hands (like
      Briareus, of whom Homer makes mention) I could not tell you all the things
      that the priest said against Herodotus, speaking truly, or not truly, or
      sometimes correctly and sometimes not, as often befalls mortal men. For
      Herodotus, he said, was chiefly concerned to steal the lore of those who
      came before him, such as Hecataeus, and then to escape notice as having
      stolen it. Also he said that, being himself cunning and deceitful,
      Herodotus was easily beguiled by the cunning of others, and believed in
      things manifestly false, such as the story of the Phoenix-bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I spoke, and said that Herodotus himself declared that he could not
      believe that story; but the priest regarded me not. And he said that
      Herodotus had never caught a crocodile with cold pig, nor did he ever
      visit Assyria, nor Babylon, nor Elephantine; but, saying that he had been
      in these lands, said that which was not true. He also declared that
      Herodotus, when he travelled, knew none of the Fat Ones of the Egyptians,
      but only those of the baser sort. And he called Herodotus a thief and a
      beguiler, and 'the same with intent to deceive,' as one of their own poets
      writes, and, to be short, Herodotus, I could not tell you in one day all
      the charges which are now brought against you; but concerning the truth of
      these things, <i>you</i> know, not least, but most, as to yourself being
      guilty or innocent. Wherefore, if you have anything to show or set forth
      whereby you may be relieved from the burden of these accusations, now is
      the time. Be no more silent; but, whether through the Oracle of the Dead,
      or the Oracle of Branchidae, or that in Delphi, or Dodona, or of
      Amphiaraus at Oropus, speak to your friends and lovers (whereof I am one
      from of old) and let men know the very truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, concerning the priests in the City of the Ford of the Ox, it is to be
      said that of all men whom we know they receive strangers most gladly,
      feasting them all day. Moreover, they have many drinks, cunningly mixed,
      and of these the best is that they call Archdeacon, naming it from one of
      the priests' offices. Truly, as Homer says (if the Odyssey be Homer's),
      'when that draught is poured into the bowl then it is no pleasure to
      refrain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Drinking of this wine, or nectar, Herodotus, I pledge you, and pour forth
      some deal on the ground, to Herodotus of Halicarnassus, in the House of
      Hades.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I wish you farewell, and good be with you. Whether the priest spoke
      truly, or not truly, even so may such good things betide you as befall
      dead men.

      V. Epistle to Mr. Alexander Pope.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  From mortal Gratitude, decide, my Pope,
  Have Wits Immortal more to fear or hope?
  Wits toil and travail round the Plant of Fame,
  Their Works its Garden, and its Growth their Aim,
  Then Commentators, in unwieldy Dance,
  Break down the Barriers of the trim Pleasance,
  Pursue the Poet, like Actaeon's Hounds,
  Beyond the fences of his Garden Grounds,
  Rend from the singing Robes each borrowed gem,
  Rend from the laurel'd Brows the Diadem,
  And, if one Rag of Character they spare,
  Comes the Biographer, and strips it bare!

  Such, Pope, has been thy Fortune, such thy Doom.
  Swift the Ghouls gathered at the Poet's Tomb,
  With Dust of Notes to clog each lordly Line,
  Warburton, Warton, Croker, Bowles, combine!
  Collecting Cackle, Johnson condescends
  To <i>interview</i> the Drudges of your Friends.
  Though still your Courthope holds your merits high,
  And still proclaims your Poems poetry,
  Biographers, un-Boswell-like, have sneered,
  And Dunces edit him whom Dunces feared!

  They say; what say they? Not in vain You ask.
  To tell you what they say, behold my Task!
  'Methinks already I your Tears survey'
  As I repeat 'the horrid Things they say.' (1)

  Not frenzied Dennis smote so fell as he;
  For El&mdash;n's Introduction, crabbed and dry,
  Like Churchill's Cudgel's (2) marked with Lie, and Lie!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'Too dull to know what his own System meant,
  Pope yet was skilled new Treasons to invent;
  A Snake that puffed himself and stung his Friends,
  Few Lied so frequent, for such little Ends;
  His mind, like Flesh inflamed, (3) was raw and sore,
  And still, the more he writhed, he stung the more!
  Oft in a Quarrel, never in the Right,
  His Spirit sank when he was called to fight.
  Pope, in the Darkness mining like a Mole,
  Forged on Himself, as from Himself he stole,
  And what for Caryll once he feigned to feel,
  Transferred, in Letters never sent, to Steele!
  Still he denied the Letters he had writ,
  And still mistook Indecency for Wit.
  His very Grammar, so De Quincey cries,
  "Detains the Reader, and at times defies!"'

  'Some forage Falsehoods from the North and South,
  But Pope, poor D&mdash;-l, lied from Hand to Mouth; (1)
  Affected, hypocritical, and vain,
  A Book in Breeches, and a Fop in Grain;
  A Fox that found not the high Clusters sour,
  The Fanfaron of Vice beyond his power,
  Pope yet possessed'&mdash;(the Praise will make you start)&mdash;
  'Mean, morbid, vain, he yet possessed a Heart!
  And still we marvel at the Man, and still
  Admire his Finish, and applaud his Skill:
  Though, as that fabled Barque, a phantom Form,
  Eternal strains, nor rounds the Cape of Storm,
  Even so Pope strove, nor ever crossed the Line
  That from the Noble separates the Fine!'

  The Learned thus, and who can quite reply,
  Reverse the Judgment, and Retort the Lie?
  You reap, in arméd Hates that haunt Your name,
  Reap what you sowed, the Dragon's Teeth of Fame:
  You could not write, and from unenvious Time
  Expect the Wreath that crowns the lofty Rhyme,
  You still must fight, retreat, attack, defend,
  And oft, to snatch a Laurel, lose a Friend!

  The Pity of it! And the changing Taste
  Of changing Time leaves half your Work a Waste!
  My Childhood fled your couplet's clarion tone,
  And sought for Homer in the Prose of Bohn.
  Still through the Dust of that dim Prose appears
  The Flight of Arrows and the Sheen of Spears;
  Still we may trace what Hearts heroic feel,
  And hear the Bronze that hurtles on the Steel!
  But, ah, your Iliad seems a half-pretence,
  Where Wits, not Heroes, prove their Skill in Fence,
  And great Achilles' Eloquence doth show
  As if no Centaur trained him, but Boileau!
  Again, your Verse is orderly,&mdash;and more,&mdash;
  'The Waves behind impel the Waves before;'
  Monotonously musical they glide,
  Till Couplet unto Couplet hath replied.
  But turn to Homer! How his Verses sweep!
  Surge answers Surge and Deep doth call on Deep;
  This Line in Foam and Thunder issues forth,
  Spurred by the West or smitten by the North,
  Sombre in all its sullen Deeps, and all
  Clear at the Crest, and foaming to the Fall,
  The next with silver Murmur dies away,
  Like Tides that falter to Calypso's Bay!

  Thus Time, with sordid Alchemy and dread,
  Turns half the Glory of your Gold to Lead;
  Thus Time,&mdash;at Ronsard's wreath that vainly bit,&mdash;
  Has marred the Poet to preserve the Wit,
  Who almost left on Addison a stain,
  Whose knife cut cleanest with a poisoned pain,&mdash;
  Yet Thou (strange Fate that clings to all of Thine!)
  When most a Wit dost most a Poet shine.
  In Poetry thy Dunciad expires,
  When Wit has shot 'her momentary Fires.'
  'T is Tragedy that watches by the Bed
  'Where tawdry Yellow strove with dirty Red,'
  And men, remembering all, can scarce deny
  To lay the Laurel where thine Ashes lie!

    <h2>
      VI. To Lucian of Samosata.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In what bower, oh Lucian, of your rediscovered Islands Fortunate are you
      now reclining; the delight of the fair, the learned, the witty, and the
      brave? In that clear and tranquil climate, whose air breathes of 'violet
      and lily, myrtle, and the flower of the vine,'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Where the daisies are rose-scented,
 And the Rose herself has got
 Perfume which on earth is not,
</pre>
    <p>
      among the music of all birds, and the wind-blown notes of flutes hanging
      on the trees, methinks that your laughter sounds most silvery sweet, and
      that Helen and fair Charmides are still of your company. Master of mirth,
      and Soul the best contented of all that have seen the world's ways
      clearly, most clear-sighted of all that have made tranquillity their
      bride, what other laughers dwell with you, where the crystal and fragrant
      waters wander round the shining palaces and the temples of amethyst?
    </p>
    <p>
      Heine surely is with you; if, indeed, it was not one Syrian soul that
      dwelt among alien men, Germans and Romans, in the bodily tabernacles of
      Heine and of Lucian. But he was fallen on evil times and evil tongues;
      while Lucian, as witty as he, as bitter in mockery, as happily dowered
      with the magic of words, lived long and happily and honoured, imprisoned
      in no 'mattress-grave.' Without Rabelais, without Voltaire, without Heine,
      you would find, methinks, even the joys of your Happy Islands lacking in
      zest; and, unless Plato came by your way, none of the ancients could meet
      you in the lists of sportive dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, among the vines that bear twelve times in the year, more excellent
      than all the vineyards of Touraine, while the song-birds bring you flowers
      from vales enchanted, and the shapes of the Blessed come and go, beautiful
      in wind-woven raiment of sunset hues; there, in a land that knows not age
      nor winter, midnight, nor autumn, nor noon, where the silver twilight of
      summer-dawn is perennial, where youth does not wax spectre-pale and die;
      there, my Lucian, you are crowned the Prince of the Paradise of Mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who would bring you, if he had the power, from the banquet where Homer
      sings: Homer, who, in mockery of commentators, past and to come, German
      and Greek, informed you that he was by birth a Babylonian? Yet, if you,
      who first wrote Dialogues of the Dead, could hear the prayer of an epistle
      wafted to 'lands indiscoverable in the unheard-of West,' you might visit
      once more a world so worthy of such a mocker, so like the world you knew
      so well of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, Lucian, we have need of you, of your sense and of your mockery! Here,
      where faith is sick and superstition is waking afresh; where gods come
      rarely, and spectres appear at five shillings an interview; where science
      is popular, and philosophy cries aloud in the market-place, and clamour
      does duty for government, and Thais and Lais are names of power&mdash;here,
      Lucian, is room and scope for you. Can I not imagine a new 'Auction of
      Philosophers,' and what wealth might be made by him who bought these
      popular sages and lecturers at his estimate, and vended them at their own?
    </p>
    <p>
      HERMES: Whom shall we put first up to auction?
    </p>
    <p>
      ZEUS: That German in spectacles; he seems a highly respectable man.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERMES: Ho, pessimist, come down and let the public view you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZEUS: Go on, put him up and have done with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERMES: Who bids for the Life Miserable, for extreme, complete, perfect,
      unredeemable perdition? What offers for the universal extinction of the
      species, and the collapse of the Conscious?
    </p>
    <p>
      A PURCHASER: He does not look at all a bad lot. May one put him through
      his paces?
    </p>
    <p>
      HERMES: Certainly; try your luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      PURCHASER: What is your name?
    </p>
    <p>
      PESSIMIST: Hartmann.
    </p>
    <p>
      PURCHASER: What can you teach me?
    </p>
    <p>
      PESSIMIST: That Life is not worth Living.
    </p>
    <p>
      PURCHASER: Wonderful! Most edifying! How much for this lot?
    </p>
    <p>
      HERMES: Two hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      PURCHASER: I will write you a cheque for the money. Come home, Pessimist,
      and begin your lessons without more ado.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERMES: Attention! Here is a magnificent article&mdash;the Positive Life,
      the Scientific Life, the Enthusiastic Life. Who bids for a possible place
      in the Calendar of the Future?
    </p>
    <p>
      PURCHASER: What does he call himself? he has a very French air.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERMES: Put your own questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      PURCHASER: What's your pedigree, my Philosopher, and previous
      performances?
    </p>
    <p>
      POSITIVIST: I am by Rousseau out of Catholicism, with a strain of the
      Evolution blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      PURCHASER: What do you believe in?
    </p>
    <p>
      POSITIVIST: In Man, with a large M.
    </p>
    <p>
      PURCHASER: Not in individual Man?
    </p>
    <p>
      POSITIVIST: By no means; not even always in Mr. Gladstone. All men, all
      Churches, all parties, all philosophies, and even the other sect of our
      own Church, are perpetually in the wrong. Buy me, and listen to me, and
      you will ahvays be in the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      PURCHASER: And, after this life, what have you to offer me?
    </p>
    <p>
      POSITIVIST: A distinguished position in the Choir Invisible: but not, of
      course, conscious immortality.
    </p>
    <p>
      PURCHASER: Take him away, and put up another lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Hegelian, with his Notion, and the Darwinian, with his notions,
      and the Lotzian, with his Broad Church mixture of Religion and Evolution,
      and the Spencerian, with that Absolute which is a sort of a something,
      might all be offered with their divers wares; and cheaply enough, Lucian,
      you would value them in this auction of Sects. 'There is but one way to
      Corinth,' as of old; but which that way may be, oh master of Hermotimus,
      we know no more than he did of old; and still we find, of all
      philosophies, that the Stoic route is most to be recommended. But we have
      our Cyrenaics too, though they are no longer 'clothed in purple, and
      crowned with flowers, and fond of drink and of female flute-players.' Ah,
      here too, you might laugh, and fail to see where the Pleasure lies, when
      the Cyrenaics are no 'judges of cakes' (nor of ale, for that matter), and
      are strangers in the Courts of Princes. 'To despise all things, to make
      use of all things, in all things to follow pleasure only:' that is not the
      manner of the new, if it were the secret of the older Hedonism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning from the philosophers to the seekers after a sign, what
      change, Lucian, would you find in them and their ways? None; they are
      quite unaltered. Still our Perigrinus, and our Perigrina too, come to us
      from the East, or, if from the West, they take India on their way&mdash;India,
      that secular home of drivelling creeds, and of religion in its
      sacerdotage. Still they prattle of Brahmins and Buddhism; though, unlike
      Peregrinus, they do not publicly burn themselves on pyres, at Epsom Downs,
      after the Derby. We are not so fortunate in the demise of our
      Theosophists; and our police, less wise than the Hellenodicae, would
      probably not permit the Immolation of the Quack. Like your Alexander, they
      deal in marvels and miracles, oracles and warnings. All such bogy stories
      as those of your 'Philopseudes,' and the ghost of the lady who took to
      table-rapping because one of her best slippers had not been burned with
      her body, are gravely investigated by the Psychical Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even your ignorant Bibliophile is still with us&mdash;the man without a
      tinge of letters, who buys up old manuscripts 'because they are stained
      and gnawed, and who goes, for proof of valued antiquity, to the testimony
      of the book-worms.' And the rich Bibliophile now, as in your satire,
      clothes his volumes in purple morocco and gay <i>dorures</i>, while their
      contents are sealed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the topics of satire and gay curiosity which occupy the lady known
      as 'Gyp,' and M. Halévy in his 'Les Petites Cardinal,' if you had not
      exhausted the matter in your 'Dialogues of Hetairai,' you would be amused
      to find the same old traits surviving without a touch of change. One
      reads, in Halévy's French, of Madame Cardinal, and, in your Greek, of the
      mother of Philinna, and marvels that eighteen hundred years have not in
      one single trifle altered the mould. Still the old shabby light-loves, the
      old greed, the old luxury and squalor. Still the unconquerable
      superstition that now seeks to tell fortunes by the cards, and, in your
      time, resorted to the sorceress with her magical 'bull-roarer' or '<i>turndun</i>.'
      (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1)The Greek <i>rombos</i> [transliterated], mentioned by Lucian
     and Theocritus, was the magical weapon of the Australians&mdash;
     the <i>turndun</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Yes, Lucian, we are the same vain creatures of doubt and dread, of
      unbelief and credulity, of avarice and pretence, that you knew, and at
      whom you smiled. Nay, our very 'social question' is not altered. Do you
      not write, in 'The Runaways,' 'The artisans will abandon their workshops,
      and leave their trades, when they see that, with all the labour that bows
      their bodies from dawn to dark, they make a petty and starveling pittance,
      while men that toil not nor spin are floating in Pactolus'?
    </p>
    <p>
      They begin to see this again as of yore; but whether the end of their
      vision will be a laughing matter, you, fortunate Lucian, do not need to
      care. Hail to you, and farewell!

      VII. To Maitre Francoys Rabelais.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Of the Coming of the Coqcigrues.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Master,&mdash;In the Boreal and Septentrional lands, turned aside from the
      noonday and the sun, there dwelt of old (as thou knowest, and as Olaus
      voucheth) a race of men, brave, strong, nimble, and adventurous, who had
      no other care but to fight and drink. There, by reason of the cold (as
      Virgil witnesseth), men break wine with axes. To their minds, when once
      they were dead and gotten to Valhalla, or the place of their Gods, there
      would be no other pleasure but to swig, tipple, drink, and boose till the
      coming of that last darkness and Twilight, wherein they, with their
      deities, should do battle against the enemies of all mankind; which day
      they rather desired than dreaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      So chanced it also with Pantagruel and Brother John and their company,
      after they had once partaken of the secret of the <i>Dive Bouteille</i>.
      Thereafter they searched no longer; but, abiding at their ease, were
      merry, frolic, jolly, gay, glad, and wise; only that they always and ever
      did expect the awful Coming of the Coqcigrues. Now concerning the day of
      that coming, and the nature of them that should come, they knew nothing;
      and for his part Panurge was all the more adread, as Aristotle testifieth
      that men (and Panurge above others) most fear that which they know least.
      Now it chanced one day, as they sat at meat, with viands rare, dainty, and
      precious as ever Apicius dreamed of, that there fluttered on the air a
      faint sound as of sermons, speeches, orations, addresses, discourses,
      lectures, and the like; whereat Panurge, pricking up his ears, cried,
      'Methinks this wind bloweth from Midlothian,' and so fell a trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, to their aural orifices, and the avenues audient of the brain, was
      borne a very melancholy sound as of harmoniums, hymns, organ-pianos,
      psalteries, and the like, all playing different airs, in a kind most
      hateful to the Muses. Then said Panurge, as well as he might for the
      chattering of his teeth: 'May I never drink if here come not the
      Coqcigrues!' and this saying and prophecy of his was true and inspired.
      But thereon the others began to mock, flout, and gird at Panurge for his
      cowardice. 'Here am I!' cried Brother John, 'well-armed and ready to stand
      a siege; being entrenched, fortified, hemmed-in and surrounded with great
      pasties, huge pieces of salted beef, salads, fricassees, hams, tongues,
      pies, and a wilderness of pleasant little tarts, jellies, pastries,
      trifles, and fruits of all kinds, and I shall not thirst while I have good
      wells, founts, springs, and sources of Bordeaux wine, Burgundy, wine of
      the Champagne country, sack and Canary. A fig for thy Coqcigrues!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But even as he spoke there ran up suddenly a whole legion, or rather army,
      of physicians, each armed with laryngoscopes, stethoscopes, horoscopes,
      microscopes, weighing machines, and such other tools, engines, and arms as
      they had who, after thy time, persecuted Monsieur de Pourceaugnac! And
      they all, rushing on Brother John, cried out to him, 'Abstain! Abstain!'
      And one said, 'I have well diagnosed thee, and thou art in a fair way to
      have the gout.' 'I never did better in my days,' said Brother John. 'Away
      with thy meats and drinks!' they cried. And one said, 'He must to Royat;'
      and another, 'Hence with him to Aix;' and a third, 'Banish him to
      Wiesbaden;' and a fourth, 'Hale him to Gastein;' and yet another, 'To
      Barbouille with him in chains!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And while others felt his pulse and looked at his tongue, they all wrote
      prescriptions for him like men mad. 'For thy eating,' cried he that seemed
      to be their leader, 'No soup!' 'No soup!' quoth Brother John; and those
      cheeks of his, whereat you might have warmed your two hands in the winter
      solstice, grew white as lilies. 'Nay! and no salmon nor any beef nor
      mutton! A little chicken by times, but <i>periculo tuo</i>! Nor any game,
      such as grouse, partridge, pheasant, capercailzie, wild duck; nor any
      cheese, nor fruit, nor pastry, nor coffee, nor eau de vie; and avoid all
      sweets. No veal, pork, nor made dishes of any kind.' 'Then what may I
      eat?' quoth the good Brother, whose valour had oozed out of the soles of
      his sandals. 'A little cold bacon at breakfast&mdash;no eggs,' quoth the
      leader of the strange folk, 'and a slice of toast without butter.' 'And
      for thy drink'&mdash;('What?' gasped Brother John)&mdash;'one
      dessert-spoonful of whisky, with a pint of the water of Apollinaris at
      luncheon and dinner. No more!' At this Brother John fainted, falling like
      a great buttress of a hill, such as Taygetus or Erymanthus.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were busy with him, others of the frantic folk had built great
      platforms of wood, whereon they all stood and spoke at once, both men and
      women. And of these some wore red crosses on their garments, which meaneth
      'Salvation;' and others wore white crosses, with a little black button of
      crape, to signify 'Purity;' and others bits of blue to mean 'Abstinence.'
      While some of these pursued Panurge others did beset Pantagruel; asking
      him very long questions, whereunto he gave but short answers. Thus they
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      Have ye Local Option here?&mdash;Pan.: What?
    </p>
    <p>
      May one man drink if his neighbour be not athirst?&mdash;Pan.: Yea!
    </p>
    <p>
      Have ye Free Education?&mdash;Pan.: What?
    </p>
    <p>
      Must they that have, pay to school them that have not?&mdash;Pan.: Nay
    </p>
    <p>
      Have ye free land?&mdash;Pan.: What?
    </p>
    <p>
      Have ye taken the land from the farmer, and given it to the tailor out of
      work and the candlemaker masterless?&mdash;Pan.: Nay!
    </p>
    <p>
      Have your women folk votes?&mdash;Pan.: Bosh!
    </p>
    <p>
      Have ye got religion?&mdash;Pan.: How?
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you go about the streets at night, brawling, blowing a trumpet before
      you, and making long prayers?&mdash;Pan.: Nay
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you manhood suffrage?&mdash;Pan.: Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is Jack as good as his master? Pan.: Nay!
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you joined the Arbitration Society?&mdash;Pan.: <i>Quoy?</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Will you let another kick you, and will you ask his neighbour if you
      deserve the same?&mdash;Pan.: Nay?
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you cat what you list?&mdash;Pan.: Ay!
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you drink when you are athirst? Pan.: Ay!
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you governed by the free expression of the popular will?&mdash;Pan.:
      How?
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you servants of priests, pulpits, and penny papers?&mdash;Pan.: No!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when they heard these answers of Pantagruel they all fell, some a
      weeping, some a praying, some a swearing, some an arbitrating, some a
      lecturing, some a caucussing, some a preaching, some a faith-healing, some
      a miracle-working, some a hypnotising, some a writing to the daily press;
      and while they were thus busy, like folk distraught, 'reforming the
      island,' Pantagruel burst out a laughing; whereat they were greatly
      dismayed; for laughter killeth the whole race of Coqcigrues, and they may
      not endure it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Pantagruel and his company stole aboard a barque that Panurge had
      ready in the harbour. And having provisioned her well with store of meat
      and good drink, they set sail for the kingdom of Entelechy, where, having
      landed, they were kindly entreated; and there abide to this day; drinking
      of the sweet and eating of the fat, under the protection of that
      intellectual sphere which hath in all places its centre and nowhere its
      circumference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was their destiny; there was their end appointed, and thither the
      Coqcigrues can never come. For all the air of that land is full of
      laughter, which killeth Coqcigrues; and there aboundeth the herb
      Pantagruelion. But for thee, Master Francoys, thou art not well liked in
      this island of ours, where the Coqcigrues are abundant, very fierce,
      cruel, and tyrannical. Yet thou hast thy friends, that meet and drink to
      thee and wish thee well wheresoever thou hast found thy <i>grand peut-étre</i>.

    <h2>
      VIII. To Jane Austen.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Madame,&mdash;If to the enjoyments of your present state be lacking a view
      of the minor infirmities or foibles of men, I cannot but think (were the
      thought permitted) that your pleasures are yet incomplete. Moreover, it is
      certain that a woman of parts who has once meddled with literature will
      never wholly lose her love for the discussion of that delicious topic, nor
      cease to relish what (in the cant of our new age) is styled 'literary
      shop.' For these reasons I attempt to convey to you some inkling of the
      present state of that agreeable art which you, madam, raised to its
      highest pitch of perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to your own works (immortal, as I believe), I have but little that is
      wholly cheering to tell one who, among women of letters, was almost alone
      in her freedom from a lettered vanity. You are not a very popular author:
      your volumes are not found in gaudy covers on every bookstall; or, if
      found, are not perused with avidity by the Emmas and Catherines of our
      generation. 'Tis not long since a blow was dealt (in the estimation of the
      unreasoning) at your character as an author by the publication of your
      familiar letters. The editor of these epistles, unfortunately, did not
      always take your witticisms, and he added others which were too
      unmistakably his own. While the injudicious were disappointed by the
      absence of your exquisite style and humour, the wiser sort were the more
      convinced of your wisdom. In your letters (knowing your correspondents)
      you gave but the small personal talk of the hour, for them sufficient; for
      your books you reserved matter and expression which are imperishable. Your
      admirers, if not very numerous, include all persons of taste, who, in your
      favour, are apt somewhat to abate the rule, or shake off the habit, which
      commonly confines them to but temperate laudation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'T is the fault of all art to seem antiquated and faded in the eyes of the
      succeeding generation. The manners of your age were not the manners of
      to-day, and young gentlemen and ladies who think Scott 'slow,' think Miss
      Austen 'prim' and 'dreary.' Yet, even could you return among us, I
      scarcely believe that, speaking the language of the hour, as you might,
      and versed in its habits, you would win the general admiration. For how
      tame, madam, are your characters, especially your favourite heroines! how
      limited the life which you knew and described! how narrow the range of
      your incidents! how correct your grammar!
    </p>
    <p>
      As heroines, for example, you chose ladies like Emma, and Elizabeth, and
      Catherine: women remarkable neither for the brilliance nor for the
      degradation of their birth; women wrapped up in their own and the parish's
      concerns, ignorant of evil, as it seems, and unacquainted with vain
      yearnings and interesting doubts. Who can engage his fancy with their
      match-makings and the conduct of their affections, when so many daring and
      dazzling heroines approach and solicit his regard?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are princesses dressed in white velvet stamped with golden
      fleurs-de-lys&mdash;ladies with hearts of ice and lips of fire, who count
      their roubles by the million, their lovers by the score, and even their
      husbands, very often, in figures of some arithmetical importance. With
      these are the immaculate daughters of itinerant Italian musicians, maids
      whose souls are unsoiled amidst the contaminations of our streets, and
      whose acquaintance with the art of Phidias and Praxiteles, of Daedalus and
      Scopas, is the more admirable, because entirely derived from loving study
      of the inexpensive collections vended by the plaster-of-Paris man round
      the corner. When such heroines are wooed by the nephews of Dukes, where
      are your Emmas and Elizabeths? Your volumes neither excite nor satisfy the
      curiosities provoked by that modern and scientific fiction, which is
      greatly admired, I learn, in the United States, as well as in France and
      at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      You erred, it cannot be denied, with your eyes open. Knowing Lydia and
      Kitty so intimately as you did, why did you make of them almost
      insignificant characters? With Lydia for a heroine you might have gone
      far; and, had you devoted three volumes, and the chief of your time, to
      the passions of Kitty, you might have held your own, even now, in the
      circulating library. How Lyddy, perched on a corner of the roof, first
      beheld her Wickham; how, on her challenge, he climbed up by a ladder to
      her side; how they kissed, caressed, swung on gates together, met at odd
      seasons, in strange places, and finally eloped: all this might have been
      put in the mouth of a jealous elder sister, say Elizabeth, and you would
      not have been less popular than several favourites of our time. Had you
      cast the whole narrative into the present tense, and lingered lovingly
      over the thickness of Mary's legs and the softness of Kitty's cheeks, and
      the blonde fluffiness of Wickham's whiskers, you would have left a romance
      still dear to young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or again, you might entrance your students still, had you concentrated
      your attention on Mrs. Rushworth, who eloped with Henrv Crawford. These
      should have been the chief figures of 'Mansfield Park.' But you timidly
      decline to tackle Passion. 'Let other pens,' you write, 'dwell on guilt
      and misery. I quit such odious subjects as soon as I can.' Ah, <i>there</i>
      is the secret of your failure! Need I add that the vulgarity and
      narrowness of the social circles you describe impair your popularity? I
      scarce remember more than one lady of title, and but very few lords (and
      these unessential) in all your tales. Now, when we all wish to be in
      society, we demand plenty of titles in our novels, at any rate, and we get
      lords (and very queer lords) even from Republican authors, born in a
      country which in your time was not renowned for its literature. I have
      heard a critic remark, with a decided air of fashion, on the brevity of
      the notice which your characters give each other when they offer
      invitations to dinner. 'An invitation to dinner next day was despatched,'
      and this demonstrates that your acquaintance 'went out' very little, and
      had but few engagements. How vulgar, too, is one of your heroines, who
      bids Mr. Darcy 'keep his breath to cool his porridge.' I blush for
      Elizabeth! It were superfluous to add that your characters are debased by
      being invariably mere members of the Church of England as by law
      established. The Dissenting enthusiast, the open soul that glides from
      Esoteric Buddhism to the Salvation Army, and from the Higher Pantheism to
      the Higher Paganism, we look for in vain among your studies of character.
      Nay, the very words I employ are of unknown sound to you; so how can you
      help us in the stress of the soul's travailings?
    </p>
    <p>
      You may say that the soul's travailings are no affair of yours; proving
      thereby that you have indeed but a lowly conception of the duty of the
      novelist. I only remember one reference, in all your works, to that
      controversy which occupies the chief of our attention&mdash;the great
      controversy on Creation or Evolution. Your Jane Bennet cries: 'I have no
      idea of there being so much Design in the world as some persons imagine.'
      Nor do you touch on our mighty social question, the Land Laws, save when
      Mrs. Bennet appears as a Land Reformer, and rails bitterly against the
      cruelty 'of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in
      favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.' There, madam, in that
      cruelly unjust performance, what a text you had for a <i>Tendenz-Roman</i>.
      Nay, you can allow Kitty to report that a Private had been flogged,
      without introducing a chapter on Flogging in the Army. But you formally
      declined to stretch your matter out, here and there, 'with solemn specious
      nonsense about something unconnected with the story.' No 'padding' for
      Miss Austen! In fact, madam, as you were born before Analysis came in, or
      Passion, or Realism, or Naturalism, or Irreverence, or Religious
      Open-mindedness, you really cannot hope to rival your literary sisters in
      the minds of a perplexed generation. Your heroines are not passionate, we
      do not see their red wet cheeks, and tresses dishevelled in the manner of
      our frank young Maenads. What says your best successor, a lady who adds
      fresh lustre to a name that in fiction equals yours? She says of Miss
      Austen: 'Her heroines have a stamp of their own. They have a <i>certain
      gentle self-respect and humour and hardness of heart</i>... Love with them
      does not mean a passion as much as an interest, deep and silent.' I think
      one prefers them so, and that Englishwomen should be more like Anne Elliot
      than Maggie Tulliver. 'All the privilege I claim for my own sex is that of
      loving longest when existence or when hope is gone,' said Anne; perhaps
      she insisted on a monopoly that neither sex has all to itself. Ah, madam,
      what a relief it is to come back to your witty volumes, and forget the
      follies of to-day in those of Mr. Collins and of Mrs. Bennet! How fine,
      nay, how noble is your art in its delicate reserve, never insisting, never
      forcing the note, never pushing the sketch into the caricature! You worked
      without thinking of it, in the spirit of Greece, on a labour happily
      limited, and exquisitely organised. 'Dear books,' we say, with Miss
      Thackeray&mdash;'dear books, bright, sparkling with wit and animation, in
      which the homely heroines charm, the dull hours fly, and the very bores
      are enchanting.'

    <h2>
      IX. To Master Isaak Walton.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Father Isaak,&mdash;When I would be quiet and go angling it is my custom
      to carry in my wallet thy pretty book, 'The Compleat Angler.' Here,
      methinks, if I find not trout I shall find content, and good company, and
      sweet songs, fair milkmaids, and country mirth. For you are to know that
      trout be now scarce, and whereas he was ever a fearful fish, he hath of
      late become so wary that none but the cunningest anglers may be even with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not as it was in your time, Father, when a man might leave his shop
      in Fleet Street, of a holiday, and, when he had stretched his legs up
      Tottenham Hill, come lightly to meadows chequered with waterlilies and
      lady-smocks, and so fall to his sport. Nay, now have the houses so much
      increased, like a spreading sore (through the breaking of that excellent
      law of the Conscientious King and blessed Martyr, whereby building beyond
      the walls was forbidden), that the meadows are all swallowed up in
      streets. And as to the River Lea, wherein you took many a good trout, I
      read in the news sheets that 'its bed is many inches thick in horrible
      filth, and the air for more than half a mile on each side of it is
      polluted with a horrible, sickening stench,' so that we stand in dread of
      a new Plague, called the Cholera. And so it is all about London for many
      miles, and if a man, at heavy charges, betake himself to the fields, lo
      you, folk are grown so greedy that none will suffer a stranger to fish in
      his water.
    </p>
    <p>
      So poor anglers are in sore straits. Unless a man be rich and can pay
      great rents, he may not fish, in England, and hence spring the discontents
      of the times, for the angler is full of content, if he do but take trout,
      but if he be driven from the waterside, he falls, perchance, into evil
      company, and cries out to divide the property of the gentle folk. As many
      now do, even among Parliament, men, whom you loved not, Father Isaak,
      neither do I love them more than Reason and Scripture bid each of us be
      kindly to his neighbour. But, behold, the causes of the ill content are
      not yet all expressed, for even where a man hath licence to fish, he will
      hardly take trout in our age, unless he be all the more cunning. For the
      fish, harried this way and that by so many of your disciples, is exceeding
      shy and artful, nor will he bite at a fly unless it falleth lightly, just
      above his mouth, and floateth dry over him, for all the world like the
      natural <i>ephemeris</i>. And we may no longer angle with worm for him,
      nor with penk or minnow, nor with the natural fly, as was your manner, but
      only with the artificial, for the more difficulty the more diversion. For
      my part I may cry, like Viator in your book, 'Master, I can neither catch
      with the first nor second Angle: I have no fortune.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So we fare in England, but somewhat better north of the Tweed, where trout
      are less wary, but for the most part small, except in the extreme rough
      north, among horrid hills and lakes. Thither, Master, as methinks you may
      remember, went Richard Franck, that called himself <i>Philanthropus</i>,
      and was, as it were, the Columbus of anglers, discovering for them a new
      Hyperborean world. But Franck, doubtless, is now an angler in the Lake of
      Darkness, with Nero and other tyrants, for he followed after Cromwell, the
      man of blood, in the old riding days. How wickedly doth Franck boast of
      that leader of the giddy multitude, 'when they raged, and became restless
      to find out misery for themselves and others, and the rabble would herd
      themselves together,' as you said, 'and endeavour to govern and act in
      spite of authority.' So you wrote; and what said Franck, that recreant
      angler? Doth he not praise 'Ireton, Vane, Nevill, and Martin, and the most
      renowned, valorous, and victorious conqueror, Oliver Cromwell.' Natheless,
      with all his sins on his head, this Franck discovered Scotland for
      anglers, and my heart turns to him when he praises 'the glittering and
      resolute streams of Tweed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In those wilds of Assynt and Loch Rannoch, Father, we, thy followers, may
      yet take trout, and forget the evils of the times. But, to be done with
      Franck, how harshly he speaks of thee and thy book. 'For you may dedicate
      your opinion to what scribbling putationer you please; the <i>Compleat
      Angler</i> if you will, who tells you of a tedious fly story,
      extravagantly collected from antiquated authors, such as Gesner and
      Dubravius.' Again, he speaks of 'Isaac Walton, whose authority to me seems
      alike authentick, as is the general opinion of the vulgar prophet,' &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain I am that Franck, if a better angler than thou, was a worse man,
      who, writing his 'Dialogues Piscatorial' or 'Northern Memoirs' five years
      after the world welcomed thy 'Compleat Angler,' was jealous of thy favour
      with the people, and, may be, hated thee for thy loyalty and sound faith.
      But, Master, like a peaceful man avoiding contention, thou didst never
      answer this blustering Franck, but wentest quietly about thy quiet Lea,
      and left him his roaring Brora and windy Assynt. How could this noisy man
      know thee&mdash;and know thee he did, having argued with thee in Stafford&mdash;and
      not love Isaak Walton? A pedant angler, I call him, a plaguy angler, so
      let him huff away, and turn we to thee and to thy sweet charm in fishing
      for men.
    </p>
    <p>
      How often, studying in thy book, have I hummed to myself that of Horace&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Laudis amore tumes? Sunt certa piacula quae te
   Ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello.
</pre>
    <p>
      So healing a book for the frenzy of fame is thy discourse on meadows, and
      pure streams, and the country life. How peaceful, men say, and blessed
      must have been the life of this old man, how lapped in content, and hedged
      about by his own humility from the world! They forget, who speak thus,
      that thy years, which were many, were also evil, or would have seemed evil
      to divers that had tasted of thy fortunes. Thou wert poor, but that, to
      thee, was no sorrow, for greed of money was thy detestation. Thou wert of
      lowly rank, in an age when gentle blood was alone held in regard; yet tiny
      virtues made thee hosts of friends, and chiefly among religious men,
      bishops, and doctors of the Church. Thy private life was not unacquainted
      with sorrow; thy first wife and all her fair children were taken from thee
      like flowers in spring, though, in thine age, new love and new offspring
      comforted thee like 'the primrose of the later year.' Thy private griefs
      might have made thee bitter, or melancholy, so might the sorrows of the
      State and of the Church, which were deprived of their heads by cruel men,
      despoiled of their wealth, the pious driven, like thee, from their homes;
      fear everywhere, everywhere robbery and confusion: all this ruin might
      have angered another temper. But thou, Father, didst bear all with so much
      sweetness as perhaps neither natural temperament, nor a firm faith, nor
      the love of angling could alone have displayed. For we see many anglers
      (as witness Richard Franck aforesaid) who are angry men, and myself, when
      I get my hooks entangled at every cast in a tree, have come nigh to swear
      prophane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also we see religious men that are sour and fanatical, no rare thing in
      the party that professes godliness. But neither private sorrow nor public
      grief could abate thy natural kindliness, nor shake a religion which was
      not untried, but had, indeed, passed through the furnace like fine gold.
      For if we find not Faith at all times easy, because of the oppositions of
      Science, and the searching curiosity of men's minds, neither was Faith a
      matter of course in thy day. For the learned and pious were greatly tossed
      about, like worthy Mr. Chillingworth, by doubts wavering between the
      Church of Rome and the Reformed Church of England. The humbler folk, also,
      were invited, now here, now there, by the clamours of fanatical
      Nonconformists, who gave themselves out to be somebody, while Atheism
      itself was not without many to witness to it. Therefore, such a religion
      as thine was not, so to say, a mere innocence of evil in the things of our
      Belief, but a reasonable and grounded faith, strong in despite of
      oppositions. Happy was the man in whom temper, and religion, and the love
      of the sweet country and an angler's pastime so conveniently combined;
      happy the long life which held in its hand that threefold clue through the
      labyrinth of human fortunes! Around thee Church and State might fall in
      ruins, and might be rebuilded, and thy tears would not be bitter, nor thy
      triumph cruel.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Thus, by God's blessing, it befell thee
         Nec turpem senectam
   Degere, nec cithara carentem.
</pre>
    <p>
      I would, Father, that I could get at the verity about thy poems. Those
      recommendatory verses with which thou didst grace the Lives of Dr. Donne
      and others of thy friends, redound more to the praise of thy kind heart
      than thy fancy. But what or whose was the pastoral poem of 'Thealma and
      Clearchus,' which thou didst set about printing in 1678, and gavest to the
      world in 1683? Thou gavest John Chalkhill for the author's name, and a
      John Chalkhill of thy kindred died at Winchester, being eighty years of
      his age, in 1679. Now thou speakest of John Chalkhill as 'a friend of
      Edmund Spenser's,' and how could this be?
    </p>
    <p>
      Are they right who hold that John Chalkhill was but a name of a friend,
      borrowed by thee out of modesty, and used as a cloak to cover poetry of
      thine own inditing? When Mr. Flatman writes of Chalkhill, 't is in words
      well fitted to thine own merit:

   Happy old man, whose worth all mankind knows
   Except himself, who charitably shows
   The ready road to virtue and to praise,
   The road to many long and happy days.
</pre>
    <p>
      However it be, in that road, by quiet streams and through green pastures,
      thou didst walk all thine almost century of years, and we, who stray into
      thy path out of the highway of life, we seem to hold thy hand, and listen
      to thy cheerful voice. If our sport be worse, may our content be equal,
      and our praise, therefore, none the less. Father, if Master Stoddard, the
      great fisher of Tweed-side, be with thee, greet him for me, and thank him
      for those songs of his, and perchance he will troll thee a catch of our
      dear River.

      X. To M. Chapelain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur,&mdash;You were a popular writer, and an honourable,
      over-educated, upright gentleman. Of the latter character you can never be
      deprived, and I doubt not it stands you in better stead where you are,
      than the laurels which flourished so gaily, and faded so soon.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Laurel is green for a season, and Love is fair for a day,
  But Love grows bitter with treason, and laurel out-lives not May.
</pre>
    <p>
      I know not if Mr. Swinburne is correct in his botany, but <i>your</i>
      laurel certainly outlived not May, nor can we hope that you dwell where
      Orpheus and where Homer are. Some other crown, some other Paradise, we
      cannot doubt it, awaited <i>un si bon homme</i>. But the moral excellence
      that even Boileau admitted, <i>ladfoi, l'honneur, la probiité,</i> do not
      in Parnassus avail the popular poet, and some luckless Musset or
      Théophile, Regnier or Villars attains a kind of immortality denied to the
      man of many contemporary editions, and of a great commercial success.
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever, for the confusion of Horace, any Poet was Made, you, Sir, should
      have been that fortunately manufactured article. You were, in matters of
      the Muses, the child of many prayers. Never, since Adam's day, have any
      parents but yours prayed for a poet-child. Then Destiny, that mocks the
      desires of men in general, and fathers in particular, heard the appeal,
      and presented M. Chapelain and Jeanne Corbiére his wife with the future
      author of 'La Pucelle.' Oh futile hopes of men, <i>O pectora caeca!</i>
      All was done that education could do for a genius which, among other
      qualities, 'especially lacked fire and imagination,' and an ear for verse&mdash;sad
      defects these in a child of the Muses. Your training in all the mechanics
      and metaphysics of criticism might have made you exclaim, like Rasselas,
      'Enough! Thou hast convinced me that no human being can ever be a Poet.'
      Unhappily, you succeeded in convincing Cardinal Richelieu that to be a
      Poet was well within your powers, you received a pension of one thousand
      crowns, and were made Captain of the Cardinal's minstrels, as M. de
      Tréville was Captain of the King's Musketeers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, pleasant age to live in, when good intentions in poetry were more
      richly endowed than ever is Research, even Research in Prehistoric
      English, among us niggard moderns! How I wish I knew a Cardinal, or, even
      as you did, a Prime Minister, who would praise and pension me; but Envy be
      still! Your existence was more happy indeed; you constructed odes,
      corrected sonnets, presided at the Ho'tel Rambouillet, while the learned
      ladies were still young and fair, and you enjoyed a prodigious celebrity
      on the score of your yet unpublished Epic. 'Who, indeed,' says a
      sympathetic author, M. Théophile Gautier, 'who could expect less than a
      miracle from a man so deeply learned in the laws of art&mdash;a perfect
      Turk in the science of poetry, a person so well pensioned, and so favoured
      by the great?' Bishops and politicians combined in perfect good faith to
      advertise your merits. Hard must have been the heart that could resist the
      testimonials of your skill as a poet offered by the Duc de Montausier, and
      the learned Huet, Bishop of Avranches, and Monseigneur Godeau, Bishop of
      Vence, or M. Colbert, who had such a genius for finance.
    </p>
    <p>
      If bishops and politicians and prime ministers skilled in finance, and
      some critics, Ménage and Sarrazin and Vaugetas, if ladies of birth and
      taste, if all the world in fact, combined to tell you that you were a
      great poet, how can we blame you for taking yourself seriously, and
      appraising yourself at the public estimate?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not in human nature to resist the evidence of the bishops
      especially, and when every minor poet believes in himself on the testimony
      of his own conceit, you may be acquitted of vanity if you listened to the
      plaudits of your friends. Nay, you ventured to pronounce judgment on
      contemporaries whom Posterity has preferred to your perfections.
      'Moliére,' said you, 'understands the nature of comedy, and presents it in
      a natural style. The plot of his best pieces is borrowed, but not without
      judgment; his <i>morale</i> is fair, and he has only to avoid scurrility.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Excellent, unconscious, popular Chapelain!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of yourself you observed, in a Report on contemporary literature, that
      your 'courage and sincerity never allowed you to tolerate work not
      absolutely good.' And yet you regarded 'La Pucellé with some complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 'Pucellé you were occupied during a generation of mortal men. I
      marvel not at the length of your labours, as you received a yearly pension
      till the Epic was finished, but your Muse was no Alcmena, and no Hercules
      was the result of that prolonged night of creations. First you gravely
      wrote out (it was the task of five years) all the compositions in prose.
      Ah, why did you not leave it in that commonplace but appropriate medium?
      What says the Précieuse about you in Boileau's satire?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  In Chapelain, for all his foes have said,
  She finds but one defect, he can't be read;
  Yet thinks the world might taste his maiden's woes,
  If only he would turn his verse to prose!
</pre>
    <p>
      The verse had been prose, and prose, perhaps, it should have remained. Yet
      for this precious 'Pucelle,' in the age when 'Paradise Lost' was sold for
      five pounds, you are believed to have received about four thousand. Horace
      was wrong, mediocre poets may exist (now and then), and he was a wise man
      who first spoke of <i>aurea mediocritas</i>. At length the great work was
      achieved, a work thrice blessed in its theme, that divine Maiden to whom
      France owes all, and whom you and Voltaire have recompensed so strangely.
      In folio, in italics, with a score of portraits and engravings, and <i>culs
      de lampe</i>, the great work was given to the world, and had a success.
      Six editions in eighteen months are figures which fill the poetic heart
      with envy and admiration. And then, alas! the bubble burst. A great lady,
      Madame de Longveille, hearing the 'Pucellé read aloud, murmured that it
      was 'perfect indeed, but perfectly wearisome.' Then the satires began, and
      the satirists never left you till your poetic reputation was a rag, till
      the mildest Abbé at Ménagés had his cheap sneer for Chapelain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I make no doubt, Sir, that envy and jealousy had much to do with the
      onslaught on your 'Pucelle.' These qualities, alas! are not strange to
      literary minds; does not even Hesiod tell us 'potter hates potter, and
      poet hates poet'? But contemporary spites do not harm true genius. Who
      suffered more than Moliére from cabals? Yet neither the court nor the town
      ever deserted him, and he is still the joy of the world. I admit that his
      adversaries were weaker than yours. What were Boursault and Le Boulanger,
      and Thomas Corneille and De Visé, what were they all compared to your
      enemy, Boileau? Brossette tells a story which really makes a man pity you.
      There was a M. de Puimorin who, to be in the fashion, laughed at your once
      popular Epic. 'It is all very well for a man to laugh who cannot even
      read.' Whereon M. de Puimorin replied: 'Qu'il n'avoit que trop su' lire,
      depuis que Chapelain s'étoit avisé de faire imprimer.' A new horror had
      been added to the accomplishment of reading since Chapelain had published.
      This repartee was applauded, and M. de Puimorin tried to turn it into an
      epigram. He did complete the last couplet,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Hélas! pour mes péchés, je n'ai su' que trop lire
 Depuis que tu fais imprimer.
</pre>
    <p>
      But by no labour would M. de Puimorin achieve the first two lines of his
      epigram. Then you remember what great allies came to his assistance. I
      almost blush to think that M. Despréaux, M. Racine, and M. de Moliére, the
      three most renowned wits of the time, conspired to complete the poor jest,
      and madden you. Well, bubble as your poetry was, you may be proud that it
      needed all these sharpest of pens to prick the bubble. Other poets, as
      popular as you, have been annihilated by an article. Macaulay puts forth
      his hand, and 'Satan Montgomery' was no more. It did not need a Macaulay,
      the laughter of a mob of little critics was enough to blow into space; but
      you probably have met Montgomery, and of contemporary failures or
      successes I do not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder, sometimes, whether the consensus of criticism ever made you
      doubt for a moment whether, after all, you were not a false child of
      Apollo? Was your complacency tortured, as the complacency of true poets
      has occasionally been, by doubts? Did you expect posterity to reverse the
      verdict of the satirists, and to do you justice? You answered your
      earliest assailant, Liniére, and, by a few changes of words, turned his
      epigrams into flattery. But I fancy, on the whole, you remained calm,
      unmoved, wrapped up in admiration of yourself. According to M. de
      Marivaux, who reviewed, as I am doing, the spirits of the mighty dead, you
      'conceived, on the strength of your reputation, a great and serious
      veneration for yourself and your genius.' Probably you were protected by
      this invulnerable armour of an honest vanity, probably you declared that
      mere jealousy dictates the lines of Boileau, and that Chapelain's real
      fault was his popularity, and his pecuniary success, Qu'il soit le mieux
      renté de tous les beaux-esprits.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, you would avow, was your offence, and perhaps you were not
      altogether mistaken. Yet posterity declines to read a line of yours, and,
      as we think of you, we are again set face to face with that eternal
      problem, how far is popularity a test of poetry? Burns was a poet, and
      popular. Byron was a popular poet, and the world agrees in the verdict of
      their own generation. But Montgomery, though he sold so well, was no poet,
      nor, Sir, I fear, was your verse made of the stuff of immortality.
      Criticism cannot hurt what is truly great; the Cardinal and the Academy
      left Chiméne as fair as ever, and as adorable. It is only pinchbeck that
      perishes under the acids of satire: gold defies them. Yet I sometimes ask
      myself, does the existence of popularity like yours justify the malignity
      of satire, which blesses neither him who gives, nor him who takes? Are
      poisoned arrows fair against a bad poet? I doubt it, Sir, holding that,
      even unpricked, a poetic bubble must soon burst by its own nature. Yet
      satire will assuredly be written so long as bad poets are successful, and
      bad poets will assuredly reflect that their assailants are merely envious,
      and, while their vogue lasts, that Prime Ministers and the purchasing
      public are the only judges.

      XI. To Sir John Manndeville, Kt.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (Of the Ways Into Ynde.)
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sir John,&mdash;wit you well that men holden you but light, and some
      clepen you a Liar. And they say that you never were born in Englond, in
      the town of Seynt Albones, nor have seen and gone through manye diverse
      Londes. And there goeth an old knight at arms, and one that connes Latyn,
      and hath been beyond the sea, and hath seen Prester John's country. And he
      hath been in an Yle that men clepen Burmah, and there bin women bearded.
      Now men call him Colonel Henry Yule, and he hath writ of thee in his great
      booke, Sir John, and he holds thee but lightly. For he saith that ye did
      pill your tales out of Odoric his book, and that ye never saw snails with
      shells as big as houses, nor never met no Devyls, but part of that ye say,
      ye took it out of William of Boldensele his book, yet ye took not his
      wisdom, withal, but put in thine own foolishness. Nevertheless, Sir John,
      for the frailty of Mankynde, ye are held a good fellow, and a merry; so
      now, come, I shall tell you of the new ways into Ynde.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that Lond they have a Queen that governeth all the Lond, and all they
      ben obeyssant to her. And she is the Queen of Englond; for Englishmen have
      taken all the Lond of Ynde. For they were right good werryoures of old,
      and wyse, noble, and worthy. But of late hath risen a new sort of
      Englishman very puny and fearful, and these men clepen Radicals. And they
      go ever in fear, and they scream on high for dread in the streets and the
      houses, and they fain would flee away from all that their fathers gat them
      with the sword. And this sort men call Scuttleres, but the mean folk and
      certain of the womenkind hear them gladly, and they say ever that
      Englishmen should flee out of Ynde. Fro England men gon to Ynde by many
      dyverse Contreyes. For Englishmen ben very stirring and nymble. For they
      ben in the seventh climate, that is of the Moon. And the Moon (ye have
      said it yourself, Sir John, natheless, is it true) is of lightly moving,
      for to go diverse ways, and see strange things, and other diversities of
      the Worlde. Wherefore Englishmen be lightly moving, and far wandering. And
      they gon to Ynde by the great Sea Ocean. First come they to Gibraltar,
      that was the point of Spain, and builded upon a rock; and there ben apes,
      and it is so strong that no man may take it. Natheless did Englishmen take
      it fro the Spanyard, and all to hold the way to Ynde. For ye may sail all
      about Africa, and past the Cape men clepen of Good Hope, but that way unto
      Ynde is long and the sea is weary. Wherefore men rather go by the Midland
      sea, and Englishmen have taken many Yles in that sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      For first they have taken an Yle that is clept Malta; and therein built
      they great castles, to hold it against them of Fraunce, and Italy, and of
      Spain. And from this Ile of Malta Men gon to Cipre. And Cipre is right a
      good Yle, and a fair, and a great, and it hath 4 principal Cytees within
      him. And at Famagost is one of the principal Havens of the sea that is in
      the world, and Englishmen have but a lytel while gone won that Yle from
      the Sarazynes. Yet say that sort of Englishmen where of I told you, that
      is puny and sore adread, that the Lond is poisonous and barren and of no
      avail, for that Lond is much more hotter than it is here. Yet the
      Englishmen that ben werryoures dwell there in tents, and the skill is that
      they may ben the more fresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Cypre, Men gon to the Lond of Egypte, and in a Day and a Night he
      that hath a good wind may come to the Haven of Alessandrie. Now the Lond
      of Egypt longeth to the Soudan, yet the Soudan longeth not to the Lond of
      Egypt. And when I say this, I do jape with words, and may hap ye
      understond me not. Now Englishmen went in shippes to Alessandrie, and
      brent it, and over ran the Lond, and their soudyours warred agen the
      Bedoynes, and all to hold the way to Ynde. For it is not long past since
      Frenchmen let dig a dyke, through the narrow spit of lond, from the
      Midland sea to the Red sea, wherein was Pharaoh drowned. So this is the
      shortest way to Ynde there may be, to sail through that dyke, if men gon
      by sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the Lond of Egypt is clepen the Vale enchaunted; for no man may do
      his business well that goes thither, but always fares he evil, and
      therefore clepen they Egypt the Vale perilous, and the sepulchre of
      reputations. And men say there that is one of the entrees of Helle. In
      that Vale is plentiful lack of Gold and Silver, for many misbelieving men,
      and many Christian men also, have gone often time for to take of the
      Thresoure that there was of old, and have pilled the Thresoure, wherefore
      there is none left. And Englishmen have let carry thither great store of
      our Thresoure, 9,000,000 of Pounds sterling, and whether they will see it
      agen I misdoubt me. For that Vale is alle fulle of Develes and Fiendes
      that men clepen Bondholderes, for that Egypt from of olde is the Lond of
      Bondage. And whatsoever Thresoure cometh into the Lond, these Devyls of
      Bondholders grabben the same. Natheless by that Vale do Englishmen go unto
      Ynde, and they gon by Aden, even to Kurrachee, at the mouth of the Flood
      of Ynde. Thereby they send their souldyours, when they are adread of them
      of Muscovy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, look you, there is another way into Ynde, and thereby the men of
      Muscovy are fain to come, if the Englishmen let them not. That way cometh
      by Desert and Wildernesse, from the sea that is clept Caspian, even to
      Khiva, and so to Merv; and then come ye to Zulfikar and Penjdeh, and anon
      to Herat, that is called the Key of the Gates of Ynde. Then ye win the
      lond of the Emir of the Afghauns, a great prince and a rich, and he hath
      in his Thresoure more crosses, and stars, and coats that captains wearen,
      than any other man on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all they of Muscovy, and all Englishmen maken him gifts, and he
      keepeth the gifts, and he keepeth his own counsel. For his lond lieth
      between Ynde and the folk of Muscovy, wherefore both Englishmen and men of
      Muscovy would fain have him friendly, yea, and independent. Wherefore they
      of both parties give him clocks, and watches, and stars, and crosses, and
      culverins, and now and again they let cut the throats of his men some
      deal, and pill his country. Thereby they both set up their rest that the
      Emir will be independent, yea, and friendly. But his men love him not,
      neither love they the English nor the Muscovy folk, for they are
      worshippers of Mahound, and endure not Christian men. And they love not
      them that cut their throats, and burn their country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they of Muscovy ben Devyls, und they ben subtle for to make a thing
      seme otherwise than it is, for to deceive mankind. Wherefore Englishmen
      putten no trust in them of Muscovy, save only the Englishmen ciept
      Radicals, for they make as if they loved these Develes, out of the fear
      and dread of war wherein they go, and would be slaves sooner than fight.
      But the folk of Ynde know not what shall befall, nor whether they of
      Muscovy will take the Lond, or Englishmen shall keep it, so that their
      hearts may not enduren for drede. And methinks that soon shall Englishmen
      and Muscovy folk put their bodies in adventure, and war one with another,
      and all for the way to Ynde.
    </p>
    <p>
      But St. George for Englond, I say, and so enough; and may the Seyntes hele
      thee, Sir John, of thy Gowtes Artetykes, that thee tormenten. But to thy
      Boke I list not to give no credence.

    <h2>
      XII. To Alexandre Dumas.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;There are moments when the wheels of life, even of such a life
      as yours, run slow, and when mistrust and doubt overshadow even the most
      intrepid disposition. In such a moment, towards the ending of your days,
      you said to your son, M. Alexandre Dumas, 'I seem to see myself set on a
      pedestal which trembles as if it were founded on the sands.' These sands,
      your uncounted volumes, are all of gold, and make a foundation more solid
      than the rock. As well might the singer of Odysseus, or the authors of the
      'Arabian Nights', or the first inventors of the stories of Boccaccio,
      believe that their works were perishable (their names, indeed, have
      perished), as the creator of 'Les Trois Mousquetaires' alarm himself with
      the thought that the world could ever forget Alexandre Dumas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Than yours there has been no greater nor more kindly and beneficent force
      in modern letters. To Scott, indeed, you owed the first impulse of your
      genius; but, once set in motion, what miracles could it not accomplish?
      Our dear Porthos was overcome, at last, by a superhuman burden; but your
      imaginative strength never found a task too great for it. What an
      extraordinary vigour, what health, what an overflow of force was yours! It
      is good, in a day of small and laborious ingenuities, to breathe the free
      air of your books, and dwell in the company of Dumas's men&mdash;so
      gallant, so frank, so indomitable, such swordsmen, and such trenchermen.
      Like M. de Rochefort in 'Vingt Ans Aprés,' like that prisoner of the
      Bastille, your genius 'n'est que d'un parti, c'est du parti du grand air.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There seems to radiate from you a still persistent energy and enjoyment;
      in that current of strength not only your characters live, frolic, kindly,
      and sane, but even your very collaborators were animated by the virtue
      which went out of you. How else can we explain it, the dreary charge which
      feeble and envious tongues have brought against you, in England and at
      home? They say you employed in your novels and dramas that vicarious aid
      which, in the slang of the studio, the 'sculptor's ghost' is fabled to
      afford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, let it be so; these ghosts, when uninspired by you, were faint and
      impotent as 'the strengthless tribes of the dead' in Homer's Hades, before
      Odysseus had poured forth the blood that gave them a momentary valour. It
      was from you and your inexhaustible vitality that these collaborating
      spectres drew what life they possessed; and when they parted from you they
      shuddered back into their nothingness. Where are the plays, where the
      romances which Maquet and the rest wrote in their own strength? They are
      forgotten with last year's snows; they have passed into the wide
      waste-paper basket of the world. You say of D'Artagnan, when severed from
      his three friends&mdash;from Porthos, Athos, and Aramis&mdash;'he felt
      that he could do nothing, save on the condition that each of these
      companions yielded to him, if one may so speak, a share of that electric
      fluid which was his gift from heaven.'
    </p>
    <p>
      No man of letters ever had so great a measure of that gift as you; none
      gave of it more freely to all who came&mdash;to the chance associate of
      the hour, as to the characters, all so burly and full-blooded, who flocked
      from your brain. Thus it was that you failed when you approached the
      supernatural. Your ghosts had too much flesh and blood, more than the
      living persons of feebler fancies. A writer so fertile, so rapid, so
      masterly in the ease with which he worked, could not escape the reproaches
      of barren envy. Because you overflowed with wit, you could not be
      'serious;' Because you created with a word, you were said to scamp your
      work; because you were never dull, never pedantic, incapable of greed, you
      were to be censured as desultory, inaccurate, and prodigal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A generation suffering from mental and physical anaemia&mdash;a generation
      devoted to the 'chiselled phrase,' to accumulated 'documents,' to
      microscopic porings over human baseness, to minute and disgustful records
      of what in humanity is least human&mdash;may readily bring these
      unregarded and railing accusations. Like one of the great and
      good-humoured Giants of Rabelais, you may hear the murmurs from afar, and
      smile with disdain. To you, who can amuse the world&mdash;to you who offer
      it the fresh air of the highway, the battle-field, and the sea&mdash;the
      world must always return, escaping gladly from the boudoirs and the <i>bouges</i>,
      from the surgeries and hospitals, and dead rooms, of M. Daudet and M. Zola
      and of the wearisome De Goncourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all your frankness, and with that queer morality of the Camp which,
      if it swallows a camel now and again, never strains at a gnat, how healthy
      and wholesome, and even pure, are your romances! You never gloat over sin,
      nor dabble with an ugly curiosity in the corruptions of sense. The
      passions in your tales are honourable and brave, the motives are clearly
      human. Honour, Love, Friendship make the threefold cord, the clue your
      knights and dames follow through how delightful a labyrinth of adventures!
      Your greatest books, I take the liberty to maintain, are the Cycle of the
      Valois ('La Reine Margot, 'La Dame de Montsoreau,' 'Les Quarante-cinq'),
      and the Cycle of Louis Treize and Louis Quatorze ('Les Trois
      Mousquetaires,' 'Vingt Ans Aprés,' 'Le Vicomte de Bragelonné); and, beside
      these two trilogies&mdash;a lonely monument, like the sphinx hard by the
      three pyramids&mdash;'Monte Cristo.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In these romances how easy it would have been for you to burn incense to
      that great goddess, Lubricity, whom our critic says your people worship.
      You had Branto'me, you had Tallemant, you had Rétif, and a dozen others,
      to furnish materials for scenes of voluptuousness and of blood that would
      have outdone even the present <i>naturalistes</i>. From these alcoves of
      'Les Dames Galantes,' and from the torture chambers (M. Zola would not
      have spared us one starting sinew of brave La Mole on the rack) you
      turned, as Scott would have turned, without a thought of their profitable
      literary uses. You had other metal to work on: you gave us that
      superstitious and tragical true love of La Molés, that devotion&mdash;how
      tender and how pure!&mdash;of Bussy for the Dame de Montsoreau. You gave
      us the valour of D'Artagnan, the strength of Porthos, the melancholy
      nobility of Athos: Honour, Chivalry, and Friendship. I declare your
      characters are real people to me and old friends. I cannot bear to read
      the end of 'Bragelonne,' and to part with them for ever. 'Suppose Perthos,
      Athos, and Aramis should enter with a noiseless swagger, curling their
      moustaches.' How we would welcome them, forgiving D'Artagnan even his
      hateful <i>fourberie</i> in the case of Milady. The brilliance of your
      dialogue has never been approached: there is wit everywhere; repartees
      glitter and ring like the flash and clink of small-swords. Then what duels
      are yours! and what inimitable battle-pieces! I know four good fights of
      one against a multitude, in literature. These are the Death of Gretir the
      Strong, the Death of Gunnar of Lithend, the Death of Hereward the Wake,
      the Death of Bussy d'Amboise. We can compare the strokes of the heroic
      fighting-times with those described in later days; and, upon my word, I do
      not know that the short sword of Gretir, or the bill of Skarphedin, or the
      bow of Gunnar was better wielded than the rapier of your Bussy or the
      sword and shield of Kingsley's Hereward.
    </p>
    <p>
      They say your fencing is unhistorical; no doubt it is so, and you knew it.
      La Mole could not have lunged on Coconnas 'after deceiving circle;' for
      the parry was not invented except by your immortal Chicot, a genius in
      advance of his time. Even so Hamlet and Laertes would have fought with
      shields and axes, not with small swords. But what matters this pedantry?
      In your works we hear the Homeric Muse again, rejoicing in the clash of
      steel; and even, at times, your very phrases are unconsciously Homeric.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at these men of murder, on the Eve of St. Bartholomew, who flee in
      terror from the Queen's chamber, and 'find the door too narrow for their
      flight:' the very words were anticipated in a line of the 'Odyssey'
      concerning the massacre of the Wooers. And the picture of Catherine de
      Medicis, prowling 'like a wolf among the bodies and the blood,' in a
      passage of the Louvre&mdash;the picture is taken unwittingly from the
      'Iliad.' There was in you that reserve of primitive force, that epic
      grandeur and simplicity of diction. This is the force that animates 'Monte
      Cristo,' the earlier chapters, the prison, and the escape. In later
      volumes of that romance, methinks, you stoop your wing. Of your dramas I
      have little room, and less skill, to speak. 'Antony,' they tell me, was
      'the greatest literary event of its time,' was a restoration of the stage.
      'While Victor Hugo needs the cast-off clothes of history, the wardrobe and
      costume, the sepulchre of Charlemagne, the ghost of Barbarossa, the
      coffins of Lucretia Borgia, Alexandre Dumas requires no more than a room
      in an inn, where people meet in riding cloaks, to move the soul with the
      last degree of terror and of pity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The reproach of being amusing has somewhat dimmed your fame&mdash;for a
      moment. The shadow of this tyranny will soon be overpast; and when 'La
      Curée and 'Pot-Bouillé are more forgotten than 'Le Grand Cyrus,' men and
      women&mdash;and, above all, boys&mdash;will laugh and weep over the page
      of Alexandre Dumas. Like Scott himself, you take us captive in our
      childhood. I remember a very idle little boy who was busy with the 'Three
      Musketeers' when he should have been occupied with 'Wilkins's Latin
      Prose.' 'Twenty years after' (alas and more) he is still constant to that
      gallant company; and, at this very moment, is breathlessly wondering
      whether Grimand will steal M. de Beaufort out of the Cardinal's prison.

    <h2>
      XIII. To Theocritus
    </h2>
    <p>
      'Sweet, methinks, is the whispering sound of yonder pine-tree,' so,
      Theocritus, with that sweet word <i>ade</i>*, didst thou begin and strike
      the keynote of thy songs. 'Sweet,' and didst thou find aught of sweet,
      when thou, like thy Daphnis, didst 'go down the stream, when the whirling
      wave closed over the man the Muses loved, the man not hated of the
      Nymphs?' Perchance below those waters of death thou didst find, like thine
      own Hylas, the lovely Nereids waiting thee, Eunice, and Malis, and Nycheia
      with her April eyes. In the House of Hades, Theocritus, doth there dwell
      aught that is fair, and can the low light on the fields of asphodel make
      thee forget thy Sicily? Nay, methinks thou hast not forgotten, and
      perchance for poets dead there is prepared a place more beautiful than
      their dreams. It was well for the later minstrels of another day, it was
      well for Ronsard and Du Bellay to desire a dim Elysium of their own, where
      the sunlight comes faintly through the shadow of the earth, where the
      poplars are duskier, and the waters more pale than in the meadows of
      Anjou.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Transliterated.
</pre>
    <p>
      There, in that restful twilight, far remote from war and plot, from sword
      and fire, and from religions that sharpened the steel and lit the torch,
      there these learned singers would fain have wandered with their learned
      ladies, satiated with life and in love with an unearthly quiet. But to
      thee, Theocritus, no twilight of the Hollow Land was dear, but the high
      suns of Sicily and the brown cheeks of the country maidens were happiness
      enough. For thee, therefore, methinks, surely is reserved an Elysium
      beneath the summer of a far-off system, with stars not ours and alien
      seasons. There, as Bion prayed, shall Spring, the thrice desirable, be
      with thee the whole year through, where there is neither frost, nor is the
      heat so heavy on men, but all is fruitful, and all sweet things blossom,
      and evenly meted are darkness and dawn. Space is wide, and there be many
      worlds, and suns enow, and the Sun-god surely has had a care of his own.
      Little didst thou need, in thy native land, the isle of the three capes,
      little didst thou need but sunlight on land and sea. Death can have shown
      thee naught dearer than the fragrant shadow of the pines, where the dry
      needles of the fir are strewn, or glades where feathered ferns make 'a
      couch more soft than Sleep.' The short grass of the cliffs, too, thou
      didst love, where thou wouldst lie, and watch, with the tunny watcher till
      the deep blue sea was broken by the burnished sides of the tunny shoal,
      and afoam with their gambols in the brine. There the Muses met thee, and
      the Nymphs, and there Apollo, remembering his old thraldom with Admetus,
      would lead once more a mortal's flocks, and listen and learn, Theocritus,
      while thou, like thine own Comatas, 'didst sweetly sing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There, methinks, I see thee as in thy happy days, 'reclined on deep beds
      of fragrant lentisk, lowly strewn, and rejoicing in new stript leaves of
      the vine, while far above thy head waved many a poplar, many an elm-tree,
      and close at hand the sacred waters sang from the mouth of the cavern of
      the nymphs.' And when night came, methinks thou wouldst flee from the
      merry company and the dancing girls, from the fading crowds of roses or
      white violets, from the cottabos, and the minstrelsy, and the Bibline
      wine, from these thou wouldst slip away into the summer night. Then the
      beauty of life and of the summer would keep thee from thy couch, and
      wandering away from Syracuse by the sandhills and the sea, thou wouldst
      watch the low cabin, roofed with grass, where the fishing-rods of reed
      were leaning against the door, while the Mediterranean floated up her
      waves, and filled the waste with sound. There didst thou see thine ancient
      fishermen rising ere the dawn from their bed of dry sea-weed, and heardst
      them stirring, drowsy, among their fishing gear, and heardst them tell
      their dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or again thou wouldst wander with dusty feet through the ways that the
      dust makes silent, while the breath of the kine, as they were driven forth
      with the morning, came fresh to thee, and the trailing dewy branch of
      honeysuckle struck sudden on thy cheek. Thou wouldst see the Dawn awake in
      rose and saffron across the waters, and Etna, grey and pale against the
      sky, and the setting crescent would dip strangely in the glow, on her way
      to the sea. Then, methinks, thou wouldst murmur, like thine own Simaetha,
      the love-lorn witch, 'Farewell, Selene, bright and fair; farewell, ye
      other stars, that follow the wheels of the quiet Night.' Nay, surely it
      was in such an hour that thou didst behold the girl as she burned the
      laurel leaves and the barley grain, and melted the waxen image, and called
      on Selene to bring her lover home. Even so, even now, in the islands of
      Greece, the setting Moon may listen to the prayers of maidens. 'Bright
      golden Moon, that now art near the waters, go thou and salute my lover, he
      that stole my love, and that kissed me, saying "Never will I leave thee."
      And lo, he hath left me as men leave a field reaped and gleaned, like a
      church where none cometh to pray, like a city desolate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So the girls still sing in Greece, for though the Temples have fallen, and
      the wandering shepherds sleep beneath the broken columns of the god's
      house in Selinus, yet these ancient fires burn still to the old divinities
      in the shrines of the hearths of the peasants. It is none of the new
      creeds that cry, in the dirge of the Sicilian shepherds of our time, 'Ah,
      light of mine eyes, what gift shall I send thee, what offering to the
      other world? The apple fadeth, the quince decayeth, and one by one they
      perish, the petals of the rose. I will send thee my tears shed on a
      napkin, and what though it burneth in the flame, if my tears reach thee at
      the last.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, little is altered, Theocritus, on these shores beneath the sun, where
      thou didst wear a tawny skin stripped from the roughest of he-goats, and
      about thy breast an old cloak buckled with a plaited belt. Thou wert
      happier there, in Sicily, methinks, and among vines and shadowy lime-trees
      of Cos, than in the dust, and heat, and noise of Alexandria. What love of
      fame, what lust of gold tempted thee away from the red cliffs, and grey
      olives, and wells of black water wreathed with maidenhair?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The music of the rustic flute
  Kept not for long its happy country tone;
  Lost it too soon, and learned a stormy note
  Of men contention tost, of men who groan,
  Which tasked thy pipe too sore, and tired thy throat&mdash;
  It failed, and thou wast mute!

 What hadst <i>thou</i> to make in cities, and what could Ptolemies and Princes
give thee better than the goat-milk cheese and the Ptelean wine? Thy
Muses were meant to be the delight of peaceful men, not of tyrants and
wealthy merchants, to whom they vainly went on a begging errand. 'Who
will open his door and gladly receive our Muses within his house, who is
there that will not send them back again without a gift? And they with
naked feet and looks askance come homewards, and sorely they upbraid me
when they have gone on a vain journey, and listless again in the bottom
of their empty coffer they dwell with heads bowed over their chilly
knees, where is their drear abode, when portionless they return.' How
far happier was the prisoned goat-herd, Comatas, in the fragrant cedar
chest where the blunt-faced bees from the meadow fed him with food of
tender flowers, because still the Muse dropped sweet nectar on his lips!
</pre>
    <p>
      Thou didst leave the neat-herds and the kine, and the oaks of Himera, the
      galingale hummed over by the bees, and the pine that dropped her cones,
      and Amaryllis in her cave, and Bombyca with her feet of carven ivory. Thou
      soughtest the City, and strife with other singers, and the learned write
      still on thy quarrels with Apollonius and Callimachus, and Antagoras of
      Rhodes. So ancient are the hatreds of poets, envy, jealousy, and all
      unkindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to the wits of Courts couldst thou teach thy rural song, though all
      these centuries, more than two thousand years, they have laboured to vie
      with thee. There has come no new pastoral poet, though Virgil copied thee,
      and Pope, and Phillips, and all the buckram band of the teacup time; and
      all the modish swains of France have sung against thee, as the <i>son
      challenged Athene</i>. They never knew the shepherd's life, the long'
      winter nights on dried heather by the fire, the long summer days, when
      over the dry grass all is quiet, and only the insects hum, and the
      shrunken burn whispers a silver tune. Swains in high-heeled shoon, and
      lace, shepherdesses in rouge and diamonds, the world is weary of all
      concerning them, save their images in porcelain, effigies how unlike the
      golden figures, dedicate to Aphrodite, of Bombyca and Battus. Somewhat,
      Theocritus, thou hast to answer for, thou that first of men brought the
      shepherd to Court, and made courtiers wild to go a Maying with the
      shepherds.

    <h2>
      XIV. To Edgar Allan Poe.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;Your English readers, better acquainted with your poems and
      romances than with your criticisms, have long wondered at the
      indefatigable hatred which pursues your memory. You, who knew the men,
      will not marvel that certain microbes of letters, the survivors of your
      own generation, still harass your name with their malevolence, while old
      women twitter out their incredible and heeded slanders in the literary
      papers of New York. But their persistent animosity does not quite suffice
      to explain the dislike with which many American critics regard the
      greatest poet, perhaps the greatest literary genius, of their country.
      With a commendable patriotism, they are not apt to rate native merit too
      low; and you, I think, are the only example of an American prophet almost
      without honour in his own country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recent publication of a cold, careful, and in many respects admirable
      study of your career ('Edgar Allan Poe,' by George Woodberry: Houghton,
      Mifflin and Co., Boston) reminds English readers who have forgotten it,
      and teaches those who never knew it, that you were, unfortunately, a
      Reviewer. How unhappy were the necessities, how deplorable the vein, that
      compelled or seduced a man of your eminence into the dusty and stony ways
      of contemporary criticism! About the writers of his own generation a
      leader of that generation should hold his peace, he should neither praise
      nor blame nor defend his equals; he should not strike one blow at the
      buzzing ephemerae of letters. The breath of their life is in the columns
      of 'Literary Gossip;' and they should be allowed to perish with the weekly
      advertisements on which they pasture. Reviewing, of course, there must
      needs be; but great minds should only criticise the great who have passed
      beyond the reach of eulogy or fault-finding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily, taste and circumstances combined to make you a censor; you
      vexed a continent, and you are still unforgiven. What 'irritation of a
      sensitive nature, chafed by some indefinite sense of wrong,' drove you (in
      Mr. Longfellow's own words) to attack his pure and beneficent Muse we may
      never ascertain. But Mr. Longfellow forgave you easily; for pardon comes
      easily to the great. It was the smaller men, the Daweses, Griswolds, and
      the like, that knew not how to forget. 'The New Yorkers never forgave
      him,' says your latest biographer; and one scarcely marvels at the
      inveteracy of their malice. It was not individual vanity alone, but the
      whole literary class that you assailed. 'As a literary people,' you wrote,
      'we are one vast perambulating humbug.' After that declaration of war you
      died, and left your reputation to the vanities yet writhing beneath your
      scorn. They are writhing and writing still. He who knows them need not
      linger over the attacks and defences of your personal character; he will
      not waste time on calumnies, tale-bearing, private letters, and all the
      noisome dust which takes so long in settling above your tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      For us it is enough to know that you were compelled to live by your pen,
      and that in an age when the author of 'To Helen' and' The Cask of
      Amontillado' was paid at the rate of a dollar a column. When such poverty
      was the mate of such pride as yours, a misery more deep than that of
      Burns, an agony longer than Chatterton's, were inevitable and assured. No
      man was less fortunate than you in the moment of his birth&mdash;<i>infelix
      opportunitate vitae</i>. Had you lived a generation later, honour, wealth,
      applause, success in Europe and at home, would all have been yours. Within
      thirty years so great a change has passed over the profession of letters
      in America; and it is impossible to estimate the rewards which would have
      fallen to Edgar Poe, had chance made him the contemporary of Mark Twain
      and of 'Called Back.' It may be that your criticisms helped to bring in
      the new era, and to lift letters out of the reach of quite unlettered
      scribblers. Though not a scholar, at least you had a respect for
      scholarship. You might still marvel over such words as 'objectional' in
      the new biography of yourself, and might ask what is meant by such a
      sentence as 'his connection with it had inured to his own benefit by the
      frequent puffs of himself,' and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Best known in your own day as a critic, it is as a poet and a writer of
      short tales that you must live. But to discuss your few and elaborate
      poems is a waste of time, so completely does your own brief definition of
      poetry, 'the rhythmic creation of the beautiful,' exhaust your theory, and
      so perfectly is the theory illustrated by the poems. Natural bent, and
      reaction against the example of Mr. Longfellow, combined to make you too
      intolerant of what you call the 'didactic' element in verse. Even if
      morality be not seven-eighths of our life (the exact proportion as at
      present estimated), there was a place even on the Hellenic Parnassus for
      gnomic bards, and theirs in the nature of the case must always be the
      largest public.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Music is the perfection of the soul or the idea of poetry,' so you wrote;
      'the vagueness of exaltation aroused by a sweet air (which should be
      indefinite and never too strongly suggestive), is precisely what we should
      aim at in poetry.' You aimed at that mark, and struck it again and again,
      notably in 'Helen, thy beauty is to me,' in 'The Haunted Palace,' 'The
      Valley of Unrest,' and 'The City in the Sea.' But by some Nemesis which
      might, perhaps, have been foreseen, you are, to the world, the poet of one
      poem&mdash;'The Raven:' a piece in which the music is highly artificial,
      and the 'exaltation' (what there is of it) by no means particularly
      'vague.' So a portion of the public know little of Shelley but the
      'Skylark,' and those two incongruous birds, the lark and the raven, bear
      each of them a poet's name <i>vivu' per ora virum</i>. Your theory of
      poetry, if accepted, would make you (after the author of 'Kubla Khan') the
      foremost of the poets of the world; at no long distance would come Mr.
      William Morris as he was when he wrote 'Golden Wings,' 'The Blue Closet,'
      and 'The Sailing of the Sword;' and, close up, Mr. Lear, the author of
      'The Yongi Bongi Bo,' and the lay of the 'Jumblies.'
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand Homer would sink into the limbo to which you consigned
      Moliére. If we may judge a theory by its results, when compared with the
      deliberate verdict of the world, your aesthetic does not seem to hold
      water. The 'Odyssey' is not really inferior to 'Ulalume,' as it ought to
      be if your doctrine of poetry were correct, nor 'Le Festin de Pierré to
      'Undine.' Yet you deserve the praise of having been constant, in your
      poetic practice, to your poetic principles&mdash;principles commonly
      deserted by poets who, like Wordsworth, have published their aesthetic
      system. Your pieces are few; and Dr. Johnson would have called you, like
      Fielding, 'a barren rascal.' But how can a writer's verses be numerous if
      with him, as with you, 'poetry is not a pursuit but a passion... which
      cannot at will be excited with an eye to the paltry compensations or the
      more paltry commendations of mankind!' Of you it may be said, more truly
      than Shelley said it of himself, that 'to ask you for anything human, is
      like asking at a gin-shop for a leg of mutton.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humanity must always be, to the majority of men, the true stuff of poetry;
      and only a minority will thank you for that rare music which (like the
      strains of the fiddler in the story) is touched on a single string, and on
      an instrument fashioned from the spoils of the grave. You chose, or you
      were destined
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   To vary from the kindly race of men;
</pre>
    <p>
      and the consequences, which wasted your life, pursue your reputation. For
      your stories has been reserved a boundless popularity, and that highest
      success&mdash;the success of a perfectly sympathetic translation. By this
      time, of course, you have made the acquaintance of your translator, M.
      Charles Baudelaire, who so strenuously shared your views about Mr. Emerson
      and the Transcendentalists, and who so energetically resisted all those
      ideas of 'progress' which 'came from Hell or Boston.' On this point,
      however, the world continues to differ from you and M. Baudelaire, and
      perhaps there is only the choice between our optimism and universal
      suicide or universal opium-eating. But to discuss your ultimate ideas is
      perhaps a profitless digression from the topic of your prose romances.
    </p>
    <p>
      An English critic (probably a Northerner at heart) has described them as
      'Hawthorne and delirium tremens.' I am not aware that extreme orderliness,
      masterly elaboration, and unchecked progress towards a predetermined
      effect are characteristics of the visions of delirium. If they be, then
      there is a deal of truth in the criticism, and a good deal of delirium
      tremens in your style. But your ingenuity, your completeness, your
      occasional luxuriance of fancy and wealth of jewel-like words, are not,
      perhaps, gifts which Mr. Hawthorne had at his command. He was a great
      writer&mdash;the greatest writer in prose fiction whom America has
      produced. But you and he have not much in common, except a certain
      mortuary turn of mind and a taste for gloomy allegories about the workings
      of conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I forbear to anticipate your verdict about the latest essays of American
      fiction. These by no means follow in the lines which you laid down about
      brevity and the steady working to one single effect. Probably you would
      not be very tolerant (tolerance was not your leading virtue) of Mr. Roe,
      now your countrymen's favourite novelist. He is long, he is didactic, he
      is eminently uninspired. In the works of one who is, what you were called
      yourself, a Bostonian, you would admire, at least, the acute observation,
      the subtlety, and the unfailing distinction. But, destitute of humour as
      you unhappily but undeniably were, you would miss, I fear, the charm of
      'Daisy Miller.' You would admit the unity of effect secured in 'Washington
      Square,' though that effect is as remote as possible from the terror of
      'The House of Usher' or the vindictive triumph of 'The Cask of
      Amontillado.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Farewell, farewell, thou sombre and solitary spirit: a genius tethered to
      the hack-work of the press, a gentleman among <i>canaille</i>, a poet
      among poetasters, dowered with a scholar's taste without a scholar's
      training, embittered by his sensitive scorn, and all unsupported by his
      consolations.

      XV. To Sir Walter Scott, Bart.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                  Rodono, St. Mary's Loch:
                  Sept. 5, 1885.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;In your biography it is recorded that you not only won the
      favour of all men and women; but that a domestic fowl conceived an
      affection for you, and that a pig, by his will, had never been severed
      from your company. If some Circe had repeated in my case her favourite
      miracle of turning mortals into swine, and had given me a choice, into
      that fortunate pig, blessed among his race, would I have been converted!
      You, almost alone among men of letters, still, like a living friend, win
      and charm us out of the past; and if one might call up a poet, as the
      scholiast tried to call Homer, from the shades, who would not, out of all
      the rest, demand some hours of your society? Who that ever meddled with
      letters, what child of the irritable race, possessed even a tithe of your
      simple manliness, of the heart that never knew a touch of jealousy, that
      envied no man his laurels, that took honour and wealth as they came, but
      never would have deplored them had you missed both and remained but the
      Border sportsman and the Border antiquary?
    </p>
    <p>
      Were the word 'genial' not so much profaned, were it not misused in easy
      good-nature, to extenuate lettered and sensual indolence, that worn old
      term might be applied, above all men, to 'the Shirra.' But perhaps we
      scarcely need a word (it would be seldom in use) for a character so rare,
      or rather so lonely, in its nobility and charm as that of Walter Scott.
      Here, in the heart of your own country, among your own grey
      round-shouldered hills (each so like the other that the shadow of one
      falling on its neighbour exactly outlines that neighbour's shape), it is
      of you and of your works that a native of the Forest is most frequently
      brought in mind. All the spirits of the river and the hill, all the dying
      refrains of ballad and the fading echoes of story, all the memory of the
      wild past, each legend of burn and loch, seem to have combined to inform
      your spirit, and to secure themselves an immortal life in your song. It is
      through you that we remember them; and in recalling them, as in treading
      each hillside in this land, we again remember you and bless you.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not 'Sixty Years Since' the echo of Tweed among his pebbles fell for
      the last time on your ear; not sixty years since, and how much is altered!
      But two generations have passed; the lad who used to ride from Edinburgh
      to Abbotsford, carrying new books for you, and old, is still vending, in
      George Street, old books and new. Of politics I have not the heart to
      speak. Little joy would you have had in most that has befallen since the
      Reform Bill was passed, to the chivalrous cry of 'burke Sir Walter.' We
      are still very Radical in the Forest, and you were taken away from many
      evils to come. How would the cheek of Walter Scott, or of Leyden, have
      blushed at the names of Majuba, The Soudan, Maiwand, and many others that
      recall political cowardice or military incapacity! On the other hand, who
      but you could have sung the dirge of Gordon, or wedded with immortal verse
      the names of Hamilton (who fell with Cavagnari), of the two Stewarts, of
      many another clansman, brave among the bravest! Only he who told how

<pre xml:space="preserve">

      Much is changed, in the country-side as well as in the country; but much
      remains. The little towns of your time are populous and excessively black
      with the smoke of factories&mdash;not, I fear, at present very
      flourishing. In Galashiels you still see the little change-house and the
      cluster of cottages round the Laird's lodge, like the clachan of Tully
      Veolan. But these plain remnants of the old Scotch towns are almost buried
      in a multitude of 'smoky dwarf houses'&mdash;a living poet, Mr. Matthew
      Arnold, has found the fitting phrase for these dwellings, once for all.
      All over the Forest he waters are dirty and poisoned: I think they are
      filthiest below Hawick; but this may be mere local prejudice in a Selkirk
      man. To keep them clean costs money; and, though improvements are often
      promised, I cannot see much change for the better. Abbotsford, luckily, is
      above Galashiels, and only receives the dirt and dyes of Selkirk, Peebles,
      Walkerburn, and Innerlethen. On the other hand, your ill-omened later
      dwelling, 'the unhappy palace of your race,' is overlooked by villas that
      prick a cockney ear among their larches, hotels of the future. Ah, Sir,
      Scotland is a strange place. Whisky is exiled from some of our
      caravanserais, and they have banished Sir John Barleycorn. It seems as if
      the views of the excellent critic (who wrote your life lately, and said
      you had left no descendants, <i>le pauvre homme</i>) were beginning to
      prevail. This pious biographer was greatly shocked by that capital story
      about the keg of whisky that arrived at the Liddesdale farmer's during
      family prayers. Your Toryism also was an offence to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among these vicissitudes of things and the overthrow of customs, let us be
      thankful that, beyond the reach of the manufacturers, the Border country
      remains as kind and homely as ever. I looked at Ashiestiel some days ago:
      the house seemed just as it may have been when you left it for Abbotsford,
      only there was a lawn-tennis net on the lawn, the hill on the opposite
      bank of the Tweed was covered to the crest with turnips, and the burn did
      not sing below the little bridge, for in this arid summer the burn was
      dry. But there was still a grilse that rose to a big March brown in the
      shrunken stream below Elibank. This may not interest you, who styled
      yourself

      Still, as when you were thinking over Marmion, a man might have 'grand
      gallops among the hills'&mdash;those grave wastes of heather and bent that
      sever all the watercourses and roll their sheep-covered pastures from
      Dollar Law to White Combe, and from White Combe to the Three Brethren
      Cairn and the Windburg and Skelf-hill Pen. Yes, Teviotdale is pleasant
      still, and there is not a drop of dye in the water, <i>purior electro</i>,
      of Yarrow. St. Mary's Loch lies beneath me, smitten with wind and rain&mdash;the
      St. Mary's of North and of the Shepherd. Only the trout, that see a myriad
      of artificial flies, are shyer than of yore. The Shepherd could no longer
      fill a cart up Meggat with trout so much of a size that the country people
      took them for herrings.

      The grave of Piers Cockburn is still not desecrated: hard by it lies,
      within a little wood; and beneath that slab of old sandstone, and the
      graven letters, and the sword and shield, sleep 'Piers Cockburn and
      Marjory his wife.' Not a hundred yards off was the castle door where they
      hanged him; this is the tomb of the ballad, and the lady that buried him
      rests now with her wild lord.

      Here too hearts have broken, and there is a sacredness in the shadow and

    <h2>
      XVI. To Eusebius of Caesarea.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (Concerning the Gods of the Heathen.)
    </h3>
    <p>
      Touching the Gods of the Heathen, most reverend Father, thou art not
      ignorant that even now, as in the time of thy probation on earth, there is
      great dissension. That these feigned Deities and idols, the work of men's
      hands, are no longer worshipped thou knowest; neither do men eat meat
      offered to idols. Even as spoke that last Oracle which murmured forth, the
      latest and the only true voice from Delphi, even so 'the fair-wrought
      court divine hath fallen; no more hath Phoebus his home, no more his
      laurel-bough, nor the singing well of water; nay, the sweet-voiced water
      is silent.' The fane is ruinous, and the images of men's idolatry are
      dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, most worshipful, men do still dispute about the beginnings
      of those sinful Gods: such as Zeus, Athene, and Dionysus: and marvel how
      first they won their dominion over the souls of the foolish peoples. Now,
      concerning these things there is not one belief, but many; howbeit, there
      are two main kinds of opinion. One sect of philosophers believes&mdash;as
      thyself, with heavenly learning, didst not vainly persuade&mdash;that the
      Gods were the inventions of wild and bestial folk, who, long before cities
      were builded or life was honourably ordained, fashioned forth evil spirits
      in their own savage likeness; ay, or in the likeness of the very beasts
      that perish. To this judgment, as it is set forth in thy Book of the
      Preparation for the Gospel, I, humble as I am, do give my consent. But on
      the other side are many and learned men, chiefly of the tribes of the
      Alemanni, who have almost conquered the whole inhabited world. These,
      being unwilling to suppose that the Hellenes were in bondage to
      superstitions handed down from times of utter darkness and a bestial life,
      do chiefly hold with the heathen philosophers, even with the writers whom
      thou, most venerable, didst confound with thy wisdom and chasten with the
      scourge of small cords of thy wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, like the heathen, our doctors and teachers maintain that the Gods of
      the nations were, in the beginning, such pure natural creatures as the
      blue sky, the sun, the air, the bright dawn, and the fire; but, as time
      went on, men, forgetting the meaning of their own speech and no longer
      understanding the tongue of their own fathers, were misled and beguiled
      into fashioning all those lamentable tales: as that Zeus, for love of
      mortal women, took the shape of a bull, a ram, a serpent, an ant, an
      eagle, and sinned in such wise as it is a shame even to speak of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold, then, most worshipful, how these doctors and learned men argue,
      even like the philosophers of the heathen whom thou didst confound. For
      they declare the Gods to have been natural elements, sun and sky and
      storm, even as did thy opponents; and, like them, as thou saidst, 'they
      are nowise at one with each other in their explanations.' For of old some
      boasted that Hera was the Air; and some that she signified the love of
      woman and man; and some that she was the waters above the Earth; and
      others that she was the Earth beneath the waters; and yet others that she
      was the Night, for that Night is the shadow of Earth: as if, forsooth, the
      men who first worshipped Hera had understanding of these things! And when
      Hera and Zeus quarrel unseemly (as Homer declareth), this meant (said the
      learned in thy days) no more than the strife and confusion of the
      elements, and was not in the beginning an idle slanderous tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all which, most worshipful, thou didst answer wisely: saying that Hera
      could not be both night, and earth, and water, and air, and the love of
      sexes, and the confusion of the elements; but that all these opinions were
      vain dreams, and the guesses of the learned. And why&mdash;thou saidst&mdash;even
      if the Gods were pure natural creatures, are such foul things told of them
      in the Mysteries as it is not fitting for me to declare. 'These
      wanderings, and drinkings, and loves, and corruptions, that would be
      shameful in men, why,' thou saidst, 'were they attributed to the natural
      elements; and wherefore did the Gods constantly show themselves, like the
      sorcerers called were-wolves, in the shape of the perishable beasts?' But,
      mainly, thou didst argue that, till the philosophers of the heathen were
      agreed among themselves, not all contradicting each the other, they had no
      semblance of a sure foundation for their doctrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all this and more, most worshipful Father, I know not what the heathen
      answered thee. But, in our time, the learned men who stand to it that the
      heathen Gods were in the beginning the pure elements, and that the
      nations, forgetting their first love and the significance of their own
      speech, became confused and were betrayed into foul stories about the pure
      Gods&mdash;these learned men, I say, agree no whit among themselves. Nay,
      they differ one from another, not less than did Plutarch and Porphyry and
      Theagenes, and the rest whom thou didst laugh to scorn. Bear with me,
      Father, while I tell thee how the new Plutarchs and Porphyrys do contend
      among themselves; and yet these differences of theirs they call 'Science'!
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the goddess Athene, who sprang armed from the head of Zeus, even
      as&mdash;among the fables of the poor heathen folk of seas thou never
      knewest&mdash;goddesses are fabled to leap out from the armpits or feet of
      their fathers. Thou must know that what Plato, in the 'Cratylus,' made
      Socrates say in jest, the learned among us practise in sad earnest. For,
      when they wish to explain the nature of any God, they first examine his
      name, and torment the letters thereof, arranging and altering them
      according to their will, and flying off to the speech of the Indians and
      Medes and Chaldeans, and other Barbarians, if Greek will not serve their
      turn. How saith Socrates? 'I bethink me of a very new and ingenious idea
      that occurs to me; and, if I do not mind, I shall be wiser than I should
      be by to-morrow's dawn. My notion is that we may put in and pull out
      letters at pleasure and alter the accents.' Even so do our learned&mdash;not
      at pleasure, maybe, but according to certain fixed laws (so they declare);
      yet none the more do they agree among themselves. And I deny not that they
      discover many things true and good to be known; but, as touching the names
      of the Gods, their learning, as it standeth, is confusion. Look, then, at
      the goddess Athene: taking one example out of hundreds. We have dwelling
      in our coasts Muellerus, the most erudite of the doctors of the Alemanni,
      and the most golden-mouthed. Concerning Athene, he saith that her name is
      none other than, in the ancient tongue of the Brachmanae, <i>Ahana'</i>,
      which, being interpreted, means the Dawn. 'And that the morning light,'
      saith he, 'offers the best starting-point; for the later growth of Athene
      has been proved, I believe, beyond the reach of doubt or even cavil.' (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) 'The Lesson of Jupiter.'&mdash;<i>Nineteenth Century</i>, October, 1885.
</pre>
    <p>
      Yet this same doctor candidly lets us know that another of his nation, the
      witty Benfeius, hath devised another sense and origin of Athene, taken
      from the speech of the old Medes. But Muellerus declares to us that
      whosoever shall examine the contention of Benfeius 'will be bound, in
      common honesty, to confess that it is untenable.' This, Father, is one for
      Benfeius, as the saying goes. And as Muellerus holds that these matters
      'admit of almost mathematical precision,' it would seem that Benfeius is
      but a <i>Dummkopf</i>, as the Alemanni say, in their own language, when
      they would be pleasant among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, wouldst thou credit it? despite the mathematical plainness of the
      facts, other Alemanni agree neither with Muellerus, nor yet with Benfeius,
      and will neither hear that Athene was the Dawn, nor yet that she is 'the
      feminine of the Zend <i>Thra'eta'na athwya'na</i>.' Lo, you! how Prellerus
      goes about to show that her name is drawn not from <i>Ahana'</i> and the
      old Brachmanae, nor <i>athwya'na</i> and the old Medes, but from 'the root
      <i>aith</i>*, whence <i>aither</i>*, the air, or <i>ath</i>*, whence <i>anthos</i>*,
      a flower.' Yea, and Prellerus will have it that no man knows the verity of
      this matter. None the less he is very bold, and will none of the Dawn; but
      holds to it that Athene was, from the first, 'the clear pure height of the
      Air, which is exceeding pure in Attica.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Father, as if all this were not enough, comes one Roscherus in, with
      a mighty great volume on the Gods, and Furtwaenglerus, among others, for
      his ally. And these doctors will neither with Rueckertus and Hermannus,
      take Athene for 'wisdom in person;' nor with Welckerus and Prellerus, for
      'the goddess of air;' nor even, with Muellerus and mathematical certainty,
      for 'the Morning-Red:' but they say that Athene is the 'black
      thunder-cloud, and the lightning that leapeth therefrom'! I make no doubt
      that other Alemanni are of other minds: <i>quot Alemanni tot sententiae</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yea, as thou saidst of the learned heathen, <i>Oude gar allelois symphona</i>
      <i>physiologousis</i>. Yet these disputes of theirs they call 'Science'!
      But if any man says to the learned: 'Best of men, you are erudite, and
      laborious and witty; but, till you are more of the same mind, your
      opinions cannot be styled knowledge. Nay, they are at present of no avail
      whereon to found any doctrine concerning the Gods'&mdash;that man is
      railed at for his 'mean' and 'weak' arguments.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Transliterated from Greek.
</pre>
    <p>
      Was it thus, Father, that the heathen railed against thee? But I must
      still believe, with thee, that these evil tales of the Gods were invented
      'when man's life was yet brutish and wandering' (as is the life of many
      tribes that even now tell like tales), and were maintained in honour of
      the later Greeks 'because none dared alter the ancient beliefs of his
      ancestors.' Farewell, Father; and all good be with thee, wishes thy
      well-wisher and thy disciple.

    <h2>
      XVII. To Percy Bysshe Shelley.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;In your lifetime on earth you were not more than commonly
      curious as to what was said by 'the herd of mankind,' if I may quote your
      own phrase. It was that of one who loved his fellow-men, but did not in
      his less enthusiastic moments overestimate their virtues and their
      discretion. Removed so far away from our hubbub, and that world where, as
      you say, we 'pursue our serious folly as of old,' you are, one may guess,
      but moderately concerned about the fate of your writings and your
      reputation. As to the first, you have somewhere said, in one of your
      letters, that the final judgment on your merits as a poet is in the hands
      of posterity, and that you fear the verdict will be 'Guilty,' and the
      sentence 'Death.' Such apprehensions cannot have been fixed or frequent in
      the mind of one whose genius burned always with a clearer and steadier
      flame to the last. The jury of which you spoke has met: a mixed jury and a
      merciful. The verdict is 'Well done,' and the sentence Immortality of
      Fame. There have been, there are, dissenters; yet probably they will be
      less and less heard as the years go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      One judge, or juryman, has made up his mind that prose was your true
      province, and that your letters will outlive your lays. I know not whether
      it was the same or an equally well-inspired critic, who spoke of your most
      perfect lyrics (so Beau Brummell spoke of his ill-tied cravats) as 'a
      gallery of your failures.' But the general voice does not echo these
      utterances of a too subtle intellect. At a famous University (not your
      own) once existed a band of men known as 'The Trinity Sniffers.' Perhaps
      the spirit of the sniffer may still inspire some of the jurors who from
      time to time make themselves heard in your case. The 'Quarterly Review', I
      fear, is still unreconciled. It regards your attempts as tainted by the
      spirit of 'The Liberal Movement in English Literature;' and it is
      impossible, alas! to maintain with any success that you were a Throne and
      Altar Tory. At Oxford you are forgiven; and the old rooms where you let
      the oysters burn (was not your founder, King Alfred, once guilty of
      similar negligence?) are now shown to pious pilgrims.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Conservatives, 't is rumoured, are still averse to your opinions, and
      are believed to prefer to yours the works of the Reverend Mr. Keble, and,
      indeed, of the clergy in general. But, in spite of all this, your poems,
      like the affections of the true lovers in Theocritus, are still 'in the
      mouths of all, and chiefly on the lips of the young.' It is in your lyrics
      that you live, and I do not mean that every one could pass an examination
      in the plot of "Prometheus Unbound" Talking of this piece, by the way, a
      Cambridge critic finds that it reveals in you a hankering after life in a
      cave&mdash;doubtless an unconsciously inherited memory from cave-man.
      Speaking of cave-man reminds me that you once spoke of deserting song for
      prose, and of producing a history of the moral, intellectual, and
      political elements in human society, which, we now agree, began, as Asia
      would fain have ended, in a cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately you gave us 'Adonai, and 'Hellas' instead of this treatise,
      and we have now successfully written the natural history of Man for
      ourselves. Science tells us that before becoming cave-dweller he was a
      brute; Experience daily proclaims that he constantly reverts to his
      original condition. <i>L'homme est un méchant animal</i>, in spite of your
      boyish efforts to add pretty girls 'to the list of the good, the
      disinterested, and the free.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, not in the wastes of Speculation, nor the sterile din of Politics,
      were 'the haunts meet for thee.' Watching the yellow bees in the ivy
      bloom, and the reflected pine forest in the water-pools, watching the
      sunset as it faded, and the dawn as it fired, and weaving all fair and
      fleeting things into a tissue where light and music were at one, that was
      the task of Shelley! 'To ask you for anything human,' you said, 'was like
      asking for a leg of mutton at a gin-shop.' Nay, rather, like asking Apollo
      and Hebe, in the Olympian abodes, to give us beef for ambrosia, and port
      for nectar. Each poet gives what he has, and what he can offer; you spread
      before us fairy bread, and enchanted wine, and shall we turn away, with a
      sneer, because, out of all the multitudes of singers, one is spiritual and
      strange, one has seen Artemis unveiled? One, like Anchises, has been
      beloved of the Goddess, and his eyes, when he looks on the common works of
      common men, are, like the eyes of Anchises, blind with excess of light.
      Let Shelley sing of what he saw, what none saw but Shelley!
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the popularity of your poems (the most romantic of things
      didactic), our world is no better than the world you knew. This will
      disappoint you, who had 'a passion for reforming it.' Kings and priests
      are very much where you left them. True, we have a poet who assails them,
      at large, frequently and fearlessly; yet Mr. Swinburne has never, like
      'kind Hunt,' been in prison, nor do we fear for him a charge of treason.
      Moreover, chemical science has discovered new and ingenious ways of
      destroying principalities and powers. You would be interested in the
      methods, but your peaceful Revolutionism, which disdained physical force,
      would regret their application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our foreign affairs are not in a state which even you would consider
      satisfactory; for we have just had to contend with a Revolt of Islam, and
      we still find in Russia exactly the qualities which you recognised and
      described. We have a great statesman whose methods and eloquence somewhat
      resemble those you attribute to Laon and Prince Athanase. Alas! he is a
      youth of more than seventy summers; and not in his time will Prometheus
      retire to a cavern and pass a peaceful millennium in twining buds and
      beams.
    </p>
    <p>
      In domestic affairs most of the Reforms you desired to see have been
      carried. Ireland has received Emancipation, and almost everything else she
      can ask for. I regret to say that she is still unhappy; her wounds
      unstanched, her wrongs unforgiven. At home we have enfranchised the
      paupers, and expect the most happy results. Paupers (as Mr. Gladstone
      says) are 'our own flesh and blood,' and, as we compel them to be
      vaccinated, so we should permit them to vote. Is it a dream that Mr. Jesse
      Collings (how you would have loved that man!) has a Bill for extending the
      priceless boon of the vote to inmates of Pauper Lunatic Asylums? This may
      prove that last element in the Elixir of political happiness which we have
      sought in vain. Atheists, you will regret to hear, are still unpopular;
      but the new Parliament has done something for Mr. Bradlaugh. You should
      have known our Charles while you were in the 'Queen Mab' stage. I fear you
      wandered, later, from his robust condition of intellectual development.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to your private life, many biographers contrive to make public as much
      of it as possible. Your name, even in life, was, alas! a kind of <i>ducdame</i>
      to bring people of no very great sense into your circle. This curious
      fascination has attracted round your memory a feeble folk of commentators,
      biographers, anecdotists, and others of the tribe. They swarm round you
      like carrion-flies round a sensitive plant, like night-birds bewildered by
      the sun. Men of sense and taste have written on you, indeed; but your
      weaker admirers are now disputing as to whether it was your heart, or a
      less dignified and most troublesome organ, which escaped the flames of the
      funeral pyre. These biographers fight terribly among themselves, and
      vainly prolong the memory of 'old unhappy far-off things, and <i>sorrows</i>
      long ago.' Let us leave them and their squabbles over what is unessential,
      their raking up of old letters and old stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town has lately yawned a weary laugh over an enemy of yours, who has
      produced two heavy volumes, styled by him 'The Real Shelley.' The real
      Shelley, it appears, was Shelley as conceived of by a worthy gentleman so
      prejudiced and so skilled in taking up things by the wrong handle that I
      wonder he has not made a name in the exact science of Comparative
      Mythology. He criticises you in the spirit of that Christian Apologist,
      the Englishman who called you 'a damned Atheist' in the post-office at
      Pisa. He finds that you had 'a little turned-up nose,' a feature no less
      important in his system than was the nose of Cleopatra (according to
      Pascal) in the history of the world. To be in harmony with your nose, you
      were a 'phenomenal' liar, an ill-bred, ill-born, profligate, partly
      insane, an evil-tempered monster, a self-righteous person, full of
      self-approbation&mdash;in fact you were the Beast of this pious
      Apocalypse. Your friend Dr. Lind was an embittered and scurrilous
      apothecary, 'a bad old man.' But enough of this inopportune brawler. For
      Humanity, of which you hoped such great things, Science predicts
      extinction in a night of Frost. The sun will grow cold, slowly&mdash;as
      slowly as doom came on Jupiter in your 'Prometheus,' but as surely. If
      this nightmare be fulfilled, perhaps the Last Man, in some fetid hut on
      the ice-bound Equator, will read. by a fading lamp charged with the dregs
      of the oil in his cruse, the poetry of Shelley. So reading, he, the latest
      of his race, will not wholly be deprived of those sights which alone (says
      the nameless Greek) make life worth enduring. In your verse he will have
      sight of sky, and sea, and cloud, the gold of dawn and the gloom of
      earthquake and eclipse, he will be face to face, in fancy, with the great
      powers that are dead, sun, and ocean, and the illimitable azure of the
      heavens. In Shelley's poetry, while Man endures, all those will survive;
      for your 'voice is as the voice of winds and tides,' and perhaps more
      deathless than all of these, and only perishable with the perishing of the
      human spirit.

    <h2>
      XVIII. To Monsieur de Moliére, Valet de Chambre du Roi.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Monsieur,&mdash;With what awe does a writer venture into the presence of
      the great Moliére! As a courtier in your time would scratch humbly (with
      his comb!) at the door of the Grand Monarch, so I presume to draw near
      your dwelling among the Immortals. You, like the king who, among all his
      titles, has now none so proud as that of the friend of Moliére&mdash;you
      found your dominions small, humble, and distracted; you raised them to the
      dignity of an empire: what Louis XIV. did for France you achieved for
      French comedy; and the ba'ton of Scapin still wields its sway though the
      sword of Louis was broken at Blenheim. For the King the Pyrenees, or so he
      fancied, ceased to exist; by a more magnificent conquest you overcame the
      Channel. If England vanquished your country's arms, it was through you
      that France <i>ferum victorem cepit</i>, and restored the dynasty of
      Comedy to the land whence she had been driven. Ever since Dryden borrowed
      'L'Etourdi,' our tardy apish nation has lived (in matters theatrical) on
      the spoils of the wits of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one respect, to be sure, times and manners have altered. While you
      lived, taste kept the French drama pure; and it was the congenial business
      of English playwrights to foist their rustic grossness and their large
      Fescennine jests into the urban page of Moliére. Now they are diversely
      occupied; and it is their affair to lend modesty where they borrow wit,
      and to spare a blush to the cheek of the Lord Chamberlain. But still, as
      has ever been our wont since Etherege saw, and envied, and imitated your
      successes&mdash;still we pilfer the plays of France, and take our <i>bien</i>,
      as you said in your lordly manner, wherever we can find it. We are the
      privateers of the stage; and it is rarely, to be sure, that a comedy
      pleases the town which has not first been 'cut out' from the countrymen of
      Moliére. Why this should be, and what 'tenebriferous star' (as Paracelsus,
      your companion in the 'Dialogues des Morts,' would have believed) thus
      darkens the sun of English humour, we know not; but certainly our
      dependence on France is the sincerest tribute to you. Without you, neither
      Rotrou, nor Corneille, nor 'a wilderness of monkeys' like Scarron, could
      ever have given Comedy to France and restored her to Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we owe to you, Monsieur, the beautiful advent of Comedy, fair and
      beneficent as Peace in the play of Aristophanes, it is still to you that
      we must turn when of comedies we desire the best. If you studied with
      daily and nightly care the works of Plautus and Terence, if you 'let no
      musty <i>bouquin</i> escape you' (so your enemies declared), it was to
      some purpose that you laboured. Shakespeare excepted, you eclipsed all who
      came before you; and from those that follow, however fresh, we turn: we
      turn from Regnard and Beaumarchais, from Sheridan: and Goldsmith, from
      Musset and Pailleron and Labiche, to that crowded world of your creations.
      'Creations' one may well say, for you anticipated Nature herself: you gave
      us, before she did, in Alceste a Rousseau who was a gentleman not a
      lacquey; in a <i>mot</i> of Don Juan's, the secret of the new Religion and
      the watchword of Comte, <i>l'amour de l'humanité</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you where can we find, save in Rabelais, a Frenchman with humour;
      and where, unless it be in Montaigne, the wise philosophy of a secular
      civilisalion? With a heart the most tender, delicate, loving, and
      generous, a heart often in agony and torment, you had to make life
      endurable (we cannot doubt it) without any whisper of promise, or hope, or
      warning from Religion. Yes, in an age when the greatest mind of all, the
      mind of Pascal, proclaimed that the only help was in voluntary blindness,
      that the only chance was to hazard all on a bet at evens, you, Monsieur,
      refused to be blinded, or to pretend to see what you found invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Religion you beheld no promise of help. When the Jesuits and Jansenists
      of your time saw, each of them, in Tartufe the portrait of their rivals
      (as each of the laughable Marquises in your play conceived that you were
      girding at his neighbour), you all the while were mocking every credulous
      excess of Faith. In the sermons preached to Agnés we surely hear your
      private laughter; in the arguments for credulity which are presented to
      Don Juan by his valet we listen to the eternal self-defence of
      superstition. Thus, desolate of belief, you sought for the permanent
      element of life&mdash;precisely where Pascal recognised all that was most
      fleeting and unsubstantial&mdash;in <i>divertissement</i>; in the pleasure
      of looking on, a spectator of the accidents of existence, an observer of
      the follies of mankind. Like the Gods of the Epicurean, you seem to regard
      our life as a play that is played, as a comedy; yet how often the tragic
      note comes in! What pity, and in the laughter what an accent of tears, as
      of rain in the wind! No comedian has been so kindly and human as you; none
      has had a heart, like you, to feel for his butts, and to leave them
      sometimes, in a sense, superior to their tormentors. Sganarelle, M. de
      Pourceaugnac, George Dandin, and the rest&mdash;our sympathy, somehow, is
      with them, after all; and M. de Pourceaugnac is a gentleman, despite his
      misadventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though triumphant Youth and malicious Love in your plays may batter and
      defeat Jealousy and Old Age, yet they have not all the victory, or you did
      not mean that they should win it. They go off with laughter, and their
      victim with a grimace; but in him we, that are past our youth, behold an
      actor in an unending tragedy, the defeat of a generation. Your sympathy is
      not wholly with the dogs that are having their day; you can throw a bone
      or a crust to the dog that has had his, and has been taught that it is
      over and ended. Yourself not unlearned in shame, in jealousy, in endurance
      of the wanton pride of men (how could the poor player and the husband of
      Céliméne be untaught in that experience?), you never sided quite heartily,
      as other comedians have done, with young prosperity and rank and power.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not the first who has dared to approach you in the Shades; for just
      after your own death the author of 'Les Dialogues des Morts' gave you
      Paracelsus as a companion, and the author of 'Le Jugement de Pluton' made
      the 'mighty warder' decide that 'Moliére should not talk philosophy.'
      These writers, like most of us, feel that, after all, the comedies of the
      <i>Contemplateur</i>, of the translator of Lucretius, are a philosophy of
      life in themselves, and that in them we read the lessons of human
      experience writ small and clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      What comedian but Moliére has combined with such depths&mdash;with the
      indignation of Alceste, the self-deception of Tartufe, the blasphemy of
      Don Juan&mdash;such wildness of irresponsible mirth, such humour, such
      wit! Even now, when more than two hundred years have sped by, when so much
      water has flowed under the bridges and has borne away so many trifles of
      contemporary mirth (<i>cetera</i> <i>fluminis ritu feruntur</i>), even now
      we never laugh so well as when Mascarille and Vadius and M. Jourdain tread
      the boards in the Maison de Moliére. Since those mobile dark brows of
      yours ceased to make men laugh, since your voice denounced the 'demoniac'
      manner of contemporary tragedians, I take leave to think that no player
      has been more worthy to wear the <i>canons</i> of Mascarille or the gown
      of Vadius than M. Coquelin of the Comédie Francaise. In him you have a
      successor to your Mascarille so perfect, that the ghosts of play-goers of
      your date might cry, could they see him, that Moliére had come again. But,
      with all respect to the efforts of the fair, I doubt if Mdlle. Barthet, or
      Mdme. Croizette herself, would reconcile the town to the loss of the fair
      De Brie, and Madeleine, and the first, the true Céliméne, Armande. Yet had
      you ever so merry a <i>soubrette</i> as Mdme. Samary, so exquisite a
      Nicole?
    </p>
    <p>
      Denounced, persecuted, and buried hugger-mugger two hundred years ago, you
      are now not over-praised, but more worshipped, with more servility and
      ostentation, studied with more prying curiosity than you may approve. Are
      not the Moliéristes a body who carry adoration to fanaticism? Any scrap of
      your handwriting (so few are these), any anecdote even remotely touching
      on your life, any fact that may prove your house was numbered 15 not 22,
      is eagerly seized and discussed by your too minute historians. Concerning
      your private life, these men often write more like malicious enemies than
      friends; repeating the fabulous scandals of Le Boulanger, and trying
      vainly to support them by grubbing in dusty parish registers. It is most
      necessary to defend you from your friends&mdash;from such friends as the
      veteran and inveterate M. Arséne Houssaye, or the industrious but
      puzzle-headed M. Loiseleur. Truly they seek the living among the dead, and
      the immortal Moliére among the sweepings of attorneys' offices. As I
      regard them (for I have tarried in their tents) and as I behold their
      trivialities&mdash;the exercises of men who neglect Moliérés works to
      write about Moliére's great-grandmother's second-best bed&mdash;I
      sometimes wish that Moliére were here to write on his devotees a new
      comedy, 'Les Moliéristes.' How fortunate were they, Monsieur, who lived
      and worked with you, who saw you day by day, who were attached, as
      Lagrange tells us, by the kindest loyalty to the best and most honourable
      of men, the most open-handed in friendship, in charity the most delicate,
      of the heartiest sympathy! Ah, that for one day I could behold you,
      writing in the study, rehearsing on the stage, musing in the lace-seller's
      shop, strolling through the Palais, turning over the new books at
      Billaine's, dusting your ruffles among the old volumes on the sunny
      stalls. Would that, through the ages, we could hear you after supper,
      merry with Boileau, and with Racine,&mdash;not yet a traitor,&mdash;laughing
      over Chapelain, combining to gird at him in an epigram, or mocking at
      Cotin, or talking your favourite philosophy, mindful of Descartes. Surely
      of all the wits none was ever so good a man, none ever made life so rich
      with humour and friendship.

      XIX. To Robert Burns.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;Among men of Genius, and especially among Poets, there are some
      to whom we turn with a peculiar and unfeigned affection; there are others
      whom we admire rather than love. By some we are won with our will, by
      others conquered against our desire. It has been your peculiar fortune to
      capture the hearts of a whole people&mdash;a people not usually prone to
      praise, but devoted with a personal and patriotic loyalty to you and to
      your reputation. In you every Scot who <i>is</i> a Scot sees, admires, and
      compliments Himself, his ideal self&mdash;independent, fond of whisky,
      fonder of the lassies; you are the true representative of him and of his
      nation. Next year will be the hundredth since the press of Kilmarnock
      brought to light its solitary masterpiece, your Poems; and next year,
      therefore, methinks, the revenue will receive a welcome accession from the
      abundance of whisky drunk in your honour. It is a cruel thing for any of
      your countrymen to feel that, where all the rest love, he can only admire;
      where all the rest are idolators, he may not bend the knee; but stands
      apart and beats upon his breast, observing, not adoring&mdash;a critic.
      Yet to some of us&mdash;petty souls, perhaps, and envious&mdash;that loud
      indiscriminating praise of 'Robbie Burns' (for so they style you in their
      Change-house familiarity) has long been ungrateful; and, among the
      treasures of your songs, we venture to select and even to reject. So it
      must be! We cannot all love Haggis, nor 'painch, tripe, and thairm,' and
      all those rural dainties which you celebrate as 'warm-reekin, rich!'
      'Rather too rich,' as the Young Lady said on an occasion recorded by Sam
      Weller.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware
     That jaups in luggies;
  But, if ye wish her gratefu' prayer,
     Gie her a Haggis!

 You <i>have</i> given her a Haggis, with a vengeance, and her 'gratefu' prayer' is
yours for ever. But if even an eternity of partridge may pall on the
epicure, so of Haggis too, as of all earthly delights, cometh satiety at
last. And yet what a glorious Haggis it is&mdash;the more emphatically rustic
and even Fescennine part of your verse! We have had many a rural bard
since Theocritus 'watched the visionary flocks,' but you are the only
one of them all who has spoken the sincere Doric. Yours is the talk of
the byre and the plough-tail; yours is that large utterance of the early
hinds. Even Theocritus minces matters, save where Lacon and Comatas
quite outdo the swains of Ayrshire. 'But thee, Theocritus, wha matches?'
you ask, and yourself out-match him in this wide rude region, trodden
only by the rural Muse.
</pre>
    <p>
      '<i>Thy</i> rural loves are nature's sel';' and the wooer of Jean Armour
      speaks more like a true shepherd than the elegant Daphnis of the
      'Oaristys.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed it is with this that moral critics of your life reproach you,
      forgetting, perhaps, that in your amours you were but as other Scotch
      ploughmen and shepherds of the past and present. Ettrick may still, with
      Afghanistan, offer matter for idylls, as Mr. Carlyle (your antithesis, and
      the complement of the Scotch character) supposed; but the morals of
      Ettrick are those of rural Sicily in old days, or of Mossgiel in your
      days. Over these matters the Kirk, with all her power, and the Free Kirk
      too, have had absolutely no influence whatever. To leave so delicate a
      topic, you were but as other swains, or, as 'that Birkie ca'd a lord,'
      Lord Byron; only you combined (in certain of your letters) a libertine
      theory with your practice; you poured out in song your audacious raptures,
      your half-hearted repentance, your shame and your scorn. You spoke the
      truth about rural lives and loves. We may like it or dislike it; but we
      cannot deny the verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it not as unhappy a thing, Sir, for you, as it was fortunate for
      Letters and for Scotland, that you were born at the meeting of two ages
      and of two worlds&mdash;precisely in the moment when bookish literature
      was beginning to reach the people, and when Society was first learning to
      admit the low-born to her Minor Mysteries? Before you how many singers not
      less truly poets than yourself&mdash;though less versatile not less
      passionate, though less sensuous not less simple&mdash;had been born and
      had died in poor men's cottages! There abides not even the shadow of a
      name of the old Scotch song-smiths, of the old ballad-makers. The authors
      of 'Clerk Saunders,' of 'The Wife of Usher's Well,' of 'Fair Annie,' and
      'Sir Patrick Spens,' and 'The Bonny Hind,' are as unknown to us as Homer,
      whom in their directness and force they resemble. They never, perhaps,
      gave their poems to writing; certainly they never gave them to the press.
      On the lips and in the hearts of the people they have their lives; and the
      singers, after a life obscure and untroubled by society or by fame, are
      forgotten. 'The Iniquity of Oblivion blindly scattereth his Poppy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Had you been born some years earlier you would have been even as these
      unnamed Immortals, leaving great verses to a little clan&mdash;verses
      retained only by Memory. You would have been but the minstrel of your
      native valley: the wider world would not have known you, nor you the
      world. Great thoughts of independence and revolt would never have burned
      in you; indignation would not have vexed you. Society would not have given
      and denied her caresses. You would have been happy. Your songs would have
      lingered in all 'the circle of the summer hills;' and your scorn, your
      satire, your narrative verse, would have been unwritten or unknown. To the
      world what a loss! and what a gain to you! We should have possessed but a
      few of your lyrics, as
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  When o'er the hill the eastern star
  Tells bughtin-time is near, my jo;
  And owsen frae the furrowed field,
  Return sae dowf and wearie O!
</pre>
    <p>
      How noble that is, how natural, how unconsciously Greek! You found, oddly,
      in good Mrs. Barbauld, the merits of the Tenth Muse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  In thy sweet sang, Barbauld, survives
  Even Sappho's flame!
</pre>
    <p>
      But how unconsciously you remind us both of Sappho and of Homer in these
      strains about the Evening Star and the hour when the Day <i>metenisseto
      boulytoide</i>?* Had you lived and died the pastoral poet of some silent
      glen, such lyrics could not but have survived; free, too, of all that in
      your songs reminds us of the Poet's Corner in the 'Kirkcudbright
      Advertiser.' We should not have read how
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Phoebus, gilding the brow o' morning,
    Banishes ilk darksome shade!

    <p>
      Still we might keep a love-poem unexcelled by Catullus,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Had we never loved sae kindly,
  Had we never loved sae blindly,
  Never met&mdash;or never parted,
  We had ne'er been broken-hearted.

    <p>
      But the letters to Clarinda would have been unwritten, and the thrush
      would have been untaught in 'the style of the Bird of Paradise.'

</pre>
    <p>
      A quiet life of song, <i>fallentis semita vitae</i>', was not to be yours.
      Fate otherwise decreed it. The touch of a lettered society, the strife
      with the Kirk, discontent with the State, poverty and pride, neglect and
      success, were needed to make your Genius what it was, and to endow the
      world with 'Tam o' Shanter,' the 'Jolly Beggars,' and 'Holy Willie's
      Prayer.' Who can praise them too highly&mdash;who admire in them too much
      the humour, the scorn, the wisdom, the unsurpassed energy and courage? So
      powerful, so commanding, is the movement of that Beggars' Chorus, that,
      methinks, it unconsciously echoed in the brain of our greatest living poet
      when he conceived the Vision of Sin. You shall judge for yourself. Recall:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Here's to budgets, bags, and wallets!
   Here's to all the wandering train!
   Here's our ragged bairns and callers!
   One and all cry out, Amen!

   A fig for those by law protected!
   Liberty's a glorious feast!
   Courts for cowards were erected!
   Churches built to please the priest!
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Then read this:   Drink to lofty hopes that cool
    Visions of a perfect state:
   Drink we, last, the public fool,
    Frantic love and frantic hate.
.........   Drink to Fortune, drink to Chance,
    While we keep a little breath!
   Drink to heavy Ignorance
    Hob and nob with brother Death!
Is not the movement the same, though the modern speaks a wilder
recklessness?
</pre>
    <p>
      So in the best company we leave you, who were the life and soul of so much
      company, good and bad. No poet, since the Psalmist of Israel, ever gave
      the world more assurance of a man; none lived a life more strenuous,
      engaged in an eternal conflict of the passions, and by them overcome&mdash;'mighty
      and mightily fallen.' When we think of you, Byron seems, as Plato would
      have said, remote by one degree from actual truth, and Musset by a degree
      more remote than Byron.

    <h2>
      XX. To Lord Byron.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
My Lord,  (Do you remember how Leigh Hunt
 Enraged you once by writing <i>My dear Byron</i>?)
  Books have their fates,&mdash;as mortals have who punt,
 And <i>yours</i> have entered on an age of iron.
  Critics there be who think your satin blunt,
 Your pathos, fudge; such perils must environ
 Poets who in their time were quite the rage,
 Though now there's not a soul to turn their page.

 Yes, there is much dispute about your worth,
  And much is said which you might like to know
 By modern poets here upon the earth,
  Where poets live, and love each other so;
 And, in Elysium, it may move your mirth
  To hear of bards that pitch your praises low,
 Though there be some that for your credit stickle,
 As&mdash;Glorious Mat,&mdash;and not inglorious Nichol.

 This kind of writing is my pet aversion,
  I hate the slang, I hate the personalities,
 I loathe the aimless, reckless, loose dispersion,
  Of every rhyme that in the singer's wallet is,
 I hate it as you hated the <i>Excursion</i>,
 But, while no man a hero to his valet is,
 The hero's still the model; I indite
 The kind of rhymes that Byron oft would write.

 There's a Swiss critic whom I cannot rhyme to,
  One Scherer, dry as sawdust, grim and prim.
 Of him there's much to say, if I had time to
  Concern myself in any wise with him.
 He seems to hate the heights he cannot climb to,
 He thinks your poetry a coxcomb's whim,
 A good deal of his sawdust he has spilt on
 Shakspeare, and Moliére, and you, and Milton.

 Ay, much his temper is like Vivien's mood,
  Which found not Galahad pure, nor Lancelot brave;
 Cold as a hailstorm on an April wood,
  He buries poets in an icy grave,
 His Essays&mdash;he of the Genevan hood!
  Nothing so good, but better doth he crave.
 So stupid and so solemn in his spite
 He dares to print that Moliére could not write!

 Enough of these excursions; I was saying
  That half our English Bards are turned Reviewers,
 And Arnold was discussing and assaying
  The weight and value of that work of yours,
 Examining and testing it and weighing,
  And proved, the gems are pure, the gold endures.
 While Swinburne cries with an exceeding joy,
 the stones are paste, and half the gold, alloy.

 In Byron, Arnold finds the greatest force,
  Poetic, in this later age of ours
 His song, a torrent from a mountain source,
  Clear as the crystal, singing with the showers,
 Sweeps to the sea in unrestricted course
  Through banks o'erhung with rocks and sweet with flowers;
 None of your brooks that modestly meander,
 But swift as Awe along the Pass of Brander.

 And when our century has clomb its crest,
  And backward gazes o'er the plains of Time,
 And counts its harvest, yours is still the best,
  The richest garner in the field of rhyme
 (The metaphoric mixture, 't is confest,
  Is all my own, and is not quite sublime).
 But fame's not yours alone; you must divide all
 The plums and pudding with the Bard of Rydal!

 WORDSWORTH and BYRON, these the lordly names
  And these the gods to whom most incense burns.
 'Absurd!' cries Swinburne, and in anger flames,
  And in an AEschylean fury spurns
 With impious foot your altar, and exclaims
  And wreathes his laurels on the golden urns
 Where Coleridge's and Shelley's ashes lie,
 Deaf to the din and heedless of the cry.

 For Byron (Swinburne shouts) has never woven
  One honest thread of life within his song;
 As Offenbach is to divine Beethoven
  So Byron is to Shelley (<i>This</i> is strong!),
 And on Parnassus' peak, divinely cloven,
  He may not stand, or stands by cruel wrong;
 For Byron's rank (the Examiner has reckoned)
 Is in the third class or a feeble second.

 'A Bernesque poet' at the very most,
  And never earnest save in politics&mdash;
 The Pegasus that he was wont to boast
  A blundering, floundering hackney, full of tricks,
 A beast that must be driven to the post
  By whips and spurs and oaths and kicks and sticks,
 A gasping, ranting, broken-winded brute,
 That any judge of Pegasi would shoot;

 In sooth, a half-bred Pegasus, and far gone
  In spavin, curb, and half a hundred woes.
 And Byron's style is 'jolter-headed jargon;'
  His verse is 'only bearable in prose.'
 So living poets write of those that are gone,
  And o'er the Eagle thus the Bantam crows;
 And Swinburne ends where Verisopht began,
 By owning you 'a very clever man.'

 Or rather does not end: he still must utter
  A quantity of the unkindest things.
 Ah! were you here, I marvel, would you flutter
  O'er such a foe the tempest of your wings?
 'T is 'rant and cant and glare and splash and splutter'
  That rend the modest air when Byron sings.
 There Swinburne stops: a critic rather fiery.
 <i>Animis caelestibus tantaene irae</i>?

 But whether he or Arnold in the right is,
  Long is the argument, the quarrel long;
 <i>Non nobis est  to settle  tantas lites</i>;
  No poet I, to judge of right or wrong:
 But of all things I always think a fight is
  The most unpleasant in the lists of song;
 When Marsyas of old was flayed, Apollo
 Set an example which we need not follow.

 The fashion changes! Maidens do not wear,
  As once they wore, in necklaces and lockets
 A curl ambrosial of Lord Byron's hair;
  'Don Juan' is not always in our pockets
 Nay, a NEW WRITER's readers do not care
  Much for your verse, but are inclined to mock its
 Manners and morals. Ay, and most young ladies
 To yours prefer the 'Epic' called 'of Hades'!

 I do not blame them; I'm inclined to think
  That with the reigning taste 't is vain to quarrel,
 And Burns might teach his votaries to drink,
  And Byron never meant to make them moral.
 You yet have lovers true, who will not shrink
  From lauding you and giving you the laurel;
 The Germans too, those men of blood and iron,
 Of all our poets chiefly swear by Byron.

 Farewell, thou Titan fairer than the gods!
  Farewell, farewell, thou swift and lovely spirit,
 Thou splendid warrior with the world at odds,
  Unpraised, unpraisable, beyond thy merit;
 Chased, like Oresres, by the furies' rods,
  Like him at length thy peace dost thou inherit;
 Beholding whom, men think how fairer far
 Than all the steadfast stars the wandering star!

      XXI. To Omar Kha'yya'm.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Wise Omar, do the Southern Breezes fling
  Above your Grave, at ending of the Spring,
    The Snowdrift of the petals of the Rose,
  The wild white Roses you were wont to sing?

  Far in the South I know a Land divine, (1)
  And there is many a Saint and many a Shrine,
   And over all the shrines the Blossom blows
  Of Roses that were dear to you as wine.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) The hills above San Remo, where rose-bushes are planted
     by the shrines. Omar desired that his grave might be where
     the wind would scatter rose-leaves over it.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  You were a Saint of unbelieving days,
  Liking your Life and happy in men's Praise;
   Enough for you the Shade beneath the Bough,
  Enough to watch the wild World go its Ways.

  Dreadless and hopeless thou of Heaven or Hell,
  Careless of Words thou hadst not Skill to spell,
   Content to know not all thou knowest now,
  What's Death? Doth any Pitcher dread the Well?

  The Pitchers we, whose Maker makes them ill,
  Shall He torment them if they chance to spill?
   Nay, like the broken potsherds are we cast
  Forth and forgotten,&mdash;and what will be will!

  So still were we, before the Months began
  That rounded us and shaped us into Man.
   So still we shall be, surely, at the last,
  Dreamless, untouched of Blessing or of Ban!

  Ah, strange it seems that this thy common thought
  How all things have been, ay, and shall be nought
   Was ancient Wisdom in thine ancient East,
  In those old Days when Senlac fight was fought,

  Which gave our England for a captive Land
  To pious Chiefs of a believing Band,
   A gift to the Believer from the Priest,
  Tossed from the holy to the blood-red Hand! (1)

  (1) Omar was contemporary with the battle of Hastings.

  Yea, thou wert singing when that Arrow clave
  Through helm and brain of him who could not save
   His England, even of Harold Godwin's son;
  The high tide murmurs by the Hero's grave! (1)

  (1) Per mandata Ducis, Rex hic, Heralde, quiescis,
       Ut custos maneas littoris et pelagi.

  And <i>thou</i> wert wreathing Roses&mdash;who can tell?&mdash;
  Or chanting for some girl that pleased thee well,
   Or satst at wine in Nasha'pu'r, when dun
  The twilight veiled the field where Harold fell!

  The salt Sea-waves above him rage and roam!
  Along the white Walls of his guarded Home
   No Zephyr stirs the Rose, but o'er the wave
  The wild Wind beats the Breakers into Foam!

  And dear to him, as Roses were to thee,
  Rings long the Roar of Onset of the Sea;
   The <i>Swan's Path</i> of his Fathers is his grave:
  His sleep, methinks, is sound as thine can be.

  His was the Age of Faith, when all the West
  Looked to the Priest for torment or for rest;
   And thou wert living then, and didst not heed
  The Saint who banned thee or the Saint who blessed!

  Ages of Progress! These eight hundred years
  Hath Europe shuddered with her hopes or fears,
   And now!&mdash;she listens in the wilderness
  To thee, and half believeth what she hears!

  Hadst <i>thou</i> THE SECRET? Ah, and who may tell?
  'An hour we have,' thou saidst. 'Ah, waste it well!'
   An hour we have, and yet Eternity
  Looms o'er us, and the thought of Heaven or Hell!

  Nay, we can never be as wise as thou,
  O idle singer 'neath the blossomed bough.
   Nay, and we cannot be content to die.
  <i>We</i> cannot shirk the questions 'Where?' and 'How?'

  Ah, not from learned Peace and gay Content
   Shall we of England go the way he went
   The Singer of the Red Wine and the Rose
  Nay, otherwise than his our Day is spent!

  Serene he dwelt in fragrant Nasha'pu'r,
  But we must wander while the Stars endure.
   <i>He</i> knew THE SECRET: we have none that knows,
  No Man so sure as Omar once was sure!

      XXII. To Q. Horatius Flaccus.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In what manner of Paradise are we to conceive that you, Horace, are
      dwelling, or what region of immortality can give you such pleasures as
      this life afforded? The country and the town, nature and men, who knew
      them so well as you, or who ever so wisely made the best of those two
      worlds? Truly here you had good things, nor do you ever, in all your
      poems, look for more delight in the life beyond; you never expect
      consolation for present sorrow, and when you once have shaken hands with a
      friend the parting seems to you eternal.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus
  Tam cari capitis?
</pre>
    <p>
      So you sing, for the dear head you mourn has sunk for ever beneath the
      wave. Virgil might wander forth bearing the golden branch 'the Sibyl doth
      to singing men allow,' and might visit, as one not wholly without hope,
      the dim dwellings of the dead and the unborn. To him was it permitted to
      see and sing 'mothers and men, and the bodies outworn of mighty heroes,
      boys and unwedded maids, and young men borne to the funeral fire before
      their parents' eyes.' The endless caravan swept past him&mdash;'many as
      fluttering leaves that drop and fall in autumn woods when the first frost
      begins; many as birds that flock landward from the great sea when now the
      chill year drives them o'er the deep and leads them to sunnier lands.'
      Such things was it given to the sacred poet to behold, and the happy seats
      and sweet pleasances of fortunate souls, where the larger light clothes
      all the plains and dips them in a rosier gleam, plains with their own new
      sun and stars before unknown. Ah, not <i>frustra pius</i> was Virgil, as
      you say, Horace, in your melancholy song. In him, we fancy, there was a
      happier mood than your melancholy patience. 'Not, though thou wert sweeter
      of song than Thracian Orpheus, with that lyre whose lay led the dancing
      trees, not so would the blood return to the empty shade of him whom once
      with dread wand the inexorable god hath folded with his shadowy flocks;
      but patience lighteneth what heaven forbids us to undo.'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    <i>Durum, sed levius fit patientia</i>?
</pre>
    <p>
      It was all your philosophy in that last sad resort to which we are pushed
      so often&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'With close-lipped Patience for our only friend,
  Sad Patience, too near neighbour of Despair.'
</pre>
    <p>
      The Epicurean is at one with the Stoic at last, and Horace with Marcus
      Aurelius. 'To go away from among men, if there are gods, is not a thing to
      be afraid of; but if indeed they do not exist, or if they have no concern
      about human affairs, what is it to me to live in a universe devoid of gods
      or devoid of providence?'
    </p>
    <p>
      An excellent philosophy, but easier to those for whom no Hope had dawn or
      seemed to set. Yet it is harder than common, Horace, for us to think of
      you, still glad somewhere, among rivers like Liris and plains and
      vine-clad hills, that
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Solemque suum, sua sidera borunt.

    <p>
      It is hard, for you looked for no such thing.

      Enough, Horace, of these mortuary musings. You loved the lesson of the
      roses, and now and again would speak somewhat like a death's head over thy
      temperate cups of Sabine <i>ordinaire</i>. Your melancholy moral was but
      meant to heighten the joy of thy pleasant life, when wearied Italy, after
      all her wars and civic bloodshed, had won a peaceful haven. The harbour
      might be treacherous; the prince might turn to the tyrant; far away on the
      wide Roman marches might be heard, as it were, the endless, ceaseless
      monotone of beating horses' hoofs and marching feet of men. They were
      coming, they were nearing, like footsteps heard on wool; there was a sound
      of multitudes and millions of barbarians, all the North, <i>officina
      gentium</i>, mustering and marshalling her peoples. But their coming was
      not to be to-day, nor to-morrow; nor to-day was the budding princely sway
      to blossom into the blood-red flower of Nero. In the hall between the two
      tempests of Republic and Empire your odes sound 'like linnets in the
      pauses of the wind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      What joy there is in these songs! what delight of life, what an exquisite
      Hellenic grace of art, what a manly nature to endure, what tenderness and
      constancy of friendship, what a sense of all that is fair in the
      glittering stream, the music of the waterfall, the hum of bees, the
      silvery grey of the olive woods on the hillside! How human are all your
      verses, Horace! what a pleasure is yours in the straining poplars, swaying
      in the wind! what gladness you gain from the white crest of Soracte,
      beheld through the fluttering snowflakes while the logs are being piled
      higher on the hearth. You sing of women and wine&mdash;not all
      whole-hearted in your praise of them, perhaps, for passion frightens you,
      and 't is pleasure more than love that you commend to the young. Lydia and
      Glycera, and the others, are but passing guests of a heart at ease in
      itself, and happy enough when their facile reign is ended. You seem to me
      like a man who welcomes middle age, and is more glad than Sophocles was to
      'flee from these hard masters' the passions. In the 'fallow leisure of
      life' you glance round contented, and find all very good save the need to
      leave all behind. Even that you take with an Italian good-humour, as the
      folk of your sunny country bear poverty and hunger.

    <i>Durum, sed levius fit patientia</i>!

    <p>
      To them, to you, the loveliness of your land is, and was, a thing to live
      for. None of the Latin poets your fellows, or none but Virgil, seem to me
      to have known so well as you, Horace, how happy and fortunate a thing it
      was to be born in Italy. You do not say so, like your Virgil, in one
      splendid passage, numbering the glories of the land as a lover might count
      the perfections of his mistress. But the sentiment is ever in your heart
      and often on your lips.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Me nec tam patiens Lacedaemon,
  Nec tam Larissae percussit campus opimae,
   Quam domus Albuneae resonantis
  Et praeceps Anio, ac Tiburni lucus, et uda
   Mobilibus pomaria rivis. (1)

     (1) 'Me neither resolute Sparta nor the rich Larissaean
     plain so enraptures as the fane of echoing Albunea, the
     headlong Anio, the grove of Tibur, the orchards watered by
     the wandering rills.
</pre>
    <p>
      So a poet should speak, and to every singer his own land should be
      dearest. Beautiful is Italy with the grave and delicate outlines of her
      sacred hills, her dark groves, her little cities perched like eyries on
      the crags, her rivers gliding under ancient walls; beautiful is Italy, her
      seas, and her suns: but dearer to me the long grey wave that bites the
      rock below the minster in the north; dearer is the barren moor and black
      peat-water swirling in tanny foam, and the scent of bog myrtle and the
      bloom of heather, and, watching over the lochs, the green round-shouldered
      hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      In affection for your native land, Horace, certainly the pride in great
      Romans dead and gone made part, and you were, in all senses, a lover of
      your country, your country's heroes, your country's gods. None but a
      patriot could have sung that ode on Regulus, who died, as our own hero
      died, on an evil day for the honour of Rome, as Gordon for the honour of
      England.

 Donec labantes consilio patres

  Interque maerentes amicos
   Egregius properaret exul.

 Atqui sciebat, quae sibi barbarus
 Tortor pararet: non aliter tamen
  Dimovit obstantes propinquos,

      (1) 'They say he put aside from him the pure lips of his wife and his
      little children, like a man unfree, and with his brave face bowed
      earthward sternly he waited till with such counsel as never mortal gave he
      might strengthen the hearts of the Fathers, and through his mourning
      friends go forth, a hero, into exile. Yet well he knew what things were
      being prepared for him at the hands of the tormenters, who, none the less,
      put aside the kinsmen that barred his path and the people that would fain
      have held him back, passing through their midst as he might have done, if,
      his retainers' weary business ended and the suits adjudged, he were faring
      to his Venafran lands or to Dorian Tarentum.'
    </p>
    <p>
      We talk of the Greeks as your teachers. Your teachers they were, but that
      poem could only have been written by a Roman! The strength, the
      tenderness, the noble and monumental resolution and resignation&mdash;these
      are the gift of the lords of human things, the masters of the world. Your
      country's heroes are dear to you, Horace, but you did not sing them better
      than your country's Gods, the pious protecting spirits of the hearth, the
      farm, the field, kindly ghosts, it may be, of Latin fathers dead or Gods
      framed in the image of these. What you actually believed we know not, <i>you</i>
      knew not. Who knows what he believes? <i>Parcus Deorum cultor</i> you
      bowed not often, it may be, in the temples of the state religion and
      before the statues of the great Olympians; but the pure and pious worship
      of rustic tradition, the faith handed down by the homely elders, with that
      you never broke. Clean hands and a pure heart, these, with a sacred cake
      and shining grains of salt, you could offer to the Lares. It was a
      benignant religion, uniting old times and new, men living and men long
      dead and gone, in a kind of service and sacrifice solemn yet familiar.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
