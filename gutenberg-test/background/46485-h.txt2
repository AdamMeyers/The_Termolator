Preface


Washed by the blue Mediterranean and
kissed by the warm southern sun, the Iberian
Peninsula lies at the southwestern corner of
Europe. To this sunny land of Spain we owe
much, for, from its hospitable shores, aided
by her generous queen, Columbus sailed to
discover that New World which is to-day our
home. We should therefore be very friendly
to the country which helped him, and American
boys and girls should welcome the coming
of Our Little Spanish Cousin.

Our Little Spanish Cousin



CHAPTER I.

THE CHRISTENING


One of the first things which Fernando
remembered was the christening of his little
sister. He was five years old and had no
other brother or sister to play with, for Pablo,
his wonderful big brother, was away at the
Naval School, and his older sister, Augustia,
was at school in the convent.

When Fernando's nurse told him that he
had a little sister he was delighted, and begged
to see her; and when all his relatives on both
sides of the house came to see the baby
christened, he was still more pleased.

[2]

Fernando was a little Spanish boy, and in
his country a great deal is thought of kinsfolk,
for the Spanish are very warm-hearted and
affectionate. So Fernando was glad to see all
his aunts and uncles and cousins and all the
friends who happened to be visiting them
at the time.

Fernando's father, the Señor Don Juan de
Guzman, was a courtly gentleman, and he
bowed low over the ladies' hands, and said,
"The house is yours, señora!" to each one;
so, as boys generally copy their fathers, Fernando
assured his little cousins that he "placed
himself at their feet," and welcomed them just
as politely as his father had the older folk.

What a wonderful time he had that day!
First came the christening in the great Cathedral
which towers above Granada, and in
which lie buried the king and queen, Ferdinand
and Isabella, in whose reign Columbus
sailed away from Spain to discover America.[3]
The Cathedral was so grand that it always
made Fernando feel very strange and quiet,
and he thought it was shocking that the baby
cried when the priest poured water on her
and baptized her, Maria Dolores Concepcion
Isabel Inez Juanita. This seems a long name
for such a tiny little mite, but there was a
reason for every single name, and not one
could be left out. Nearly all Spanish children
are named Maria, whether boys or girls, because
the Spaniards are devoted to the Virgin
Mary, and as the baby was born on the Feast
of the Immaculate Conception, she was called
Concepcion. Isabel was for her aunt, and
Inez was for her godmother, and Juanita
for her father. Her name did not seem at
all long to Fernando, for his name was Fernando
Antonio Maria Allegria Francisco Ruy
Guzman y Ximenez. Every one called him
Fernando or Nando, and his long name had
troubled him but once in all his gay little life.[4]
That time he had been naughty and had
run away from his aya, the nurse who always
watches little Spanish children like a faithful
dog, and he had fallen into the deep ditch
beside the great aloe hedge.

The aloes are stalwart plants with long
leaves, wide-extending and saw-toothed, and
they are often planted close together so as
to make hedgerows through which cattle cannot
pass. The leaves of the aloe are sometimes
a yard long, and they are very useful. From
them are made strong cords, and also the
alpagatas, or sandals, which the peasants wear;
and the fibres of the leaf are separated from
the pulp and made into many things to wear.
The central stem of the aloe grows sometimes
twenty feet high, and it has a number of stems
on the ends of which grow yellow flowers.
The leaves are a bluish-green in colour, and
look like long blue swords. The long hedgerows
look very beautiful against the soft blue[5]
of the Spanish sky, but little Fernando did not
see anything pretty in them as he lay at the
bottom of the ditch, roaring lustily.

"Who's there?" demanded an American
gentleman, who was travelling in Spain, as he
came along on the other side of the hedge,
and Fernando replied, "Fernando Antonio
Maria Allegria Francisco Ruy Guzman y
Ximenez!"

"If there's so many of you I should think
you could help each other out," said the
American, and when he finally extricated one
small boy he laughed heartily, and said, as
he took Fernando home:

"I should think a name like that would
topple you over." After that Fernando always
called Americans "the people who laugh."

After the baby was christened, they went
home through the narrow streets of the quaint
old town. All the horses wore bells, and, as
they trotted along, the tinkle, tinkle sounded[6]
like sleighing-time in America. The reason
for this is that in many places the streets are
too narrow for two carriages to pass, and the
bells give warning that a vehicle is coming,
so that the one coming from the opposite
direction may find a wide spot in the road,
and there wait till the other carriage has
passed.



"THE OWNER PULLED IT UP TO HER WINDOW AGAIN."


As the christening party went toward the
home of Fernando, it passed a man driving
two or three goats, and he stopped in front of
a house, from a window of which was let down
a string and a pail. Into this the man looked,
and taking out a piece of money which lay
in the bottom, he milked the pail full from one
of the goats, and the owner pulled it up to her
window again. It seems a strange way to get
your morning's milk, but it is sure to be fresh
and sweet, right from the goat, and there is
no chance to put water in it, as milkmen
sometimes do in America.

[7]

The houses Fernando passed were all painted
in many soft colours, and they had charming
little iron balconies, to some of which palm
branches were fastened, blessed palms from
the church at Holy Week, which the Spaniards
believe will keep lightning from striking
the house.

Fernando's house was much larger than the
rest, for his father was a noble of one of the
oldest families in Spain, whose ancestors had
done many splendid things for the state in
the olden times. The house had several
balconies, from which hung down long sprays
of blossoms, for every balcony railing was
filled with flower-pots. There grew vines
and flowers, nasturtiums, hyacinths, wallflowers,
pinks and violets, their sweet scents filling
the air.

When the christening party entered the
house, the baby was borne off to the nursery,
and Fernando, no longer a baby, but a big[8]
boy with a baby sister, was allowed to go with
the rest to the patio, where breakfast was
served.

The patio is one of the most charming things
about the real Spanish houses. It is a court
in the centre of the house, larger than an ordinary
room, with a marble floor and a huge
awning which protects from the sun, yet leaves
the patio open to the fresh air and sweet scents
of the sunny out-of-doors. All the family
gather in the patio, and it is the favourite
lounging-place for old and young. In the
patio of the Señor Guzman's house were orange-trees
and jasmine, and all colours of violets
bloomed around the marble rim of the fountain,
which was in the centre.

What a wonderful thing that christening
feast was to Fernando! There was much laughing
and talking, and such good things to eat!

When all were through eating, little Juanita's
health was drunk, and her godfather proposed[9]
her health, and recited a poem he had
composed in her honour.


  
    
"Queridita Ahijada!
Plague alecielo qui tu vida
Sea feliz y placentera
Cual arroyo cristalino
Qui atra viesa la pradera
Su Padrino, Francesco."[1]



This very much delighted every one, and so
with laughter and merriment the christening
feast was over.




[10]



CHAPTER II.

SCHOOL-DAYS


When Fernando was seven years old he
began to go to school. Little Juanita cried
bitterly, for she was devoted to the big brother
who played such lovely games with her, and
she did not like to think of his being away
from her nearly all day. However, she was
told that Fernando was a big boy now, and
that before long she would be having a governess
to teach her to read and embroider,
so she stopped crying very quickly, for she
was a sunny little child, and went to picking
flowers in the garden quite contentedly.

How grown up Fernando felt! To be a
real schoolboy! His school-days were all
alike. He arose at half-past seven, when the[11]
church-bells were ringing for the daily service;
he had a bath, said his prayers, and dressed
himself very neatly, for he had first to be
looked over by his aya, and then inspected by
his mamma, to see if he could pass muster,
and was clean and neat as a little Spanish
gentleman should be. Mamma being satisfied
with his appearance, he gave her his morning
kiss, and greeted the rest of the family. Then
followed breakfast,&mdash;a simple, wholesome meal
of semula, or gruel and warm milk, with bread
and honey and eggs.

After a run in the garden, the ayo, or preceptor,
called to take him to school. Fernando
skipped happily away to study until
twelve o'clock, when dinner was served to the
day boarders, a dinner of soup, vegetables,
and dessert, with a little playtime afterward.
Spanish boys do not take tea or coffee until
they are grown up. At half-past four the
boys are turned out of school, and then comes[12]
the delight of the day to Fernando. His ayo
has disappeared, and in his stead has come
Manuel, his own man, who tells such delightful
stories of knights and warriors and the
glories of Spain, and who thinks that all his
little master does is perfect. Manuel knows
all about the city, and he is willing to take Fernando
any place he wishes to go, provided
it is a fit place for a boy of rank. He knows
just where the marionettes are playing, and
if there is a gay crowd on the square, a trained
bear or a funny little monkey, he will be sure
to have heard about it, and take Fernando
to see it. If there is no special excitement,
Manuel takes him to the paseo, where all the
boys of the town gather. Here they play
in mimic battles and bull-fights, and Fernando
enters into everything with delight, until Manuel
thinks it is time for the señora, his mother,
to pass by in the carriage. How delighted
the little boy is to see her, and how his tongue[13]
rattles as he tells her all the events of the day,
as he rides home with her through the long
soft twilight of the soft Spanish night! How
good his supper tastes, a simple little supper
of chocolate, rich and dark, white bread and
golden honey, with some little iced cakes,
which dear old Dolores, the cook, has made
for the little master. All the servants love
Fernando dearly, for though he has a hot
temper, and sometimes is very wilful, he is
so loving that they do not mind his naughtiness.
After supper Fernando says the rosary
with his aya, goes over his lessons a little,
and then tumbles into bed in a happy slumber.

All his days are very much alike, for Spanish
children are brought up very simply, and
have little excitement, though they have many
pleasures. There are little visits paid to aunts
and cousins, visits remembered not too pleasantly
by the pet dog and parrot of his aunt.[14]
The parrot was brought from Cuba by Uncle
Enrico, the priest. The bird knows Fernando
well, and scolds terribly in most unchurchly
language every time he approaches the cage.
The French poodle, too, does not greatly care
for a visit from Fernando, for the boy cannot
help teasing, and the fat, stupid dog, his Aunt
Isabel's darling, does nothing but lie around
on silken cushions and eat comfits. Fernando
likes animals, and would never really hurt one,
but there is something in the calm self-satisfaction
of Beppino which stirs up all the mischief
in him, and Aunt Isabel has been heard
to exclaim: "Fernando will be my death!
He is a dear boy, and if it came to choosing
between him and Beppo, I am quite sure that
I would take my nephew, but, thank Heaven,
I have not to choose!"

Fernando's own dog was different. He
found him one day close by the garden railing,
a poor, ragged fellow, lean and hungry, with a[15]
lame foot, but a pair of pleading and wistful
brown eyes, which, with all their misery, had
yet a look of good-fellowship within them
which appealed to Fernando's gay nature, as
the pitiful plight of the little fellow appealed
to his tender heart. The dog put a pink
tongue through the railing and licked Fernando's
hand, and that clinched the bargain.
Henceforth the two were friends. Fernando
persuaded Manuel to bathe and tie up the
wounded foot, and feed the puppy. That
was all the boy dared at first, but the next day
he found the dog in the same place and fed
him again. Every day after that the little
tramp followed him to school, and when school
was over his yellow-haired dogship awaited his
benefactor. Manuel winked at the friendship,
and allowed Mazo, as Fernando called him, to
have many a good meal at the garden gate.
Manuel was a great stickler for the proprieties,
but he had been a boy once, and there were[16]
some things that Fernando's lady mother would
not at all have comprehended, that good old
Manuel understood perfectly. Mazo was
far more interesting to Fernando than the
thoroughbred, ladylike pets of his mother, and
it was a sore subject with him that Mazo, who
was so clever, who could whip the tramp dogs
of any of his school friends, should be kept
outside the house. His mother did not seem
to realize that Mazo's fighting qualities were
what made him valuable. One fatal day, when
she had driven to the paseo a little earlier than
usual, and had seen a fight between Mazo and
another little dog, equally disreputable, she
had cried out:

"Fernando, come away from that ferocious
beast! He must be mad!" and she had
seemed anything but reassured when Fernando
had tried to calm her by saying:

"But, mamma, he is not mad; I know him
well; he is the gentlest of beings, and he can[17]
whip any dog in the paseo," the pride of possession
getting the better of prudence.

Thereafter Manuel was most careful of
Mazo's appearance. He captured him and
washed him, and let him sleep in a shed at
night, and by degrees the little fellow lost his
trampish appearance, and became a semi-respectable
member of society, though still ready
to follow Fernando like a shadow, to fight at
his will, and to share with him an excursion
into forbidden lands. It was really droll to
see the different airs which Mazo could assume.
He had ever an eye upon his audience, having
early learned in the hard school of misfortune
that his comfort depended not at all upon himself,
but upon the humour of those about him.
With the outside world his look was wary.
With the family of his master he was apologetic.
His brown eye seemed to say: "I
place myself at your feet, most noble señors;
I pray you excuse me for living." But with[18]
Fernando, while it was tempered with respect,
his air was one of good-fellowship alone.
Even the señora herself, the head of the house
and authority in chief, as is the case in all
Spanish households, came to regard Fernando's
dog with a degree of friendliness, and
finding this out, the servants treated him
kindly, and Mazo decided that his lines had
fallen in pleasant places. Upon this, however,
he never presumed. He knew not how long
it would last, but felt that he was upon good
behaviour. He restrained his desire to chase
Juanita's pet cat, and to bark when the parrot
imitated his barking, though the restraint put
upon himself must have been severe, for he
made up for it when out with Manuel and Fernando.
Then he was himself again, Mazo the
tramp.





[19]




CHAPTER III.

A VISIT TO A HACIENDA


One day in October, when the sun was
shining in golden beauty, the señora said to
her husband:

"I should like to go to the hacienda to-morrow,
and take the children with me, for la niña
has never seen the picking, and Fernando did
not go last year or the year before."

"It will give me pleasure to escort you,"
said the Señor de Guzman, in the courtly
manner which Spanish gentlemen use toward
their wives. "At what hour will it please you
to start?"

"As early as you can," she answered. "So
that we may arrive there in plenty of time to
see the picking before luncheon, and after a[20]
siesta, drive back in the pleasant part of the
afternoon."

"We shall start at nine, then," said her
husband, "and should arrive there by ten or
a little after."

When Fernando returned from school and
heard that he was to accompany his mother
next day, he was nearly beside himself with
joy.

"Juanita," he cried, "you have no idea how
delightful it is at the fruit farm! I have
not been there for two years, but I remember
it well. All the oranges one can eat, and
such raisins! You will much enjoy it, I am
sure."

He was up bright and early next day, and
impatient to start long before his mother was
ready, and even his father was waiting before
the señora made her appearance. She was a
large woman, and very slow and graceful in
her movements. No one had ever seen her[21]
hurried, and every one expected to wait for
her, so that it was nearly half-past nine when
they started. The coachman whipped up the
horses, and away they went skimming over
the rough stones. Fernando sat with Diego
and Manuel on the front seat of the carriage,
while Dolores sat beside the señora, holding
Juanita on her lap. The señor rode upon his
high-stepping Andalusian horse beside the
carriage, and pointed out places of interest to
the children as they drove along.

A gay young officer passed by them, young
and slim, riding a handsome horse, and some
soldiers were man&oelig;uvring on the Plaza. One
poor fellow, once a gay soldier, but now with
an empty sleeve, dressed in a faded army
blouse and wearing a merit medal, was begging
in the street, and the señor stopped to
give him a piece of silver, for Spaniards are
always generous and pitiful, and cannot resist
a beggar. "He had served in Cuba," said the[22]
señor to his wife, and she sighed as she thought
of the many lost to Spain and their dear ones
in that useless war.

Fruit-venders passed along the street, and
donkeys so laden with fruit and flowers that
almost nothing could be seen of them but
their slim little legs and their great waving
ears. Water-carriers were there, carrying huge
jars which looked like those used by the old
Moors; and a travelling merchant, in gray
garments, but with brightly dressed mules.
It was not so bright a party that they passed
later, for a peasant funeral passed by on its
way to the cemetery. Four young men carried
the bier, upon which was the body of
a child, covered all but its face, which lay
exposed to the sun.

"Take off your hat, son," said the señora.
"Always do so to a passing funeral, for maybe
yours will be the last salute the dead will
receive on earth."

[23]

No sooner was the funeral passed than there
came a straw and charcoal merchant, crying,
"Paja! Carbon! Cabrito!" So many people
in Granada have no way to warm themselves
except by the brazero, in which charcoal
is burnt, that there is great need for
the charcoal man, and he drives a brisk
trade.

Next they saw a priest on a sick call, for he
bore the Blessed Sacrament. A crowd of
ragged urchins stopped in their play to kneel
as he passed, and Fernando and his father
raised their hats.

By this time, the carriage had reached the
outskirts of the city, and the road wound
along the banks of the Darro, a rushing
stream which gushes out of a deep mountain
gorge, and passes through the town. Its
banks are lined with quaint old houses, leaning
far over the river, and Fernando saw
women there, washing their linen in the[24]
water, and spreading their clothes on the
stones to dry.

Outside of the town their way lay along
the beautiful Vega, which stretches beyond
Granada, in green and fertile loveliness, to the
far-away hills. Crossed by two rivers, the
Darro and Genil, the plain is dotted with
whitewashed villas, nestling like birds in the
soft green of the olive and orange trees.
Sloping gradually to the mountains above,
the Vega is green as emerald, and truly a
fair sight beneath the turquoise sky, and
the mother-of-pearl of the snowy mountains.

Fernando's father owned large estates upon
the hillsides, and raised oranges and grapes.
The last were used for raisins, the grapes from
which the finest wine is made, the Amontillado,
for which Spain is so famous, not
reaching their greatest perfection in this part
of the land.

[25]

In an hour they reached the farm and drove
down the long lane which led to the house.
The Hacienda of Santa Eulalia was a large, low
building, with a broad porch and a tangle
of vines and roses climbing over it. Huge
trees spread their arms over the roof, and from
the balcony one could see groves of cypress-trees,
pines, oaks, and poplars, beyond the
fruit-trees, and, above all, the rose-coloured
peaks of the Sierras. Upon the slope of the
hill, as it fell away toward Granada, were the
grape-vines, with huge clusters of grapes, purple,
white, and red, weighing down the vines.
There were, too, terraces where the raisins
dried; and nearer the house were the drying-sheds,
where an army of packers pressed
the raisins under boards, and carefully sorted
them before packing. The vineyards were
beautiful, but even more so were the orange
groves, and one who has seen a grove in full
fruit never forgets the beautiful sight. The[26]
trees are deep green in colour, and full of
leaves, many of them bearing at the same
time flowers and green and ripe fruit.

The children were wild with delight, and
ran about eager to see the picking and sorting
of the fine fruit, for the oranges of Santa
Eulalia were famous for size and quality.
The trees grew rather low to the ground,
and were covered with fruit which the pickers
were gathering. Ladders were put up to the
lower branches, and each picker carried a
basket swung to his neck by a cord. He
carefully picked the oranges, one at a time,
and dropped them in his basket, and so expert
were many of them that it seemed as if they
had scarcely mounted the ladder before the
basket was full. Many young girls were employed
as pickers, and they were particularly
skilful, vying with the men in their swiftness.
Very gay were their voices, and merry jest
and song enlivened the work, until it seemed[27]
as if it were not work but play. Fernando
and Juanita hopped about like little rabbits,
eating the fruit which rolled to the ground,
for often the golden globes fell from the trees,
as they were shaken by the picking.

When the baskets were filled, the oranges
were carried to the sheds and left overnight to
harden the skins a little, when each orange
was wrapped in soft tissue-paper. For this
are employed young boys and girls, and very
expert they grow in the wrapping of the
oranges, each one being properly wrapped with
but a twist of the hand. The next thing is
the packing, and the oranges are stored away
in wooden boxes, and are ready to be shipped
to market.

The children ate so many oranges that they
scarcely wanted any of the luncheon prepared
for them at the hacienda. There was an omelet
with green peppers, a delicious salad,
some fowl, and tiny round potato balls, all[28]
sprinkled over with chopped parsley, with
a huge dish of oranges and grapes for
dessert.

The señora insisted upon a little siesta
after luncheon, but Fernando's eyes were so
wide open that he could not close them as
he swung to and fro in the great hammock
between two orange-trees in front of the house.
He was delighted when his father sat down
beside him, in one of the big easy chairs,
and said:

"You look to me like a boy who would like
to hear a story."

"Indeed I would; please tell me one,"
said Fernando.

"Have you ever heard about the judges
of Pedro the Cruel?"

"No, papa," said Fernando, all interest.

"A long time ago, there ruled over Andalusia
a king named Pedro, and he was so
disliked by his subjects, and did so many[29]
wicked things, that he was called Pedro the
Cruel. He lived in the city of Sevilla, and
though he was cruel, and often heartless, still
he had a strong sense of justice, which would
not allow the common people to be badly
treated. He found out one day that four
of his judges had been cheating the people
and taking bribes, and he determined to teach
them a lesson. He went to his favourite
gardens, those of the Alcazar, and sent for
the judges to come to him there. It is a
wonderful place even to-day, and then it must
have been very beautiful. Huge banana-trees
waved their rough green leaves above the
tangled beauty of the flower-beds, where jasmine
and violets and roses grew in profusion.
In the midst was a fountain, and Don Pedro
knelt beside it, smiling wickedly as he placed
upon the perfumed waters, five oranges cut
in halves, and placed flat-side down. The
reflection was so perfect that any one would be[30]
deceived, and think they were whole oranges
floating upon the water.

"'How many oranges are there here?'
asked the king, smiling genially, and the
judges replied:

"'Ten, may it please your Gracious Majesty.'

"'Nay, but it does not please my Gracious
Majesty to have four fools for judges,' he said.
'Liars! Can you not see that there are but
five?' and he raised two of the halves and held
them together. 'Know, oh, unjust judges,'
he said, sternly, 'that the king's servants
must see more than the surface of things if
they are to conduct that portion of the realm
which it is their business to attend to, and since
you cannot tell a half from a whole, perchance
that is the reason of the tales I hear of your
ill-dealings with the property of some of my
subjects!'

"He ordered them to be beheaded and
their places filled with better men, and the[31]
poor people whom they had defrauded had
their property restored to them. There are
many other stories of King Pedro which are
not pleasant to tell, and it is good to remember
that he sometimes did kind things."

"Thank you," said Fernando. "What is
the Alcazar where the gardens were?"

"It is a very remarkable place, and when
you go to Sevilla you will see it. At first,
hundreds of years ago, when the Romans
were in Spain, it was the house of Cæsar;
afterward the Moors turned it into a fortress,
and it is a perfect example of Moorish
work. Don Pedro rebuilt it, and spent
a great deal of money upon it, making it
the most beautiful palace in all Spain. All
manner of things happened there, among
them the murder of Don Pedro's half-brother,
Don Fadrique, who he was afraid would lay
claim to the throne.

"But here come your mother and Juanita,[32]
and I think your rest time is about over. Go
and play, and tell Manuel we return at four
o'clock, so you must be on time."

So Fernando spent a delightful afternoon
in the orange grove, and drove home through
the cool twilight, passing the paseo just as
the band was playing the Marche Real, the
national song, which he hummed until he
went to bed.

CHAPTER IV.

AT THE ALHAMBRA


"Mi madre," cried Fernando, rushing into
the house one day in October, "to-day is the
feast-day of the head master, and we have
a holiday. May I have permission to go to
the hill to see Antonio?"

"Not by yourself, my son," replied his
mother, and Fernando said, hastily, "Oh, no,
madre mia, Manuel says that he will take me
if you will permit me, and, if Juanita's nurse
could be spared, we could take the niña, as
she has never been there, and that would give
her pleasure."

"Let me see," his mother paused a moment,
"the day is fine. This morning I am busy,
but after luncheon I will drive thither with the[34]
little one, and leave you for an hour while
I go on to the villa of the Señora Sanchez; but
you must be a good boy, and mind Manuel."

"Yes, mother, and you will see Antonio,
whom I like best of all the boys at school,"
said Fernando, and he hastened away to make
ready for the great treat. A drive with his
mother in school hours was a pleasure seldom
indulged in, and a visit to the great hill which
crowns Granada was treat enough, but to take
Juanita,&mdash;these were things so pleasant that
he said to himself, "I think my guardian
angel must have whispered in my mother's
ear to give me all this pleasure."

It was about two o'clock as they drove
through the narrow streets of the city up
the steep and hilly way which led to the outskirts
of the town.

"You are going to see the nicest boy in
Granada, and the most wonderful castle in
Spain, niña," said Fernando to Juanita, and[35]
the two children chattered merrily as the carriage
went slowly up the hill.

"Here is a riddle I heard at school, niña,
see if you can guess it,&mdash;


  
    
"'Guarded in a prison strait,
Ivory gaolers round her wait,
Venomous snake of sanguine hue,
Mother of all the lies that brew!'"


"I do not know," said his little sister,
wonderingly. She thought all that Fernando
said and did was perfection. "What is it,
Nando?"

"Why, the tongue, of course," he said,
pleased to have given a riddle which she could
not guess; and his mother said:

"That is a very good riddle, and I hope
you will remember it, for it is the tongue
which makes much mischief in this world.
Remember that 'a stone and a word flung
do not return.'"

"There is Mazo following us," said Juanita,
and her mother said, laughingly, "Really,[36]
Fernando, I don't see why you like that dog
so much! He is uglier than Picio."[2]

"He isn't handsome, but you have told me
that handsome is as handsome does!" said
her son, and his mother laughed again.

"Oh, what is that?" cried Juanita, as the
carriage made a turn, and some splendid great
towers came into view.

"That is the Alhambra," said Fernando.
"It is the most wonderful castle in Spain.
Manuel said it was begun in 1238, in the
reign of the Moorish king, Ibn-l-Ahmar, and
it was years and years in building. He says
the Moors used to have the castle and the city
of Granada, and I read in my history of how
the Catholic king, Ferdinand, came here to
conquer it. He fought and fought, but the
Moors wouldn't give it up. I think they were
a brave people, if they were beaten, don't you?"
[37]
"Yes, my son, they were very brave, but
they did such cruel things to the captives
they took, that it is not surprising that the
Spaniards wanted to conquer them," said his
mother.

"They captured Christian girls, and forced
them to become their wives, though what they
wanted with them I cannot see, for they already
had many wives, and I should think one was
enough for any man. Where shall we find
your friend, Fernando? If you wish I will
leave you with him for an hour, and continue
my drive."

"Oh, thank you, mother, I knew you would
let me stay!" cried Fernando; and Juanita
said, "Please leave me, too, mother, that I
may see Antonio and the great palace."

"Antonio lives within the palace, mamma,"
said Fernando. "He was born there, and he
and his sister, Pepita, have never been away.
He is to go to the English school at Gibraltar,[38]
but not until he is bigger. May we ask some
one where he is?"

"Certainly. He must be a nice boy to
have lived always in such a place, and to have
you so devoted to him. There is a guard;
ask him where the apartments of the boy's
father are," she said to Manuel, who sat
upon the box with the coachman. Further
inquiry, however, was not necessary, for, as the
carriage made its way up the broad drive
shaded with magnificent elm-trees, which the
Duke of Wellington planted, a boy came
bounding toward them.

"There he is," cried Fernando. "Antonio,
come here, we have come to see you."

The carriage stopped, and Fernando hopped
out as lightly as a squirrel, giving Antonio
a good hug, for Spanish boys are never
ashamed of showing that they like their friends.
Antonio's cap was off in a trice and he smiled
and bowed as Fernando presented him to his[39]
mother and little sister. Antonio was a handsome
boy, with eyes as dark and blue as the
sapphire of the Spanish skies, and fair hair
tossed back from an open brow. All Spaniards
are not dark, and, in Andalusia, the
province in which Granada lies, there are
many blonds.

"I will leave Fernando and Juanita with you
for a visit," said the señora, graciously. "Will
you bring them here in an hour?"

"Si, señora," said Antonio. "But if you
would so honour us, the señora, my mother has
prepared a little luncheon in the Garden of
Lindaraya at four o'clock, and she would be
most happy if you would partake of it with us."

"Thank you, then I shall allow the children
to remain with you until that time and I shall
myself prolong my visit with my friends at
the villa," she replied. "When I return I
shall do myself the pleasure of meeting your
mother."

[40]



"THEY PLAYED HIDE AND SEEK THROUGH THE MARBLE HALLS."


So she drove off, and the children tripped
happily away, followed closely by Manuel and
Dolores, for Spanish little ones of good family
are never allowed to go about alone. However,
one must relax a little sometimes, and the
two attendants saw a pleasant hour before them
as they sat idly about while the children played
in the wonderful gardens of the palace. Pepita,
Antonio's sister, was but a year older than
Juanita, and the two little girls were quite
happy together, and the boys did not consider
themselves too big to play with them. They
played hide and seek through the marble halls,
and tag and chaser about the flower beds.
The little girls played house and made mud
pies, although Dolores objected to this and
told Juanita that she would be as dirty as the
"caseada de Burguillos"[3] if she were not more
careful. Juanita thought Pepita was wonderful[41]
because she had been born in a palace, and
her father was custodian of the wonderful
place, but it was Antonio who claimed her
greatest admiration. He was even more marvellous
than Fernando, she almost thought,
because he was bigger, and his eyes had such a
kind and merry look, and he always carried
her over the rough places in his strong young
arms, and lifted her over the walls as they
strolled through the gardens.

She had never seen such gardens as these of
the Alhambra. They were full of the most
beautiful flowers, and there was the most delicious
scent in the air.

Antonio told her it was from the wallflowers,
which grew here in great profusion, and were
twice as large as they were in other places. But
besides them there were great trees of purple
heliotrope, the blooms as large around as
Juanita's big hat; and geranium-trees, taller
than a man, with orange-trees in bloom, late[42]
though it was, and with the ripe fruit upon
their branches also.

Then the children had a charming luncheon
on the grass, for Antonio's mother set forth for
them all manner of good things,&mdash;a dainty
salad with some cold meat, thick chocolate in
tiny cups, and cakes in the daintiest of shapes.
What a merry picnic it was beneath the shade
of the great orange-tree which Antonio told
them had been there for over a hundred years,
and from which the great American, Washington
Irving, had picked fruit when he lived at
the Alhambra! Then when the party was
over, and his mother had not come, Fernando
said:

"Antonio, tell us a story. You know some
about the castle, I am sure." And little
Juanita begged, "Do please tell us one, Antonio,"
and as nobody could ever resist the
niña's wistful, brown eyes, Antonio smilingly
began the story of "The Three Sisters."





[43]




CHAPTER V.

ANTONIO'S STORY


"Once upon a time," Antonio began,
"there were in the palace of the Alhambra
three princesses whose names were Zayde,
Zorayde and Zorahayda. They were daughters
of the Sultan, for it was in the days when
the Moors reigned in Granada, and there were
no Christians here but captive Spaniards. The
princesses were kept in a tower called the
Tower of the Infantas, one of the most beautiful
towers of the Alhambra. It was fitted up
in a manner befitting the home of the king's
daughters. The walls of the room were hung
with tapestries in cloth of gold and royal blue;
the divans were heaped high with pillows, the
pillars and arches which held up the roof itself,[44]
were in filigree of softest hues,&mdash;blue, terra-cotta,
and gold. The Princess Zayde's chamber
was the richest, all in cloth of gold, since
she was the eldest Infanta; that of Zorayde
was hung with steel mirrors, burnished bright,
for she was most fair to look upon and loved
to look upon herself; while that of the youngest,
little brown-eyed Princess Zorahayda, was
delicate in tone, as if some rare jewel lay in
a dainty casket. Upon the princesses waited
the discreet Kadiga, an elderly duenna who
never let them from her sight for a moment.
She watched them as a cat does a mouse, but
there was one thing she could not control, and
that was the eyes of the princesses. They
would look forth from the windows, and, indeed,
this Kadiga never forbade, for it seemed
to her a pity that three such fair maidens
should have so little amusement, and she
thought it could not possibly hurt them to
gaze into the gardens below.

[45]

"One day, while the princesses were looking
out the narrow windows, they saw something
which made them look and look again. Yes, it
was true,&mdash;could it be? it was! They were
the very same&mdash;the three Christian princes
whom they had seen at Salobrena; but here
they were labouring as captives. At the tourney
to which the princesses had been taken,
they had seen these noble knights, and had
fallen in love with them, and it was for this that
their father had shut them up in a tower, for he
had said no daughter of his should marry a
Christian.

"But the knights thought differently, and
they had come to Granada in the hope of finding
their princesses, and had been taken captive
and were compelled to hard labour.

"'It is he!' cried Zayde. 'The knight
with the scarlet tunic is the one I saw!'

"'Yes, but the one in blue, he is mine!'
cried Zorayde.
[46][47]
"Little Zorahayda said nothing, but she
looked with all her eyes at the third knight.
And this was not the last time she saw him,
for the knights had come thither, bent on
rescuing the maidens, and had bribed their
jailer to help them to escape. So one moonlight
night, when the moon was turning into
silver beauty the orange-trees of the garden,
and shining in fullest light into the deep
ravine below the Tower of the Infantas, the
knights awaited their lady-loves in the valley
below, and Kadiga let them down by a rope-ladder.

"All escaped in safety but little Zorahayda,
and she feared to go.

"'Leave me,' she cried. 'I must not
leave my father!' and at last, since they could
not persuade her to go, they rode sadly away
without her, and her little white hand waved a
sad farewell to them from the window. There
she still is, so say the legends, and there are[48]
those who, walking in these gardens at midnight,
tell that they have seen a white hand
wave from the tower window, and a voice
whisper through the murmur of the fountains,
'Ay di mi Zorahayda!'"

"Oh, Antonio! hast thou seen her?" cried
Juanita, and her brother laughed, and said:

"Little foolish one, it is but a story! But
Antonio, tell us a tale of battle, for this is but
a woman's story, and there have been splendid
deeds done in this old castle."

"Splendid ones, and sorry ones as well,"
said Antonio, who was old for his twelve
years, and had lived so long in the atmosphere
of romance that he seemed a part of it, in
speech and manners. "Shall I tell you of the
taking of the Alhambra from the Moors? It
was a glorious fight, and both sides were brave
men."

Then he told them of the conquest of
Granada, when Christian knight and Moor
fought valiantly for the possession of the
splendid city, with its gem, the Alhambra. He
told of how the noble knight, Juan de Véga,
was sent to demand tribute from Muley ben
Hassan, King of Granada, and that fierce old
monarch said:

"Return to your sovereigns, O Spaniard,
and tell them that the kings of Granada who
paid tribute are all dead. My mint coins only
swords!" Brave words, but it was his son,
Boabdil the Unlucky, who was forced to surrender
the castle to the victorious enemy, and
who handed the keys to the Spaniards, as he
rode through the gate of the Siete Suelos,
saying: "Go, possess these fortresses which
Allah has taken from me, but grant me this
one boon, that none other shall pass under
this gateway from which I have come out."
And Ferdinand granted his request and walled
up the gate, so that, from that day to this, no
one has passed through that entrance.

[49]

These and other tales Antonio told them,
and the afternoon passed so quickly that the
children were surprised when their mother's
voice warned them that it was time to go
home.

"Oh, mamma," they cried, "must we go?"
and the señora smilingly waited a little, chatting
with Antonio's mother, while he picked a
huge bunch of flowers for the children to
carry away with them. Then the good-byes
were said, and they drove away crying:

"Come soon to see us, Antonio." To
which he replied, in pleasant Spanish fashion:

"Thank you well, and very much for your
visit!"

"Isn't he a nice boy?" said Juanita.

"Quite a little Don," her mother answered,
smiling. "Fernando, I am glad to see that
you have the sense to choose your friends so
well," and Fernando grinned, boylike, well
pleased.

[50]

"Oh, who is that?" Juanita asked, as a
fantastic figure approached.

"That is the gipsy king," said her mother.
"You know the gipsies live all huddled together
there, below the Alhambra, and they
have a chief whom they call king. They are
a lazy set, doing little but thieving and telling
fortunes. They live in little burrows, like
rabbits, set into the hillsides, and there are pigs,
goats, and dogs all living together with the
people."

"That girl with the king is very pretty,"
said Fernando, "with her black hair and eyes,
and her bright skirts, and the pomegranate
flower behind her ear."

"The pomegranate is the flower of Granada,
you know," said his mother, "and
it does look pretty in her dark hair. Hear
her call her dogs! Gipsy dogs are all named
Melampo, Cubilon, or Lubina, after the shepherd
dogs who followed the shepherds, and[51]
saw our Lord at Bethlehem. Ah, Juanita,
'Jesus, Maria y Josef!' You must not
sneeze! Drive faster, Diego, and Dolores,
wrap the baby in that Palencian blanket, so
soft and warm. The nights grow cool quickly
at this time of year."

"Why do we always say 'Jesus, Maria y
Josef!' when people sneeze?" asked Fernando.

"It has been the custom so long that people
have almost forgotten why it is done," replied
his mother; "but I remember my grandmother
saying once that her mother told her
the reason. Years and years ago, in 1580,
there was in all Andalusia a terrible plague
called the mosquillo. People sneezed once, and
lo! they had the plague, and little could save
them, though some few recovered. So it
grew to be the custom, when one sneezed, for
those who heard him to look pityingly upon
him and say, 'Dios le ayude,'[4] or call upon the[52]
holy names to help him, saying, 'Jesus, Maria
y Josef.'"[5]

"See that ragged beggar, mamma," said
Juanita. "May we not give him something?"
as a little boy came hopping along
beside the carriage, crying, lustily:

"Una limosna por el amor de Dios,[6] señora!"

"I have no centimos,"[7] said the señora,
"and it is not wise to give more to a beggar,
but you can always give politeness, niña, and
when you have no money say, 'Perdone me,
usted,'[8] or, 'Por el amor de Dios,'[9] and thus you
will not give offence to God's poor."





[53]


CHAPTER VI.

THE HOLIDAYS


Fernando had been three months in school
and was beginning to grow tired, when it came
time for the feast of Christmas, and he was very
happy in the thought of all he was to do and
see during his holiday. He and Juanita were
very much excited in preparing their nacimento,
which nearly every Spanish child has at Christmas
time. This is a plaster representation of
the birth of Christ. There are in it many figures,
a manger surrounded with greens, the
Baby Our Lord, St. Joseph, and the Blessed
Virgin, the Wise Men worshipping the Holy
Child, and angels hovering near, as well as the
patient ox and ass who were his first worshippers.
Juanita was wild with excitement as[54]
these were all grouped and set in place. She
was only four and did not well remember the
Christmas before, so that it was all new to
her.

Christmas Eve there was a grand family
party, all the relatives coming to the home of
Fernando and partaking of a supper of sweetmeats
and wine. In the morning there was, of
course, early Mass in the great cathedral,
where the choir sang divinely. It started way
up in the loft to sing the Adeste Fideles, the
Church's Christmas hymn for centuries, slowly
coming nearer and nearer; and Juanita thought
it was an angel choir until she saw it come into
sight and the glorious voices rolled forth in a
volume of song.

Then the children had breakfast and they
made their aguinaldo, for every servant on the
place expected a present as surely as did the
old darkies of Southern days. The postman,
the errand boy, the porter, the sereno who walks[55]
the street all night with his lantern, trying
your door to see if it is locked properly, and
assuring you that all is well as the hours
strike,&mdash;all must be remembered. Then the
señora took the carriage, and the children
accompanied her, as she filled it with sweetmeats
for the poor children and such of her
special protégés as could not come to the
house for their aguinaldo.

It was a cold day, for Granada grows cold in
the winter time, and is not like other Spanish
cities, which have summer all the year. The
wind sweeps down from the Sierras and brings
with it a blustering hint of mountain snows;
and as the houses have no furnaces and seldom
good stoves to heat them, even the rich can
suffer, and the poor do suffer bitterly.

While the sun shines it matters not, for the
sun of Andalusia is so warm and bright that it
blesses all who lie beneath it; but when the
dark days come or evening's mantle falls upon[56]
the town, people hover close about the brazero
and long for summer.

With Fernando it mattered little, for he was
seldom still enough to be cold, and he spent a
merry Christmas, falling asleep to dream of
delightful things, and waking to the happy
thought that it would soon be the feast of the
Circumcision. This is New Year's Day, and
is celebrated with much festivity in Spain. The
evening before there is a grand party for the
grown-ups, and slips of paper are passed
around, one being drawn by each person.
They are in pairs, so that the one who draws
number one must go to supper with number
one, and great merriment is made over the pairing
off of the guests. The gentleman has to
send a bunch of flowers or sweets to the lady
whose number he draws, and not a few matches
have been made in Spain by this merry custom.

Fernando and Juanita, however, were quite[57]
otherwise engaged. They were sent early to
bed and were dreaming of the sugar-plums of
the morrow, wondering whom they would first
meet, for they think in Spain that what happens
to you on New Year's Day will determine
the course of the whole year. If you meet a
pauper you will have bad luck, but if you see
a man with gold in his pocket, you will have
money all the year.

Merrier still was the feast of the Three
Kings, which is the day upon which little
Spanish children have gifts made them as
American children do at Christmas. This is
in honour of the Wise Men having brought
presents to Our Lord on that day, so that on
the eve of January sixth, the feast of the
Epiphany, Fernando and Juanita set their little
shoes on their balcony with a wisp of straw to
feed the Magi's horses, and with many surmises
as to what they would find in them on
the morrow. What wonderful things there[58]
were! Fernando had all the things that boys
love,&mdash;tops, marbles, balls, and a fine knife;
while Juanita had a wonderful dolly and all
manner of dainty things for her to wear.
"The Three Kings never make one feel like
the governor of Cartagena," said Fernando, as
he tossed his new ball and lovingly fingered his
knife.

"But there is still another gift for thee and
thy sister," said his father, and he led them
to the door. There stood a wonderful little
donkey, his bridle decorated with streaming
ribbons and bells, his kind eyes blinking as he
turned his head and seemed to say, "Hello,
Little Master, are you and I going to be great
friends?"

"Oh, papa, is that for us?" cried Fernando,
while Juanita clapped her tiny hands with delight.
It took Fernando but a moment to
spring on the donkey's back, but his mother
cried, warningly:

[59]

"Be careful, son! Remember how the little
Prince of Granada rode too fast through the
streets, and fell from his pony and was killed."

"Have no fear," her husband said, smiling,
"the donkey will not go fast enough to hurt
him; that is why I selected him." And
he placed Juanita up behind her brother, bidding
Manuel walk beside them, while Mazo,
unbidden, jumped around.

Everything else that Fernando had sank
into insignificance when compared to the little
donkey, which he named Babieca, and which he
and Juanita rode whenever they had a chance.
Babieca was a kind little beast, though something
of a rogue. He seemed to know that he
must play no tricks when Juanita rode him, and
he behaved himself well; but when Fernando
rode, it was quite another matter. Babieca
would prick up his long ears and go along
quietly, then stop suddenly without saying "by
your leave," and, of course, Fernando would[60]
go over his head. He would not hurt himself
at all, and the naughty little mule would look
at him wonderingly as if to say: "Now what
on earth are you doing down there?" Fernando
soon grew to expect such antics and was
on the lookout for them.



"ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN WHO HAD SUCH ANIMALS DROVE THEM DOWN TO THE CHURCH TO BE BLESSED."


When St. Anthony's Day came, of course
Babieca had to go with the other four-footed
friends of the saint, to be blessed and insured
from all harm through the year. The seventeenth
of January is the day of St. Anthony, patron
of mules, horses, and donkeys, and a grand
parade took place. All the people of the town
who had such animals drove them down to the
church to be blessed and to get a barley wafer.
Many of the animals were gaily decorated with
streamers and ribbons, and some with flowers;
and all along the streets small booths were set
up containing little images of St. Anthony and
barley cakes. Babieca behaved very well at his
blessing, though his refractory tongue did try[61]
to nibble the priest's stole; but some of the
horses kicked and neighed, and, with the braying
of the many donkeys and mules, there
was a din not often heard in staid Granada.

There were no more fêtes for the time being,
and Fernando, a trifle spoiled by all the gaiety,
had to return to his studies again. It was a
long month before carnival time, but his
thoughts went forward to that delightful season,
and it seemed to the little boy as if it
would never come. However, as "all things
come to him who will but wait," the great day
arrived at last, and Fernando was wild with joy.
Carnival time is just before the beginning of
Lent, and is a season of great merriment.
Under a turquoise sky, with no clouds to mar
its fairness, there is a pageant almost like those
of the days of chivalry, and Fernando and
Juanita, attended by their faithful Manuel and
Dolores, saw it all. Fernando dressed as a
page, and his sister as a court lady of the days[62]
of Isabella the Catholic, and they were masked,
as are all the people who throng the streets on
these gay days.

Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday the carnival
continues, each year, and the children are asked
to little dances at the houses of friends, and
also to hear student choirs sing and to see
plays. But what they most enjoy is mingling
in the crowds upon the paseo, throwing confetti
at those who throw at them, seeing the
flower-decked carriages, the wonderful costumes;
monks, nuns, generals, court ladies,
flowers, animals, all are represented,&mdash;all are
laughing and throwing confetti right and left.
Children are selling confetti, crying shrilly,
"Confetti, five centimos a packet. Showers
of a million colours! Only a perro Chico!"[10]
Ah, how gay and delightful it all is! Juanita
saw much, and Dolores lay down at night[63]
thanking the saints that carnival lasted but
three days! But Fernando saw everything,
and poor Manuel's legs were weary as he kept
pace with his little master, now here, now
there, now everywhere, laughing and jesting,
the merriest lad in all the carnival.

Alas, it was all over! Ash Wednesday
dawned, dull and heavy, the weather as sad
and sorry as the day. Fernando dragged himself
to church, where his brow was marked
with ashes according to custom, and gazed
longingly at the Entierro de la sardina, a bit
of pork the size and shape of a sardine, buried
to show that the fast had begun, for no one
in Spain eats meat on Ash Wednesday, and
very little of it in Lent.

Fernando looked so depressed at supper
that his mother asked him:

"What is the trouble, little son, are you ill?"

"No, mamma," he said. "But it is so long
till Easter."

[64]

"Not if you do not think about it," said
his mother with a smile. "Do your work
with a will, and the days will pass quickly.
If you are a good boy, you shall have a treat
at Easter."

"Oh, what will that be," he asked, and
Juanita cried, eagerly, "Shall I have it, too?"

"Both of you," the mother said. "Your
father is going to take us to Sevilla, to see the
grand Easter festival, and we shall see your
brother and sister as well, and your cousins
and your Aunt Isabella, so you must be
good children."

"Indeed we will," cried both, joyously, at
the thought of so much pleasure.





[65]




CHAPTER VII.

EASTER IN SEVILLA


Easter in Sevilla! What a gay and
charming time it is! Flowers are everywhere,
blooming in beauty, and all the people seem
joyous in the thought that the long season
of fasting is over.

Fernando and Juanita had arrived in the
city on the Saturday before Palm Sunday, and
were wild with delight at seeing their cousins,
Mariquita, Pepita, and Angel, and in looking
forward to the delights of the week's holiday
with its processions and fêtes. Beginning with
the beautiful Procession of the Palms, on
Palm Sunday, all through Holy Week are
processions and celebrations, and the little folk
thoroughly enjoy them.

[66]

Their older brother and sister were there,
also, and full of wonderful tales of what they
had done at school. Fernando thought Pablo
was a wonderful being, and that everything he
did was perfect. He could hardly wait until
he himself would be big enough to go away
to college; and little Juanita felt quite the
same way about Augustia, who had learned
many things in the convent.

"Indeed, niña," she said, "it is pleasant
at school with the girls, but that Mother Justina
makes one work so hard, and that the
play-hours are few. I have embroidery to
make, and lessons to say, and my class learns
French as well as Castilian. But the other
girls are charming. Most of all I like Paquita
de Guiteras, an Americana, at least she comes
from the Island of Cuba, and the girls say
that she is an Indian, and that her mother was
an Indian princess married to her father, a
noble Spaniard. Of this I cannot say, and[67]
she herself does not relate, but she says that
in Cuba the Spaniards have often married the
Indians and have been kind to them, and have
not destroyed them as have the Americanos
in the Estados Unidos. Well, niña, Paquita
is the merriest of girls! She has always some
prank to play upon some one, and, indeed,
she cares not if it is the Mother Superior
herself, so she can have her joke. Her aunt,
good Sister Mercedes, is always fretting for
fear lest Paquita should be in disgrace, but it
worries Paquita not at all. One night she did
the funniest thing. There is one girl who
is very mean to the little ones, always teasing
them, and they dare say nothing, as she is
the niece of the Mother Superior, and she
believes nothing against her. This Teresa
Alcantara once found a little girl, and teased
her until Paquita could stand it no longer, and
flew at Teresa and bit her hand. Sister turned
at that moment and saw the bite, but she had[68]
not seen what had gone before, and would not
listen to what I tried to tell her, and Paquita
is always too proud to try to make excuses,
and just looked at Sister so fiercely from
her great black eyes that the Sister was still
more displeased.

"'Thou art but a savage wildcat,' she said,
and took her to Mother Superior for punishment.
She could not have any playtime for
a whole week, and she would have to apologize
to Teresa, too, and I think she hated that
the worst of anything. But she got even with
her, as you shall hear. She found out that
Teresa was terribly afraid of cats, and one
night, when we were all safely tucked away
in our little beds, there came from behind
Teresa's curtains a terrible scream, and she
jumped out of bed and rushed up and down
the dormitory. Such a breach of decorum
was never seen before, and the nuns were
shocked to a degree. Teresa kept shrieking,[69]
'A wild beast is in my bed! a wild beast is in
my bed!' and after calming her down they
went to investigate. What do you think they
found? A feather duster! It was tucked
under the sheets, and who could have put it
there? No one knew, but every one felt that
Paquita was the only one who could have
thought of such mischief. But the sisters
did not try to find out, for one of them had
seen Teresa teasing the little girl, and knew
why Paquita disliked her so much; and after
that the big bully let us little ones alone."

"Oh, it must be so nice," sighed Juanita,
but Pablo laughed, and said that those were
girl's stories, and that far more exciting things
happened at the naval college, especially when
they all went on a cruise.

On Easter Sunday morning the children
went to the cathedral to see the wonderful
dances which take place but three times a
year. Fernando and Juanita were struck[70]
dumb with the beautiful cathedral, so unlike
the Gothic one of Granada; for this one at
Sevilla is a Saracenic church, built hundreds
of years ago, begun by the Moorish Sultan,
Yakub al Mansour, in 1184.



"THEIR BODIES SWAYED TO AND FRO IN TIME TO THE MUSIC."


How strange it seemed to see dancing in
church! Fernando and Juanita sat beside
their mother, on their little camp-stools, for
there are no pews in Spanish churches. The
whole centre of the church is empty, and people
kneel there during the mass, or if they are
too tired or too little to stand, they rent camp-stools
for half a cent, and an old woman who
has them in charge hobbles along with a stool,
which they may keep while the service lasts.

The men generally stand, and it is interesting
to see them settle themselves in a comfortable
position when the sermon begins, and
stand there almost without moving while the
preacher speaks, sometimes a half-hour, sometimes
a whole hour. But the hearers do not[71]
seem to mind, for these Spanish monks are
very fine preachers.

As the children gazed at the beautiful altar
covered with flowers, there came the sound
of music,&mdash;violins, flutes, flageolets, and hautboys
all making a quaint harmony,&mdash;and with
the music was mingled the sound of youthful
voices, fresh and sweet, and a band of boys
entered the chancel, and gliding down the
altar steps danced quietly, singing as they
danced. Their bodies swayed to and fro in
time to the music, at first slowly, then, as
the time quickened, castanets click-clicked with
the other sounds, and the boys moved faster
and faster, still in perfect time, yet not with
wild abandon, but rather with dignified respect
for the place. They were quaintly dressed
in the court costumes of the Middle Ages; on
their heads were big Spanish hats, turned up
at one side with a sweeping blue feather, a
mantle of light blue was over one shoulder,[72]
their vests were of white satin, their hose
and shoes of white. The boys danced on
until the great bells of the Giralda rang out,
and then they vanished, the music growing
softer and softer, until its last strains
sounded far away, like a floating wave of
heavenly harmony.

"How pretty the dance was," said little
Juanita, as they walked home from the service.
"Why do they dance in church?"

"The Holy Scriptures say that David danced
before the Lord," her mother answered, "so
perhaps that is the reason the Sevillians think
this is a form of worship, but you must ask
your cousins to tell you how it was first done."

"Do tell me, Mariquita," said the little girl,
and her cousin said, "I do not know how it
happened at first, but it has been done ever
since the Moors were here in Sevilla. Only
once in hundreds of years has it been stopped,
and then an archbishop said it was not right to[73]
have dancing in church. He made every one
very angry, for the people said, 'What our
fathers did is good enough for us!' So they
went to the Pope, and he said that he could
not tell unless he saw the dance. So the boys
and the musicians were taken to Rome, and
there danced before the Holy Father, who
said, 'I see no harm in this, any more than in
the children's hosannas before Our Lord when
He entered Jerusalem. Let them have their
dance so long as the clothes which they wear
may last.' Then they came back and so determined
were they to continue it for ever, that
they never let the clothes wear out to this day.
If one piece of a suit shall be worn it is so
quickly mended or repaired that no suit has
ever worn out all at once, so that these are the
same suits as those worn long ago."

"I am so glad they still have it," said Fernando,
"for I wouldn't have missed seeing it
to-day for anything."





[74]




CHAPTER VIII.

RAINY DAYS


"Mamma, would you allow me to go to the
bull-fight with father and Pablo?" asked Fernando
next day.

"No, indeed, my son, a bull-fight is no
place for women and children," his mother
replied. "I have never been to one in all my
life, and Juanita shall never attend. I wish
Pablo did not care to go, either, but he must
do as he wishes now that he is grown. A boy
cannot always be at his mother's girdle, but you
must be much bigger than now before you will
see such a sight."

Fernando sighed, but he knew that there
was no use saying more, for the word of la
madre was law. He was very anxious to see a[75]
bull-fight, for every boy in Spain desires that
above all things. The fights are held on all
holidays, but the finest one of all is at Easter.
The immense amphitheatre of Sevilla holds
thousands of spectators, men wild with excitement
over the sport, and even women, though
the most refined ladies do not frequent the
corridos. The bull is turned loose in the
centre of the huge ring and tormented until
he is ready to fight. Men with sharp-pointed
darts, called banderillos, tease him by throwing
their barbs at him, and pricking his skin until
he is nearly crazy. Then men mounted on
horseback, the picadores, wave scarlet cloths
before his eyes, exciting him still more, for
a bull hates red worse than anything in the
world. He dashes at the cruel cloth, and
sometimes is too quick for the man who
carries it, tossing him on his horns, but generally
it is the poor horse who is killed, and
the man jumps away to safety. The matador[76]
is the one who slays the bull, and he is sometimes
killed himself. It is a terribly cruel
affair, though Spaniards say it is not so cruel
as our prize-fighting.

It was late that evening when Fernando
went to bed, and ere he did so there was quite
an excitement. They were all seated upon
the piazza of the house, he and Juanita, his
cousins and their elders, when there was a
great cry from the street, "The toro! The
toro!" and a clatter of horses' hoofs. All
screamed loudly, for to have a bull escape from
the pens is a frequent occurrence, and not a
very pleasant one. The cries became louder,
the horses' hoofs beat nearer and nearer, and
as in the dusk a figure dashed down the street,
the señora, screaming loudly, caught Juanita
to her and tried to climb the pillar at her side.
She was very stout, and the pillar was very
slippery, and she could not climb with one
arm, so she slid down as fast as she climbed[77]
up, squealing all the time, "A toro, Madre
di Dios! a toro!"

Fernando was frightened, too, but he was
a brave boy, and he tried his best to push
his mother up out of danger, boosting her as
she slipped down, but not helping very much,
as you might suppose. It seemed to him an
hour, but it was only a minute before servants
came from the house, and as they did so a
horse dashed up before the pillars, and, stopped
too hastily by his rider, slid along the stones
on his hind feet. On his back was Pablo,
waving his sombrero, and crying, "What a
corrido! It was glorious! Six bulls to die,
and Rosito never in such form! But, madre
mia, what is the matter?" as he sprang from
his horse and assisted his mother to a seat.

The señora could not speak, but Fernando
said, "We thought the noise was a bull escaped,
and I was assisting my mother to a
height of safety."

[78]

Pablo looked at the little figure speaking
so gravely, then threw back his head and
shouted with laughter, but seeing Fernando's
hurt expression, stopped quickly, and said:

"Bravo, little brother, thou art a good
knight to care for thy mother and sister!"

"Better than thou!" His mother had regained
her voice by this time.

"Thou art still the same Pablo, and will yet
be the death of thy poor mother," but Pablo
kissed her hand so gallantly, and begged her
pardon so amiably, that she quite forgave him.

Next day, alas! it was raining, and it rained
so hard all that day, and nearly all of the next,
that the children were like little bears in a cage.
They played with everything they could think
of, but after awhile they grew restless and
quarrelled so that the grown-up folk grew
nervous, too.

At last, Mariquita's father, gay and charming
Uncle Ruy, came to the rescue.

[79]

"Who wants to take a trip into the country
with me?" he asked, and as each one squealed
"I!" he said:

"Of course we can't go, really, but we can
make believe, and I shall take you to a hacienda
outside the old wall of Sevilla.

"It lies amidst orange and olive groves, and
all kinds of flowers, and many of the things
we eat come from that very place. Who
knows how they pickle olives?"

"Are olives pickled?" asked Juanita, and
Mariquita said:

"How queer it seems that all the things we
eat have to go through so much before they
can be eaten. I did not know that olives had
to be pickled."

"Yes, mi niña, and we will play that we are
visiting an olive grove, and we can see the
way the olives are picked and made ready for
food. See, here are the trees, and the fruit is
picked from them and placed in baskets.[80]
There are two kinds of olives used, green and
ripe, the green ones are picked just before they
begin to turn soft. These are separated from
the others, and the bitter taste is removed
by soaking in fresh water for a long time, or
some picklers soak them for a shorter time
in a solution of potash lye. This softens the
skin and extracts all bitterness, but the olives
must be soaked in clear water, which is frequently
changed to get all the potash off.
Then they are placed in weak brine, and afterward
in stronger, until they have the salty
taste which we like so much. Then they are
put in small barrels and taken to the bottling
rooms, where they are bottled and labelled
for the market."

"How is the oil made?" asked Fernando.

"That is harder to do, but it is very
interesting to watch. The fresh olives are
carefully picked, dried a little, and then crushed.
Old-fashioned stone mills are used to crush the[81]
fruit, and the mass is pressed to extract the
liquid which contains all the watery juice as
well as the oil and pulp."

"What do they do after it is pressed?"
asked Fernando.

"They let it stand for a month and the
refuse goes to the bottom. Then the oil is
poured off and allowed to stand another month,
when the process is repeated. After the third
time the oil is ready for use. The best oil is
made in this way, as it keeps its colour and
flavour better by the settling process than when
it is filtered.

"In some places the olives are placed on a
platform and the millstone is placed over them.
This is turned round and round by means of a
pole to which a donkey is hitched, and the mass
which is turned out is placed in rush baskets,
which are put under a press which is screwed
down by five or six men, so that the oil is
squeezed out, but that is a very old-fashioned[82]
way of making oil, and there are better ways
now. They still use this, however, when there
is a big crop, and they want to get the fruit
made into oil as rapidly as possible. Great
care must be taken that everything is clean and
that the oil does not become rancid, or it will
all be spoiled."

"Is everything we eat so interesting?"
asked Juanita.

"The things we eat and wear, too," her
uncle answered, "and nothing in all Sevilla
is more interesting than the way of making
silk."

"How is that done?" asked Fernando.

"I am afraid I could not make you understand
it all, unless you could go to the silk
manufactory, and even then it would be hard
for you. But I can tell you about the cocoons,
and that is the strangest thing about it. The
silkworm was first brought to Europe from
India in 530, when monks brought it to the[83]
Emperor Justinian. The silkworm is a kind
of a caterpillar which feeds on the leaves of the
white mulberry-tree, and lays his eggs in a
kind of gummy substance on the leaves in the
end of June to be hatched out in the following
April. The caterpillar is small at first, about
a quarter of an inch long, but grows to be three
inches in length. By means of a substance in
their mouths the silkworms spin out silky
strands which form cocoons, each fibre being
about eight hundred yards long. When ready
for weaving, the cocoons are placed in an oven
at a gentle heat which kills the chrysalis so
that the silk fibres can be removed and
wound."

"How do they get the silk wound?
Doesn't it break?" asked Fernando.

"It is rather hard to do," his uncle answered,
"but they learn to be very careful, and
the cocoon is soaked in warm water which
loosens the little filaments. When the cocoons[84]
are reeled the first step has been taken, and the
reeled silk is called raw silk, from which all silk
products are made."



"THEY WENT TO THE ALCAZAR GARDENS."


"I wish we could see it all, but perhaps we
can sometime when we are here again," said
Fernando. "Oh, it has stopped raining!"

"Yes, indeed, and the Guadalquiver has
overflowed its banks," said Pablo, coming in at
that moment. "There has not been such a
freshet for years. Come along with me, Nando,
and we will go boating in the streets. I
climbed to the top of the Giralda, and the
whole country looks like a great sea."

"Oh, may I go with Pablo and see?" cried
Fernando, and his mother, with many injunctions
to Pablo to take care of him, said "Yes."

They went to the Alcazar gardens, those most
wonderful gardens of Spain, and as it was early
spring the flowers and insects were making
merry in the sunshine, which had come back
with renewed force, after its vacation. Scarcely[85]
tumbled by the rain, lovely banksia roses were
climbing over the walls, the rosy, blossoming
judas-trees, tinted acacias, and pink almonds
were in bloom, and orange-trees were bursting
into fragrant beauty. Violets and tulips, yellow
oxalis, wild hyacinths, and the scarlet
dragon-flower carpeted the ground, while tall
white lilies, like fair maidens, and stately iris
with sword-like leaves, reminding one of the
knights of chivalry who once walked these
paths, stood sentinel adown the walks. Fernando
saw, too, the insects which flitted among
the branches, beetles with bright green coats
like emeralds, white and gold butterflies, birds
with brilliant wings and sweet voices. But
Pablo was thinking more of sport than of
nature, and he hurried along until they found
a man and a boat to row them, and what a gay
sail they had right down the main streets of
the town! Past the cathedral steps and the
Golden Tower where Columbus piled up gold[86]
brought from the New World, Sevillians say,
and all the other interesting sights of the city,
so that Fernando came home tired and happy,
to tell Juanita of the wonderful things he had
seen.

"I do not wonder that they say, 'He whom
God loves has a house in Sevilla,'" he said.
"It is so beautiful a city."

"Truly,&mdash;


  
    
"'Quien no ha vista Sevilla
No ha vista un maravillo.'"[11]


said Mariquita boastingly, but little Juanita
prattled in reply the Grenadino's favourite response&mdash;


  
    
"'Quien no ha vista Grenada
No ha vista nada.'"[12]






[87]


CHAPTER IX.

TO THE COUNTRY


Home again! At first it seemed to Fernando
as if he could never go back to school,
for after his week of fêtes and processions and
fun, lessons were dull things, but he soon
fell into the old ways, and there were so many
pleasant things at home that he did not pine
for Sevilla at all.

He had a pet lamb&mdash;what boy has not in
spring-time in Spain?&mdash;and he was devoted
to it for awhile, trying to feed it all manner
of things.

"Manuel," he said one day, "I do not
know what is wrong with my pet lamb. It
will not eat the things I give it. I have never
seen so stubborn a thing. Mazo is far different.[88]
It will eat anything at all, but the lamb
stands and stares at me, and shuts its mouth,
no matter what I offer him."

"Lambs are always stubborn," said Manuel.
"They do not eat much but milk when they
are so young. But here, I have a new kite;
will you fly it?"

"Indeed I will," cried the boy, and in an
instant the lamb was forgotten, and he was
skipping down the street, his kite skimming
the air like a gaily coloured bird.

It was a beautiful spring in Granada, and
Fernando spent every minute out of doors
unless actually compelled to be in school or in
bed. The family ate in the lovely patio where
the flowers were beginning to blossom, and
the sun was not too warm to do without the
awning, which in summer stretched overhead.
If it was not kites in which he was interested,
it was marbles and ball, or even a play bull-fight;
and Fernando was very proud when he[89]
was chosen to be "toro," and put his head in
a basketwork affair with points like horns, and
the boys chased him with sticks, running, jumping,
and dodging when he turned and charged
them as he had heard that the bulls did at
the real corridos.

Best of all, it was time to have his head
shaved, and of all things that was what he
liked. His mother mourned, for the boy's
hair was naturally curly, and in winter was
as soft and pretty as black velvet. But all
Spanish boys have their heads shaved in summer,
and Fernando must be like the rest. It
was cut so close that it made him look very
funny, and his great black eyes shone like
beads in his lean brown face, with no soft hair
to soften its harsh outlines.

Fernando and Antonio were still devoted
friends. They played together after school
and on the holidays, and many delightful
times did the two boys have, either in the[90]
Alhambra or at Fernando's home, where there
were many city sights as interesting to Antonio
as the delights of the old palace were
to Fernando.

So devoted had they become that Fernando
felt very sorry to leave his friend when the
time came for him to accompany his mother
and sister to their country home. Generally
he had been delighted to go to the hacienda,
and enjoyed the country school even more
than the one he attended in the city, but this
year he felt so badly over it that his father said:

"Never mind, my son. I shall bring Antonio
out to visit you when school is over,
and you may have a fine time together at the
hacienda." This made Fernando more contented,
and he went away with his parents
quite happily.

As they started for the country on a bright
May day, Juanita said, "Oh, mamma, see that
strange cow! It is all dressed with flower-wreaths,[91]
and has bells around its neck and
flowers on its horns. Why does that young
girl lead it, and that old blind man walk behind,
and blow that horn and beat the drum?"

"That is a cow to be won in a lottery," said
the señora. "Manuel, stop; I wish to buy a
ticket. How we Spaniards do love a game
of chance! See, I shall buy a ticket for each
one of you, and maybe your number will
win the prize."

"Oh, thank you, mamma!" both children
cried, for neither had ever had a lottery
ticket before.

"Now I wish you to stop at a cigar-store,
and buy a stamp[13] for my letter to your Aunt
Isabella, and then we will drive on."

As they turned into the main street leading
to the Alameda, Juanita asked, "Oh, mi madre,
what are those people sitting in the streets
making?"
[92]
"Haven't you seen the ice-cream makers
before?" said the señora. "No, I think you
cannot remember last summer, can you? The
gipsies go up to the Sierras in the very early
morning, and get donkey-loads of snow, and
the people make ice-cream in those pails with
the snow in it. They sit right at their doors
on the sidewalk and make the fresh cream,
and any one can buy a glass of it."

"Do let us have some," cried the children,
and their indulgent mother ordered the horses
stopped while they ate some of the delicious
fresh cream.

As the carriage rolled on down the steep
street, so narrow that as Manuel said "one
can hardly pass another after a full dinner,"
the swineherd was just coming out for the day,
and Juanita cried:

"Oh, madre! See that man with the pipe
in his mouth; what queer music he plays!
What is he?"

[93]

"He is the swineherd, niña. See, he comes
from his alley, staff in hand," the señora said.
"Watch him blow his pipe without turning
his head, and the pigs come after him, as if he
had charmed them. Little and big, dark and
light, fat and scrawny, there they come following
him to pasture. Every alley we pass adds
some curly tail to the procession. Now he
is ready to turn out of the town into that
grove, and see what an army of piggies follows
him! He never looks for any of them, but
they hear the music of his pipe and start
because they learned long ago that it leads
them to good pastures."

"I think they are too funny for anything,"
said the little girl. "Does he bring them back
at night?"

"Yes, and every little piggy knows his own
alley, and goes right home with a little frisk
of his curly tail to say 'good night,'" said
her mother, smiling.

[94]

"See those oxen; are they not splendid
fellows? I love to see them draw their loads
so easily. Beautiful creamy creatures, with
their dark points and their great, soft eyes."

"What is that wooden thing over their
heads?" asked Juanita.

"That is the yoke to couple them together.
They are the gentlest animals in the world,
these great, hornèd beasts, and the driver
walks in front of them with a stick over his
shoulder, which he seldom thinks of using."

"Oh, what a cunning little donkey!" cried
the little girl, as they passed a tiny donkey
laden with panniers filled with flowers, fruit,
vegetables, bread, fowls, and even a water-jar.
"How prettily he is clipped, all in a pattern."

"Mamma," said Fernando, "some of the
donkeys that the gipsies have clipped have
mottoes and pictures on them. I know a boy
whose donkey has 'Viva mi Amo'[14] on his side.[95]
I don't like that, for if the donkey doesn't
love his master, it is telling a story."

His mother laughed. "We will hope he
has a good little master, and then the donkey
will care for him and not be telling a falsehood
with his fur.

"But here we are almost to the hacienda,
and how short the ride has seemed. Now if
two children I know are good, we shall have
a delightful summer, and although you are
to be in the country, and thou, Fernando, will
go to a country school, remember the saying
of thy fathers:


  
    
"'Quando fueres par despoblado
Non hagas desaquisado,
Porque quando fueres per poblado
Iras a lo vesado.'"[15]





[96]



CHAPTER X.

GAMES AND SPORTS


The hacienda was more beautiful than it had
been in the fall, and Fernando was soon busy
as a bee. He had of course to attend school,
but it was a country school, not so strict nor
so large as the city one, and he enjoyed showing
off his superior accomplishments to the
other boys. This the others did not relish,
and there was a grand fight to see which was
the strongest, and when Fernando had whipped
all the boys of his own size, he was happy and
felt that he had not disgraced the name of
Guzman. Manuel did not attend him in the
country, and Fernando much enjoyed doing as
he liked, roaming about, taking his own time
to come home, tramping about the orange
groves, or sailing boats in the brook.

[97]

When school was over and Antonio came
for the promised visit, what merry times
there were! The boys went swimming at all
hours. They ran bareheaded all over the
place, Mazo after them, their constant companion.
Fernando had a few lessons to do
each morning, a master to teach him his
French, music, and drawing,&mdash;for boys of his
class in Spain are accomplished as well as educated,&mdash;but
these were soon over, and then,
stung by the bees, burnt by the sun, wet by
the rain, eating green oranges, doing in fact
what American boys, or boys all over the
world will do if let alone, this was the way in
which the two Spanish boys spent their vacation.

Juanita, meantime, was having a very happy
time. She, too, had a few lessons, and her aya
was giving place to a governess, but she was
still too young to learn much, and the beautiful
out-of-doors was a great lesson-book to her.
Riding Babieca, tagging after the boys, sun-tanned[98]
and rosy, she grew strong and hearty,
and was never so happy as when allowed to go
with her brother and Antonio. Generally they
took very good care of her, and her mother felt
that she was safe with the two boys. Fernando
teased her a good deal, but Antonio was of a
calmer mood, and was always her gentle knight.

All manner of games were played by these
happy children, who, with their little neighbours
of the nearest hacienda, made a merry group.
They were simple-hearted little folk, and the
boys had not reached the state described in the
old Spanish rhyme of the boys of Madrid:


  
    
"They should be romping with us,
For they are only children yet;
But they will not play at anything
Except a cigarette.
No plays will cheer the Prado
In future times, for then
The little boys of seven
Will all be married men."


Fernando, and even the graver Antonio,
entered into all the childish sports with the[99]
rest, and an especial favourite was a play very
much like our "London Bridge is Falling
Down," called the "Gate of Alcala." Two
children are chosen to head the lines, and
called Rose and Pink. They form an arch
with their arms held up and their fingers
locked, and under this the other children pass
headed by the mother. They sing gaily a
little dialogue:






Rose and Pink.&nbsp;
"To the viper of love that hides in the flowers


The only way lies here."

Mother.&nbsp;
"Then here I pass and leave behind


One little daughter dear."

Rose and Pink.&nbsp;
"Shall the first one or the last


Be captive of our chain?"

Mother.&nbsp;
"Oh, the first one runs so lightly,


The last one shall remain."

Chorus.&nbsp;
"Pass on, oho, pass on, aha!


By the Gate of Alcala."


The last child, with squeals of delight, is
caught in the falling arms, and chooses whether
she shall follow Rose or Pink, taking her[100]
place behind the one of her choice. When
all have been chosen, there is a grand tug of
war, the merry party singing, meantime.




Rose and Pink.&nbsp;
"Let the young mind make its choice,
As young minds chance to think;
Now is Rose your leader,
Or go you with the Pink?
Let the young mind make its choice
By laws the young heart knows.
Now is Pink your leader
Or go you with the Rose?"

Chorus.&nbsp;
"Pass on, oho, pass on, aha,
By the Gates of Alcala."




The boys enjoyed playing soldier, and
would whittle toy swords out of sticks, and
form in line, marching and singing:


  
    
"The Catalans are coming,
Marching two by two;
All who hear their drumming,
Tiptoe for a view,
Aye, aye, tiptoe for a view;
Red and yellow banners,
Pennies very few.
[101]Aye, aye, pennies very few.
    
    
"Red and yellow banners
The moon comes out to see;
If moons had better manners
She'd take me on her knee.
Aye, aye, she'd take me on her knee.
She peeps through purple shutters;
Would I were tall as she.
Aye, aye, would I were tall as she.
    
    
"Soldiers need not learn letters
Nor any schooly thing;
But, unless they mind their betters,
In golden chains they swing.
Aye, aye, in golden chains they'll swing.
Or sit in silver fetters,
Presents from the king.
Aye, aye, presents from the king."


The prettiest of all the games is that of the
"Little White Pigeons," which all Andalusian
children love to play. The little companions
form in two rows, and, facing each other,
dance forward and slip beneath the upraised
arms of the opposite side. Thus they pass
under the "Silver Arches" to Sevilla and
Granada:

[102]


  
    
"Little white pigeons are dreaming of Seville,
Sun in the palm-trees, rose and revel.
Lift up the arches, gold as the weather,
Little white pigeons come flying together.
 
    
"Little white pigeons, dream of Granada,
Glistening snows on Sierra Nevada.
Lift up the arches, silver as fountains,
Little white pigeons fly to the mountains."


Our little Spanish cousins play nearly all
the same games that American children play,
only their "Blind Man's Buff" is called "Blind
Hen," and "Pussy Wants a Corner," is called
"Cottage to Rent," and played with the rhyme:


  
    
"Cottage to rent, try the other side,
You see this one is occupied."


Their game of tag is called the "Moon and
the Morning Stars," and is played by one
child being chosen as the Moon and forced
to keep within the shadow. The rest of the
children, being Morning Stars, are safe only
where it is light. If the Moon can catch a
Star in the shadow, the Star must become[103]
a Moon, and as the Stars scamper in and out
of the shadow, all sing:


  
    
"O the Moon and the Morning Stars,
O the Moon and the Morning Stars,
Who dares to tread&mdash;oh
Within the shadow."


"Hide and Seek" the children played, and
"Forfeits," and all manner of other games,
and as the sun nearly always shines in Andalusia,
the summer was one long merry round
of out-of-door fun.





[104]




CHAPTER XI.

A TERTULIA


September found the children at home
again, and Fernando back at school, while
Juanita had a governess for a part of each day,
though she was not expected to learn a great
deal; for the Spaniards think if their girls are
sweet and gentle they need not be very learned.
If a Spanish girl of sixteen knows how to read
and write, simple arithmetic, a little history,
and can dance and embroider well, she is quite
accomplished enough to marry, which is what
most of them intend to do.

Things were going very quietly, when there
came an excitement so great for the children
that they were almost wild. This was the
home-coming, in the latter part of September,[105]
of Pablo, just in from his long summer cruise,
with a fortnight's leave of absence. He came
home to celebrate his coming of age, and
there was to be a tertulia in his honour. The
children were to stay up to the party, and as
it was the first time that they had been permitted
to stay up after eight o'clock, they
were delighted. To them it was the greatest
event in their lives, and they were almost afraid
to breathe all day, for fear the treat would
be cut off. Juanita even stood quite still to
have her curls made, which was generally a
performance attended with agony, and before
the end of which her aya was sure to say,
"Hush, Mambru will certainly get you!"
Mambru is to a little Spanish girl what a bogey
is to an American child, and she will be very
good for fear of Mambru. But the day passed
off pleasantly, and the children were dressed
and sent down to the patio to await the arrival
of the guests.

[106]

The pleasant thing about a Spanish party
is that there is no fuss made, and therefore
everybody enjoys themselves. The hostess
never tires herself out preparing for her guests
so that she cannot be cheerful and agreeable
when they arrive. The hospitality of Spain
is perfect. A Spaniard gives his friends just
what is good enough for himself, and never
thinks of doing more. So there was not a
great brewing and baking on the day of the
party, and flushed, heated faces; but there
were a few simple refreshments, much pleasant
talk and hearty laughter among old and
young. There were about thirty friends of
the family who came in to talk and chat. The
parents came with their daughters, for girls
never go to parties alone in Spain, and old and
young spent the evening together. Some one
played on the piano and the young people
danced, lovely Trinidad del Aguistanado dancing
with Pablo. This Juanita watched with[107]
delight. Trinidad was the loveliest of all the
girls, and she thought, of course, Pablo should
have the prettiest maiden in all the world.
She was as sweet as she was pretty, and said
to the little girl:

"What is thy name, niña?" and when
Juanita answered, sweetly:

"Juanita, to serve God and you," as all
Spanish children are taught to answer, Trinidad
kissed her on both cheeks, and gave her a rose
from her girdle. At this Juanita was delighted,
and Pablo sighed prodigiously. The older
people, too, seemed well pleased with Pablo's
choice, for the girl's family was as good
as theirs, and the two had been friends for
many years.

"Juanita," said Fernando in a whisper, "I
believe that Pablo will bite the iron[16] of the
Señorita Trinidad. Will it not be strange to[108]
think of him beneath her window, singing
of love to his guitar?"

"It will be beautiful," sighed the little girl,
for Spanish children are always interested in
the love affairs of their older brothers and
sisters, and even little girls talk about them.
"How handsome Pablo looks as he talks
with her."

"They are as fair as the lovers of Teruel,"
said old Dolores, who was at the party to take
care of her little charges.

"Tell us about them," said Juanita, eagerly,
for she dearly loved Dolores's quaint stories;
and the aya began:

"In the town of Teruel there lived, many
years ago, a Spanish knight, Don Juan Diego
Martinez de Marcilla, and he loved with all
his heart Doña Isabel de Segura. Alas, unhappily!
for the fathers of the two lovers
were enemies, and would not listen to love
between them.

[109]

"'Thou art but a second son,' said Don
Pedro de Segura, the father of Doña Isabel.
'Moreover, thou hast not a fortune equal to
that of my daughter, who possesses thirty
thousand sueldos in good gold, and is my
sole heiress.'

"'Full well I know that I am in no wise
worthy of thy fair daughter,' said Don Juan,
'and upon her grace have I no claim save that
she loves my unworthy self. But since this is
God's truth, I pray you give me the chance
to prove my devotion, and I will furnish sufficient
fortune to equal hers. I go to the wars
with my lord, King Sancho of Navarre.
Grant me five years in which to gain this
fortune, and give me your promise that for
that length of time you will not force Doña
Isabel to marry another.'

"Doña Isabel was very young, and her
father very fond, and by this he could keep
her with him five long years, and, moreover,[110]
marry her to whom he pleased, for he said to
himself, 'In that time both of them will forget,'
and so he smilingly said:

"'Your words have some reason. Go with
God, and if you return, well and good. My
daughter shall not marry against her will for
five years to this day, but mark me, rash
youth, not one day more shall she wait.'

"Then the lovers bade each other farewell,
and Don Juan rode to the wars. These were
waged against the wicked Moors, and with
knights and squires, the armies of Don Alphonso
of Castile, Don Pedro of Aragon, and
Don Sancho of Navarre fought long and
fiercely until, at the great battle of Las Navas
de Tolosa, the Moor was crushed. Many a
valiant deed was done, and Don Juan was
bravest of them all. He broke through the
chain which guarded the tent of the Moorish
king, and thereby gained great glory and won
for himself the right to wear a chain around[111]
the margin of his shield in honour of the day.
He gained great renown and fortune, but, alas,
he was sorely wounded, and it was more than
five years before he could return to his beloved.
He arrived in Teruel but one short day after
the time was up, and found Doña Isabel
married to another, Don Pedro Fernandez de
Azagra. Despairing, he desired to see his
beloved once more, and climbed to her window
on her wedding-night. Finding her alone and
her husband sleeping, he implored her to give
him one last kiss. She refused, and said,
weeping, 'Alas! you came not and I thought
myself forgotten. I am wedded to this
good man, and to him alone belong my
caresses.'

"At this his heart broke, and crying, 'Farewell,
beloved!' he dropped dead at her feet.

"At that moment her husband awoke, and
she told him straightway the truth, at which
he said, 'Thou hast been cruel and unkind to[112]
this good man, but to me faithful and true, and
I shall but love thee the more!' and he took
the body of the poor Don Juan and bore it
secretly to his father's step and laid it down
and fled away.

"When the body of the knight was found,
there was great mourning, and he was given
a grand funeral at the cathedral, to which all
Teruel came to do him honour. There also
came the unhappy Doña Isabel, disguised so
that none might know her, and, determined to
give her lover in death the kiss which she had
denied him in life, she stooped to kiss his lips.
Lo! the eyes unclosed, he smiled at her, and
they closed again, and she fell beside him
dead! All were struck dumb with horror, but
Don Azagra came forward and told the mournful
story, whereupon the two bodies were
buried in the same grave.

"'Separated in life, in death they shall be
together,' said the generous knight who had[113]
been her husband but not her beloved; and this
is the sad, sad story of the lovers of Teruel."

"Oh, thank you, Dolores, it is a beautiful
story," cried Juanita, and the young people
who had gathered around to hear clapped
their hands, and thanked her, too.

"What think you, Señorita Trinidad, would
you have kissed your lover had you been Doña
Isabel?" asked Pablo of the young girl.

"I should not have married the other man,
señor," she said, flushing prettily.

"Come, Trinidad, you must sing for us,"
cried one of her friends. "Sing the song of
Santa Rita," and Trinidad, with a merry little
glance at Pablo, sang the gay little song which
Spanish girls sing in jest, asking Santa Rita to
procure them a good husband.


  
    
"Santa Rita, Santa Rita,
Cada una de nosotros necesita,
Para uso de diario
[114]Un marido milionario,
Anunque sea un animal
Si tal, si tal, si tal, si tal,
Un marido milionario,
Anunque sea un animal."[17]


Everybody applauded loudly, and Trinidad,
laughing and blushing, sang again. The older
people sat about serenely, some talking, others
playing cards or dominoes. The younger
ones played sprightly games and talked like
magpies, and the children listened spellbound.

"Who art thou, Pablo?" laughed one, and
Pablo answered, merrily:


  
    
"Ole Saltero, sin vanidad,
Soy muy bonito, soy muy sala!"[18]


[115]
And every one laughed, and Trinidad gave him
a charming glance from under her black lashes.

Refreshments were passed around, very
simple ones. There were trays of water, and
by each glass round lumps of sugar, which
the guests dipped in the water and ate, hard
little cakes, cups of thick chocolate into which
finger cakes were dipped and eaten, and some
charming little bonbons. There was no wine,
for although the finest wine in the world is
made in Spain, the Spaniards are great water
drinkers, and seldom have wine except at dinners.
The men all smoked, but not the ladies,
for while the Mexican women sometimes smoke
a dainty cigarrillo, Spanish women do not.

Later on, Pablo's health was drunk in tiny
glasses of sherry, as this was a special occasion,
and pleasant speeches were made to him,
wishing him all success in his career.

"Thou art now a man, my son," said his
father, proudly and affectionately. "Remember[116]
that since the time of the Emperor
Charles V., thy fathers have had the right
to wear the Golden Key[19] upon their hip, and
do nothing to disgrace thy name. On the
sword of my grandfather was engraved the
motto, 'Do not draw me without reason nor
sheathe me without honour!' Let his motto
be thine own, and remember that to a Spaniard
honour comes first."

Then the party broke up, and Fernando
and Juanita were trotted off to bed, and sleepily
murmured their evening prayer:


  
    
"Jesus, Joseph, Mary,
Your little servant keep,
And with your kind permission,
I'll lay me down to sleep!"


and they heard through the soft moonlight the
tinkle of Pablo's guitar, as he strolled along
to bite the iron beneath the grating of the
dainty Señorita Trinidad.




[117]



CHAPTER XII.

VIVA EL REY!


All Granada was in a flutter! It was the
brightest of October days, and the sun seemed
to be trying to be as bright as the people,
or the people to be as gay as the sunshine.
Fernando and Juanita hopped out of bed and
ran to the window the first minute they were
awake, and squealed with delight when they
saw that the day was fair.

"Oh, mamma!" cried Fernando. "Is it
not glorious? The fête will be a success!"
and Juanita echoed her brother, "Is it not
wonderfully fair!"

"Come and have your chocolate quickly,
like good children," returned their mother,
"for you must be ready early."

[118]

As soon as the children were breakfasted,
they were dressed in their best clothes, Juanita
all in white, with a gay sash, and Fernando in
a sailor suit of blue, and they waited impatiently
for their parents to be ready to start
for the fête.

It was a great day for Granada, for the
king was coming to visit the city, and it had
been many years since royalty had honoured
the Andalusian town. Spaniards are nearly
always devoted to their king, and in Andalusia
there are very few who are not fond and
proud of the young King Alphonso.

In Northern Spain there are many who are
called Carlists, and who believe that the descendants
of Don Carlos are the lawful kings
of Spain, and these have often gotten up revolutions
and tried to set their own favourites up
as kings.

In Barcelona and some of the eastern
provinces there are many who like neither[119]
King Alphonso nor Don Carlos, and these are
anarchists; but Granada was heart and soul
for the king, and all the people were overjoyed
at his coming.

Every balcony in the city was covered with
flowers; flags and banners floated everywhere.
The Alameda was ablaze with decorations, and
every face wore a smile of welcome. The programme
for the day was a simple one. The
king was to be met at the station by a delegation,
a band, and a mounted escort, witness
a military review on the Alameda, and depart
by an afternoon train. All Granada must see
him, and Fernando and Juanita with it.

It had been decided that the best time for
the children to have a good look at the
king was when he drove to the Alhambra,
and Manuel and Dolores started early to take
them to meet Antonio, who had promised to
provide places within the Alhambra grounds,
where the general multitude would be less[120]
likely to go, and where the children would
have a finer view. Pablo went with them, for
he was still at home, and he walked beside
Babieca to see that Juanita did not fall off, on
her long ride up-hill.

"See there, little sister," he said. "Is
not that an easy way to get milk for the
day?"

The goatherd was passing at the head of his
procession of goats, looking neither to the
right nor to the left, expecting his herd to
follow him as gravely as he walked; but a
peasant woman stole out of her door, and
quietly milked one of the little beasts, who
seemed not to object in the least, and took
it so calmly that Pablo added, "That is not the
first time there has been stolen milk for breakfast,
I'm sure."

"See the poor beggar; do give him something,
Pablo," said Juanita, touched by a
wretched specimen of humanity who sat with[121]
blind eyes peering up at them as they passed.
Pablo threw a perro chico into the beggar's
outstretched hand, but he said:

"You must not be too sad for all the
beggars, niña; there is an old rhyme:


  
    
"'The armless man has written a letter,
The blind man finds the writing clear;
The mute is reading it aloud,
And the deaf man runs to hear.'


They are not all so sad as they look, but
one must give for fear one may slight the
really needy."

"Oh, Pablo, may we have some horchata?"
cried Fernando, and his brother stopped to
purchase some of the snowy, chilly, puckery
stuff, and they enjoyed it greatly. Fernando
ate too hastily, and his brother said:

"Quita, quita! You must not act so!
You are as bad as the king when he was a
baby and put his knife in his mouth. His
governess said to him, 'Kings do not eat[122]
with their knives,' and he haughtily replied,
'This king does!'"

"Indeed," said Fernando, pertly, "the king
is my cousin, so it says in my history book
that all Spaniards may say."

"He is your cousin, that is, you must love
him as your own blood; but say, rather, 'All
equal below the king,' and put him ever first.
Remember that your fathers have died for the
Kings of Spain, and we may have a chance
to show our loyalty yet," and Pablo's bright
face clouded a moment.

"Listen to the music; there goes the military
salute! The king has come, and by the time
we reach the Alhambra he will be on his way
hither. Get up, Babieca," and he hurried the
little donkey along until they reached the top
of the hill and found Antonio waiting for
them, his face flushed and eager.

"He will pass here," he cried, "beneath the
Gate of Justice, and my father says we may[123]
stand just behind the guard upon the wall;
there could not be a better place."

"How nice that will be!" cried Juanita.
"And where is Pepita?"

"There, awaiting you," Antonio answered.
"I will take care of Babieca and return," and
he led the donkey away, coming back in
a few moments, and they all waited impatiently.

Spaniards all love a spectacle, and the young
folk could hardly restrain themselves as they
heard the strains of music coming nearer and
nearer. At last the cavalcade came in sight,&mdash;first
a troop of soldiers, then a band playing
the Marcha Real, then a mounted guard keeping
close to His Majesty's carriage. There he
sat, the young king, a tall, slight youth, with a
pale, proud face and great black eyes, sad, yet
merry and tender; a patrician face in every
feature, yet a lovable one, and one to arouse
all of love and loyalty in his subjects, as the[124]
character of Alphonso XIII. arouses their
respect and affection.

As the carriage paused at the entrance gate,
the king looked up at the eager little group
upon the wall and smiled. Juanita and Pepita
flung into his carriage their huge bouquets
of flowers and to the girls he threw a kiss; but
Fernando and Antonio stood up very straight
and saluted gravely, and with a smile in his
eyes, but with grave lips, the young king raised
his hand to his hat and gave them in return
the military salute. Then his carriage passed
on, and bore him out of sight, but a shout
went up from every voice, "Viva el rey!"

"When I grow up I shall be a nun and
pray all the time for the king!" said Pepita.

"I shall be a soldier and fight for him,"
said Fernando, proudly.

"And I," said Juanita, "shall marry and
have many children to fight and pray for him
and for Spain!"

[125]

"Indeed, little sister, perhaps thou hast
chosen the better part," said Pablo, laughing
heartily.

"See!" cried Antonio, "there goes the carriage
again, and hear how the people shout!"
and as the bravas rent the air, the children
shouted, too:

"Viva Espagna! Viva el rey! Dios guarda
usted!"[20]



THE END.

The Little Colonel. (Trade Mark.)

The scene of this story is laid in Kentucky. Its heroine
is a small girl, who is known as the Little Colonel, on
account of her fancied resemblance to an old-school Southern
gentleman, whose fine estate and old family are famous
in the region.


The Giant Scissors.

This is the story of Joyce and of her adventures in
France. Joyce is a great friend of the Little Colonel, and
in later volumes shares with her the delightful experiences
of the "House Party" and the "Holidays."


Two Little Knights of Kentucky.

Who Were the Little Colonel's Neighbors.

In this volume the Little Colonel returns to us like an
old friend, but with added grace and charm. She is not,
however, the central figure of the story, that place being
taken by the "two little knights."


Mildred's Inheritance.

A delightful little story of a lonely English girl who
comes to America and is befriended by a sympathetic
American family who are attracted by her beautiful speaking
voice. By means of this one gift she is enabled to
help a school-girl who has temporarily lost the use of her
eyes, and thus finally her life becomes a busy, happy one.

[A-4]


Cicely and Other Stories for Girls.

The readers of Mrs. Johnston's charming juveniles will
be glad to learn of the issue of this volume for young
people.


Aunt 'Liza's Hero and Other Stories.

A collection of six bright little stories, which will appeal
to all boys and most girls.


Big Brother.

A story of two boys. The devotion and care of Steven,
himself a small boy, for his baby brother, is the theme of
the simple tale.


Ole Mammy's Torment.

"Ole Mammy's Torment" has been fitly called "a classic
of Southern life." It relates the haps and mishaps of a
small negro lad, and tells how he was led by love and kindness
to a knowledge of the right.


The Story of Dago.

In this story Mrs. Johnston relates the story of Dago, a
pet monkey, owned jointly by two brothers. Dago tells
his own story, and the account of his haps and mishaps is
both interesting and amusing.


The Quilt That Jack Built.

A pleasant little story of a boy's labor of love, and how
it changed the course of his life many years after it was
accomplished.


Flip's Islands of Providence.

A story of a boy's life battle, his early defeat, and his
final triumph, well worth the reading.

[A-5]


By EDITH ROBINSON


A Little Puritan's First Christmas.

A story of Colonial times in Boston, telling how Christmas
was invented by Betty Sewall, a typical child of the
Puritans, aided by her brother Sam.


A Little Daughter of Liberty.

The author's motive for this story is well indicated by a
quotation from her introduction, as follows:

"One ride is memorable in the early history of the
American Revolution, the well-known ride of Paul Revere.
Equally deserving of commendation is another ride,&mdash;the
ride of Anthony Severn,&mdash;which was no less historic in its
action or memorable in its consequences."


A Loyal Little Maid.

A delightful and interesting story of Revolutionary days,
in which the child heroine, Betsey Schuyler, renders important
services to George Washington.


A Little Puritan Rebel.

This is an historical tale of a real girl, during the time
when the gallant Sir Harry Vane was governor of Massachusetts.


A Little Puritan Pioneer.

The scene of this story is laid in the Puritan settlement at
Charlestown. The little girl heroine adds another to the
list of favorites so well known to the young people.


A Little Puritan Bound Girl.

A story of Boston in Puritan days, which is of great
interest to youthful readers.


A Little Puritan Cavalier.

The story of a "Little Puritan Cavalier" who tried with
all his boyish enthusiasm to emulate the spirit and ideals of
the dead Crusaders.

man's best friends.

of Betty herself.

Curious little sketches describing the early lifetime, or
"childhood," of the little creatures out-of-doors.

wonderful never-to-be forgotten Christmas that came to
them is the climax of a series of exciting incidents.

Page xi, "bodiess wayed" changed to "bodies swayed" (bodies swayed
to and fro)

Page 86, "mada" changed to "nada" (ha vista nada)

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
