<p style="text-indent: 0">
<span class="smcap">When</span> the first portion of the Memoirs of the late Mr.
Charles Greville, consisting of a Journal of the Reigns of
King George IV. and King William IV., was given to
the world in the autumn of the year 1874, it was intimated
that the continuation of the work was reserved
for future publication. Those volumes included the
record of events which Mr. Greville had noted in his
Diary from the year 1818 to the accession of Her
Majesty Queen Victoria in the year 1837, a period of
nineteen years. As they were published in 1874, an
interval of thirty-seven years had elapsed between
the latest event recorded in them and the date at
which they appeared. The reigns of George IV. and
William IV. already belonged to the history of the
past, and accordingly I did not conceive it to be my
duty to suppress or qualify any of the statements or
opinions of the Author on public men or public events.
I am still of opinion that this was the right course
for a person charged with the publication of these
manuscripts to pursue. I have seen it stated that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
first edition of these Journals contains passages which
have been suppressed in the later editions: but this
is an error. The first edition contained a good many
mistakes, which were subsequently pointed out by
criticism, or discovered and corrected. Two or three
sentences relating to private individuals were omitted,
but nothing which concerns public personages or public
events has been withdrawn.</p>

<p>Eight and forty years have now elapsed since the
date at which the narrative contained in the former
volumes was suspended, and I am led by several considerations
to the opinion that the time has arrived
when it may be resumed. We are divided by a long
interval from the administrations of Lord Melbourne,
Sir Robert Peel, and Lord John Russell, and, with a
very small number of exceptions, no one survives who
sat in the Cabinets of those statesmen. Nearly half a
century has elapsed since the occurrence of the events
recorded in the earlier pages of these volumes, and in a
few months from the publication of them, the nation
and the empire may celebrate with just enthusiasm the
jubilee of the reign of Queen Victoria. Those who
have had the good fortune to witness this long series of
events, and to take any part in them, may well desire
to leave behind them some record of a period, unexampled
in the annals of Great Britain and of the
world for an almost unbroken continuance of progress,
prosperity, liberty, and peace. It is not too
soon to glean in the records of the time those fugitive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
impressions which will one day be the materials of
history. To us, veterans of the century, life is in the
past, and we look back with unfading interest on the
generations that have passed away.</p>

<p>As far as I am myself concerned, I am desirous
to complete, whilst I am able, the task allotted to
me by Mr. Greville in his last hours, which indeed I
regard as a sacred duty, since I know that in placing
these Journals in my hands his principal motive and
intention was that they should not be withheld from
publication until the present interest in them had expired.
The advance of years reminds me that if this
duty is to be performed at all by me, it must not be
indefinitely delayed, and if any strictures are passed on
the Editor of these volumes, I prefer to encounter them
in my own person rather than to leave the work in
other hands and to the uncertainty of the future.</p>

<p>If I turn to precedent and the example of other
writers, it will be found that the interval of time which
has elapsed since the latest date included in these
volumes, embracing the period from 1837 to 1852, is
considerably greater than that which marked the publication
of similar contributions to political
history<a name="FNA_00_01" id="FNA_00_01"></a><a href="#FN_00_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
At the head of these must be placed Bishop Burnet&rsquo;s
&lsquo;History of His Own Time.&rsquo; Bishop Burnet had lived
in confidential relations with four Sovereigns and their
Ministers, and it would be a mistake to compare the
position of Mr. Greville (who never filled any office
of a political nature, and who never lived in confidential
intercourse with the Court) with that of the
bold adviser of Charles II. and James II., and the
trusted councillor of William and Mary. Bishop
Burnet finished his history of the reigns of Charles II.
and James II. about the year 1704; that of William
and Queen Anne between 1710 and 1713. In 1714 he
died. The first folio containing the earlier reigns was
published by his son in 1724; the second in 1734,
barely twenty years after the death of Queen Anne.
Many passages were, however, suppressed, and the text
was not restored in its integrity until the publication of
the Oxford edition in the present century.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_00_01" id="FN_00_01"></a><a href="#FNA_00_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
To look back as far as the Memoirs of the fifteenth century, it may
be noted that the first edition of the Memoirs of Philippe de Comines,
who had lived in the confidential intimacy of King Louis XI. and King
Charles VIII. of France, was published in Paris in 1524, under a special
privilege obtained for that purpose. Louis XI. died in 1483, and his son
Charles VIII. in 1498. Comines himself died in 1511. These Memoirs,
therefore, were published at a time when many of the persons mentioned in
them, and most of their immediate descendants, were still alive.</p></div>

<p>Lord Clarendon died in 1674, and the first edition
of his &lsquo;History of the Rebellion and the Civil Wars&rsquo;
was published in 1702-4, with some alterations and
omissions, which were supplied by the publication of
the complete text in 1826.</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield died in 1773, and his &lsquo;Letters to
his Son,&rsquo; a work abounding in keen and sarcastic observations
on his contemporaries, were published in the
following year, 1774.</p>

<p>Sir Nathaniel Wraxall&rsquo;s &lsquo;Memoirs,&rsquo; which contain
the best account extant of the debates at the time of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
the Coalition Ministry in 1783, and on the Regency
Question in 1788, were published in 1815, about thirty
years after those discussions.</p>

<p>But it is scarcely necessary to seek for remote precedents
to justify the publication of the materials of
contemporary history. Our own time has been fertile
in great examples of it. For instance, the &lsquo;Memoirs
of Lord Palmerston,&rsquo; by Lord Dalling and Mr. Evelyn
Ashley, are full of confidential correspondence on the
secret discussions and resolutions of the Cabinet. The
&lsquo;Journal of Lord Ellenborough,&rsquo; recently published
by Lord Colchester, contains the private record of a
Cabinet Minister on the events of the day and the
characters of his colleagues. The more recent publication
of Lord Malmesbury&rsquo;s &lsquo;Autobiography,&rsquo; and of
the Croker Papers, has made public a large amount
of correspondence and information of great interest,
with reference to the ministerial combinations and
political transactions of the present century. And
above all, Her Majesty Queen Victoria, by placing the
papers of the late Prince Consort, and her own correspondence
and journals, in the hands of Sir Theodore
Martin, for the purpose of composing from the most
authentic materials a full biography of that illustrious
Prince, has shown that, far from regarding with distrust
or repugnance the records of contemporary history,
she has been graciously pleased to contribute to it in
the most ample manner by the publication of an immense
mass of documents relating to the interior of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
the Court, the intercourse of the Sovereign with her
Ministers, the character of foreign monarchs, the less
known transactions of her reign, and even the domestic
incidents of her life. No Sovereign ever courted more
fully and more willingly the light of publicity on a
reign which needs no concealment or disguise.</p>

<p>It would be presumptuous to compare the Journals
of an individual who never held any important office
in the State, and who derived his knowledge of public
affairs entirely from the intercourse of private friendship,
with the correspondence and private records of
sovereigns, ministers, and statesmen of the highest
rank, which have been published with their sanction
or with that of their immediate successors. These
Journals advance no such pretension; but the production
of so many confidential documents of contemporary
or recent history by such personages may be
fairly invoked to justify, <i>à fortiori</i>, the publication of
notes and memoranda of a humbler character.</p>

<p>The incidents and opinions which will be found in
these volumes derive their chief value from the fact
that they are recorded by a bystander and spectator,
who was not, and did not aspire to be, an actor in the
occurrences he witnessed, but who lived on terms of
intimacy with many of the most active politicians of his
times, in both the leading parties in the State, although
he strictly belonged to neither of them, and was wholly
indifferent to mere party interests.</p>

<p>Mr. Greville himself, in communicating a portion of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
his manuscripts to one of his friends, wrote of them in
the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0;">
You will find the greater part
political, not often narrative; mostly allusions and
comments on passing events, the details of which were
not notorious and accessible; some miscellanea of a
different description, personal, social, official; you will
find public characters freely, flippantly perhaps, and
frequently very severely dealt with; in some cases
you will be surprised to see my opinions of certain
men, some of whom, in many respects, I may perhaps
think differently of now. Gibbon said of certain
Pagan philosophers, that &lsquo;their lives were spent in
the pursuit of truth and the practice of virtue.&rsquo; I
cannot boast of having passed my life in the practice
of virtue, but I may venture to say that I have
always pursued truth; and you will see evidence of
the efforts I have made to get at it, and to sum up
conflicting statements of facts with a sort of judicial
impartiality.</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-indent: 0;">
But although I am of opinion that the time has
arrived when a further portion of these Journals may
without impropriety be published, yet I am sensible
that as the narrative draws nearer to the present time,
and touches events occurring during the reign of the
Sovereign who still happily occupies the throne, much
more reticence is required of an Editor than he felt in
speaking of the two last reigns, which belong altogether
to past history. There were in the records of those
reigns topics of scandal and topics of ridicule, already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
familiar to the world, which cast a shadow over those
pages, and the more so as they were true. In narrating
the earlier passages of the reign of Queen Victoria, no
such incidents occur. The Court was pure; the persons
of the Sovereign and her Consort profoundly respected.
The monarchy itself has been strengthened in the last
forty-eight years by a strict adherence to the principles
of moral dignity and constitutional government.
Nothing is to be found in any part of these Journals to
impugn that salutary impression; and they will afford
to future generations no unworthy picture of those
who have played the most conspicuous part in the
last half century.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the delicacy and caution which ought
to be observed in recording the language and the
actions of eminent persons, some of whom are still
alive, appear to me to prescribe the omission, at the
present time, of some passages that may more fitly
be published hereafter. Accordingly, I have exercised
to some extent the discretionary powers entrusted
to me by the Author with these manuscripts; and
I have withheld from publication details which appeared
to be of a strictly confidential character, or
which related the conversations of living persons. In
this respect I have again followed the example set by
the illustrious precedents to which I have already
referred. Lord Clarendon&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of the Great Rebellion,&rsquo;
Bishop Burnet&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of His Own Time,&rsquo;
the Duc de Saint-Simon&rsquo;s &lsquo;Memoirs,&rsquo; were all first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
published with large omissions from the text; and it
is only in our own age&mdash;one or two centuries after
the death of the writers&mdash;that these works have been
made known to the world in their integrity from the
original manuscripts. I know not if these Journals are
destined to so long a life; they certainly do not lay
claim to so great and lasting an historical and literary
fame; but it is probable they will be read and referred
to hereafter as a portion of the materials of history of
England in this century.</p>

<p>The alternative lay between the entire suppression
of the work for an indefinite period, and the publication
of by far the larger portion of it with the omission
of a few passages which touched too nearly on our
contemporaries. Upon the whole, the latter course
appears to me the most consistent with the duty I
accepted from the Author, and which I owe to the
public. It must not be supposed, however, that the
passages which are omitted in this edition contain
anything which it would be thought discreditable for
the Author to have written or for the Editor to publish,
or that they are of considerable extent or importance.
These passages are simply withheld at the present time
from motives of delicacy to persons still alive, or to
their immediate descendants. I adhere to the opinion
previously expressed by me, that the public conduct of
those who, by their station or their offices must be
regarded as public characters, needs no reticence or
concealment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
An observation occurs in one of the later volumes
of these Journals (which had previously escaped my
notice) in which the Author remarks that much that
he has written appears to him to be extremely dull,
and that to avoid dullness the manuscript should be
carefully revised before it is made public. I have
not the same dread of dullness which affected Mr.
Greville. A passage may be found to contain something
of interest hereafter, though it is not amusing,
and at the worst the reader can pass it by. Nor
do I attach importance to the amusement the public
may derive from this work. The volumes now published
may be less attractive to some readers than
those which preceded them, for they relate to less
dissipated and distracted times; but they are, I think,
more instructive because they are marked by a deeper
insight into political history.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I may remark that the present publication
embraces a period of fourteen years, extending
from the accession of Her Majesty Queen Victoria
in 1837 to the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of Napoleon III. in 1851.
The latest events recorded in these pages are separated
from us by an interval of about thirty-four years.
The occurrences which took place after the close of
1851, the subsequent establishment of the Imperial
power in France, the formation of the Cabinet of Lord
Aberdeen, followed in 1853 by the Crimean War, mark
an important epoch in the history of this country and
of Europe. I have therefore thought that this date is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
the appropriate conclusion of this portion of the work.
Mr. Greville continued his Journal for nine years more,
until the close of 1860, though in his later years he was
less conversant with public affairs than he had been
in the more active period of his life. Should life and
health be vouchsafed to me, I shall endeavour to complete
the task he confided to my care by the publication
of one or two concluding volumes at no distant
period.</p>

<h3>June 25th, 1837</h3>

<p>I remember when George IV. died,
seven years ago, having been struck by the small apparent
sensation that his death created. There was, however, at
that time a great deal of bustle and considerable excitement,
which were caused by the activity of the new Court, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
eccentricities of the King; but in the present instance the
Crown has been transferred to the head of the new Queen
with a tranquillity which is curious and edifying. The first
interest and curiosity to see the young Queen and observe
her behaviour having passed off, there appears nothing more
to do or to think about; there are no changes, and there is
no talk of change. Her Majesty has continued quietly at
Kensington, where she transacts business with her Ministers,
and everything goes on as if she had been on the throne six
years instead of six days. Animated panegyrics were pronounced
upon the late King in both Houses of Parliament
by those who had served him; and Peel repeated in the
House of Commons, in more set phrases, the expressions of
his admiration of the conduct of the Queen on her first
public appearance, which he uttered to me when I saw him
after the Council on Tuesday. Melbourne&rsquo;s funeral oration
over William IV. was very effective because it was natural
and hearty, and as warm as it could be without being
exaggerated. He made the most of the virtues the King
undoubtedly possessed, and passed lightly over his defects.</p>

<p>King William IV., if he had been born in a private
station, would have passed unobserved through life like
millions of other men, looked upon as possessing a good-natured
and affectionate disposition, but without either
elevation of mind or brightness of intellect. During many
years of his life the Duke of Clarence was an obscure individual,
without consideration, moving in a limited circle,
and altogether forgotten by the great world. He resided
at Bushey with Mrs. Jordan, and brought up his numerous
children with very tender affection: with them, and for
them, he seemed entirely to live. The cause of his separation
from Mrs. Jordan has not been explained, but it
probably arose from his desire to better his condition by a
good marriage, and he wanted to marry Miss Wykeham, a
half-crazy woman of large fortune, on whom he afterwards
conferred a Peerage. George IV., I believe, put a spoke in
that wheel, fortunately for the Duke as well as for the
country. The death of the Princess Charlotte opened to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CHARACTER OF WILLIAM IV.</span>
him a new prospect, and the lack of royal progeny made his
marriage as desirable an event to the public as it was convenient
to himself. The subsequent death of the Duke of
York, which made him heir to the throne, at once exalted
him into a personage of political importance, and when the
great Tory schism took place, upon the death of Lord
Liverpool, Mr. Canning thought the Duke of Clarence&rsquo;s
appointment to the office of Lord High Admiral would
strengthen his Government, and at the same time relieve
him from some of the difficulties which beset him; and he
accordingly prevailed upon the King to revive the office in
his person. Soon after the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s elevation
he found it necessary to remove the Duke of Clarence, and
it is an excellent trait in the character of the latter that,
notwithstanding his vexation at the time, which was very
great, he harboured no resentment against the Duke of
Wellington, and never seems to have hesitated about retaining
him as his Minister when he came to the throne. His
exaltation (for the moment) completely turned his head, but
as his situation got familiar to him he became more composed
and rational, if not more dignified in his behaviour.
The moral and intellectual qualities of the King, however
insignificant in themselves, now became, from their unavoidable
influence, an object of great interest and importance,
and in the early part of his reign he acquired no small share
of popularity. People liked a King whose habits presented
such a striking contrast to those of his predecessor. His
attention to business, his frank and good-humoured familiarity,
and his general hospitality, were advantageously compared
with the luxurious and selfish indolence and habits
of seclusion in the society of dull and grasping favourites
which characterised the former reign.</p>

<p>The King seemed to be more occupied with the pleasing
novelty of his situation, providing for his children, and
actively discharging the duties of his high function, than in
giving effect to any political opinions; and he took a correct
view of his constitutional obligations, for although he continued
his confidence to the Duke of Wellington unabated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to the last, he transferred it as entirely to Lord Grey when
the Whigs came in. He went on with his second Ministry
as cordially as he had done with his first, nor does it appear
that he took fright at their extensive plans of reform when
they were first promulgated. He was probably bit by the
popularity which the Reform Bill procured him, and it was
not until he had gone too far to recede with safety that he
was roused from his state of measureless content and unthinking
security. The roar of the mighty conflict which
the Reform Bill brought on filled him with dismay, and very
soon with detestation of the principles of which he had
unwittingly permitted himself to be the professor and the
promoter; and as these feelings and apprehensions were
continually stimulated by almost all the members of his
family, legitimate and illegitimate, they led him into those
unavailing struggles which embroiled him with his Ministers,
rendered him obnoxious to the Liberal party, compromised
the dignity of the Crown and the tranquillity of the country,
and grievously embittered the latter years of his life. But
although King William was sometimes weak, sometimes
obstinate, and miserably deficient in penetration and judgement,
he was manly, sincere, honest, and straightforward.
The most painful moment of his life, and the greatest
humiliation to which a king ever submitted, must have
been when he again received the Whig Ministers in 1835;
but it is to the credit of Lord Melbourne, as well as of the
King, that their subsequent personal intercourse was not
disagreeable to either, and greatly to the King&rsquo;s honour that
he has never been accused or suspected of any underhand
or indirect proceeding for the purpose of emancipating himself
from a thraldom so galling. Of political dexterity and
artifice he was altogether incapable, and although, if he had
been false, able, and artful, he might have caused more
perplexity to his Whig Government and have played a better
party game, it is perhaps fortunate for the country, and
certainly happy for his own reputation, that his virtues thus
predominated over his talents. The most remarkable foible
of the late King was his passion for speechifying, and I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">POLITICAL EFFECTS OF THE KING&rsquo;S DEATH.</span>
have recorded some of his curious exhibitions in this way.
He had considerable facility in expressing himself, but what
he said was generally useless or improper. He never received
the homage of a Bishop without giving him a lecture;
and the custom he introduced of giving toasts and making
speeches at all his dinners was more suitable to a tavern than
to a palace. He was totally deficient in dignity or refinement,
and neither his elevation to the throne nor his association
with people of the most distinguished manners could
give him any tincture of the one or the other. Though a
good-natured and amiable man, he was passionate and hasty,
and thus he was led into those bickerings and quarrels with
the Duchess of Kent and with his own children, which were
a perpetual source of discomfort or disgrace to him, and all
of which might have been avoided by a more consistent
course of firmness and temper on his part. His sons generally
behaved to him with great insolence and ingratitude,
except Adolphus. Of the daughters I know nothing.</p>

<p>The various political hopes, fears, and expectations which
his death has raised may be very shortly summed up. Nobody
can deny that it has given the Whig Government a
great advantage over the Tories. Hitherto the Government
have been working against the stream, inasmuch as they
had the influence of the Crown running dead against them;
the tide has now turned in their favour, and to a certain
degree they will be able to convert the Tory principle to
their own advantage. The object of the Whigs is to remain
in office, to put down the Radicals and Radicalism, and go
on gradually and safely reforming; above all to proceed
as fast as the innumerable difficulties which impede their
course will let them, in bringing Ireland into a state of quiet
and contentment, and to pave the way for some definite
settlement of the great questions which distract that country.
This I believe to be the object of Lord Melbourne and Lord
John Russell, but at the same time they have colleagues
and supporters who have more extensive and less moderate
views, and who would like to see the Government more
cordially allied to the Radicals than it is, and who are so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
animated against the Tories that they would do <i>anything</i> to
prevent their return to
power.<a name="FNA_01_01" id="FNA_01_01"></a><a href="#FN_01_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

[A list of Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s second Administration will be found in the
first part of this work, vol. iii. p. 256. It had undergone no change since
1835, except that the Great Seal, which had been put in commission, was
now held by Lord Cottenham.]</p></div>

<p>The great body of the Tories, on the other hand, are
thirsting for office: they are, or pretend to be, greatly
alarmed at the Radical tendencies of the Government, but
they are well aware that in the actual state of the House of
Commons they have the power of keeping the Government
in check and of defeating every Radical scheme while <i>in
opposition</i>, but that it would be dangerous to attempt to
turn them out and take their places. So far from being
satisfied with this position of exceeding strength and utility,
they are chafing and fuming that they can&rsquo;t get in, and
would encounter all the hazards of defeat for the slightest
chance of victory. It is only the prudent reserve of Peel
(in which Stanley and Graham probably join) that restrains
the impatience of the party within moderate bounds. The
Radicals are few in number, and their influence is very low;
they are angry with the Government for not making greater
concessions to them, but as they still think there is a better
chance of their views being promoted by the Whigs remaining
in, they continue to vote with them in cases of need,
though there are some of them who would prefer the dissolution
of the Ministry and war with a Tory Government
rather than the present imperfect alliance which subsists
between themselves and the Whigs. The Whigs then expect
to gain by the new elections and to obtain an accession
of strength to their Government. They think the popularity
of a new reign, and the partial neutrality of the Tory
principle, will be of material advantage to their cause. The
Tories, though they maintain that they shall not lose at the
elections, evidently feel that they take the field under a
great disadvantage, and do not deny that the King&rsquo;s death
has been a heavy blow to them as a party.</p>

<h3>June 29th, 1837</h3>

<p>All the accounts continue to report well of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD DURHAM.</span>
the young Queen, of her quickness, sense and discretion, and
the remarkable facility with which she has slid into her high
station and discharges its duties. The Duchess of Kent
never appears at Kensington, where the Queen occupies a
separate range of apartments, and her influence is very
silently exercised, if at all. The town is rife with reports of
changes and appointments, some very natural and others
very absurd; all agree that the power vested in Melbourne&rsquo;s
hands is unbounded, and that (as far as Court appointments
are concerned) he uses it with propriety. The great topic of
interest is the question of Lord Hill&rsquo;s
removal,<a name="FNA_01_02" id="FNA_01_02"></a><a href="#FN_01_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
which the
Radicals and violent Whigs have been long driving at, but
to which it is believed Melbourne is himself adverse. So
Lord Stanley told me the other day as his belief; and when
I said that though this might be so, it was doubtful how far
he would be induced to fight the battle in his own Cabinet
if it was mooted there, he said that from what he heard,
he thought Melbourne was lord and master in his own
Cabinet.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_01_02" id="FN_01_02"></a><a href="#FNA_01_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
[Lord Hill held the office of Commander-in-Chief from 1828 till 1842,
when he resigned it.]</p></div>

<p>The eternal question in everybody&rsquo;s mouth is what is
Lord Durham to have, or if it is indispensable that he should
have anything. When Durham left England, he was the
elected chief of the Radicals, and he was paving the way
to future Court favour through a strict alliance with the
Duchess of Kent and Sir John Conroy. At St. Petersburg
his language was always moderate; now that he is returned,
the Radicals, still regarding him as their chief, look anxiously
to his introduction into the Cabinet. Charles Buller, whom I
met the other day, said, in reply to my asking him if Government
would gain at the elections, &lsquo;I think they will gain
anyhow, but <i>if they are wise</i> they will gain largely.&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;I wonder what you call being wise?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Take in
Lord Durham.&rsquo; But they want Durham to be taken in as a
pledge of the disposition of the Government to adopt their
principles,<a name="FNA_01_03" id="FNA_01_03"></a><a href="#FN_01_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
whereas Melbourne will receive him upon no such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
terms; and if Durham takes office, he must subscribe to the
moderate principles upon which both Melbourne and John
Russell seem disposed to act. After all, it appears to me
that a mighty fuss is made about Durham without any
sufficient reason, that his political influence is small, his
power less, and that it is a matter of great indifference
whether he is in office or out.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_01_03" id="FN_01_03"></a><a href="#FNA_01_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
After this was written, a letter of Durham&rsquo;s appeared couched in
vague but conservative language, and without any allusion to the Ballot or
the Radical desiderata.</p></div>

<h3>July 9th, 1837</h3>

<p>Yesterday I went to the late King&rsquo;s funeral,
who was buried with just the same ceremonial as his predecessor
this time seven years. It is a wretched mockery
after all, and if I were king, the first thing I would do should
be to provide for being committed to the earth with more
decency and less pomp. A host of persons of all ranks and
stations were congregated, who &lsquo;loitered through the lofty
halls,&rsquo; chattering and laughing, and with nothing of woe
about them but the garb. I saw two men in an animated
conversation, and one laughing heartily at the very foot of
the coffin as it was lying in state. The chamber of death in
which the body lay, all hung with black and adorned with
scutcheons and every sort of funereal finery, was like a scene
in a play, and as we passed through it and looked at the
scaffolding and rough work behind, it was just like going
behind the scenes of a theatre. A soldier&rsquo;s funeral, which I
met in the morning&mdash;the plain coffin slowly borne along by
his comrades, with the cap and helmet and sword of the
dead placed upon it&mdash;was more impressive, more decent,
more affecting than all this pomp with pasteboard crowns,
and heralds scampering about, while idleness and indifference
were gazing or gossiping round about the royal remains. I
would rather be quietly consigned to the grave by a few who
cared for me (if any such there might be) than be the object
of all this parade and extravagance. The procession moving
slowly through close ranks of Horse and Foot Guards holding
tapers and torches in their hands, whilst at intervals the
bands played a dead march, had, however, a very imposing
effect. The service was intolerably long and tedious, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE ELECTIONS.</span>
miserably read by the Dean of Windsor. The Queen
Dowager, with the King&rsquo;s daughters and her ladies, were in
the Royal Closet, and the FitzClarences in the one adjoining.
At twelve o&rsquo;clock she was to depart for Bushey, and a bitter
moment it must have been when she quitted for ever the
Castle where she had spent seven years of prosperous and
happy splendour.</p>

<p>We continue to hear of the young Queen&rsquo;s admirable
behaviour, but all other subjects are swallowed up in the
interest of the approaching elections. There will be more
contests than ever were known, and it is amusing to see
both parties endeavouring to avail themselves of the Queen&rsquo;s
name, the Tories affecting to consider her as a prisoner in
the hands of the Whigs, and the Whigs boasting of the
cordiality and warmth of her sentiments in their favour.
The Whigs have the best of this, as they have some evidence
to show in support of their assertions, and the probability
really is that she is well enough contented with them, as
they naturally take care she should be. Of the probable
changes, one of the most important is the defeat of Sir
James Graham in Cumberland, an event which the Whigs
hail with extreme satisfaction, for they hate him rancorously.
I am under personal obligations to Graham, and therefore
regret that this feeling exists; but it is not unnatural, and
his political conduct is certainly neither creditable nor consistent.
He is now little better than a Tory, a very high
Churchman, and one of the least liberal of the Conservative
leaders. In Lord Grey&rsquo;s Government he was one of the
most violent, and for going to greater lengths than the
majority of his colleagues. When the Reform Bill was concocted
by a committee consisting of John Russell, Duncannon,
Durham, and Graham, Graham earnestly advocated
the Ballot, and Lord Durham says he has in his possession
many letters of Graham&rsquo;s, in which he presses for a larger
measure of reform than they actually brought forward. In
his address he says he has not changed, and talks of &lsquo;having
belonged to the Whig Government before they had made
the compact by which they are now bound to O&rsquo;Connell.&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Tavistock<a name="FNA_01_04" id="FNA_01_04"></a><a href="#FN_01_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
said to me yesterday that this was too bad, because
he knew very well that the only understanding the Government
had with O&rsquo;Connell was one of mutual support in the
Irish elections, the same which existed when he was in office;
and, moreover, that at that time the majority of the Cabinet
(Graham included) wanted to confer office upon O&rsquo;Connell,
and that they were only induced to forego that design by the
remonstrances of Lord Lansdowne and the Duke of Richmond,
who insisted upon a further probation before they did
so. O&rsquo;Connell got nothing, and soon after took to agitating
and making violent speeches. This exasperated Lord Grey,
who, in his turn, denounced him in the King&rsquo;s Speech, and
hence that feud between O&rsquo;Connell and the Whigs, which
was only terminated by the attempt of the Tories to retake
office in 1835. This led to the imperfect alliance between
them, half denied by the Whigs, which exposed the Government
to as much obloquy as if they had concluded an open
and avowed alliance with him, and perhaps to greater inconvenience.
It was a great blunder not securing O&rsquo;Connell
in the first instance, and certainly a curious thing that such
men as Lord Lansdowne, and still more the Duke of Richmond,
should have influenced so important a matter and
have overborne the opinions of the whole Cabinet. After all
this, it is not extraordinary that his old associates should be
disgusted at seeing Graham become a Tory champion, and at
hearing him more bitter against them than any man on the
Opposition benches. The Tories, on the other hand, rejoice
in him, and his bigotry about all Church matters cancels in
their minds all his former Liberalism in that and every
other respect.</p>

[Francis, Marquis of Tavistock, afterwards seventh Duke of Bedford;
born 12th May 1788, died 14th May 1861. He was one of Mr. Greville&rsquo;s most
intimate friends. They agreed in the main in politics, and had a common
amusement&mdash;the turf. Lord Tavistock preferred a life of retirement, and
he refused office, but he kept up an enormous correspondence with the
leading statesmen of the day. He was consulted by them on all occasions,
and not infrequently by the Queen, and he exercised a considerable, though
inostensible, influence on public affairs.]</p></div>

<h3>Knowsley, July 18th, 1837</h3>

<p>Tired of doing nothing in London,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF A RAILROAD.</span>
and of hearing about the Queen, and the elections, I resolved
to vary the scene and run down here to see the Birmingham
railroad, Liverpool, and Liverpool races. So I started at
five o&rsquo;clock on Sunday evening, got to Birmingham at half-past
five on Monday morning, and got upon the railroad at
half-past seven. Nothing can be more comfortable than the
vehicle in which I was put, a sort of chariot with two places,
and there is nothing disagreeable about it but the occasional
whiffs of stinking air which it is impossible to exclude altogether.
The first sensation is a slight degree of nervousness
and a feeling of being run away with, but a sense of security
soon supervenes, and the velocity is delightful. Town after
town, one park and <i>château</i> after another are left behind
with the rapid variety of a moving panorama, and the
continual bustle and animation of the changes and stoppages
make the journey very entertaining. The train was very
long, and heads were continually popping out of the several
carriages, attracted by well-known voices, and then came the
greetings and exclamations of surprise, the &lsquo;Where are you
going?&rsquo; and &lsquo;How on earth came you here?&rsquo; Considering
the novelty of its establishment, there is very little embarrassment,
and it certainly renders all other travelling irksome
and tedious by comparison. It was peculiarly gay at this
time, because there was so much going on. There were all
sorts of people going to Liverpool races, barristers to the
assizes, and candidates to their several elections. The day
was so wet that I could not see the town of Liverpool.</p>

<p>This is a very large place, the house immense, with no
good room in it but the dining room. The country is generally
flat, but there are fine trees and thriving plantations,
so that it is altogether sufficiently enjoyable. It is a strange
thing to see Stanley here; he is certainly the most natural
character I ever saw; he seems never to think of throwing
a veil over any part of himself; it is this straightforward
energy which makes him so considerable a person as he is.
In London he is one of the great political leaders, and the
second orator in the House of Commons, and here he is a
lively rattling sportsman, apparently devoted to racing and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
rabbit-shooting, gay, boisterous, almost rustic in his manners,
without refinement, and if one did not know what his powers
are and what his position is, it would be next to impossible
to believe that the Stanley of Knowsley could be the Stanley
of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Just before I left London, the Proclamation of the King
of Hanover appeared, by which he threw over the new Constitution.
Lyndhurst told me of it, before I had seen it,
with many expressions of disappointment, and complaining
of his folly and of the bad effect it would produce here. The
Government papers have taken it up, though rather clumsily,
for the purpose of connecting this violent measure with the
Tory party; but it is a great folly in the Opposition, and in
the journals belonging to them, not to reject at once and
peremptorily all connexion with the King of Hanover, and
all participation in, or approbation of, his measures. Lyndhurst
told me that the King had all along protested against
this Constitution, and refused to sign or be a party to it;
that he contended it was illegal, inasmuch as the States by
which it had been enacted had been illegally convoked; that
he was <i>able</i> to do what he has done by his independence in
point of finance, having a great revenue from Crown lands.
The late King was very anxious to give this up, and to have
a Civil List instead; but when this was proposed, the Duke
of Cumberland exerted his influence successfully to defeat
the project, and it was accordingly thrown out in the Senate
(I think the Senate) by a small majority. Though we have
nothing to do with Hanover, this violence will, no doubt,
render him still more odious here than he was before, and it
would be an awful thing if the Crown were, by any accident,
to devolve upon him. The late King&rsquo;s desire to effect this
change affords an indisputable proof of the sincerity of his
constitutional principles, and it is no small praise that he
was satisfied with a constitutional sovereignty, and did not
hanker after despotic power.</p>

<p>I remained at Knowsley till Saturday
morning, when I went to Liverpool, got into the train at
half-past eleven, and at five minutes after four arrived at

<span class="pagehead">RESULT OF THE ELECTIONS.</span>
Birmingham with an exact punctuality which is rendered
easy by the great reserved power of acceleration, the pace at
which we travelled being moderate and not above one half
the speed at which they do occasionally go; one engineer
went at the rate of forty-five miles an hour, but the Company
turned him off for doing so. I went to Kenilworth, and
saw the ruins of Leicester&rsquo;s Castle, and thence to Warwick
to see the Castle there, with both of which I was very much
delighted, and got to town on Sunday to find myself in the
midst of all the interest of the elections, and the sanguine
and confident assertions and expectations of both parties.
The first great trial of strength was in the City yesterday;
and though Grote beat Palmer at last, and after a severe
struggle, by a very small majority, it is so far consolatory to
the Conservative interest that it shows a prodigious change
since the last general election, when the Conservative candidate
was 2,000 behind his opponents.</p>

<h3>July 28th, 1837</h3>

<p>The borough elections in England, as far as
they have gone, and they are nearly over, have disappointed
the Government, who expected to gain in
them.<a name="FNA_01_05" id="FNA_01_05"></a><a href="#FN_01_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The
contests have been numerous, often very close, and in some
instances very costly. Norwich, won with the greatest difficulty
by Lord Douro and Scarlett, is said to have cost
50,000&#8467;. A compromise was offered at Yarmouth and at
Norwich, but the parties could not come to terms, and the
result has been the same as if it had taken place&mdash;two Tories
in one place and two Whigs in the other. There have been a
vast number of changes, and, as always happens, results very
different from what were expected in particular places. The
balance is slightly in favour of the Tories, but the best sign
of the times is the defeat of the Radicals in various places.
Grote nearly beaten in the City, and probably will be turned
out on a scrutiny;<a name="FNA_01_06" id="FNA_01_06"></a><a href="#FN_01_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Roebuck and Palmer were defeated at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Bath, Ewart at Liverpool, Wigney at Brighton, Thompson at
Hull. It was clear enough before from the Conservative
language which was put into the Queen&rsquo;s mouth by her
Ministers, and by that which they held themselves, that it
was the only tone which would be palatable to the country,
and the event of the elections confirms this impression.
This is, after all, the essential point, to which the gains of
either party are entirely subordinate. If the Government
keeps together without internal dissensions, and nothing
particular occurs to produce a change, these Ministers cannot
well be turned out, because, though their majority is small,
they have the undoubted support of the House of Commons,
and in my opinion they will be all the stronger from the
Radicals being so reduced in numbers, as those who remain
must support them, and cannot expect any concessions in
return. It is quite impossible to doubt that there is in the
country a strong Conservative reaction, and it is the more
valuable from not being more strongly pronounced. It is
great enough to prove that our institutions are safe, but not
great enough to bring the Tories back into power and to
turn their heads, ready as they always are to be puffed up
with every returning gale of success. The Tories have made
one good exchange in the article of whippers-in, for they
have got Planta and Holmes instead of Bonham and Ross.</p>

<p>Everything that could be said in praise of the Queen, of
her manners, conduct, conversation, and character, having
been exhausted, we now hear no more of her. It is an
interesting speculation to conjecture how soon she will begin
to think and to act for herself upon higher matters, as she
has at once done on all minor points connected with her
domestic arrangements. It is generally believed that she is
perfectly independent of any influence in these things, and
while in all political concerns she has put herself implicitly
in Melbourne&rsquo;s hands, in all others she is her own mistress.
From the beginning she resolved to have nothing to do with
Sir John Conroy, but to reward him liberally for his services
to her mother. She began by making him a baronet, and
she has given him a pension of 3,000&#8467;. a year; but he has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PRINCESS LIEVEN&rsquo;S AUDIENCES.</span>
never once been invited to the Palace, or distinguished by
the slightest mark of personal favour, so that nothing can
be more striking than the contrast between the magnitude
of the pecuniary bounty and the complete personal disregard
of which he is the object. The Queen has been extremely
kind and civil to the Queen Dowager, but she has taken
no notice of the King&rsquo;s children, good, bad, or indifferent.
Lord Munster asked for an audience to deliver up the keys
of the Castle which he had, and was very graciously received
by her, but she did not give him back the keys. Adolphus
FitzClarence has lost his Lordship of the Bedchamber, but
then they only retained Peers, and he keeps the command
of the Royal yacht. He has had no intimation whether his
pension and his Rangership of Windsor Park are to be continued
to him. [In the end, however, they retained everything,
and the Queen behaved with equal liberality and
kindness towards them all.]</p>

<h3>July 29th, 1837</h3>

<p>The loss of Leeds, news which arrived last
night, is a great blow to the Tories, and the only important
Radical triumph that has occurred. George Byng<a name="FNA_01_07" id="FNA_01_07"></a><a href="#FN_01_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
told me yesterday that all the applications from the country for
candidates sent to the Reform Club desired that Whigs
and not Radicals might be supplied to them, which affords
an additional proof of the decline of Radical opinions. He
owned that they are disappointed at the result of the
borough contests, having lost many places when they had
no idea there was any danger.</p>

<h3>July 30th, 1837</h3>

<p>Madame de Lieven told me yesterday that
she had an audience of the Queen, who was very civil and
gracious, but timid and embarrassed, and talked of nothing
but commonplaces. Her Majesty had probably been told
that the Princess was an <i>intrigante</i>, and was afraid of committing
herself. She had afterwards an interview with the
Duchess of Kent, who (she told me) it was plain to see
is overwhelmed with vexation and disappointment. Her
daughter behaves to her with kindness and attention but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
has rendered herself quite independent of the Duchess, who
painfully feels her own insignificance. The almost contemptuous
way in which Conroy has been dismissed must
be a bitter mortification to her. The Duchess said to
Madame de Lieven, &lsquo;qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y avait plus d&rsquo;avenir pour elle,
qu&rsquo;elle n&rsquo;était plus rien;&rsquo; that for eighteen years this child
had been the sole object of her life, of all her thoughts and
hopes, and now she was taken from her, and there was an
end of all for which she had lived heretofore. Madame de
Lieven said that she ought to be the happiest of human
beings, to see the elevation of this child, her prodigious
success, and the praise and admiration of which she was
universally the object; that it was a triumph and a glory
which ought to be sufficient for her&mdash;to which she only shook
her head with a melancholy smile, and gave her to understand
that all this would not do, and that the accomplishment
of her wishes had only made her to the last degree
unhappy. King William is revenged, he little anticipated
how or by what instrumentality, and if his ghost is an ill-natured
and vindictive shade, it may rejoice in the sight of
this bitter disappointment of his enemy. In the midst of all
her propriety of manner and conduct, the young Queen begins
to exhibit slight signs of a peremptory disposition, and it is
impossible not to suspect that, as she gains confidence, and
as her character begins to develope, she will evince a strong
will of her own. In all trifling matters connected with her
Court and her palace, she already enacts the part of Queen
and mistress as if it had long been familiar to her.</p>

<h3>August 8th, 1837</h3>

<p>At Goodwood since this day week till Saturday,
when I went to Petworth;&mdash;to town yesterday. The
county elections have produced an endless succession of
triumphs to the Conservatives, of which the greatest was
that over Hume in Middlesex. The Whigs are equally
astonished and dismayed at this result, for they had not a
notion of being bowled down as they have been one after
another. If the others had known their own strength, they
might have done a great deal more; Bingham
Baring<a name="FNA_01_08" id="FNA_01_08"></a><a href="#FN_01_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
could

<span class="pagehead">CONSERVATIVE REACTION.</span>
have brought in another man with him for Staffordshire;
Henry Windham could have won Sussex had he chosen it,
and was very near being brought in without his own consent,
and against the wishes of Lord Egremont, who, having
renounced politics, could not endure the idea of his son
being member for the county. Had Lord Egremont lifted
up his finger, Windham would have come in. The most
extraordinary of all these elections is that of Bingham
Baring. He could not stand again with any chance of
success for Winchester, and he went with 5,000&#8467;. in his
pocket to Stafford, from time immemorial a corrupt borough;
there he was beat, and he was about to return after spending
about one half of his cash, when Lord Sandon pressed him to
allow himself to be proposed for Staffordshire, asserting that
nothing was requisite but a candidate, so much stronger was
the Conservative feeling in the county than people were
aware of. Without much hope of success, his family having
never resided in the county, though his father has some
property in it, and being personally unknown to the electors,
he consented to stand, and, though he had no committee, and
nothing was previously organised or arranged, he was carried
by a prodigious majority to the head of the poll. The elections
in which the Conservatives have failed have, nevertheless,
exhibited a vast change in the public mind, for they
have generally been very severe contests, and in Yorkshire,
with nearly twice the constituency that there was at the last
election, John Wortley was within a few hundreds of his
opponents, when on the former occasion he was in a miserable
minority.</p>

<p>Lord Munster has got back his keys of the Round Tower.
Melbourne found out that the place was held for life, and he
sent for Munster, and told him he had been hasty in disposing
of it, that it was his own doing and not the Queen&rsquo;s,
who had acted entirely by his advice, and that in his situation
it was impossible for him to do otherwise than bestow
any vacant appointment upon a person connected with his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
own party, but that he was extremely glad in the present
instance to find that he was not at liberty to deprive Munster
of the office. Munster afterwards saw the Queen, who was
exceedingly gracious, and told him she was very glad to
restore the keys to him. The Queen and Melbourne appear
to have both evinced kindness and good feeling on this
occasion.</p>

<h3>August 25th, 1837</h3>

<p>Nothing of any moment has occurred for
some time past, and all the world has been occupied with the
elections as long as they lasted. After much disputing
between the two parties as to the actual result, it appears by
an impartial examination of the returns that the Ministers
will have a majority of 30, and possibly a little more. As the
Government members always attend better than their opponents,
the working majority will probably be usually greater
than this. The Conservatives are exceedingly triumphant at
the result, and not without reason. The English counties
have made a very important demonstration in their favour;
they have not lost in the towns, and the Radicals have been
almost everywhere defeated. This latter circumstance is
exceedingly satisfactory, but the Radicals themselves do not
admit that this election affords any proof that their principles
are on the decline throughout the country. There cannot,
however, be a doubt that questions of organic change are not
at present in any degree of public favour. Charles Villiers,
one of the Radicals with whom I sometimes converse, insists
upon it that the Ballot has made great progress, but he also
declares that, if carried, it would prove a Conservative
measure, and that better men would be chosen. He predicts,
however, with greater appearance of reason, that the question
of the Corn Laws will, before long, become of paramount
interest and importance, and I am induced to think that the
next great struggle that takes place will be for their repeal.</p>

<p>The Tories behaved exceedingly ill in one respect during
the late contest, and that was in availing themselves as much
as possible of the cry that has been raised against the Poor
Law. No measure of the Whig Government deserved
greater credit than this, or obtained so much unqualified
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">TORY OPPOSITION TO THE POOR LAW.</span>
praise and general support. Inasmuch as the Tories are the
largest landed proprietors, they are the greatest gainers by
the new system, and if a Tory Government should be in
power at the period of the expiration of the Act, they will
not hesitate to renew it. Nevertheless when they found that
some odium was excited in various parts of the country
against the new Poor Law and its administration, many of
them did not scruple to foment the popular discontent, and
all watched its progress with satisfaction when they saw
that it was exclusively directed against their political antagonists.
It has been remarked with truth, that Peel has
observed an almost invariable silence upon this head.
During the discussion of the Bill he seldom took any part;
never opposed it; but, if appealed to, expressed his acquiescence
by silent nods. Of late, when a great clamour has been
raised against the Act, and language bordering on sedition
has been used, he has never said a word in favour of the
system, which it would have been more generous, manly,
and honourable to do than to cover himself with a cautious
and mysterious reserve on so important a subject. The Duke
of Wellington took part in the original measure very frankly;
but at the end of last year, when Lord Stanhope got up a
discussion in the House of Lords on the subject, though
appealed to by Lord Tavistock, the Duke would not say a
word. This was not like him, for with reference to mere
party tactics, it is to his praise that he is generally &lsquo;too fond
of the right to pursue the expedient.&rsquo; It is this behaviour
of the Tories which has shown me that there may be such
a thing as a &lsquo;Tory-Radical;&rsquo; for though I had heard the
appellation, I thought they were contradictory terms which
did not admit of a conjunction. A Tory-Radical is, however,
a politician who for Tory party purposes endeavours to
influence the minds of the people against the laws and their
administration, not because he thinks those laws either ill-contrived
or ill-executed, but because he thinks that the
consequences of such popular discontent will fall upon his
opponents, and that he can render the angry feeling instrumental
to his own selfish or ambitious designs.</p>

<h3>August 30th, 1837</h3>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
All that I hear of the young Queen leads
to the conclusion that she will some day play a conspicuous
part, and that she has a great deal of character. It is clear
enough that she had long been silently preparing herself,
and had been prepared by those about her (and very properly)
for the situation to which she was destined. The impressions
she has made continue to be favourable, and particularly
upon Melbourne, who has a thousand times greater opportunities
of knowing what her disposition and her capacity
are than any other person, and who is not a man to be easily
captivated or dazzled by any superficial accomplishments
or mere graces of manner, or even by personal favour. Melbourne
thinks highly of her sense, discretion, and good
feeling; but what seem to distinguish her above everything
are caution and prudence, the former to a degree which is
almost unnatural in one so young, and unpleasing, because it
suppresses the youthful impulses which are so graceful and
attractive.</p>

<p>On the morning of the King&rsquo;s death, the Archbishop of
Canterbury and Lord Conyngham arrived at Kensington at
five o&rsquo;clock, and immediately desired to see &lsquo;the Queen.&rsquo;
They were ushered into an apartment, and in a few minutes
the door opened and she came in wrapped in a dressing-gown
and with slippers on her naked feet. Conyngham in
a few words told her their errand, and as soon as he uttered
the words &lsquo;Your Majesty,&rsquo; she instantly put out her hand
to him, intimating that he was to kiss hands before he proceeded.
He dropped on one knee, kissed her hand, and then
went on to tell her of the late King&rsquo;s death. She presented
her hand to the Archbishop, who likewise kissed it, and
when he had done so, addressed to her a sort of pastoral
charge, which she received graciously and then retired. She
lost no time in giving notice to Conroy of her intentions
with regard to him; she saw him, and desired him to name
the reward he expected for his services to her parents. He
asked for the Red Riband, an Irish peerage, and a pension of
3,000&#8467;. a year. She replied that the two first rested with her
Ministers, and she could not engage for them, but that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE QUEEN&rsquo;S SELF-POSSESSION.</span>
pension he should have. It is not easy to ascertain the
exact cause of her antipathy to him, but it has probably
grown with her growth, and results from divers causes. The
person in the world she loves best is the Baroness Lehzen,
and Lehzen and Conroy were enemies. There was formerly
a Baroness Spaeth at Kensington, lady-in-waiting to the
Duchess, and Lehzen and Spaeth were intimate friends.
Conroy quarrelled with the latter and got her dismissed,
and this Lehzen never forgave. She may have instilled into
the Princess a dislike and bad opinion of Conroy, and the
evidence of these sentiments, which probably escaped neither
the Duchess nor him, may have influenced their conduct towards
her, for strange as it is, there is good reason to believe
that she thinks she has been ill-used by both of them for
some years past.<a name="FNA_01_09" id="FNA_01_09"></a><a href="#FN_01_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Her manner to the Duchess is, however,
irreproachable, and they appear to be on cordial and affectionate
terms. Madame de Lehzen is the only person who
is constantly with her. When any of the Ministers come to
see her, the Baroness retires at one door as they enter at the
other, and the audience over she returns to the Queen. It
has been remarked that when applications are made to Her
Majesty, she seldom or never gives an immediate answer, but
says she will consider of it, and it is supposed that she does
this because she consults Melbourne about everything, and
waits to have her answer suggested by him. He says, however,
that such is her habit even with him, and that when
he talks to her upon any subject upon which an opinion is
expected from her, she tells him she will think it over, and
let him know her sentiments the next day.</p>

[The Queen, in a letter to her uncle, King Leopold, published with
Her Majesty&rsquo;s sanction, speaks significantly of what she terms &lsquo;my sad
childhood.&rsquo;]</p></div>

<p>The day she went down to visit the Queen Dowager at
Windsor, to Melbourne&rsquo;s great surprise she said to him that
as the flag on the Round Tower was half-mast high, and
they might perhaps think it necessary to elevate it upon
her arrival, it would be better to send orders beforehand not
to do so. <i>He</i> had never thought of the flag, or knew anything
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
about it, but it showed her knowledge of forms and
her attention to trifles. Her manner to the Queen was
extremely kind and affectionate, and they were both greatly
affected at meeting. The Queen Dowager said to her that
the only favour she had to ask of her was to provide for the
retirement, with their pensions, of the personal attendants of
the late King, Whiting and Bachelor, who had likewise been
the attendants of George IV.; to which she replied that it
should be attended to, but she could not give any promise on
the subject.</p>

<p>She is upon terms of the greatest cordiality with Lord
Melbourne, and very naturally. Everything is new and
delightful to her. She is surrounded with the most exciting
and interesting enjoyments; her occupations, her pleasures,
her business, her Court, all present an unceasing round of
gratifications. With all her prudence and discretion she
has great animal spirits, and enters into the magnificent
novelties of her position with the zest and curiosity of a
child.</p>

<p>No man is more formed to ingratiate himself with her
than Melbourne. He treats her with unbounded consideration
and respect, he consults her tastes and her wishes, and he
puts her at her ease by his frank and natural manners, while
he amuses her by the quaint, queer, epigrammatic turn of
his mind, and his varied knowledge upon all subjects. It is
not therefore surprising that she should be well content with
her present Government, and that during the progress of the
elections she should have testified great interest in the success
of the Whig candidates. Her reliance upon Melbourne&rsquo;s
advice extends at present to subjects quite beside his constitutional
functions, for the other day somebody asked her
permission to dedicate some novel to her, when she said she
did not like to grant the permission without knowing the
contents of the work, and she desired Melbourne to read the
book and let her know if it was fit that she should accept the
dedication. Melbourne read the first volume, but found it
so dull that he would not read any more, and sent her word
that she had better refuse, which she accordingly did. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MANGO WINS THE ST. LEGER.</span>
seems to be liberal, but at the same time prudent with
regard to money, for when the Queen Dowager proposed to
her to take her band into her service, she declined to incur
so great an expense without further consideration, but
one of the first things she spoke to Melbourne about was
the payment of her father&rsquo;s debts, which she is resolved to
discharge.</p>

<h3>October 23rd, 1837</h3>

<p>Since August 30th, nearly two months, I
have written not a line, for I have had nothing to record of
public or general interest, and have felt an invincible
repugnance to write about myself or my own proceedings.
Having nothing else to talk of, however, I shall write my
own history of the last seven weeks, which is very interesting
to me inasmuch as it has been very profitable. Having
asked George Bentinck to try my horse &lsquo;Mango&rsquo; before
Doncaster, we went down together one night to Winchester
race-course and saw him tried. He won the trial and we
resolved to back him. This we accomplished more successfully
than we expected, and ten days after he won the
St. Leger, and I won about 9,000&#8467;. upon it, the first <i>great</i>
piece of good fortune that ever happened to me. Since
Doncaster, I have continued (up to this time) to win at
Newmarket, so that my affairs are in a flourishing condition,
but, notwithstanding these successes, I am dissatisfied and
disquieted in my mind, and my life is spent in the alternations
of excitement from the amusement and speculation of
the turf and of remorse and shame at the pursuit itself. One
day I resolve to extricate myself entirely from the whole
concern, to sell all my horses, and pursue other occupations
and objects of interest, and then these resolutions wax faint,
and I again find myself buying fresh animals, entering into
fresh speculations, and just as deeply engaged as ever. It
is the force of habit, a still unconquered propensity to the
sport, and a nervous apprehension that if I do give it up,
I may find no subject of equal interest.</p>

<h3>November 14th, 1837</h3>

<p>Yesterday morning I heard of the death
of Lord Egremont, who died after a week&rsquo;s illness of his old
complaint, an inflammation in the trachea, being within a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
month of eighty-six years
old.<a name="FNA_01_10" id="FNA_01_10"></a><a href="#FN_01_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
He was a remarkable man,
and his death will be more felt within the sphere of his influence
(and that extended over the whole county of Sussex)
than any individual&rsquo;s ever was. He was immensely rich and
his munificence was equal to his wealth. No man probably
ever gave away so much money in promoting charitable
institutions or useful undertakings, and in pensioning,
assisting, and supporting his numerous relations and dependants.
His understanding was excellent, his mind highly
cultivated, and he retained all his faculties, even his memory,
unimpaired to the last. He was remarkably acute, shrewd,
and observant, and in his manner blunt without rudeness,
and caustic without bitterness. Though he had for some
years withdrawn himself from the world, he took an eager
interest and curiosity in all that was passing in it, and
though not mixed up in politics, and sedulously keeping
aloof from all party conflicts, he did not fail to think deeply
and express himself strongly upon the important questions
and events of the times. In his political principles and
opinions he was anti-Liberal, and latterly an alarmist as
well as a Conservative. He had always opposed Catholic
Emancipation, which it is difficult to account for in a man so
sagacious and benevolent, except from the force of prejudices
early instilled into a mind of tenacious grasp which was not
exposed to the changeful influence of worldly commerce and
communication. It is probable that Lord Egremont might
have acted a conspicuous part in politics if he had chosen to
embark on that stormy sea, and upon the rare occasions
when he spoke in the House of Lords, he delivered himself
with great energy and effect; but his temper, disposition,
and tastes were altogether incompatible with the trammels
of office or the restraints of party connexions, and he preferred
to revel unshackled in all the enjoyments of private
life, both physical and intellectual, which an enormous
fortune, a vigorous constitution, and literary habits placed
in abundant variety before him. But in the system of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CHARACTER OF LORD EGREMONT.</span>
happiness which he marked out for himself, the happiness of
others formed a large and essential ingredient; nor did old
age, as it stole upon him with gradual and insensible steps,
dull the brightness of his intellect or chill the warmth of his
heart. His mind was always intent upon providing for the
pleasure or the benefit of those around him, and there was
nothing in which he so keenly delighted as the rural festivals
with which he celebrated his own birthday, when thousands
of the surrounding villagers were assembled in his park to
eat, drink and be merry. He was passionately fond of
children, and animals of every description found favour in his
sight. Lord Egremont was a distinguished patron of artists,
and it was rarely that Petworth was unvisited by some
painter or sculptor, many of whom he kept in almost continual
employment, and by whom his loss will be severely
felt. He was extremely hospitable, and Petworth was open
to all his friends, and to all their friends if they chose to
bring them, provided they did not interfere with his habits
or require any personal attention at his hands: from any
such obligation he considered that his age and infirmities
released him. He received his guests with the utmost
urbanity and courtesy, did the honours of his table, and in
every other respect left them free to abide as long as they
pleased, but to amuse themselves as they could. Petworth
was consequently like a great inn. Everybody came when
they thought fit, and departed without notice or leave-taking.
He liked to have people there who he was certain
would not put him out of his way, especially those who,
entering into his eccentric habits, were ready for the
snatches of talk which his perpetual locomotion alone admitted
of, and from whom he could gather information about
passing events; but it was necessary to conform to his
peculiarities, and these were utterly incompatible with conversation
or any prolonged discussion. He never remained
for five minutes in the same place, and was continually
oscillating between the library and his bedroom, or wandering
about the enormous house in all directions; sometimes
he broke off in the middle of a conversation on some subject
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
which appeared to interest him and disappeared, and an
hour after, on a casual meeting, would resume it just where
he had left off. But this habitual restlessness, which was so
fatal to conversation, served perhaps to exhibit the vivacity
of his mind and its shrewd and epigrammatic turn in a
more remarkable manner: few persons visited Petworth
without being struck with astonishment at the unimpaired
vigour of his intellectual powers. To have lived to a great
age in the practice of beneficence and the dispensation of
happiness, and to die without bodily suffering or mental
decay, in the enjoyment of existence up to the instant of its
close, affords an example of human prosperity, both in life
and in death, which has fallen to the lot of few, but which
may well excite the envy and admiration of all.<a name="FNA_01_11" id="FNA_01_11"></a><a href="#FN_01_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<h3>November 3rd, 1837</h3>

<p>At Court yesterday when the Queen received
the Address of the Commons. She conducts herself
with surprising dignity: the dignity which proceeds from
self-possession and deliberation. The smallness of her stature
is quite forgotten in the majesty and gracefulness of her
demeanour.</p>

<p>The Session has opened merrily with an angry squabble
between Lord John Russell and the Radicals, at which the
Tories greatly rejoice. Upon the Address, Wakley and others
thought fit to introduce the topic of the Ballot and other
reforms, upon which John Russell spoke out and declared
he would never be a party to the Ballot, and would not
reform the Reform Bill. They were indignant, and attacked
him in no measured terms. The next night Charles Buller
returned to the charge with equal violence, when Lord
John made (by the agreement of all parties) an incomparable
speech vindicating his own consistency, explaining
his motives for making the declaration which he did the first
night, and repelling with great dignity the charges with
which he was
assailed.<a name="FNA_01_12" id="FNA_01_12"></a><a href="#FN_01_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Of course opinions vary as to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RADICAL DISCONTENT.</span>
expediency and propriety of his conduct on this occasion,
but I do not see that he could have acted otherwise, and
it is much more manly, straightforward, and honourable to
declare at once what his sentiments and intentions are
than to endeavour to evade the subject for a time, and
to raise hopes and expectations which he has no design of
realising, and which, whenever he does declare himself,
as eventually he must, would only excite the bitterer disappointment
and resentment. However, whether he acted
wisely or not, the immediate effect has been to enrage the
Radical section of his party exceedingly, and those who
want the Government to be turned out fondly hope that this
split among them will bring about the consummation.
This is not probable, for angry as they may be, they will still
prefer Melbourne to Peel, and O&rsquo;Connell (who is all moderation)
will throw Ireland into the scale and entreat them for
Ireland&rsquo;s sake to lay aside their resentment. Such questions
as the Ballot can only be carried by the desire for them gaining
ground largely throughout the country, and this many
assert to be the case. At this moment it is pretty clear that
the people care very little about speculative questions, and
want only peace and tranquillity. It is also said that there
is a growing anti-Catholic and anti-Irish spirit which the
Conservatives do their best to excite and extend. It would
be a curious speculation, supposing both these influences to
operate widely, to anticipate the result of their action upon
the great antagonist parties in the country, and see which
would gain most by a coalition of Radical and sectarian
principles. A state of things might by possibility arise
when they would act as mutual checks.</p>

<p>[The Editor of these Journals may here be permitted to

Greville began, as he was appointed to an office in the Privy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Council on November 17, 1837. This acquaintance speedily
ripened into confidential friendship, which was uninterrupted
for a single day in the course of the next eight-and-twenty
years. Indeed Mr. Greville&rsquo;s kind offices to his young
acquaintance began immediately; for the appointment of
Mr. Reeve having been attacked with great bitterness by
Lord Brougham, who was then extremely hostile to every
department of the Government, Mr. Greville exerted himself
with his usual energy to defend it.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place, though it is out of date, to
insert here, as a memorial of this long friendship, a note
written to the Editor of these Journals by Mr. Greville, on
May 6, 1859, when he had just resigned the office of Clerk of
the Council. It is in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>My dear R.,&mdash;I will not delay to thank you warmly for your kind
note. Your accession to the Privy Council Office gave me a friendship
which I need not say how much I have valued through so many
years of happy intercourse, which I rejoice at thinking has never
been clouded or interrupted and which, I hope, will last the same as
long as I last myself. It is always painful to do anything for the last
time, and I cannot without emotion take leave of an office where I
have experienced for so many years so much kindness, consideration,
and goodwill; but I hope still to be considered as <i>amicus curiæ</i> and
to be applied to on every occasion when I can be of use to the Office.
Between you and me there has been, I think, as much as possible
between any two people the &lsquo;idem velle, idem nolle, et idem sentire
de republicâ,&rsquo; and, in consequence, the &lsquo;firma amicitia.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>November 26th, 1837</h3>

<p>It is still a matter of general discussion
and speculation whether Lord John Russell&rsquo;s bold declaration
will have the effect of breaking up the Government by
disgusting the Radicals to such a degree as to make them in
spite withdraw their aid on some important occasion. Those
gentry are still very irate and sulky, but I do not expect
they will connive at the overthrow of the Government;
they know better than to open the doors of office to the
Tories.
Lord Brougham has taken the field with a violent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">COMMITTEE ON THE PENSION LIST.</span>
Radical speech, and he seized an occasion to set his tongue
wagging against the Chancellor; in short he seems bent on
mischief. He has written word to Lord Granville that he
would not be gagged this Session; he will be glad to lead
anybody who will be led by him; and as the post of general
of the Radicals appears to be vacant, he may aspire to that.
His actual position as contrasted with his vast abilities is
indeed calculated to &lsquo;point a moral.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>December 8th, 1837</h3>

<p>The notion of a break-up of the Government
has gradually faded away, and though the Radicals
have not forgiven John Russell for his speech, they appear
to have no intention of altering their conduct towards the
Government, and some concessions have already been made
partly for the purpose of mollifying them. Government
have given up the Pension List, and it is believed that the
Ballot is to be made an open question. This will be considered
more than an equivalent for the discouraging
effect of John Russell&rsquo;s speech. Peel and the Tories oppose
the Committee on the
Pensions,<a name="FNA_01_13" id="FNA_01_13"></a><a href="#FN_01_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
but it is remarkable that on
the Civil List Committee the other day, when Rice proposed
that 75,000&#8467;. should be granted for pensions, and Grote moved
to suspend the grant till after the Pensions Committee had
reported, Peel and his people (Goulburn, Harding, Fremantle,
&amp;c.) supported Grote, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer
was in a minority of one. This too was an accident, for
Francis Baring was absent from the division on account of
the following circumstance. In a speech in the House of
Lords the night before on the Post Office, Lord Lichfield<a name="FNA_01_14" id="FNA_01_14"></a><a href="#FN_01_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
had attacked Mr. Wallace with great severity, and immediately
after Wallace sent him a message which was tantamount
to a challenge. Alvanley was employed to settle the
quarrel, which he did, but it became necessary to instruct
Baring to say something on the subject in the House of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Commons, where Wallace was going to allude to it. Alvanley
detained Baring so long that he was too late for the
division in the Committee; had he been there and made the
numbers even, Rice, as chairman, must have given the
casting vote for or against his own proposition, either of
which would have been very awkward, but it is not very
clear why Peel voted as he did.</p>

[The Chancellor of the Exchequer moved for a Select Committee to

<p>Lord Roden brought on the Irish question in the House of Lords, when
Mulgrave<a name="FNA_01_15" id="FNA_01_15"></a><a href="#FN_01_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
made a very triumphant vindication
of himself and utterly discomfited the Orangemen.
The Duke of Wellington made a very clever speech, and
availed himself of the contradictory returns of crimes and
convictions skilfully enough, but he had the candour to give
Mulgrave ample credit for the vigour with which he had
caused the law to be enforced, and, as for months past the
Orangemen had been clamouring against the Irish Government
for neglecting to enforce the law and for depriving
Protestants of its protection, it was a very magnanimous
admission on the Duke&rsquo;s part, and such a one as few of his
political opponents would have made. It is the peculiar
merit of the Duke that he is never disposed to sacrifice
truth for a party purpose, and it is this manliness and
straightforwardness, this superiority to selfish considerations
and temporary ends, which render him the object of universal
respect and admiration, and will hereafter surround
his political character with unfading honour. Not content
with the defeat which they sustained in the House of Lords,
the Orangemen had the folly to provoke another contest in
the House of Commons, and Colonel Verner brought forward
&lsquo;the Battle of the Diamond,&rsquo; giving Morpeth an
opportunity of another triumph as signal as Mulgrave&rsquo;s in
the House of Lords. The Irish Orangemen were left to
their fate on this occasion, for none of their English associates
came to their relief.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MR. DISRAELI&rsquo;S FIRST SPEECH.</span>
beginning with florid assurance, speedily degenerating into

[Mr. Disraeli&rsquo;s first speech was made on the motion with reference to
what was called &lsquo;the Spottiswoode Gang.&rsquo; An association had been formed
in London for the purpose of collecting money to test the validity of the
Irish elections wholesale. Mr. Spottiswoode, one of the Queen&rsquo;s printers,
was the president of this association, which was denounced by the Radicals
and the Irish Members as &lsquo;the Spottiswoode Gang,&rsquo; and attacked in Parliament
by Mr. Blewitt, who moved five resolutions condemning the institution
of the Spottiswoode fund. Lord John Russell, however, discouraged the
attack, on the ground that the number of election petitions in the present
year was not such as to warrant any extraordinary measures in regard to
them. Mr. Blewitt withdrew four of his resolutions and left the House
without moving the fifth. <i>Solvuntur risu tabulæ</i>.]</p></div>

<p>The new House of Commons does not promise to be a
more business-like or more decorous assembly than its immediate
predecessor. Already two whole nights have been
consumed in the discussion of two topics so unprofitable as
&lsquo;the Battle of the Diamond&rsquo; and &lsquo;the Spottiswoode Gang,&rsquo;
and it is said that such a scene of disorder and such a beargarden
never was beheld. The noise and confusion are
so great that the proceedings can hardly be heard or understood,
and it was from something growing out of this confusion
and uproar that the Speaker thought it necessary to
address the House last night and complain that he no longer
enjoyed its confidence, and if he saw any future indication
that such was the case he should resign the Chair. His
declaration was taken very quietly, for nobody said a word.</p>

<p>Brougham made a great speech on education the other
night, but it was so long, tedious, and digressive that he
drove everybody away. He is in a very bitter state of mind,
scarcely speaking to any of his former friends and colleagues,
and having acquired no new friends of any party. He
courts the Radicals, and writes letters and makes speeches
directly at variance with all his former professions and
opinions; but the Radicals, though they do not object to
make use of him, will by no means trust him.</p>

<p>I asked Charles Buller if they would have Lord Brougham
for their leader, and he said &lsquo;certainly not,&rsquo; and added that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
&lsquo;Durham had done nothing as yet to forfeit their confidence.&rsquo;
He enlightened me at the same time about his own Radical
opinions and views and the extent of them, together with
those of the more moderate of his party, complaining that
they were misrepresented and misunderstood; although for
the Ballot and extension of the suffrage, he is opposed to reform
of the House of Lords or any measure directly affecting
the Constitution. He does not admit that the measures he
advocates do affect the Constitution directly or
indirectly.<a name="FNA_01_17" id="FNA_01_17"></a><a href="#FN_01_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
I told him if he repudiated the violent maxims of Molesworth
and others, he should not let these ultra-Radicals be
the organs of the party, as the world did not and could not
distinguish between them, especially as the Moderates took
no steps to clear themselves and establish juster notions of
the character and tendency of their principles. He did not
deny this, but they dread an appearance of disunion; so, as
always happens when this is the case, the most exalted and
exaggerated of the party, who will not be silenced and are
reckless of consequences, take the lead and keep it.</p>

<h3>December 12th, 1837</h3>

<p>On the debate about Pensions the other
night Whittle Harvey outdid himself; by all accounts it was
inimitable, dramatic to the greatest degree, and acted to perfection.
Peel was heavy, Stanley very smart, the Ministers
were beaten hollow in the argument, but got a respectable
division, of which they make the most; but it proves
nothing as to their real strength, which has not yet been
tested. John Russell made a wretched speech, being obliged
to vote in the teeth of his former opinions and conduct.</p>

<h3>December 14th, 1837</h3>

<p>There was a grand breeze in the House
of Lords the night before last between Melbourne and
Brougham. The latter is said to have been in a towering
passion, and he vociferated and gesticulated with might and
main. Jonathan Peel was in the Lobby, and being attracted
by the noise, ran to the House, and found Brougham not
only on his legs, but on tip-toes in the middle of his indignant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD BROUGHAM AND LORD MELBOURNE.</span>
rejoinder. Melbourne&rsquo;s attack upon him seemed
hardly called for, but I heard he had declared he would not
much longer endure the continual twittings and punchings
that Brougham every day dealt out to some one or other of
the Ministers. The Chancellor, Lord Lansdowne, and Glenelg,
had all suffered in their turns, and so when Brougham
taunted him with his courtly habits, he could not restrain
himself, and retorted savagely though not very well. What
he said was nothing but a <i>tu quoque</i>, and only remarkable
for the bitter tone in which it was uttered and the sort of
reproach it conveyed. Probably Melbourne thought it as
well to put an end at once to the half hostile, half amicable
state of their mutual relations, to their &lsquo;noble friendship,&rsquo;
and real enmity, and to bring matters to a crisis, otherwise
he might have had some indulgence for his old friend and
colleague, have made allowance for the workings of deep
disappointment and mortification on his excitable temperament,
and have treated him with forbearance out of reverence
for his rare acquirements and capacity. But the fact is,
that Brougham has ostentatiously proclaimed the dissolution
of all his former ties, and has declared war against all
his ancient connexions; he has abandoned his friends and
his principles together, and has enrolled himself in a
Radical fellowship which would have been the object of his
scorn and detestation in his calmer moods and in more prosperous
days.</p>

<p>Le Marchant, who was his secretary for four years,
and knows him well, told me that no man was a greater
aristocrat in his heart than Brougham, from conviction
attached to aristocracy, from taste desirous of being one
of its members. He said that Dugald Stewart, when
talking of his pupils, had said though he envied most the
understanding of Horner (whom he loved with peculiar
affection), he considered Brougham the ablest man he had
ever known, but that even then (forty years ago) he considered
his to be a mind that was continually oscillating on
the verge of insanity. Le Marchant said that Brougham&rsquo;s
powers of application exceeded what he had believed possible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of any human being. He had known him work incessantly
from nine in the morning till one at night, and at the end be
as fresh apparently as when he began. He could turn from
one subject to another with surprising facility and promptitude,
in the same day travelling through the details of a
Chancery cause, writing a philosophical or mathematical
treatise, correcting articles for the &lsquo;Library of Useful Knowledge,&rsquo;
and preparing a great speech for the House of Lords.
When one thinks of the greatness of his genius and the
depth of his fall, from the loftiest summit of influence,
power, and fame to the lowest abyss of political degradation,
in spite of the faults and the follies of his character
and conduct, one cannot help feeling regret and compassion
at the sight of such a noble wreck and of so much glory
obscured.</p>

<h3>December 24th, 1837</h3>

<p>News of the insurrection in Canada
arrived the day before yesterday, and produced a debate of
some animation in the House of Commons, in which the
Radicals principally figured, making speeches of such exceeding
violence that it was only justifiable to pass them over,
because those who uttered them are not worth notice.
Gladstone spoke very well, and Lord John Russell closed the
discussion with an excellent speech just such as a Minister
ought to make, manly, temperate, and constitutional. He is
a marvellous little man, always equal to the occasion, afraid
of nobody, fixed in his principles, clear in his ideas, collected
in his manner, and bold and straightforward in his disposition.
He invariably speaks well when a good speech is
required from him, and this is upon every important question,
for he gets no assistance from any of his colleagues, except
now and then from Howick. This is a fine occasion for
attacking the Government and placing them between two
fires, for the Radicals abuse them for their tyrannical and
despotic treatment of the Canadians, and the Tories attribute
the rebellion to their culpable leniency and futile
attempts at conciliation by concessions which never ought
to have been made, and only were made out of complaisance
to the Radicals here. As generally happens when there are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE INSURRECTION IN CANADA.</span>
charges of an opposite nature, and incompatible with one
another, neither of them is true.</p>

<p>Since Brougham and Melbourne&rsquo;s set-to in the House of
Lords, the former has been speaking every day and entering
a protest about every other day. He is in a state of permanent
activity, and means to lead such of the Radicals as
will enlist under his ragged banner. He was quite furious
about the Civil List, and evidently means to outbid everybody
for popularity. He goes on belabouring and &lsquo;befriending&rsquo;
the Government Lords, but the effect he produces (if any)
is out of doors, for he usually wastes his rhetoric on empty
benches.</p>

<p>The Queen went to the House yesterday without producing
any sensation. There was the usual crowd to look
at the finery of carriages, horses, Guards, &amp;c., but not a
hat raised nor a voice heard: the people of England seem
inclined to hurrah no more.</p>

<h3>December 30th, 1837</h3>

<p>Since the receipt of Colborne&rsquo;s
despatches,<a name="FNA_01_18" id="FNA_01_18"></a><a href="#FN_01_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
the alarm about Canada has subsided, and if
Ministers had been aware that matters were no worse, probably
Parliament would have had longer holidays. Nobody
doubts that the insurrection will be easily put down, but the
difficulty will be how to settle matters afterwards. It does
not appear that this Government has been more to blame
than any other, for the same system seems to have been
pursued by all. They might indeed have adopted decisive
measures at an earlier period, and as soon as they found
that the Assembly was invincibly obstinate and deaf to the
voice of reason, they ought to have put an end to the
humiliating contest by an assertion of Imperial power. All
that can be said is, that they tried the conciliatory power too
long.</p>

[Sir John Colborne was Lieutenant-Governor of Canada at the time
the insurrection broke out, and the suppression of it was mainly due to the
vigorous measures taken by him on the spot. For these services he was

age of eighty-four.]</p></div>

<h3>Burghley, January 2nd, 1838</h3>

<p>Among other changes of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
habit, it has occurred to me why should not I begin the New
Year by keeping a regular diary? What I do write are
merely fragments of memoirs with passing events briefly
alluded to, and the odds and ends collected from different
sources recorded and commented on. It is not the first
time I have had thoughts of keeping a more regular journal,
in which not only my doings should be noted down and my
goings, but which would also preserve some record of my
thoughts and feelings, if ever indeed I really do think and
feel. The reason I have never done anything of this sort is
partly that I have been too idle, and the result partly of
modesty and partly of vanity. A journal to be good, true,
and interesting, should be written without the slightest reference
to publication, but without any fear of it; it should be
the transcript of a mind which can bear transcribing. I do
not in sincerity believe that my mind, or thoughts, or actions,
are of sufficient importance or interest to make it worth
while (for the sake of others) to take this trouble. I always
contemplate the possibility that hereafter my journal will be
read by the public, always greedy of such things, and I
regard with alarm and dislike the notion of its containing
a heap of twaddle and trash concerning matters appertaining
to myself which nobody else will care three straws about.
If therefore I discard these scruples and do what I meditate
(and very likely after all I shall not, or only for a very short
time), the next thing is, Why? It seems exceedingly ridiculous
to say that one strong stimulus proceeds from reading
Scott&rsquo;s Diary&mdash;which he began very late in life and in consequence
of reading Byron&rsquo;s&mdash;not because I fancy I can
write a diary as amusing as Scott&rsquo;s or Byron&rsquo;s, but because
I am struck by the excessive pleasure which Scott appeared
to derive from writing his journal, and I am (and this is the
principal cause) struck with the important use to which the
habit may be turned. The habit of recording is first of all
likely to generate a desire to have something of some interest
to record; it will lead to habits of reflexion and to trains of
thought, the pursuit of which may be pleasing and profitable;
it will exercise the memory and sharpen the understanding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON AT BURLEIGH.</span>
generally; and though the thoughts may not be
very profound, nor the remarks very lively or ingenious, nor
the narrative of exceeding interest, still the exercise is, I
think, calculated to make the writer wiser, and perhaps
better. If I do this I shall read over all I write long before
anyone else will have an opportunity of doing so, and I am
not likely to be over-indulgent if I find myself a bore.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I left town, slept at Newmarket, saw
the horses, rode out on the Warren Hill, and came here to
dinner, where I find twenty-two people&mdash;the Duke of Wellington
and Lord Aberdeen, the Salisburys, Wiltons, and a
mob of fine people; very miserable representatives of old Lord
Burleigh, the two insignificant-looking Marquesses, who are
his lineal descendants, and who display no more of his
brains than they do of his beard. The Duke of Wellington
is in great force, talked last night of Canada, and said he
thought the first operations had been a failure, and he
judged so because the troops could neither take the rebel
chief, nor hold their ground, nor return by any other road
than that by which they came; that if Colborne could hold
Montreal during the winter it would do very well, but he
was not sure that he would be able to do so; that the
Government ought to exhibit to the world their determination
to put this revolt down, and that to do so they must seal the
St. Lawrence<a name="FNA_01_19" id="FNA_01_19"></a><a href="#FN_01_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
so as to prevent the ingress of
foreigners, who would flock to Canada for employment against
us; that the Queen could not blockade her own ports, so that
they must apply to Parliament for power to effect this, and
they ought to bring in a Bill forthwith for the purpose.
This morning he got a letter (from a man he did not know)
enclosing the latest news, which he thought very good, and
promising better and more decisive results. After breakfast
they went shooting.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_01_19" id="FN_01_19"></a><a href="#FNA_01_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a>
The Duke expressed no such opinion in either of his speeches on
Canada (February 4th).</p></div>

<p>I walked out and joined the Duke, who talked to me for
I dare say an hour and a half about his Spanish campaigns,
and most interesting it was. I told him that the other day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Allen<a name="FNA_01_20" id="FNA_01_20"></a><a href="#FN_01_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
had asked me to find somebody, a military man,
to review the Wellington Despatches in the &lsquo;Edinburgh
Review,&rsquo; and that he had suggested Sir George Murray
as the fittest person if he would undertake it; that I had
accordingly spoken to Fitzroy Somerset, who had agreed to
apply to Murray; and, if Murray would not do it, I begged
him to turn in his mind what officer could be found equal
to such a task, and I then asked the Duke if he knew of
anybody. He seemed amazingly pleased at the idea, said
he knew nobody, but Murray was the fittest man. From
this he began to talk, and told me a great deal of various
matters, which I wish I could have taken down as it fell
from his lips. I was amused at the simplicity with which
he talked of the great interest of these Despatches, just
as he might have done if they had been the work of any
other man; said he had read them himself with considerable
astonishment and great interest, and that everybody might
see that there was not one word in them that was not
strictly and literally true. He said of his generals, &lsquo;that in
the beginning they none of them knew anything of the
matter, that he was obliged to go from division to division
and look to everything himself down to the minutest details.&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;What on earth would have happened if anything
had befallen you?&rsquo; He laughed and said, &lsquo;I really do not
know. There was a great deal of correspondence about my
successor at the time Sir Thomas Graham went
home.<a name="FNA_01_21" id="FNA_01_21"></a><a href="#FN_01_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
I was against having any second in command, which was
quite useless, as nobody could share the responsibility with
me. However, afterwards Graham came back, and then
there was Hope next to him.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Hill had invariably
done well, always exactly obeyed my orders, and executed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE BATTLE OF SALAMANCA.</span>
them successfully.&rsquo; The fall of Badajoz was a great blow to
him, but he did not know that it was by an act of treachery.
The Spanish Government perhaps did not believe that he
was approaching to relieve the place, but it was a most
curious fact, that whereas it was agreed that the Spanish
army should march out over the breach with the honours
of war, they were obliged, after the capitulation, to make a
breach for them to go over, none having been made by the
besiegers. The General, with whom he finds much fault (in
the ninth volume) for disobeying his orders and making false
movements, was Victor Allen, but he said he treated him
with great leniency, and so he did his officers on all occasions,
and was as forbearing and indulgent with them as it
was possible to be.</p>

<p>All the movements and operations before the battle of
Salamanca were to the last degree interesting. The Duke was
anxiously waiting for some advantageous occasion to attack
Marmont, and at last it arrived; he saw it happen, and took
his resolution on the spot. He was dining in a farm-yard
with his officers, where (when he had done dinner) everybody
else came and dined as they could. The whole French army
was in sight, moving, and the enemy firing upon the farmyard
in which he was dining. &lsquo;I got up,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and was
looking over a wall round the farm-yard, just such a wall as
that&rsquo; (pointing to a low stone wall bounding the covert), &lsquo;and
I saw the movement of the French left through my glass.
&ldquo;By God,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that will do, and I&rsquo;ll attack them
directly.&rdquo; I had moved up the Sixth Division through
Salamanca, which the French were not aware of, and I
ordered them to attack, and the whole line to advance. I had
got my army so completely in hand that I could do this with
ease, and in forty minutes the battle was won&mdash;&lsquo;quarante
mille hommes battus en quarante minutes.&rsquo; I asked him if it
was true that he and Marmont had subsequently talked over
the event of the battle, and that Marmont had asserted that
his orders had been disobeyed, or that this movement of
which the Duke took advantage would not have been made.
He said he believed there had been some conversation on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
subject, and that Marmont had said he was wounded before
this movement took place; he said he did not know if this
was true, but it might be, as there had been continual fighting
for some time previous. I asked him why Bonaparte
had not himself come to Spain to attack him; and if he had
with a great force, whether he would have driven him out.
He replied that he thought Napoleon had satisfied himself
that it would be a work of great difficulty, and what was more,
of great length, and he had no mind to embark in it; and
that the French certainly would not have driven him out: he
should have taken up some position, and have been enabled
to baffle the Emperor himself just as he had done his
marshals. He thinks that Napoleon&rsquo;s military system compelled
him to employ his armies in war, when they invariably
lived upon the resources of the countries they occupied, and
that France could not have maintained them, as she
must have done if he had made peace: peace, therefore,
would have brought about (through the army itself) his
downfall. He traces the whole military system of France
from its first organisation during the Reign of Terror, in a
letter in the tenth volume of the Despatches. I asked him
how he reconciled what he had said of the extraordinary
discipline of the French army with their unsparing and
habitual plunder of the country, and he said that though
they plundered in the most remorseless way, there was order
and discipline in their plundering, and while they took from
the inhabitants everything they could lay their hands upon, it
was done in the way of requisition, and that they plundered
for the army and not for themselves individually, but they were
reduced to great shifts for food. At the battle of Fuentes
d&rsquo;Onor he saw the French soldiers carry off horses that were
killed to be cooked and eaten in another part of the field.
&lsquo;I saw particularly with my own eyes one horse put upon a
cart drawn by two bullocks (they could not afford to kill the
bullocks), and drawn off; and I desired a man to watch
where the cart went, and it was taken to another French

reduced to eat horseflesh.&rsquo; I remarked that he alluded in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">A PARTY AT BELVOIR CASTLE.</span>
one of his letters to his having been once very nearly taken,
and he said it was just before the battle of Talavera in
consequence of some troops giving way. He was on a ruined
tower from which he was obliged to leap down; and if he
had not been young and active, as he was in those days, he
should certainly have been taken.</p>

<p>He talked a great deal of the Spanish character, unchanged
to this day; of the vast difficulties he had had to
contend with from both Spanish and Portuguese Governments,
the latter as bad as the former; of their punctilios
and regard to form and ceremony. &lsquo;At the time of the battle of the
Pyrenees<a name="FNA_01_22" id="FNA_01_22"></a><a href="#FN_01_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
I had occasion to send O&rsquo;Donnel to
advance, and he was mightily affronted because he did not
receive the order by an officer from head-quarters. I was
living under hedges and ditches, and had not been to
head-quarters for several days, and so I told him, but that he
should have an order if he pleased in the proper form.&rsquo; I
asked him if it was not then that he found the troops in
full retreat. He said they were beginning to retreat when
he arrived, &lsquo;then they threw up their caps and made a most
brilliant affair of it.&rsquo;</p>

is known in history as the &lsquo;battle of the Pyrenees,&rsquo; but the expression
doubtless relates to the actions which were fought in the Pyrenees, after
Soult took the command of the French army in July 1814.]</p></div>

<p>It is impossible to convey an idea of the zest, eagerness,
frankness, and <i>abundance</i> with which he talked, and told of
his campaigns, or how interesting it was to hear him. He
expressed himself very warmly about Hill, of all his generals,
and said, &lsquo;When I gave him my memorandum about Canada
the other day I said, Why it looks as if we were at our old
trade again.&rsquo; He added that he &lsquo;always gave his opinion
when it was required on any subject.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>Belvoir Castle, January 4th, 1838</h3>

<p>Came here yesterday, all
the party (almost) migrating, and many others coming from
various parts to keep the Duke of Rutland&rsquo;s birthday. We
are nearly forty at dinner, but it is no use enumerating
the people. Last night the Duke of Wellington talked of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Hanover, said he really did not know much of the matter;
that neither William IV. nor George IV. had ever talked to
him on the subject or he must have made himself acquainted
with it; that the Duke of Cumberland had written him word
that he had never had any notion of adopting the measures
he has since done till he was going over in the packet with Billy
Holmes.<a name="FNA_01_23" id="FNA_01_23"></a><a href="#FN_01_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
The Duke wrote him word that he knew
nothing of his case, and the only advice he could give him
was to let the affair be settled as speedily as possible.
When the late King had evidently only a few days to live,
the Duke of Cumberland consulted the Duke as to what he
should do. &lsquo;I told him the best thing he could do was to
go away as fast as he could: Go instantly,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and
take care that <i>you don&rsquo;t get pelted</i>.&rsquo; The Duke, Aberdeen,
and FitzGerald all condemned his proceedings without reference
to their justice or to his legal and constitutional
right as regards Hanover, but on account of the impression
(no matter right or wrong) which they are calculated to
produce in this country, where it ought to be a paramount
interest with him to preserve or acquire as good a character
as he can. They all declared that Lyndhurst was equally
ignorant with themselves of his views and intentions, with
which in fact the Conservatives had no sort of concern.
The Duke also advised him not to take the oaths as Privy
Councillor, or those of a Peer in the House of Lords, because
he thought it would do him an injury in the eyes of
his new subjects, that he, a King, should swear fealty as
her subject to the Queen as his Sovereign; but somebody
else (he thought the Duke of Buckingham) overruled this
advice, and he had himself a fancy to take the oaths.</p>

<p>To-day we<a name="FNA_01_24" id="FNA_01_24"></a><a href="#FN_01_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
went to see the house Mr. Gregory is building,
five miles from here. He is a gentleman of about
12,000&#8467;. a year, who has a fancy to build a magnificent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MR. GREGORY&rsquo;S HOUSE AND ESTATE.</span>
house in the Elizabethan style, and he is now in the middle
of his work, all the shell being finished except one wing.
Nothing can be more perfect than it is, both as to the architecture
and the ornaments; but it stands on the slope of a
hill upon a deep clay soil, with no park around it, very little
wood, and scarcely any fine trees. Many years ago, when
he first conceived this design, he began to amass money and
lived for no other object. He travelled into all parts of
Europe collecting objects of curiosity, useful or ornamental,
for his projected palace, and he did not begin to build until
he had accumulated money enough to complete his design.
The grandeur of it is such, and such the tardiness of its
progress, that it is about as much as he will do to live till
its completion; and as he is not married, has no children,
and dislikes the heir on whom his property is entailed, it is
the means and not the end to which he looks for gratification.
He says that it is his amusement, as hunting or
shooting or feasting may be the objects of other people; and
as the pursuit leads him into all parts of the world, and to
mix with every variety of nation and character, besides
engendering tastes pregnant with instruction and curious
research, it is not irrational, although he should never
inhabit his house, and may be toiling and saving for the
benefit of persons he cares nothing about. The cottages
round Harlaxton are worth seeing. It has been his fancy
to build a whole village in all sorts of strange fantastic
styles. There are Dutch and Swiss cottages, every variety
of old English, and heaps of nondescript things, which
appear only to have been built for variety&rsquo;s sake. The
effect is extremely pretty. Close to the village is an old
manor house, the most perfect specimen I ever saw of such
a building, the habitation of an English country gentleman
of former times, and there were a buff jerkin and a pair of
jack boots hanging up in the hall, which the stout old
Cavalier of the seventeenth century (and one feels sure that
the owner of that house was a Cavalier) had very likely
worn at Marston Moor or Naseby.</p>

<p>To-day (the cook told me) nearly four hundred people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
will dine in the Castle. We all went into the servants&rsquo;
hall, where one hundred and forty-five retainers had just
done dinner and were drinking the Duke&rsquo;s health, singing
and speechifying with vociferous applause, shouting, and
clapping of hands. I never knew before that oratory had
got down into the servants&rsquo; hall, but learned that it is the
custom for those to whom &lsquo;the gift of the gab&rsquo; has been
vouchsafed to harangue the others, the palm of eloquence
being universally conceded to Mr. Tapps the head coachman,
a man of great abdominal dignity, and whose Ciceronian
brows are adorned with an ample flaxen wig, which is the
peculiar distinction of the functionaries of the whip. I
should like to bring the surly Radical here who scowls
and snarls at &lsquo;the selfish aristocracy who have no
sympathies with the people,&rsquo; and when he has seen these
hundreds feasting in the Castle, and heard their loud shouts
of joy and congratulation, and then visited the villages
around, and listened to the bells chiming all about the vale,
say whether &lsquo;the greatest happiness of the greatest number&rsquo;
would be promoted by the destruction of all the feudality
which belongs inseparably to this scene, and by the substitution
of some abstract political rights for all the beef and
ale and music and dancing with which they are made merry
and glad even for so brief a space. The Duke of Rutland
is as selfish a man as any of his class&mdash;that is, he never
does what he does not like, and spends his whole life in a
round of such pleasures as suit his taste, but he is neither
a foolish nor a bad man, and partly from a sense of duty,
partly from inclination, he devotes time and labour to the
interest and welfare of the people who live and labour on his
estate. He is a Guardian of a very large Union, and he
not only attends regularly the meetings of Poor Law Guardians
every week or fortnight, and takes an active part in
their proceedings, but he visits those paupers who receive
out-of-door relief, sits and converses with them, invites them
to complain to him if they have anything to complain of, and
tells them that he is not only their friend but their representative
at the assembly of Guardians, and it is his duty to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LIFE AT BELVOIR.</span>
see that they are nourished and protected. To my mind
there is more &lsquo;sympathy&rsquo; in this than in railing at the rich
and rendering the poor discontented, weaning them from
their habitual attachments and respects, and teaching them
that the political quacks and adventurers who flatter and
cajole them are their only real friends.</p>

<p>We had a great ball last night, opened by the Duke of
Rutland and Duchess of Sutherland, who had to sail down
at least a hundred couple of tenants, shopkeepers, valets,
and abigails. The Duke of Newcastle gave the Duke&rsquo;s
health at dinner instead of the Duke of Wellington, who
generally discharges that office. He made a boggling business
of it, but apologised in sufficiently handsome terms for
being spokesman instead of the Duke of Wellington. The
Duke of Rutland made a very respectable speech in reply,
and it all went off swimmingly. To-day I went to see the
hounds throw off; but though a hunter was offered to me
would not ride him, because there is no use in risking the
hurt or ridicule of a fall for one day. A man who goes out
in this casual way and hurts himself looks as foolish as an
amateur soldier who gets wounded in a battle in which he is
tempted by curiosity to mingle. So I rode with the mob,
saw a great deal of galloping about and the hounds conveniently
running over hills and vales all in sight, and then
came home. They said a thousand people were out, many
attracted by the expectation of the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s
appearing, but he was rheumatic and could not come out.
He is incessantly employed in writing military statements
and memoranda, having been consulted by the Government,
or probably by Lord Hill on behalf of the Government,
both on this Canadian question, and on the general government
of the army, and he will take as much pains to give
useful advice to Melbourne&rsquo;s Government as if he and Peel
were in office. There never was a man who so entirely sank
all party considerations in national objects, and he has had
the glory of living to hear this universally acknowledged.
Brougham said of him, &lsquo;That man&rsquo;s first object is to serve
his country, with a sword if necessary, or with a pick-axe.&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
He also said of the Duke&rsquo;s Despatches, &lsquo;They will be remembered
when I and others (mentioning some of the most eminent
men) will be forgotten.&rsquo; Aberdeen told the Duke this, and
he replied with the greatest simplicity, &lsquo;It is very true:
when I read them I was myself astonished, and I can&rsquo;t
think how the devil I could have written them.&rsquo; This is
very characteristic, very curious from a man who has not
one grain of conceit in his disposition; but really great men
are equally free from undue vanity or affected modesty, and
know very well the value of what they do.</p>

<p>Last night I sat next to Lord FitzGerald at dinner, who
said that if ever his memoirs appeared (he did not say that
any existed) they would contain many curious things, and
among them the proofs that the events which were supposed
to have been the proximate cause of the Catholic question
being carried were not the real cause, and that the resolution
of the Duke of Wellington is traceable to other sources,
which he could not reveal.</p>

<h3>Melton, January 7th, 1838 (Lord Wilton&rsquo;s house)</h3>

<p>I came here
to-day from Belvoir. Last night the Duke of Wellington
narrated the battle of Toulouse and other Peninsular
recollections. All the room collected round him, listening with
eager curiosity, but I was playing at whist and lost it all.
FitzGerald said to me that he had a great mind to write upon
Ireland, and make a statement of the conduct of England
towards Ireland for ages past; that he had mentioned his idea
to Peel, who had replied, &lsquo;Well, and if you do, I am not the
man to object to your doing so.&rsquo; This he meant as a trait
of his fairness and candour; but the fact is that it is Peel&rsquo;s
interest that all Irish questions should be settled, and he
would rejoice at anything which tended to accelerate a
settlement, and I am no great believer in his fairness. I
was struck with a great admiration for Peel during his
hundred days&rsquo; struggle, when he made a gallant fight; but
this has very much cooled since that time.</p>

<p>FitzGerald said one thing in conversation with me of
which I painfully felt the truth, that an addiction to worthless
or useless pursuits did an irretrievable injury to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">REFLEXIONS.</span>
mental faculties. It is not only the actual time wasted
which might have been turned to good account; the slender
store of knowledge acquired on all subjects instead of the
accumulation which there might have been; but, more than
these, the relaxation of the mental powers till they become
incapable of vigorous exertion or sustained effort:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>I feel myself a miserable example of this species of injury,
both as relates to the defects and omissions of my early
education and the evil of my subsequent habits. From
never having studied hard at any time, no solid foundation
of knowledge has ever been laid, my subsequent reading has
been desultory and very nearly useless. I have attacked
various subjects as I have been prompted thereto by
curiosity, or vanity, or shame, but I have never mastered
any of them, and the information I have obtained has been
like a house built without a foundation, which the first gust
of wind would blow down and scatter abroad. Really to
master a subject, we should begin at the beginning, storing
the memory with consecutive facts, reasoning and reflecting
upon them as we go along, till the whole subject is digested,
comprehended, made manageable and producible at will;
but then, for this process, the mind must be disciplined, and
there must be a power of attention undiverted, and of continuous
application; but if the eyes travel over the pages of
a book, while the mind is far away upon Newmarket Heath,
and nothing but broken fragments of attention are bestowed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
upon the subject before you, whatever it may be, the result
can only be useless imperfect information, crude and superficial
ideas, constant shame, and frequent disappointment
and mortification. Nothing on earth can make up for the
valuable time which I have lost, or enable me to obtain that
sort of knowledge, or give me those habits which are only to
be acquired early in life, when the memory is fresh and
vigorous, and the faculties are both lively and pliant; but
that is no reason why I should abandon the design of improvement
in despair, for it is never too late to mend, and a
great deal may yet be done.</p>

Brougham delivered a tremendous philippic of
three hours. The Duke of Wellington made a very noble
speech, just such as it befitted him to make at such a
moment, and of course it bitterly mortified and provoked
the Tories, who would have had him make a party question
of it, and thought of nothing but abusing, vilifying, and
embarrassing the Government. This was what Peel showed
every disposition to do in the House of Commons, where he
made a poor, paltry half-attack, which was much more to
the taste of his party than the Duke&rsquo;s temperate and candid
declaration.</p>

<p>Lord Eldon died last week full of years and wealth. He
had for some time past quitted the political stage, but his
name was still venerated by the dregs of that party to whom
consistent bigotry and intolerance are dear. Like his more
brilliant brother, Lord Stowell, he was the artificer of his
own fortune, and few men ever ran a course of more
unchequered prosperity. As a politician, he appears to have
been consistent throughout, and to have offered a determined
and uniform opposition to every measure of a Liberal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
description. He knew of no principles but those (if they
merit the name of principles) of the narrowest Toryism and
of High Church, and as soon as more enlarged and enlightened
views began to obtain ascendency, he quitted (and for
ever) public life. I suppose he was a very great lawyer, but
he was certainly a contemptible statesman. He was a very
cheerful, good-natured old man, loving to talk, and telling
anecdotes with considerable humour and point. I remember
very often during the many tedious hours the Prince Regent
kept the Lords of the Council waiting at Carlton House,
that the Chancellor used to beguile the time with amusing
stories of his early professional life, and anecdotes of celebrated
lawyers, which he told extremely well. He lived
long enough to see the overthrow of the system of which he
had been one of the most strenuous supporters, the triumph
of all the principles which he dreaded and abhorred, and the
elevation of all the men to whom, through life, he had been
most adverse, both personally and politically. He little expected
in 1820, when he was presiding at Queen Caroline&rsquo;s
trial, that he should live to see her Attorney-General on
the Woolsack, and her Solicitor-General Chief Justice of
England.</p>

<h3>London, January 28th, 1838</h3>

<p>I came to town on Wednesday
night, and have been laid up with the gout ever since.
Found all things prepared for a fight in the House of Commons
on Thursday, upon Peel&rsquo;s two amendments to the
Canada Bill. The Tories had mustered in large force, and
the Irishmen had not arrived, so that there was a very good
chance of the Government being beaten. In this emergency
Edward Ellice made a very convenient and dexterous speech,
in which he begged Lord John Russell, for the sake of unanimity,
to give way. Lord John said he would consult his
colleagues and give an answer the next day. It was clear
enough what he would do, and accordingly he came down
the next day, and amidst shouts of triumph, and what was
intended for ridicule from the Tory mob, announced his intention
to accept both amendments. Peel next fell upon the
Instructions to Durham, which he treated very scornfully,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and predicted that they would be compelled to withdraw
them. The Tories were in high dudgeon with the Duke at
his speech in the House of Lords, which they showed in a
sort of undergrowl and with rueful faces, for they stand in
awe of the great man, and don&rsquo;t dare openly to remonstrate
with him or blame his actions. There is no doubt that his
speech was essentially serviceable to the Government, and
upset one of the most promising topics of its opponents.
Francis Egerton came up from the Carlton Club to his own
home after it, and said with deep melancholy that &lsquo;the Duke
had floored the coach,&rsquo; and he described the consternation
and mortification which were prevalent throughout that
patriotic and disinterested society. They were in consequence
the more anxious to urge on Peel to make an
attack of some sort upon the Ministers in the House of Commons,
and he gratified them by moving these amendments, and vilipending the
Instructions.<a name="FNA_02_01" id="FNA_02_01"></a><a href="#FN_02_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It may be questionable
whether it was right to attack the Government upon the
details of their measures when no difference exists between
the opposite parties as to the principle; but granting that
it was, he acted with great skill as a party tactician. He
was certainly right upon every point. The Bill will be improved
by his alterations, and it was equally unnecessary
and ill-judged to lay the Instructions on the table of the
House. The result has been a very clamorous triumph on
the part of the Tories, and a somewhat unlucky exposure of
themselves by the Government; as one of their own friends
(in office) acknowledged to me to-day, they have had &lsquo;to eat
humble pie.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Another debate in the House of Lords
on Friday, and a good one, which will probably finish the
Canadian discussion. Upon this occasion Brougham fired off
another fierce philippic, and was bitterly answered by Melbourne,
who declared war against him once for all. Aberdeen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MODERATION OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON.</span>
made an attack on the Government which he had intended
to make on the first debate; but as the Duke then said
&lsquo;Shall I speak?&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Oh yes, do,&rsquo; expecting the Duke
would make one instead, but was bitterly disappointed when
he heard that moderate speech which gave such offence to
his friends and such comfort to his foes. So on Friday
Aberdeen said what he had intended to say before, and to do
him justice, he made some strong points against the
Government, which told well. He accused them of unnecessary
delay in bringing in this Bill last year, after they had passed
their Resolutions, and asserted that they shuffled it off for
fear they should be inconvenienced thereby in the election
contests which were approaching. I incline to believe this
accusation is well founded, and if so, it was very paltry conduct,
and not an inapt illustration of the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s
famous question during the Reform Bill, &lsquo;How is the
King&rsquo;s Government to be carried on?&rsquo; The King&rsquo;s Government
was not carried on; its interests were neglected or
postponed to the more pressing interest (as they thought,
and I believe thought erroneously) of the party in their election
contests. The Duke of Wellington was expected upon
this occasion to make some amends to his party by explaining
away the exculpatory remarks with which he had before
assisted his opponents. But not a bit: he repeated the same
thing, and made a second speech quite as moderate as his
first. The Duke is therefore incorrigible. My mother told
him the other day how angry they were with him for what
he had said, and he only replied, &lsquo;Depend upon it, it was
true.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I saw a letter yesterday with a very bad account of the state of
Canada.<a name="FNA_02_02" id="FNA_02_02"></a><a href="#FN_02_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
It was to Lord Lichfield from his Postmaster
there, a sensible man, and he describes the beaten
Canadians as returning to their homes full of sullen discontent,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and says we must by no means look upon the flame as
extinguished; however, for the time it has been smothered.
On the other hand, there are the English victorious and exasperated,
with arms in their hands, and in that dangerous
state of mind which is the result of conscious superiority,
moral and intellectual, military and political, but of (equally
conscious) physical&mdash;that is, numerical&mdash;inferiority. It is
the very state which makes men insolent and timid, tyrannical
and cruel; it is just what the Irish Orangemen have
been, and it is very desirable that nothing like them should
exist elsewhere. All this proves that Durham will have no
easy task. It is a curious exhibition of the caprice of men&rsquo;s
opinions when we see the general applause with which
Durham&rsquo;s appointment is hailed, and the admiration with
which he is all at once regarded. Nobody denies that he is
a man of ability, but he has not greatly distinguished himself,
perhaps from having had no fair opportunity to do so.
He has long been looked upon as a man of extreme and
dangerous opinions by the Conservatives, and he never could
agree with the Whigs when he was their colleague; to them
generally he was an object of personal aversion. Latterly
he has been considered the head of the Radical party, and
that party, who are not rich in Lords, and who are not insensible
to the advantage of rank, gladly hailed him as their
chief; but for the last year or two, under the alterative
influence of Russian Imperial flattery, Durham&rsquo;s sentiments
have taken a very Conservative turn, and, though he and the
Radicals have never quarrelled, they could not possibly consider
him to be the same man he was when they originally
ranged themselves under his banner. In public life the
most that can be said for him is, that he cut a respectable
figure. When in office he filled the obscure post of Privy
Seal, and spoke but seldom. He was known, however, to
have had a considerable share in the concoction of the
Reform Bill. The only other public post he has held was
that of Ambassador to Russia, where nobody knows but the
Minister who employed him whether he did well or ill. Now
everybody says he is the finest fellow imaginable, and that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WEAKNESS OF THE GOVERNMENT.</span>
he alone can pacify Canada. Nor do I mean to say he is
unequal to the task he has undertaken, but the opinion of
the world seems oddly produced, and to stand upon no very
solid foundation. If he had continued plain John Lambton I
doubt if he ever would have been thought of for Canada, or
that the choice (if he had been sent there) would have been
so approved. Why on earth is it that an Earldom makes <i>any</i>
difference?</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_02_02" id="FN_02_02"></a><a href="#FNA_02_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
[The actual disturbances in Canada, which had broken out in
November of the preceding year, were terminated in about a month, by the
military operations of Sir John Colborne and Sir Francis Head. The debates
which ensued in England related to the treatment of the prisoners
and the future government of the Canadian provinces.]</p></div>

<p>To return to the Canadian discussions. The Ministers
have on the whole come out of them discreditably. Peel
has worried and mauled them sadly, and taken a tone of
superiority, and displayed a real superiority, which is very
pernicious to a Government, as it tends to deprive them of
the respect and the confidence of the country. Brougham&rsquo;s
harangues in the House of Lords have not done them half
the mischief that Peel&rsquo;s speeches have done them in the
House of Commons, because Peel has a vast moral weight
and Brougham has none. In the conduct of the business
and in their Parliamentary proceedings they committed
errors, especially in the latter, and Peel availed himself of
both with great dexterity and power. The front Treasury
Bench is in a deplorable state. John Russell is without
support; Rice is held cheap and is ineffective; Palmerston
never utters except on his own business; Thomson and
Hobhouse never on any business; and Howick alone ventures
to mix in the fight. The Tories render ample justice to Lord
John under these overwhelming difficulties. Francis Egerton
(one of the keenest of the party) writes to my brother an
account of their recent successes, full of scorn and triumph,
and proud comparisons between the Government and the
Opposition, and he says, &lsquo;John Russell is alone&mdash;a host in
himself I admit; but Rice and Howick, the only colleagues
who did assist him, are gone down in the Parliamentary
estimation a hundred degrees. I certainly admire the spirit
and dexterity of John Russell, and give him credit for great
ability.&rsquo; There is no doubt that the Tories have put themselves
in a better position for getting office, and the Whigs
in a worse for keeping it, than they were in before, because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
impartial men who look at these debates will say that Peel
and his people are the abler practical men, and as time
settles the great questions in dispute, and renders the public
mind more indifferent about those which still remain, there
will be a growing opinion that the direction of affairs ought
to be entrusted to those who display the greatest capacity
to conduct them. The Conservatives besides have the inestimable
advantage of an alliance with the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; the
most vigorous and powerful agent which the press ever
produced. The effect of its articles, stinging as they are,
is irresistible on the public mind, and the Government have
nothing to oppose to such a torrent. It is impossible however,
while admiring the dexterity of Peel in the elaboration
of his offensive measures, to overlook the selfish and unpatriotic
spirit which the great body of the Tories have
manifested throughout the proceedings. If they could have
foregone the bitter pleasure of achieving a party triumph,
and shown themselves ready not only to support the Government
in suppressing the rebellion, but to join with them in
rendering the necessary legislative measures as conducive to
the great object of pacification as they could be made, they
would have covered themselves with honour, and acquired a
credit for noble and public-spirited conduct, which, as it is,
the Duke of Wellington has alone obtained, and which none
of them share with him. Nor do I believe if Peel had
exerted his dexterity and astuteness in another way that he
would have failed to acquire the same moral superiority over
the Ministers by pacific and moderate behaviour, that he has
acquired by hostile motions and taunting language. But
his tail was in a state of furious agitation, and so angry and
dejected at the Duke&rsquo;s forbearance, that he felt himself compelled
to give them the gratification of a triumph of some
sort. To the majority of his followers the Canadian insurrection
was a very pleasing occurrence, and they would have
been overjoyed if the troops had been defeated and Montreal
captured by the rebels. This would indeed have been a fine
case against the Government, and have paved the way for
the return of the Tories to office&mdash;all that they care about.</p>

<p>I suppose all great generals have necessarily
some qualities in common; even Vendôme, an indolent
and beastly glutton and voluptuary, was capable of
prodigious exertions and of activity not to be surpassed.
There is a great deal in the character of Hannibal (as drawn
by Livy) which would apply to the Duke of Wellington;
only, instead of being stained with the vices which are
ascribed to the Carthaginian general, the Duke is distinguished
for the very opposite virtues.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nunquam ingenium idem ad res diversissimas, 1. <i>parendum</i>
atque <i>imperandum</i>, habilius fuit, itaque haud facile
discerneres, utrum imperatori, an exercitui, carior esset:
2. Neque Hasdrubal alium quemquam præficere malle, ubi

[This passage is cited from Livy, lib. xxi. c. iv.]</p></div>

<p>1. Nothing is more remarkable in the Duke than his
habit of prompt obedience to his superiors and employers,
and this shines forth as much when the triumphant Commander-in-Chief
of the Allied armies at the end of the
Spanish war, as in his early campaign in India. He was
always ready to serve when, where, and how his services
were required, and so I believe he is now.</p>

<p>2. In India he was employed by Lord Wellesley and
Lord Lake in all the most important and difficult military
enterprises and civil transactions.</p>

<p>3. Napier says some of Wellington&rsquo;s operations were
daring to extravagance, some cautious to the verge of
timidity, all founded as much upon keen and nice perceptions
of the political measures of his adversaries as upon
pure military considerations&mdash;and &lsquo;he knew how to obey as
well as to command.&rsquo;</p>

<p>4. He told me himself that he was obliged to do everything
in person. His despatches show that he thought of
everything, wrote of everything, directed everything.</p>

<p>5. During the battles of the Pyrenees he slept wrapped
in a cloak, under a thick bush, and the shot fell so near him
that he was urged to remove to a less exposed place.</p>

<p>6. He was always dressed in his plain blue coat; he rode
very good horses.</p>

<p>7. Here ends the parallel and begins the contrast. No
general ever exhibited to the world a nobler example of
mildness and humanity, of the most perfect and invariable
good faith, of severe truth, of inflexible justice, of scrupulous
honesty, of reverence for religion, and regard to the precepts
of morality. Cruelty is not a modern vice; no general is
cruel in these days. I doubt if there has been any great deed
of cruelty committed since the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, the sack
of Magdeburg, and the exploits of Tilly and Pappenheim.
Turenne ravaged the Palatinate, but that was Louvois&rsquo;

cruelty, not Turenne&rsquo;s. There were no military cruelties
perpetrated in the revolutionary wars that I remember.</p>

<h3>February 18th, 1838</h3>

<p>On Thursday night came on the Ballot,
and its advocates divided, as they said they should, 200.
Lord John Russell, though ill, came down and spoke against
it. Peel made a good speech, and complimented John on
his conduct. All the Cabinet Ministers voted against it
except Poulett Thomson, who stayed away. The result is
the creation of a strong impression that the Ballot will
eventually be carried; Brougham says in five
years.<a name="FNA_02_05" id="FNA_02_05"></a><a href="#FN_02_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
There can be no doubt that if the Government had declared a
neutrality, perhaps if John Russell had not so deeply committed
himself against it, it would have been carried now. Some
men in office, many others closely connected with Ministers,
did vote for it; a great number stayed away, and of those
who followed John many did so very reluctantly, and some
certainly will never vote against it again. Then it is
indubitable that the Ballot is getting more popular in the
country, and it is not regarded with much apprehension by
many of those who are altogether opposed to Radical principles:
by such as Fazakerley for instance, a sensible man
and moderate Whig, who did not vote at all on this occasion.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_02_05" id="FN_02_05"></a><a href="#FNA_02_05"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
[It was carried, but in <i>thirty-four</i> years from this time. It is possible
to foresee and predict political events with considerable certainty, but very
difficult to foretell when they will arrive. The division on this occasion, on
Mr. Grote&rsquo;s motion in favour of the Ballot, was 305 to 198.]</p></div>

<p>On Friday night Brougham announced to the Lords that
they must make up their minds to the Ballot after the
division of the preceding night, and yesterday morning, when
we were assembled in my room before going into court
(Parke, Erskine, Bosanquet, and himself) he gave us his
speech in high glee. Parke, who is an alarmist, had just
before said that he had never doubted when the Reform Bill
had passed that England would become a republic, and when
Brougham said that he gave the Ballot five years for its
accomplishment, Parke said, &lsquo;And in five years from that we
shall have a republic,&rsquo; on which Brougham gave him a great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
cuff, and, with a scornful laugh, said, &lsquo;A republic! pooh,
nonsense! Well, but what if there is? <i>There are judges</i> in a
republic, and very well paid too.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well paid!&rsquo; said the
other in the same tone, &lsquo;and no.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, they are; they have
350&#8467;. a year. But, never mind, you shall be taken care of;
I will speak to Grote about you.&rsquo; This is the way he goes on.
He sits every day at the Judicial Committee, but pays very
little attention to the proceedings; he is incessantly in and
out of the room, giving audience to one odd-looking man or
another, and while in court more occupied with preparing
articles for the &lsquo;Edinburgh Review&rsquo; or his Parliamentary
tirades than with the cases he is by way of hearing. The
day after the Lord Advocate&rsquo;s attack upon him in the matter
of the Glasgow cotton-spinners, he received Wakley, and as
he returned (through my room) from the interview, he said,
&lsquo;Do you know who that was? It was Wakley. He would
have felt your head if he had stopped, for he is a great
phrenologist. He examined all the heads of the Glasgow
men, and he said they had none of them the organ of destructiveness
except one.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;then that man
would have committed murder.&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;for the organ
of benevolence was also strongly developed.&rsquo; He is in extraordinary
good humour; in a state of furious mental activity,
troubled neither with fear nor shame, and rejoicing in that
freedom from all ties which renders him a sort of political
Ishmael, his hand against everybody, and everybody against
him, and enables him to cut and slash, as his fancy or his
passion move him, at Whig or Tory, in the House of Lords.</p>

<p>To return from Brougham to the Ballot. It is not so
much the number of 200 who voted for it that demonstrates
the greatness of its progress as the circumstances which
attended the discussion. There can be no doubt that John
Russell&rsquo;s strenuous declaration, besides annoying the Radicals,
greatly embarrassed the Whigs, who had either wholly
or partially committed themselves on the hustings to its
support, and the consequence has been to place the Government
in a false position, for while the opposition to the
Ballot has been called a Government measure (and William
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD JOHN OPPOSES THE BALLOT.</span>
Cowper told me the evening before the division that nobody
could keep his place and vote for Ballot), and many have
been induced to sacrifice their opinions or act against their
professions upon the ground of the necessity of supporting
the Government; many others in office, who were too deeply
pledged to, or too much afraid of their constituents to vote
against it, either voted with Grote, or, what is very nearly
the same thing, absented themselves, and will have done so
with impunity, for the Government cannot turn people out
for voting or non-voting on such a question as this; the proscription
would be too numerous as well as too odious. They
are much too weak for any such stretch of authority and
severity; besides, the Cabinet itself is probably neither
unanimous nor decided in its opposition to the Ballot. John
Russell had, however, spoken out with such determination,
that his honour was irretrievably committed against it, and
accordingly the most strenuous efforts were made, the most
urgent entreaties and remonstrances were employed, to induce
people to support him on this occasion, but with a
success not at all commensurate with these exertions. Vivian
offered to resign, but could not be prevailed on not to
vote.<a name="FNA_02_06" id="FNA_02_06"></a><a href="#FN_02_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
So disgusted was John Russell with the result of this division,
that it was with the greatest difficulty he was prevented
from resigning; and yesterday it was reported all over the
town that he had resigned. It is remarkable that in contemplation
of his resignation, Morpeth is the man talked of
as his successor as leader of the House of Commons, a man
young enough to be the son of half the Cabinet Ministers,
and not in the Cabinet; but in such low estimation are all
Lord John&rsquo;s colleagues, that not one of them is deemed capable
of taking his place in the event of his giving it up. However,
there is not much use in speculating about Lord John&rsquo;s successor
if he secedes, for the whole concern would in that case
inevitably fall to the ground. Indeed, it is not likely that it
will, under any circumstances, go on much longer. When
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
once the leader of the House of Commons has become thoroughly
disgusted and dissatisfied with his position, either
a change or a dissolution of the Government may be anticipated,
and in this case any attempt at change can scarcely
fail to break up this rickety firm.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_02_06" id="FN_02_06"></a><a href="#FNA_02_06"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
Vivian&rsquo;s Cornish petition was signed by 2,100 or 2,200 freeholders,
the same number who had voted for him at the election, but of these there
were 200 who had voted for Eliot.</p></div>

<p>The circumstances which enable them to go on at all I
take to be these: the extreme repugnance of the Queen to
any change, and the necessity in which Melbourne finds
himself on her account to go on as long as he possibly can;
and on the other hand, the reluctance of Peel to assault the
Government in front. I know no more of Peel&rsquo;s opinions
and designs than what I can gather from his conduct and
what he is likely to entertain under present circumstances;
but it must be his object to delay coming into office till he
can do so as a powerful Minister, and till it is made manifest
to Parliament and the country that he is demanded by a
great public exigency, and is not marching in as the result
of a party triumph. If the resignation of the present
Government should take place under any circumstances
which admitted of a reunion of the Whigs and the Radicals,
and of the whole re-united party being held together in
opposition to a Conservative Government, Peel would be
little more secure, and not more able to act with efficiency
and independence than he was in 1835, and this is what he
never will submit to. It is also a great object to him
that the Irish questions should be settled before he comes
into office. Nothing would gladden his heart more than to
have the Government in Ireland established on a footing
from the practice of which he could not deviate, and that
once effected up to a certain point (as far as the Whigs can
go) he would be enabled to go a good deal farther; and as
the man who covers in a building has always more credit
and is considered the artificer more than he who lays the
foundations, so Peel would obtain all the credit of measures
which would in fact have been rendered easy or practicable
by the long-continued toils and perseverance of others. His
interest therefore (and consequently I suppose his design)
is to restrain the impatience of his followers; to let the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">POLICY OF SIR ROBERT PEEL.</span>
Government lose ground in public estimation gently and
considerately, not violently and rancorously; to assist in
putting them in a contemptible or inefficient point of view;
to render their places as uneasy as possible; and to give
them time to crumble to pieces, so that his return to power
may be more in appearance the act of the Whig Ministry
than any act of his own. Then he may demand, and would
probably obtain, as the condition of his acceptance of office,
the support of a large proportion of the moderate of the
Whig party, and the necessity of conciliating such men and
of acquiring their support could afford him an excuse for
adopting those Liberal maxims which, though far from
palatable to the Conservatives, would be indispensable to
the formation of a strong Government, as without their
adoption no Whig could with honour and consistency support
him. I care not who is Minister, but I want to see a
strong Government, one which may have a power of free
action and not be obliged to pick its steps through doubtful
divisions, living from day to day, and compelled to an
incessant calculation as to the probable success of every
measure, whether of principle or detail, on which it ventures
in the House of Commons. Things are not yet ripe for
such a consummation, and before the fresh fusion of parties
takes place which is necessary to bring it about, it must be
made manifest that there is no other alternative, for there
is always a considerable amount of party violence and selfish
interest which reluctantly sacrifice themselves, no matter
how desperate the position they hold or how great the good
which may ensue. Though the adherents of Government
put on as bold a front as they can, there is a very considerable
impression that the days of the Whig Cabinet are
numbered; however, I don&rsquo;t think they will go just yet.</p>

<h3>February 20th, 1838</h3>

<p>I made no allusion to the death of
Creevey at the time it took place, about a fortnight ago,
having said something about him elsewhere. Since that
period he had got into a more settled way of life. He was
appointed to one of the Ordnance offices by Lord Grey, and
subsequently by Lord Melbourne to the Treasurer ship of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Greenwich Hospital, with a salary of 600&#8467;. a year and a
house. As he died very suddenly, and none of his connexions
were at hand, Lord Sefton sent to his lodgings and
(in conjunction with Vizard, the solicitor) caused all his
papers to be sealed up. It was found that he had left a
woman who had lived with him for four years as his mistress,
his sole executrix and residuary legatee, and she accordingly
became entitled to all his personalty (the value of which
was very small, not more than 300&#8467;. or 400&#8467;.) and to all the
papers which he left behind him. These last are exceedingly
valuable, for he had kept a copious diary for thirty-six years,
had preserved all his own and Mrs. Creevey&rsquo;s letters, and
copies or originals of a vast miscellaneous correspondence.
The only person who is acquainted with the contents of
these papers is his daughter-in-law, whom he had frequently
employed to copy papers for him, and she knows how much
there is of delicate and interesting matter, the publication
of which would be painful and embarrassing to many people
now alive, and make very inconvenient and premature revelations
upon private and confidential matters.... Then
there is Creevey&rsquo;s own correspondence with various people,
especially with Brougham, which evidently contains things
Brougham is anxious to suppress, for he has taken pains to
prevent the papers from falling into the hands of any person
likely to publish them, and has urged Vizard to get possession
of them either by persuasion, or purchase, or both.
In point of fact they are now in Vizard&rsquo;s hands, and it is
intended by him and Brougham, probably with the concurrence
of others, to buy them of Creevey&rsquo;s mistress,
though who is to become the owner of the documents, or
what the stipulated price, and what their contemplated
destination, I do not know. The most extraordinary part
of the affair is, that the woman has behaved with the utmost
delicacy and propriety, has shown no mercenary disposition,
but expressed her desire to be guided by the wishes and
opinions of Creevey&rsquo;s friends and connexions, and to concur
in whatever measures may be thought best by them with
reference to the character of Creevey, and the interests and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MR. CREEVEY&rsquo;S PAPERS.</span>
feelings of those who might be affected by the contents of
the papers. Here is a strange situation in which to find a
rectitude of conduct, a moral sentiment, a grateful and disinterested
liberality which would do honour to the highest
birth, the most careful cultivation, and the strictest principle.
It would be a hundred to one against any individual in
the ordinary rank of society and of average good character
acting with such entire absence of selfishness, and I
cannot help being struck with the contrast between the
motives and disposition of those who want to get hold of
these papers, and of this poor woman who is ready to give
them up. They, well knowing that, in the present thirst for
the sort of information Creevey&rsquo;s journals and correspondence
contain, a very large sum might be obtained for them, are
endeavouring to drive the best bargain they can with her for
their own particular ends, while she puts her whole confidence
in them, and only wants to do what they tell her she
ought to do under the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>General Evans&rsquo;s appointment as K.C.B. has made a great
stir at the United Service Club, and is blamed or ridiculed
by everybody. It is difficult to conceive why the Government
gave it him, and if he had not been a vain coxcomb,
he would not have wished for it; but they say he fancies
himself a great general, and that he has done wonders in
Spain.<a name="FNA_02_07" id="FNA_02_07"></a><a href="#FN_02_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

[Sir De Lacy Evans probably did as much in Spain as it was possible
to do with the troops under his command. But in justice to him as an officer
it should be remembered that he commanded a division of the British army
in the Crimea, long afterwards, and showed considerable foresight and
ability at the battles of the Alma and Inkerman.]</p></div>

<p>We have had Brougham every day at the Council Office,
more busy writing a review of Lady Charlotte Bury&rsquo;s book
than with the matter before the Judicial Committee. He
writes this with inconceivable rapidity, seldom corrects, and
never reads over what he has written, but packs it up and
despatches it rough from his pen to Macvey Napier. He is
in exuberant spirits and full of talk, and certainly marvellously
agreeable. His talk (for conversation is not the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
word for it) is totally unlike that of anybody else I ever
heard. It comes forth without the slightest effort, provided
he is in spirits and disposed to talk at all. It is the spontaneous
outpouring of one of the most fertile and restless
of minds, easy, familiar, abundant, and discursive. The
qualities and peculiarities of mind which mar his oratorical,
give zest and effect to his conversational, powers; for the
perpetual bubbling up of fresh ideas, by incapacitating him
from condensing his speeches, often makes them tediously
digressive and long; but in society he treads the ground
with so elastic a step, he touches everything so lightly and
so adorns all that he touches, his turns and his breaks are so
various, unexpected, and pungent, that he not only interests
and amuses, but always exhilarates his audience so as to
render weariness and satiety impossible. He is now coquetting
a little with the Tories, and especially professes great
deference and profound respect for the Duke of Wellington;
his sole object in politics, for the moment, is to badger, twit,
and torment the Ministry, and in this he cannot contain
himself within the bounds of common civility, as he exemplified
the other night when he talked of &lsquo;Lord John this and
Mr. Spring that&rsquo; (on Thursday night), which, however
contemptuous, was too undignified to be effective. He calls
this &lsquo;the Thomson Government&rsquo; from its <i>least</i> considerable
member.</p>

<h3>February 25th, 1838</h3>

<p>Lord John Russell made a very paltry
exhibition on Friday night, quite unworthy of the fame he
had acquired and of the situation he holds. When Lord
Maidstone threatened to bring before the House the language
which O&rsquo;Connell had used (about the perjury in Committees) in a speech at the &lsquo;Crown and
Anchor,&rsquo;<a name="FNA_02_08" id="FNA_02_08"></a><a href="#FN_02_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and gave notice of a motion for that purpose, John jumped up
and said, if he persevered in this motion he would call the
attention of the House to an imputation against the Catholic
members contained in a charge of the Bishop of Exeter
with reference to the oath required of them by the Relief
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">O&rsquo;CONNELL AT THE CROWN AND ANCHOR.</span>
Bill. Whether this was a sally of passion I know not, but
it was puerile, imprudent, and undignified. This charge
was delivered in 1836, and ought to have been animadverted
upon at the time, if at all. It either is, or is not, a proper
matter to bring before the House, but that propriety cannot
be contingent upon some other proceeding of another person,
quite unconnected with it. It was a poor <i>tu quoque</i> which
has got him into a scrape, and will contribute to the downhill
impulsion of the Government; it is a fresh bit of discredit
thrown upon them. John Russell too has been a
personal antagonist of the Bishop of Exeter, and should
have been the last man to attack him in this irregular way.
Out of all this will spring much violence and personality,
and that is what interests the members of the House of
Commons more than any great political question.</p>

[O&rsquo;Connell had asserted, at the &lsquo;Crown and Anchor&rsquo; tavern, that
&lsquo;foul perjury was committed by the Tory Election Committees.&rsquo;]</p></div>

<h3>February 27th, 1838</h3>

<p>It is difficult to conceive a greater
quantity of folly crammed into a short space of time than
has been displayed by all parties in the last three or four
days, and which reached the climax last night in the House
of Commons. It began with O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s speech at the
&lsquo;Crown and Anchor,&rsquo; when he denounced the perjury of
the Tory Election Committees in such terms as he usually
employs. To recommend moderate language to O&rsquo;Connell
would, however, be about as reasonable as to advise him to
drop his brogue; but as he had ample notice that the matter
was coming before the House of Commons, he might have
been persuaded, and there should have been somewhere
sense and prudence enough to persuade him, to soften his
tone, and to make one of those explanations, partly exculpatory
and partly apologetic, which are always accepted as
a sufficient atonement for rash and violent language; instead
of which he brazened it out, and then John Russell came to
his rescue in that foolish and unbecoming notice of his
which compromised his dignity, committed his
party,<a name="FNA_02_09" id="FNA_02_09"></a><a href="#FN_02_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
complicated all the difficulties in which the House itself was
placed. The fools of his party (and on both sides they predominate
in noise and numbers) vociferously cheered this
ill-judged sally, and lauded it as a fine spirited retort. Not
so, however, the more prudent of his friends, who perceived
the dilemma in which he had placed himself. Nobody
in the meantime had any clear notion of what would be
done, what motions would be made or withdrawn, and how
the whole thing was to end. But as the debate promised
a great deal of personality, it was exceedingly attractive, and 517
members<a name="FNA_02_10" id="FNA_02_10"></a><a href="#FN_02_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
went down to the House. Lord Maidstone
moved that O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s speech was a scandalous libel,
and Lord Howick moved the order of the day. O&rsquo;Connell
made a very good speech and then retired; John Russell
spoke on one side, and Peel and Follett on the other, and on
the division the Tories carried the question by nine: 263 to
254. They were of course in a state of uproarious triumph;
the Government people exceedingly mortified, and the tail
in a frenzy. The scene which ensued appears to have been
something like that which a meeting of Bedlam or Billingsgate
might produce. All was uproar, gesticulation, and
confusion. The Irishmen started up one after another and
proclaimed their participation in O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s sentiments,
and claimed to be joined in his condemnation. They were
all the more furious when they found that the conquerors
only meant to have him reprimanded by the Speaker, and
that there was no chance of his or their being sent to Newgate
or the Tower. At last &lsquo;le combat finit faute de combattants,&rsquo;
for John Russell and his colleagues first, and
subsequently Peel and his followers, severally made their
exits something like rival potentates and their trains in a
tragedy, and when the bellowers found nobody left to bellow
to, they too were obliged to move off.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_02_09" id="FN_02_09"></a><a href="#FNA_02_09"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
The notice was that <i>if</i> Lord Maidstone persisted in his motion, he
would call the attention of the Crown to a charge delivered by the Bishop
of Exeter (nearly two years ago), in which he had accused the Catholic
members of perjury and treachery.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_02_10" id="FN_02_10"></a><a href="#FNA_02_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
Many more, I am told, for 517 voted, and several went away who
would not vote.</p></div>

<p>In the House of Lords there had been an early, but very
smart skirmish between Melbourne and
Lyndhurst,<a name="FNA_02_11" id="FNA_02_11"></a><a href="#FN_02_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
in which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD LYNDHURST AND LORD MELBOURNE.</span>
the former drew a contrast between what would have been
the conduct of the Duke (who was absent) and that of Lyndhurst,
and said that the Duke was a man of honour and a
gentleman in a tone which implied that Lyndhurst was
neither. Brougham stepped in and aggravated matters as
much as he could by joining Lyndhurst and taunting Melbourne;
but when Lyndhurst rose again to call Melbourne to
account for his expressions, Brougham held him down with
friendly violence, and (as he asseverates) was entirely the
cause of preventing a fight between them, first by not letting Lyndhurst proceed to
extremities,<a name="FNA_02_12" id="FNA_02_12"></a><a href="#FN_02_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
and next by giving Melbourne
time for reflection. However this may be, when
Lyndhurst asked him, &lsquo;if he meant to say he was not a
man of honour,&rsquo; Melbourne made as ample a retractation
of the offensive expressions as Lyndhurst could desire, and
there the matter ended, not certainly much to the credit or
satisfaction of the Ministers in either House. I think, however,
that the Opposition have obtained a very mischievous
and inconvenient triumph, and that they would have done
much better to leave the question alone. O&rsquo;Connell and John
Russell made better speeches than Peel and Follett, and the
latter seemed to be oppressed by a consciousness of the
narrow, vindictive, and merely party, if not personal grounds
on which the question was raised. They have dragged the
House of Commons into a vote, which, if it acts consistently,
it ought to follow up by an indiscriminate exercise of its
authority and resentment upon all the writers and speakers
who have denounced the Committee system, and they have
procured a resolution declaratory of that being libellous and
scandalous which the public universally believes, and every
member of the House well knows to be true.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_02_11" id="FN_02_11"></a><a href="#FNA_02_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>
The discussion arose out of a question Lyndhurst put about some young
children who had been confined in the penitentiary, in solitary confinement,
&amp;c., <i>without notice</i>. Melbourne fired up at this in a very unnecessary rage,
though Lyndhurst was clearly wrong in not giving notice. Much more
was made of this omission than need have been.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_02_12" id="FN_02_12"></a><a href="#FNA_02_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Lyndhurst was going out of the House to write a hostile note, but
Brougham forced him down and said, &lsquo;I insist on my noble friend&rsquo;s sitting
down,&rsquo; but though he boasts of having been the peacemaker, Lyndhurst told
me he thought, but for Brougham, Melbourne would not have said what he did.</p></div>

<h3>February 28th, 1838</h3>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
I met Lyndhurst yesterday, and had a
few minutes&rsquo; conversation with him. He told me, as I had
conjectured, that Peel was extremely annoyed at all these
proceedings. I said, &lsquo;Why then, did not he stop them?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Because the great misfortune of our party is that he
won&rsquo;t communicate with anybody.&rsquo; So that this most inexpedient
discussion was forced on by the precipitation and
indiscretion of two or three men, against the convictions
and the wishes of the wise and the moderate of all parties;
and when a few words of prudence and conciliation might
have stopped the whole proceeding, pride, or obstinacy, or
awkwardness prevented those words being uttered. The
only real consequence will be that public attention will be
attracted to the Committee system, people will think a great
deal about what they scarcely regarded before, and the
characters of public men will suffer. If the vote of the
House of Commons means anything, it means that these
Committees are honourably and fairly conducted, and it will
be compelled to follow up this vote by reforming them on
the specific ground of enormous and intolerable abuses, the
existence of which their vote will have denied; and all these
results, the self-stultification of the House, and the damage
to the moral reputation of its members, are brought about
in order that the Tory geese may cackle, and that men like
Jemmy Bradshaw and Sir John Tyrrell may wave their hats
and their crutches in
triumph.<a name="FNA_02_13" id="FNA_02_13"></a><a href="#FN_02_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
It is curious enough that
the Ministers had no notion the Tories really meant to press
this matter. John Russell went down (Le Marchant told
me so) fully sensible of his own folly on Friday night, resolved
to drop his motion about the Bishop, and convinced
that, as it was the interest, so it would be the determination,
of the leading Tories to quash the discussion.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_02_13" id="FN_02_13"></a><a href="#FNA_02_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a>
Bradshaw stood up on the benches, huzzaing and waving his hat, and
it was said Sir John Tyrrell (if it was he) did the same, having the gout,
with his crutches.</p></div>

<h3>March 1st, 1838</h3>

<p>Another night (Tuesday) was wasted in a
fresh discussion, brought on by a motion of Pendarves&rsquo;s to
let the matter drop. In the morning Lord Howick told me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD BROUGHAM COURTS THE TORIES.</span>
that the Ministers did not mean to say or do anything more,
and that their only object now was to put an end to the
business as quickly as possible. But John Russell, who is as
little communicative on one side as Peel is on the other, had
in the meantime, and without consulting anybody, desired
Pendarves to make this useless and abortive motion. This
Le Marchant told me yesterday morning, adding how annoyed
they all were at it. Yesterday the Speaker delivered the
reprimand, and they all admitted that it was extremely well
done. O&rsquo;Connell made a violent speech in reply, but clever.</p>

<h3>March 4th, 1838</h3>

<p>Brougham again in the House of Lords on
Friday night. He attacked Pechell and Codrington for having attacked
him<a name="FNA_02_14" id="FNA_02_14"></a><a href="#FN_02_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
because he had abused the Navy in
his Slavery speech, and was very violent, tedious, and verbose.
He informed the House that he had written a remonstrance
to the Speaker for not having called the two sailors
to order, and he treated them with great contumely and abuse in his speech.
Lyndhurst<a name="FNA_02_15" id="FNA_02_15"></a><a href="#FN_02_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
made him very wroth by
asking him &lsquo;if he had any right to write to the Speaker,&rsquo;
and Melbourne made a short, but very good reply, reminding
him that, as he had chosen to publish his speech in the
shape of a pamphlet, it was no breach of privilege to comment
on its contents. He made a great splutter, but got
the worst of this bout. In the meantime he continues to be
the great meteor of the day; he has emerged from his seclusion,
and is shining a mighty luminary among the Tory <i>ignes
minores</i>. The Conservatives are so charmed with him, that
they court his society with the liveliest demonstrations of
regard, and he meets their advances more than half way.
They are very naturally delighted with his unrivalled agreeableness,
and they are not sorry to pat him on the back as a
<i>flagellifer</i> of the Ministers; but though they talk with expressions
of regret of his having radicalised himself, and he
would probably, if he saw an opening, try to wriggle himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
out of Radicalism and into Toryism, they will take care, in
the event of their return to office, not to let such a firebrand
in amongst them. He calls his last Anti-slavery speech his
&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#963;&#964;&#949;&#966;&#8049;&#957;&#959;&#965;,
for he thinks it his greatest effort, and it
was such an oration as no other man could have delivered.
The Bishop of Exeter spoke for two hours and a half the
other night on Catholic oaths, but the whole bench of
Bishops, except Llandaff, stayed away, to mark their disapprobation
of his agitation on the subject.</p>

Molesworth&rsquo;s motion on
Tuesday;<a name="FNA_02_16" id="FNA_02_16"></a><a href="#FN_02_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
they have kept an ominous
silence, and it is believed that the great body of them
are eagerly pressing for a division against the Government,
while the leaders want to restrain them, and not meddle
with the question. Care, however, has been taken, to abstain
from any expression of opinion or declaration of intention,
and they are all ordered to be at their posts. The Whigs
would desire nothing better, end as it might, than that the
Tories should support Molesworth&rsquo;s motion, or move an
amendment upon it, which might bring about the concurrence
with themselves of the mover and the few Liberals
(some say seven, some eleven) who will vote with him.</p>

[Sir William Molesworth moved a vote of censure on Lord Glenelg,
Colonial Secretary of State, on the 6th of March, but withdrew it after two
nights&rsquo; debate in favour of an amendment moved by Lord Sandon, condemning
the Canadian policy of the Government. On the division Ministers had
316, and their opponents 287 votes. The character and purport of this
amendment are explained below.]</p></div>

<h3>March 6th, 1838</h3>

<p>Great interest yesterday to know the result
of the meeting at Peel&rsquo;s, when it was to be settled what
course should be taken to-night. There were meetings at
both Peel&rsquo;s and John Russell&rsquo;s. The decision of the Tories
was deferred till Stanley&rsquo;s arrival in town, who had been
detained by illness at Knowsley. In the morning there was
a meeting of the Privy Council about municipal charters,
when John Russell and Poulett Thomson told me they did
not expect the Tories would give them battle; but if there
was a division, they thought Government would carry it by
20, a great majority in these days.</p>

<h3>March 8th, 1838</h3>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD BROUGHAM&rsquo;S ANTI-SLAVERY SPEECH.</span>
Sandon moved the amendment on Tuesday
night, but so well had the Tories kept their secret that
nobody knew what they were going to do till he got up in
the House. As there were above 200 present at the meeting,
and nearly 300 must have been in the secret, their discretion
was marvellous. I was convinced that no amendment would
be moved, and was completely mistaken. The debate on
Tuesday was moderate; Labouchere spoke well, Stanley
middling, but he was not in force physically. Last night
they divided at half-past two, and there was a majority of
29: all things considered, a great one, and which sets the
Government on its legs for the present. Fourteen of the
Conservatives were absent from illness or the death of relations,
so that the strength of the party really amounts to
300 if it would all be mustered. There must always be some
casualties, and probably there were some likewise on the
other side.</p>

<p>On Tuesday night Brougham made another great Slavery
speech in the House of Lords, as usual, very long, eloquent,
powerful; but his case overstated, too highly wrought, and
too artificial. It was upon the Order in Council by which
coolies were brought into Antigua from India. He made
out a case of real or probable abuse and injustice, and his
complaint was that the Government had not sufficiently
guarded against the contingency by regulations accompanying
the Order. He was followed by several of the Tory
Lords; but the Duke of Wellington refused to support him,
provided Melbourne would agree to adopt certain rules
which he proposed as a security against future abuses, in
which case he said he would move the previous question.
Melbourne agreed, and the Duke moved it. As he and the
bulk of his followers joined with the Government, they had
a large majority, but Ellenborough, Lyndhurst, Wharncliffe,
the Bishop of Exeter, and a few more, voted with Brougham,
and the whole party would have been very glad to do so if
the Duke would have let them. Brougham was exceedingly
disconcerted, and threw out all sorts of baits to catch the
Duke&rsquo;s vote and support, but did not succeed, and he said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
that the Duke had again stepped in to save the Government.
The &lsquo;Times&rsquo; yesterday morning made a very sulky allusion
to what they consider his ill-timed moderation; but he will
not be a party to anything that has the semblance of faction,
and to worrying and bullying the Government merely to
show the power or to have the pleasure of doing so. In the
present instance, although Melbourne gave way to the Duke
(as he could not do less), it so happens that the Government
would have been in a majority of three or four if the Duke
had divided against them, for the Tories had taken no pains
to bring their people down, and Brougham&rsquo;s great orations
are not so attractive to the Lords as they are popular with
the public. He will certainly gain a great deal of reputation
and popularity by his agitation of the Anti-slavery
question, for it is a favourite topic in the country. Wharncliffe
told me he walked away with him from the House
after the debate on Tuesday, and some young men who had
been below the bar saluted him as he went by with &lsquo;Bravo,
Brougham!&rsquo;</p>

<h3>March 9th, 1838</h3>

<p>At the Council yesterday everybody was
very merry and grinning from ear to ear, mightily elated with
their victory, or perhaps rather their escape the night before,
and at having got such a timely reprieve. The division has
given them a new lease, but whether it will prove a long or
a short one depends upon a thousand contingencies. The
violent Tories were sulky and disappointed, though in the
course of Wednesday they began to find out that Government
would have a better division than either party had
anticipated. I had been strongly of opinion that Peel would
not fight the battle, and I thought it would be bad policy
in him to do so; but any opinion contrary to his must be
entertained with diffidence, so able as he is, and so versed in
parliamentary and party tactics; and in order to form a
correct judgement of the course which it was expedient for
him to adopt, it was necessary to know both his own views
as to office at the present moment and the disposition of the
party he leads.</p>

<p>I had no communication with any of the Tories before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SIR ROBERT PEEL&rsquo;S TACTICS.</span>
the division, but yesterday I saw George Dawson, Peel&rsquo;s
brother-in-law, and Francis Egerton. From them I learnt,
what I had all along supposed to be the case, that Peel
was driven with extreme reluctance into fighting this battle;
that it was difficult to take no part in the discussion
raised by Molesworth&rsquo;s inconvenient resolution, and that he
was continually urged and pressed by his followers to attack
the Government, they persisting in the notion that the
Ministers might be driven out, and always complaining
that the moderation of the Duke and the backwardness of
Peel alone kept them in their places. The discontent and
clamour were so loud and continued that it became absolutely
necessary for Peel, if he meant to keep the party
together, to gratify their impatience for action, and he
accordingly concocted this amendment in such terms as
should make it impossible for the Radicals to concur in it,
it being his especial care to avoid the semblance of any
union, even momentary, between the Tories and them. Peel
certainly never expected to beat the Government, nor did he
wish it. There can be no doubt that he saw clearly all the
results that would follow his defeat, and thought them on
the whole desirable. These results are, that there is an
end for the present of any question of the stability of the
Government. Peel has complied with the wishes of his
party, and has demonstrated to them that they cannot turn
the Government out, which will have the effect of moderating
their impatience and induce them for the future to
acquiesce in his managing matters according to his own
discretion. On the other hand, he has exhibited a force of
317 Conservatives<a name="FNA_02_17" id="FNA_02_17"></a><a href="#FN_02_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
in the House of Commons, not only by
far the most numerous Opposition that ever was arrayed
against a Government, but possessing the peculiar advantage
of being united in principle&mdash;a compact, cemented body, all
animated with one spirit, and not a mass composed of different
elements and merely allied and conjoined in hostility
to the Government. The relative strength of the two parties
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
has been manifested by this division, and the Government
have a majority of twenty votes, which, as their people
attend better than the others, may be considered equal to a
working majority of thirty.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_02_17" id="FN_02_17"></a><a href="#FNA_02_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a>
[The number of Conservatives who took part in the vote was 287;
but thirty members of the party either paired or were absent.]</p></div>

<p>This is sufficient to enable them to go on, but the majority
consists of a combination of heterogeneous materials:
of O&rsquo;Connell and the Irish members, of Radicals and Whigs
of various shades and degrees of opinions, all with a disposition,
greater or less, but with different (and often opposite
and inconsistent) views and objects, to support the present
Government, and containing in itself all the seeds of dissolution
from the variety and incompatibility of its component
elements. But while this division has given present security
to the Government, it has also made a display of Conservative
power which will render it impossible for the Whigs to
conduct the Government on any but Conservative principles;
and while, on the one hand, Peel can say to the violent
Tories that they have seen the impotence of their efforts,
and ought to be convinced that by firmness and moderation
they may do anything, but by violence nothing, on the other,
Melbourne and John Russell may equally admonish the
Radicals of the manifest impossibility of carrying out their
principles in the teeth of such a Conservative party, besides
the resistance that would be offered by all the Conservative
leaven which is largely mixed up in the composition of their
own. Thus there is a reasonable expectation that from the
balance of party power moderate counsels may prevail, and
that Conservative principle may extend and consolidate its
influence.</p>

<p>The Queen was very nervous at the possibility there
seemed to be that the Ministers might be beaten, for Lord John
Russell had told her that he could not count upon a majority
of more than fifteen, and she looked yesterday as cheerful as
anybody else around her. With regard to the measure on
the part of the Tories and the case of Canada, they were
wholly unjustifiable in moving such a vote of censure, and
there is nothing in the case (however in its details objections
may be urged against Lord Glenelg&rsquo;s conduct) to demand so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">A DINNER AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE.</span>
strong a proceeding. The best speeches were Sir George
Grey&rsquo;s on one side, and Peel&rsquo;s on the other. The casualties
in the division were, on the whole, unfavourable to the
Tories; fifteen of their people were unavoidably absent, not
above half as many of the Government. They contrived to
delay the report of the Belfast Committee, unseating both
the sitting members, till yesterday morning, by which means
the Government got both their votes in the division; and one
of them being paired off with Lord Ramsay, who was not
there, the pair cancelled by the call of the House, this alone
made a difference of five votes.</p>

<h3>March 11th, 1838</h3>

<p>I dined yesterday at the Palace, much to
my surprise, for I had no expectation of an invitation.
There was a very numerous party:&mdash;the Hanoverian Minister
Baron Münchhausen, Lord and Lady Grey, the Chancellor,
the Roseberys, Ossulston, Mahon, &amp;c. We assembled in the
round room next the gallery, and just before the dinner was
ready the Queen entered with the Duchess of Kent, preceded
by the Chamberlain, and followed by her six ladies. She
shook hands with the women, and made a sweeping bow to
the men, and directly went in to dinner, conducted by
Münchhausen, who sat next to her, and Lord Conyngham
on the other side. The dinner was like any other great
dinner. After the eating was over, the Queen&rsquo;s health was
given by Cavendish, who sat at one end of the table, and
everybody got up to drink it: a vile, vulgar custom, and,
however proper it may be to drink her health elsewhere, it
is bad taste to have it given by her own officer at her own
table, which, in fact, is the only private table it is ever
drunk at. However, this has been customary in the two last
reigns. George III. never dined but with his family, never
had guests, or a dinner <i>party</i>.</p>

<p>The Queen sat for some time at table, talking away very
merrily to her neighbours, and the men remained about a
quarter of an hour after the ladies. When we went into
the drawing-room, and huddled about the door in the sort of
half-shy, half-awkward way people do, the Queen advanced to
meet us, and spoke to everybody in succession, and if everybody&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
&lsquo;palaver&rsquo; was as deeply interesting as mine, it would
have been worth while to have had Gurney to take it down
in short-hand. The words of kings and queens are precious,
but it would be hardly fair to record a Royal after-dinner colloquy....
After a few insignificant questions and answers,&mdash;gracious
smile and inclination of head on part of Queen,
profound bow on mine, she turned again to Lord Grey.
Directly after I was (to my satisfaction) deposited at the
whist table to make up the Duchess of Kent&rsquo;s party, and all
the rest of the company were arranged about a large round
table (the Queen on the sofa by it), where they passed about
an hour and a half in what was probably the smallest
possible talk, interrupted and enlivened, however, by some
songs which Lord Ossulston sang. We had plenty of instrumental
music during and after dinner. To form an opinion
or the slightest notion of her real character and capacity
from such a formal affair as this, is manifestly impossible.
Nobody expects from her any clever, amusing, or interesting
talk, above all no stranger can expect it. She is very civil
to everybody, and there is more of frankness, cordiality, and
good-humour in her manner than of dignity. She looks and
speaks cheerfully: there was nothing to criticise, nothing
particularly to admire. The whole thing seemed to be dull,
perhaps unavoidably so, but still so dull that it is a marvel
how anybody can like such a life. This was an unusually
large party, and therefore more than usually dull and formal;
but it is much the same sort of thing every day. Melbourne
was not there, which I regretted, as I had some curiosity to
see Her Majesty and her Minister together. I had a few
words with Lord Grey, and soon found that the Government
are in no very good odour with him. He talked
disparagingly of them, and said, in reference to the recent
debate, that &lsquo;he thought Peel could not have done otherwise
than he did.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>March 17th, 1838</h3>

<p>Went to the Royal Institution last night
in hopes of hearing Faraday lecture, but the lecture was
given by Mr. Pereira upon crystals, a subject of which he
appeared to be master, to judge by his facility and fluency;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MEN OF SCIENCE.</span>
but the whole of it was unintelligible to me. Met Dr.
Buckland and talked to him for an hour, and he introduced
me to Mr. Wheatstone, the inventor of the electric telegraph,
of the progress in which he gave us an account. I wish I
had turned my attention to these things and sought occupation
and amusement in them long ago. I am satisfied that,
apart from all considerations of utility, or even of profit,
they afford a very pregnant source of pleasure and gratification.
There is a cheerfulness, an activity, an appearance of
satisfaction in the conversation and demeanour of scientific
men that conveys a lively notion of the <i>pleasure</i> they derive
from their pursuits. I feel ashamed to go among such
people when I compare their lives with my own, their knowledge
with my ignorance, their brisk and active intellects
with my dull and sluggish mind, become sluggish and feeble
for want of exercise and use.</p>

<h3>March 20th, 1838</h3>

<p>Met Croker on Sunday, who came to speak
to me about the picture of the Queen&rsquo;s First Council on her
accession which Wilkie is painting. He is much scandalised
because the Lord Mayor is introduced, which he ought not
to be, and Croker apprehends that future Mayors will found
upon the evidence of this picture claims to be present at the
Councils of future sovereigns on similar occasions. I wrote
to Lord Lansdowne about it and told him that it so happens
that I caused the Lord Mayor to be ejected, who was
lingering on in the room after the Proclamation had been
read.<a name="FNA_02_18" id="FNA_02_18"></a><a href="#FN_02_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_02_18" id="FN_02_18"></a><a href="#FNA_02_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a>
[It is a vulgar error, which it would scarcely be necessary to notice
here except for the purpose of correcting it, that the Lord Mayor of London
has some of the privileges of a Privy Councillor during his year of office.
The mistake has probably arisen from his being styled &lsquo;Right Honourable,&rsquo;
but so are the Lord Mayors of Dublin and of York. But he has none of the
rights of a Privy Councillor. He is, however, summoned to attend the
Privy Council at which a new Sovereign is proclaimed, but having heard
the Proclamation he retires before the business of the Council is commenced.
See <i>infra</i>, March 27th.]</p></div>

<p>It is a very trite observation, that no two people are
more different than the same man at different periods of his
life, and this was illustrated by an anecdote Lord Holland
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
told us of Tom Grenville last night&mdash;Tom Grenville, so mild,
so refined, adorned with such an amiable, venerable, and
decorous old age. After Lord Keppel&rsquo;s acquittal there
were riots, and his enthusiastic friends with a zealous mob
attacked the houses of his enemies; among others they
assaulted the Admiralty, the chiefs of which were obnoxious
for their supposed ill-usage of him. The Admiralty was
taken by storm, and Tom Grenville was the second man who
entered at the breach!</p>

<h3>March 23rd, 1838</h3>

<p>On Wednesday I attended a Levée and
Council. The Queen was magnificently dressed, and looked
better than I ever saw her. Her complexion is clear and
has the brightness of youth; the expression of her eyes is
agreeable. Her manner is graceful and dignified and with
perfect self-possession. I remarked how very civil she was
to Brougham, for she spoke to him as much as to anybody.
He was in high good-humour after it.</p>

<p>Yesterday we had a Judicial Committee, with a great judicial
attendance: the Chancellor, Lord Lyndhurst, Brougham,
the Vice-Chancellor, Lord Abinger, Lord Langdale, and
Tom Erskine, with the Lord President. It was to consider
a petition of certain apprentices in British Guiana, who
wanted to stay execution of the judgement of a Court there.
Glenelg had it referred to the Privy Council Committee in
order to shift the responsibility from himself. He expected
that Brougham would get hold of the case and make a clatter
about it; but at the Board Brougham treated it purely
upon legal grounds, and was adverse to the prayer of the
petition.</p>

<p>They had come (i.e., the Chancellor, Lyndhurst, and
Brougham) from the House of Lords, where they had been
reversing Lyndhurst&rsquo;s famous judgement in &lsquo;Small <i>v.</i> Attwood.&rsquo;
Lyndhurst was very hoarse, having just made a long
speech in support of his former judgement; but the Chancellor
and Devon had spoken against, and Brougham was
prepared to side with them. <i>Sic transit gloria!</i> It was this
judgement which was so lauded and admired at the time, and
upon which, more than upon any other, or even upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE QUEEN&rsquo;S ATTACHMENT TO WILLIAM IV.</span>
general tenor of his decisions, Lyndhurst&rsquo;s great judicial
fame was based; and now it turns out that, although it was
admirable in the execution, it was bad in point of
law.<a name="FNA_02_19" id="FNA_02_19"></a><a href="#FN_02_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_02_19" id="FN_02_19"></a><a href="#FNA_02_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a>
[The main question in the celebrated case of Small <i>v</i>. Attwood was
whether the sale of certain ironworks in Staffordshire, by Mr. Attwood, to
the British Iron Company, should be set aside for what, in the Courts of
Equity, is termed fraud. Lord Lyndhurst, as Chief Baron of the Exchequer,
held that an amount of misrepresentation had been practised by the vendor,
which annulled the sale. The House of Lords was of opinion that if the
purchasers had paid too much for the property, it was their own fault.
This decision rested, of course, on the special circumstances of the case. It
was argued with great ability by Serjeant Wilde and Mr. Sugden, who received
fees in this case to an amount previously unknown to the Bar. It is
remarkable that Lord Lyndhurst sat on the appeal from his own judgement
and supported it; the fifth vote, which decided the case, was that of Lord
Devon, who had never held a judicial office.]</p></div>

<h3>March 25th, 1838</h3>

<p>Lady Cowper told me yesterday that the
Queen said to Lord Melbourne, &lsquo;the first thing which had
convinced her he was worthy of her confidence was his conduct
in the disputes at Kensington last year about her proposed
allowance,&rsquo; in which, though he knew that the King&rsquo;s life
was closing, he had taken his part. She considered this to
be a proof of his honesty and determination to do what he
thought right. Though she took no part, and never declared
herself, it is evident that she, in her heart, sided with the
King on that occasion. It is difficult to attribute to timidity
that command over herself and passive obedience which
she showed in her whole conduct up to the moment when
she learnt that she was Queen; and from that instant, as if
inspired with the genius and the spirit of Sixtus V., she at
once asserted her dignity and her will. She now evinces in
all she does an attachment to the memory of her uncle, and
it is not to be doubted that, in the disputes which took
place between him and her mother, her secret sympathies
were with the King; and in that celebrated scene at Windsor,
when the King made so fierce an attack upon the Duchess&rsquo;s
advisers, and expressed his earnest hope that he might live
to see the majority of his niece, Victoria must have inwardly
rejoiced at the expression of sentiments so accordant with
her own. Her attentions and cordiality to Queen Adelaide,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
her bounty and civility to the King&rsquo;s children, and the disgrace
of Conroy, amply prove what her sentiments have all
along been.</p>

<h3>March 27th, 1838</h3>

<p>Went yesterday to sit to Wilkie for the
picture of the Queen&rsquo;s First Council. The likenesses are
generally pretty good, but it is a very unfaithful representation
of what actually took place. It was, of course, impossible
to preserve all the details without sacrificing the
effect, but the picture has some glaring improprieties, which
diminish its interest, and deprive it of all value as an historical
piece. There were ninety-seven Privy Councillors present
on the occasion, and among them most of the conspicuous
men of the time. He has introduced as many figures as he
well could, but has made a strange selection, admitting very
ordinary men, such as Lord Burghersh and Lord Salisbury,
while Brougham and Stanley do not find places. He told
me that great anxiety prevailed to be put into this picture,
and many pressing applications had been made; and as only
vain and silly men would make them, and importunity generally
prevails to a great extent, it ends in the sacrifice of the
picture by substituting these undistinguished intruders in
place of the celebrated persons who are so much better entitled
to be there. Then he has painted the Lord Mayor of
London and the Attorney-General, who, not being Privy
Councillors, could not be present when the Queen was
sitting in Council; but they both entreated to be put in
the picture, and each asserted that he was actually present.
Yesterday I remonstrated with Wilkie, who had no good
reason to give; indeed, none, except that they both <i>said</i>
they were present, and that the Attorney had described to
him what passed. The fact was this: when the Lords
assemble they order the Queen to be proclaimed, and when
the Proclamation is read the doors are thrown open, and
everybody is admitted. The Lord Mayor came in together
with several Common Councilmen and a multitude of other
persons. When this is over they are all obliged to retire, and
I called out from the head of the table that &lsquo;everybody
except Privy Councillors would have the goodness to retire.&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WILKIE&rsquo;S PICTURE OF THE FIRST COUNCIL.</span>
It was necessary to clear the room before Her Majesty could
hold her Privy Council. The people did retire, slowly and
lingeringly, and some time afterwards, espying the fur and
scarlet of the Lord Mayor, I requested somebody (I forget
whom) to tell him he must retire, and he did leave the room.
Shortly after the Queen entered, and the business of the
Council commenced. The impossibility of getting the summonses
to two hundred and twenty Privy Councillors conveyed
in time caused the greatest irregularity in the arrivals, and the
door was continually opened to admit fresh comers. In such
a scene of bustle and confusion, and in a room so crowded, it
is extremely probable that the Lord Mayor and the Attorney-General
smuggled themselves back into the apartment, and
that they were (very improperly) spectators of what passed;
but that forms no reason why they should be represented in
an historical picture as actors in a ceremonial with which
they had, and could have, no concern. Wilkie was very
anxious to have Lord Conyngham in the picture, but both
he and Albert Conyngham decided that it would be improper,
because not only he was not present, but according to etiquette
could not be present, as it was his duty to remain in
constant attendance upon the body of the late King up to
the moment of his breaking his wand over his coffin.</p>

<p>Yesterday Brougham spoke for four hours and a half in
the House of Lords, upon the appeal of &lsquo;Small <i>v</i>. Attwood,&rsquo;
concurring with the Chancellor in reversing Lyndhurst&rsquo;s
judgement, and evidently bent upon making a display of
judicial eloquence which should eclipse that of Lyndhurst
himself. This judgement has made a great sensation in the
world, especially in the commercial world. I met the Vice-Chancellor,
who had come from the House of Lords, and
who told me of Brougham&rsquo;s speech, and the final decree;
he said he really knew nothing of the case, but from what
he heard he was inclined to believe the reversal was right.
Lyndhurst, however, persists in the correctness of his own
judgement.</p>

<h3>March 30th, 1838</h3>

<p>Lord Eliot&rsquo;s motion about Spain came to
a ridiculous end on Wednesday. When the debate was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
resumed at five o&rsquo;clock very few people were present; they
were chattering and making a noise; nobody heard the
Speaker when he put the question; and so they divided 72
to 60, the Ministers (or Minister, for none was present but
John Russell) not knowing on which side there would be a
majority. The Tories were very angry, and wanted to renew
the discussion in another form, but after a little wrangle
this project dropped. It was a foolish, useless motion, and
deserved no better end.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon I found Downing Street
thronged with rival deputations of West Indians and
Quakers, which had both been with Melbourne. Out of
Brougham&rsquo;s flaming speeches on Anti-slavery a tempest has
arisen, which threatens the West Indians with sudden and
unforeseen ruin in the shape of immediate
emancipation.<a name="FNA_02_20" id="FNA_02_20"></a><a href="#FN_02_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
It is always easy to get up anti-slavery petitions and to
excite a benevolent indignation against slavery in any shape,
and Brougham has laid hold of this easy mode of inflaming
the public mind in his usual daring, unscrupulous, reckless
style, pouring forth a flood of eloquent falsehoods and misrepresentations
which he knows will be much more effective
than any plain matter-of-fact statements that can be urged
on the other side. The West Indians had no notion they
were in any danger, and were reposing under the shade of
Government protection and in undoubting reliance upon the
inviolability of the great arrangement, when they find themselves
overtaken all at once with the new question of immediate
emancipation which has sprung up into instantaneous
life and strength. Their terror is accordingly great. They
went to Melbourne, who said he agreed with them, and that
the Government was determined to support them, and so
they might tell their people, but that he could not promise
them to make it so much a Government question as to resign
if they were beat upon it. The leaders of the Opposition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BIRTHDAY REFLEXIONS.</span>
equally took their part, but the question is whether the tails
will not beat the heads. I never remember before to have
seen any question on which so much uncertainty prevailed
as to individual votes. More than one half the members
of the House doubted, and probably are at this moment
doubting, how they shall vote. The petitions are innumerable,
and men are disposed to gratify their constituents by
voting as they please on this question, not caring a fig either
for the slaves or the West Indians, and reconciling it to
their consciences to despoil the latter by assuming that
they were overpaid with the twenty millions they got by the
Emancipation Act.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_02_20" id="FN_02_20"></a><a href="#FNA_02_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a>
[Sir George Strickland moved, on the 30th of March, a resolution in
favour of the termination of negro apprenticeship as established by the
Emancipation Act of 1834, on the 1st of August of the current year. The
motion was defeated by 269 to 205.]</p></div>

<h3>April 2nd, 1838</h3>

<p>My birthday. Another year has stolen over
me, and finds me, I fear, little better or wiser than at the
end of the last. How we wince at our reflexions and still
go on in the same courses! how we resolve and break our
resolutions! It is a common error to wish we could recall
the past and be young again, and swear what things we
would do if another opportunity was offered us. All vanity,
folly, and falsehood. We <i>should</i> do just the same as before,
because we <i>do</i> actually do the same; we linger over and
regret the past instead of setting manfully to work to improve
the future; we waste present time in vague and
useless regrets, and abandon ourselves to inaction in despair
instead of gathering up what yet remains of life, and finding
a compensation, however inadequate, in resolute industry
for our losses. I wonder if anybody has ever done this.
Many after damaging their health have become prudent and
careful in restoring their shattered constitutions; many
more have been extravagant and careless, and ended by
being parsimonious and prudent, and so the first have grown
strong and the second rich; but has anybody thoroughly
wasted his time, frittered away his understanding, weakened
the powers of judgement and memory, and let his mind be
bare and empty as the shelves of an unfurnished bookcase,
and afterwards become diligent, thoughtful, reflective, a
hater of idleness, and, what is worse, of indolence, and
habitually addicted to worthy and useful pursuits? I do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
not think I can call to mind any instance of such a
reformation.</p>

<p>I went to Newmarket on Saturday. Mutable as this
climate is, the greatest variation I ever saw was between
Friday and Sunday last. On Friday S.W. wind, balmy air
like June, and the trees beginning to bud; on Sunday the
ground was completely covered with snow, not a particle of
any colour but white to be seen, a bitter N.E. wind, and
so it continued till the sun melted away the thin coat of
snow, which disappeared as suddenly as if it had been swept
away.</p>

<p>The Ministers got a pretty good majority, all things considered,
on Friday. Gladstone made a first-rate speech in
defence of the planters, which places him in the front rank
in the House of Commons, so Fazakerly told me; he converted
or determined many adverse or doubtful votes, as did
Sir George Grey the day before.</p>

<h3>April 5th, 1838</h3>

<p>Lord Charles Fitzroy, Vice-Chamberlain, who
had voted against Government on the Negro question, was
turned out for his vote, not angrily and violently, but it was
signified to him that he must go, and yesterday he came to
Buckingham House, where there was a Council, to resign
his key. They could not do otherwise, for Peel had sent a
message to Lord John Russell to know whether Government
did mean in earnest to oppose this motion with all their
force and influence, because, if they did, he would support
them with as many of his friends as he could bring to their
aid; and the reply was that such was their intention. After
this they could not pass over such a vote in one of their own
household.</p>

<p>The night before last Government had the narrowest
possible escape of being beaten upon a motion of Lord
Chandos&rsquo;s about Lord Durham&rsquo;s
expenses.<a name="FNA_02_21" id="FNA_02_21"></a><a href="#FN_02_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
They carried it by two, and that only because Lord Villiers (Durham&rsquo;s first
cousin, and whose brother is one of his aides-de-camp)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">VOTE ON LORD DURHAM&rsquo;S EXPENSES.</span>
stayed away, together with Dawson Damer, from motives of
personal friendship; Castlereagh, because Durham and
Londonderry are knit together by the closest of all ties,&mdash;a
community of <i>coal</i> interest; and one of the Hopes, because
he is going with his regiment to Canada, and did not choose
to incur the personal animosity of the great man there:
but for these secessions the question would have been
carried. Durham would probably have refused to go, and
it is not impossible the Government might have resigned.
Nobody expected this close division, and the Secretary of
the Treasury was greatly to blame in not securing a larger
attendance of the Government people and guarding against
all chances. However, in these days a miss is as good as a
mile, and such a division, which in former times would have
been fatal to a Government, does not signify a straw, except
as an additional exhibition of weakness and proof of their
precarious tenure of office. Melbourne yesterday looked
very grave upon it, and he had an unusually long audience
of the Queen before the Council. Palmerston treated the
matter with great levity. As generally happens, there is
much to blame in the conduct of all parties. In the first
place the Colonial Minister should have made some arrangement
upon his own responsibility, and not have produced
the ridiculous correspondence with Durham, and nobody
ever before heard of a Minister asking a Governor what establishment
he intended to have. Then Durham might as well
have laid aside his ostentation and grandeur, and have shown
a determination to apply himself manfully to the work entrusted
to him without any desire for pomp and expense.
He would have gone out more effectively, have acquired
more reputation, and have avoided the odium and the ridicule
which now in no small degree attach to his mission.
On the other hand, the Opposition had no business to take
the matter up in this way. In such a momentous affair it
is immaterial whether there is a secretary more or less, and
whether an establishment, which is only to exist for one
year, costs 2,000&#8467;. or 3,000&#8467;. more or less, and to declare
that the sum actually spent by Lord Gosford shall be the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
maximum of Lord Durham&rsquo;s expenditure, is so manifestly
absurd that it proves the pitiful and spiteful spirit in which
the motion was conceived. Suppose they had succeeded,
and that after such a vote Durham (as he well might) had
resigned the appointment. This must have been an enormous
embarrassment to the public service, incurred without
any object of commensurate importance. It is not the least
curious part of this matter that the Government were not
at all sorry that the question of Durham&rsquo;s expenses was
mooted in the House of Commons in order that his extravagance
might be checked; while the Opposition had no
expectation, and probably no desire, to carry a vote upon it
against the Ministers.</p>

[Lord Chandos moved, on the 3rd of April, that the expenditure on
Lord Durham&rsquo;s mission should be limited to 12,000&#8467;., the sum allowed to
Lord Gosford. The resolution was rejected by 160 to 158 votes.]</p></div>

<h3>April 8th, 1838</h3>

<p>It would have been well for Durham if he had
started for Canada the day after he made his speech in the
House of Lords, for he made upon that occasion a very
favourable impression, and the world was disposed to praise
the appointment. Since this his manifestation of a desire
for pomp and grandeur and an expensive display has drawn
ridicule and odium upon him. His temper has been soured
by the attacks both in Parliament and in the press; he has
been stung, goaded, and tormented by the diurnal articles
in the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; and he has now made himself obnoxious to
universal reproach and ridicule by an act which, trifling in
itself, exhibits an <i>animus</i> the very reverse of that which is
required in the pacificator and legislator of Canada. He
was engaged to dine with Bingham Baring on Friday last,
but in consequence of his having voted in the minority the
other night, on Chandos&rsquo;s motion, Durham chose to construe
this vote into a personal offence towards himself, and sent
an excuse saying that &lsquo;he had no alternative.&rsquo; He wrote to
Lady Harriet Baring a very civil note, and conveyed his
motive by implication, but quite clearly. The note was, of
course, handed about for the amusement of the company,
and the story, subsequently, for that of the town.</p>

<h3>April 12th, 1838</h3>

<p>Dined with Lord Anglesey yesterday, to
meet Wolff, the missionary. I had figured to myself a tall,
gaunt, severe, uncouth man; but I found a short, plump,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WOLFF THE MISSIONARY.</span>
cheerful person, with a considerable resemblance to the
Bonaparte family, and with some to old Denon, with one of
the most expressive countenances I ever saw, and so agreeable
as to compensate for very plain features; eyes that
become suddenly illuminated when he is warmed by his
subject, and a voice of peculiar sweetness and power of intonation.
He came prepared to hold forth, with his Bible in
his pocket, and accordingly after dinner we gathered round
him in a circle, and he held forth. It would be no easy
matter to describe a discourse which lasted a couple of
hours, or indeed to say very precisely what it was about. It
was a rambling, desultory reference to his travels and adventures
in fluent and sometimes eloquent language, and not
without an occasional dash of humour and drollery. He
illustrated the truth of the Scriptures by examples drawn
from his personal observation and the habits, expressions,
and belief of the present inhabitants of Palestine, and he
spoke with evident sincerity and enthusiasm. He sang two
or three hymns as specimens of the psalmody now in use at
Jerusalem. The great fault of his discourse was its length
and desultory character, leaving no strong and permanent
impression on the mind. He subsequently gave us a second
lecture upon the Millennium, avowing his belief that it is near
at hand; he &lsquo;hoped and believed that it would take place in
1847,&rsquo; and he proceeded to show that this was to be inferred
from the prophecies of Daniel, and that the numbers in that
book, rightly explained, bore this meaning. He told us that
he had learnt fourteen languages, and had preached in nine.</p>

<h3>May 7th, 1838</h3>

<p>For three weeks past entirely engrossed by
Newmarket, with the same mixed feelings of disgust at
the nature of the occupation, and satisfaction at the success
attending it. I won 2,000&#8467;. by the two weeks, and if I meet
with no reverse am rapidly acquiring the means of paying
off my debts. Then I propose to live not for myself alone
(as I earnestly hope), but that I may feel the desire of contributing
to the enjoyments of others. I hope as I become
rich (and if I get out of debt I shall be rich) I may not
become grasping and avaricious, and acquire a taste for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
hoarding money merely for hoarding&rsquo;s sake. When I see
how insensibly, and under what plausible pretexts, this
passion steals upon others, I tremble lest I should become
a victim to it myself.</p>

<p>I know of nothing, in the world of politics. There has
been much foolish chatter about the Coronation, and whether
there should be a banquet or no; the Tories calling out for
one because the Whig Government have settled that there
should not be any. The Duke of Wellington, as usual,
sensible, and above such nonsense; says it will all do very
well, and that the Palace of Westminster having been
destroyed by fire, a banquet and procession would not be
feasible, as there exist no apartments in which the arrangements
could be made. He rebuked his Tory Lords the other
night when they made a foolish attack on Melbourne about
M&rsquo;Hale signing himself John <i>Tuam</i>. Every day he appears
a greater man.</p>

<p>I have read hardly anything all this time but two
reviews in the &lsquo;Edinburgh&rsquo;&mdash;Brougham&rsquo;s most remarkable
paper upon Lady Charlotte Bury&rsquo;s book, the composition
of which I saw with my own eyes; the other is Stephen&rsquo;s
review of Wilberforce&rsquo;s Life. Nothing can be more admirable
than the characters which Brougham has given of the celebrated
people of that day&mdash;George III., George IV., Eldon,
Perceval, and others; and when I think of the manner in
which they were written, with what inconceivable rapidity,
and in the midst of what occupation&mdash;for his attention was
perpetually divided between what he was writing and what
the counsel was saying&mdash;it is an astonishing exhibition of
facility and fertility. Stephen&rsquo;s review is as good as possible
in a very different style, and his description of the end of
Wilberforce&rsquo;s life strikes me as singularly eloquent and
pathetic.</p>

<h3>May 11th, 1838</h3>

<p>Last night I was at the ball at the Palace&mdash;a
poor affair in comparison with the Tuileries. Gallery
ill-lit; rest of the rooms tolerable. The Queen&rsquo;s manner and
bearing perfect. She danced, first with Prince George,
then young Esterhazy, then Lord FitzAlan. Before supper,
and after dancing, she sat on a sofa somewhat elevated in
the drawing-room, looking at the waltzing; she did not
waltz herself. Her mother sat on one side of her, and
the Princess Augusta on the other; then the Duchesses of
Gloucester and Cambridge and the Princess of Cambridge;
her household, with their wands, standing all round; her
manners exceedingly graceful, and, blended with dignity and
cordiality, a simplicity and good humour, when she talks to
people, which are mighty captivating. When supper was
announced she moved from her seat, all her officers going
before her&mdash;she, first, alone, and the Royal Family following;
her exceeding youth strikingly contrasted with their mature
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
ages, but she did it well. I was struck last night for the
first time with the great change in the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s
looks; others have noted it before. He is no longer so
straight and upright, and old age is taking possession of his
features in a way that is distressing to see. He has lived
long enough for his own renown, but he cannot live long
enough for the good of his country, let what will happen
and when it may. It is a fine sight to regard the noble
manner in which he is playing the last act of his glorious
life.</p>

<p>My brother writes me word from Paris that Leopold is
deadly sick of his Belgian crown, and impatient to abdicate,
thinking that it is a better thing to be an English Prince,
uncle to the Queen, with 50,000&#8467;. a year, than to be monarch
of a troublesome vulgar little kingdom which all its neighbours
regard with an evil or a covetous eye. Louis Philippe
is in a mighty fright about it, and he is right, for Leopold&rsquo;s
abdication would be almost sure to disturb the peace of
Europe. Stanley thinks the peace of Europe will be disturbed,
and that speedily, by the great antagonistic forces of religion
growing out of the Prussian disputes between the Court of
Berlin and the Archbishop of Cologne; this he told me the
other day, and said people were little aware of what a
religious storm was brewing; but his opinions are not to
be trusted very confidently, especially when religion is
concerned in them.</p>

<h3>May 13th, 1838</h3>

<p>The world was astonished by Sir Thomas
Acland giving notice of a motion, which comes on to-morrow,
for expunging from the Journals the famous Appropriation
Resolution which turned out Peel&rsquo;s
Government.<a name="FNA_03_01" id="FNA_03_01"></a><a href="#FN_03_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was doubted at first whether this was a spurt of his own or a concerted
project, but it turns out to have been the latter. The
Government think it a good thing for them, as they count
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE APPROPRIATION CLAUSE MAINTAINED.</span>
upon a certain majority, and I am quite unable to see
the use of such a motion as this, even as a party move.
The Duke of Wellington said, at the end of last Session,
that he wished to meet the Government half way, and
settle the Tithe question, and nothing can be less likely to
promote an adjustment than this attack; but I understand
<i>now</i> they do not wish to settle it, and that they prefer
trusting to the operation of Stanley&rsquo;s Bill, and say there is
no reason for accepting 75 per cent. for the clergy when they
can eventually get the whole. But they had better settle the
question if they possibly can, for experience might have
shown them that if the spirit of resistance and hostility to
the Church is again roused into action, the means of vexing
and impoverishing the clergy will not be wanting, and the provisions
of Stanley&rsquo;s Bill will only have the effect of making
the landlords parties to the contest, who, if they find their
own interests at variance with the interests of the Church,
will not hesitate for a moment in sacrificing the latter. It
is very surprising that Peel should consent to this motion,
and the more so because his speech at the dinner yesterday
is said to have been extremely moderate in all respects.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_03_01" id="FN_03_01"></a><a href="#FNA_03_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
[Upon Lord John Russell bringing in a Bill for settling the Irish Tithe
question, Sir Thomas Acland moved, as a preliminary step to this discussion,
that the celebrated resolution of the 8th of April, 1835, for the appropriation
of the surplus revenues of the Irish Church should be rescinded. Upon
a division the Government proposal was carried by 317 to 298 votes.]</p></div>

<h3>May 18th, 1838</h3>

<p>At Newmarket all the week past. Since I
have been away there was the debate and division on
Acland&rsquo;s motion. The Government talked of 23, and the
Opposition of 15 majority, and it turned just between the
two. It was a very ill-advised measure, and I have no doubt
was forced on Peel against his judgement, and that it was
not approved by the Duke; but the fact is, they cannot
manage their party. Peel&rsquo;s speech was anything but good,
and smacked of unwillingness; Stanley&rsquo;s was very poor;
John Russell&rsquo;s was very good in facts, but ill-judged in some
respects, and it is neither wise nor dignified, nor in good
taste, to keep flinging at the Bishop of Exeter as he does;
Morpeth&rsquo;s was the best, brilliant and effective. Peel said to
him, when they were going out to divide, &lsquo;I can appreciate a
good speech when made against me as well as when it is for
me, and I must tell you that yours was the best speech of the
debate.&rsquo; This was becoming and judicious, and such courtesies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
soften the asperities of Parliamentary warfare. The
Government had much the best of the argument, and the
Tories contrived to afford them a triumph upon the Appropriation
Clause, and at the same time enabled them to shake
it off (onerous and inconvenient as it was) without further
difficulty. There was some ingenuity in doing this. I
cannot help thinking Peel likes to see his party defeated in
this way. The Government think it has been a very great
thing for them, and no doubt it has done them service.
Peel&rsquo;s speech at the banquet was somewhat didactic, and too
much in the style of a political sermon; but it was very
good, full of excellent sense, couched in excellent language,
but it may be doubted if his moderation was palatable to
the majority of his
hearers.<a name="FNA_03_02" id="FNA_03_02"></a><a href="#FN_03_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h3>May 23rd, 1838</h3>

<p>Talleyrand is dead. He died after a short
illness some day last week. It would require a nice discrimination
of character and intimate knowledge of the man
to delineate his, a great deal more of both than I possess,
therefore I shall not attempt it. During the period of his
embassy in England I lived a good deal with him, his house
being always open to me, and I dined there <i>en famille</i> whenever
I pleased. Nothing could be more hospitable, nothing
more urbane and kind than he was; and it was fine to see,
after his stormy youth and middle age, after a life spent in
the very tempest and whirlwind of political agitation, how
tranquilly and honourably his declining years ebbed away.
Still retaining his faculties unimpaired, and his memory
stored with the recollections of his extraordinary and eventful
career, and an inexhaustible mine of anecdotes, his delight
was to narrate, which he used to do with an abundance,
a vivacity, and a <i>finesse</i> peculiar to himself, and to the
highest degree interesting and attractive. No name was
once held in greater detestation in England than that of
Talleyrand. He was looked upon universally as a sink of
moral and political profligacy. Born at the end of Louis XV.&rsquo;s
reign, and bred up in the social pleasures and corruptions of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DEATH OF TALLEYRAND.</span>
that polite but vicious aristocracy, he was distinguished in
his early youth for his successful gallantries, for the influence
he obtained over women, and the dexterity with which
he converted it to his advancement. A debauched abbé
and bishop, one of the champions and then one of the
victims of the Revolution, afterwards (having scrambled
through the perilous period of Terrorism) discarding his
clerical character, he became the Minister of the Consulate
and the Empire, and was looked upon all over Europe as a
man of consummate ability, but totally destitute of principle
in public or in private life. Disgraced by Napoleon, he
reappeared after his fall, and was greatly concerned in the
restoration of the Bourbons. For a short time only employed,
but always treated by them with consideration and respect,
the Revolution of July again brought Talleyrand prominently
on the stage, and, to the surprise of all men, he accepted
the embassy to London. The years he passed here were
probably the most peaceful of his life, and they served to
create for him a reputation altogether new, and such as to
cancel all former recollections. His age was venerable, his
society was delightful, and there was an exhibition of conservative
wisdom, &lsquo;of moderate and healing counsels,&rsquo; in all
his thoughts, words, and actions very becoming to his age
and station, vastly influential from his sagacity and experience,
and which presented him to the eyes of men as a
statesman like Burleigh or Clarendon for prudence, temperance,
and discretion. Here therefore he acquired golden
opinions, and was regarded by all ranks and all parties with
respect, and by many with sincere regard. When he was
attacked in the House of Lords the Duke of Wellington rose
in his defence, and rebuked the acrimony of his own friends.
Talleyrand was deeply affected at this behaviour of the
Duke. I regret much not having availed myself of the
opportunities I might have had to listen to and record the
talk of Talleyrand, but the fact is, he was so inarticulate,
and I so deaf, that the labour would have been greater than
I could go through for the object. The account which my
brother has sent me of the circumstances which preceded his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
death, and of his reconciliation with the Church, are very
curious.<a name="FNA_03_03" id="FNA_03_03"></a><a href="#FN_03_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
He had always desired to die at Valençay, in order
to avoid the scandal which he apprehended there might be
in Paris from the severity of the Archbishop, but it was contrived
to get everything quietly and decently settled, and he
died in peace with the Church, and with all the absolutions
and benedictions that she could have bestowed upon the
most faithful of her sons.</p>

<h3>May 27th, 1838</h3>

<p>Yesterday, at two o&rsquo;clock, died, after a week&rsquo;s
illness, of a low bilious fever, Lady
Harrowby,<a name="FNA_03_04" id="FNA_03_04"></a><a href="#FN_03_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
the oldest and most intimate of my friends, and the woman in the
world for whom I had the greatest respect and regard. My
intercourse with her had been much diminished for many
years past; such changes take place in our social habits
without any cause except those which the lapse of time,
different pursuits, ties, and habits, bring about. There is a
melancholy satisfaction in dwelling upon the noble qualities
which death has extinguished, and the excellence of Lady
Harrowby demands a brief tribute of affection and admiration
from those who, having best known her virtues, have
the greatest reason to deplore, and are best able to appreciate,
her loss. She had a mind of masculine strength united
with a heart of feminine softness; for while she was resolute
and determined, and had firmness and courage to bear up
against the heaviest afflictions, she had no coldness or insensibility
in her temperament, but was endowed with the
tenderest and warmest affections. She was not by nature
imaginative, but her understanding was excellent and utterly
devoid of lumber and affectation. She had the sound
practical sense of a vigorous and healthy mind, without a
particle of vanity or conceit; she never attempted to plunge
out of her depth, or to soar beyond the level of her comprehension
and her knowledge. Her conversation therefore was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CHARACTER OF LADY HARROWBY.</span>
happily described by an old and attached friend and very
competent judge, when he said of it that &lsquo;her talk was so
<i>crisp.</i>&rsquo;<a name="FNA_03_05" id="FNA_03_05"></a><a href="#FN_03_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
She had an even flow of animal spirits, was never
capricious or uncertain, full of vivacity, with a constant but
temperate enjoyment of society; never fastidious or exclusive,
tasting and appreciating excellence without despising
or slighting mediocrity; attentive, affable, and obliging to
all, and equally delighting all, because her agreeableness was
inseparable from her character, and was an habitual and
unceasing emanation from it, rather than the exertion of
a latent power only drawn forth by the attraction of corresponding
intellectual energies; perfectly natural both in
manner and character, honest, straightforward, sincere, and
true, but with a genuine benevolence which made her sensitively
shrink from the infliction of pain. Delivered altogether
from &lsquo;envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness,&rsquo;
she was ever inclined to extenuate the faults, to pardon the
errors, and to put the best construction on the motives of
others; no mean jealousy ever entered her mind, no repining
at the prosperity, however unmerited, of other people.
She drew pleasure from the purest of all sources, from the
contemplation of the success, the happiness, and the welfare
of her friends and acquaintance. With an exquisite tact,
without the slightest appearance of art, frank without
severity, open without imprudence, always negligent of self
and considerate of others, all her thoughts, impulses, and
actions were regulated by the united influence of the highest
principles, the clearest judgement, and the kindliest feelings.
Thus blessed in her own happy disposition, she was a blessing
to all around her. She was the ornament and delight
of society, the comfort, support, and joy of her own family.
The numerous friends who admired and esteemed her will
sincerely deplore her loss; the world, in which she never
made an enemy, will render its tribute of justice to her
merit in a transient but general expression of regret; but to
the grief of her children, the bitterness of which time alone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
can assuage, time itself can afford but an imperfect consolation,
for so entirely was she associated with the interests,
the habits, and the pursuits of their existence, that every
passing day and hour will bring something to remind them
of the loss they have sustained. But although it has not
been permitted to them to see her days extended to the
ordinary term of human life, and to be engaged in the tender
office of &lsquo;rocking the cradle of her declining age,&rsquo; for herself
it is no unhappy or unenviable lot to have closed a useful,
an honourable, and a prosperous career in the unimpaired
possession of her faculties, without mental disquietude or
bodily pain, and surrounded by all the dearest objects of her
interest and her love.</p>

<h3>June 1st, 1838</h3>

<p>Nothing has happened of any importance
during the last week but the defeat of Government upon the
Slave question (Sir E. Wilmot&rsquo;s motion for immediate emancipation),
on Tuesday last, and this happened by an accident.
Nobody expected an early division, and people were scattered
all over the town. Ben
Stanley<a name="FNA_03_06" id="FNA_03_06"></a><a href="#FN_03_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
was dining at the Hollands&rsquo;.
In the meantime Lord Stanley persuaded Rice that it was
better to have no debate, and that it was neither necessary
nor desirable that they should speak. Rice acquiesced, and
so they went to a division, but unfortunately before a sufficient
number of their people had arrived. It was embarrassing,
but Lord John Russell has taken measures to set the
matter right before the West Indian mail goes out. The Abolitionists,
however, are determined to do as much mischief as
they can, and though they know perfectly well that Government
(and Parliament, for the Tories are in the same intention)
are resolved not to consent to alter the law, and that
the Bill for protecting the apprentices is gone out, they are
resolved to agitate as violently as they can, and, if possible,
to stir up the negroes to insurrection. These men of peace
would prefer a violent commotion in the West Indies,
attended with every sort of mischief to the slaves as well as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD BROUGHAM AND MR. HANDLEY.</span>
to the planters, rather than abandon their own schemes and
notions, in which there is much more of vanity and the love
of meddling than of benevolence and charity. The whole
conduct of Sir Eardley Wilmot, who is only the organ of a
party, proves this; for, though well aware he could take no
advantage of his resolution, and that if nothing was done to
correct the effect of it, a great deal of excitement would be
produced in the colony, he nevertheless tried to shirk the
question when asked by John Russell to say distinctly what
he meant to do, and showed that his only object was to
create a difficulty, whatever might be the consequences, and
to exhibit himself to the country as the successful asserter
of a principle.</p>

<p>On Friday, at Exeter Hall, while engaged in the same
cause, Brougham got a severe rap on the knuckles from Mr.
Handley&mdash;one of those rebuffs to which, with all his talents,
he exposes himself, from his tricks and his violence, and,
above all, his want of truth. Brougham made a speech, in
which he belaboured the Ministry generally, and many of
them by name, with his usual acrimony. Handley, who
had a resolution to move, said he regretted to see the chairman
prostitute the cause for which they were assembled
by making it the vehicle of abuse of the Government, and
thus venting his spite, disappointed ambition, and mortified
vanity; on which Brougham rose in a great rage, and said
he did not know who the gentleman was who, coming at the
eleventh hour, attacked him, who had been a labourer in the
cause for thirty years; to which the other retorted that he
did not know what he meant by his coming at the eleventh
hour, that he had been for many years in Parliament, and
had voted against the grant of twenty millions, and for
immediate emancipation, in opposition to the apprenticeship
system, both of which Brougham had been a party to proposing.</p>

<p>I dined yesterday at Lambeth, at the Archbishop&rsquo;s public
dinner, the handsomest entertainment I ever saw. There
were nearly a hundred people present, all full-dressed or in
uniform. Nothing can be more dignified and splendid than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the whole arrangement, and the dinner was well served and
very good. The Archbishop is a very meek and quiet man,
not dignified, but very civil and attentive. It is excessively
well worth seeing.<a name="FNA_03_07" id="FNA_03_07"></a><a href="#FN_03_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>On Friday night the Bishop of Norwich (Stanley) stood
up and fought the Bishop of Exeter, in the House of Lords,
with great success, upon the Irish education question.</p>

<h3>June 3rd, 1838</h3>

<p>On Tuesday last all was harmony in the
House of Commons. Peel made a speech, in which he announced
his disposition to come to a compromise, and settle
all the Irish questions. Lord John answered in a corresponding
strain of conciliation, and it was generally understood
that everything should be quietly settled, not, however,
to the satisfaction of the Tory tail, much growling being
heard, both in the newspapers and among the low retainers
of the party. (Stanley told somebody, who told me, that he
thought this the best speech he ever heard Peel make.)
But on Friday night this serene sky was overcast with
clouds, and all is thrown into doubt and difficulty again.
They are quarrelling about the qualification, and angry
words were bandied
about.<a name="FNA_03_08" id="FNA_03_08"></a><a href="#FN_03_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
O&rsquo;Connell and Sheil were
abusive, though Peel and Lord John both kept their tempers.
It is supposed that the Tory party have been so urgent, that
Peel is obliged to take up this ground. When they have
gone so far towards a settlement, it is probable that some
mode will be hit upon for arranging the difficulty. The
mob of Tories would be rejoiced to see everything fall to the
ground. &lsquo;Thank God,&rsquo; said one the other night, after the
renewal of hostilities, &lsquo;there is an end of compromise.&rsquo; I
am disposed on the whole (but very imperfectly informed) to
think that John Russell is right and Peel wrong, and that
the former has made all the concessions that ought to be
required of him and that he can afford to make.</p>

(whom I met at
Brooks&rsquo;s), and asked him to tell me candidly who was in the
right about the qualification, John Russell or Peel? He
said, &lsquo;talking openly to you, I don&rsquo;t mind saying both are a
little in the wrong; but the fact is, the other party do not
know what would be the practical effect of the qualification
they require, and when that is made clear to them, in Dublin
particularly&rsquo; (and he mentioned some numbers and details I
don&rsquo;t exactly recollect), &lsquo;I think they will see the necessity of
altering their opinions.&rsquo; He then talked of the political
effect of settling these questions as clearing away the
obstacles which now stand in Peel&rsquo;s way, and said he
thought it would eventually end in some sort of amalgamation
of parties. This I was surprised to hear from him, and
told him that it appeared to me quite impossible. But it is
clear enough that it is the intention of the Government, at
all events, to settle the questions, and if the Opposition will
not give way, they will. They are quite right, for it is a
great thing to get the principle admitted and to have
corporations established; and if upon trial it is found that
there is an undue preponderance cast into either scale, it
will be good ground for proposing an alteration of the law.</p>

<p>At Hillingdon, for Ascot races, from
Tuesday to Friday. A great concourse of people on Thursday;
the Queen tolerably received; some shouting, not a great
deal, and few hats taken off. This mark of respect has quite
gone out of use, and neither her station nor her sex procures
it; we are not the nearer a revolution for this, but it is ugly.
All the world went on to the Royal Stand, and Her Majesty
was very gracious and civil, speaking to everybody.</p>

<h3>June 21st, 1838</h3>

<p>O&rsquo;Connell has declined the Irish Rolls (Mastership
of the Rolls). He says that it has been the object of his
ambition all his life, but that at this moment he cannot
accept it; that the moderate course which the Government
is pursuing (the abandonment of the Appropriation Clauses
&amp;c.) and his support of that course have already given great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
umbrage to the violent party in Ireland, and his acceptance
of office would be considered as the result of a bargain by
which he had bartered the principles he has always maintained
in order to obtain this place; that his influence would
be entirely lost; a ferment produced in Ireland which he
would be unable to suppress, and the Government would
be placed in great difficulty. He therefore thinks himself
bound to refuse the Rolls, and to continue to exert his
influence to keep matters quiet, and enable the Government to
accomplish the settlement of the pending questions, hoping
that at some future time an opportunity may occur of
raising him to the Bench, of which he may be able to avail
himself. Lord Tavistock, who told me this, says no one could
behave better than he has done about it, and he gives him
credit (as the whole party do) for sincerity and purity of
motive. Taking his recent conduct generally in connexion,
with this refusal, I am disposed to believe that his motives
are good, and that he is really desirous of aiding in the
compromise which is about to take place, and promoting the
great work of Irish pacification, not probably without some
personal views and objects; and if the present Government
remains in, his present act of self-denial will be &lsquo;reculer
pour mieux sauter,&rsquo; and find its reward in the Chief Justiceship
whenever Lord Chief Justice Bush retires, of which
there is already a question.</p>

<p>The debate in the House of Lords the night before last,
on Londonderry&rsquo;s Spanish motion, elicited from Lord Minto
a curious fact (that is, the fact was asserted and not denied)
that orders had been sent from hence to our ships of war to
prevent by force any aid being given to Don Carlos by the
ships of other nations, and that a Sardinian frigate had
actually been forcibly prevented. It has made a great
sensation here among the diplomatists.</p>

<p>Another thing much talked of is the speech which Lord
Anglesey made at the Waterloo dinner when he gave the
Duke&rsquo;s health. He said that</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0;">&lsquo;it was superfluous to talk of
his military achievements, but that he must express his
admiration of his conduct in civil matters, especially in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MARSHAL SOULT IN LONDON.</span>
House of Lords during the present session, when he had
shown how superior he was to all party considerations and
purposes, and when he had given his support to a Government
in which it was well known he placed no confidence,
because he thought that the national honour and interest
required that they should be supported.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-indent: 0;">Of course, a speech
reported at second or third hand is not very correctly given,
but this was the gist of it, extremely well done by all
accounts, not perhaps palatable to all who heard him, but
which gave great pleasure to the Duke himself. Anglesey
said that the Duke, when he sat down, squeezed his hand
hard and long, and said to him, &lsquo;I cannot tell you what
pleasure you have given me.&rsquo; The Queen sent the Duke a
gracious message, desiring he would bring the whole of his
party to her ball, which gratified him very much, and he
wrote a very grateful and respectful answer. The French
were exceedingly annoyed at the ball being given on that
particular night (the 18th), and begged to be excused from
attending, not angrily however. It was unfortunate that
this day was chosen for the ball, but it was accidental, and
not intended as a celebration.</p>

Croker meets him with an
offensive article in the &lsquo;Quarterly,&rsquo; brought out on purpose,
and emanating from his spiteful and malignant temper,
just the reverse of the Duke, who has made Gurwood keep
back the eleventh volume of the Despatches, in which the
battle of Toulouse appears, because some of the details are
calculated to be annoying to Soult&mdash;a piece of delicacy
which is very becoming. It is a sad thing to see how the
Duke is altered in appearance, and what a stride old age has
made upon him. He is much deafer than he was, he is
whiter, his head is bent, his shoulders are raised, and there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
are muscular twitches in his face, not altogether new, but of
a more marked character.</p>

[The preparations for the Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Victoria,
were now actively going on. Marshal Soult arrived in London as the
Ambassador Extraordinary of the King of the French, and was received with
the highest distinction and respect, to which Mr. Croker&rsquo;s article in the
&lsquo;Quarterly Review&rsquo; on the battle of Toulouse was the solitary and disgraceful
exception.]</p></div>

<h3>June 24th, 1838</h3>

<p>Lord Anglesey gave me his speech at the
Waterloo dinner to read, and very good it
is.<a name="FNA_03_11" id="FNA_03_11"></a><a href="#FN_03_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
I wanted him to let me send it to the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; and he told me I might do
as I liked. I resolved to consult Tavistock, who was (on the
whole) against publishing, for fear it should be displeasing
to the Duke, so I give up the idea. What he said about the
Duke was this, after alluding to his military glory &amp;c.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0;">
&lsquo;But there is a subject on which I wish to say a word, and
it shall be only a word. I allude to the noble, the generous,
the disinterested, the truly patriotic conduct of the noble
Duke in his Parliamentary course. At the opening of the
session the country was involved in difficulty, and under
very considerable embarrassment; the spirit of faction had
crossed the Atlantic; the demon of discord was abroad; one
of the most favoured and interesting of our colonies was in
revolt. The noble Duke saw this, and seemed at once to
decide that it would require all the energies of the mother
country to crush the Hydra at its birth. Accordingly, when
any measure was brought forward tending to support the
dignity, to uphold the honour, and to secure the integrity of
the empire, the noble Duke invariably came forward and
nobly supported those measures. But the noble Duke did
not stop there: spurning the miserable practices of party
spirit, he upon many occasions offered his sage and solid
counsel to a Government which he had not been in the habit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PREPARATIONS FOR THE CORONATION.</span>
of supporting. Gentlemen, I declare to you that this
conduct has made a deep impression on me. It appears to me
that this is the true character and conduct of a real patriot;
such conduct is, in my estimation, beyond all praise.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_03_11" id="FN_03_11"></a><a href="#FNA_03_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>
The impression which Lord Anglesey&rsquo;s speech made was not such as
his own report of it was calculated to make. A word makes a difference,
and he was supposed to have said that the Duke had &lsquo;separated&rsquo; himself
from faction, which implied censure on others and made it a <i>political speech</i>,
and though Anglesey says the Duke was so pleased, Gurwood told me that
in reply he merely said &lsquo;He believed every man present would have done,
in his place, what he had done,&rsquo; and he afterwards asked Gurwood if he had
said anything in his reply that could <i>annoy</i> Lord Anglesey, which looks as
if he was not so highly pleased as the former supposed him to be. Gurwood
said, &lsquo;We were all on thorns when he talked of faction, and the Duke replied,
&ldquo;Poor man, he was suffering very much, and he is not used to public
speaking, so that he did not know what he was saying.&rdquo;&rsquo; If Anglesey
could hear this!</p></div>

<h3>June 27th, 1838</h3>

<p>There never was anything seen like the
state of this town; it is as if the population had been on a
sudden quintupled; the uproar, the confusion, the crowd,
the noise, are indescribable. Horsemen, footmen, carriages
squeezed, jammed, intermingled, the pavement blocked up
with timbers, hammering and knocking, and falling fragments
stunning the ears and threatening the head; not a
mob here and there, but the town all mob, thronging,
bustling, gaping, and gazing at everything, at anything, or
at nothing; the park one vast encampment, with banners
floating on the tops of the tents, and still the roads are
covered, the railroads loaded with arriving multitudes. From
one end of the route of the Royal procession to the other,
from the top of Piccadilly to Westminster Abbey, there is a
vast line of scaffolding; the noise, the movement, the
restlessness are incessant and universal; in short, it is very
curious, but uncommonly tiresome, and the sooner it is over
the better. There has been a grand bother about the Ambassadors
forming part of the Royal Procession. They all detest
it, think they ought not to have been called upon to assist,
and the poor representatives of the smaller Courts do not at
all fancy the expense of fine equipages, or the mortification
of exhibiting mean ones. This arrangement was matter of
negotiation for several days, and (the Lord knows why) the
Government pertinaciously insisted on it. Public opinion
has declared against it, and now they begin to see that
they have done a very foolish thing, odious to the Corps
Diplomatique and unpleasing to the people.</p>

<p>The Duke and Soult have met here with great mutual
civilities, and it is very generally known that the former did
everything he could to stop the appearance of Croker&rsquo;s
article. Gurwood told me that he begged the Duke to write
to Croker and request he would keep it back. The Duke
said, &lsquo;I will write because you wish it, but I tell you that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
he won&rsquo;t do it. When a man&rsquo;s vanity or his interest is
concerned he minds nobody, and <i>he</i> thinks himself a cleverer
fellow than anybody.&rsquo; The Duke knew his man, for he
flatly refused, and intimated that though the Duke might be
a better judge of military matters, he (Croker) was the best
of literary.</p>

<p>A great squabble is going on about the Wellington
memorial,<a name="FNA_03_12" id="FNA_03_12"></a><a href="#FN_03_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
in which I have so far been concerned that
Lord Tavistock got me to write the requisition to the Duke
of Rutland to call another meeting of the committee, to
reconsider the question of the selection of the artist. It is
a gross job of Sir Frederic Trench&rsquo;s, and has been so from
the beginning, the Duke being a mere cat&rsquo;s-paw of that impudent
Irish pretender. The Duke of Wellington himself
thinks it a great job, and would be very glad to see it
defeated; but he said that &lsquo;his lips were sealed, he could
take no part, the Duke of Rutland had been so personally
kind to him, but that it was the damnedest job from the
beginning.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_03_12" id="FN_03_12"></a><a href="#FNA_03_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a>
[This refers to the subscription for a memorial to the Duke of
Wellington, which led eventually to the strange erection of the equestrian
statue of the Duke, placed <i>upon</i> the arch at the top of Constitution Hill and
in front of Apsley House. Sir Frederic Trench took an active part in the
promotion of the affair, in the selection of Wyatt for the artist, and finally
in the placing of the statue, which appeared to most people who knew all
the facts at the time, to be a scandalous job and an enormous absurdity. In
the year 1883 the arch was moved from its former position and the statue
taken down, to be transported to the camp at Aldershot and erected there.]</p></div>

<h3>June 29th, 1838</h3>

<p>The Coronation (which, thank God, is over)
went off very well. The day was fine, without heat or rain&mdash;the
innumerable multitude which thronged the streets
orderly and satisfied. The appearance of the Abbey was
beautiful, particularly the benches of the Peeresses, who
were blazing with diamonds. The entry of Soult was
striking. He was saluted with a murmur of curiosity and
applause as he passed through the nave, and nearly the same,
as he advanced along the choir. His appearance is that of
a veteran warrior, and he walked alone, with his numerous
suite following at a respectful distance, preceded by heralds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE CORONATION.</span>
and ushers, who received him with marked attention, more
certainly than any of the other Ambassadors. The Queen
looked very diminutive, and the effect of the procession itself
was spoilt by being too crowded; there was not interval
enough between the Queen and the Lords and others going
before her. The Bishop of London (Blomfield) preached a
very good sermon. The different actors in the ceremonial
were very imperfect in their parts, and had neglected to
rehearse them. Lord John Thynne, who officiated for the
Dean of Westminster, told me that nobody knew what was
to be done except the Archbishop and himself (who had
rehearsed), Lord Willoughby (who is experienced in these
matters), and the Duke of Wellington, and consequently
there was a continual difficulty and embarrassment, and the
Queen never knew what she was to do next. They made
her leave her chair and enter into St. Edward&rsquo;s Chapel
before the prayers were concluded, much to the discomfiture
of the Archbishop. She said to John Thynne, &lsquo;Pray tell
me what I am to do, for they don&rsquo;t know;&rsquo; and at the end,
when the orb was put into her hand, she said to him, &lsquo;What
am I to do with it?&rsquo; &lsquo;Your Majesty is to carry it, if you
please, in your hand.&rsquo; &lsquo;Am I?&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;it is very heavy.&rsquo;
The ruby ring was made for her little finger instead of the
fourth, on which the rubric prescribes that it should be put.
When the Archbishop was to put it on, she extended the
former, but he said it must be on the latter. She said it
was too small, and she could not get it on. He said it
was right to put it there, and, as he insisted, she yielded,
but had first to take off her other rings, and then this was
forced on, but it hurt her very much, and as soon as the
ceremony was over she was obliged to bathe her finger in
iced water in order to get it off. The noise and confusion
were very great when the medals were thrown about by
Lord Surrey, everybody scrambling with all their might and
main to get them, and none more vigorously than the Maids
of Honour. There was a great demonstration of applause
when the Duke of Wellington did homage. Lord Rolle, who
is between eighty and ninety, fell down as he was getting up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the steps of the throne. Her first impulse was to rise, and
when afterwards he came again to do homage she said, &lsquo;May
I not get up and meet him?&rsquo; and then rose from the throne
and advanced down one or two of the steps to prevent his
coming up, an act of graciousness and kindness which made a great
sensation.<a name="FNA_03_13" id="FNA_03_13"></a><a href="#FN_03_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
It is, in fact, the remarkable union of <i>naïveté</i>,
kindness, nature, good nature, with propriety and dignity,
which makes her so admirable and so endearing to those
about her, as she certainly is. I have been repeatedly told
that they are all warmly attached to her, but that all feel
the impossibility of for a moment losing sight of the respect
which they owe her. She never ceases to be a Queen, but
is always the most charming, cheerful, obliging, unaffected
Queen in the world. The procession was very handsome,
and the Extraordinary Ambassadors produced some gorgeous
equipages. This sort of procession is incomparably better
than the old ceremonial which so much fuss was made
about, for the banquet would only have benefited the privileged
few and the rich, and for one person who would have
witnessed the procession on the platform five hundred enjoyed
a sight of this. In fact, the thing best worth seeing
was the town itself, and the countless multitudes through
which the procession passed. The Chancellor of the Exchequer
told me that he had been informed 200,000&#8467;. had
been paid for seats alone, and the number of people who
have flocked into London has been estimated at five hundred
thousand. It is said that a million have had a sight of the
show in one way or another. These numbers are possibly
exaggerated, but they really were prodigious. From Buckingham
Palace to Westminster Abbey, by the way they took,
which must be two or three miles in length, there was a
dense mass of people; the seats and benches were all full,
every window was occupied, the roofs of the houses were
covered with spectators, for the most part well dressed, and,
from the great space through which they were distributed,
there was no extraordinary pressure, and consequently no
room for violence or ill-humour. In the evening I met
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">COLERIDGE AND JOHN STERLING.</span>
Prince Esterhazy, and asked him what the foreigners said.
He replied that they admired it all very much: &lsquo;Strogonoff
and the others don&rsquo;t like you, but they feel it, and it makes
a great impression on them; in fact, nothing can be seen
like it in any other country.&rsquo; I went into the park, where
the fair was going on; a vast multitude, but all of the lower
orders; not very amusing. The great merit of this Coronation
is, that so much has been done for the people: to
amuse and interest <i>them</i> seems to have been the principal
object.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0;">My own thoughts about myself. Mr. Sterling, whom I met

&lsquo;Times&rsquo;<a name="FNA_03_14" id="FNA_03_14"></a><a href="#FN_03_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>),
said that Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats were
all greater poets than Dryden, that they had all finer
imaginations. He compared &lsquo;The Vision of Kubla Khan&rsquo;
to &lsquo;Lycidas&rsquo; for harmony of versification!!</p>

[This was Mr. John Sterling, whose life has been written by Thomas
Carlyle, and again by Julius Hare, though it was a short and uneventful
one. Few men left a deeper mark upon his own contemporaries, not less by
the grace and purity of his character than by the vigour of his intellect.
It is hard to think that of so bright a promise of life and thought so little
remains after him. Sterling was sometimes paradoxical, and he worshipped
Coleridge, which may account for the incident related in the text.]</p></div>

<p>A great exposure of Durham in the House
of Lords on Monday
night,<a name="FNA_03_15" id="FNA_03_15"></a><a href="#FN_03_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Brougham chuckling over it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
yesterday morning. The impression left by Melbourne&rsquo;s
speech was, that Durham had actually assured him he had
no intention of appointing Turton, and it was either so, or
Melbourne had desired him not to do so, and he went off
without sending any answer. The former discussion about
Turton took place while Durham was at Portsmouth. Everything
blows over, so probably this will, but it is calculated
to produce a very bad effect both here and in Canada, and to
deprive Durham of all the weight which would attach to
him from the notion of his being trusted and trustworthy;
besides, the bitter mortification to his pride (by receiving
this rap on the knuckles at the outset of his career) will
sour his temper and impair his judgement. Brougham says
that if he finds his difficulties great and his position
disagreeable, he will avail himself of Melbourne&rsquo;s speech and
resign. It is universally thought that he must send Turton
home whatever he may do himself.</p>

[Lord Durham took with him to Canada, on his staff, besides Mr. Charles
Buller (an unexceptionable appointment), Mr. Turton, of the Calcutta Bar,
and Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield, gentlemen against whose private
character much had been not unjustly said. Some of these appointments
were strongly objected to in Parliament.]</p></div>

<h3>July 8th, 1838</h3>

<p>Lord Duncannon told me yesterday that
Melbourne went to Lord Durham when he heard he was going
to take out Turton, and told him that the odium of such an
appointment would be so great that it was impossible he
could consent to it, and it must not take place. Durham
sulked over it for two days, but finally acquiesced, and
engaged that Turton should only go out as his private
friend. Duncannon added that Durham was much mistaken
if he thought Melbourne would endure this disobedience
and breach of engagement. Durham had made his entry
into Quebec on a white long-tailed charger, in a full general&rsquo;s
uniform, surrounded by his staff, and the first thing he did
was to appoint Sir John Doratt (his doctor, whom he had got
knighted before he went) Inspector-General of Hospitals,
superseding all the people there.</p>

<h3>July 14th, 1838</h3>

<p>At Newmarket all this past week. Nothing
of consequence occurred here except the debate in the House
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE NAVAL INSTRUCTIONS.</span>
of Lords upon Brougham&rsquo;s motion for the production of
naval instructions about Sardinian ships, which was only
lost by the numbers being equal. The Duke of Wellington,
according to his custom, refused to be factious, and when
Melbourne said that it would be highly inconvenient to produce
any instructions, he declared against the motion and
left the House. Brougham was furious, and many of the
high Tories greatly provoked. Brougham said, &lsquo;Westminster
Abbey is yawning for him.&rsquo; Ellenborough, Mansfield,
and Harewood stayed and voted, Aberdeen went away.
After all their fury, however, the Tories are beginning (as I
was told last night) to come to their senses. The Duke was
quite in the right; there is no doubt that some very unwise
and improper instructions have issued from the Admiralty,
and their purport has got abroad by the indiscretion of
somebody, but we only know, or rather suspect from public
rumour, that such is the case; they have never been acted
upon if they do exist; no overt act has been done, and the
production of this document might be attended with very
seriously inconvenient consequences. Brougham cares for
nothing but the pleasure of worrying and embarrassing the
Ministers, whom he detests with an intense hatred; and the
Tories, who are bitter and spiteful, and hate them merely as
Ministers and as occupants of the places they covet, and not
as men, are provoked to death at being baulked in the occasion
that seemed to present itself of putting them into a
difficulty. The Duke, whose thoughts are steadily directed
to the public good, and to that alone, will lend himself to no
such vexatious purposes; he looks at the position of the
Government in relation with foreign powers, and deals with
it as a national and not as a party question. It is in this
spirit that he constantly and inflexibly acts, though not
failing to give Ministers a pretty sharp lecture every now
and then. His forbearance has annoyed his own supporters
to such a degree that they keep up a continual under-growl,
and are always lamenting the decay of his faculties, and if
they dared and knew how, they would gladly substitute
some other leader for him. The &lsquo;ardor prava jubentium&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
has, however, no effect whatever on him: it neither ruffles
his serenity nor shakes his purpose. The Whigs laud him
to the skies, which provokes the Tories all the more, nor
does their praise spring in all probability from a purer or
more unselfish source than the complaints of their adversaries,
for they are more rejoiced at finding so often this
plank of safety than struck with admiration at his magnanimity.
Wise, moderate, and impartial men of all parties
view the Duke&rsquo;s conduct in its true light, and render him
that justice the full measure of which it is reserved for
history and posterity to pay. No greater contrast can be
displayed than between the minds of the Duke of Wellington
and Brougham. It is a curious and an interesting study to
examine and compare their powers, faculties, attainments,
the moral and intellectual constitutions of the men, their
respective careers, their results, and the judgement of the
world upon them.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I met
Macaulay,<a name="FNA_03_16" id="FNA_03_16"></a><a href="#FN_03_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
and walked with him for some time. He talked of the necessity of a coalition
between the Parliamentary leaders, which might be effected,
provided they would lay aside personal feelings and jealousies;
that Lyndhurst might be the greatest obstacle; he thought
a strong Government ought to be formed, one that should not
live as this does from hand to mouth, and by no means but
by a coalition could this be effected. The Radicals, he said,
were clearly extinct, being reduced, as far as he could learn,
&lsquo;to Grote and his wife;&rsquo; that he had not been prepared for
the tranquillity and contentment that he found on his return
to England; that he was as great a Radical as anybody,
that is, that if ever the voice of the nation should be as
clearly and universally pronounced for reform of the House
of Lords, or any other great change, as it had been for the
Reform Bill, he should be for it too, but that now he did not
think it worth while to give such projects a thought, and it
no more occurred to him to entertain them in this country
than it would to advocate the establishment of a representative

<span class="pagehead">THE RECEPTION OF MARSHAL SOULT.</span>
government in Turkey, or a monarchy and hereditary
peerage in America. I told him that I did not see how a
coalition was feasible, or how conflicting pretensions could
be adjusted. He said it seemed to be a matter of course that
Peel must lead the House of Commons. I said that the
other alternative the Government had was to get rid of some
of its lumber, and take in him, Morpeth, and Sir George
Grey, and so present a more respectable front&mdash;to which he
said nothing.</p>

in June 1838.]</p></div>

<p>It is really curious to see the manner in which Soult has
been received here, not only with every sort of attention and
respect by persons in the most respectable ranks in life,
members of all the great trading and commercial bodies, but
with enthusiasm by the common people; they flock about
him, cheer him vociferously, and at the review in the park
he was obliged to abandon both his hands to be shaken by
those around him. The old soldier is touched to the quick
at this generous reception, and has given utterance to his
gratitude and his sensibility on several occasions in very apt
terms. It is creditable to John Bull, but I am at a loss
to understand why he is so desperately fond of Soult; but
Johnny is a gentleman who generally does things in excess,
and seldom anything by halves. In the present instance it
is a very good thing, and must be taken as a national
compliment and as evidence of national goodwill towards
France, which cannot fail to make a corresponding impression
in that country. But the French will not meet us
cordially and frankly and with an equally amicable spirit;
they are not such good fellows as the English; they have
more vanity and jealousy, and are not so hearty; still it will
not be without effect.</p>

<h3>July 18th, 1838</h3>

<p>The Duke of Sussex has quarrelled with the
Government on account of their refusal to apply to Parliament
for an increased allowance, and his partisans are very
angry with Melbourne, and talk of withdrawing their support.
The Duke began by requesting Melbourne to bring the
matter before the Cabinet, which he did, and the result was
that they informed his Royal Highness it could not be done.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
He was very angry, and the rest of the Royal family (glad to
make bad blood between him and the Whigs) fomented his
discontent. The Duke of Cambridge went to Melbourne and
begged that he might not stand in the way of his brother&rsquo;s
wishes, from its being supposed that if they were complied
with, his own claims could likewise be urged. The Duke,
finding he could do nothing with the Government, determined
to do what he could for himself, and began to canvass
and exert all the influence he possessed among Members of
Parliament, and (as he thought) with such success, that he
counted upon 250 votes in his favour. He then employed
Mr. Gillon to move the matter in the House of Commons,
having previously conveyed to Melbourne his intention to do
what he could for himself, but not making any communication
to Lord John Russell, and directing his confidants to conceal
from him what it was intended to do. Accordingly John
Russell paid very little attention to the motion of Mr. Gillon,
which he saw entered on the Order Book, and when it came
on, he opposed it. Peel pronounced a very warm eulogium
upon John Russell&rsquo;s conduct, and the motion was rejected
by ninety to forty, the Duke&rsquo;s anticipated supporters having
dwindled away to that paltry number. Bitter was his mortification
and violent his resentment at this result. He wrote an
angry letter to John Russell, to which John sent a temperate
and respectful reply, but his Royal Highness has since informed
Melbourne that he shall withdraw his support from
the Government, and the Duke of Cleveland has likewise
given notice that the conduct of Government to the Duke
&lsquo;makes the whole difference&rsquo; in his disposition to support
them. The Duke&rsquo;s friends generally have expressed so much
dissatisfaction, that it is matter of considerable embarrassment
and annoyance to the Government, and if this was to
be carried to the length of opposition, or even neutrality, it
might be productive of serious consequences, weak as they
are. But as this session is about to close, means will probably
be found of pacifying them before the opening of the
next. Much of the mischief has arisen from the want of
communication and understanding between the parties. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CLAIM OF THE DUKE OF SUSSEX.</span>
seems strange that Lord John Russell should have been
ignorant of the Duke&rsquo;s intentions when Melbourne had been
apprised of them, and the latter ought to have imparted to
the former all he had learnt with regard to them. Lord
John Russell says that they seldom communicate except with
regard to matters which come before the Cabinet, and that
if he had learnt that Lord Radnor or any other peer was
going to make some such motion in the House of Lords, he
should not have thought of speaking to Melbourne about it,
each managing his matters in his own way in the House to
which he belongs. But though he makes this excuse for
Melbourne, it was great <i>laches</i> in the latter, after what had
passed, not to tell Lord John what was in preparation, when
some communication with the Duke&rsquo;s friends might have
prevented the discussion. On the other hand, it was very
bad policy in the Duke not to be more open with the leader
of the House of Commons and to attempt to carry his object
by force. But he had buoyed himself up with the notion
that his popularity was so great that there would be a
Parliamentary demonstration in his favour sufficient to compel
the Ministers to yield, and he now sees how much he
overrated it, and miscalculated the support he fancied he
had secured. What he complains of with the greatest bitterness
is the conduct of Lord Howick in having asked Mr.
Hawes to oppose this grant: &lsquo;that the son of the man whose
administration I made only a few years ago should have
canvassed others to oppose me is the deepest wound that
ever was inflicted on me.&rsquo; He fancies (it seems) that <i>he
made</i> Lord Grey&rsquo;s administration!</p>

<p>The Duke has some sort of claim, under all the circumstances.
When King William came to the throne, he told
him he was anxious to do what he could for him, and would
therefore give him the best thing at his disposal, the Rangership
of Windsor Park, 4,000&#8467;. a year; but immediately after
came Lord Grey&rsquo;s economical reforms, which swept this
away. The King then gave him Bushey; but it was found
necessary to settle a jointure house on the Queen Dowager
and Bushey was taken from him for this purpose. At last
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
they gave him the Rangership of Hyde Park, and he had
actually drawn for the first quarter&rsquo;s salary, when the salary
was done away with, so that he has been three times disappointed,
and he really is over head and ears in debt. It
is now more difficult than ever to do anything for him,
because all parties are committed, and there is a vote of the
House of Commons recorded against the grant. In his
dudgeon, he talks of withdrawing from politics, and of
selling by public auction all his personal property, library
included.</p>

<p>I went the other night (Friday) to

opera at Braham&rsquo;s theatre. A vast deal of fine company, and
prodigious applause; tolerable music, moderately sung, but
a favourable audience. When it was over they insisted upon
his appearing, and, after some delay, he thrust his head out
from an obscure pit-box in which he had been sitting and
bowed and smiled; but this was not enough, and they would
have him on the stage; so a great clapping and shouting
went on, among the most vociferous being the Duke of Wellington,
who enjoyed the fun like a boy, laughing and beckoning
to Burghersh, and bawling &lsquo;Maestro! Maestro!&rsquo; till at
last, vanquished by the enthusiasm of the audience and the
encouragement of his friends, he appeared at a corner of the
stage; then came a shower of bouquets, which were picked
up by Mrs. Bishop and the other women and presented to
him, and so ended the triumphant night.</p>

<h3>July 24th, 1838</h3>

<p>High Church has been recently reading lectures
to Her Majesty the Queen in the shape of two sermons
preached at the Chapel Royal by Mr. Perceval and
Mr. Hook.<a name="FNA_03_18" id="FNA_03_18"></a><a href="#FN_03_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
The Bishop of London was cognizant of Mr. Perceval&rsquo;s intention,
and he preached himself for several Sundays, probably
for the purpose of keeping him out of the pulpit; but,
the Bishop having had a fall from his horse and broken his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MR. HOOK&rsquo;S SERMON.</span>
collar-bone, Mr. Perceval found his opportunity. The Bishop,
however, previously warned the Queen that she must expect
a very <i>strong</i> sermon, which naturally excited her curiosity,
and when she heard it it did not appear to her so strong as she
had expected. The Bishop&rsquo;s advice or his own reflexion may
have induced Mr. Perceval to soften it. He made an attack
upon Peel (that is, upon somebody whom they concluded to
be Peel), reproaching him with sacrificing his conscience to
political objects in consenting to Catholic emancipation, not
<i>totidem verbis</i>, but in words to this effect. Hook&rsquo;s sermon
appears to have been the stronger of the two. He told the
Queen that the Church would endure let what would happen
to the throne. On her return to Buckingham House, Normanby,
who had been at the chapel, said to her, &lsquo;Did not
your Majesty find it very hot?&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;Yes, and the
sermon was very hot too.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>July 28th, 1838</h3>

<p>The letters between Lord Palmerston and
Mr. Urquhart which appeared two days ago in the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo;
have made a very great sensation, and thrown the friends of
the former into great alarm. Urquhart&rsquo;s letter is so enormously
long, so overlaid with matter, and so stuffed with
acrimonious abuse, that it is difficult to seize the points of
it; but that to which general attention is directed is the positive
assertion of Lord Palmerston that he had nothing to do
with the &lsquo;Portfolio,&rsquo; and the announcement of Urquhart that
in consequence of such denegation he will demonstrate that
Palmerston had everything to do with it. He is said to
make exceedingly light of it, and asserts that he can clear
himself of all the imputations Mr. Urquhart seeks to cast
upon him. He has, however, committed a great blunder in
entering into a paper war at all. In his letter he correctly
lays down the principle of the irresponsibility and omnipotence
of a Secretary of State in relation to his agents, and
there he ought to have stopped, and, acting on that principle,
have declined any controversy; but he entered into it,
and descended from his pedestal; and, though his letter is
clever and well written, there are some very weak points in
it, and some things which incline one to doubt his veracity.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Who, for example, can believe that when
Strangways<a name="FNA_03_19" id="FNA_03_19"></a><a href="#FN_03_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
gave him a letter from Urquhart containing (as he informed him)
a statement of his conduct, which conduct he thought so
reprehensible that he had desired Strangways to admonish
and caution him, he should have put this letter in his pocket,
and not even have broken the seal till a long time after?
The Government people are evidently in great consternation,
and it is very remarkable that not a line of contradiction has
appeared in any of Palmerston&rsquo;s papers. No less than three
men (Labouchere, Morpeth, and Le Marchant) spoke to me
about it yesterday, full of doubt and anxiety, and very
curious to know &lsquo;what people said.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_03_19" id="FN_03_19"></a><a href="#FNA_03_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a>
[The Hon. William Strangways, afterwards Earl of Ilchester, was at
this time Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Mr. Strangways
was an old and intimate friend of Prince Adam Czartoryski, by whom the
papers were brought to England which afterwards appeared in the
&lsquo;Portfolio,&rsquo; and it was through this Polish connexion that Mr. Urquhart
was introduced to the notice of the Under-Secretary. Lord Palmerston
was at that time (about 1834) strongly anti-Russian, and was perfectly
cognizant of several undertakings which originated with Prince Adam
Czartoryski, and his more energetic nephew, Count Ladislas Zamoyski, who
had very much the ear of the English Government at that time. These
undertakings were the publication of the &lsquo;Portfolio,&rsquo; Mr. George Bell&rsquo;s
expedition to the coast of Circassia in the &lsquo;Vixen,&rsquo; which was seized there,
and the attempt to establish a Consulate in the then Free-Town of Cracow.
But after having encouraged and promoted these objects for some time in
conjunction with Mr. Strangways, Lord Palmerston suddenly became
violently opposed to them, and disclaimed all knowledge of those whom he
had employed. See <i>infra</i>, January 30th, 1839.]</p></div>

<p>Le Marchant told me that Palmerston was a strange
mixture of caution and imprudence; that as long as he did
not commit himself <i>on paper</i> he thought himself safe; that
he would see any newspaper editor who called on him, and
often communicate to such persons matters of great delicacy;
yet, at the very time he would do this, he demurred to a
request that was made to him to communicate freely with
him (Le Marchant) and Drummond, who were managing the
press on the part of Government; and this reserve was
exercised towards him when he was Brougham&rsquo;s private
secretary, cognisant of all that Brougham knew (which, of
course, was everything), and frequently employed to communicate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MR. URQUHART AND LORD PALMERSTON.</span>
verbally between the Chancellor and his colleagues
on the most confidential matters.</p>

<p>The history of Urquhart is this: William IV. was nearly
mad upon the subject of Russia, and Sir Herbert
Taylor<a name="FNA_03_20" id="FNA_03_20"></a><a href="#FN_03_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
either partook of his opinions or ministered to his prejudices.
Urquhart, who had been in the East, published a violent
anti-Russian pamphlet, which made some noise and which
recommended him to the notice of Taylor, and through him
to that of the King. His Majesty took up Urquhart, and
recommended him to Palmerston. Palmerston was not
sorry to have an opportunity of gratifying the King, with
whom the Ministers were never on cordial terms, and probably
he was not <i>then</i> disinclined to act (as far as he dared)
upon Urquhart&rsquo;s views. Accordingly he appointed him&mdash;a
very extraordinary appointment it was thought at the time&mdash;Secretary
of Embassy at Constantinople. There can be no
doubt that Urquhart considered himself appointed to that
station on account of the opinions he professed, and for the
express purpose of giving them effect. He was very likely
told so by the King, and left to infer as much by Palmerston.
The letter of Strangways, which has appeared in the course
of the correspondence, shows that the communications from
the Foreign Office were in this spirit. At the same time
Palmerston took care not to commit himself in writing.
When the death of the King was approaching, Palmerston
foresaw that he would have to change his tone with regard
to Eastern politics, and consequently that it would be convenient
to throw over Urquhart, which he proceeded to do.
This man, first his tool and then his victim, turned out to
be bold, unprincipled, and clever, and finding his prospects
ruined and his reputation damaged, he turned fiercely upon
him whom he considered as his persecutor and betrayer. It
is fortunate for Palmerston that the matter has broken out
at the end of the Session when people are all on the wing
and there is not time to sift anything to the bottom, but still
the charges are so grave, and they involve such serious consequences
and considerations, that it is absolutely necessary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the truth should be manifested one way or
another.<a name="FNA_03_21" id="FNA_03_21"></a><a href="#FN_03_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
The Foreign Ministers all believe that Palmerston is guilty.
Dedel told me last night that Pozzo had said to him, &lsquo;Quant
à moi, je ne dirai pas un mot; mais si tout cela est vrai, il faut
aller aux galères pour trouver un pareil forfait.&rsquo; Graham said
to me that he was sincerely sorry for it, inasmuch as he had
personally a regard for Palmerston; that no man was ever a
better, more honourable, or kinder colleague, more anxious
to smooth differences and adjust disputes; that <i>he</i> could not
attack him in the House of Commons, neither would Stanley;
that Peel, who hated him, would not dislike doing so, but
that he was too cautious to trust implicitly to Urquhart&rsquo;s
assertions, and to commit himself by acting on them; that
there was nobody else capable of dealing with the subject well, and that
Canning<a name="FNA_03_22" id="FNA_03_22"></a><a href="#FN_03_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
ought not, for the same reasons (only
much stronger in his case) that restrained himself and
Stanley.</p>

was said about it in the newspapers, Urquhart&rsquo;s revelations never appeared,
the public forgot it, and the whole affair died a natural death.&mdash;January 6th,

<p>The bishops were at loggerheads in the House of Lords
the other night on the Ecclesiastical Discipline Bill. Exeter
(Phillpotts), in a most venomous speech, attacked the Archbishop,
whose mildness was stimulated into an angry reply;
but Exeter gained his point, for both Brougham and the
Duke were for postponing the Bill. Phillpotts would have
made a great bishop in the days of Bonner and Gardiner, or
he would have been a Becket, or, still better, a Pope either
in the palmy days of papal power or during the important
period of reaction which succeeded the Reformation. He
seems cast in the mould of a Sixtus.</p>

&lsquo;The sixth volume appears to me among the most extraordinary
of human productions, ancient or modern. It is not
the mere power of sagacity, vigilance, acute and comprehensive
reasoning, or, in short, the intellectual perfection
of the book, various and wonderful as it is, which affects my
mind most deeply: it is the love of justice, the love of truth,
the love of humanity, the love of country, the fine temper,
the tolerance of error, the mildness of reproof, the <i>superb
morality</i> of the great and masculine spirit displayed throughout
it, which it is impossible for an honest man to observe
without affection and admiration.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<h3>August 8th, 1838</h3>

<p>James Stephen yesterday was talking to me
about Macaulay. He came to him soon after his return from
India, and told him that when there he used to get up at five
every morning (as everybody else did), and till nine or ten he
read Greek and Latin, and went through the whole range of
classical literature of every sort and kind; that one day in
the Government library he had met with the works of Chrysostom,
fourteen Greek folios, and that he had taken home
first one volume and then another, till he had read the whole
through, that is, he had not read every word, because he had
found that it contained a great deal of stuff not worth reading,
but he had carefully looked at every page, and had
actually read the greater part. His object now is to devote
himself to literature, and his present project, to write a
History of England for the last 150 years, in which Stephen
says he would give scope to his fine imagination in the
delineation of character, and bring his vast stores of knowledge
to the composition of the narrative, and would, without
doubt, produce a work of astonishing power and interest.
Macaulay says if he had the power of recalling everything he
has ever written and published and of destroying it all, he
would do so, for he thinks that his time has been thrown
away upon <i>opuscula</i> unworthy of his talents. This is, however,
a very preposterous squeamishness and piece of pride
or humility, whichever it may be called, for no man need be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
ashamed of producing anything perfect in its kind, however
the kind may not be the highest, and his reviews are perfect
in their way. I asked Stephen by what mental process
Macaulay had contrived to accumulate such boundless stores
of information, and how it was all so sorted and arranged in
his head that it was always producible at will. He said that
he had first of all the power of abstraction, of giving his
undivided attention to the book and the subject on which he
was occupied; then, as other men read by syllables or by
words, he had the faculty, acquired by use, of reading by
whole sentences, of swallowing, as it were, whole paragraphs
at once, and thus he infinitely abbreviated the mere mechanical
part of study; that as an educated man would read
any number of pages much more quickly than an uneducated
man, so much more quickly would Macaulay read than any
ordinary man. Therefore it is first and foremost the power of
abstraction, that faculty of attention and of rendering up his
mind to the matter before him, which makes all his reading
profitable, and leaves nothing to be wasted and frittered
away. Then the acquired habit of devouring at a glance a
vast surface of print, so that, like the dragon of Wantley, to
whom</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Houses and churches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were like geese and turkeys,</span>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0;">he can discuss a Greek folio while an ordinary man is
dawdling or boggling over a pamphlet or a newspaper.</p>

<p>Nature has certainly cast the mind of Macaulay in a
different mould from that of common men. There is no
more comparison between his brain and such a one as mine
than between a hurdy-gurdy in the street and the great
organ at Haarlem; but it is probably not true that <i>nature</i>
has made all the difference or the greatest part of it. If the
hurdy-gurdy was kept in constant tune and the great instrument
was never played upon, and its barrels and tubes
allowed to grow rusty, the former would at length discourse
the more eloquent music of the two. No care or cultivation
indeed could have made me what Macaulay is, but if he had
wasted his time and frittered away his intellects as I have

done mine, he would only have been an ordinary man; while
if I had been carefully trained and subjected to moral
discipline, I might have acted a creditable and useful part.</p>

<p>Lord Durham<a name="FNA_03_24" id="FNA_03_24"></a><a href="#FN_03_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
has got into a fine scrape
with his Ordinance, which is clearly illegal. Brougham
brought it forward on Tuesday night in an exulting speech,
or rather in many exulting speeches, one of which contained
some eloquent passages. He was transported with joy at
having, as he said, &lsquo;got them at last.&rsquo; The Duke supported
Brougham, but with more temper and dignity; the Ministers
made but a poor defence, if defence it could be called. Durham&rsquo;s
appointments cancelled and his proclamations declared
illegal will neither sweeten his temper nor exalt his character
in Canada.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_03_24" id="FN_03_24"></a><a href="#FNA_03_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a>
[Lord Durham had passed an Ordinance enacting that Papineau and
the leaders of the Canadian rebellion should be transported to Bermuda,
and that if any of them returned to Canada they should suffer death. This
was done before trial and without authority or law. It was consequently
attacked with great vehemence by Lord Brougham in the House of Lords,
on the 30th of July, and again on the 5th of August, and he brought in
a Bill declaring the true meaning and intent of the Canada Act. The
second reading was carried against the Government by a majority of eighteen,
and Ministers were compelled to disallow the Ordinance, the legality of
which could not, indeed, be defended.]</p></div>

<h3>August 11th, 1838</h3>

<p>Brougham introduced his Bill of Indemnity
(a Declaratory Bill) in an admirable speech, dignified, calm,
and ably reasoned. Melbourne was imprudent enough to
talk of &lsquo;a trap having been laid for Durham,&rsquo; at which the
Duke was very angry, and made a strong speech. Last
night they announced that they mean to let this Bill pass,
for that there is a necessity for some such Bill. It certainly
admits of a doubt whether Durham&rsquo;s Ordinance is illegal,
except as relates to transporting people to Bermuda, but it
is inexcusable that he should not have been better advised
and more cautious than to make any such blunder. We
were told that Turton&rsquo;s indifferent moral character was to be
overlooked in favour of his great legal capacity, and now it
appears that his law is not a jot better than his morals.</p>

<p>Yesterday I met Mr. Barnes at dinner for the purpose
of being introduced to him: an agreeable man enough, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
evidently a vast deal of information, but his conversation
bears no marks of that extraordinary vigour and pungency
for which the articles in the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; are so
distinguished.<a name="FNA_03_25" id="FNA_03_25"></a><a href="#FN_03_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

[Mr. Barnes was then chief editor of the &lsquo;Times.&rsquo; Mr. Greville
had long been in correspondence with him, but this was the first time
they met.]</p></div>

<h3>August 12th, 1838</h3>

<p>Lord Melbourne agreed to the Indemnity
Bill, but with many complaints of the bad effect the discussion
would have in Canada. Brougham was triumphant,
the Duke moderate and conciliatory. No doubt Brougham,
in hitting this blot, was animated with nothing but the
delight of firing a double shot into Durham there and the
Ministry here, and as to the consequences he cared not a
straw; but I am unable to perceive how it would have been
possible to pass the Ordinance <i>sub silentio</i>, its illegality being
clear, and so far from its being dangerous to discuss the
matter in Parliament, it is fortunate that the case occurred
before Parliament broke up, so that the necessary Acts may
pass to secure Durham and all others acting under his
authority from the consequences which might have arisen
from a later discovery of the irregularity of his proceedings;
for what might not have happened if this Ordinance had
been published during the recess and pronounced illegal
by high legal authority and taken up by the press? The
Government must have confirmed it on their own responsibility,
or disallowed it by their own authority; they would
not have dared do the first, and their disallowance would
have been fraught with as serious consequences as a parliamentary
condemnation. By Melbourne&rsquo;s own showing, and
for the reasons which he says induced him to agree to the
Bill&mdash;namely, that one part of the Ordinance is clearly illegal,
and that it is impossible to take one part and to reject
another&mdash;he ought himself to have come to Parliament for
an Indemnity Bill and a Declaratory Act. The question
resolves itself into this: what power would the Colonial
Legislature have had if the Act had not passed by which the
constitution was suspended? and would it have been competent
to do what Durham has done? Upon this point
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE ORDINANCE DISALLOWED.</span>
authorities differ, but everybody agrees that, whatever the
Colonial Legislature could have done, Durham (with his
Council) can do. If, however, Parliament did not think fit
to define his power, and great doubts exist as to its extent,
the reasonable, indeed the indispensable course seems to be
that those doubts should be as speedily as possible removed,
and the amount of his authority clearly and expressly ascertained.</p>

<h3>August 13th, 1838</h3>

<p>At a Council to-day to disallow Durham&rsquo;s
Ordinance. Nothing was sent from the Colonial Office, and
I did not know what it was for till I saw Lord Lansdowne.
He told me, and then I wrote the Order for the Queen to
approve, and he took it in to her. Presently Glenelg arrived,
and announced that nothing could be done, for the authenticated
copy under the Great Seal of the Colony was not arrived.
Then a consultation was held: Lord Lansdowne was for not
minding about the Great Seal, and Melbourne chuckled and
grunted, and said, &lsquo;Why, you knock over his Ordinances,
and he won&rsquo;t care about the form, will he?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;If
there is no precedent, make one,&rsquo; and accordingly the Order
passed. They are very angry with the House of Lords, and
Lord John said they had behaved very ill, and ought to
have waited till the whole case was before them: but I
think it <i>was</i> all before them.</p>

<h3>August 20th, 1838</h3>

<p>At Stoke on Saturday, where Lord Sefton
is sinking to the grave in a miserable state of depression
and mental debility. Up by the railroad and dined at
Holland House for the first time for above a year; sat next
to Lord FitzGerald at dinner, who lamented to me the loss of
the Corporation Bill; he said he would not have consented
to the lesser qualification, but would have agreed to all the
other clauses if he had had his own way. The continuance
of the trusts in the hands of the old Corporation he thought
unwise, calculated to offend feelings and prejudices, and
inconsistent with their own opinion of the corporators themselves.
Wharncliffe, on the other hand, told me some time
ago that he did not care about the qualification, but he
defended, though feebly, the trusts. This shows how dissatisfied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the moderate and sensible of the party are with
their own proceedings.</p>

<h3>August 23rd, 1838</h3>

<p>In looking back at the past Session, unexampled
in duration, the first thing that occurs to one is
how uneventful it has been, and how precisely the political
state of affairs has ended as it began. The characters of
certain conspicuous men have manifested themselves in a
very striking manner, but that is all; the Government are
still in their places, not a jot stronger than they were, and
the Opposition maintain their undiminished phalanx without
being at all nearer coming into power. The House of
Commons uniformly supports the Government, the House of
Lords frequently opposes it, but the difference between the
two Houses seldom swells to a dispute; it is languidly carried
on and carelessly regarded, the country at large not seeming
to mind who are in or who are out. The great meteor of the
year has been Brougham, who, by common consent, has given
proofs of the undiminished force of his wonderful capacity,
and who has spoken with as much, if not with greater
eloquence than at any previous period of his life. But while
he has excited no small degree of wonder and admiration, he
has not raised his reputation for wisdom or honesty. He has
exhibited such an unbridled rage against the Government,
he has appeared to be animated with so much spite and
malice, without a particle of public spirit, but only with a
vindictive determination to punish them for having rejected
him, that the world has only regarded him and his performances
as they would look at a great actor on the stage.
So bent has he been upon worrying the Ministers, so determined
his enmity to them, that he has sought to ally himself
with the most extreme sections of opposition, congregating
with the Roebucks, Wakleys, and Leaders in the morning,
contriving and concocting with them measures of ultra-Radicalism,
then hugging Lyndhurst, bowing down to the
Duke, courting the Tory lords, and figuring, flirting, and
palavering at night at the routs of the Tory ladies. In the
House of Lords, Lyndhurst was well content to hunt in
couples with him; but the Duke has kept him at arm&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">REVIEW OF THE SESSION.</span>
length, and though always on civil, would never be on
intimate terms with him. Far different has been the Duke&rsquo;s
own career, for he has, throughout the Session, displayed a
dignity, candour, and moderation, without any tameness or
indifference or inactivity, which raise him to the highest
rank as a statesman and a patriot, and show him equally
mindful of his own honour and his country&rsquo;s good. He
alone has moderated the rancour of Lyndhurst, kept in
check the violence of Brougham, and restrained the impetuosity
and impatience of his party. His abstinence from
opposition exceedingly provoked his followers, for, with the
exception of the question of the appointment of magistrates
by the Chancellor, upon which he treated the latter with
considerable asperity, and blamed his conduct severely, he
displayed uniform leniency and forbearance; at the end of
the session, indeed, he supported Brougham in his attack
upon Durham, though not by any means joining in it with
the same <i>animus</i>. Melbourne, very soon after the commencement
of the session, openly, avowedly, and intentionally
quarrelled with Brougham and set him at defiance. However
unequal to him on the whole, he came off tolerably well
in the little skirmishes which constantly took place between
them, and he derived a strength and security from the
Duke&rsquo;s forbearance or support, which enabled him to jog on
without sustaining any material damage from Brougham&rsquo;s
terrible assaults. None of his colleagues were of much use
to him, and Glenelg got so cruelly mauled at first, that he
had afterwards no mind to mingle more than he could help
in the fray.</p>

<p>In the House of Commons the debates have been much
less interesting and exciting than in the House of Lords.
John Russell has continued steadily to advance in public
estimation as a speaker and political leader, and Morpeth
and Sir George Grey have taken higher places, while Rice
and Thomson have lost ground, and Hobhouse has sunk
into utter insignificance. Peel has, throughout the Session,
acted a moderate, cautious part, and Stanley and Graham
have said and done little or nothing, both parties, as if by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
common consent, keeping each other at bay, and alike
conscious that their relative strength is too equal to admit of
any great triumph on either side. This balance of parties
keeps the Ministers in place, but keeps them weak and
nearly powerless either for good or for evil. It has not,
however, had the effect of exalting the third party (the
Radical), which has, on the contrary, sunk in numbers,
reputation, and influence. The conduct of the ultra-Radicals
in the House of Commons, on the outbreak of the Canadian
insurrection, revealed their real disposition and disgusted the
country, and, <i>for the present</i>, nothing can be lower than the
Radical interest, or more feeble and innocuous than the
revolutionary principle. The great mass of the Tories are
always fretting and fuming at the Whigs retaining possession
of office, and are impatient to assault them in front, and
indignant that they do not of their own accord resign, but
the wiser and the cooler know that however weak the Whigs
may be as a Government, and however insufficient their
power to execute all they would like to do, they are fortified
in their places by certain barriers which their adversaries
are still more powerless to break through; for they have the
cordial, undoubted support of the Queen, they are the
Ministers of her choice, and they have a majority (a small
but a clear and a certain majority) in the House of Commons.
A great Tory principle therefore coalesces with a great Whig
principle to maintain them in office; for the Tories,&mdash;who
were indignant at what they considered an invasion of the
King&rsquo;s prerogative in 1835, when the House of Commons
would not let him choose his own Ministers, or, which is the
same thing, so continually thwarted the Ministers of his
choice as to compel them to resign, and left him no alternative
but that of taking back those whom he had dismissed&mdash;the
Tories could not with any consistency deny to the Queen
the exercise of the same authority sanctioned by the support
of the House of Commons, which they claimed for King
William even against the declared opinion of the House.
Nothing is left for them, therefore, but a sulky acquiescence
in the present state of things; but they indemnify themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">OPPOSITION IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</span>
by placing the House of Lords in the new position
of an assailant of the Queen&rsquo;s Government, and the Peers,
without daring to assert any co-ordinate authority with the
House of Commons as to the choice of Ministers, evince
their disapprobation of that choice by frequently thwarting
their most important measures. It is curious that none of
them&mdash;not even Lyndhurst himself, perhaps not the Duke of
Wellington&mdash;seems to perceive that in the midst of their
horror of innovation and dread of great constitutional
changes, they have themselves made a great practical change
in the constitutional functions of the House of Lords; that it
is a departure from the character and proper province of
that House to array itself in permanent and often bitter
hostility to the Government, and to persist in continually
rejecting measures recommended by the Crown and passed
by the Commons. When the House of Lords opposed and
thwarted the Ministers during the last two years of King
William&rsquo;s reign, they may have justified themselves on their
own Tory principle, and (assuming as a fact that the King
was in the hands of a faction, from whose bondage he could
not release himself), that they were only supporting the
Crown when they opposed the Ministers whom the House of
Commons had forced upon him, and therefore, both as Tories
and as Conservatives, they were taking a consistent, constitutional,
and prudent course; but even if this was true
then, it is certainly not true now, and it is, I believe, the
first time that there is no party in the House of Lords
supporting the Crown, nor any individual acting upon that
principle, but all are either Whigs or Tories arrayed against
each other and battling for power.</p>

<h3>September 7th, 1838</h3>

<p>Nothing to record of any sort or
kind: London a desert; I went to-day to Windsor for a
Council, was invited by the Queen (through Melbourne) to
stay and dine, but made an excuse on the score of business,
and luckily had a plausible one to make.</p>

<h3>September 12th, 1838</h3>

<p>George Villiers, who came from Windsor
on Monday, told me he had been exceedingly struck with
Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s manner to the Queen, and hers to him: his,
so parental and anxious, but always so respectful and deferential;
hers, indicative of such entire confidence, such pleasure
in his society. She is continually talking to him; let who will
be there, he always sits next her at dinner, and evidently by
arrangement, because he always takes in the lady-in-waiting,
which necessarily places him next her, the etiquette being
that the lady-in-waiting sits next but one to the Queen. It
is not unnatural, and to him it is peculiarly interesting. I
have no doubt he is passionately fond of her as he might be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE QUEEN AND LORD MELBOURNE.</span>
of his daughter if he had one, and the more because he is
a man with a capacity for loving without having anything
in the world to love. It is become his province to educate,
instruct, and form the most interesting mind and character
in the world. No occupation was ever more engrossing
or involved greater responsibility. I have no doubt that
Melbourne is both equal to and worthy of the task, and that
it is fortunate she has fallen into his hands, and that he
discharges this great duty wisely, honourably, and conscientiously.
There are, however, or rather may be hereafter,
inconveniences in the establishment of such an intimacy,
and in a connexion of so close and affectionate a nature between
the young Queen and her Minister; for whenever the
Government, which hangs by a thread, shall be broken up,
the parting will be painful, and their subsequent relations
will not be without embarrassment to themselves, nor fail to
be the cause of jealousy in others. It is a great proof of the
discretion and purity of his conduct and behaviour, that he
is admired, respected, and liked by all the Court.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to Battersea and dined with Robert Eden, the
Rector,<a name="FNA_04_01" id="FNA_04_01"></a><a href="#FN_04_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and he took me before dinner to see his
lions, and introduced me to scenes very different from those
which I am used to see. We went to different manufactories,
a saw-mill, a pottery, to the lunatic asylum, to the workhouse,
and we visited several poor people at their cottages,
when he enquired into the circumstances of the sick or the
indigent; but what struck me most forcibly was the school
(upon Bell&rsquo;s system) and the extraordinary acquirements of
the boys. Eden examined them, and invited me to do so, in
arithmetic, geography, English history, and the Bible, and
their readiness and correctness were really surprising. I
doubt whether many of the children of the rich, who are
educated at a vast expense at private or public schools, could
pass such an examination as these young paupers who are
instructed at the cost of about one guinea a year. The
greatest punishment that can be inflicted on one of these
boys is to banish him from school, such delight do they take
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
in acquiring knowledge. He gave me a curious account of
the state of his parish: there is no middle class of tradesmen
in good circumstances; they are divided between the
extremes of wealth and of poverty, masters and operatives;
but amongst the latter there is a considerable amount of
knowledge, though their minds are ill-regulated and their
principles perverted. When first he came there the place
abounded in disciples of Carlile, pure atheists, and when
Carlile was in prison he was supported by their contributions;
but though totally without religion they were not
immoral, and among these men were some of the best
husbands and fathers in the place, so much so that when
Carlile told them that men might indulge in polygamy and
take two wives, they were scandalised and disgusted, and
began immediately to abandon him. Some were reclaimed
and came to church, but the greater part, who required some
powerful excitement, sought it in politics, and became deeply
imbued with the most pernicious principles of hatred against
all institutions, against the higher orders, and against property.
The fountain from which they draw their opinions is
a Sunday paper called the &lsquo;Watchman,&rsquo; which is universally
and greedily read: it is cleverly written, accommodated to
their taste, and flatters all their worst propensities. Few
people know these things and are aware of the poison that is
thus circulating through the veins, and corrupting the blood,
of the social mass. The desire for instruction and knowledge
seems very general among the lower orders. Eden,
with some others, has established evening lectures upon
various subjects, which are crowded by anxious and attentive
listeners of all ages and callings, who frequently hurry from
their daily occupations, impatient to partake of the instruction
which Eden and his curates, and often some of the
better informed inhabitants of the place, are in the habit of
dispensing.</p>

<p>Yesterday again at Windsor for a
Council. I had made up my mind not to stay if invited, and
meant to hasten away; but before I could do so Melbourne
came after me and said, &lsquo;You will stay here? the Queen desired
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">AN INVITATION TO WINDSOR.</span>
me to ask you.&rsquo; I said I had no evening dress, had come
by the railroad, and walked from Slough; could not assume
that I should be asked, and did not know what to do. He
said, &lsquo;She meant it as a civility, and thought you would
like it.&rsquo; There was a sort of reproach conveyed in the
tone, and that induced me to say, &lsquo;So I should if I had only
known of it, but as it is I can send for my things if you
like.&rsquo; He ended by desiring I would do what I liked best
myself, promised that he would take care the Queen was not
offended, and that nobody else would know anything of the
matter. I accordingly resolved to go, and went away with
Lord Albemarle. My mind misgave me, and I had a great
mind to stay, especially as Lord Albemarle told me they did
not mean to turn me out after dinner, but that sleeping
there was a matter of course. Then I was sorry I had not
stayed, which I might just as well have done, for I had
nothing else to do. At these Councils we meet in common
morning dress, which we used not to do.</p>

<h3>London, October 26th, 1838</h3>

<p>A blank month: to Newmarket, to
Buckenham, back to Newmarket, to Cromer (fine, wild, bleak
coast), Buckenham again, Newmarket, London, Norman
Court, and here again; heard nothing, learnt nothing, altogether
unprofitable, Durham&rsquo;s
resignation<a name="FNA_04_02" id="FNA_04_02"></a><a href="#FN_04_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
the only event, the <i>dénouement</i> of which nobody can guess. The Ministers
ought never to have sent him, knowing what he was, and
this has not been their only fault. Norman
Court<a name="FNA_04_03" id="FNA_04_03"></a><a href="#FN_04_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
is a very enjoyable place; close to it was (for it has lately been pulled
down) the house from which Lady Mary eloped with Mr.
Wortley. There I met the doctor who attended young Sam
Day (who won the St. Leger for me on Mango) after the
fall of which he died, and he gave me a striking account
of the deathbed scene, the actors in which, albeit of an
humble and unpolished class, displayed feelings not the less
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
intense from the simplicity of their expression, and the total
absence of that morbid or conventional sensibility which
gives a sort of dramatic dignity to the grief of the great
ones. The boy himself died like a hero, with a firmness,
courage, and cheerfulness which would have been extolled to
the skies in some conspicuous character on whom the world
has been accustomed to gaze, but which in the poor jockey
boy passed unheeded and unknown, and it is only the few as
obscure as himself who witnessed his last moments who are
aware that, wherever his bones rest&mdash;</p>

<h3>November 8th, 1838</h3>

<p>At Newmarket, and at Euston for a day
(probably for the last time), and to London on Monday. The
stillness of the political atmosphere has been rudely broken in
upon by Lord Durham&rsquo;s astounding Proclamation: for once
the whole of the press has joined in a full chorus of disapprobation,
and this may be considered conclusive as to public
opinion. Indeed there can scarcely be two opinions on the
subject, for such an appeal to the people of the Colony over
whom he is placed from the acts of the Government and the
legislature of the mother country is as monstrous as it is
unexampled.<a name="FNA_04_04" id="FNA_04_04"></a><a href="#FN_04_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
It seems incredible that he should not have been
deterred by the men who are about him, who are not deficient
in capacity, from taking this desperate step; but as there is
little doubt that Turton advised him not to issue the Ordinances,
and got into disgrace with him for so doing, it is
possible that they none of them were consulted, or if consulted
did not dare, or did not choose, to give him any advice
whatever. The dignity of the Government now demands
that his insolence and misconduct should be visited with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WELLINGTON IN BATTLE.</span>
severest expression of disapprobation and reproof, and the
harshest measures, even an impeachment, would be fully
warrantable, if harsh measures did not generally defeat their
own object. But if the Government mince matters with him,
and evince any fear to strike, if they do not vindicate their
own authority, and punish his contumacy with dignity and
spirit, their characters are gone, and they will merit all the
contempt with which their opponents affect to treat them.</p>

[Lord Durham&rsquo;s conduct was arrogant and highly injudicious. On
the 9th October he issued a Proclamation in Canada, in which he censured
the conduct of the Home Government. It is printed in the &lsquo;Ann. Reg.&rsquo;
for 1838, Chron. p. 311. In fact his vanity was wounded, and his mission,
of which so much was expected, had failed. But it will be seen further on
that the first impression produced by his violence was considerably mitigated.
Mr. John Stuart Mill defended his policy in the <i>Westminster Review</i>, and a
certain amount of reaction took place in his favour.]</p></div>

<h3>November 18th, 1838, Wolbeding</h3>

<p>Came here to-day and brought Lord Fitzroy
Somerset<a name="FNA_04_05" id="FNA_04_05"></a><a href="#FN_04_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
with me, who told me a great deal
about the Duke and their old campaigns. He never saw a
man so cool and indifferent to danger, at the same time
without any personal rashness or bravado, never putting
himself in unnecessary danger, never avoiding any that was
necessary. He was close to the Duke, his left arm touching
the Duke&rsquo;s right, when he was shot in the arm at Waterloo,
and so was Lord Anglesey when he received his wound in
the leg. When Lord Anglesey was shot he turned to the
Duke and said, &lsquo;By G&mdash; I have lost my leg.&rsquo; The Duke
replied, &lsquo;Have you? by G&mdash;.&rsquo; The only time the Duke
ever was hit was at Orthez, by a spent ball, which struck
him on the side and knocked him down. He and Alava
were standing together having both dismounted, and they
were laughing at a Portuguese soldier who had just passed
by saying he was &lsquo;offendido&rsquo; ... when the Duke was
struck down, but he immediately rose and laughed all the
more at being &lsquo;offendido&rsquo; himself. During the battles of
the Pyrenees Cole proposed to the Duke and his staff to go
and eat a very good dinner he had ordered for himself at his
house in the village he occupied, as he could not leave his
division. They went and dined, and then the Duke went
into the next room and threw himself upon a bed without
a mattress, on the boards of which he presently went to
sleep with his despatch-box for a pillow. Fitzroy and the
aides-de-camp slept in chairs or on the floor scattered about.
Presently arrived, in great haste and alarm, two officers of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
artillery, Captain Cairne and another, who begged to see the
Duke, the former saying that he had just brought up some
guns from the rear, and that he had suddenly found himself
close to the enemy and did not know what to do. They
went and woke the Duke, who desired him to be brought in.
The officer entered and told his story, when the Duke said,
very composedly, &lsquo;Well, Sir, you are certainly in a very bad
position, and you must get out of it in the best way you can,&rsquo;
turned round, and was asleep again in a moment.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_04_05" id="FN_04_05"></a><a href="#FNA_04_05"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
[Afterwards Lord Raglan. He lost his arm at Waterloo, and commanded
the British army in the Crimea, where he died in 1855.]</p></div>

<p>Lord Fitzroy gave me an account of the battle of Salamanca,
exactly corresponding with that which the Duke himself
gave me last year at Burghley, but with some additional
details. They were going to dine in a farmyard, but the shot
fell so thick there that the mules carrying the dinner were
ordered to go to another place. There the Duke dined,
walking about the whole time munching, with his field-glass in
his hand, and constantly looking through it. On a sudden,
he exclaimed, &lsquo;By G&mdash;, they are extending their line; order
my horses.&rsquo; The horses were brought and he was off in an
instant, followed only by his old German dragoon, who went
with him everywhere. The aides-de-camp followed as quickly
as they could. He galloped straight to Pakenham&rsquo;s division
and desired him immediately to begin the attack. Pakenham
said, &lsquo;Give me your hand, and it shall be done.&rsquo; The
Duke very gravely gave him his hand, Pakenham shook it
warmly and then hastened off. The French were attacked
directly after.</p>

<p>He also told me another anecdote I had never heard
before. During the retreat from Burgos, on this very day
twenty-six years ago, when the weather was dreadful and
the roads were nearly impassable, the Duke <i>lost his army</i> for
several hours. They had to cross a river near a place called
Rodrigo, and the Duke had ordered the army to march in
three columns, of which one, composed of the Spaniards,
was to cross by the only bridge there was, and the other two
by fords and by another route. He had assigned the easiest
line to the Spaniards because they were likely to have more
stragglers than the British. Arthur Upton, the Quartermaster-General
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">AN ARMY LOST.</span>
of one of the divisions, had dined at head-quarters
the night before, and the Duke had sent by him
written orders for the march. The next morning at two
o&rsquo;clock the Duke was on the high road on purpose to see the
troops pass by. Cavalry came, but no infantry, and to the
enquiries the Duke made, they all replied that they had not
seen anything of the infantry. Presently the Duke galloped
off, and Fitzroy having missed him soon after, set off to see
if he could discover what was become of the infantry. It
was not till several hours after that he joined the Duke, who
had at last found out the cause of the non-appearance of his
infantry. The three Generals commanding the divisions,
Clinton, Stewart, and Lord Dalhousie, had thought fit to
disobey his orders, and as a great deal of rain had fallen in
the night, they had settled that it would be better to direct
the whole of the infantry on the bridge instead of moving
them by the roads prescribed by the Duke, and though they
knew he was only seven or eight miles off, they never
advised him of their having made this change in the movements
he had ordered. The enemy did not discover what
had occurred; if they had, the consequences might have been
very serious, and a great loss have ensued. Fitzroy asked
the Duke what he had said to them, and he replied, &lsquo;Oh, by
G&mdash;, it was too serious to say anything.&rsquo; It was too late
then to restore the original order of march, and the whole
army crossed by the bridge. No further allusion was made
to what had occurred.</p>

<h3>December 2nd, 1838</h3>

<p>Went from Wolbeding to the Grange,
last Friday week&mdash;Henry Taylor and George Cornewall
Lewis there&mdash;and came to town on Sunday. The Grange
is a beautiful specimen of Grecian architecture, bought by
Lord Ashburton of that extraordinary man Henry Drummond,
a man so able and eccentric as to be treading on
the very edge of the partition which divides wit from madness.</p>

<p>Lord Durham arrived at Plymouth some days ago, but
was not able to land (on Thursday last) owing to the violence
of the storms. Great curiosity prevails to see what sort of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
reception he gets from Ministers and the Queen, and what
his relations are to be with Government. Nothing they say
can exceed the astonishment which he and his court feel, or
will feel, at the sensation excited in the country by his conduct.
Gibbon Wakefield, the first who arrived, said he had
never been so amazed in the course of his life, and owned
that they had all expected to make a very different impression,
and to be hailed with great applause. Brougham, who
is sitting at the Judicial Committee, is in high spirits and
looking forward with exceeding zest and eagerness to the
fun he is to have in the House of Lords.</p>

<p>While I was in the country, Lord Sefton&rsquo;s long illness
came to a close, but not before he was reduced to a state of
deplorable imbecility, so that his death was a release from
misery to himself as well as to all about him. He was a
man who filled a considerable space in society, and had been
more or less conspicuous from the earliest period of his life.
He was possessed of an ample fortune, which he endeavoured
to convert into a continual source of enjoyment in every
mode which fancy, humour, or caprice suggested. His natural
parts were excessively lively, but his education had
been wholly neglected, and he never attempted to repair in
after-life the deficiencies occasioned by that early neglect.
He had therefore not the slightest tincture of letters, his
mind was barren of information, and he not only took no
interest in intellectual pursuits, but he regarded with aversion,
and something like contempt, those who were peculiarly
devoted to them. On the other hand, he was an acute man
of the world, eagerly entering into all the interests, great
and small, of his own time, sufficiently acquainted with the
mushroom literature of the day for all social purposes, and,
partly from the authority which his wealth and position
gave him, partly from his own dexterity, he contrived to turn
conversation aside from those topics in the discussion of
which he was incapable of mixing, and to promote that sort
of half-serious, half-ludicrous talk, in which he was not only
fitted to play a prominent part, but in which he exhibited a
talent quite peculiar to himself. Never was there so great a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CHARACTER OF LORD SEFTON.</span>
master of what is called <i>persiflage</i>&mdash;of that boisterous, droll
and pungent banter which, if not the most elevated species
of wit, is certainly that which is most exhilarating and provocative
of laughter. In this he was unrivalled, and it was
heightened by the adjuncts of a voice, face, and manner
irresistibly comical. As the most opposite characters owned
the fascination of this exciting talent, he was enabled to
gratify his inclination for every variety of social excellence,
and to number among his friends and companions many of
the most eminent and accomplished men of his time. From
his earliest youth he had always lived in what was considered
the very best society, and as he eschewed the idea of growing
old and retiring from the stage, he was continually
making new acquaintances, falling into fresh pursuits, and
adapting himself to the prevailing tastes and habits of the
day. His father had stamped upon him his hideous form,
but with it his sharp and caustic wit; he found himself at
the outset a member of that brilliant society of which Hatfield
and Cashiobury were the temples, and Lady Salisbury,
Lady Essex, and Mrs. St. John the presiding divinities. After
these had flourished and decayed, Sefton struck into fresh
paths of social enjoyment, and having successively sought for
amusement in hunting, shooting, racing, gaming, &lsquo;besides
ten thousand freaks that died in thinking,&rsquo; he plunged with
ardour into politics, and though he had no opinions or principles
but such as resulted from personal predilections, and
had none of that judgement which can only be generated by
the combination of knowledge with severe mental discipline,
he was enabled by the force of circumstances and an energetic
will to acquire political intimacies, and to a certain
degree to play a political part: of this his friendship with
Brougham was the primary cause. Brougham had been his
counsel in some important cause at Liverpool, and that professional
connexion subsequently ripened into a close alliance,
Sefton being naturally delighted with his brilliant
conversation, while Brougham was always highly diverted
with the peculiar humour and drollery of Sefton. So intimate
therefore did they become, and such influence was Sefton
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
supposed to possess over his mind, that he was employed by
Lord Grey, on the formation of the Whig Government in
1830, to settle the conditions of Brougham&rsquo;s accession to
office, and to appease the wrath which had been stirred up
in his mind by the offer of being made Attorney-General.
His addiction to politics had, however, very little influence
on his habits, except to extend and diversify the sphere of
his occupations and amusements. His Parliamentary attendance
never abridged the hours or nights which were
devoted to Crockford&rsquo;s, and his friendships with Brougham,
Lord Grey and Lord Holland, Talleyrand, and all the most
distinguished people in the country, did not alienate him
from the company of the idle, gay, and dissolute frequenters
of clubs and race-courses, congenial spirits from
whom he extracted their several contributions of entertainment.
The one thing needful to him was excitement, and
so fixed and rooted was his habit of seeking it, that there
was a sort of regularity in the very irregularities of his existence.
In regard to his moral attributes he was governed by
an intense selfishness, but of that liberal and enlightened
character which throws a partial veil over the vice itself
and leaves the superficial observer unconscious of its existence.
He was a devoted husband, a kind and affectionate
father, a despot (though it was a beneficent despotism) in his
own family, a courteous, cordial, and obliging host; he cared
for money only as a means of enjoyment, but it formed no
part of his scheme of happiness to employ it in promoting
the pleasures, or relieving the necessities of others, except
in so far as such pleasures were connected with his own
gratification. He was absolutely devoid of religious belief
or opinions, but he left to all others the unquestioned liberty
of rendering that homage to religion from which he gave
himself a plenary dispensation. His general conduct was
stained with no gross immorality, and as he was placed far
above the necessity of committing dishonourable actions, his
mind was habitually imbued with principles of integrity.
They sat, however, lightly and easily upon him as regarded
the conduct of others, not so much from indifference as from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD DURHAM&rsquo;S RETURN.</span>
indulgence in those particular cases where a rigid and severe
application of high principle would have interfered with his
own convenience or enjoyment. Such was Sefton, a man
who acted too conspicuous a part on the stage of the world
to be passed over without notice, whom I knew too well to
delineate in more flattering terms, but to whom I must
acknowledge a debt of gratitude for a long and undeviating
course of kind and cordial hospitality experienced for many
years.</p>

<h3>December 6th, 1838</h3>

<p>If notoriety upon any terms could satisfy
anybody, Lord Durham would have ample reason for contentment,
as his name is in everybody&rsquo;s mouth, and the chief
topic of every newspaper and political periodical. He was
detained by the storms on board his ship for a day or
two, and met on his landing by a Devonport address, to
which he returned a rather mysterious answer (talking of the
great disclosures he had to make), with a reference to his
Glasgow speech in which in &rsquo;34 he announced his Radical
tendency. The most interesting question is how he and the
Ministers will go on together, what they ought to do, and
how he will take their usage of him whatever it may be. He
has been in no hurry to come to town, and has reposed himself
at Plymouth as long as it suited him; but he is expected
to-day. Brougham, who is sitting every day at the Privy
Council, is always growling at him sarcastically, and was
much pleased when news came of the fresh outbreak in
Canada, and his disappointment was equally evident when
he heard it was so rapidly quelled. He was reading the newspaper
in my room before the Court opened, when Denman
came and announced that he had just met Charles Wood,
who had told him that young Ellice was released, and the
insurrection suppressed. Brougham did not take his eyes off
the paper, and merely muttered, &lsquo;It will soon break out
again.&rsquo; He is all day long working sums in algebra, or
extracting cube-roots; and while he pretends to be poring
over the great book (the cases of the parties) before him, he
is in reality absorbed in his own calculations. Nevertheless,
he from time to time starts up, and throws in a question,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
a dictum, or a lecture, just as if he had been profoundly
attentive.</p>

<h3>December 10th, 1838</h3>

<p>Nothing can exhibit more strikingly the
farcical nature of public meetings, and the hollowness, worthlessness,
and accidental character of popularity, than the
circumstances of Durham&rsquo;s arrival here. He has done nothing
in Canada, he took himself off just as the fighting
was going to begin, his whole conduct has been visited with
universal disapprobation, and nevertheless his progress to
London has been a sort of triumph; and he has been saluted
with addresses and noisy receptions at all the great towns
through which he passed. His position here is extraordinary
enough, and his relations with the Government stand upon
a strange footing. They have made no communication to
him since his arrival. Upon the receipt of his Proclamation
they wrote to him and expressed their disapprobation, but
those letters never reached him, as he quitted Canada before
they could have arrived. They now, it seems, consider that
silence is token sufficient of their displeasure at his abrupt
return; but, though no doubt he fully understands them,
they ought to have conveyed their sentiments openly and
distinctly. There is an appearance of pusillanimity in this
reserve which does them great harm, and brings them into
discredit. They ought to have told him temperately, but
firmly, that they were entirely dissatisfied with his proceedings,
and having so done they should have called upon
him to afford them all the explanations and all the information
he has to give; but they have done none of this, for they
have taken no notice of him, nor he of them. He has not
seen one of the Ministers, not even his own brother-in-law
Howick, nor any of the underlings, except Ben Stanley, who
found Durham in high dudgeon, and saying, that &lsquo;as Government
attacked him he must defend himself.&rsquo; What he
means by &lsquo;attacking him&rsquo; is, that certain articles reflecting
on his conduct have appeared in the &lsquo;Globe,&rsquo; for in no way
have Government said or done anything about him; on the
contrary, they have been only too reserved and forbearing.</p>

<p>The conduct of Durham throughout the whole business,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD DURHAM BLUNDERS.</span>
from his first legislative act in Canada (the Ordinance) down
to his arrival in London, is perfectly inexplicable, and presents
a series of blunders tricked out in plausible language, invested
with the dignity of pompous phraseology, mysterious allusions,
threats and promises, and the affecting complaints of
injured innocence and ill-requited virtue. But still, such
is the effect of notoriety, so dearly do ordinary mortals love
to play a part and &lsquo;make the capable,&rsquo; that in spite of his
blunders and his faults he has contrived to excite a certain
amount of interest, to make an impression, though not a
very deep or wide one, and to raise a vague expectation as
to his promised disclosures. His speeches in reply to the
addresses are most extraordinary performances, unbecoming
in tone, contradictory, inconsistent, and inflated; for as to
disclosures he has none to make of any sort or kind. He
had the finest game to play in Canada that could be placed
in his hands, for the proceedings here gave him a legitimate
grievance, and would have enabled him to claim double credit
for success, and exemption from any blame or discredit from
failure; but temper, uncontrollable and unreflecting, hurried
him into the irretrievable follies he committed, and he
is now without any alternative but that of renewing the
Radical connexion from which a short time ago he evinced
a disposition to keep aloof, and he has nothing left for it but
to accept the post that is offered him of leading a party
which, in its composition, principles, and objects, is as uncongenial
as possible to his real character and disposition.
For it is not a little curious that this levelling democratic
faction, to whom the aristocracy are an abomination, are
not only wild to have a lord for their leader, but must
have that lord who is the especial incarnation of all those
odious qualities which they ascribe most unjustly to the
order of which he is a member: and he who is brimful
of pride and arrogance, and of an overweening sense of his
greatness and his rank, is content to associate with men
whose chief recommendation is the profuseness with which
they pander to his vanity, and to seek personal distinction
and power by lending himself to the promotion of schemes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the success of which no man would more earnestly deprecate
than himself. The greatest enigma is how Durham has ever
come to be considered of such importance, and what is the
cause of the sort of reputation he has acquired; for whatever
may be his intrinsic value, he certainly fills a considerable
space, attracts a great share of public attention, and is a personage
of some consequence in the political world. He is a
clever man, can both write and speak well, but he has not
been in the habit of <i>saying</i> much, and he has never <i>done</i>
anything whatever. He is known to the world by no specific
act, and he has taken part very rarely and occasionally
in the debates in Parliament. All that is known of his
embassy to Russia is, that he was completely bit by the Emperor
Nicholas, and gave up the question of the &lsquo;Vixen;&rsquo;
still, by dint of being perpetually cried up by a particular
party, and by doing well the little he has occasionally done
in public, he has succeeded in making himself pass for a man
of high pretensions and uncommon endowments, and in the
present state of parties his arrival may be productive of
important effects.</p>

<p>The Radicals, that is, the English ones, are extremely
exasperated against the Government, and many of them are
anxious to terminate the Whig reign, from which they think
it vain to expect anything after John Russell&rsquo;s declaration,
and to try their chance with the Tories: not that they expect
to find the Tories squeezable, but they fancy that a Tory
Government will fail, and, after its failure, that recourse
must be had to them. The wiser heads of the party know
that these notions are quite chimerical, and are for trusting
to the chapter of accidents and letting the present Cabinet
remain in. The consequence is, that there is great dissension
and vast difference of opinion among them; they have
no leader, and there is no individual who influences the determinations
of the whole body. On the other side of the water,
O&rsquo;Connell has likewise threatened to insist upon ballot as the
condition of his support to Government; but nobody pays
any attention to his harangues or the menaces they contain,
and his support may be pretty well depended on. But it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">IRRITATION OF THE RADICALS.</span>
would not be enough for Government that the English Radicals
should abstain from going against them in a body, because
so slender is the majority on which they can count, that if
any considerable number were to oppose Government on some
vital question, it would be sufficient to overthrow them. Of
this they are aware, as well as of the probability of such
defection, and the consequent precariousness of their situation,
and many among them are beginning to be very tired
and disgusted with such a tenure of office. It is difficult to
believe that Melbourne would not be more so than anybody,
if it were not that he is bound by every sentiment of duty,
gratitude, and attachment to the Queen to retain the Government
as long as he can with honour and safety, and to
stretch a point even, to spare her the pain and mortification
of changes that would be so painful to her. The Tories, who
see the accumulating difficulties of the Government, and who
are aware of the immense importance of letting it dissolve
of itself, or be broken up by the defection and opposition
of its own supporters, are disposed to be patient and moderate;
that is, the more sagacious of them are; but they are
always in danger of being prematurely urged on by the violence
and impetuosity of their tail. Such is the state of
parties at the present moment, and it would puzzle the most
sagacious observer and most experienced actor in political
life to predict the result of the ensuing session. There is
quite enough, however, in the general aspect of affairs both
at home and abroad to moderate the rancour of mere party
violence.</p>

<h3>December 15th, 1838</h3>

<p>Went on Wednesday to a Council at
Windsor, and after the Council was invited to stay that
night; rode with the Queen, and after riding Melbourne came
to me and said Her Majesty wished me to stay the next day
also. This was very gracious and very considerate, because
it was done for the express purpose of showing that she was
not displeased at my not staying when asked on a former
occasion, and as she can have no object whatever in being
civil to me, it was a proof of her good-nature and thoughtfulness
about other people&rsquo;s little vanities, even those of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
most insignificant. Accordingly I remained till Friday
morning, when I went with the rest of her suite to see the
hounds throw off, which she herself saw for the first time.
The Court is certainly not gay, but it is perhaps impossible
that any Court should be gay where there is no social
equality; where some ceremony, and a continual air of deference
and respect must be observed, there can be no ease,
and without ease there can be no real pleasure. The Queen
is natural, good-humoured, and cheerful, but still she is
Queen, and by her must the social habits and the tone of
conversation be regulated, and for this she is too young and
inexperienced. She sits at a large round table, her guests
around it, and Melbourne always in a chair beside her, where
two mortal hours are consumed in such conversation as can
be found, which appears to be, and really is, very up-hill
work. This, however, is the only bad part of the whole; the
rest of the day is passed without the slightest constraint,
trouble, or annoyance to anybody; each person is at liberty
to employ himself or herself as best pleases them, though
very little is done in common, and in this respect Windsor
is totally unlike any other place. There is none of the sociability
which makes the agreeableness of an English country
house; there is no room in which the guests assemble, sit,
lounge, and talk as they please and when they please;
there is a billiard table, but in such a remote corner of the
Castle that it might as well be in the town of Windsor; and
there is a library well stocked with books, but hardly accessible,
imperfectly warmed, and only tenanted by the librarian:
it is a mere library, too, unfurnished, and offering none of
the comforts and luxuries of a habitable room. There are
two breakfast rooms, one for the ladies and the guests, and
the other for the equerries, but when the meal is over everybody
disperses, and nothing but another meal reunites the
company, so that, in fact, there is no society whatever, little
trouble, little etiquette, but very little resource or amusement.</p>

<p>The life which the Queen leads is this: she gets up soon
after eight o&rsquo;clock, breakfasts in her own room, and is employed
the whole morning in transacting business; she reads
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LIFE OF THE QUEEN AT WINDSOR.</span>
all the despatches, and has every matter of interest and importance
in every department laid before her. At eleven or
twelve Melbourne comes to her and stays an hour, more or
less, according to the business he may have to transact. At
two she rides with a large suite (and she likes to have it
numerous); Melbourne always rides on her left hand, and
the equerry in waiting generally on her right; she rides for
two hours along the road, and the greater part of the time at
a full gallop; after riding she amuses herself for the rest of
the afternoon with music and singing, playing, romping with
children, if there are any in the Castle (and she is so fond of
them that she generally contrives to have some there), or in
any other way she fancies. The hour of dinner is nominally
half-past seven o&rsquo;clock, soon after which time the guests
assemble, but she seldom appears till near eight. The
lord in waiting comes into the drawing-room and instructs
each gentleman which lady he is to take in to dinner. When
the guests are all assembled the Queen comes in, preceded
by the gentlemen of her household, and followed by the
Duchess of Kent and all her ladies; she speaks to each lady,
bows to the men, and goes immediately into the dining-room.
She generally takes the arm of the man of the highest
rank, but on this occasion she went with Mr. Stephenson,
the American Minister (though he has no rank), which was
very wisely done. Melbourne invariably sits on her left, no
matter who may be there; she remains at table the usual
time, but does not suffer the men to sit long after her, and
we were summoned to coffee in less than a quarter of an hour.
In the drawing-room she never sits down till the men make
their appearance. Coffee is served to them in the adjoining
room, and then they go into the drawing-room, when she
goes round and says a few words to each, of the most trivial
nature, all however very civil and cordial in manner and
expression. When this little ceremony is over the Duchess
of Kent&rsquo;s whist table is arranged, and then the round table
is marshalled, Melbourne invariably sitting on the left
hand of the Queen and remaining there without moving till
the evening is at an end. At about half-past eleven she goes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to bed, or whenever the Duchess has played her usual
number of rubbers, and the band have performed all the
pieces on their list for the night. This is the whole history
of her day: she orders and regulates every detail herself, she
knows where everybody is lodged in the Castle, settles about
the riding or driving, and enters into every particular with
minute attention. But while she personally gives her orders
to her various attendants, and does everything that is civil
to all the inmates of the Castle, she really has nothing to do
with anybody but Melbourne, and with him she passes (if not
in <i>tête-à-tête</i> yet in intimate communication) more hours than
any two people, in any relation of life, perhaps ever do pass together
besides.<a name="FNA_04_06" id="FNA_04_06"></a><a href="#FN_04_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
He is at her side for at least six hours
every day&mdash;an hour in the morning, two on horseback, one at
dinner, and two in the evening. This monopoly is certainly
not judicious; it is not altogether consistent with social
usage, and it leads to an infraction of those rules of etiquette
which it is better to observe with regularity at Court. But
it is more peculiarly inexpedient with reference to her own
future enjoyment, for if Melbourne should be compelled to
resign, her privation will be the more bitter on account of the
exclusiveness of her intimacy with him. Accordingly, her
terror when any danger menaces the Government, her nervous
apprehension at any appearance of change, affect her
health, and upon one occasion during the last session she
actually fretted herself into an illness at the notion of their
going out. It must be owned that her feelings are not
unnatural, any more than those which Melbourne entertains
towards her. His manner to her is perfect, always respectful,
and never presuming upon the extraordinary distinction he
enjoys; hers to him is simple and natural, indicative of the
confidence she reposes in him, and of her lively taste for his
society, but not marked by any unbecoming familiarity.

<span class="pagehead">BROUGHAM&rsquo;S LETTER TO THE QUEEN.</span>
Interesting as his position is, and flattered, gratified, and
touched as he must be by the confiding devotion with which
she places herself in his hands, it is still marvellous that he
should be able to overcome the force of habit so completely
as to endure the life he leads. Month after month he remains
at the Castle, submitting to this daily routine: of all
men he appeared to be the last to be broken in to the trammels
of a Court, and never was such a revolution seen in
anybody&rsquo;s occupations and habits. Instead of indolently
sprawling in all the attitudes of luxurious ease, he is always
sitting bolt upright; his free and easy language interlarded
with &lsquo;damns&rsquo; is carefully guarded and regulated with the
strictest propriety, and he has exchanged the good talk of
Holland House for the trivial, laboured, and wearisome
inanities of the Royal circle.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_04_06" id="FN_04_06"></a><a href="#FNA_04_06"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
The Duke of Wellington says that Melbourne is quite right to go and
stay at the Castle as much he does, and that it is very fit he should instruct
the young Queen in the business of government, but he disapproves of his
being always at her side, even contrary to the rules of etiquette; for as a
Prime Minister has no precedence, he ought not to be placed in the post of
honour to the exclusion of those of higher rank than himself.</p></div>

<h3>December 19th, 1838</h3>

<p>Dined with Brougham the day before
yesterday, with whom I am on mighty intimate terms just
now. Sat next to Bellenden Ker (who drew up his Privy
Council Bill), who told me that Brougham said he was
writing sixteen hours a day, and about to bring out two
more volumes of his
Paley,<a name="FNA_04_07" id="FNA_04_07"></a><a href="#FN_04_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and I found the explanation of
his calculations at the Council Board in the fact that he was
working out some problems for the purpose of proving the
form of the structure of honeycombs. In the meantime he
has put forth a pamphlet in the shape of a letter to the
Queen, which he half acknowledges, and of which nobody
doubts that he is the author, as in fact nobody can who is
acquainted with the man or his writings. It makes a prodigious
noise in the world and is read with avidity, but,
though marked with all his cleverness, it is a discreditable production.
The tone of it is detestable, the object mischievous,
though by no means definite or clear. After stripping it of
all its invectives and ribaldry, there is no proposition which can
be extracted from it except that of giving universal suffrage,
for, although he does not say so, his argument cannot be
arrested short of such a consummation. It is a bitter, brilliant,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
wayward satire and philippic, and, as Johnson said of
Junius, &lsquo;if you extract from its wit the vivacity of impudence,
and withdraw from its efficacy the sympathetic favour of
plebeian malignity, if you leave it only its merit, I know not
what will be its praise.&rsquo; It is, however, marvellously characteristic
of the man, and illustrative of the state of his mind.
His present political conduct, if political it can be called, is
curious enough, for he is doing all he can to keep up his connexion
with the Radicals, and at the same time courting the
Tories, his only fixed idea being to worry the Government.
It is clear to me that he was jealous and displeased at the
notion of Durham&rsquo;s being put at the head of the Radical party,
and it was with evident glee that he told me on Monday how
grievously Durham had offended them by his reply to the
Westminster Association, which they very correctly took to
themselves. Brougham called on Leader on Sunday, where
he found Trelawny, and one or two more Radicals whose
names I have forgotten, when Leader expressed these sentiments
to him: he said there was no sort of necessity for
Durham&rsquo;s writing them such a letter, and that he had
evidently seized the opportunity of addressing <i>them</i> in that
shape, and of course there was an end of any possibility of a
connexion between him and them. This is very true, for the
fact is that Durham&mdash;who since his arrival has had time and
opportunity to find out in what a miserable position he has
placed himself, how feeble and inefficient the Radical party is
as a party, and how entirely he would destroy himself by becoming
their leader, and who moreover has been exceedingly
disgusted at the way in which he was taken up by Molesworth,
and provoked to death at being taken under his protection
at Devonport&mdash;desires earnestly to retrace his steps
and to disavow the alliance they have offered him, and which
they have so prematurely and ostentatiously proclaimed. He
now wants to put himself in a neutral and, if he can, a dignified
position. Yesterday he had an interview with Lord Wellesley,
whom he asked leave to call upon, and it is not at all unlikely
that it will end in his meeting Brougham at Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s
as their common friend. Brougham told me that their quarrel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">A LECTURE AT BATTERSEA.</span>
was at an end, and that it was now only a question which
should first speak to the other, and that Durham had said
he was not at all angry at the part he had taken in the
House of Lords, and owned he could not, consistently with
the conduct he had pursued with respect to Canada, have
acted differently. All this proves that he is ready enough
to make it up with Durham; in fact he will ally himself
with anybody who is likely to join him in attacking the
Government. What Brougham told me about the Radicals
was confirmed last night by Fonblanque, who said that
Durham&rsquo;s return had been positively serviceable to Government,
for if he had remained in Canada there were fourteen
or fifteen of that party who would most certainly have gone
into Opposition; but his return having led to the expectation
of his joining them, and that having been frustrated, there
was every probability of their doing what they had done before
and supporting the Government, however sulkily and
reluctantly, rather than throw open the door for the return
of the Tories. He said the slightest concession to them
from the Government would secure them, but I told him
none would be made, and he was aware of it.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_04_07" id="FN_04_07"></a><a href="#FNA_04_07"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
Paley&rsquo;s <i>Natural Theology</i>, illustrated by Lord Brougham, was published
soon afterwards.</p></div>

<p>I met Sheil at dinner yesterday at Poulett Thomson&rsquo;s,
who, to my surprise, is a candidate for the office of Judge
Advocate, and he expects, if Macaulay refuses it, to be appointed.
He begged of me to let him know as soon as Macaulay&rsquo;s
answer came, and he said, Normanby had strongly
urged it, and Melbourne was well disposed towards him.</p>

<h3>December 24th, 1838</h3>

<p>Went on Friday to Battersea to hear
Robert Eden deliver a lecture in the school-room&mdash;one of a
course he is delivering upon anatomy, or rather upon different
parts of the human body&mdash;and demonstrating the utility of
cleanliness, the danger of drunkenness, and mixing precept
with information for the benefit of as mixed an audience as
ever was assembled, but who seemed much interested and
very attentive. There were many of the gentry of Battersea,
male and female, the tradespeople, workmen, the boys of
the school, and a rough, ragged set of urchins, labourers on
the railroad&mdash;in all about 300 people. The lecture, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was upon the arm, was very fluently given; the lecturer is
not sufficiently master of his subject to make his explanations
very lucid and perfectly intelligible, but he conveys
good general notions, and introduces such a mixture of anecdote
and illustration as makes it sufficiently entertaining.
The undertaking is highly laudable; it is carried on with
great zeal and spirit, very considerable ability, and, as far as
it has gone, with complete success.</p>

<p>Dined yesterday at the Hollands&rsquo;: Normanby, Melbourne,
and Luttrell; pretty good talk. Melbourne, rather paradoxical,
asserted that &lsquo;men with quick feelings were always
the worst men; that he could not work out the proposition
metaphysically then, but that he should do.&rsquo; It was the
assertion of Brougham&rsquo;s having quick feelings which elicited
the saying, though certainly Brougham is not the <i>worst</i> of
men: far from it, nor did he mean to say so. Brougham
denies this pamphlet, and says he cannot be the author for
this reason: the pamphlet reasserts something about Melbourne
which he had asserted in one of his articles in the
&lsquo;Edinburgh Review.&rsquo; Melbourne, when he read that article,
wrote to Brougham, and told him that as he was sure he
did not wish to misrepresent him, he informed him that he
had never entertained the opinions nor given the vote there
ascribed to him. Brougham replied, admitting his error,
and promising to correct it, offering to do so at Melbourne&rsquo;s
option in another number of the &lsquo;Edinburgh Review,&rsquo; or <i>in
some other work</i> (I forget what). Melbourne wrote back, in
rather a jocular strain, that he thought it would be preferable
to have the correction in the same publication as the
statement, to which Brougham sent a good-humoured answer,
and there it ended. After this, he says that he could not by
possibility repeat the very same thing in another work that
he had already engaged to recall, and this is certainly strong.
At the same time there are things in it which no other man
could have written. Just before it came out he was preparing
something for the printer, for he came into my room
with a parcel of proof-sheets in his hand, which I fancied
were for me to frank to Macvey Napier, and I said so; when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ANECDOTES OF CURRAN.</span>
he replied, &lsquo;Oh no, they are going to the printer here.&rsquo; It
is after all not improbable that it was a joint production&mdash;his
and Roebuck&rsquo;s&mdash;Roebuck making the pudding, and
Brougham putting in the plums. Melbourne was talking
of Brougham&rsquo;s indignation and mortification at being deprived
of his pre-eminence in the House of Lords, and of a
letter he wrote in great bitterness of spirit, in which he said,
&lsquo;Do you mean to deprive me of my lead in the House of
Lords? Why don&rsquo;t you say as you did when you took the
Great Seal from me, &lsquo;God damn you, I tell you I can&rsquo;t give
you the Great Seal, and there&rsquo;s an end of it&rsquo;?&rsquo;</p>

<p>They spoke of Curran, his wit, and of his quarrel with
Ponsonby. When the Whigs came in in 1806, Ponsonby was made Irish
Chancellor.<a name="FNA_04_08" id="FNA_04_08"></a><a href="#FN_04_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
There had been some previous communication
with Curran, who had assented to Ponsonby&rsquo;s
being promoted to the highest place; but he expressed his
expectation that he should have the next, and he wanted to
be Attorney-General. Fox was very desirous of making him
Attorney, but Lord Grenville would not hear of it; he had
been so concerned with the rebels that it was thought impossible,
besides that it led directly to the Bench, for which
he was disqualified by temper and character. When Ponsonby
became Chancellor, Curran wrote to him to know if he was
to be Attorney; and Ponsonby sent him a pompous answer,
that &lsquo;his lips were sealed with the seals of office;&rsquo; which
affronted Curran. Eventually, they determined to buy out
the Master of the Rolls and put Curran in his place, and
they arranged with the Master that he should have 600&#8467;. a
year out of the place (a monstrous job). Accordingly Curran
was informed that he was to be the Master of the Rolls, but
<i>after</i> this notification (as he asserted), it was intimated to
him that he was to have this rider upon his place. He said,
he had been no party to such an agreement and he would
not pay it, nor did he. Ponsonby was highly indignant, said
Curran was a great rogue, and never would speak to him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
again; and he paid the 600&#8467;. a year out of his own pocket
as long as Curran lived. As a specimen of Curran&rsquo;s wit, one
day when Lord Moira had been making a speech in his usual
style full of sounding phrases and long words, Curran said,
&lsquo;Upon my word his lordship has been airing his vocabulary
in a very pretty style to-day.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_04_08" id="FN_04_08"></a><a href="#FNA_04_08"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
[Right Hon. George Ponsonby, who resigned the office in the following
year. Curran held the office of Master of the Rolls in Ireland from 1806 to
1814, when he retired on a pension of 3,000&#8467;. a year. He died in 1817.]</p></div>

<p>Lord Holland gave me an account of Fox&rsquo;s death, with all
the details of the operations (he was thrice tapped), and his
behaviour; and till then I was not entirely aware that Fox
was no believer in religion. Mrs. Fox was very anxious to
have prayers read, to which he consented, but paid little
attention to the ceremony, remaining quiescent merely, not
liking, as Lord Holland said, to refuse any wish of hers, nor
to pretend any sentiments he did not entertain.</p>

<h3>January 1st, 1839</h3>

<p>Another year gone, taking along with
it some particles of health, strength, and spirits, but it is to
be hoped making us something wiser and better, and giving
an increased power of passive resistance to bear up against
the accumulating ills or sorrows of life. But I will not&mdash;here
at least&mdash;plunge into a moralising strain. As to public
matters the year opens in no small gloom and uncertainty.
On the surface all is bright and smooth enough: the country
is powerful, peaceful, and prosperous, and all the elements
of wealth and power are increasing; but the mind of the
mass is disturbed and discontented, and there is a continual
fermentation going on, and separate and unconnected causes
of agitation and disquiet are in incessant operation, which
create great alarm, but which there seems to exist no power
of checking or subduing. The Government is in a wretched
state of weakness, utterly ignorant whether it can scramble
through the session, unable to assume a dignified attitude,
to investigate with calm deliberation the moral and political
condition of the country, and to act upon its convictions with
firmness and resolution, tottering and staggering between
one great party and one fierce faction, and just able to keep
on its legs because both are, for different reasons, willing to
wound but afraid to strike. It does not fulfil the purpose of
a Government, and brings the function itself into contempt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DISTURBED STATE OF THE COUNTRY.</span>
by accustoming men to look at it without any feeling of
attachment or respect. Wild notions of political grievances
and political rights have been widely disseminated among
the masses, and these are not engendered or fostered by the
prevalence of distress or that want of employment which not
unnaturally turns the thoughts of the idle and unoccupied
to the most desperate expedients for bettering their condition,
but they are the mere aspirings of a fierce democracy
who have been gradually but deeply impregnated with sentiments
of hatred and jealousy of the upper classes, and with
a determination to &lsquo;level&rsquo; all political distinctions and privileges,
and when this is accomplished to proceed to a more
equal distribution of property, to an agrarian experiment;
for it is idle to suppose that men of this stamp care anything
for abstract political theories, or have any definite object but
that of procuring the means of working less, and eating and
drinking more. The accounts of the Chartists (as they are
called), at and about Manchester, represent them to be collected
in vast bodies, associations of prodigious numbers,
meeting in all the public-houses, collecting arms universally,
and constantly practising by firing at a mark, openly threatening,
if their demands are not complied with, to enforce
them by violence. In the mean time there is no military
force in the country at all adequate to meet these menacing
demonstrations; the yeomanry have been reduced, and the
magistracy are worse than useless, without consideration,
resolution, or judgement. There is every reason to suppose
that they have got into a scrape with their arrest of Stephens,
the great Chartist orator, and that there is no case against him sufficient for a
conviction.<a name="FNA_04_09" id="FNA_04_09"></a><a href="#FN_04_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
The magistrates completely
lost their heads, and between their fears and their folly have
blundered and bothered their proceedings miserably, and so
as to afford an ultimate triumph to this mischievous fellow
and his followers.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_04_09" id="FN_04_09"></a><a href="#FNA_04_09"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
[One Stephens, formerly a Wesleyan preacher, and one of the most
violent agitators against the New Poor Law, was apprehended near Manchester
on December 27. He had used most incendiary language, but was
liberated on bail, and soon afterwards addressed a meeting of 5,000 people
at Ashton-under-Lyne. There seems to have been no case against him.]</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
A great field-day at the Council Office
yesterday to hear the Petition of the Serjeants against the
order of the late King opening the Court of Common Pleas
to all barristers. It was Brougham&rsquo;s
order.<a name="FNA_04_10" id="FNA_04_10"></a><a href="#FN_04_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
The Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, Master of the Rolls, three Chiefs, all
the Puisne Judges who are Privy Councillors, Lushington,
Wynford, and Brougham sat. Follett and Charles Austin
were counsel for the Serjeants, and the Attorney and
Solicitor-Generals ordered to attend, and seated at a table in
court. Follett spoke for four hours, and Austin for two, and
did not finish. A vast deal of historical research was
displayed, but it was not amusing nor particularly well done.
The Serjeants were present (the five petitioners), and Wilde
prompting Follett all the time. There seemed no difference
of opinion among the Judges, at least with those I talked to,
and the King&rsquo;s mandate (for such it was to the Chief Justice
of the Common Pleas, and under the sign manual, though
countersigned by nobody) will be declared waste paper, and
matters be replaced on their ancient footing till Parliament
may otherwise determine. Brougham appeared considerably
disconcerted, and though he tilted occasionally with the
counsel, he was on the whole quieter than usual and than I
expected he would have been. This order was one of those
things he blurted out in that &lsquo;sic volo sic jubeo&rsquo; style
which he had assumed, and without consideration, probably
without consultation with anybody, or he might easily have
avoided the commission of such a blunder.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_04_10" id="FN_04_10"></a><a href="#FNA_04_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
[The Serjeants-at-Law had enjoyed from time immemorial the exclusive
right of practising in the Court of Common Pleas. Upon the advice of
Lord Brougham, then Chancellor, King William IV. had issued a written
mandate to the court to open their bar to the whole profession. No doubt
the act was quite illegal and a nullity. The Serjeants now petitioned the
Queen in Council to set it aside. But the court was subsequently opened by
Act of Parliament.]</p></div>

<h3>January 18th, 1839</h3>

<p>Durham has come down from his high
horse, and has at last condescended to see Howick and Duncannon,
the latter through the mediation of John Ponsonby,

<span class="pagehead">THE MURDER OF LORD NORBURY.</span>
bitter in feeling and intention between him and the Government.
They are both anxious to avoid blows if possible, but
it is so difficult to avoid mutual inculpation and accusation,
although only professing exculpation, that it will be very
strange if the matter does (as many think it will) blow over
lightly. The personal question between Melbourne and
Durham about Turton appears the most difficult to settle;
but if there is a will there will be a way, and it is easy
enough to imagine the sort of civil, complimentary assurances
from one to the other, that though there had been a
great misunderstanding, it was no doubt unintentional, and
all that sort of palaver which is so familiar to old stagers and
parliamentary squabblers.</p>

<p>The murder of Lord
Norbury<a name="FNA_04_11" id="FNA_04_11"></a><a href="#FN_04_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
has made a great sensation
because the man is so conspicuous; for there seems no
reason for believing that he was murdered from any religious
or political motive, but that it was only another of the many
prædial enormities that are from time to time committed in
Ireland. At present this event only serves to exasperate angry
passions, to call forth loud blasts of the never silent trumpet
against Romanism and the Irish population, and it does not
lead men&rsquo;s minds <i>immediately</i> to a conviction of the necessity
of calmly investigating, and if possible applying a remedy to,
a social condition so full of crime and misery, and so revolting
to every feeling of humanity, as that of Ireland. But the
death of this poor man will conduce to this end, for it is
only through long processes of evil and after much suffering
that good is accomplished.</p>

<h3>January 24th, 1839</h3>

<p>Duncannon found Durham in a very complacent
mood, and he entered with him fully into the subject
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of Canada and their quarrels. With respect to Turton&rsquo;s
affairs, Durham denies he ever said, or authorised anybody
else to say, that the appointment had Melbourne&rsquo;s consent,
and he admits that Melbourne did put his veto upon Turton&rsquo;s
appointment to office, but says he considered this veto applicable
only to offices <i>under Government</i>, and that the place to
which he appointed him was not <i>under Government</i>, but one
at his own disposal, and for which he was wholly and solely
responsible. This is his excuse, and a very bad one it is.
It won&rsquo;t go down in the House of Lords, I imagine.</p>

<p>As the time draws near for the meeting of Parliament
the probability of ousting the Government grows fainter;
we hear no more of disunion and Radical hostility, and things
promise to continue pretty much as they have heretofore
been. The question of absorbing interest is now the repeal
or alteration of the Corn Laws, and the declaration of war
against them on the part of the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; has produced a
great effect, and is taken as conclusive evidence that they
cannot be maintained, from the rare sagacity with which this
journal watches the turn of public affairs; besides that, its
advocacy will be of the greatest use in advancing the cause
which it already had perceived was likely to prevail. The
rest of the Conservative press, the &lsquo;Morning Herald,&rsquo; &lsquo;Post,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Standard,&rsquo; support the Corn Laws, and the latter has
engaged in a single combat with the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; conducted
with a kind of chivalrous courtesy, owing to the concurrence
of their general politics, very unusual in newspaper warfare,
and with great ability on both sides.</p>

<h3>January 30th, 1839</h3>

<p>After four months or more from the time
when he threatened further disclosures, and when, it appeared
as if the whole matter had blown over, how or why nobody
could tell, Urquhart has published a fresh set of letters which
passed between himself and
Backhouse,<a name="FNA_04_13" id="FNA_04_13"></a><a href="#FN_04_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
for the purpose of
proving that the latter was a party to the publication of the
&lsquo;Portfolio.&rsquo; Backhouse, who was at Liverpool when these
came out, wrote to desire judgement might be suspended till
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE &lsquo;PORTFOLIO&rsquo;.</span>
certain notes omitted by Urquhart had been also published,
and to-day they appeared; but instead of making the case
better, they have made it rather worse. It is altogether a
dirty transaction, and mortifying to those who care about
the character of public men, and who have some feeling of
national pride and vanity in the super-eminence of English
statesmen for integrity and high-mindedness. It is not very
difficult to extract the truth from the mass of verbiage and
contradictory assertions in which it is involved, and it appears
that Urquhart, having got hold of the papers, communicated
them to Palmerston, offered to publish them, and was
encouraged by him to do so. Urquhart, who was appointed
secretary of embassy at Constantinople while this publication
was going on, took every opportunity of consulting the Foreign
Office, and of trying to make Palmerston and his under-secretaries
<i>participes criminis</i>, in order that they might share the
responsibility and stand committed with him. Against this
they fought, and while they took good care that Urquhart
should understand that they wished the publication of the
&lsquo;Portfolio&rsquo; to be continued, they kept shifting and shirking
in hopes of not committing themselves materially. It is
pretty clear that Backhouse really disliked the whole thing,
had no mind to meddle with the &lsquo;Portfolio,&rsquo; or mix himself
up with Urquhart, and it was only the official obligation that
was imposed upon him by Palmerston&rsquo;s wishes which induced
him very reluctantly to engage in the business even so far as
he did, and it is very painful to see his early struggles to keep
clear of it, and his present abortive attempts to wriggle out
of his concern with the publication. It is Palmerston on
whom the blame ought to rest, and on whom it will rest,
only nobody seems to take the least interest in the dispute,
and he brazens it out in a very unblushing manner. I am
more particularly struck with the meanness here exhibited,
from having just been reading Lord Chatham&rsquo;s correspondence,
in which his noble and lofty character, so abhorrent of
everything like trickery, shabbiness, and underhand dealing,
shines forth with peculiar lustre. It is animating and refreshing
to turn to the contemplation of this really great and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
noble mind, even more remarkable I think for dignity of sentiment
and purity of motive, than for eloquence and capacity.</p>

for Foreign Affairs. He filled this office from 1827 till 1842.]</p></div>

<p>Last Friday the Serjeants&rsquo; case came on
again before the Privy Council. The Attorney and Solicitor
made a sort of reply to Austin, but acknowledged that the
mandate was not binding on the Court of Common Pleas; in
fact, that it was illegal. Brougham was very angry, and kept
battling with counsel or with Wynford, Abinger, or others
of the Lords, though not violently. They were anxious
to get rid of the question if possible, and to avoid making
a report to the Queen. The conclusion (pretty nearly unanimous)
to which they came was, that the order was illegal,
but that it was neither expedient that matters should return
to their former, nor remain in their present state; and they
agreed to adjourn the consideration of the question. They
then separated with an understanding that a Bill should be
brought in directly to settle the dispute, and they don&rsquo;t
intend to meet again upon it till this Bill has been passed.
Thus they will avoid making any report at all.</p>

<p>Brougham and Lyndhurst came to a Patent case the day
before, both in high spirits. After it was over Lyndhurst
came into my room, when I said, &lsquo;You look in high force.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I am quite <i>passé</i>, entirely done up.&rsquo; Just
then Brougham came in, when I said to him, pointing to
Lyndhurst, &lsquo;He says he is quite <i>passé</i> and done up.&rsquo; &lsquo;Just
like me,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I am quite <i>passé</i> too.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;there
can be no use in two such poor worn-out creatures as you
two going to the House of Lords.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do you hear him?&rsquo;
cried out Brougham: &lsquo;A capital suggestion of the Clerk of
the Council: we won&rsquo;t go to the House of Lords at all; let
us go together to
<i>Hamble</i>.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_04_14" id="FNA_04_14"></a><a href="#FN_04_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
And then he seized Lyndhurst&rsquo;s
arm, and off they went together chuckling and laughing and
brimful of mischief.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_04_14" id="FN_04_14"></a><a href="#FNA_04_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a>
Hamble is the country seat of Sir Arthur Paget, who was present with
Brougham.</p></div>

<p>He came out the night of the Address with a very brilliant
speech, and with a fierce and bitter philippic against
O&rsquo;Connell for having insinuated that Lord Norbury had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RESIGNATION OF LORD GLENELG.</span>
been shot by his own son. Last night, O&rsquo;Connell retaliated
in the House of Commons, and denying that he had even
thought of, or insinuated any such thing, he hurled back
an invective still fiercer, bitterer, more insulting, and very
powerful too. Very little discussion grew out of the Queen&rsquo;s
Speech, all parties being agreed to defer the consideration
of great questions till brought regularly on. There was a
pretty strong demonstration in the House of Commons in
favour of the Corn Laws, so as to render it improbable that
anything will be done. The only thing which seems to
threaten the Government at present is, the hatred that has
sprung up between the English Radicals and the Irish, and
the animosity which prevails among the former against
O&rsquo;Connell. If this is carried to the length of inducing the
English Radicals to keep aloof on some important question,
Ministers may find themselves in a minority, and resign
thereon; and this is what the Tories are looking to as their
best chance.</p>

<h3>February 10th, Sunday, 1839</h3>

<p>On Friday, Lord Glenelg announced
in the House of Lords that he had
resigned,<a name="FNA_04_15" id="FNA_04_15"></a><a href="#FN_04_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
though it would have been more correct to have stated that he had
been turned out. He said very little, but that little conveyed
a sense of ill-usage and a mortified spirit; none of the
Ministers uttered a word. Many wonder that they ventured to
make any changes in such a rickety concern, and that, if
they were resolved to do so, they did not have everything
settled before Parliament met. However, the Cabinet appears
to have been unanimous in determining that Glenelg
could not remain Colonial Minister, and they gave him a
sort of hint some time ago, by offering him Sir John
Newport&rsquo;s place (for whom an arrangement was to be made),
which he refused; so on Tuesday last the blow was struck,
and they proposed to him to be Privy Seal, which he declined
in some dudgeon. It certainly was difficult so to gild
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the pill he was asked to swallow as to disguise its bitterness
and make it tolerably palatable, for in whatever polite
periphrasis it might be involved, the plain English of the
communication was, that he was incompetent to administer
Colonial affairs.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_04_15" id="FN_04_15"></a><a href="#FNA_04_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a>
[Lord Glenelg had held the office of Secretary of State for the Colonies
since the formation of Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s second Administration in 1835.
He was succeeded in the Colonial Office by the Marquis of Normanby, who
had filled up to this time the office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.]</p></div>

<p>By venturing upon these changes the Government evidently
think they can scramble on, and on the whole it is
probable that they may, though never did a Government hold
office by so frail and uncertain a tenure, and upon such
strange terms. A pretty correct analysis of the House of
Commons presents the following result: 267 Government
people, including the Irish tail; 66 Radicals, 5 doubtful, and
315 Conservatives; 4 vacant seats, and the Speaker. If,
therefore, at any time, one half the Radicals should stay
away (they need not vote against), when danger threatens
the Government, it would be at an end; and if they do not
do so, it is because most of them are still unconvinced that it
would be better and more conducive to the ultimate success
of their objects to let the Tories in, and not from any love
to the present Ministers, whom, on the contrary, they hate
a good deal and despise a little. The Irish band appear to
be dependable, but there is no knowing what might be the
consequence of a change, and the withdrawal of all the personal
influence which Normanby had obtained over them.
It has often happened that a coalition of very opposite parties
has turned a Government out; but never before, that I
remember, kept one in, and for such a length of time. The
Conservatives are completely united, ably led, and count
in their ranks the most powerful men in the House of
Commons; they are by far the most numerous of any of the
parties, one-third more than the Whigs (without the Irish),
nearly five times more than the Radicals, and within twenty
of all combined; and yet they are as effectually excluded as
they were just after the passing of the Reform Bill, for all
that appears to the contrary.</p>

<p>Lord Durham&rsquo;s enormously long
Report<a name="FNA_04_16" id="FNA_04_16"></a><a href="#FN_04_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>

<span class="pagehead">LORD DURHAM&rsquo;S REPORT.</span>
&lsquo;Times&rsquo; on Friday last, before being laid on the tables of
the two Houses, whereat he rose in his place and expressed
much surprise and displeasure, all of which was very ridiculous
and superfluous, for he had two thousand copies of it
printed, and distributed them to the right and left, to anybody
who came to see him, to Foreign Ministers and others, so

in the course of the next twenty years this Report changed the Colonial
policy of the Empire, and the principles laid down in it certainly converted
Canada from a revolted colony into one of the most loyal dependencies of
the British Crown. What would have been the result if the Ministers
of George III. had treated the complaints of the American colonies in 1774
with equal wisdom?]</p></div>

transaction. The whole report was written by Charles Buller, with the
exception of two paragraphs on Church or Crown lands, which were composed
by Gibbon Wakefield and Mr. Hanson. After the Report was presented to
the Colonial Office, the Government wished these last two paragraphs to be
modified. This Lord Durham was inclined to do. Wakefield resented this
and, in order to prevent any change, he got Hanson to send a copy of the
Report to the <i>Times</i>, where it appeared the next day. These particulars
have been communicated to me by a gentleman to whom Sir Richard
Hanson related them.]</p></div>

<h3>February 14th, 1839</h3>

<p>Lord Normanby was not acquainted with
the intention of dismissing Glenelg, nor was the thing settled
when he was here; on the contrary, he had made every preparation
for the Dublin season, and is put to serious inconvenience
by being thus suddenly sent for. Glenelg continues
to discharge the official duties, but he is deeply hurt at the
treatment he has experienced. It is the more remarkable
because at this moment his official correspondence with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Durham is published, in which he displays firmness, dignity,
and sense, so that the world can discern no good cause why
he should be so unceremoniously turned off. Melbourne
urged him to retire when his brother (Sir Robert Grant)
died; but Glenelg thought this was from kindness and
consideration, and was so touched, that he deemed it the more
incumbent on him to remain at his post.
Normanby will probably do much better, for though he has nothing like the
natural abilities of his predecessor, he has the knack of
succeeding in whatever he undertakes; he has application,
courage, and sense, and all this in spite of a frivolous
exterior. In Ireland, however obnoxious to the Orangemen, his
government has been successful, and I know of no error that
he has committed, except that of too often releasing prisoners
and commuting punishments without the sanction
and concurrence of the Judges. Nothing is so dangerous
and imprudent as to tamper with justice, and John Russell
himself has upon several occasions been rash and flippant in
this respect. It is not long ago that a man was tried and
found guilty, at the Sessions, of destroying a will with a
fraudulent intent. I forget what the punishment was, but a
petition for mercy was handed up to the Secretary of State&rsquo;s
office&mdash;got up by the clergyman of the parish, and signed by
many names. Without consulting the magistrates who had
convicted the man, he reduced the punishment to two months&rsquo;
imprisonment, and it turned out that the clergyman was
himself a man of indifferent character, who had been promoted
at the instance of Lord Fitzwilliam, and the rest of
the subscribers to the petition were ignorant people who had
signed it at his instigation: the object was unworthy of the
indulgence which was carelessly and improperly extended.
These things exasperate the magistracy, whom Lord John
is apt to regard with aversion and suspicion; but the Judges
are deeply offended when their sentences are arbitrarily set
aside, as they have sometimes been.</p>

<p>The Corn Law question, which appeared so formidable
before Parliament met, has lost much of its terrors; and an
error committed by one of its champions, Mr. Wood of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE CORN LAW QUESTION.</span>
Preston, greatly assisted to damage it. Peel turned against
him certain admissions which he made of the prosperity of
trade, with extraordinary dexterity and effect. The Anti-Corn-Lawites
were so enraged and mortified that they punished
their blundering advocate by dismissing him from his
post of President of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce;
and his constituents invited him to resign. This, and the
strong demonstration in favour of the existing system the
first night, the divided opinions and indifference of the
Government, and the diversion made by the Chartists, have
placed the Corn Laws in perfect security for this session at
least. It is curious to see the conduct of the &lsquo;Times&rsquo;: just
before Parliament met it thought the time was come when
something must be done, and it accordingly took up the
cudgels against the Corn Laws; but now that it finds the
time is not come, it has dropped the subject altogether, and
relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>There seems very little probability of any discussion about
Canadian affairs till Government introduces some legislative
measure, and the expected personalities and recriminations
will silently pass away. Brougham and Durham are reconciled
after a fashion; Ministers and Durham mutually desire
to sheathe their swords. The correspondence which has just
appeared at the tail of the Report exhibits a grand specimen
of arrogance and vanity on Durham&rsquo;s part, not unmixed with
talent, albeit his letters are intolerably prolix. Glenelg has,
however, much the best of the controversy as soon as they
begin to cross their weapons, and his despatch conveying
the Queen&rsquo;s disapprobation of his Proclamation is very dignified
and becomingly severe. It is impossible to conceive
anything more galling to a man so puffed up with pride and
vanity, and who fancied himself to be placed upon a pinnacle
far above the sphere of official obligation and responsibility.</p>

<p>It is curious to see the different measure that was dealt
out to Durham and to
Head,<a name="FNA_04_18" id="FNA_04_18"></a><a href="#FN_04_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
the latter an able, though not
always a prudent man, who really did good service in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
government, and extricated himself boldly and successfully
from a very difficult situation. He had dismissed a Judge
for certain reasons, part of which he explained to the Colonial
Office, and for the rest he told them that he must, in
the difficult position he was in, draw upon their confidence to
support and confirm his act. They said this was not enough,
and insisted on his restoring the Judge. Upon this he tendered
his resignation, which they instantly accepted; and
when he came home they took no notice of him whatever,
and at the same time they were flattering and lauding and
trying to cajole Durham, and begging and praying him to
stay, in the midst of his blundering acts and insolent language,
and while he was addressing the Government in the
most contumelious terms. Head has behaved very well about
the publication of his despatches; for when he asked Melbourne&rsquo;s
leave to publish, and the latter refused, he promised
that nothing should appear, and that he would discourage
any Parliamentary attempt to elicit them. Now that Durham&rsquo;s
Report has come forth, containing strictures on Head&rsquo;s
conduct, he assumes a right to publish, for his own vindication,
and he has asserted this in a pettish letter to Melbourne;
whereas, if he had again asked for permission on this express
ground, it would not have been refused. The motto of this
Government, however, seems to be,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">parcere superbis et debellare subjectos,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0;">and their besetting sins are pusillanimity, indifference, and
<i>insouciance</i>. On a discussion the other night about speaking
on petitions, when the Speaker laid down the practice, which
Lord John Russell supported with great earnestness, and
which was opposed on Radical grounds by the Radicals,
Stewart of the Treasury, and Vernon Smith, marched off and
would not vote; and, instead of being reprimanded, Vernon
Smith will probably be made Under Secretary of State.</p>

<p>I dined at Lady Blessington&rsquo;s yesterday,
to meet Durham and Brougham; but, after all, the latter did
not come, and the excuse he made was, that it was better
not; and as he was taking, or going to take (we shall see), a

moderate course about Canada, it would impair his efficacy
if the press were to trumpet forth, and comment on, his meeting
with Durham. There was that sort of strange <i>omnium
gatherum</i> party which is to be met with nowhere else, and
which for that reason alone is curious. We had Prince Louis
Napoleon and his
A.D.C.<a name="FNA_04_19" id="FNA_04_19"></a><a href="#FN_04_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
He is a short, thickish, vulgar-looking
man, without the slightest resemblance to his Imperial
uncle, or any intelligence in his countenance. Then
we had the ex-Governor of Canada, Captain Marriott, the
Count Alfred de Vigny (author of &lsquo;Cinq Mars&rsquo; &amp;c.), Sir
Edward Lytton Bulwer, and a proper sprinkling of ordinary
persons to mix up with these celebrities. In the evening,
Forster, sub-editor of the &lsquo;Examiner;&rsquo; Chorley, editor of the
&lsquo;Athenæum;&rsquo; Macready, and Charles Buller. Lady Blessington&rsquo;s
existence is a curiosity, and her house and society
have at least the merit of being singular, though the latter
is not so agreeable as from its composition it ought to be.
There is no end to the men of consequence and distinction
in the world who go there occasionally&mdash;Brougham, Lyndhurst,
Abinger, Canterbury, Durham, and many others; all
the <i>minor</i> poets, <i>literati</i>, and journalists, without exception,
together with some of the highest pretensions. Moore is a
sort of friend of hers; she <i>has been</i> very intimate with Byron,
and <i>is</i> with Walter Savage Landor. Her house is furnished
with a luxury and splendour not to be surpassed; her dinners
are frequent and good; and D&rsquo;Orsay does the honours with a
frankness and cordiality which are very successful; but all
this does not make society, in the real meaning of the term.
There is a vast deal of coming and going, and eating and
drinking, and a corresponding amount of noise, but little or
no conversation, discussion, easy quiet interchange of ideas
and opinions, no regular social foundation of men of intellectual
or literary calibre ensuring a perennial flow of conversation,
and which, if it existed, would derive strength and
assistance from the light superstructure of occasional visitors,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
with the much or the little they might individually contribute.
The reason of this is that the woman herself, who must
give the tone to her own society, and influence its character,
is ignorant, vulgar, and
commonplace.<a name="FNA_04_20" id="FNA_04_20"></a><a href="#FN_04_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Nothing can be
more dull and uninteresting than her conversation, which is
never enriched by a particle of knowledge, or enlivened by a
ray of genius or imagination. The fact of her existence as
an authoress is an enigma, poor as her pretensions are; for
while it is very difficult to write good books, it is not
easy to compose even bad ones, and volumes have come forth
under her name for which hundreds of pounds have been
paid, because (Heaven only can tell how) thousands are
found who will read them. Her &lsquo;Works&rsquo; have been published
in America, in one huge folio, where it seems they meet with
peculiar success; and this trash goes down, because it is
written by a Countess, in a country where rank is eschewed,
and equality is the universal passion. They have (or some
of them) been likewise translated into German; and if all
this is not proof of literary merit, or at least of success,
what is? It would be not uninteresting to trace this current
of success to its source, and to lay bare all the springs of the
machinery which sustains her artificial character as an
authoress. The details of course form the mystery of her
craft, but the general causes are apparent enough. First
and foremost, her magnificent house and luxurious dinners;
then the alliance offensive and defensive which she has
contrived (principally through the means of said house and
dinners) to establish with a host of authors, booksellers, and
publishers, and above all with journalists. The first lend
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">GORE HOUSE.</span>
her their assistance in composition, correction, or addition;
with the second she manages to establish an interest and an
interchange of services; and the last everlastingly puff her
performances. Her name is eternally before the public; she
produces those gorgeous inanities, called &lsquo;Books of Beauty,&rsquo;
and other trashy things of the same description, to get up
which all the fashion and beauty, the taste and talent, of
London are laid under contribution. The most distinguished
artists and the best engravers supply the portraits of the
prettiest women in London; and these are illustrated with
poetical effusions of the smallest possible merit, but exciting
interest and curiosity from the notoriety of their authors;
and so, by all this puffing and stuffing, and untiring industry,
and practising on the vanity of some, and the good-nature of
others, the end is attained; and though I never met with
any individual who had read any of her books, except the
&lsquo;Conversations with Byron,&rsquo; which are too good to be hers,
they are unquestionably a source of considerable profit, and
she takes her place confidently and complacently as one of
the literary celebrities of her day.</p>

[Lady Blessington had a good deal more talent and reading than Mr.
Greville gives her credit for. Several years of her agitated life were spent
in the country in complete retirement, where she had no resources to fall
back upon but a good library. She was well read in the best English
authors, and even in translations of the classics; but the talent to which she
owed her success in society was her incomparable tact and skill in drawing
out the best qualities of her guests. What Mr. Greville terms her vulgarity
might be more charitably described as her Irish cordiality and <i>bonhomie</i>. I
have no doubt that her &lsquo;Conversations with Lord Byron&rsquo; were entirely
written by herself. It is true that, writing, as she did, to make money,
many of her other books were exceedingly worthless.]</p></div>

<h3>London: February 24th, 1839</h3>

<p>Hitherto the proceedings
in Parliament have been sufficiently languid and uninteresting.
The debate on the Corn Laws, which was expected to
occupy two or three nights, went off in one, and a great
majority against hearing evidence, followed by no sort of
sensation, has set the question at rest for the present. Lord
Winchilsea brought on the Turton case in the House of
Lords, when Durham made a blustering, and Melbourne
a prudent, moderate, and satisfactory explanation. He had
remonstrated against the appointment, when Durham had
replied that his honour was concerned in it and he could not
cancel it; and Melbourne said, he did not think he should
be justified in hazarding the great objects of Durham&rsquo;s mission
for such an object as Turton&rsquo;s removal. Durham threatened,
if anything more was said on the subject, to bring
forward the cases of all those who had been guilty of a
similar offence, and had afterwards held office. He did not
say what he had to say well, for he might have exposed the
cant of all this hubbub, and have asked Winchilsea, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CHANGES AT THE COLONIAL OFFICE.</span>
talked of sense of duty and so forth, and that he should have
done the same by his dearest friend, whether he had thought
it necessary to make a similar stir when Sir George Murray
was appointed Secretary of State; and, besides this <i>argumentum
ad hominem</i>, he might have asked, whether in point
of fact it was an admitted principle that those who had committed
heavy offences against the laws of morality should be
therefore disqualified from serving in a civil capacity. However
the question is at an end, and has gone off smoothly
enough all things
considered.<a name="FNA_05_01" id="FNA_05_01"></a><a href="#FN_05_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

[Sir George Murray had run away with Lady Louisa Erskine, whom
he afterwards married. But Turton&rsquo;s breach of morality was of a more
serious character. Mr., or as he afterwards became Sir Thomas, Turton had
been guilty of an intrigue with his sister-in-law, which led to the dissolution
of his marriage. On this ground Lord Melbourne had objected to his going
out to Canada with Lord Durham in a public capacity; but Lord Durham,
with very bad taste, took him out in what he was pleased to call a private
capacity. The public, as this was a question of morals, were slow to accept
this distinction.]</p></div>

<p>After much difficulty about filling up Sir George Grey&rsquo;s
place at the
Colonies,<a name="FNA_05_02" id="FNA_05_02"></a><a href="#FN_05_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Labouchere has very handsomely
volunteered to take it, though lower in rank and pay, and
far more laborious than that which he before held. They
did not venture to ask him, but it was thrown out by Le
Marchant that he would be the most eligible successor to
Grey; when he said immediately, that if Government thought
he could be of use to them and to the public, and he was
satisfied the measures to be proposed would be such as he
could conscientiously support, he would take the office without
hesitation. They took him at his word, and he was
installed <i>instanter</i>; had he not taken it, Ben Stanley would
have gone there. These changes have so much disconcerted
Stephen that he has proposed to resign, and it is still a question
whether he does or not; but they will hardly let him go,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
for his knowledge and powers of wielding the business cannot
be dispensed with, particularly by two men perfectly new
and inexperienced in Colonial affairs.</p>

[Sir George Grey, who had been Under Secretary for the Colonies,
was made Judge Advocate and a Privy Councillor on the 1st of March,
1839. Mr. Labouchere, who had been Vice-President of the Board of Trade
and Master of the Mint since 1835, very handsomely consented to take the
inferior office at the Colonies. Mr. Labouchere, however, returned to the
Board of Trade as President on the 29th of August, 1839. Mr. Stephen was
the permanent Under Secretary for the Colonies.]</p></div>

<h3>March 2nd, 1839</h3>

<p>The whole town has been engrossed for some
days with a scandalous story at Court, and although of course
great exaggerations and falsehoods are grafted upon the real
case, and it is not easy to ascertain what and how much is
true, enough is known and indubitable, to show that it is a
very discreditable transaction. It appears that Lady Flora
Hastings, the Duchess of Kent&rsquo;s lady, has been accused of
being with child. It was at first whispered about, and at last
swelled into a report, and finally into a charge. With whom
it originated is not clear; but the Queen appears to have been
apprised of the rumour, and so far to have entered into it as
to sanction an intimation to the lady that she must not
appear at Court till she could clear herself of the imputation.
Medical examination was either demanded by her or submitted
to, and the result was satisfactory to the virtue of
the accused damsel. Then naturally exploded the just indignation
of insulted honour. Her brother, Lord Hastings,
came up to town, saw Melbourne, who is said to have endeavoured
to smother the affair, and to have tried to persuade
Lord Hastings to do so; but he was not at all so inclined,
and if he had been, it was too late, as all the world had begun
to talk of it, and he demanded and obtained an audience of
the Queen. I abstain from noticing the various reports of
what this or that person did or said, for the truth of which
I could not vouch; but it is certain that the Court is plunged
in shame and mortification at the exposure, that the palace
is full of bickerings and heart-burnings, while the whole
proceeding is looked upon by society at large as to the last
degree disgusting and disgraceful. It is really an exemplification
of the saying, that &lsquo;les Rois et les Valets&rsquo; are made
of the refuse clay of creation, for though such things sometimes
happen in the servants&rsquo; hall, and housekeepers charge
still-room and kitchen-maids with frailty, they are unprecedented
and unheard of in good society, and among people
in high or even in respectable stations. It is inconceivable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BULWER&rsquo;S &lsquo;RICHELIEU&rsquo;.</span>
how Melbourne can have permitted this disgraceful and
mischievous scandal, which cannot fail to lower the character
of the Court in the eyes of the world. There may be objections
to Melbourne&rsquo;s extraordinary domiciliation in the
palace; but the compensation ought to be found in his good
sense and experience preventing the possibility of such
transactions and <i>tracasseries</i> as
these.<a name="FNA_05_03" id="FNA_05_03"></a><a href="#FN_05_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h3>March 8th, 1839</h3>

<p>I went last night to the first representation
of Bulwer&rsquo;s play &lsquo;Richelieu:&rsquo; a fine play, admirably got up,
and very well acted by Macready, except the last scene, the
conception of which was altogether bad. He turned Richelieu
into an exaggerated Sixtus V., who completely lost
sight of his dignity, and swaggered about the stage, taunting
his foes, and hugging his friends with an exultation quite
unbecoming and out of character. With this exception it
was a fine performance; the success was unbounded, and the
audience transported. After Macready had been called on,
they found out Bulwer, who was in a small private box next
the one I was in with Lady Blessington and D&rsquo;Orsay, and
were vociferous for his appearance to receive their applause.
After a long delay, he bowed two or three times, and instantly
retreated. Directly after he came into our box, looking very
serious and rather agitated; while Lady Blessington burst
into floods of tears at his success, which was certainly very
brilliant.</p>

<p>The Government have offered Canada to Lord
Clarendon,<a name="FNA_05_04" id="FNA_05_04"></a><a href="#FN_05_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
who is coming home to give his answer in
person. They are resolved to make <i>maison nette</i> at the
Colonial Office, and want to oust Stephen; but the publication
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of Sir Francis Head&rsquo;s extraordinary
book,<a name="FNA_05_05" id="FNA_05_05"></a><a href="#FN_05_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;in
which he is denounced as a Republican, and as the author of all the
mischievous policy by which our Colonial possessions have
been endangered, and his dismissal is loudly demanded&mdash;makes
it impossible for Stephen to retire, or for Government
to invite him to do so. Stephen cannot vindicate himself,
except by divulging official secrets which he considers it
would be a grievous breach of trust and duty to do; but he
declares to me that he has abundant means of vindication in
his hands if he chose to avail himself of them. The world
believes that each Secretary of State (Glenelg particularly) has
been a mere puppet in his office, and that it is Stephen
who has moved all the strings; but the fact is, there have
been three parties&mdash;Stephen, Glenelg, and the Cabinet; and
though the first may have exercised a great influence over
the second, it has often happened, that both have been overruled
by the last, and neither Head nor anybody else can do
more than conjecture what has really been the secret history
of our Colonial policy. Glenelg, however, was evidently
feeble, and his faculties seem to have been entirely benumbed
ever since the flagellations he got from Brougham in the
beginning of last session. His terror of Brougham is so
intense that he would submit to any humiliation rather than
again expose his back to such a merciless
scourge.<a name="FNA_05_06" id="FNA_05_06"></a><a href="#FN_05_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<h3>March 25th, 1839</h3>

<p>Laid up with the gout for these ten days,
in which time the only occurrences of moment have been the
great (and final) debate on the Corn Laws, and the hostile
vote in the House of
Lords,<a name="FNA_05_07" id="FNA_05_07"></a><a href="#FN_05_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
followed by John Russell&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD NORMANBY&rsquo;S IRISH ADMINISTRATION.</span>
declaration in the House of Commons, and appeal to that
House from the vote of the Lords. The Corn debate was
extremely long and dull, and the House more than usually
clamorous and impotent. The only speech was Peel&rsquo;s, said
to have been exceedingly able; the division was better for
the Cornites, and worse for their antagonists, than had been
expected; the decision received with great indifference, and
the question put on the shelf for some time.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_05_07" id="FN_05_07"></a><a href="#FNA_05_07"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
[On the 18th of March Mr. Charles Villiers&rsquo; motion for a Committee to
take into consideration the duties on corn was defeated in the House of
Commons by 342 to 195 votes. I know not why Mr. Greville styles it the
&lsquo;final&rsquo; debate, which it certainly was not.</p>
<p>On the 21st of March Lord Roden carried in the House of Lords, by
a majority of five, a motion for a Committee to inquire into the state of
Ireland since 1835. This motion was directed against Lord Normanby&rsquo;s
Administration. Shortly afterwards this motion was met by a resolution of
Lord John Russell&rsquo;s in the House of Commons approving the Irish policy of
the Government, which was carried by 318 to 296.]</p></div>

<p>The other affair is much more interesting, because more
personal, and involving the existence of the Government.
There seems to have been an abundance of angry feeling and
a great lack of discretion and judgement on all sides: first
of all in the House of Lords thus lightly and somewhat
loosely pressing this vote, and going the length of appointing
a Committee; and why the Duke of Wellington consented to
it is difficult to see, unless it be that his mind is a little enfeebled,
and his strong sense no longer exercises the same
sway. They hardly seem to have intended what they did, for
they made no whip up, and Lord Wicklow went away without
voting. As it was, Government had better have rested
upon their old declaration, that as long as they were supported
by the House of Commons they should disregard the
opposition of the House of Lords; and so in fact they would
have done, if the next day Normanby had not flared up so
violently and insisted on resignation or reparation. At the
Cabinet there was a long discussion whether they should
resign or not, and the Speaker, Ellice, and others of their
friends, were strongly for their taking this opportunity of
retiring with all their strength, and upon a question which
would have rendered it next to impossible for their successors
to go on if they took their places. The result, however,
was the declaration of John Russell, and their determination
to try their strength in the House of Commons. If
the Radicals support them they will get their usual majority
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of from fifteen to twenty; but it does not appear that they will
gain much by that, for the Lords will go on with their Committee
and put Normanby on his trial without caring for the
vote of the Commons.</p>

<p>With regard to the merits of the case, Normanby&rsquo;s
Government was no doubt on the whole carried on in a very
good spirit; but as it was in an Irish spirit, it was of course
obnoxious to the old dominant party. There is not the
slightest suspicion that in his exercise of the prerogative of
mercy he was ever influenced by any improper motives or
showed any partiality; though Lord Wellesley said, that
&lsquo;he dramatised royalty, and made mercy appear blind instead
of justice.&rsquo; But the system is of very questionable propriety,
and on some occasions he probably was rather too free with
it, and went a little further than in strict prudence he ought
to have done. Generally speaking, however, on this point
as well as on the other grounds on which he has been
attacked, he has defended himself with great vigour and success.
The night after the debate, he gave Brougham a heavy
fall, and exposed his glaring inconsistency and falseness.
Brougham is said to have appeared more annoyed and crestfallen
than ever he did before. He certainly made a very
poor and inefficient reply.</p>

<p>Nothing would be more unfortunate than a change of
Government as the result of this blow aimed by the House
of Lords, and under the auspices of Roden, the leader of the
Orangemen. Ireland is the great strength of the present
Government as it is the weak point of the Tories; and if they
went out, and Peel came in upon Ireland, and the principle
on which he should govern that country, he would never
keep his place, and nobody could tell what troubles might
not ensue. It is Peel&rsquo;s interest that Irish questions should
assume such a shape, and make such a progress, before
he returns to office, as should render their final adjustment
inevitable. If things were left alone, and time and the hour
permitted us to run through the present rough days, it would
be impossible to prevent great changes taking place before
long. The country is beset with difficulties on all sides, if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WEAKNESS OF THE GOVERNMENT.</span>
not with danger; besides the ever rankling thorn of Ireland,
there are the Chartists and the Anti-Corn Law agitators, to
say nothing of minor reformers in England, and the whole
of our Colonial Empire in a most unsettled, precarious, and
difficult state, requiring the utmost wisdom and firmness
in dealing with Colonial interests, and our relations with
America demanding firmness, temper, and sagacity.
But, while the country has thus urgent need of all the ability and
experience which can be enlisted in her service, from the
curious position of parties in the House of Commons, and
the mode in which power is distributed, we have at once a
Government miserably weak, unable to exercise a will of its
own, bolstered up by the interested and uncertain support of
men more inimical than friendly to them; while the most
distinguished statesmen and the men who are admitted to
be the fittest to govern, are effectually excluded from office.
While we have a Cabinet in which there is not one man who
inspires confidence, and in which, with the exception perhaps
of John Russell (who is broken in health and spirits), there is
not one deserving to be called a statesman,&mdash;to this Cabinet
is committed the awful task of solving the many difficult
questions of domestic, colonial, and foreign policy which
surround and press upon us; while the Duke of Wellington
and Peel are compelled &lsquo;to stand like ciphers in the great
account.&rsquo; The great characteristic of the present time is
indifference: nobody appears to care for anything; nobody
cares for the Queen, her popularity has sunk to zero, and
loyalty is a dead letter; nobody cares for the Government, or
for any man or set of men. If there was such a thing as a
strong public opinion alive to national interests, intent upon
national objects, and deeply sensible to the necessity of calling
to the national councils all the wisdom and experience that
the crisis demands, its voice would be heard, the two parties
would cease to hold each other at bay, there would be either
a great change or a fusion in some reasonable spirit of compromise,
and we should see a Government with some energy,
independence and power, and this is what we want. But
Melbourne seems to hold office for no other purpose but that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of dining at Buckingham House, and he is content to rub on
from day to day, letting all things take their chance. Palmerston,
the most enigmatical of Ministers, who is detested
by the <i>Corps Diplomatique</i>, abhorred in his own office, unpopular
in the House of Commons, liked by nobody, abused by
everybody, still reigns in his little kingdom of the Foreign
Office, and is impervious to any sense of shame from the
obloquy that has been cast upon him, and apparently not
troubling himself about the affairs of the Government generally,
which he leaves to others to defend and uphold as they
best may. The only man besides John Russell in the Cabinet
who stands high in estimation is Morpeth, and it is remarkable
that in this Government the young ones or subordinates
are its chief strength. Morpeth, Labouchere, George Grey,
and Francis Baring are better men than almost any in the
Cabinet, which is certainly the most second-rate one this
country ever saw.</p>

<h3>March 28th, 1839</h3>

<p>It is amusing to see the nervous consciousness
on both the Tory and the Whig side of blunders having
been committed by each in this demonstration of the Lords
and retort of the Government. The Chancellor of the Exchequer
came into my room yesterday, and told me that Lord
Spencer had expressed his strenuous approbation of the course
they had taken, just the right medium, neither too much nor
too little; and this sanction he seemed to think very valuable,
though in fact worth nothing, for Lord Spencer lives among
oxen, and not among men. On the other hand, I met
Graham, and said to him, &lsquo;A pretty scrape you would have
been in if Government had resigned upon this vote.&rsquo; He
shrugged up his shoulders and said, &lsquo;I own I am better
pleased as it is.&rsquo; No great party should do things by halves
and doubtingly: if the leaders thought the case was so grave
as to call for the interference of the House, and that they
were justified in taking this matter into their own hands,
they ought to have brought down all their forces, and have
given their vote all the authority it would derive from an
imposing majority. No maxim is more clearly understood
than that any party having generally a large majority, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DEFECTION OF THE MORNING CHRONICLE.</span>
only carrying some particular question by a very small one,
suffers something like a defeat, because it implies that they
have not the concurrence on such question of many of their
usual supporters. This was, therefore, a false move one way
or the other. The Government, however, have no doubt of
carrying their point by as large a majority as they ever
can have.</p>

<p>They are in a great rage, and in no small dismay at the
same time, at the conduct of the &lsquo;Morning Chronicle,&rsquo; which
has turned half against them in a most extraordinary manner,
that is, it is urging the Radicals to seize this opportunity of
compelling the Government to go their lengths, and to make
such compliance the condition of their support. Government
are so indignant that they want to break off with the
&lsquo;Chronicle&rsquo; altogether; but then they will be left in the
awkward predicament of having no morning paper whatever
in their service. What nettles them the more is, that they
made the &lsquo;Chronicle&rsquo; what it is, and raised it by their exertions
from the lowest ebb to its present very good circulation.
Just before Peel&rsquo;s hundred days it was for sale, and had then
fallen to about a thousand a day. Easthope was persuaded
by Ellice to buy it, which he did for 15,000&#8467;. or 20,000&#8467;. The
Whigs set to work, and Hobhouse, Normanby, Poulett Thomson,
Le Marchant, and several others, wrote day after day a
succession of good articles which soon renovated the paper and
set it on its legs. The circulation increased daily till it got
up to three thousand, and now it has reached six thousand.
Easthope makes a clear 10,000&#8467;. a year by the speculation;
but now, seeing (or thinking he sees) greater advantages to
be got by floating down the Radical stream than by assisting
in the defence of this Government, he forgets past favours and
connexion, and is ready to abandon them to their fate. It
is rather an ominous sign and marks strongly their falling
estimation. They think it is Durham who has got hold of
Easthope, and persuades him to take this course. He declares
he is so beset with applications, advice, and threats, that he
has no alternative, and must take the line he does, or ruin
the sale of his paper.</p>

expired last night soon after twelve, after a confinement of two or three
months from the time he returned to England. His end
was enviably tranquil, and he bore his protracted sufferings
(more from oppression and annoyance than acute pain) with
astonishing fortitude and composure. Nothing ruffled his
temper or disturbed his serenity. His faculties were unclouded,
his memory retentive, his perceptions clear to the
last; no murmur of impatience ever escaped him, no querulous
word, no ebullition of anger or peevishness; he was
uniformly patient, mild, indulgent, deeply sensible of kindness
and attention, exacting nothing, considerate of others
and apparently regardless of self, overflowing with affection
and kindness of manner and language to all around him,
and exerting all his moral and intellectual energies with a
spirit and resolution that never flagged till within a few
hours of his dissolution, when nature gave way and he sank
into a tranquil unconsciousness in which life gently ebbed
away. Whatever may have been the error of his life, he
closed the scene with a philosophical dignity not unworthy
of a sage, and with a serenity and sweetness of disposition
of which Christianity itself could afford no more shining or
delightful example. In him I have lost (half lost before)
the last and greatest of the friends of my youth, and I am
left a more solitary and a sadder man.</p>

<h3>London, April 6th, 1839</h3>

<p>I saw X. at Newmarket, and had a
long conversation with him, in which he gave me an account
of the state of affairs. The Government is at its last gasp;
the result of the debate next week may possibly prolong its
existence, as a cordial does that of a dying man, but it
cannot go on. They are disunited, dissatisfied, and disgusted
in the Cabinet&mdash;Lord John himself deeply so&mdash;considerably
alarmed at the state of affairs, resolutely bent
upon making no further concessions to Radicalism, and no
sacrifices for mere party purposes. There is a violent faction
in the Cabinet and in the Government, who are indignant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD JOHN RUSSELL&rsquo;S FINALITY.</span>
with him for his <i>finality</i> speech last year, to which they
ascribe the ruin of their cause, and Duncannon at the time,
or soon after, abused him openly and loudly for it. This
reached Lord John&rsquo;s ears, who complained of such conduct,
and the more because he had summoned a special Cabinet
for the purpose of announcing that it was his intention to
make this declaration, therefore they were all apprised of it,
whereas Duncannon had asserted that he did it without the
knowledge of his colleagues. It turned out in the course of
the explanation that Duncannon had been laid up at the
time, and was not present at this Cabinet, but he could
hardly have been ignorant of such an important circumstance,
and this shows the <i>animus</i> there was among some of
them. The principal object of the more radically-inclined
was to let Ballot be an open question, and to this Melbourne
had been persuaded to consent, though no doubt quite contrary
to his own wishes and opinions. But Melbourne has
no strong convictions or opinions founded on political principles
deeply engraven on his mind; he is easy, <i>insouciant</i>,
persuadable, averse to disputes, and preferring to sacrifice
his own convictions to the pertinacity and violence of others,
rather than manfully and consistently defend and maintain
them; still he looks up to John Russell and defers to him
more than to any of his colleagues, both on account of his
respect for his character and the station he holds as leader of
the House of Commons; and when any struggle occurs, and
he must side with one or the other party, he goes with Lord
John, and accordingly Ballot was not made an open question.</p>

<p>What Lord John says is this: That when the Reform
Bill was introduced, the extent and sweeping character of
the measure were hateful and alarming to many members of
the Cabinet and supporters of the Government; that the
ground on which he urged the adoption of the measure was
the expediency of leaving nothing for future agitation, and
of giving the country a measure so ample and satisfactory
that it might and ought to be final. To this argument
many who dreaded its consequences ended by yielding,
though reluctantly, and he considers himself, therefore,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
bound in honour to resist any further changes, and to take
his stand where we now are. Besides this he now (as I
gather) is seriously alarmed at the state of the country, and
deeply impressed with the necessity of opposing all the
Radical measures and propositions, which he considers parts
of a great system, and a comprehensive scheme of a revolutionary
character. Then he is disgusted and mortified at
the treatment he has personally experienced both in and out
of the House of Commons, and at the clamour and abuse of
which he has been the object on account of the firm determination
he has evinced to go no further; and this
clamour has not been confined to the regular avowed Radicals
or the organs of their opinions, but there are old self-styled
Whigs&mdash;his uncle, Lord William, for example&mdash;and
others, who are groaning over his obstinacy as they deem
it, and attributing to it the ruin of their party; all this
superadded to his broken
spirits<a name="FNA_05_09" id="FNA_05_09"></a><a href="#FN_05_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
makes him heartily sick
of his position; and, seeing the unpopularity and weakness
of the Government, denuded of all sympathy and
support, and left to be buffeted by the Tories on one side
and the Radicals on the other, he is aware, and not sorry to
be aware, that the last act is at hand. Of this approaching
catastrophe probably all the others are as well aware as himself,
but there are some among them who earnestly desire
that it should be so brought about as to make it next to impossible
for those who may succeed them to carry on the
Government. This, however, is not the object of Lord
John Russell, who, on the contrary, desires that the next
Government may be so formed and so conducted as to
enable him to support it, and to bring with him such
strength in its aid as may place it beyond the reach of
danger. Whether they get a majority or not on the 15th,
he knows that they cannot go on much longer. The Queen
will do whatever Melbourne advises her, and he will advise
her to send for the Duke of Wellington, who, in his turn,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD JOHN&rsquo;S FRIENDLINESS TO PEEL.</span>
will desire her to send for Peel. Whether or no any
attempt would be made towards a coalition, or a wide
comprehension, on the formation of the Government, nothing
would induce Lord John to take office, but he would be
desirous of supporting Peel&rsquo;s Government, if he could with
honour, and if the circumstances attending the change
should render it possible for him as well as for others disposed
to follow his course, to do so. He thinks that it is of
great consequence that there should be no dissolution, which
would throw the country into a ferment, lead to violent
manifestations and declarations, and to many people being
obliged to pledge themselves to measures of a dangerous
tendency. He wishes, therefore, to place Peel in such a
situation as shall exonerate him from the necessity of a
dissolution, by giving him a fair general though independent
support; but the power to do this depends much upon the
temper that is displayed, and upon the mode in which the
change is effected; for if the Tories cannot be restrained
from the exhibition of an insulting and triumphant demeanour,
the exasperation and desire of revenge in the discomfited
party will be too great and general to admit of his
aiding the new Government with an imposing force, and he
is therefore solicitous that prudence and moderation should
govern the Conservative councils. I asked X. whether he
thought that there were many others likely to take this view
and to follow Lord John&rsquo;s example and advice, and he said
that there were.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_05_09" id="FN_05_09"></a><a href="#FNA_05_09"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
[Adelaide, daughter of Thomas Lister, Esquire, and widow of the
second Lord Ribblesdale, was the first wife of Lord John Russell: she died
on the 1st November 1838, to the great grief of the Minister.]</p></div>

<p>All this, which is a brief abstract of our two conversations,
appeared to me of so much importance, and, above all,
that it is so desirable that the sentiments of the Whig leader
should be made known to the future Minister, that I asked
X. whether there would be any objection to my making
known as much as it was desirable to impart of our conversation
without committing anybody, and carefully abstaining
from giving what I might say the air of a communication
between parties in any shape or way. He said that
it certainly might be very useful that there should be some
such knowledge of these sentiments conveyed to the proper
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
quarter, but he did not think the time was yet come, and
that for the present I had better say nothing; to which
I replied that, as it might have an important effect upon
their deliberations which would be held previously to the
debate on the 15th, and upon the conduct of Peel and
his party on that occasion, I thought that the sooner the
communication took place the better, as there could be no
doubt that the temper displayed and the conduct pursued
by the different parties on that occasion would have a very
material effect upon all future arrangements, and upon the
condition, prospects, and necessities of the new administration.
I told X. that there was nothing I had such a horror
of as repeating things from one party to another, of retailing
political gossip, and of the appearance of worming myself into
the confidence of individuals of one side, and then betraying
it to those of another; that I would not therefore make the
slightest use of what he had told me without his entire
permission, and whatever I might say, I should faithfully
report to him. He, who knows me, was quite satisfied; but
others might not be. Then I have the greatest doubt to
whom I should speak. The only individuals I can think of
are the Duke, Fitzgerald, Graham, Wharncliffe, or Peel
himself. Peel himself would be the most direct, but he is
so cold, dry, and unsatisfactory, I know not how he would
take it, and he would very likely suspect me of some design,
some <i>arrière pensée</i>, some purpose of founding on this service
a title to his intimacy, or his patronage and assistance&mdash;in
short, some selfish, personal object. Whereas I hope and
believe that I am not actuated by any puerile vanity in this
matter, or the ambition of acting a part, however humble
and subordinate, but that I have no object but to render my
personal position instrumental to a great and good purpose.</p>

<h3>April 7th, 1839</h3>

<p>I sent for Clarendon, and consulted him
what I should do. He advised me to speak to Peel at once,
but first to ascertain whether John Russell certainly remained
in the same mind, because Ben Stanley reports to
the Cabinet that they will have so certain a majority that
their drooping spirits have been rather raised, and it will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION TO GRAHAM.</span>
never do for me to run the risk of deceiving Peel in any way.
I shall do nothing for the present, but turn it in my mind.
There is a moral or religious precept of oriental origin which
is applicable to politics as well as to morals and religion,
and which should, I think, be ever present to the mind:
&lsquo;When you are in doubt whether an action is good or bad,
abstain from it.&rsquo; I believe this is the safest and wisest
maxim with reference to sayings and doings: if you have
serious doubts whether it is advisable to do a particular
thing, or to say a particular thing, neither do, nor say; do
nothing, say nothing. Of course, if you must do or say
something, and the only choice is <i>what</i>, it is another thing.
I believe, when the mind is disturbed and is oscillating with
doubts of this kind, it is that vanity is whispering at one
ear and prudence at the other; but then prudence almost
always takes the deaf ear, and so vanity persuades.</p>

<h3>April 10th, 1839</h3>

<p>I wrote to X. on Saturday last, and said
that what I heard here of the confidence of Government
about their majority made me hesitate about saying anything
for fear Lord John should not be in the same mind. He
replied that he had no reason to believe he had changed
his mind, but that it might be better to say nothing for the
present. I had therefore resolved to say nothing, but on
Monday John Russell announced the terms of his
motion,<a name="FNA_05_10" id="FNA_05_10"></a><a href="#FN_05_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and Peel gave notice that on Friday he would give out his
amendment; therefore, if anything was to be done (as they
were thus coming to close quarters), no time was to be lost;
and accordingly, after much reflexion, I resolved to speak to
Graham, with whom old intimacy enabled me to converse
more freely than I could with Peel, whose coldness and
reserve, and the doubt how he would take my communication,
would certainly have embarrassed me. I called on
Graham yesterday, and had a conversation of two hours
with him. He began by saying that he could hold no communication
with me upon any political subject without
telling me that he should feel bound to impart everything to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Peel, and I replied that such was my intention. I then told
him, without mentioning names, or giving any authority, the
reason I had for speaking to him, and the conviction in my
own mind that there would be found (in the event of a
change of Government) a disposition on the part of John
Russell and others of the moderate Whigs to support Peel.
I told him that I thought it of such vital importance that
such a disposition should be fostered, and not checked or
suppressed by any violence in the conduct or language of his
party, such as might render it impossible for them to give
that support hereafter; that I had resolved to make known
to him, for his consideration and that of Peel, this my conviction;
at the same time, he must fully understand, I had
no <i>authority</i> for saying so, that I might be mistaken, and he
must take it for just what he judged it to be worth. I went
more at length into the subject, conveying to him much of
the information which had been imparted to me.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_05_10" id="FN_05_10"></a><a href="#FNA_05_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
[This was the motion approving the Irish policy of the Government,
above referred to.]</p></div>

<p>He replied that he was fully aware of the great importance
of this communication, and did not doubt that I had
very solid grounds for what I said; but at the same time he
thought the motion of which John Russell had given notice
was in itself a measure of such a violent character that it
was inconsistent with the moderation which I ascribed to
him, and he feared that, in the event of a change, he might
be persuaded to put himself at the head of the Whigs and
Radicals, and acquiesce for party purposes in those movement
measures to which he was certainly not personally inclined;
that as for himself, and Stanley also, they had old
feelings of regard, and friendship for Lord John, which would
always influence them; and that he had recently had a sort
of reconciliation with him (the circumstance of which he
detailed), after an alienation on account of his attack upon
Lord John in his speech at Glasgow; but that Peel had no
such amicable feelings towards him, and thought he had got
him at a great disadvantage on the present occasion; that
their amendment would be moderate in terms; but they
intended to be very strong in debate, and it was a good deal
to ask of them to emasculate their speeches for the prospective
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">NEGOTIATION WITH GRAHAM AND PEEL.</span>
but uncertain advantage of Lord John&rsquo;s future support.
&lsquo;You say,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;that you are convinced, on what
you deem good and certain ground, that John Russell is
disposed to resist the movement, and, in order to do so, to
support Peel, if he comes in; and you ask us to place such
confidence in this impression of yours, as to shape our conduct
in conformity with it. You ask us to adopt a tone so
moderate as to give no offence to John Russell, a lower tone
than would be naturally expected from us by our friends,
who will, and can, know nothing of our reasons for foregoing
the advantage which seems to be in our power, and for
treating our opponents with such extraordinary and unaccountable
lenity and forbearance. This is asking a great
deal.&rsquo; I owned that it was; but I urged that the paramount
importance of winning over the Whig leader, and a part of
the Whig party, to a decided opposition to the movement,
and the prospect it held out of separating the Whigs from
the Radicals, fully justified the sacrifice of any such advantage
as that to which he alluded. He said that, &lsquo;supposing
such were the views and feelings of John Russell himself, he
doubted whether the great Whig families would follow him.
He thought the Dukes of Sutherland, Devonshire, Bedford,
and others, would throw their influence into the opposite
scale, and that the majority of the Whigs would follow
Morpeth, who, he believed, was prepared to go any lengths.&rsquo;
I replied, that this might be so; that I could only speak of
what I knew; that it had occurred to me to enquire whether
he was likely to be followed by many others, and that to the
question I had thus put, the answer had been &lsquo;yes;&rsquo; but
that I could not pretend to say I knew of any certain instances
of support to be expected, though my own belief was,
that they would not be wanting. After a long conversation,
in which we discussed the state and aspect of affairs in all
their bearings, he ended by saying, that what I had said to
him had made a great impression upon him, and that he
should consider what it would be most advisable to do. He
thanked me for the confidence I had reposed in him, and
appreciated my motives; he should communicate with Peel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
about it, but whether he should mention what I had said to
him as the impression of his own mind only, or whether he
should tell him upon what authority it rested (upon mine),
he should hereafter determine. I told him I had rather
avoid, but had no objection, if necessary, to have my name
brought forward, and, above all things, he must understand
and convey to Peel that I had <i>no authority</i> for what I had
said, that nobody must be in the slightest degree <i>committed,</i>
that my impressions might be mistaken and erroneous, and
the event might not correspond with them; but that, such as
they were, I had frankly communicated them to him in hopes
that the communication might have a salutary effect.</p>

<h3>April 13th, 1839</h3>

<p>On Thursday morning I saw Graham again.
He had spoken to Peel, and told him exactly what I intended
him to say, neither more nor less, giving it as given to him
<i>by a friend of his own</i>. Peel was not disposed to attach much
weight to the communication, and finding how lightly he
regarded it, he thought it necessary to inform him that it
came from me. The mention of my name (he said) did make
a considerable impression on Peel, though much less than
the matter had made on Stanley and himself; the former
eagerly grasping at the prospect it held out, and believing
implicitly in Lord John&rsquo;s disposition. Still Peel was shaken,
but at the same time he was excessively annoyed and <i>put
out</i> by it. This (which appeared extraordinary enough)
Graham accounted for in this way: that Peel had arranged
the whole course of his conduct and the tenour of his speech
in his own mind; he thought he had got Lord John at a
great disadvantage, and that the debate would afford him the
opportunity of a signal triumph; and the notion of being
obliged to forego this advantage and triumph, and the perplexity
into which he was thrown between doubt whether it
really was worth while, and fear of sacrificing a great and
permanent, to an accidental and ephemeral interest, threw
him into an uncertainty and embarrassment which disturbed
his equanimity. It is at all events fortunate that I did not
go to him myself, for I should have been met with a cold
austerity of manner which would have disconcerted me, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">COLD RECEPTION BY PEEL.</span>
I should have most certainly quitted him mortified and disappointed,
and without having effected any good.</p>

<p>Peel said to Graham that he should express no opinion,
make no promise, and would not say whether or how his
conduct would be affected by what he had heard. I replied
on this, that I did not desire or expect that he should, and
that my object was attained when he was made aware of
what I knew. I repeated that I had no authority, and he
must attach as much or as little importance to my opinion
as he thought it was worth. Graham said that, notwithstanding
his annoyance, he was in fact fully sensible of the
importance of the circumstances, and that he would look
with the greatest solicitude for what fell from John Russell
himself, considering that his speech would afford the test of
the correctness of my impressions, and that if the tenour of
that speech confirmed them, their speeches would be of a
corresponding character; that he might defend the policy
of the Government, and the administration of Ireland, as
strenuously as he pleased; but if he attacked the House of
Lords, or truckled to the Radicals, they must give a vent to
the indignant feelings that such conduct would inevitably
excite, and it would be impossible for them to satisfy their
followers by a mere milk-and-water debate, and by abstaining
from the use of their weapons when the other side were
unscrupulous in the use of theirs. I said I did not desire
that they should go into action with their swords in their
scabbards, while their enemies were to have theirs drawn;
that I admitted that this opening speech might be considered
a fair test, and that all I desired was, that if they <i>could</i> be
moderate they <i>would</i>, and always keep in sight the motives
for moderation. This, he assured me, I might depend upon.
Peel thinks <i>the motion</i> itself so violent, that it announces
violent dispositions; and he says it is moving the Appropriation
Clause over
again.<a name="FNA_05_11" id="FNA_05_11"></a><a href="#FN_05_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
The only individual to whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
all this has been communicated, besides Peel and Stanley, is
Arbuthnot, for the purpose of being conveyed to the Duke of
Wellington, but without any mention of my name.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_05_11" id="FN_05_11"></a><a href="#FNA_05_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>
[The terms of Lord John&rsquo;s resolution were these: &lsquo;That it is the
opinion of this House that it is expedient to persevere in those principles
which have guided the Executive Government of Ireland of late years, and
which have tended to the effectual administration of the law and the general
improvement of that part of the Kingdom.&rsquo; It is difficult to perceive any
violence in this language.]</p></div>

<p>Yesterday I had a long letter from X., to whom I wrote
an account of my interview with Graham, approving of what
I had done, and I wrote Graham a note saying as much (but
not mentioning X.&rsquo;s name, as I have never done). This he
considered of such importance that he showed it to Peel, and
he told me that Peel was greatly more sensible of the value
of the information, and more disposed to shape his conduct
accordingly. He said to Stanley, &lsquo;Why, I must go down to
the House of Commons with two speeches.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>April 21st, 1839</h3>

<p>At Newmarket all last week, and having
heard from nobody, could judge of the debate only from
reading the report. Lord John&rsquo;s speech was admirable, and
so skilful, that it satisfied his friends, his foes, and did not
dissatisfy the Radicals. Peel was flat and laboured, and did
not satisfy his own people, all of which may be attributed to
the necessity he was under of making speech number two.
The rest of the debate was very moderate, but the Government
had an excellent case, nothing being proved against
them; and the facts on which the Opposition relied being
all explained or rebutted satisfactorily. The division was
better, too, than they expected, and some accidents told in
their favour; for example, a stupid Tory (Goddard), who was
besieged with letters and notes to be present at the division,
turned sulky and restive in consequence, and voted with the
Government, much to the delight of the Ministerial, and the
rage of the Opposition whippers-in, though to the amusement
of both. But the moderation, which it was my object to
enforce, was manifested on both sides, and nothing fell from
John Russell offensive in a constitutional or even in a party
sense, and the Opposition leader abstained from attacking
him, with a forbearance which, if calculated, was very consistently
maintained. Satisfactorily, however, as the whole
thing appears to have terminated for the Government, they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MODERATION OF THE DEBATE.</span>
do not consider it to have given them any permanent
strength, or the prospect of a longer tenure of office; for the
Radicals, while one and all supported them on this Irish
vote, were not sparing of menace and invective, and plainly
indicated that, unless concessions were speedily made for
them, the Government should lose their support; and consequently,
there are many who are hoping and expecting,
and many more who are desiring, that concessions should be
made, and by these means that the Government concern
should be again bolstered up. Some of the Cabinet, more
of the subordinates and hangers-on, and many of what are
called the old Whigs, are earnestly pressing this, and they
are very angry and very sorrowful because John Russell is
inflexible on this point. He has to sustain the assaults, not
only of the violent of his party, and of Ellice and the out-of-door
advisers, monitors and critics, but of his own family,
even of his father, who, after announcing that he had given
up politics and quitted the stage, has been dragged forward
and induced to try his parental rhetoric upon the conservative
immobility of his son. To the letter which the Duke
wrote him, Lord John merely replied that &lsquo;he would shortly
see his opinions in print;&rsquo; and to Ellice&rsquo;s warm remonstrances
and entreaties he only dryly said, &lsquo;I have made up my mind.&rsquo;
His nephew, Lord
Russell,<a name="FNA_05_12" id="FNA_05_12"></a><a href="#FN_05_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
who, from some extraordinary
crotchet, has thought fit to embrace republican opinions,
and is an ultra-movement man, but restrained in the manifestation
of his opinions from personal deference to his
father and his uncle, with whom he lives on excellent terms&mdash;said
the other day to Lord Tavistock, &lsquo;Lord John has undertaken
a great task; he is endeavouring to arrest the progress
of the movement, and if he succeeds he will be a very great
man. He may succeed, and if he does it will be a great
achievement.&rsquo; This Lord Tavistock told Lord John, who
replied that &lsquo;he was convinced of the danger which threatened
the country from the movement, and of the necessity of opposing
its progress; that he considered this duty paramount to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
all other considerations. He did not desire the dissolution of
the Government to which he belonged; on the contrary, he
wished to remain in office; but nevertheless he considered
the promotion of party objects and the retention of office
subordinate to the higher and more imperative duty of
opposing principles fraught with danger to the State, and
to that end he would devote his best energies.&rsquo; (It is
impossible to give the exact words, and these are not <i>the
words</i>, but it is the exact sense of what he said.)</p>

<h3>April 22nd, 1839</h3>

<p>The moderate Radicals are now very
anxious to come to some amicable understanding with the
Government, and, if possible, to prop up the concern. They
are very angry with their more violent compeers (Grote,
Leader, &amp;c.), and Fonblanque told me last night that they
would take the slightest concessions, the least thing that
would satisfy their constituencies, but that <i>something</i> they
must have, and that something he appeared to think they
should get. I asked him what was the <i>minimum</i> of concession
that would do, and he said the rate-paying clauses,
which would be merely working out the original principle,
the demolition of the boroughs under 300 electors, and Ballot
an open question. I told him that I was persuaded these
things were impossible; that Lord John Russell never would
consent to begin again the work of disfranchisement, nor to
make Ballot an open question; that he <i>is alarmed</i>, and
determined to stop. Clarendon had told me much the same
thing in the morning on the authority of his brother
Charles,<a name="FNA_05_13" id="FNA_05_13"></a><a href="#FN_05_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
who is a very leading man, and much looked to
among them, probably (besides that he really is very clever)
on account of that aristocratic origin and connexion which
he himself affects to despise, and to consider prejudicial to
him. Of course this anxiety on the part of the moderate
Radicals to come to terms will increase the eagerness of the
violent Whigs to strike a bargain; but Lord John will continue,
I believe, to forbid the banns. These things would
only be wedges, no sooner conceded than fresh demands
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE RADICALS AND THE WHIGS.</span>
would be raised upon them; besides, they never could, without
abandoning every principle of independence and losing
all sense of honour, yield to contumely, menace and the
most insulting language, what they have so long and pertinaciously
refused to milder appeals and all the means of
persuasion and remonstrance. The great body of the Conservatives
certainly, and I believe the whole country, will
make no distinction between different sections and shades of
Radicals, but consider every concession made to one as made
to all, and the consequence would be fresh taunts against
the Government for being made of such <i>squeezable</i> materials,
without its prolonging their Ministerial existence for a very
long period. It would, however, prevent the split between
the great masses of Whigs and Radicals, and secure a
formidable Opposition, together with union at the election
whenever it took place. Fonblanque told me that if the
Government was broken up by the desertion of the Radicals,
the latter would lose all their seats at the next election, for
they are scarcely anywhere strong enough to come in without
the assistance of the Whigs.</p>

<h3>April 24th, 1839</h3>

<p>Graham called yesterday to ask how my
friends were satisfied with their speeches, and to say that
they had been entirely so with Lord John&rsquo;s, and, in consequence,
able to express themselves with the reserve and
moderation which they had displayed. I told him it had all
done very well, plenty of moderation on both sides, and I
hoped good had been done. He said that Peel was still
suspicious about Lord John, whom he did not know personally
as he and Stanley did, and therefore could not
bring himself to put the same confidence in the sincerity
and integrity of his intentions. Confound the fellow, what
a cold feeler and cautious stepper he is! Strange that the
two leaders should make themselves so personally obnoxious
as they do by their manners and behaviour. Nevertheless
John Russell, though frigid and forbidding to strangers, is a
more amiable man with his friends; but the other has no
friends. I have more than once remonstrated on the impolicy
of Lord John&rsquo;s carelessness in his treatment of people,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and I had an instance of the mischief it does the other day.
Sheil told me at Brooks&rsquo;s that one of his Irish members
(Macnamara) was close to Lord John in the House, and
looked at him in vain for a sign of recognition. Lord John
stared, but made no sign; the affronted Milesian frothed up
instantly and said, &lsquo;Confound him, I&rsquo;ll vote against him.&rsquo;
They pacified him so far as his vote was concerned; but
Sheil naturally enough observed that it was a very unwise
thing to neglect people&rsquo;s little vanities and self-love so
wantonly and carelessly.</p>

<h3>April 30th, 1839</h3>

<p>Le Marchant told me yesterday that there
is a great change come over the spirit of the Reformers, and
undoubted evidence of a reaction. Joe Parkes, who recently
went on a tour through the country, and who, before he
went, in an interview with Ben Stanley, Gore, Anson, and
Le Marchant, was full of menace and big words about the
necessity of concession and the strength of the movement,
returned quite crestfallen, and has since confessed that he
found matters no longer in the same state, and a general
lukewarmness, in many cases an aversion to the movement.
Le Marchant has since been in communication with the
editors of the &lsquo;Sun&rsquo; and of the &lsquo;Daily Advertiser,&rsquo; both of
whom are engaging themselves in the service of Government,
and they have owned the same thing, that in the
districts in which the Chartists have appeared, their excesses
have produced a regular reaction and aversion to reform,
and elsewhere that reasonable people, without giving up
their principles, are satisfied that the moment is not come
for enforcing them, and are for leaving things alone. This
information, which appears worthy of credit, is very important
as regards the condition of the country, and if it is
acted upon by the Radicals in the House of Commons, may
still prolong the existence of the Government. Nobody can
well make out what Peel is at with his Jamaica amendment,
and though he says it is no party question, they are whipping
up in all directions to fight another battle.</p>

<p>The Duke of Newcastle has been dismissed
from the Lieutenancy of Nottinghamshire, as he ought to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DISMISSAL OF THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE.</span>
have been long ago. I met the Duke of Wellington at the
Ancient Concert, and asked him the reason, which he told
me in these words: &lsquo;Oh, there never was such a fool as he
is; the Government have done quite right, quite right, they
could not do otherwise.&rsquo; There was a correspondence
between him and the Chancellor about the appointment
of some magistrates: he recommended two gentlemen of
Derbyshire as magistrates of Nottinghamshire, and the
Chancellor told him he meant to appoint likewise two
others, one of whom was a Mr. Paget. The Duke replied
that he objected to Mr. Paget&mdash;first, because he was a man
of violent political opinions; and, secondly, because he was
a Dissenter. The Chancellor told him that Mr. Paget was
not a man of violent political opinions, and as to his being
a Dissenter, he considered that no objection, and that he
should therefore appoint him, together with the gentlemen
recommended by the Duke. The Duke wrote a most violent
answer, in which he said that his lordship had the power of
making this appointment if he chose to do so, and if he did,
he would have the satisfaction of knowing that he had done
very wrong, and he informed him that for the future he
should hold no confidential communication with him. The
Chancellor (the Duke of Wellington said) behaved in the
most gentlemanlike manner possible; nobody could behave
better. He sent to the Duke of Newcastle to say that he
must be aware, on reflexion, that he ought not to have
written such a letter, and he would therefore return it to
him, that he might, if he pleased, put it in the fire, and let
it be considered as not having been written at all. The
Duke replied that he had no objection to withdraw the
letter, <i>provided the Chancellor would cancel the appointment</i>.
Upon this, Lord John Russell wrote him word that &lsquo;Her
Majesty had no further occasion for his services as Lord
Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the county of Notts.&rsquo;
Yesterday morning the Duke of Newcastle went to Apsley
House, and said to the Duke of Wellington, &lsquo;You have
heard what has happened to me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; said the Duke,
&lsquo;I have heard nothing;&rsquo; and then the Duke of Newcastle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
gave him Lord John&rsquo;s letter to read. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but
there is a correspondence alluded to in this letter: where is
it?&rsquo; and then the Duke of Newcastle put into his hands the
correspondence with the Chancellor. As soon as the Duke
of Wellington had read it, he said, &lsquo;They could not do
otherwise; no Government could be carried on if such a
letter as this was submitted to.&rsquo; &lsquo;What shall I do?&rsquo; said the
Duke of Newcastle. &lsquo;Do?&rsquo; said the Duke: &lsquo;Do nothing.&rsquo;</p>

came out late on Friday evening, and three editions
were sold of it yesterday, and not a copy to be had. It is
very sound and temperate, will be a bitter pill to the
Radicals, and a source of vexation to his own people, but
will be hailed with exceeding satisfaction by all moderate
and really conservative men of whatever party. I saw
Graham yesterday morning, who owned that it had fully
answered all the expectations held out by me as to his
intentions and opinions.</p>

<p>The Jamaica Bill is about to produce a fresh crisis much
more difficult to get over than the last, and it puzzles me to
make out why Peel has chosen this ground on which to fight
a great and possibly a decisive
battle.<a name="FNA_05_15" id="FNA_05_15"></a><a href="#FN_05_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The Government, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">JAMAICA BILL.</span>
is true, have placed themselves by their measure in a false
position, because on their own reasoning their Bill does not
go far enough, and ought to have extended to the dissolution
instead of merely to the suspension of the Assembly, and
this was what the Colonial Office authorities recommended.
In a paper drawn up by Henry Taylor for the use of the
Cabinet, he set forth the incompatibility of the present
assembly with the new order of things, and exposed the
absurdity of a system falsely called representative; but they
did not venture to take so decided a step, and preferred a
half measure, which dissatisfies everybody, and which would
only defer the difficulty and embarrassment of a final settlement.
Still, having adopted this course, and determined to
deal with the Colony upon their own responsibility, I cannot
understand why Peel did not let them alone. There was
no popularity to be gained by taking this course; the country
does not care a straw for the constitution of Jamaica, the
anti-slavery feeling is all against the Assembly, and nobody
will believe that the Tories are animated by any high constitutional
scruples, or that they care about the question
except as one on which they can fight a battle. Peel
(Graham said) &lsquo;offered his plan in the sincere hope and
expectation that Government would accept it.&rsquo; Perhaps it
may be of the two preferable (though there is a serious
objection to it, in the lapse of time that would occur before
anything could be done), but the Government cannot come
down to Parliament with proposals for administering colonial
affairs in such a manner as they deem necessary and expedient,
and then at the bidding or suggestion of Sir Robert
Peel, adopt another plan of which, while he would be the
author, they must be the responsible executors. This would
not be governing, but handing over the Government to their
opponents. If Peel really was of opinion that this Bill was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
so unwise and inexpedient, that no considerations of a general
nature would justify him in consenting to it, or in not
opposing it, he was right to take the course he has done;
but not otherwise; for, as the Bill can only be carried, if
at all, by a small majority, it will go out to Jamaica with
diminished moral effect, and it was above all things desirable
that an Act so penal should be invested with all the authority
derivable from unanimity, or at least the concurrence of
an overwhelming majority. Now this is the consideration
of which the importance is admitted by both sides, and
it might have afforded Peel a good reason for giving way to
the Government, when he found they would not give way to
him. As it is, the Bill will go up to the Lords with the
usual majority, and the Lords will have to determine upon a
course full of important consequences. If they throw it out,
it seems to me that Ministers must resign, and no question
could be devised on which they could resign so advantageously
for their own interests as a party, none of which
would be less popular for their opponents, and which would
afford so good an occasion and such great facilities for
keeping together the Whigs and Radicals in a firm and
consentient opposition. The great object of Peel&rsquo;s policy
appears to have been to avoid returning to office until he
could do so in such strength as to be able to carry on
the Government with security, and it was my belief that
he never would return until he had some sort of guarantee
that this would be in his power. The great desideratum,
therefore, of all moderate men, was the dissolution of the
connexion between the Whigs and Radicals, and the ultimate
establishment of a Government upon the anti-movement
principle, and it was with reference to this paramount object
that I was so desirous of getting Peel&rsquo;s course shaped so as
to harmonise with John Russell&rsquo;s sentiments and conduct.
But if the Government resign upon this Jamaica question,
all this fine plan will be defeated. Great are the effects of
party rancour, and if the battle is fought on merely party
grounds, and the Lords are to be the instruments of achieving
the victory, the Whigs and Radicals will forget their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE CABINET RESIGNS.</span>
present bickerings and mutual topics of grievance and discontent,
and bury their animosities in a common determination
to resist and defeat their political antagonists. With
the majority against him unbroken in the Commons, but
without an option as to taking or refusing office if tendered
to him (because he would have himself compelled the Government
to resign), Peel must dissolve, and he would encounter
the election with the whole antagonist force united against
him, aided by the anti-slavery feeling together with all the
jealousy that could be excited against the predominance of
the House of Lords. Suppose the general election were to
give him a very large majority, even then the great opportunity
of separating the Whigs and Radicals would have
been lost, and there is every reason to believe that when
there is to be a fair fight for power, the Whigs will not be
nice as to the banners that are displayed in their front, and
that the majority of them will agree to many things of which
they do not approve, rather than mar combinations instrumental
to the overthrow of the Tory party, and their own
restoration to power.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_05_15" id="FN_05_15"></a><a href="#FNA_05_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a>
[On the 6th May, Lord John Russell proposed in the House of
Commons to suspend the Constitution of Jamaica for five years, because
the Assembly of that Island had refused to adopt the Prisons Act passed by
the Imperial Legislature. A division was taken on the question, that &lsquo;the
Speaker do now leave the Chair,&rsquo; and the Government had a majority of five
in a House of 583. Upon this grave consequences ensued. Mr. Henry
Taylor argued, in the paper he submitted to the Cabinet on this question,
that in the existing state of society in the West Indies, the forms of Constitutional
Government could only lead to the oppression of the blacks by the
whites, or of the whites by the blacks, and that the inveterate feelings by
which the Colonists were divided would lead to measures of oppression, and
in the end would break out into acts of violence. He therefore proposed
the abolition of the Assemblies and the substitution of Legislatures based on
the model of those existing in the Crown Colonies. This scheme was approved
by Lord Melbourne and by Lord Howick, but it was feebly supported
by Lord Glenelg and rejected by the Cabinet. Lord John Russell then
brought forward the half-measure on which the division was taken. In the
opinion of Mr. Henry Taylor this decision led to twenty-six years of misgovernment
in the Colonies, and at length to the outbreak of the negroes in
Jamaica in October 1865, which was only suppressed by the energy of
Governor Eyre. Government by the Crown, which the Colonial Department
had vainly advocated in 1839, was established in 1866, with excellent
results to the Colony.]</p></div>

<h3>May 10th, 1839</h3>

<p>I left town on Monday, having in the morning
seen Le Marchant, who knows better than anybody the numbers
and details of divisions; and he told me that they should
have a majority of twenty: little, therefore, was I prepared
to hear on Tuesday morning that they had been left with
only a majority of five. It was not till they were in the House
of Commons that they were aware of the defections, and of
the probability of a close division, if not of a defeat. About
ten of the Radicals voted against them, and ten or a dozen
stayed away; six of the Tories voted with Government, but
the balance was quite enough to reduce the old majority to
an equality. On Tuesday the Cabinet met, and resolved to
resign. The Queen had not been prepared for this catastrophe
and was completely upset by it. Her agitation and
grief were very great. In her interview with Lord John
Russell she was all the time dissolved in tears; and she
dined in her own room, and never appeared on the Tuesday
evening. Melbourne advised her to send for the Duke, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
on Wednesday morning she sent for him. By this time
she had regained her calmness and self-possession. She told
him that she was very sorry for what had occurred, and for
having to part with her Ministers, particularly Lord Melbourne,
for whom she felt the warmest regard, and who had
acted an almost parental part towards her. The Duke was
excessively pleased with her behaviour and with her frankness.
He told her that his age and his deafness incapacitated
him from serving her as efficiently as he could desire,
and that the leader of the House of Commons ought to be
her Prime Minister, and he advised her to send for Peel.
She said, &lsquo;Will you desire him to come to me?&rsquo; He told
her that he would do anything; but, he thought, under the
circumstances, it would be better that she should write to him
herself. She said she would, but begged him to go and
announce to Peel that he might expect her letter. This the
Duke did, and when Peel received it, he went to the Palace
(in full dress according to etiquette), and received her commands
to form a Government. She received him (though
she dislikes him) extremely well, and he was perfectly
satisfied.</p>

<p>While the Tories were rejoicing in their victory, the
Whigs, greatly exasperated, were already beginning to meditate
the organisation of a strong Opposition, and providing
the means of carrying on an effectual war against the new
Government. They do not choose to look upon their expulsion
as attributable to the defection of their allies, but as
the work of the Tories upon a mere party question, and that
a very unjustifiable one, and treated in a very unjustifiable
manner. I met Ellice and Labouchere in the street, and
found them full of menace and sinister prediction, and to
my assertion that all would go well and <i>easily</i>, they shook
their heads, and insisted that the conduct of their opponents
entitled them to no forbearance, and that finding none, their
difficulties and embarrassments would be very great; and I
found in other quarters that there is a disposition to rally
and marshal the party, and commence offensive warfare; but
others of the Whigs entertained no such views, and looked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE BEDCHAMBER DIFFICULTY.</span>
upon the game as quite lost for the present; and in point of
fact, nothing is settled, fixed, combined, or arranged as yet;
and there has not been time to ascertain the disposition or
intentions of the leaders.</p>

<p>While, however, there was yesterday this uncertainty and
agitation in the Whig camp, and the Tories were waiting in
perfect security for the tranquil arrangement of the new
Government, a storm suddenly arose, which threatens to
scatter to the winds the new combinations, and the ultimate
effects of which it is impossible for anybody to foresee. The
Queen insisted upon keeping the ladies of her household, and
Peel objected, but without shaking her determination. He
begged her to see the Duke of Wellington, and she agreed
to see the Duke and him together. He had, however, before
this gone to the Palace with Lord
Ashley,<a name="FNA_05_16" id="FNA_05_16"></a><a href="#FN_05_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
whom he had taken with him, fancying that because he had been in the
habit of seeing a great deal of the Queen, he might have
some influence with her&mdash;a notion altogether preposterous,
and exhibiting the deficiency of Peel in worldly dexterity and
tact, and in knowledge of character. Ashley made no impression
on the Queen. When the Duke and Peel saw her, and
endeavoured to persuade her to yield this point, they found
her firm and immoveable, and not only resolved not to give
way, but prepared with answers to all they said, and arguments
in support of her determination. They told her that
she must consider her <i>Ladies</i> in the same light as <i>Lords</i>: she
said, &lsquo;No, I have Lords besides, and these I give up to you.&rsquo;
And when they still pressed her, she said, &lsquo;Now suppose the
case had been reversed, that you had been in office when I
had come to the Throne, and that Lord Melbourne would not
have required this sacrifice of me.&rsquo; Finding that she would
not give way, Peel informed her that under these circumstances
he must consult his friends; and a meeting took
place at his house yesterday afternoon.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_05_16" id="FN_05_16"></a><a href="#FNA_05_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a>
[Lord Ashley, then a member of the House of Commons, afterwards
seventh Earl of Shaftesbury: though a follower of Sir Robert Peel, he was
married to Lady Emily Cowper, Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s niece, and this circumstance
probably induced Peel to invoke his assistance.]</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
In the meantime the old Ministers were apprised of the
difficulty that had occurred, and Lord John Russell, who
knew that there was a meeting at Peel&rsquo;s to consider what
was to be done, entreated Melbourne, if the thing was broken
off upon this difficulty, not to give any advice, but to call
the Cabinet and have a general consultation. At nine in
the evening he was summoned to a Cabinet at Melbourne&rsquo;s
house, and from this he inferred that negotiations with Peel
had closed. The ministers were collected from all quarters:
(Hobhouse from dinner at Wilton&rsquo;s, Morpeth from the
opera), and Melbourne laid before them a letter from the
Queen,<a name="FNA_05_17" id="FNA_05_17"></a><a href="#FN_05_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
written in a bitter spirit, and in a strain such as
Elizabeth might have used. She said, &lsquo;Do not fear that I
was not calm and composed. They wanted to deprive me of
my Ladies, and I suppose they would deprive me next of my
dressers and my housemaids; they wished to treat me like a
girl, but I will show them that I am Queen of England!&rsquo;
They consulted, and a suggestion was thrown out that Lady
Normanby (and some other I think) should resign. This
was overruled, as was a proposition of John Russell&rsquo;s, that
the Queen should require from Peel a precise statement of
the extent of his demands. The end was, that a letter was
composed for her, in which she simply declined to place the
Ladies of her household at Peel&rsquo;s discretion. This was sent
yesterday morning; when Peel wrote an answer resigning
his commission into Her Majesty&rsquo;s hands; but recapitulating
everything that had passed. When the difficulty first arose,
Peel asked her to see the Duke; she acquiesced; he fetched
him, and the Duke was with her alone. The Duke it was
who argued <i>the principle</i> with her&mdash;Peel had touched upon
its application.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_05_17" id="FN_05_17"></a><a href="#FNA_05_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a>
Melbourne, it appears, from his own statement in the House of Lords,
was sent for at six o&rsquo;clock on Thursday.</p></div>

<p>It was speedily known all over the town that the whole
thing was at an end, and nothing could surpass the excitement
and amazement that prevailed. The indignant Tories
exclaimed against intrigue and preconcerted plans, and
asserted that she refused to part with <i>any</i> of her Ladies, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE WHIGS STAND BY THE QUEEN.</span>
that it was only a pretext to break off the Tory Government;
while the Whigs cried out against harshness and dictatorial
demands, and complained that it was intended to make a
thorough clearance, to strip her of all her friends, and destroy
her social comfort. The Radicals, who had for the most
part been terribly alarmed at the results of their own defection,
instantly made overtures to the Whigs; and I heard at
Brooks&rsquo;s that Ward had come over from the Reform Club,
and proposed a reconciliation without any concession, except
that Ballot should be made an open question. There appeared
no disposition to concede anything to the Radicals,
who, they were convinced, would join them without any conditions.</p>

<p>In the meantime Lord Melbourne and Lord John Russell
went to the Queen, who told them her whole story. I met
the latter coming from her; he said, &lsquo;I have just been for
an hour with the Queen; she told me her story, and ended
by saying, &lsquo;I have stood by you, you must now stand by
me.&rsquo; They thought her case a good one, and resolved to
stand by her. Such was the state of things and such the
case as reported to me by several members of the Whig
party yesterday morning, and my impression was that Peel
had been unreasonable in his demands and impolitic in
breaking off the negotiation on such grounds. Nevertheless
I had some misgivings, because I thought the Duke of
Wellington unlikely to concur in any proceeding harsh
towards the Queen, or ill-considered in a political sense; but
the assertion was at the same time so positive, that Peel
had required the dismissal of <i>all</i> the ladies, and the Tories
defended instead of denying this, that I did not doubt the
fact to have been so; and moreover I was told that Peel&rsquo;s
behaviour had created a strong sentiment of dislike towards
him in the Queen, and from her representations and the
language of her letter it was clear the impression on her
mind was that no consideration was intended to be shown
to her feelings and wishes, but, on the contrary, that they
meant to abuse their power to the utmost. At the ball last
night I put the question directly to Lord Normanby and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Ben Stanley, and they both declared that the Queen&rsquo;s understanding
was that the demand for power to dismiss the
Ladies was unqualified by any intimation of an intention not
to exercise that power to the utmost extent; that she
believed they were <i>all</i> to be taken from her, and under this
impression she had sent her ultimatum by which the whole
thing was terminated. But I had afterwards a conversation
with Lord Wharncliffe, who gave me an account of all that
had passed, placed the matter in a very different light, and
proved beyond a doubt that there was no lack of deference and
consideration on the part of Peel, but, on the contrary,
the clearest indication of an intention and desire to consult
her wishes and feelings in every respect, and that, instead of
a sweeping demand for the dismissal of <i>all</i> her Ladies, he
had approached that subject with delicacy and caution, and
merely suggested the expediency of some partial changes,
for reasons (especially when taken with other things) by no means
insufficient. So little disposition was there on the part
of Peel to regard her with distrust or to fetter her
social habits, that when she said, &lsquo;You must not expect me
to give up the society of Lord Melbourne,&rsquo; he replied that
&lsquo;Nothing could be further from his thoughts than to interfere
with Her Majesty&rsquo;s society in any way, or to object to
her receiving Lord Melbourne as she pleased, and that he
should always feel perfectly secure in the honour of Lord
Melbourne, that he would not avail himself improperly of
his intercourse with her.&rsquo; When she said that she should
like to have Lord Liverpool about her, he immediately
acquiesced, and proposed that he should be Lord Steward,
and he suggested certain other persons, whom he said he
proposed because he believed they were personally agreeable
to her; but when he began to talk of &lsquo;some modification
of the Ladies of her household,&rsquo; she stopped him
at once, and declared she would not part with any of
them. Thenceforward this became the whole matter in
dispute; but there had been some circumstances even in the
first interview which Peel and the Duke regarded as
ominous and indicative of her having been primed as to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE TRUE STATE OF THE CASE.</span>
part she should play. The principal of these was an intimation
of her desire that there should be <i>no dissolution of
Parliament</i>. This surprised Peel very much, but he only
replied that it was impossible for him to come to any determination
on that point, as he might be beaten on one of
the first divisions, in which case it would be inevitable. It
was indeed the fact of his taking the Government with a
<i>minority</i> in the House of Commons which was his principal
argument for desiring the power of dismissing the Ladies, or
rather of changing the household, that he might not, he
said, give to the world the spectacle of a Court entirely
hostile to him, consisting of ladies whose husbands were his
strongest political opponents, thereby creating an impression
that the confidence of the Crown was bestowed on his
enemies rather than on himself. In the Duke&rsquo;s first interview
with the Queen, he had entreated her to place her
whole confidence in Peel, and had then said that, though
some changes might be necessary in her household, she
would find him in all the arrangements anxious to meet
her wishes and consult her feelings. Notwithstanding her
assurance to Melbourne that she was calm, she was greatly
excited, though still preserving a becoming dignity in her
outward behaviour.</p>

<p>Having satisfied myself that there had been a complete
misunderstanding, which I think, as it was, might have been
cleared up if there had been less precipitation and more
openness and further endeavours to explain what was doubtful
or ambiguous, I began to turn in my mind whether
something could not be done to avert the impending danger,
and renew the negotiation with Peel while it was still time.
Labouchere had had a conversation with Graham, who had
enlightened him, much as Wharncliffe had me; we came
home together, and I found what Graham had told him had
made a deep impression on him, and that he was as sensible
as I am of the gravity and peril of the circumstances in which
affairs are placed. I accordingly urged Lord Tavistock to
endeavour to persuade Melbourne to see the Duke of Wellington
and talk it over with him; he would at all events learn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the exact truth as to what had passed, which it most essentially
behoves him to know before he takes upon himself the
responsibility of advising the Queen and of meeting Parliament
once more with all the necessary explanations how and
why he is still Minister, and from the Duke likewise he
would learn what really is the <i>animus</i> of Peel and his party,
and what the real extent of their intended demands upon
the Queen. He, and he alone, can enlighten her and pacify
her mind; and if he is satisfied that there has been a misapprehension,
and that Peel has required nothing but what
she ought to concede, it would be his duty to advise her
once more to place herself in Peel&rsquo;s hands. This is the only
solution of the difficulty now possible, and this course, if he
has sufficient wisdom, firmness, and virtue to adopt it, may
still avert the enormous evils which are threatened by the
rupture of the pending arrangements.</p>

<h3>May 12th, 1839</h3>

<p>The Cabinet met yesterday, and resolved
to take the Government again; they hope to interest
the people in the Queen&rsquo;s quarrel, and having made it up with
the Radicals they think they can stand. It is a high trial to
our institutions when the wishes of a Princess of nineteen can
overturn a great Ministerial combination, and when the most
momentous matters of Government and legislation are influenced
by her pleasure about her Ladies of the Bedchamber.
The Whigs resigned because they had no longer that Parliamentary
support for their measures which they deemed
necessary, and they consent to hold the Government without
the removal of any of the difficulties which compelled them
to resign, for the purpose of enabling the Queen to exercise
her pleasure without any control or interference in the choice
of the Ladies of her household. This is making the private
gratification of the Queen paramount to the highest public
considerations: somewhat strange Whig doctrine and practice!
With respect to the question of unfettered choice,
a good deal may be said on both sides; but although it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
would be wrong and inexpedient for any Minister to exercise
the right, unless in a case of great necessity, I think
every Minister must have the power of advising the Queen
to remove a Lady of her Court, in the same way as he is
admitted to have that of removing a man. Notwithstanding
the transaction of 1812, and Lord Moira&rsquo;s protection of
George IV. in the retention of his household, it is now perfectly
established in practice that the Royal Household is at
the discretion of the Minister, and it must be so because he
is responsible for the appointments; in like manner he is
responsible for every appointment which the Sovereign may
make; and should any of the Ladies conduct herself in such
a manner as to lead the public to expect or require her dismissal,
and the Queen were to refuse to dismiss her, the
Minister must be responsible for her remaining about the
Royal person.</p>

<p>The pretension of the Queen was not merely personal,
<i>pro hâc vice</i>, and one of arrangement, but it went to the
establishment of a principle unlimited in its application, for
she declared that she had felt bound to make her stand where
she did, in order once for all to resist the encroachments
which she anticipated, and which would lead, she supposed,
at last to their insisting on taking the Baroness Lehzen herself
from her. In a constitutional point of view, the case
appears to me to be much stronger than in that of a Queen
Consort, for the Minister has nothing to do with a Queen Consort;
he is not responsible for her appointments, nor for the
conduct of her officers, and she is a <i>feme sole</i> possessed of
independent rights which she may exercise according to her
own pleasure, provided only that she does not transgress the
law. It was a great stretch of authority when Lord Grey
insisted on the dismissal of Lord Howe, Queen Adelaide&rsquo;s
Chamberlain; but he did so upon an extraordinary occasion,
and when circumstances rendered it, as he thought, absolutely
necessary that he should make a public demonstration
of his influence in a Court notoriously disaffected to the
Reform Bill.</p>

<p>The origin of the present mischief may be found in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">UNCONSTITUTIONAL COURSE OF THE WHIGS.</span>
objectionable composition of the Royal Household at the
Accession. The Queen knew nobody, and was ready to take
any Ladies that Melbourne recommended to her. He ought
to have taken care that the female part of her household
should not have a political complexion, instead of making it
exclusively Whig as, unfortunately for her, he did; nor is
it little matter of wonder that Melbourne should have consented
to support her in such a case, and that he and his
colleagues should have consented to act the strange, anomalous,
unconstitutional part they have done. While they
really believed that she had been ill-used, it was natural
they should be disposed to vindicate and protect her; but
after the reception of Peel&rsquo;s letter they must have doubted
whether there had not been some misapprehension on both
sides, and they ought in prudence, and in justice to her, even
against her own feelings, to have sifted the matter to the
bottom, and have cleared up every existing doubt before they
decided on their course. But to have met as a Cabinet,
and to have advised her what answer to send to the man
who still held her commission for forming a Government,
upon points relating to its formation, is utterly anomalous
and unprecedented, and a course as dangerous as
unconstitutional.<a name="FNA_06_01" id="FNA_06_01"></a><a href="#FN_06_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The danger has been sufficiently exemplified in
the present case; for, having necessarily had no personal
cognisance of the facts, they incurred the risk of giving advice
upon mistaken grounds, as in this instance has been
the case. <i>She</i> might be excused for her ignorance of the
exact limits of constitutional propriety, and for her too
precipitate recurrence to the counsels to which she had been
accustomed; but <i>they</i> ought to have explained to her, that
until Sir Robert Peel had formally and finally resigned his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
commission into her hands, they could tender no advice, and
that her replies to him, and her resolutions with regard to
his proposals, must emanate solely and spontaneously from
herself. As it was, the Queen was in communication with
Sir Robert Peel on one side, and Lord Melbourne on the
other, at the same time; and through them with both their
Cabinets; the unanimous resolutions of the former being by
her conveyed to, and her answer being composed by, the
latter. The Cabinet of Lord Melbourne discussed the proposals
of that of Sir Robert Peel, and they dictated to the
Queen the reply in which she refused to consent to the advice
tendered to her by the man who was <i>at that moment</i> her
Minister, and it was this reply which compelled him to resign
the office with which she had entrusted him.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_06_01" id="FN_06_01"></a><a href="#FNA_06_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Melbourne explains away this objection by alleging that the negotiation
with Peel was over at six on Thursday; that the Queen sent for him to tell
him so; that he was again become her Minister; and that he and his
colleagues properly advised the terms in which she should convey her final
decision. This explanation seems to have gone down, but I can&rsquo;t imagine
how: the decision to persist in refusing Peel&rsquo;s demands became <i>their</i>
decision, when they advised the letter in which it was conveyed. I know
not why more was not made of this part of the case.</p></div>

<h3>May 13th, 1839</h3>

<p>Lord Tavistock went on Saturday to Buckingham
Palace; found Melbourne was not there, and followed
him to his house, where the Cabinet was sitting. He wrote
him a letter, in which he said that he had seen the Duke,
and that his impression was that there had been a misunderstanding
between Peel and the Queen; and suggested to
Melbourne that he should see the Duke, who was very willing,
if he pleased, to talk the matter over with him. This letter
was taken in to the Cabinet, and they discussed its
contents.<a name="FNA_06_02" id="FNA_06_02"></a><a href="#FN_06_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Melbourne was not indisposed to see the Duke; but, after a
careful consideration of Peel&rsquo;s letter, they came to the conclusion
that there was no difference between the Queen&rsquo;s
statement to them and Peel&rsquo;s to her, and, therefore, no misconception
to correct. The Chancellor accordingly gave his
opinion, that there was no ground for an interview between
Melbourne and the Duke; so then ended the last hope of a
readjustment.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_06_02" id="FN_06_02"></a><a href="#FNA_06_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
Lord Grey was at Melbourne&rsquo;s house; Melbourne sent for him, and
consulted him, and he remained in another room while the Cabinet was in
deliberation. Lord Grey took it up very warmly, and was strongly for
supporting the Queen, saying they could not do otherwise.</p></div>

<p>The question (they say) was all along one of <i>principle</i>,
and never of the <i>application</i> of the principle; but the extraordinary
part of it is that they admit that the principle is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE DEBATE ON THIS TRANSACTION.</span>
maintainable, yet declare that they were bound <i>as gentlemen</i>,
when the Queen had recourse to them, to support her.
This is strange doctrine in Whig mouths. They have, in
my opinion, abandoned their duty to the country and to the
Queen, and they ought to have been impressed with the
paramount obligation of instructing her in the nature and
scope of her constitutional obligations and duties, and the
limits of her constitutional rights, and to have advised her
what she ought to do, instead of upholding her in doing
that which was agreeable to her taste and inclination.</p>

<p>In the meantime Brougham wrote a violent letter to
Lord Tavistock, imploring him, while it was still time, to
arrest the perilous course on which his friends had entered,
and full of professions of regard for him and his. Tavistock
went to him in the evening, found him in a state of furious
excitement, abusing the Ministry greatly, and many of them
by name in the grossest terms, and pouring forth a torrent
of invective against men and things. After a time
he became more cool, and half promised that he would not
speak at all; but when he learnt, what he was not aware
of, that Lord Spencer was come to town and would be in
the House of Lords, he broke out again, and said that if
they had brought him up to support that miserable rotten
concern, he must speak. Lord Spencer was not, however,
brought up by them; he knew nothing of passing events till
he read them in the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; on Saturday, at Barnet, and
his reflexion on them was, that if he should be sent for, he
should advise the Queen to send for Peel again and concede
the point. He is now, however, disposed, in case of need, to
defend his friends in the House of Lords; but if they can
secure Brougham&rsquo;s silence as the price of his, the Ministers
will be glad enough to <i>pair</i> them off.</p>

<h3>May 19th, 1839</h3>

<p>At Mickleham (for Epsom) from Tuesday to
Friday, and, of course, nothing done, written, heard, or
thought of, save and except the Derby. The explanations
went off, on the whole, very well, without acrimony, and
as satisfactorily as the case allowed. Peel&rsquo;s speech was
excellent (though Lord Grey did not approve of it, and regretted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
not having the power to answer it), and without any
appearance of art or dexterity he contrived to steer through
all the difficult points and to justify himself without saying
a word offensive to the Queen. Lord John Russell was
very nervous, feeble and ineffective. In the other House
Melbourne made, as all allow, a capital speech; Clarendon,
a good and fair judge, told me that he never heard Melbourne
speak so well throughout; while the Duke was
painful to hear, exhibiting such undoubted marks of caducity:
it did not, however, read ill. Melbourne made one
admission, for which Lord John Russell was very angry with
him, and that was of the &lsquo;erroneous impression&rsquo; on the
Queen&rsquo;s mind, because his argument was that there was &lsquo;no
mistake.&rsquo; Lord Grey and Lord Spencer would either of
them have spoken, but it was deemed better they should not,
or Brougham would have been unmuzzled, and as it was he
adhered to his engagement to Lord Tavistock and held his
peace. He had said, &lsquo;If you let off Althorp or old Grey, I
must speak.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>June 1st, 1839</h3>

<p>Laid up with the gout and confined to my
room for ten days, very ill and utterly disinclined to write.
Nothing new of consequence, but little things keep oozing
out, throwing light on the recent transaction, and all tending
to the same conclusion. In the meantime Parliament
met, but nothing has been done. Lord John Russell began
by deferring the Education question, which he will be
obliged to abandon, for the Church has risen up and put
forth all its strength against it, and having been joined by
the Wesleyans, will, without difficulty, defeat it. The
Bishop of London made a most eloquent philippic against it
at Exeter Hall the other day. Government have brought in
another Jamaica Bill, not very different from Peel&rsquo;s proposed
measure, and which they will probably contrive to
pass.</p>

<p>The Radicals have been again bestirring themselves, and
trying to turn the present occasion to account and extract
some concessions from the Government. Warburton has
been in communication with Lord John Russell, and they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD BROUGHAM ATTACKS MINISTERS.</span>
expect some declarations from him and Melbourne of their
future intentions, and some indications of a disposition to give
way on some of the favourite Radical measures. Melbourne&rsquo;s
intention was to be elicited by certain questions of which
Lord Winchilsea gave notice, and which he actually put
last night, as to the principles on which the Government
was to be conducted. Melbourne replied in a very guarded
and somewhat didactic style, but, so far from evincing any
disposition to make Radical concessions, he intimated with
sufficient clearness that he was resolved to make none
whatever, and that he would not sacrifice his conscientious
convictions for any political or party purpose.</p>

<p>After this, up got Brougham, and that boiling torrent of
rage, disdain, and hatred, which had been dammed up upon
a former occasion when he was so unaccountably muzzled,
broke forth with resistless and overwhelming force. He
spoke for three hours, and delivered such an oration as no
other man in existence is capable of: devilish in spirit and
design, but of superhuman eloquence and masterly in execution.
He assailed the Ministers with a storm of invective
and ridicule; and, while he enveloped his periods in a
studied phraseology of pretended loyalty and devotion, he
attacked the Queen herself with unsparing severity. He
went at length and in minute detail into the whole history
of the recent transaction, drew it in its true colours, and
exposed its origin, progress, and motives, and thus he laid
bare all the arts and falsehoods by which attempts had been
made to delude and agitate the country. If it were possible
to treat this as a party question, his speech would be a
powerful party auxiliary, most valuable to the Tories as a
vindication of them, for it was the peculiar merit of this
speech that it abounded in truths and in great constitutional
principles of undoubted authority and unerring application.
The Duke of Wellington rose after Brougham: in a short
speech, replete with moderation and dignity, he abstained
from entering upon the past, but fastened upon Melbourne&rsquo;s
declaration, and gave him to understand that as long as he
adhered to such principles as he had then declared he would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
be governed by, he might appeal to Parliament confidently
for support.</p>

<p>These three speeches have all in their different ways produced
a great effect: Melbourne&rsquo;s will not satisfy the Radicals,
though they catch (as dying men at straws) at a vague
expression about &lsquo;progressive reforms,&rsquo; and try (or pretend)
to think that this promises something, though they know
not what. Brougham&rsquo;s speech was received by the Tory Lords
with enthusiastic applause, vociferous cheering throughout,
and two or three rounds at the conclusion. But the Duke&rsquo;s
assurance of support to Melbourne exasperated his own
people to the greatest degree, produced a sulky article in
the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; and the usual complaints at White&rsquo;s and the
Carlton of the Duke&rsquo;s being in his dotage, and so forth.
Even some of his real admirers thought he &lsquo;had overdone it,&rsquo;
and whilst at Brooks&rsquo;s they did not quite know what to
make of it, at the Carlton they were in the same doubt how
to interpret Melbourne&rsquo;s cautious ambiguities. Both, however,
were clear enough: Melbourne meant to say he would
&lsquo;go no further,&rsquo; and the Duke meant to pat him on the
back, and promise him that while he adhered to that resolution
he should have no vexatious opposition to fear; but his
meaning was made still more clear, for he told my brother
this afternoon that &lsquo;it was of the greatest importance to nail
Melbourne to his declaration, and that they must do what
they could to help the Queen out of the difficulty in which
she was placed.&rsquo; He looks to the Crown of England; he
wants to uphold <i>it</i> and not to punish <i>her</i>; and he does not
care to achieve a Tory triumph at the expense of the highest
Tory principle; he thinks the Monarchy is in danger, and
he sees that the danger may be more surely averted by still
enduring the existence of the present Government, depriving
them of all power to do evil, and converting them into
instruments of good, than by accelerating their fall under
circumstances calculated to engender violent animosities,
irreconcileable enmities, wide separation of parties, and the
adoption of extreme measures and dangerous principles by
many who have no natural bias that way. I entirely concur
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MACAULAY ELECTED FOR EDINBURGH.</span>
with him, and if it were possible to restore matters to something
like the state they were in before the Bedchamber
crisis, nothing would be so desirable; nothing so desirable
as that the Whigs and the Radicals should be furnished with
fresh occasion to fall out, and the dissolution of the Government
be the final consequence of their dissensions. Also it
is expedient that time should be given for the angry waters
to become smooth and calm once more, albeit the smoothness
is only on their surface.</p>

<p>Yesterday the Grand Duke
Alexander<a name="FNA_06_03" id="FNA_06_03"></a><a href="#FN_06_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
went away after
a stay of some three weeks, which has been distinguished by
a lavish profusion&mdash;perhaps a munificence&mdash;perfectly
unexampled; he is by no means remarkable in appearance one
way or the other, and does not appear to have made any great
impression except by the splendour and extent of his presents
and benefactions: he has scattered diamond boxes and rings
in all directions, subscribed largely to all the charities, to
the Wellington and Nelson memorials, and most liberally
(and curiously) to the Jockey Club, to which he has sent a
sum of 300&#8467;., with a promise of its annual repetition.</p>

<p>Macaulay is gone to Edinburgh to be elected in the room
of Abercromby, so he is again about to descend into the
arena of politics. He made a very eloquent and, to my surprise,
a very Radical speech, declaring himself for Ballot and
short Parliaments. I was the more astonished at this,
because I knew he had held very moderate language, and
I remembered his telling me that he considered the Radical
party to be reduced to &lsquo;Grote and his wife,&rsquo; after which I
did not expect to see him declare himself the advocate of
Grote&rsquo;s favourite measure and the darling object of the
Radicals.</p>

<h3>June 7th, 1839</h3>

<p>Macaulay&rsquo;s was a very able speech and a good
apology for the Whig Government, and as he has always
been for Ballot, he is not inconsistent. On Sir H. Fleetwood&rsquo;s
motion the other night (for giving votes for counties
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
to ten-pound householders), John Russell spoke out, though
in a reforming tone, and threw the Radicals into a paroxysm
of chagrin and disappointment. The Tories had heard he was
going to give way, and Peel, who is naturally suspicious and
distrustful, believed it; but when he found he would not
give way, nor held out any hopes for the future, Peel nailed
him to that point and spoke with great force and effect.
This debate was considered very damaging to Whigs and
Radicals, and likely to lead to a dissolution&mdash;first, of
Parliament, and then of Government. But the Radicals are now
adopting a whining, fawning tone, have dropt that of bluster
and menace, and, having before rudely insisted on a mighty
slice of the loaf, are now content to put their tails between
their legs and swallow such crumbs as they can get. Peel
has written and published a very stout letter, in reply to a
Shrewsbury declaration presented to him, in which he defends
his recent conduct, and declares he will never take
office on any other terms.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Lord John Russell&rsquo;s speech on Fleetwood&rsquo;s
motion, and Melbourne&rsquo;s anti-movement declaration
in the other House, they have to their eternal disgrace
succumbed to the Radicals, and been squeezed into making
Ballot an open question. For John Russell I am sorry. I
thought he would have been stouter. The Radicals are full
of exultation, and the Government underlings, who care not
on what terms they can retain their places, are very joyful.
I rode with Howick yesterday for a long time and talked it
over with him. He pretended it was no concession after
Vivian&rsquo;s being allowed to vote last year, and he owned that
he considered the question as virtually carried; he is himself
moderate and means still to vote against it, sees all the
danger&mdash;not so much from Ballot itself as from its inevitable
train of consequences&mdash;and still consents to abandon the
contest. I asked him, if he was not conscious that it was
only like buying off the Picts and Scots, and that fresh
demands would speedily follow with redoubled confidence;
and he owned he was. It may prolong for a brief period the
sickly existence of the Government, and if a dissolution comes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE WHIGS SUCCUMB TO THE RADICALS.</span>
speedily, Whigs and Radicals may act in concert at the
elections; but if they attempt to go on with the present
Parliament fresh demands will rapidly ensue, and then there
must be fresh concessions or another breach. It is a base
and disgusting truckling to allies between whom and
themselves there is nothing but mutual hatred and contempt.</p>

<h3>June 14th, 1839</h3>

<p>At Holland House from Tuesday till
Thursday&mdash;not particularly agreeable. Melbourne came one day,
but was not in spirits. Lord Holland told me some stories
of George Selwyn, whom he had known in his younger days,
and many of whose good sayings he remembers. He describes
him as a man of great gravity and deliberation in
speaking, and, after exciting extraordinary mirth by his wit
and drollery, gently smiling and saying, &lsquo;I am glad you are
pleased.&rsquo; The old Lord Foley (father of the last) was much
discontented with his father&rsquo;s will, who, knowing that he
was in debt and a spendthrift, had strictly tied up the
property: he tried to set aside the will by Act of Parliament,
and had a Bill brought into the House of Lords for the
purpose. George Selwyn said, &lsquo;Our old friend Foley has
worked a miracle, for he has converted the Jews from the
Old to the New Testament.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>June 24th, 1839, Ludlow</h3>

<p>I left London on Friday last by
railroad, went to Wolverhampton (the vilest-looking town I
ever saw), and posted in my carriage from thence to this
place, where I only arrived at a quarter-past nine. This
journey takes (losing no time) about eleven and a half hours&mdash;one
hundred and fifty miles&mdash;of which thirty-four by road.
The road from Bridgenorth to Ludlow is very striking and
commands exceedingly fine views.</p>

<p>The day before I left town I saw Lord Tavistock, who
told me divers things. I asked him what could induce Lord
John to consent to making Ballot an open question, and he
replied, that nothing else could have prevented the dissolution
of the Government, and that <i>three</i> of the Ministers&mdash;he
did not say which&mdash;threatened to resign instanter if this
concession was not made. Here then, as I said to him, was
another example of the evils of that catastrophe which broke
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
up the embryo Government of Peel and brought them back
again: unable to go on independently and as they desire to
do, they are obliged to truckle, and are squeezed into
compliances they abhor, and all this degradation they think
themselves bound to submit to because the principle on which
their Government stands, and which predominates over all
others, is that of supporting the Queen. No Tory Government
ever ventured to dissociate its support of the Queen
from its measures and principles as a party, in the way these
men do. Macaulay made his first re-appearance in the Ballot
debate in a speech of unequal merit, but Peel and Graham
complimented him on his return amongst them.</p>

<p>I am greatly delighted with this country, which is of surpassing
beauty, and the old Castle of Ludlow, a noble ruin,
and in &lsquo;ruinous perfection.&rsquo; On Saturday I explored the
Castle and walked to Oakley Park, Robert Clive&rsquo;s, who is
also the owner of the Castle, which he bought of the Crown
for 1,500&#8467;. The gardens at Oakley Park are very pretty and
admirably laid out and kept, and the park is full of fine
oaks. Yesterday I walked and rode over the hills above
Ludlow, commanding a panoramic prospect of the country
round, and anything more grand and picturesque I never
beheld. But above all, the hills and woods of Downton
Castle, with the mountains of Radnorshire in the distance,
present a scene of matchless beauty well worth coming from
London to see.</p>

<h3>June 26th, 1839, Delbury</h3>

<p>I rode to Downton Castle on Monday,
a gimcrack castle and bad house, built by Payne Knight,
an epicurean philosopher, who after building the castle went
and lived in a lodge or cottage in the park: there he died,
not without suspicion of having put an end to himself, which
would have been fully conformable to his notions. He was a
sensualist in all ways, but a great and self-educated scholar.
His property is now in Chancery, because he chose to make
his own will. The prospect from the windows is beautiful,
and the walk through the wood, overhanging the river
Teme, surpasses anything I have ever seen of the kind. It
is as wild as the walk over the hill at Chatsworth, and much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LUDLOW, MALVERN, ROSS.</span>
more beautiful, because the distant prospect resembles the
cheerful hills of Sussex instead of the brown and sombre
Derbyshire moors. The path now creeps along the margin,
and now rises above the bed of a clear and murmuring stream,
and immediately opposite is another hill as lofty and wild,
both covered with the finest trees&mdash;oaks, ash, and chestnut&mdash;which
push out their gnarled roots in a thousand fantastic
shapes, and grow out of vast masses of rock in the
most luxuriant and picturesque manner. Yesterday I came
here, a tolerable place with no pretension, but very well kept,
not without handsome trees, and surrounded by a very pretty
country.</p>

<h3>June 28th, 1839, Malvern</h3>

<p>Returned to Ludlow yesterday;
came here to-day: the road from Ledbury to Malvern wonderfully
fine, and nothing grander than the view of Eastnor
Castle.</p>

<h3>July 3rd, 1839, Troy House</h3>

<p>Stayed at Malvern two days,
clambering to the top of the hills which overhang the place
(for town it is not), from which the views are very fine over
a rich but generally flat country; the prospect is grand
from its great extent. There is a curious and interesting
church there, formerly of some priory, with a handsome
gateway. I came through Eastnor Park in the way to Ledbury,
exceedingly fine, and the castle something like Belvoir
apparently, but I was not permitted to approach it. Nothing
particular in the road till Ross, a very pretty town, where I
first met the Wye, but, alas, in its muddiest state: this was
the abode of &lsquo;The Man of Ross.&rsquo; Very pretty road from
Ross to Monmouth, through which latter place I walked,
and passed by a very old house, which, as I afterwards
heard, is said to have been the abode of Geoffrey of Monmouth,
and they show his study. Troy, a plain, good-looking
house, imperfectly kept up and poorly furnished, as a house
is likely to be whose owners never inhabit it. It was built
by the Duke of Beaufort in 1689, who came to sulk here on
the expulsion of the last of the Stuarts, having a deeply-rooted
sentiment of hereditary loyalty. <i>Multa fecerunt</i> and
<i>multa tulerunt</i>, certainly, for that unhappy race. Here they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
show a chair in which <i>a plot</i> was contrived against Charles I.&mdash;that
is, &lsquo;in which the president of the conspirators is said
to have sat.&rsquo; The story was obscure, but I did not think it
advisable to press the narrator for explanations. Likewise
a cradle, which tradition assigns to Henry V. (Harry of
Monmouth), which is evidently old enough and was splendid
enough in a rude style to justify any such tradition; the
only unfortunate thing is, that there is a rival cradle
somewhere else with the same claim. Mr. Wyatt, the Duke&rsquo;s
agent, received me with great civility and hospitality, having
been enjoined by the Duke to make me his guest and himself
my <i>cicerone</i>. Accordingly we set forth on Monday morning
and went to Usk Castle, a ruin of which not much is left
besides a picturesque round tower; neither the Castle nor
the country is very remarkable, but we brought home a
crimped salmon, for which Usk is famous (and where the
crimping is said to be a secret unattainable even to the
vendors of Wye and Severn salmon), which was, without
exception, the most dainty fish I ever ate. From Usk we
returned to Raglan Castle, a most noble and beautiful ruin;
there has often been a notion of restoring it, and an estimate
was made of the probable expense, which was calculated
at 30,000&#8467;.; but the idea and the estimate are equally
preposterous: it would be reconstructing a very unmanageable
house and destroying the finest ruin in England, and the
cost would infallibly be three times 30,000&#8467;. As there had
been a question of its restoration, I expected to find greater
and more perfect remains, but, though some of the apartments
may be made out, it is a vast wreck. The strange
thing is that the second Marquis of Worcester, when his
possessions were restored to him, and when the damage
done to the castle might easily have been repaired, should
not have done it nor any of his immediate descendants.
Great pains are now taken to preserve the beauties of this
majestic fabric and to arrest the further progress of decay.
Yesterday I rode to Goodrich Castle, stopping to see some
remarkable views of the Wye, particularly one called
Simmons Yat or Rock, which is very beautiful (and must be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">GOODRICH CASTLE, TINTERN ABBEY.</span>
much more so when the river is clear and transparent); and
a curious rock called the Buck-stone, which was probably a
Druidical place of worship, but of which nothing is positively
known, though conjecture is busy. Goodrich Castle, which
was partly battered down by the Cromwellians like Raglan,
is more ancient, and was much stronger than the latter; but,
though not so beautiful and splendid, it is an equally curious
and interesting ruin, with many of its parts still more
perfect than anything at Raglan. I was exceedingly delighted
with Goodrich, and there was a female <i>custos</i>, zealous
and intelligent, whose husband, she told us, was continually
occupied in clearing away rubbish and exposing the
remains of the old Castle. We then went to Goodrich
Court, a strange kind of bastard castle built by Blore, and
which the possessor, Sir Samuel Meyrick, has devoted to the
exhibition of his collection of armour. There are only a few
acres of ground belonging to him, on which he has built this
house, but it is admirably situated, overhanging the Wye
and facing the Castle, of which it commands a charming
view. After being hurried through the armoury, which was
all we were invited to inspect, we embarked in a boat we
had sent up, and returned to Monmouth down the Wye
through some beautiful scenery, but which it was too cold to
enjoy.</p>

<h3>July 4th, 1839, Clifton</h3>

<p>I came here last night, the wind
having changed to S.W., and summer having come with it.
I left Troy in the morning and went to Tintern Abbey:
most glorious, which I could not describe if I would, but
which produced on me an impression similar in kind and
equal in amount to that which I felt at the sight of St.
Peter&rsquo;s. No description nor any representation of it can do
justice, or anything like justice, to this majestic and beautiful
ruin, such is its wonderful perfection viewed in every direction,
from every spot, and in the minutest detail. That the
remains should be so extensive and so uninjured is marvellous,
for there can be no doubt that this Abbey might be
restored to its former grandeur. Much has been done by
Mr. Wyatt, the Duke&rsquo;s agent, both to preserve the Abbey
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and to develope its beauties by cutting away the trees and
ivy, and clearing away the accumulation of earth; by the
latter means several tombs and many detached fragments of
beautiful design and workmanship have been found, and I
did my best to encourage him to pursue his researches.</p>

<p>Casting many lingering looks behind, I left Tintern and
went to Windcliffe, from the summit of which there is a
very fine view; but the Wye, instead of being an embellishment,
is an eyesore in the midst of such scenery: it looks
like a long, slimy snake dragging its foul length through
the hills and woods which environ its muddy stream. We
dined in a moss-cottage at the foot of Windcliffe, and then
proceeded to Chepstow, a very curious and striking ruin,
and which I should have seen with much greater interest
and admiration if Tintern had not so occupied my thoughts
and filled my mind that I had not eyes to do justice to
Chepstow. I went all over the ruins, however, and examined
them very accurately; for it is one of the great merits of
these different castles, Raglan, Goodrich, and Chepstow,
that they are wholly dissimilar, and each is therefore a fresh
object of curiosity. I crossed the old passage, as it is called,
in a ferry, and came on to Clifton.</p>

<p><i>Bath.</i>&mdash;After taking a cursory view of Clifton from the
Roman Camp and part of Bristol, I came to Bath, where
I have not been these thirty years and more. I walked
about the town, and was greatly struck with its
handsomeness; thought of all the vicissitudes of custom and
fashion which it has seen and undergone, and of the various
characters, great and small, who have figured here. Here the
great Lord Chatham used to repair devoured by gout, resentment,
and disappointment, and leave the Government to its
fate, while his colleagues waited his pleasure submissively
or caballed against his power, according as circumstances
obliged them to do the first or enabled them to do the
second. Here my uncle, Harry Greville, the handsomest
man of his day, used to dance minuets while all the company
got on chairs and benches to look at him, and a few years
since he died in poverty at the Mauritius, where he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BATH, SALISBURY CATHEDRAL.</span>
gone to end his days, after many unfortunate speculations,
in an office obtained from the compassion of Lord
Bathurst. <i>Sic transit gloria mundi</i>, and thus its frivolities
flourish for their brief hour, and then decay and are
forgotten. An old woman showed me the Pump-room and the
baths, all unchanged except in the habits and characters of
their frequenters; and my mind&rsquo;s eye peopled them with
Tabitha Bramble, Win Jenkins, and Lismahago, and with
all the inimitable family of Anstey&rsquo;s creation, the Ringbones,
Cormorants, and Bumfidgets&mdash;Tabby and
Roger.<a name="FNA_06_04" id="FNA_06_04"></a><a href="#FN_06_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<h3>July 5th, 1839, Salisbury</h3>

<p>I saw the Abbey Church at Bath
this morning, which is handsome enough, but not very
remarkable, unless for the vast crowds of its tombstones in
every part; it has been completely repaired by the corporation
at a great expense. I went to Stonehenge, of which no
description is necessary; thence to Wilton; very fine place;
hurried through the gallery of marbles, but looked longer at
the pictures, which I understand and taste better; saw the
gardens and the stud, and then came here; went directly to
the Cathedral, with which I was exceedingly delighted,
having seen nothing like it for extent, lightness, and
elegance. There is one modern tomb by Chantrey which is
very fine, that of Lord Malmesbury, erected by his sister;
but, however skilfully executed or admirably designed, I
do not like such monuments so well, nor think them so
appropriate to our cathedrals, as the rude effigies of knights
and warriors in complete armour, with their feet on couchant
hounds, or those stately though sometimes gaudy and fantastic
monuments, in which, among crowds of emblematical
devices and armorial bearings, the husband and the wife lie
side by side in the richest costume of the day, while their
children are kneeling around them; these, with the venerable
figures of abbots and bishops, however rudely sculptured,
give me greater pleasure to look upon than the
choicest productions of Roubillac, Nollekens, or Chantrey,
which, however fine they may be, seem to have no business
there, and to intrude irreverently among the mighty dead of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
olden time. This cathedral is in perfect repair within and
without; the colour of the stone is singularly beautiful, and
it is not blocked up with buildings, Bishop Barrington
having caused all that were adjacent to be removed. The
chapter house and cloisters are exceedingly fine, but the
effect is spoilt in the former by great bars of iron which
radiate in all directions from a ring attached to the supporting
pillar, and which have been put there (probably without
any necessity) to relieve it of a portion of the superincumbent
weight. It is remarkable that wherever I have gone in my
travels, I have found the same complaints of the mischievous
propensities of that silly, vulgar, vicious animal, called the
public. Amongst the beauties of nature or of art, rocks,
caves, or mountains, in ruined castles and abbeys, or ancient
but still flourishing cathedrals, the same invariable love of
pilfering and mutilating is to be found: some knock off a
nose or a finger, others deface a frieze or a mullion from
sheer love of havoc, others chip off some unmeaning fragment
as a relique or object of curiosity; but the most general
taste seems to be that of carving names or initials, and some
of the ancient figures are completely tattooed with these
barbarous engravings: this propensity I believe to be peculiar
to our nation, and not to be found in any part of the
Continent, where, indeed, it would probably not be permitted,
and where detection and punishment would speedily
overtake the offender. It is quite disgusting to see the
venerable form of a knight templar or a mitred abbot
scarred all over with the base patronymics of Jones and
Tomkins, or with a whole alphabet of their initials.</p>

<h3>July 7th, 1839</h3>

<p>I came to town yesterday from Basingstoke by
railroad; found that Lady Flora Hastings was dead, and a
great majority in the House of Lords in favour of an Address
to the Crown against the proposed Committee of Council on
Education, the Bishop of London having made an extraordinarily
fine speech.</p>

<h3>July 14th, 1839</h3>

<p>Nothing new; proceedings in Parliament
very languid. The Queen has appointed Lady Sandwich
very dexterously, for she gets one of the favoured Paget

<span class="pagehead">DUKE OF WELLINGTON&rsquo;S ANGRY VEIN.</span>
race and the wife of a Tory peer, thereby putting an end to
the exclusively Whig composition of the Household. This
is a concession with regard to <i>the principle</i>.</p>

<h3>July 19th, 1839</h3>

<p>There have been angry debates in the Lords
about the Birmingham riots, chiefly remarkable for the
excitement, so unlike his usual manner, exhibited by the
Duke of Wellington, who assailed the Government with a
fierceness which betrayed him into much exaggeration and
some injustice. Lord Tavistock, who, although a partisan,
is a fair one, and who has a great esteem and respect for the
Duke, told me that he had seen and heard him with great
pain, and that his whole tone was alarmingly indicative of a
decay of mental power. This is not the first time that such
a suspicion has been excited: George Villiers told me, soon
after he came over, how much struck he had been with the
change he observed in him, and from whatever cause, he is
become in speaking much more indistinct and embarrassed,
continually repeating and not always intelligible, but his
speeches, when reported, present much the same appearance,
and the sense and soundness (when the reporters have lopped
off the redundancies and trimmed them according to their
fashion) seem to be unimpaired. It is, however, a serious
and melancholy thing to contemplate the possibly approaching
decay of that great mind, and I find he always contemplates
it himself, his mother&rsquo;s mind having failed some
years before her death. It will be sad if, after exploits as
brilliant as Marlborough&rsquo;s, and a career far more important,
useful, and honourable, he should be destined for an end like
Marlborough&rsquo;s, and it is devoutly to be hoped that his eyes
may be closed in death before &lsquo;streams of dotage&rsquo; shall
begin to flow from them. The Tories, with whom nothing
goes down but violence, were delighted with his angry vein,
and see proofs of vigour in what his opponents consider as
evidence of decay; his bodily health is wonderfully good,
which is perhaps rather alarming than reassuring as to the
safety of his mind.</p>

<h3>July 22nd, 1839</h3>

<p>I met the Duke yesterday at dinner and had
much talk with him. He is very desponding about the state
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of the country and the condition in which the Government
have placed it. He complains of its defenceless situation
from their carrying on a war (Canada) with a peace
establishment; consequently that the few troops we have are
harassed to death with duty, and in case of a serious outbreak
that there is no disposable force to quell it; that the
Government are ruled by factions, political and religious.
On Saturday they had been beaten on a question relating to
the Poor
Laws<a name="FNA_06_05" id="FNA_06_05"></a><a href="#FN_06_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
of great importance; and he said that they
must be supported in this, and extricated from the difficulty.
I was glad to meet him and see (for it is some time since I
have talked to him) whether there was any perceptible
change in his manner or any symptom indicative of decay.
Without there being anything tangible or very remarkable,
I received the impression that there was not exactly the
same vigour of mind which I have been used to admire in
him, and what he said did not appear to me indicative of the
strong sense and acuteness which characterise him. If he
has no attack, I dare say he will be able to continue to act
his part with efficacy for a long time to come. I asked him
in what manner Government would prosecute the inquiry
they had promised into the conduct of the Birmingham
magistrates? He said what they ought to do was to order
the Attorney-General to prosecute them for a corrupt neglect
of their duty, a thing they would as soon put their hands in
the fire as do. Such is their position, so dependent upon
bad men, that they are compelled to treat with the utmost
tenderness all the enemies of the Constitution. There can
be no doubt that the appointments to the magistracy have
been fraught with danger, and made on a very monstrous
principle. When Lord John Russell resolved and avowed
his resolution to neutralise the provision of the Act which
gave the appointment of magistrates to the Crown instead of
to the Town Council (as they had proposed) by taking the
recommendations of the Council, he incurred the deepest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RADICAL MAGISTRATES.</span>
responsibility that any Minister ever did, for he took on
himself to adopt a course practically inconsistent with the
law, for the express purpose of placing political power in
particular hands, to which the law intended it should not be
confided; and on him, therefore, rested all the responsibility
of such power being wisely and safely exercised by the hands
to which he determined to entrust it; and when he appoints
such a man as
Muntz,<a name="FNA_06_06" id="FNA_06_06"></a><a href="#FN_06_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
ex-Chartist and ex-Delegate, what
must be the impression produced on all denominations of
men as to his bias, and of what use is it to make professions,
and deliver speeches condemnatory of the principles and
conduct of Chartists and associators, if his acts and
appointments are not in conformity with those professions? Mr.
Muntz, he says, has abandoned Chartism, and is no longer
the man he was: but who knows that? For one man who
knows what Muntz is, a hundred know what he was, and
in the insertion of his name in the list the bulk of the
world will and can only see, if not approbation of, at least
indifference to the doctrines such men have professed, and
the conduct they have exhibited to the world. It is the
frightful anomaly of being a Government divesting itself of
all conservative character, which constitutes the danger of our
day. As the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; in one of its spirited articles, says, this
very morning, &lsquo;that it cares not to see the Monarchy broken
in pieces so that they may hurl its fragments at the heads of
their opponents.&rsquo;</p>

[Whatever the antecedents of Mr. Muntz may have been, he lived to
justify Lord John Russell&rsquo;s choice. He was not only a good magistrate,
but member for Birmingham for many years, and a useful member. He
was the first man who, in our time, wore a long beard in the House.]</p></div>

<h3>July 25th, 1839</h3>

<p>Lord Clarendon made his first appearance in
the House of Lords the night before last in reply to Lord
Londonderry on Spanish affairs, with great success and excellent
effect, and has completely landed himself as a Parliamentary
speaker, in which, as he is certain to improve with
time and practice, he will eventually acquire considerable
eminence; and nothing can prevent his arriving at the highest
posts. He is already marked out by the public voice for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Foreign Office, for which he is peculiarly well fitted, and there
is no reason why he should not look forward to being Prime
Minister in some future combination of parties, a post which
he would fill better than any of the statesmen who now play
the principal parts in the political drama. The Government
have at last taken fright, and have proposed troops and police
to afford the country some sort of security during the recess
and the winter. They have sent down Maule (the Solicitor
to the Treasury) to Birmingham to investigate the evidence
adducible against the magistrates, but I do not much expect
that they will proceed to any extremities against them.

<p>Brougham brought on his motion on
Tuesday,<a name="FNA_06_07" id="FNA_06_07"></a><a href="#FN_06_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
in spite of various attempts to dissuade him; but he
could not resist the temptation of making a speech, which he
said he expected would be the best he had ever delivered.
He spoke for three hours in opening, and an hour and a
quarter in reply, and a great performance by all accounts it
was. The Duke of Wellington said it was the finest speech
he had ever heard in Parliament. Normanby was miserably
feeble in reply, and exhibited, by common consent, a sad
failure, both on this occasion and on that of the Canada Bill.
He is quite unequal to the office which has been thrust upon
him, and he cannot speak upon great subjects, having no
oratorical art or power of dealing skilfully and forcibly with
a question. It was a very damaging night to the Government
as far as
reputation<a name="FNA_06_08" id="FNA_06_08"></a><a href="#FN_06_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
is concerned, but in no other

<span class="pagehead">FREAKS OF LORD BROUGHAM.</span>
way, for they are perfectly callous, and the public entirely
apathetic. Melbourne was very smart in reply to Brougham,
but did not attempt to deal with the question. The case,
after all, is not a very strong one, and, though Normanby
was much to blame in releasing prisoners and commuting
sentences in the manner and to the extent he did, the
principle on which he acted was sound, and it has proved
beneficial. Had he known how, and been equal to the task, he
might have made a fine defence by taking a high instead of
a deprecatory line, and by a confident appeal to results; but
it required more of an orator and a statesman than he is to
handle his case with sufficient effect, and to stand up against
such a master of his art as Brougham, backed by a favourable
audience. This curious and versatile creature is in the
highest spirits, and finds in the admiration which his eloquence,
and the delight which his mischievousness excite on
the Tory benches and in Tory society, a compensation for
old mortifications and disappointments. After acting Jupiter
one day in the House of Lords, he is ready to act Scapin
anywhere else the next; and the day after this great display
he went to dine at Greenwich with the Duchess of Cambridge
and a great party, where he danced with Lady Jersey,
while Lyndhurst capered also with the Dowager Lady Cowper.
After dinner they drank, among other toasts, Lady Jersey&rsquo;s
health, and when she said she could not return thanks,
Brougham undertook to do it for her, speaking in her person.
He said, that &lsquo;She was very sorry to return thanks in such a
dress, but unfortunately she had quarrelled in the morning
with her maid, who was a very cross, crabbed person, and
consequently had not been able to put on the attire she
would have wished, and in the difficulty she had had recourse
to her old friend Lord Brougham, who had kindly lent her
his best wig and the coat which he wore upon state occasions.&rsquo;
After more nonsense of this kind, that &lsquo;she was very
sorry she could not say more, but that in the peculiar
situation she then was in, she could not venture to remain any
longer on her legs.&rsquo;</p>

was then being read, all the urchins from eight to eleven or
twelve years old, I thought I had never seen a congregation
of more unpromising and ungainly heads, and accordingly
they are the worst and lowest specimens of humanity;
starved, ill-used children of poor and vicious parents, generally
arriving at the school weak and squalid, with a tendency
to every vice, and without having received any moral or intellectual
cultivation whatever; but the system, under able

these rude materials, and soon elicits manifestations of intelligence,
and improves and developes the moral faculties.

not to reflect with shame and sorrow upon the little,

the total absence of any system throughout
places of education, either public or private, and consequently
at the imperfect and defective education which is
given to the highest and richest class of society, who are
brought up thus stupidly at an enormous expense, acquiring
little knowledge, and what they do acquire, so loosely and
incompletely as to be of the smallest possible use. When
one sees what is done here, it makes one think what ought
to be done elsewhere, and then contrast the possible with

<h3>August 15th, 1839</h3>

<p>This eventful Session and season has
at length closed, Lyndhurst having wound up by a <i>résumé</i> of
the acts of the Government, in one of those &lsquo;exercitations,&rsquo;
as Melbourne calls them, which are equally pungent for
their severity, and admirable for their lucidity. Melbourne
made a bitter reply, full of personalities, against Lyndhurst,
but offering a meagre defence for himself and his colleagues.
Those who watch the course of events, and who occasionally
peep behind the curtain, have but a sorry spectacle to contemplate:&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Government miserably weak, dragging on a
sickly existence, now endeavouring to curry a little favour
with one party, now with another; so unused to stand, and
so incapable of standing, on any great principles, that at
last they have, or appear to have, none to stand on. Buffeted
by their antagonists, and often by their supporters
in Parliament, despised by the country at large, clinging
to office merely to gratify the Queen, while they are just
sufficiently supported in the House of Commons to keep
their places, and not enough to carry their measures; for so
meagre are their majorities, and so little do the public care
for those majorities, or for the Ministers or their measures,
that the Lords do not scruple to treat the Ministerial Bills
with undisguised contempt. At the beginning of this Session,
the weakness of the Government, and the impossibility of
their going on, were so obvious, that the more wise and
moderate of them began to prepare for their retirement, and
Lord John Russell, by the publication of his Stroud letter,
and the expression of those opinions which I was the means
of conveying to Peel, evinced his determination to make the
dissolution of the Government ancillary to the ascendency
of true Conservative principles. The break-up came sooner
than had been expected, and when Ministers resigned, on
the majority of five on the Jamaica Bill (which they need not
have done), they acted wisely, for they were enabled to retire
with dignity, Peel and the Opposition having been clearly
and flagrantly in the wrong upon this particular measure&mdash;so
wrong, that it has been, and still is, matter of astonishment
to me why they gave battle upon it, and I suspect that
Peel was by no means elated at his own success on that
occasion. However, out they went upon the Jamaica question,
and though they fancy Peel did not really wish to form a
Government, and that the difficulties he made were only a
pretext for escaping from his position, this is not the case;
he had no misgivings or fears, and was quite ready to undertake
the task. However, <i>Diis aliter visum</i>: the Queen kept
Lord Melbourne, and they came back to accumulated difficulties,
and without any augmentation of parliamentary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">A SINKING MINISTRY.</span>
strength or popular sympathy to sustain them. They made
one miserable effort, and tossed a sop to the Radicals, by
making the Ballot an open question, the grace and utility of
which were entirely marred by Lord Howick&rsquo;s speech, so
that they got all the discredit of this concession without any
compensatory advantage. They had begun the campaign
by the abrupt expulsion of Glenelg (nobody has ever made
out exactly why) and by bringing over Normanby in breathless
haste to supersede him, without any reasonable probability
of his giving such an accession of vigour and capacity
to the Government as would justify this operation, and
accordingly as more than ordinary success was requisite for
a man promoted under such circumstances, the deeper were
the mortification and disappointment at his failure. The
Irish Committee, which put him on the defence of his
administration there, distracted his attention and disturbed
his mind, and he turned out to be unequal to his situation.
His defence of himself upon Ireland was very weak, and his
whole parliamentary conduct of colonial affairs lamentably
inefficient. Then Mr. Spring Rice kept falling into continual
discredit by his financial incompetence, so that day after
day, from one cause or another, the Ministry sank in estimation,
and got more weak and ridiculous. Of this they were
not at all unconscious, and it was settled that something
was to be done, though the difficulty both as to the manner
and the matter was exceedingly great. Rice himself was
eager to escape, and tried hard to be Speaker; but though the
Cabinet had resolved he should be the Government candidate,
it was found that no adequate support could be depended
upon for him, and he was obliged, and they were obliged, to
let Lefevre stand instead; at which Rice himself was so
sulky that he showed his spite by contriving to arrive too
late from Tunbridge for the division. They scrambled on
till the end of the Session, when the changes which had long
been discussed and battled were to take place, and then,
naturally, came into play all the vanity, selfishness, and
rival pretensions, which a sense of common danger could not
silence. In the arrangement of all these things, Melbourne
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
is said to have severely suffered, so repugnant is it to his
nature and habits to be the arbiter and adjuster of rival
claims and pretensions.</p>

<p>It seems to have been arranged long ago that Normanby
and John Russell should change places, ostensibly that the
Colonial Minister might be in the House of Commons, and
really because Normanby broke down, so that it was necessary
to harness Lord John to the Colonial machine. Then they
determined to send Poulett Thomson to Canada, without
any consideration of the effect such an appointment would
produce, either here or there, and his vacancy opened a fresh
embarrassment about the Board of Trade. Labouchere
having quitted the Vice-Presidency, and gone to the Colonial
Office to work for them when they were in difficulty, was
considered to have made a sacrifice, and he demanded as its
reward that he should step into Poulett Thomson&rsquo;s place, and
his seat in the Cabinet. Melbourne wanted to offer the
Board of Trade to Clarendon, and wrote to him to beg he
would not go abroad without seeing him, and intimated that
he had something to propose to him. On the other hand,
Howick put in a claim for Charles Wood, and argued that
as he had long taken a labouring oar in the boat, and in this
Session, when they had got into a scrape about the Navy,
Wood had successfully defended the Government in the
House of Commons in a very good speech,&mdash;this eminent
service, together with a long career of usefulness, gave him
a superior claim to promotion. The details of the contest
between these various candidates I do not know, but the
result was that Labouchere got the place, Howick and
Charles Wood both resigned, and Clarendon had a conversation
with Melbourne, in which the latter informed him, not
without embarrassment, that he had been in hopes he
should have had the Board of Trade to offer him, but that
Labouchere&rsquo;s claim had been deemed not postponable, and
all he had to offer him was the Mint without the Cabinet.
Clarendon refused this with perfect good humour, though
certainly not much flattered at the offer, and he took the
opportunity of putting Melbourne in possession of his thoughts,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">POULETT THOMSON SENT TO CANADA.</span>
both as to his own position and intentions, and the condition
and prospects of the Government, with respect to which he
did not mince matters, or fail to paint them in their true
colours. He explained his own desire to try himself more
in debate than he had been yet enabled to do, to see what
he was fit for, and in the meantime owned that he had no
particular desire to associate himself with such a rickety
concern. The conversation was frank and characteristic,
and must have been amusing. Melbourne acknowledged
that he was quite right, and that the position of his
Government was such as Clarendon described it.</p>

<p>Nothing strikes one more forcibly in the contemplation of
these things, than the manner in which the public interests
are complimented away for the sake of individual pretensions,
and even in this there is an apparent caprice which is
inexplicable. Glenelg, an honourable and accomplished man, is
thrust out under very humiliating circumstances. Poulett
Thomson, we are told, &lsquo;must have been&rsquo; Chancellor of the
Exchequer, if not Governor of Canada (a post he is by way
of taking as a favour to his colleagues), &lsquo;he could not be
passed over.&rsquo; Why he could not, and in what his right consisted,
it is difficult to say, nor why he is entitled to such
amazing deference, while poor Glenelg was so unceremoniously
treated. Poulett Thomson is clever and industrious,
but his elevation, when compared with that of others, and
with his own merit, as well as original means of raising
himself, exhibits a very remarkable phenomenon, and as Lord
Spencer, his early patron, has pretty well withdrawn from
public affairs, it is not very obvious how or why Poulett
Thomson is enabled to render his small pretensions so largely
available. The Duke would not believe they meant to send
him to Canada, and said they had much better leave Colborne
there; but this is what they fancy they can&rsquo;t do, and
that they must send out somebody who is to solve the political
problem of settling the future form of government, and
so Poulett goes to finish what Durham began.</p>

<h3>September 4th, 1839</h3>

<p>The changes in the Government have
been received with considerable indifference, nobody much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
caring, and the generality of people finding fault with some
or all of them. Normanby told me yesterday that he was
fully sensible of the inconvenience of such changes, and of
the bad effect they are calculated to produce, but that the
appointment of Poulett Thomson was John Russell&rsquo;s doing,
that he had been bent upon it, and had carried it, and as he
(Normanby) could not consent to it, and would not be immediately
responsible for it, nothing was left but to change
offices, and let the appointment of Poulett Thomson to
Canada be Lord John&rsquo;s own doing, who would thus administer
the affairs of the Colony with a Governor of his own
choice. He added, that it had been originally intended (when
he left Ireland) that he should take his present office, but
other circumstances had obliged him at that time to go to
the Colonies. While Normanby quits the Colonies, because
Thomson goes to Canada (as he says), Howick (as <i>he</i> says)
resigns, because Normanby goes to the Home Office. But
the world believes that the change of the one takes place,
because Normanby is unequal to the work of the Colonies,
and the resignation of the other, because Howick was not
himself appointed Colonial Secretary. The ostensible ground
for the change is, that the Minister who brings forward the
Canada question in the House of Commons may be well
versed in all the official details, and have immediate personal
control over the local administration; and the excuse for
sending out Thomson, and accepting Colborne&rsquo;s resignation,
is the necessity of appointing a Governor thoroughly acquainted
with all that has passed both abroad and at home,
cognisant of the intentions, and possessed of the confidence
of the Cabinet. All this will appear to furnish inadequate
grounds for recalling Colborne, who has acted with sense and
vigour, albeit not pretending to be a statesman or a legislator.
A story is told, which shows the levity of the Government
people, and how they make game of what might be
thought matter of anything but pleasantry to them. At the
end of the season there is always a fish dinner at Greenwich,
the whipper-in (Secretary of Treasury), Ben Stanley, in the
chair; and this is on the plan of the Beefsteak Club, everybody
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">A GREENWICH DINNER.</span>
saying what he pleases, and dealing out gibes and jests
upon his friends and colleagues according to the measure of
his humour and capacity. Normanby, still smarting from
the attacks of Brougham, was made the mark for these
jocularities, after his health being drunk thus: &lsquo;Lord Normanby
and the liberation of the Prisoners.&rsquo; At a subsequent
period, Rutherford, the Lord Advocate, attacked the
Attorney-General, and said he had long known his learned
friend as the advocate of liberty, but he had lately seen him
in quite a new capacity, prosecuting in the Tory fashion,
and having people shut up in jail in all parts of the country.
Campbell said it was very true that he had lately had a very
unpleasant duty to perform, and that he had been the unwilling
instrument of incarcerating many of Her Majesty&rsquo;s
subjects, but that he had all along been consoled by the
reflexion that there was every probability of his noble friend
Lord Normanby making a progress, during the recess, and
letting them all out again. Normanby, however, did not
like the witticism, and complained afterwards that the dinner
was very dull, and the jokes exceedingly heavy.</p>

<p>The Dover dinner to the Duke of
Wellington,<a name="FNA_07_01" id="FNA_07_01"></a><a href="#FN_07_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
which took place the other day, did not present an agreeable spectacle.
Brougham, who had thrust himself in among the
party, was pitched upon, as having the best gift of the gab,
to propose the Duke&rsquo;s health, which he did in a very tawdry
speech, stuffed with claptraps and commonplaces. It was
a piece of bad taste to select Brougham (who had nothing to
do with Dover) for the performance of this office, which
would have been more appropriately discharged by the local
authority in the chair, although he might not have been
able to make such a flourish as the practised orator favoured
the company with. The Duke himself hates to be thus bepraised,
and it is painful to see Brougham and him in any
way connected, though for so ephemeral a purpose.
The Duke&rsquo;s health might be proposed in three lines of Ovid,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
which express the position he fills more, and probably better,
than the most studied oration could do:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0;">It turned out a complete <i>Tory</i> celebration. There was an
almost unmixed array of Tory names at the banquet, and
one Whig lord (Poltimore), who happened to be at Dover
declined attending.</p>

[A great entertainment was given to the Duke of Wellington as Lord
Warden of the Cinque Ports on the 30th August. Lord Brougham attended
it, and delivered an oration of the most hyperbolical panegyric.]</p></div>

<h3>September 5th, 1839</h3>

<p>Among other bad signs of these times,
one is the decay of <i>loyalty</i> in the Tory party; the Tory principle
is completely destroyed by party rage. No Opposition
was ever more rabid than this is, no people ever treated or
spoke of the Sovereign with such marked disrespect. They
seem not to care one straw for the Crown, its dignity, or its
authority, because the head on which it is placed does not
nod with benignity to them. An example of this took place
the other day, when at a dinner at Shrewsbury the company
refused to drink the health of the new Lord Lieutenant, the
Duke of Sutherland (a man not personally obnoxious), because
the Duchess of Sutherland is at the head of the Queen&rsquo;s female
household. This reproach does not apply to the leaders of
the party, who are too wise and too decorous to hold such
language or to approve of such
conduct;<a name="FNA_07_02" id="FNA_07_02"></a><a href="#FN_07_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
but is the <i>animus</i>
which distinguishes the tail and the body, and they take no
pains to conceal it.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_02" id="FN_07_02"></a><a href="#FNA_07_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
This was before the Bradshaw and Roby exhibitions.</p></div>

<h3>September 7th, 1839</h3>

<p>The result of the Cambridge and Manchester
elections proves (if any proof was wanting), how
utterly the cause of Government is lost in the country, and
fully confirms the report of their universal unpopularity:
Cambridge lost by one hundred, and Manchester barely won.
Poulett Thomson told me just before that the Liberals had
a certain majority (for any candidate) of several hundreds.</p>

<h3>September 14th, 1839</h3>

<p>Brougham has sent to the press a letter to
the Duke of Bedford on Education, of which he thus speaks
in a letter to Lord Tavistock:... &lsquo;I have sent my letter to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BROUGHAM&rsquo;S LETTER ON EDUCATION.</span>
the Duke to the press at Edinburgh. I wrote it in eight
and a half hours the day I came here; but if I am to judge,
who should not, it is by far the best thing I ever did, and
the only eloquent. My whole heart was in it, both from
affection to your excellent father, and to the subject. I hope
it will do good, for the time is going away under me, and I
shall be called to my great account before I have done any
good on earth. Therefore I must make a new attempt at
having something to show.&rsquo; The production will be probably
very good in its way and very eloquent, but the note
is characteristic&mdash;a mixture of pride and humility, humbugging
and self-deceitful. What cares he for the Duke of
Bedford, whom he scarcely sees from one end of the year to
the other, and why should he care? They have very little
in common&mdash;neither the <i>idem velle</i> nor <i>idem nolle</i>; and a
more uninteresting, weak-minded, selfish character does not
exist than the Duke of
Bedford.<a name="FNA_07_03" id="FNA_07_03"></a><a href="#FN_07_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
He is a good-natured,
plausible man, without enemies, and really (though he does
not think so) without friends; and naturally enough he does
not think so, because there are many who pretend, like
Brougham, a strong affection for him, and some who imagine
they feel it. Vast property, rank, influence, and station
always attract a sentiment which is dignified with the name
of friendship, which assumes all its outward appearance,
complies with its conditions, but which is really hollow and
unsubstantial. The Duke of Bedford thinks of nothing but
his own personal enjoyments, and it has long been a part of
his system not to allow himself to be disturbed by the necessities
of others, or be ruffled by the slightest self-denial.
He is affable, bland, and of easy intercourse, making rather
a favourable impression on superficial observers; caring little,
if at all, for the wants or wishes of others, but grudging
nobody anything that does not interfere with his own pursuits,
and seeing with complacency those who surround him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
lap up the superfluities which may chance to bubble over
from his cup of pleasure and happiness. It is a farce to talk
of friendship with such a man, on whom, if he were not Duke
of Bedford, Brougham would never waste a thought.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_03" id="FN_07_03"></a><a href="#FNA_07_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
[These remarks relate to John, sixth Duke of Bedford, born 6th July,
1766, died 29th October, 1839. He was the father of the Lord Tavistock
often mentioned in these Journals, and of Lord William and Lord John
Russell.]</p></div>

<h3>September 17th, 1839</h3>

<p>Finding the Duke of Wellington was in
town yesterday, I called on him. He talked to me a great
deal about Brougham and the Dover dinner, and told me a
comical anecdote with reference to his giving the toast of
the Duke&rsquo;s health at the dinner. The Committee invited
him and, as the chairman was a man who could not speak
at all, they, thinking it a catch to get so great an orator to
do the office, proposed to Brougham to give the toast of the
night. He accepted, and then they found that Lord Guilford,
a man of the first rank and consequence in the county,
and therefore entitled to this distinction, was highly affronted
at the preference of Brougham to him. They got embarrassed,
and desired to take the toast from Brougham and
give it to Lord Guilford, and when he got down there this
was suggested to him; but he said &lsquo;it could not be, for he
had not only written his speech beforehand, but had already
sent it to be published, so that no alteration was then
possible.&rsquo; The consequence was, Lord Guilford would not
come to the dinner, and he was only pacified afterwards by
the Duke himself, who went to call upon him for the purpose
of soothing down his ruffled plumage; this he succeeded in
doing by telling him this story, and nothing the Duke said
reconciled him so much to what had passed, as the fact
of Brougham&rsquo;s having written his speech beforehand.</p>

<p>He told me what Brougham had said of Macaulay (whom
he hates with much cordiality), when somebody asked if he
was to be Secretary at War. &lsquo;No, Melbourne would not
consent to it: he would not have him in the Cabinet, and
could not endure to sit with ten parrots, a chime of bells,
and Lady W&mdash;&mdash;.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The more I see of the Duke, the more am I struck with
the impression that he is declining; that he is not what he
was a year or two ago. He is vigorous and hearty, cheerful,
lively; his memory does not seem to be impaired; he talks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE AFGHAN EXPEDITION.</span>
with sense and energy. If anybody asserted that they saw
symptoms of mental decay, it would be easy to deny the
fact, and to support the denial by ready and numerous
examples of his force and sagacity in discussion, or in the
transaction of business; but nevertheless I am persuaded
that a change has come over him, that it is gradually
spreading more and sinking deeper, and that we must begin
to make up our minds to the deprivation of his noble spirit,
full of honesty, wisdom, and patriotism as it
is.<a name="FNA_07_04" id="FNA_07_04"></a><a href="#FN_07_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_04" id="FN_07_04"></a><a href="#FNA_07_04"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
[The Duke, however, lived and flourished for thirteen years after this
prediction.]</p></div>

<h3>September 21st, 1839</h3>

<p>I dined at Holland House last night,
where, among others, were General Alava, and Sir John
Hobhouse, the first in high glee at the termination of the
war in Spain, and the last at the success of the Indian
expedition.<a name="FNA_07_05" id="FNA_07_05"></a><a href="#FN_07_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Hobhouse told me that Auckland had displayed
extraordinary qualities, and was the ablest Governor India
had seen for a great length of time. Alava said that the last
transactions in Spain and the mediation of Lord John Hay
had reflected the highest honour on our Government, and
that we had acted with a discretion, a delicacy, and a disinterestedness
beyond all praise. But both Alava and
Hobhouse told me what is very remarkable as showing the
great reliance which even his political opponents place in the
wisdom and patriotism of the Duke. Hobhouse said that he
had had some time ago a very long conversation with the
Duke, in which he had made him acquainted with all the
means employed for the accomplishment of their Indian
objects, and that the Duke, who had previously anticipated
their failure, had, after hearing all these details, expressed
himself perfectly satisfied, and admitted that they had every
assurance of success. He did not go into the policy of the
measure, which it would not have been proper or advisable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to do, but merely treated the question of military resources
and their employment.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_05" id="FN_07_05"></a><a href="#FNA_07_05"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
[This was the expedition to replace Shah Sooja on the throne of
Afghanistan, which was so auspiciously commenced and so deplorably
terminated. Sir John Hobhouse was greatly elated at the enterprise and
very confident of the result. He said to me soon afterwards that we must
encounter the policy of Russia, and that the theatre of the struggle was
Central Asia. I replied that I should have preferred the Baltic.&mdash;H.R.]</p></div>

<p>So, too, Alava, as soon as intelligence reached him and
Palmerston of the overtures of Maroto, asked leave to communicate
it to the Duke, which was immediately conceded.
He was therefore informed of all that was going on, and it
met with his fullest approbation; and yet all this time
the great organ of the Tories is raving against the Government
in the most frantic manner, for having been instrumental
to this happy termination of the most frightful and
revolting civil war that ever afflicted any
country.<a name="FNA_07_06" id="FNA_07_06"></a><a href="#FN_07_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_06" id="FN_07_06"></a><a href="#FNA_07_06"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
[The active support given to Espartero by the British Government under
the Quadruple Treaty, and the operations of Lord John Hay on the northern
coast of Spain, which stopped the supplies of the Carlists, contributed to
bring the contest for the Crown of Spain to an end, and on the 15th August
Don Carlos surrendered himself to the French Government at Bayonne.]</p></div>

<h3>September 23rd, 1839</h3>

<p>Lady Holland asked me the other night
what I thought of their prospects, and I told her I thought
them very bad. She said, &lsquo;The fact is, we have nothing to
rely upon but the Queen and Paddy.&rsquo; This has since struck
me as being an epigrammatic but very correct description of
their position.</p>

<p>Last night there came to Holland House after dinner Brunnow
and Nesselrode&rsquo;s son, the first (not unlike Brougham,
and would be very like if his nose moved about), a very able
man, and said to be &lsquo;la pensée intime de l&rsquo;Empereur,&rsquo; sent
over to see what can be done about the Eastern Question,
which I take to be a very difficult
matter.<a name="FNA_07_07" id="FNA_07_07"></a><a href="#FN_07_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
I had much talk with Dedel (who told me this) about Palmerston. I said
it was well known he was very able with his pen, but
I did not know how he was in Conference. He replied:
&lsquo;Palmerston comes to any Conference so fully and completely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD BROUGHAM&rsquo;S PRETENDED DEATH.</span>
master of the subject of it in all the minutest details,
that this capacity is a peculiar talent with him; it is so
great, that he is apt sometimes to lose himself in the
details.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_07" id="FN_07_07"></a><a href="#FNA_07_07"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
[Baron Brunnow was sent to England at this time by the Emperor
Nicholas to make the first overtures for the intervention of the Great Powers
in the quarrel between the Sultan and the Pasha of Egypt. This overture
was rejected by the Cabinet in 1839, but accepted on the Baron&rsquo;s return to
England in the following year, and it led to the celebrated treaty of the
15th July, 1840, and the quarrel with France, the true object of Nicholas
having been the severance of the Western Powers. M. de Brunnow remained
in England as Minister or Ambassador for nearly thirty-five years.]</p></div>

<h3>London, November 8th, 1839</h3>

<p>Six weeks nearly of an absolute
blank. Left town October 1, Newmarket, then Cromer for
ten days, Newmarket, London, Riddlesworth, Newmarket
again, Euston, and back on Monday last. Nothing very
remarkable has happened in this interval. Lord
Clarendon<a name="FNA_07_08" id="FNA_07_08"></a><a href="#FN_07_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
accepted the Privy Seal, not very willingly, but feeling that
he could not, with decency, refuse it. They consider his
accession to the Government a matter of great importance,
and the Tories own it to be so, such a reputation has he
acquired by the brilliant manner in which he conducted the
mission in Spain, and by his popular and engaging qualities.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_08" id="FN_07_08"></a><a href="#FNA_07_08"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
[George William Frederic Villiers, fourth Earl of Clarendon, succeeded
his uncle in the title in December, 1838. He had filled for some years with
distinguished ability the office of British Minister at Madrid. He now returned
to England; married Lady Katharine Barham, eldest daughter of the
Earl of Verulam and widow of John Forster-Barham, Esq., in June 1839,
and entered the Cabinet for the first time as Lord Privy Seal.]</p></div>

<p>Nothing has excited so much interest as the hoax of
Brougham&rsquo;s pretended
death,<a name="FNA_07_09" id="FNA_07_09"></a><a href="#FN_07_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
which was generally believed
for twenty-four hours, and the report elicited a host of
criticisms and panegyrics on his life and character, for the
most part flattering, except that in the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; which was
very able but very severe, and not less severe than true. As
soon as it was discovered that he was not dead, the liveliest
indignation was testified at the joke that had been played
off, and the utmost anxiety to discover its origin. General
suspicion immediately fixed itself on Brougham himself,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
who, finding the bad impression produced, hastened to remove
it by a vehement but indirect denial of having had any
share in, or knowledge of, the hoax. But so little reliance
is placed upon his word, that everybody laughs at his denials,
and hardly anybody has a shadow of a doubt that he was
himself at the bottom of it. He has taken the trouble to
write to all sorts of people, old friends and new, to exonerate
himself from the charge; but never was trouble more thrown
away. D&rsquo;Orsay says that he carefully compared the (supposed)
letter of Shafto with one of Brougham&rsquo;s to him,
and that they were evidently written by the same hand.
The paper, with all its marks, was the same, together with
various other minute resemblances, leaving no doubt of the
fact.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_09" id="FN_07_09"></a><a href="#FNA_07_09"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
[A letter from Brougham purporting to be from Mr. Shafto was
received by Mr. Alfred Montgomery, which contained the particulars of
Lord Brougham&rsquo;s death by a carriage accident. Mr. Montgomery brought
the letter to Lady Blessington&rsquo;s at Gore House, where I happened to be, and
I confess we were all taken in by the hoax. Montgomery went off in a
post-chaise to break the news to Lord Wellesley at Fernhill; and meeting
Lord Alfred Paget in Windsor Park, he sent the news to the Castle. The
trick was kept up for twenty-four hours, but the next day I received a note
from Brougham himself, full of his usual spirits and vitality.&mdash;H.R.]</p></div>

<p>Next to this episode, Jemmy Bradshaw&rsquo;s speech at Canterbury
has attracted the greatest attention, and he has
been for many days the hero of newspaper discussion. This
speech, which was a tissue of folly and impertinence, but
principally remarkable for a personal attack of the most
violent and indecent kind upon the Queen, was received with
shouts of applause at a Conservative dinner, and reported
with many compliments, and some gentle reprehension by
the Tory press. His example has since been followed in a
less offensive style by two others calling themselves Tories&mdash;a
Mr. Roby and a Mr. Escott. Of these rabid and disloyal
effusions, the Government papers have not failed to make
the most, by pointing out the disaffected and almost treasonable
character of modern Toryism when embittered by exclusion
from office; and there is no doubt that, contemptible
as the authors are, their senseless and disgusting exhibitions
are calculated to do great mischief; for, if no other evil
ensued, it is one of no small consequence to sour the mind
of the Queen still more against the whole Tory party, and
fasten upon her an impression which it will be difficult to
efface, that she is odious and her authority contemptible in
their eyes, so long as she is unfavourable to them, and commits
herself to other hands than theirs. Peel is to be pitied
for having to lead such an unruly and unprincipled faction.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">VIOLENCE OF THE TORIES.</span>
Everything seems disjointed, all is confusion; moderate men,
desirous of good government, stability, security, and safe
amendment of political evils or errors, can find no resting-place.
The Tories, the professors and protectors of Conservative
principles, the abhorrers of changes, who would
not have so much as a finger laid upon the integrity of the
Constitution, are ready to roll the Crown in the dirt, and
trample it under their feet; and the Government, to whom
the maintenance of the Constitution is entrusted, whose
especial duty it is to uphold the authority of the laws, are
openly allied with, and continually truckling to, those factions,
or sections of factions, which make no secret of their desire
and determination to effect changes which nobody denies to
be equivalent to revolution; and then we have the weight of
the Crown thrown into the scale of this unholy alliance,
from the mere influence of personal predilections and antipathies.
To such a degree is principle dormant, or so entirely
is it thrust into the background by passion, prejudice, or the
interest of the passing hour.</p>

<h3>November 13th, 1839</h3>

<p>At Holland House for three days last
week. Lord Holland told many stories of Lord Chatham,
some of which I had heard before, and some not. His
stories are always excellent, and excellently told, and those
who have heard them before can very well bear to hear them
again. I think I have somewhere inserted the &lsquo;Sugar&rsquo;
story, which Lord Harrowby told me many years ago, but
without the vivacity and good acting of Lord Holland.
Another of his sayings was in the House of Lords, when,
on I forget what question, he was unsupported: &lsquo;My Lords,
I stand like our First Parents&mdash;alone, naked, but not
ashamed.&rsquo; This was fine. Lord Holland said there was
nothing like real oratory in Parliament before the American
war.</p>

<p>He had received several letters from Brougham in a most
strange, incoherent style, avowedly for the purpose of thanking
Lady Holland for the interest he heard she had shown
about him when his death was reported, and at the same
time to explain that he had no hand in the report, which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
did with the utmost solemnity of
asseveration;<a name="FNA_07_10" id="FNA_07_10"></a><a href="#FN_07_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
but he took
this opportunity to descant on the conduct of the party
towards him, of the press, of the people, and of the leading
Whigs, talked of the flags of truce he had held out, and how
they had been fired on, and that he must again arm himself
for another fight. All this in a curious, disjointed style.
As these letters were considered flags of truce, Lady Holland
fired upon them an invitation to dinner, but he would not
come. I met him on Sunday, and asked him why he did
not come, but he would not give any answer whatever. On
that occasion he talked for two hours without stopping,
abusing one person after another, particularly Fonblanque,
and then telling the whole history of the Reform Bill and of
the famous dissolution, and of all his own exploits on that
occasion. It was amusing enough, but he talks too much,
and his talk has the grand fault of not impressing his
hearers with an idea of its truth; it is lively, energetic,
vivacious, abundant, but it is artificial and unsatisfactory,
because liable to suspicion and doubt.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_10" id="FN_07_10"></a><a href="#FNA_07_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
It was well known, eventually, that the hoax was entirely his own,
and the letter dictated by himself.</p></div>

<h3>Windsor Castle, November 15th, 1839</h3>

<p>Here for a Council. I
sat next to Baroness Lehzen at dinner&mdash;a clever, agreeable
woman. She complained of Peel&rsquo;s having said in the House
of Commons that he did not mean to turn her out, and says
he ought to have said he could not, and that he had nothing
to do with her, as she is not in the public service. I defended
Peel. In the evening, Lord Melbourne told me to search
the Council books and see what was the form of declaration
of the Sovereign&rsquo;s marriage, so that matter is pretty clearly
settled.</p>

<h3>November 23rd, 1839</h3>

<p>At Wolbeding for three days. Then
news came of the Duke&rsquo;s illness, which, though it turned
out to be exaggerated, will, I fear, prove to have given him
a shake. The Council being summoned to declare the Queen&rsquo;s
marriage to-day, I have come up to town for it, and am just
returned from the declaration, which took place in the lower
apartments of the palace. About eighty Privy Councillors
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE QUEEN&rsquo;S BETROTHAL.</span>
present, all who were within call having attended. Peel,
Lyndhurst, and the Duke. The Duke arrived last night for
the purpose; he looked very old, very feeble, and decrepit.
I thought a great change was observable in him, but he was
cheerful as usual, and evidently tried to make the best of it.
The Queen had sent in the morning to enquire after him,
and the answer was, &lsquo;He had had a restless night.&rsquo; All the
Privy Councillors seated themselves, when the folding-doors
were thrown open, and the Queen came in, attired in a plain
morning-gown, but wearing a bracelet containing Prince
Albert&rsquo;s picture. She read the declaration in a clear, sonorous,
sweet-toned voice, but her hands trembled so excessively
that I wonder she was able to read the paper which she held.
Lord Lansdowne made a little speech, asking her permission
to have the declaration made public. She bowed assent,
placed the paper in his hands, and then retired.</p>

<h3>November 26th, 1839</h3>

<p>The Queen wrote to all her family and
announced her marriage to them. When she saw the Duchess
of Gloucester in town, and told her she was to make her
declaration the next day, the Duchess asked her if it was
not a nervous thing to do. She said, &lsquo;Yes; but I did a
much more nervous thing a little while ago.&rsquo; &lsquo;What was
that?&rsquo; &lsquo;I proposed to Prince Albert.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Duke of Cambridge hunted Brougham round the
room, saying, &lsquo;Oh, by God, you wrote the letter; by God,
you did it
yourself.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_07_11" id="FNA_07_11"></a><a href="#FN_07_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Brougham is in a state of prodigious
excitement. He has had a reconciliation with Normanby,
and another with Durham&mdash;the first at Lady Clanricarde&rsquo;s,
the other at Lady Tankerville&rsquo;s, where they casually met.
He was overflowing with sentiment and eagerness to be
friends with both.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_11" id="FN_07_11"></a><a href="#FNA_07_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>
[Meaning the letter to Alfred Montgomery which announced Lord
Brougham&rsquo;s death.]</p></div>

<h3>November 27th, 1839</h3>

<p>The Queen settled everything about her
marriage herself, and without consulting Melbourne at all
on the subject, not even communicating to him her intentions.
The reports were already rife, while he was in ignorance;
and at last he spoke to her, told her that he could not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
be ignorant of the reports, nor could she; that he did not
presume to enquire what her intentions were, but that it was
his duty to tell her, that if she had any, it was necessary that
her Ministers should be apprised of them. She said she had
nothing to tell him, and about a fortnight afterwards she
informed him that the whole thing was settled. A curious
exhibition of her independence, and explains the apprehensions
which Lady Cowper has recently expressed to me of
the serious consequences which her determined character is
likely to produce. If she has already shaken off her dependence
on Melbourne, and begins to fly with her own wings,
what will she not do when she is older, and has to deal with
Ministers whom she does not care for, or whom she dislikes?</p>

<h3>December 14th, 1839</h3>

<p>I was at Oatlands a fortnight ago, where
I met Croker&mdash;not overbearing, and rather agreeable, though
without having said much that was peculiarly interesting.
Two things struck me. He said he dined and passed the
evening <i>tête-à-tête</i> with the Duke of Wellington (then Sir
Arthur Wellesley) before his departure for Portugal to take
the command of the army. He was then Irish Secretary,
and had committed to Croker&rsquo;s management the bills he
had to carry through Parliament. After dinner he was very
thoughtful, and did not speak. Croker said, &lsquo;Sir Arthur,
you don&rsquo;t talk; what is it you are thinking about?&rsquo; He
said, &lsquo;Of the French. I have never seen them; they have
beaten all Europe. I think I shall beat them, but I can&rsquo;t
help thinking about them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Another <i>tête-à-tête</i> he had with the Duke was at the time
of the Reform Bill, when he went down with him for a week
to Strathfieldsaye, during which time he was more low-spirited
and silent than Croker said he ever saw him before
or since. He reproached himself for what he had done,
particularly about Catholic Emancipation, the repeal of the
Test Act, and his resignation in &rsquo;30. Very curious this, not
alluding among the topics of self-reproach to his persevering
and mischievous opposition to the Emancipation, which he
at length conceded in a manner so fraught with future evil,
however inevitable; nor to his famous Anti-reform declaration,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE MAYOR OF NEWPORT AT COURT.</span>
which, though containing little if anything that was
untrue, was so imprudent that its effects were enormous
and irretrievable. Such is the blindness, the obstinate reluctance
to the admission of error, which besets even the
wisest and the best men; for if the Duke of Wellington
could have divested his mind of prejudice, and reflected
calmly on the past, or looked over the political map of bygone
events with the practical sagacity he usually displayed, he
never could have failed to perceive the true causes of them.
People often take to themselves unmerited blame, to screen
themselves from that which they are conscious they deserve.</p>

<p>On Monday last I went to Windsor for a Council. There
we had Sir Thomas Phillips, the Mayor of Newport, who
came to be knighted. They were going to knight him, and
then dismiss him, but I persuaded Normanby that it would
be a wise and popular thing to keep him there and load him
with civilities&mdash;do good to the Queen, encourage others to
do their duty&mdash;and send him back rejoicing to his province,
to spread far and wide the fame of his gracious reception.
He said, that etiquette would not permit one of his rank in
life to be invited to the Royal table. I said, that this was all
nonsense: if he was good enough to come and be knighted,
he was good enough to dine there, and that it was a little
outlay for a large return. He was convinced; spoke to
Melbourne, who settled it, and Phillips stayed. Nothing could
answer better, everybody approved of it, and the man behaved
as if his whole life had been spent in Courts, perfectly at his
ease without rudeness or forwardness, quiet, unobtrusive, but
with complete self-possession, and a <i>nil admirari</i> manner
which had something distinguished in it. The Queen was
very civil to him, and he was delighted. The next morning
he went to Normanby, and expressed his apprehension that
he might not have conducted himself as he ought, together
with his grateful sense of his reception; but the apology
was quite
needless.<a name="FNA_07_12" id="FNA_07_12"></a><a href="#FN_07_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

[On the 4th November a Chartist riot occurred at Newport in Monmouthshire.
The leaders were John Frost and Zephaniah Williams. The
Mayor, Mr. T. Phillips, behaved with great gallantry, and ordered the troops
to load. The mob, said to be 20,000 strong, first fired on the troops, who
then returned the fire with effect and dispersed the assemblage. John Frost,
the leader of this disturbance, had unluckily been made a magistrate by Lord
John Russell some time before. His trial is subsequently adverted to.]</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
At Ampthill (Baron Parke&rsquo;s) last Friday.
Took down with me David Dundas, a Whig lawyer, and a very
agreeable accomplished man, plenty of pleasant talk. Went
over to Wrest, Lord de Grey&rsquo;s new house&mdash;built, decorated,
and furnished by himself&mdash;and very perfect in all ways.
Heard on Sunday a Mr. Howorth preach&mdash;an admirable
preacher, who ought to be promoted in the Church, just as
Dundas ought in the

<h3>December 31st, 1839</h3>

<p>We are arrived at the end of the year,
and the next will begin with the Chartist trials. Parliament is
about to meet. Parties are violent, Government weak, everybody
wondering what will happen, nobody seeing their way
clearly before them. The general opinion is, that the Opposition
mean to take the Government if they can by storm, and
will assault every weak point. The weakest, to my mind,
is John Russell&rsquo;s appointment of Frost to the magistracy,
which, if skilfully handled, may be brought against him with
great effect. Frost was appointed in pursuance of a system
Lord John chose to establish, for the purpose of defeating the
intentions of Parliament; and he did it upon his own responsibility
in spite of warnings against it, and now we see some
of the fruits of this policy. I told Normanby this, and he
owned the truth of it, and moreover he told me that the
system he found established by Lord John had proved very
embarrassing to him, as it was very difficult for him to throw
it over, and unless he did so he should be compelled to make,
or sanction, objectionable appointments. Such have been
the consequences of Lord John&rsquo;s unstatesmanlike and perhaps
unconstitutional conduct, adopted under the influence
of resentment.</p>

<p>Lord Clarendon, who has just joined the Government
with a lively sense of the tottering character of the concern
he has entered, is resolved, as far as his influence may avail,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD CLARENDON TAKES OFFICE.</span>
to urge them to cast aside all attempts to catch votes, and
cajole supporters, by partial concessions and half-and-half
measures, to look the condition of affairs steadily in the face,
and act in all things according to the best of their minds
and consciences, as if they were as strong a Government as
Pitt&rsquo;s, and without any regard to consequences, so that they
may either live usefully or die honourably. This is the true
course, and that which I have urged him to enforce with all
his credit. We had some talk about foreign affairs. He
thinks there is danger of Palmerston&rsquo;s getting too closely
connected with Russia, while keeping France in check
upon the complicated Eastern Question. He also spoke
of a curious pamphlet, just published by Marliani, a Spaniard,
who went in 1838 with Zea Bermudez on a mission
to Berlin and Vienna, stating that a proposal had been made
to Austria for a marriage between the young Queen of Spain
and a son of the Archduke Charles, by which the Austrian
alliance and influence would again be substituted for the
French, and the object of the Family Compact defeated;
and that Metternich would have listened eagerly to this if
he had dared, and was only prevented and induced to entreat
the Spaniards to go away by his overwhelming dread of
Russian indignation.</p>

<h3>January 14th, 1840</h3>

<p>At Wrest for the last week. It is
a new house built by Lord de Grey, without architects or any
professional aid, and a great work for an amateur to have
accomplished. Returned yesterday, and found London beginning
to fill for Parliament. Everybody asks his neighbour,
will the Government be able to go on&mdash;a question
which nobody pretends to answer on any good grounds of
probability. Electioneering casualties during the recess have
brought the two parties (supposing all the Whig alliance to
cohere) nearer to an equality than they were before, and they
are so bitter against each other, that the Tories will certainly
drive the Ministry out if they can, and take the chance
of being themselves able to govern. But with reference to
the state of public affairs and the composition of the
Government, the Ministry presents a much more respectable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
appearance than it has heretofore done; the Cabinet contains
men of character, of experience, and of great acquirements,
and Clarendon, who has just taken his seat among them and
has added to it a good diplomatic reputation, tells me that
they are not only very united, agreed in general principles,
and only differing to an extent that any thirteen men must
occasionally differ on particular points; but that they are as
Conservative a Cabinet as possible. And so, no doubt, they
are in their hearts and wishes, and so they would be, if the
Conservatives would allow them to keep their places, and
give them strength enough to maintain Conservative interests.
It is impossible to doubt that the best thing that
could happen in the present situation of the country would
be the continuance in office of the present Government, with
the consent and acquiescence of the Tories, so long as they
administered the government on just, moderate, and constitutional
principles, and with a full understanding that any
departure therefrom would be followed by their unrelenting
hostility. But this would require a large amount of
patriotism and self-denial from a great party, who, besides
a consciousness of strength, have their minds full of bitter
animosity, and an impatience for party victory, and the
acquisition of official power; and in their eager desire for
revenge and triumph, they overlook all considerations, and
are ready to incur any risk and take all consequences.</p>

<p>As far as the state of public affairs is concerned, Ministers
have not at all a bad case to bring before the country. The
great interests, on which the eyes of the world have been
fixed, are prosperous and ably administered. Ebrington in
Ireland, Auckland in India, and now Poulett Thomson in
Canada, have contributed in their different ways to the
favourable <i>exposé</i> of the Government, nor is there any point
on which they are particularly vulnerable, or any grave
reproach to which they have rendered themselves obnoxious.
But all this will not avail to make them strong, or render
their tenure of office secure and permanent. They are not
popular, all parties distrust them, none believe that they
have any fixed principles from which no considerations would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">OPENING OF PARLIAMENT.</span>
induce them to swerve, and the unfortunate circumstances
under which they so improperly took office again in March
last, and their apparent wavering between antagonist principles,
and readiness to yield to pressure when they could not
escape it, have given a worse opinion of their character than
they really deserve.</p>

<h3>January 17th, 1840</h3>

<p>Parliament met yesterday. The Queen
was well enough received&mdash;much better than usual&mdash;as she
went to the House. The Speech was harmless. Some had
wished to have something about the Corn Laws in it, but
this was overruled by the majority. They said nothing about
Prince Albert&rsquo;s Protestantism, and very properly, for though
they might as well have done so in the Speech to the Privy
Council (merely not to give a handle to their opponents for
cavilling and clamouring), it would have been an acknowledgement
of error, and a knocking under to clamour, to do
so now. The Duke, however, moved an amendment, and
foisted in the word Protestant,&mdash;a sop to the silly. I was
grieved to see him descend to such miserable humbug, and
was in hopes he was superior to it, and would have rather
put down the nonsense than have lent his sanction to it.
He is said to be very well, strong in body and clear in mind,
but I fully expect that he will give, in the course of this
Session, evident proofs of the falling-off of his mind.</p>

<p>In the House of Commons they are bent upon mischief,
and speedy mischief; for Sir J. Yarde Buller gave notice
directly of a motion of want of confidence, so that the
strength of the two parties will be tested forthwith. This
was a regular concerted party move, and took their opponents
completely by surprise. It proceeds from the boiling impatience
of the party, indoors and out. The Tory masses
complain that nothing is done; and so, to gratify them, an
immediate assault is resolved upon. Lord Wharncliffe said
to me yesterday morning that the real obstacle to the Tories
coming into office was the Queen. This was the only difficulty;
but her antipathy to Peel rendered him exceedingly
reluctant to take office, and there were many among the
party who felt scruples in forcing an obnoxious Ministry upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
her. This is, in fact, the real Tory principle, but I doubt
many of the Tories being influenced by it.</p>

<p>Bradshaw<a name="FNA_07_14" id="FNA_07_14"></a><a href="#FN_07_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
and Horsman went out yesterday morning.
The former called out the latter on account of a speech at
Cockermouth, in which, in allusion to the famous Canterbury
<i>Victorippick</i>, he had said that Bradshaw had the tongue of a
traitor and the heart of a coward. Though six weeks had
elapsed between the speech and the challenge, Horsman did
go out, and they exchanged shots; after which Bradshaw
made a sort of stingy apology for his insults to the Queen,
and the other an apology for his offensive expressions.
Gurwood went out with Bradshaw, which he had better not have
done.<a name="FNA_07_15" id="FNA_07_15"></a><a href="#FN_07_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
He said, &lsquo;he had never read Bradshaw&rsquo;s speech,
and was ignorant what he had said.&rsquo; As Gurwood is a man
of honour and veracity, this must be true; but it is passing
strange that he alone should not have read what everybody
else has been talking about for the last two months, and that
he should go out with a man as his second on account of
words spoken, and not enquire what they were.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_14" id="FN_07_14"></a><a href="#FNA_07_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a>
[Mr. Bradshaw had used very unbecoming and disloyal language in
speaking of the Queen at a public dinner or meeting at Canterbury some weeks
before. Mr. Horsman, a strong Whig, and Member for Cockermouth,
had censured Bradshaw for his disloyalty&mdash;hence this strange duel.]</p></div>

editor of his Despatches, had just been appointed to the Governorship of the
Tower.]</p></div>

<h3>January 18th, 1840</h3>

<p>Everybody talks of this duel, and the
Whigs abuse Gurwood, and accuse him of ingratitude, for
having acted for Bradshaw in such a quarrel, when he has
just been loaded with favours&mdash;a pension and a place; for,
though the latter was given by the Duke of Wellington, it
was with the concurrence of Government, who might either
have reduced his salary or taken away his pension, and did
neither. Gurwood has acquired a title to public gratitude
by being instrumental to the publication of the Wellington
Despatches; but he is a silly fellow; his conduct in this duel
shows it. He certainly ought to have declined to meddle;
but he told George Anson (who was Horsman&rsquo;s second) he
never did decline when asked; and he not only said he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">HORSMAN AND BRADSHAW DUEL.</span>
never read Bradshaw&rsquo;s speech, but when George Anson
offered to show it to him he refused to read it. I should
have declined discussing the matter with him unless he did
read it. Bradshaw behaved very well. After the shots,
Gurwood asked if Horsman would retract. Anson said,
&lsquo;No, not till Bradshaw did, or apologised.&rsquo; Gurwood then
said to Anson, &lsquo;Will you propose to him to do so? I cannot.&rsquo;
So he did. Bradshaw was deeply affected; owned he had
been miserable ever since; said he could not live without
honour, but would say anything that Anson and Gurwood
(and he felt his honour as safe with the former as the latter)
would agree that he could and ought to say; and George
Anson drew up his apology, and did not make it stronger,
because he would not press him hard. The fact is, he is
much indebted to Horsman for getting him out, in some
measure, of a very bad scrape.</p>

<p>The Queen has been attacked for going down in person
to Parliament, just after the news arriving of the Landgravine&rsquo;s
death; but she consulted her relations, the Princess
Augusta particularly, who advised her to go, said it was a
public duty, and that they had all been brought up in the
doctrine that the discharge of the duties of their station was
to supersede everything. So she went.</p>

<p>I met
Burge<a name="FNA_07_16" id="FNA_07_16"></a><a href="#FN_07_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
this morning, who is very much disgusted
at no mention being made of Jamaica in the Speech, and at
the speech of John Russell; who, in alluding to the omission,
spoke very disparagingly of the Assembly, or at least, what
will there appear so. But he admits, nevertheless, that Lord
John Russell is by far the best Secretary of State he ever
had to deal with, and that in his general conduct towards
the island they have ample cause for satisfaction.</p>

<h3>January 22nd, 1840</h3>

<p>Dined at Lady Blessington&rsquo;s the day
before yesterday: a queer <i>omnium gatherum</i> party&mdash;Prince
Louis Napoleon, General Montholon, Lord Lyndhurst,
Brougham, Sir Robert Wilson, Leader, and Roebuck. Droll
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
to see Lyndhurst, the most execrated of the Tories, hand-and-glove,
and cracking his jokes, with the two Radicals.
After dinner I had a talk with him. He said the Duke had
been all against the motion on the 28th, but that unless they
had agreed to it, the party would have been broken up; said
he did not care about coming in. If they did, a dissolution
would give them a majority of sixty, but that this would not
enable them to stand against the Queen&rsquo;s hostility and determination
to trip up their heels whenever she
could;<a name="FNA_07_17" id="FNA_07_17"></a><a href="#FN_07_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
that the Opposition would become more Radical, the Queen herself
Radical; they should be driven out, and the country
ruined. He thought the Duke strong in body and clear in
mind, but more excitable. I said I thought that to those
who knew him a change was perceptible; that it was impossible
to cite any particular thing in proof of it; but that
conversation with him left such an impression. Lyndhurst
replied that this was exactly his own opinion, but that the
Duke&rsquo;s authority with the party was undiminished, and indispensably
necessary to keep them together. The Tories
are very angry with Peel for taking such a strong part as he
has done on the Privilege question, which nothing but his
influence prevents their turning into a regular party debate.
The House has gone floundering on upon it, wasting a great
deal of time and ingenious speaking, and having got into a
difficulty from which there is no convenient extrication.</p>

first, for not themselves deciding the point that
was raised; next, for not asking the jury for the reasons of
their recommending the criminals to mercy; and the Chief
Justice&rsquo;s charge to the jury was thought a very weak and
poor performance.</p>

<span class="pagehead">THE PRIVILEGE QUESTION.</span>
beg I would suggest some Lord for the situation of Chief of
Prince Albert&rsquo;s establishment, for they can get none who is
eligible. They want a Peer, a Whig, and a man of good
sense, character and education, something rather better than
common, and such an one willing to put on Court trappings
they find not easily to be had. We made out a list, to be
shown to Melbourne, who had consulted the Duke of Bedford,
and asked him for a man. We talked over the bitter
hostility between the Queen and the Tories, and he said,
that Melbourne did everything he could to mitigate her feelings,
and to make her understand that she must not involve
the whole party in the reproach which justly attaches to a
few foolish or mischievous zealots, so much so that lately
when the Queen was inveighing against the Tories to somebody
(he would not say to whom), and complaining of their
behaviour to her, she added, &lsquo;It is very odd, but I cannot
get Lord Melbourne to see it in that light.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Privilege
question<a name="FNA_07_20" id="FNA_07_20"></a><a href="#FN_07_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
occupies everybody&rsquo;s
thoughts, and there is much interest and curiosity to
see the sequel of it. The state of the House of Commons
upon it is curious: all the Whigs for Privilege, and the chiefs
of the Tories with them; with some of the lawyers (except
Sugden) the same way; but Follett, who at first was heartily
with Peel, has latterly taken no part, though he has voted
with the majority. On the other side are the great bulk of
the Tories and all the second-rate lawyers&mdash;the only eminent
ones that way being Sugden, Pemberton, and Kelly. The
debates have elicited some admirable speeches on both sides,
of which Peel&rsquo;s three nights ago, when he explained the law
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
better than the lawyers could, has been the most remarkable.
The Tories are very angry with him for taking it up so
warmly, and they will not be the more pleased at the complimentary
speech of John Russell, in which he told him
that nothing but his taking the course he had done had
enabled the House to assert its privilege at all, as it could
not have been made a mere party question. The Government
are getting into better spirits about their prospects,
and so many of the Tories acknowledge that there would be
danger and difficulty in changes just now, that there will
probably be none. Mr. Walter was beaten hollow in Southwark
in spite of an Anti-Poor Law cry, by the help of which
his friends were very sanguine about his success.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_20" id="FN_07_20"></a><a href="#FNA_07_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a>
[The Privilege question arose out of a prosecution of Messrs. Hansard
by one Stockdale, for the publication of a libel on himself in the Parliamentary
Debates. Hansard pleaded the authority of Parliament, but the
Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench rejected the plea and gave judgement against
Hansard. The House of Commons, on the motion of Lord John Russell,
who was supported by Sir R. Peel, defended their printers, and committed
the Sheriffs of London for levying damages on Hansard. Peel afterwards
acknowledged that he had been misled by the advice of Sir F. Pollock and
had gone too far; in fact, it appears from the text that the weight of legal
authority was against him. The dispute was settled at last by legislation.
See <i>infra</i>, February 21st, 1840.]</p></div>

<h3>January 26th, 1840</h3>

<p>The Government are triumphant at all
their elections, and raised to the skies by their success, which
they construe into an indication of reaction in their favour.
It is certainly a great thing for them, for it produces a good
moral effect, besides the influence it will have on the division
next week, and it tends to show that if a dissolution were to
take place, the Conservatives would not be in so much better,
nor the Whigs in so much worse a position, as the former
have been for some time boasting of, and the latter apprehending.
Everybody (except those who have an interest
in defending it) thinks the allowance proposed for Prince
Albert very exorbitant: 50,000&#8467;. a year given for pocket
money is quite monstrous, and it would have been prudent
to propose a more moderate grant for the sake of his popularity.
Prince George of Denmark had 50,000&#8467;. a year (as
it is said), but the Queen gave it him, and he had a household
four times more numerous than is intended for Prince
Albert.</p>

<h3>January 29th, 1840</h3>

<p>On Monday night Government were
beaten by 104 on the question of reducing the Prince&rsquo;s allowance
from 50,000&#8467;. to 30,000&#8467;. a year. They knew they should
be beaten, but nevertheless John Russell would go doggedly
on and encounter this mortifying defeat, instead of giving
way with the best grace he could. He lost his temper, and
flung dirt at Peel, like a sulky boy flinging rotten eggs; in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">NATURALISATION OF PRINCE ALBERT.</span>
short, exposed himself sadly. His friends were much annoyed
that he did not give way, as soon as he found that
there was no chance of carrying it, and that many Government
supporters would vote against it; besides the mortification
to the Prince, there was something mean and sordid
in squabbling for all the money they could get, and the sum
given him is <i>satis superque</i> for all his wants.</p>

<p>In the Lords, they introduced the Naturalisation Bill in
such a slovenly and objectionable form, that the Duke desired
it might be put off, which (although he pledged and committed
himself in no manner) they immediately construed
into a resolution to oppose the Precedence part of it. The
Queen is bent upon giving him precedence of the whole
Royal Family. The Dukes of Sussex and Cambridge, who
each want some additions to their incomes, have signified
their consent; the King of Hanover (whom it does not immediately
concern) has refused his. On this they brought
in their Bill. Her Majesty was, however, more provoked at
what passed in the House of Lords, than at the defeat in the
Commons.</p>

<p>I asked Charles Gore why John Russell did not avail
himself of the momentary connexion he had with Peel on
the Privilege question, to ask him what his views were about
the allowance, and tell him that it was so desirable to avoid
any division on such a question that he wished to propose
nothing that was likely to be objected to. Gore said that
upon a former occasion, when Lord John had spoken in such
a spirit to Peel, he had been met by him in such an ungracious
manner that it was impossible for him ever to do so again.
This was about the Speakership, when he wrote a private
note to Peel, beginning &lsquo;My dear Sir,&rsquo; and asking him to tell
him what the intentions of his party were about opposing
the Government Speaker, because he was anxious if possible
not to bring people up to town without necessity; to which
he replied in the coldest and driest terms, &lsquo;Sir Robert Peel
presents his compliments to Lord John Russell,&rsquo; expressing
his surprise at his letter, saying he had no right to call upon
him for any explanation of his intentions, and refusing to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
give any information whatever. I do not think John Russell
had any right to make such a communication to him, and
it was, I fancy, very unusual, but Peel might as well have
answered it good-humouredly.</p>

<p>The judges have given their decision upon the two points
raised for the Newport
prisoners,<a name="FNA_07_21" id="FNA_07_21"></a><a href="#FN_07_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and their fate now rests
with the Government. They decided, by a majority of nine
to six, that the objection was valid, and by nine to six that
it was not taken in time. Upon such accidents do the lives
of men depend. It is well known that the law can have no
certainty, because so much must always be left to the discretion
of those who administer it; but such striking illustrations
of its uncertainty, and of the extent to which the
chapter of accidents is concerned in it, seldom occur, and
make one shudder when they
do.<a name="FNA_07_22" id="FNA_07_22"></a><a href="#FN_07_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
No doubt, however, is
cast over the guilt of the men, and the Government may
very properly leave them to their fate, if they are not afraid
of shocking public opinion by doing so. The world at large
does not distinguish accurately or reason justly, swallows
facts in gross, and jumps to conclusions. Many will say it
is hard to put men to death when the judges are nearly
equally divided on their case, the majority admitting that
the law would save them if it had been urged soon enough
in their favour. It rather seems to turn the tables on the
prosecution; and whereas the prisoners are availing themselves
of a mere quibble, of a technical objection, strained to
its extremest point, the effect may be that of exhibiting the
Government as availing itself of the technicality in point of
time to overthrow the more important legal objection. The
case appears to have been very ably argued, especially by
Kelly.</p>

[The ringleaders in the Newport riots were convicted and might have
been hanged; but two technical objections to the sentence having been
taken, though not allowed by the judges, the Government remitted the
capital sentence. They had a narrow escape.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_22" id="FN_07_22"></a><a href="#FNA_07_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a>
Parke said, that if the objection had been decided on the spot they
would have escaped, as he and Williams were for it, while the Chief Justice
was against it.</p></div>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE MONMOUTH CONVICTS.</span>
has now lasted two
nights,<a name="FNA_07_23" id="FNA_07_23"></a><a href="#FN_07_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
without being very
interesting. Sir George Grey made a brisk, dashing speech
quite at the beginning, which was very effective, but when
read, disappoints, as there does not seem a great deal in it.
Last night Macaulay failed. He delivered an essay, not
without merit, but inapplicable, and not the sort of thing
that is wanted in such a debate. He had said he should
not be of use to them, and he appears to have judged
correctly. The Tories affected to treat his speech with contempt,
and to talk and laugh, which was a rudeness worthy
of the noisy and ignorant knot that constitutes the tail of
that party. Howick attacked everybody all round, and
explained his own motive for leaving office, not alluding to
the Secretary of State&rsquo;s office; and Graham made one of his
usual speeches.</p>

[Sir John Yarde Buller moved a resolution that &lsquo;Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Government, as at present constituted, does not possess the confidence of

<h3>January 31st, 1840</h3>

<p>Macaulay&rsquo;s speech, which was said to be
a failure, reads better than Sir George Grey&rsquo;s, which met
with the greatest success&mdash;the one fell flat upon the audience,
while the other was singularly effective. So great is the
difference between good manner and bad, and between the
effect produced by a dashing, vivacious, light, and active
style, and a ponderous didactic eloquence, full of matter, but
not suited in arrangement or delivery, and in all its accessory
parts, to the taste of the House.</p>

<p>The question of sparing the lives of the Monmouth
prisoners or not is everywhere discussed, with an almost
general opinion that, under all the circumstances, the
Government cannot let the law take its course. It is impossible
for any reasoning to be more fallacious, because, if
pushed to its just conclusion, it must result that they ought
to escape altogether, which nobody expects or desires. The
case has been very curious from the beginning; and end
how it may, no criminals ever had so many chances afforded
them of escape; never were there nicer points for the decision
of different people or different stages of the business, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
more blunders committed by almost all concerned. In the
first place, Maule, the Crown solicitor, failed to comply with
the letter of the Act, and did not furnish the prisoners with
lists of the jury and the witnesses <i>at the same time</i> ten
days before the trial. He gave them one list ten days
before, and the other fifteen days before. The Attorney-General
was aware of the fact, and aware that a question
would arise upon it; the judges appointed to the special
Commission were apprised of it by their Associates, and they
communicated with each other upon it. They considered
whether they should convey the expression of their doubts
upon this point to the Government, so that the difficulty
might be rectified; but they agreed that their duty was to
try the cause, and not to interfere in any way whatever, and
they accordingly held their peace. It was in the power of
the Attorney-General to postpone the trial for ten days,
which would have removed every difficulty and objection,
but he was so certain that the objection could not be maintained,
that he would not do so, and chose to run the risk,
unwisely, as it has turned out. The trial came on, and the
counsel for the prisoners, instead of urging the objection <i>in
limine</i>, suffered them to plead; whereas, if they had refused
to plead, they would have escaped
altogether.<a name="FNA_07_24" id="FNA_07_24"></a><a href="#FN_07_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
The trial
proceeded; they were found guilty, and recommended to
mercy, but the Chief Justice never asked the jury upon what
grounds, leaving it doubtful whether the jury thought that
there were any extenuating circumstances, or whether they
were actuated by terror, or mere repugnance to the infliction
of capital punishment. It was probably the great importance
of the case, and the fact of the Chief of the Commission
being against the objection, which induced the other two
who were in its favour to agree to refer it to the other
judges; for if it had been settled on the spot the trials
would have ended at once. Moreover it was believed that
the judges thought very lightly of the objection, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE PRECEDENCE OF PRINCE ALBERT.</span>
Brougham told me they were <i>unanimous</i>, so ill-informed was
he of their real opinions.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_24" id="FN_07_24"></a><a href="#FNA_07_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a>
This is not so. If they had raised the objection before the prisoners
pleaded, the Attorney-General could have put the trial off, and of course if
the judges thought the objection valid, he would have done so.</p></div>

<p>Yesterday morning I met Lord FitzGerald, when we
walked together, and I begged him to find some expedient
for settling <i>à l&rsquo;amiable</i> the question of Precedence, so as to
pacify the Queen if possible, who was much excited about it.
He spoke very despondingly of the general state of affairs,
but said that he was as anxious as anybody to avoid unpleasant
discussions upon it, and to satisfy her if possible, but
that the House of Lords were running breast high upon it.
I begged him to see the Duke of Wellington, to tell him
what her feeling was, and entreat him to take measures to
settle it quietly. He said he would see him, and that he was
convinced if the Duke had his own way, he would be disposed
to do this; but that if it was left to Lyndhurst and
Ellenborough, it was impossible to answer for what they
might do. His own impression was, that they might and
ought to give him precedence for her life over the rest of the
Royal Family (though it was very awkward with regard to
the King of Hanover, when he refused his consent), but not
over a Prince of Wales, to which, he thought, they never
would consent. We talked the matter over in all its bearings,
and the result was, that he undertook to go to the
Duke and tell him what I had said. I had (not an hour ago)
a confirmation of what he said as to Ellenborough, for I met
him at his own door (next mine), when I said to him, &lsquo;What
are you going to do about the precedence?&rsquo; To which he said,
&lsquo;Oh, give him the same which Prince George of Denmark
had: place him next before the Archbishop of Canterbury.&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;That will by no means satisfy the Queen;&rsquo; at which
he tossed up his head, and said, &lsquo;What does that signify?&rsquo;</p>

<p>FitzGerald afterwards talked to me of Peel and his party,
of their violent language on account of his conduct in the
Privilege question, and of his annoyance at their separation
from him&mdash;not the lawyers, or those really competent to
form an opinion, but the great mass destitute of the knowledge
or understanding necessary to form an opinion&mdash;and
only opposing him because he supported John Russell.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Amongst other things, when we were talking of the event
of May last, and of the Queen&rsquo;s antipathy to Peel, he said
that it was altogether unaccountable, for even from his last
interview he had come away not dissatisfied with her manner,
and he owned that he had no doubt Melbourne did his best
honestly to drive out of her mind the prejudices which have so
great an influence upon her; and at that very crisis, he
told me as a proof of it, that at the ball at Court, Melbourne
went up to Peel and whispered to him with the greatest
earnestness, &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, go and speak to the Queen.&rsquo;
Peel did not go, but the entreaty and the refusal were both
characteristic. FitzGerald said, that nothing would induce
Peel to continue (after this fight) a worrying war with the
Government; and added, what is very true, that though a
weak Opposition was a very bad thing, there was no small
danger and difficulty in leading a strong one.</p>

<h3>February 4th, 1840</h3>

<p>After four nights&rsquo; debate and division, at
five in the morning, Government got a majority of twenty-one,
just what was (at last) expected. Peel spoke for three
hours, and so elaborately as to fatigue the House, so that
his speech probably seems much better to the reader than to
the hearer of it. The Opposition all along abstained from
attacking the Government upon their measures, and Peel
directed his artillery against their compromise of principle
in making Ballot an open question, and the general laxity of
their political morality. But the most important part of his
speech was his declaration of the principles by which he
meant to be governed in office or out; and his manly and
distinct announcement to his followers, that they must support
him on his own terms, and that if they did not like
them, he was sorry for it, and they might look elsewhere for
a leader if they chose it. There can be no doubt that it was
wise and bold thus to cast himself on public opinion, and to
put forth a manifesto, which leaves no doubt of his future
conduct, and from which there is no retreat for him, and by
which all his adherents must be equally bound. On the
other hand, Lord John, considering he rose at three in the
morning, when he and the House must have been pretty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ROYAL PRECEDENCE REFUSED.</span>
well exhausted, made a very good and honourable speech,
and ended with a declaration quite as Conservative as Peel&rsquo;s
was on the other hand Liberal, so much so that it is really
difficult to say what difference there now is between them,
nor does there appear any reason why (circumstances permitting)
they should not act together to-morrow. As far as
the two <i>parties</i> are concerned, taking debate and division,
perhaps no great advantage has been gained by either, but I
think the discussion has been beneficial by eliciting the above
declaration from the respective leaders.</p>

<p>The Precedence Question has fallen to the ground, and
is left unsettled, in a manner much to be regretted.  After
my interview with FitzGerald, I went to Clarendon and told
him what had passed. He went to the Cabinet, and prevailed
on Duncannon to speak to Melbourne and get him to
communicate with the Duke, for the purpose of settling the
question if possible amicably. Melbourne said he would,
but did not. On Friday the Cabinet agreed to give up the
precedence over the Prince of Wales; but to a question of
Brougham&rsquo;s the Chancellor said, he had no other concession
to offer. It was then agreed that the discussion should be
taken on Monday. On Saturday Clarendon spoke to Melbourne
himself, and urged him to consider seriously the inconvenience
of a battle on this point, and prevailed upon
him to go to the Duke of Wellington and talk it over with
him. He wrote to the Duke, who immediately agreed to
receive him; when he went to Apsley House, and they had an
hour&rsquo;s conversation. Melbourne found him with one of his
very stiffest crotchets in his head, determined only to give
the Prince precedence after the Royal Family; and all he
could get from him was, that it would be <i>unjust</i> to do more.
All argument was unavailing, and he left him on Saturday
evening without having been able to make any impression
on him, or to move him by a representation of the Queen&rsquo;s
feelings to make concessions to meet those the Government
were prepared to make; for the Queen would have been
content to accept precedence for her life, and saving the
rights of the Prince of Wales. This, however, they would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
not consent to; and so determined were they to carry their
point, that they made a grand whip up, and brought Lord
Clare all the way from Grimsthorpe, to vote upon it. Under
these circumstances the Government resolved to withdraw
the clause, and they did so, thus leaving the Prince without
any specific place assigned by Parliament, and it remains
with the Queen to do what she can for him, or for courtesy,
tacit consent, and deference for her Consort to give him the
precedence virtually which the House of Lords refuses to
bestow formally. I think the Duke has acted strangely in
this matter, and the Conservatives generally very unwisely.
<i>Volentibus non fit injuria</i>, and the Dukes of Sussex and
Cambridge, who alone were concerned, had consented to the
Prince&rsquo;s precedence. The King of Hanover, it seems, was
never applied to because they knew he would have refused;
and they did not deem his consent necessary. There is no
great sympathy for the lucky Coburgs in this country, but
there is still less for King Ernest, and it will have all the effect
of being a slight to the Queen out of a desire to gratify him.
There certainly was not room for much more dislike in her mind
of the Tories; but it was useless to give the Prince so ungracious
and uncordial a reception, and to render him as inimical
to them as she already is. As an abstract question, I think
his precedence unnecessary; but under all the circumstances
it would have been expedient and not at all unjust to grant it.</p>

<h3>February 13th, 1840</h3>

<p>The discussion about the Precedence
question induced me to look into the authorities and the
ancient practice, and to give the subject some consideration.
I came to the conclusion that she has the power to give him
precedence everywhere but in Parliament and in Council,
and on the whole that <i>her husband</i> ought to have precedence.
So I wrote a pamphlet upon it, setting forth the result of
my enquiry and my opinion. I have been in many minds
about publishing it, and I believe I shall, though it is certainly
not worth much.</p>

<p>The wedding on Monday went off tolerably
well.<a name="FNA_07_25" id="FNA_07_25"></a><a href="#FN_07_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE QUEEN&rsquo;S MARRIAGE.</span>
week before was fine, and Albert drove about the town with
a mob shouting at his heels. Tuesday, Wednesday, and
to-day, all beautiful days; but Monday, as if by a malignant
influence, was a dreadful day&mdash;torrents of rain, and violent
gusts of wind. Nevertheless a countless multitude thronged
the park, and was scattered over the town. I never beheld
such a congregation as there was, in spite of the weather.
The Queen proceeded in state from Buckingham House to
St. James&rsquo;s without any cheering, but then it was raining
enough to damp warmer loyalty than that of a London mob.
The procession in the Palace was pretty enough by all
accounts, and she went through the ceremony with much
grace and propriety, not without emotion, though sufficiently
subdued, and her manner to her family was very pretty
and becoming. Upon leaving the Palace for Windsor she
and her young husband were pretty well received; but
they went off in a very poor and shabby style. Instead of
the new chariot in which most married people are accustomed
to dash along, they were in one of the old travelling
coaches, the postilions in undress liveries, and with a
small escort, three other coaches with post-horses following.
The crowds on the road were so great that they did not reach
the Castle till eight o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<h3>February 15th (Saturday), 1840</h3>

<p>The Duke of Wellington had
a serious seizure on
Thursday.<a name="FNA_07_26" id="FNA_07_26"></a><a href="#FN_07_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
He dines early, and he rode
out after dinner. The first symptom of something wrong
was, that he could not make out the numbers on the doors
of the houses he wanted to call at. He went to Lady Burghersh,
and when he came away, the footman told his groom
he was sure his Grace was not well, and advised him to be
very attentive to him. Many people were struck with the
odd way he sat on his horse. As he went home this got more
apparent. When not far from Apsley House he dropped the
reins out of his left hand, but took them up with the other,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and when he got to his own door, he found he could not get
off his horse. He felt his hand chilled. This has been the
first symptom in each of his three attacks. He was helped
off. Hume was sent for, came directly, and got him to bed.
He had a succession of violent convulsions, was speechless,
and his arm was affected. They thought he would have died
in the night. The doctors came, physicked but did not
bleed him, and yesterday morning he was better. He has
continued to mend ever since, but it was a desperate blow,
and offers a sad prospect. He will probably again rally, but
these things must be always impending, and his mind must
be affected, and will be thought to be so. Lyndhurst asked
me last night what could be done. He said, &lsquo;The Duke
ought now to retire from public life, and not expose himself
to any appearance of an enfeebled understanding. Above
all things to be deprecated is, that he should ever become a
dotard like Marlborough, or a driveller like Swift.&rsquo; &lsquo;How,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;would Aberdeen do?&rsquo; He owned that nobody
could replace the Duke or keep the party in order, and he
said that the consequence would be it would break up, that
&lsquo;<i>there are many who would be glad of an opportunity to
leave it</i>.&rsquo; This I told him I did not believe, but it certainly
is impossible to calculate on the consequences of the Duke&rsquo;s
death, or, what is nearly the same thing, his withdrawal from
the lead of the party.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_26" id="FN_07_26"></a><a href="#FNA_07_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a>
[The Duke was seventy when he had this seizure, supposed at the time
to be fatal, at least to his faculties. But he lived for twelve years after it
and continued during the greater part of that time to render great public
services and to lead the Tory party.]</p></div>

<h3>February 16th, 1840</h3>

<p>The Duke of Wellington, although his
life was in such danger on Thursday night, that the chances
were he would die, has thrown off his attack in a marvellous
manner, and is now rapidly approaching to convalescence,
all dangerous symptoms subsiding. The doctors,
both Astley Cooper and Chambers, declare that they have
never seen such an extraordinary power of rallying in anybody
before in the whole course of their practice, and they
expect that he will be quite as well again as he was before.
It is remarkable that he has an accurate recollection of all
the steps of his illness from the first perception of uneasy
sensations to the moment of being seized with convulsions.
He first felt a chillness in his hand, and he was surprised to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PAMPHLET ON ROYAL PRECEDENCE.</span>
find himself passing and repassing Lady Burghersh&rsquo;s house
without knowing which it was. He called, however, and
went up; and to her enquiry&mdash;for she was struck with his
manner&mdash;he replied that he was quite well. Going home
he dropped the rein, but caught it up with the other hand.
When he arrived at his door, the servants saw he could not
get off his horse, and helped him, and one of them ran off
instantly for Hume. The Duke walked into his sitting-room,
where Hume found him groaning, and standing by the chimney-piece.
He got him to bed directly, and soon after the
convulsions came on.</p>

<p>I have sent forth my pamphlet, and there seems a chance
of its being read. Lord Melbourne said to me, &lsquo;What is to
be done about this Precedence?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I have told
you<a name="FNA_07_27" id="FNA_07_27"></a><a href="#FN_07_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
what I think is to be done. Have you sent my pamphlet to
the Queen?&rsquo; &lsquo;I have sent it her, and desired her to show it
to Prince Albert; and I have sent it to the Chancellor, and
desired him to give me his opinion on the law, as it requires
great consideration and great
care.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_07_28" id="FNA_07_28"></a><a href="#FN_07_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
I asked him, &lsquo;if he had
any doubt about the law, that is, about <i>my</i> law.&rsquo; He said,
&lsquo;he had doubts whether the Act of Henry VIII. was not
more stringent.&rsquo; I told him I had consulted Parke, Bosanquet,
and Erskine, that we had read the Act together, and
they were all clear that the Prerogative was not limited
except as to Parliament and the Council. At all events, I
said, he ought not to be made a Privy Councillor till after
this matter was settled, and to that he agreed; and it was
settled that he should not be sworn at the Council to-morrow.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
So thus it stands, and if the Chancellor sees no objection,
my plan will be adopted, and I shall have settled for them,
having no earthly thing to do with it, what they ought to
have settled for themselves long ago, and have avoided all
the squabbling and bad blood which have been the result of
their unlucky Bill. In the meantime the Duke read my
pamphlet yesterday, and to-day I went there to hear what
he said to it, and found that he agreed with me entirely,
and that he is all for the adoption of my suggestion. This
I forthwith despatched to Clarendon, who was gone to the
Levée, and desired him to tell Melbourne of it.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_27" id="FN_07_27"></a><a href="#FNA_07_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a>

people.</p></div>

[Mr. Greville contended in his pamphlet that the Act of Henry VIII.
for &lsquo;Placing the Lords&rsquo; applied only to their precedence in the House of
Lords and in the Privy Council, which being statutory could not be changed;
but that it was competent to the Crown to confer any precedence elsewhere.
Prince Albert was not a Peer, and he was not at this time a Privy Councillor;
therefore, the provisions of the statutes of Henry VIII. did not apply to
him. He was subsequently introduced into the Privy Council, where by
courtesy rank was given him next the Queen when no other member of the
Royal Family was present. As this pamphlet has some legal and historical
interest, it is reprinted in the Appendix to this volume.]</p></div>

<h3>February 21st, 1840</h3>

<p>On Thursday morning I got a note from
Arbuthnot, desiring I would call at Apsley House. When I
got there, he told me that the Duke of Cambridge had sent
for Lord Lyndhurst to consult him; that they were invited
to meet the Queen on Friday at the Queen Dowager&rsquo;s, and
he wanted to know what he was to do about giving precedence
to Prince Albert. Lord Lyndhurst came to Apsley
House and saw the Duke about it, and they agreed to report
to the Duke of Cambridge their joint opinion that the Queen
had an unquestionable right to give him any precedence she
pleased, and that he had better concede it without making
any difficulty. The Duke acquiesced, and accepted the invitation.
Melbourne told me the Queen was well satisfied
with my pamphlet, but &lsquo;she remarked that there was a very
high compliment to the Duke of Wellington at the end of
it.&rsquo; I asked if she had said it was a <i>just one</i>. He said,
&lsquo;No, she did not say that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I heard from Arbuthnot this morning that the Duke has
set his face resolutely against any Bill in the House of Lords
to settle the Privilege question; and that Lyndhurst, though
not so strong in his opinion as the Duke, is resolved to abide
by his determination, and to go with him. The Duke, in
fact, goes as far as any of the opponents of the Privilege, for
he not only thinks that the dicta of the Judges are not to be
questioned, but that the House of Commons ought not to
have the Privilege at all&mdash;that is, that their papers ought
not to be sold, and that they ought not to be circulated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BILL ON THE PRIVILEGE QUESTION.</span>
without anything being previously weeded out of them which
the law would consider libellous. This strong opinion of his
renders the question exceedingly difficult and embarrassing,
for it was become very clear that nothing but the intervention
of the House of Lords could untie so ravelled a knot.
All the Tories are in a state of mingled rage and despair at
the impetuosity with which Peel has plunged into this
matter, and at the irretrievable manner in which he has
identified himself with Lord John Russell upon it. Stanley
and Graham have always voted with him, but have never
once opened their lips, from which it is sufficiently clear that
they don&rsquo;t go nearly so far as he does, and now Graham is
acting as a sort of mediator and negotiator, to try and effect
some compromise or arrangement, but the case seems nearly
hopeless. Peel, on the other hand, is evidently as much
annoyed and provoked with his party as his party with him.
The other day, Arbuthnot, Peel, and Graham met at Apsley
House, and talked upon every subject, Arbuthnot told me,
but that of Privilege, on which none of them touched&mdash;a
pretty clear proof how tender the ground is become. The
Tory press has grown very violent, and treats Peel with no
more forbearance for his conduct on this question than the
Whig and Radical did John Russell for his speech about
Church rates; so rabid and unscrupulous are all Ultras of
whatever opinion. I told Melbourne how matters stood, at
which he seemed mightily disconcerted.</p>

<h3>February 25th, 1840</h3>

<p>Yesterday I saw the Duke of Wellington,
whom I had not seen for above six months, except for a
moment at the Council just after his first illness. He looked
better than I expected&mdash;very thin, and his clothes hanging
about him, but strong on his legs, and his head erect. The
great alteration I remarked was in his voice, which was
hollow, though loud, and his utterance, which, though not
indistinct, was very slow. He is certainly now only a ruin.
He is gone to receive the Judges at Strathfieldsaye, and he
will go on again when he comes back to town, and hold on
while he can. It is his desire to die with the harness on his
back, and he cannot endure the notion of retirement and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
care of his life, which is only valuable to him while he can
exert it in active pursuits. I doubt if he could live in
retirement and inactivity&mdash;the life of a valetudinarian.</p>

<p>Besides the Precedence question, another is now raised
about the Liturgy. The Queen wants to insert the Prince&rsquo;s
name in it; they sent to me to know if Prince George&rsquo;s (of
Denmark) had been inserted, and I found it had not. There
was a division of opinion, but the majority of the Cabinet
were disposed to put in Prince Albert&rsquo;s. Before deciding
anything they consulted the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Yesterday, however, on looking into the Act of Uniformity,
I satisfied myself that the Queen has not the power to insert
his name; and I believe that the insertion, on former occasions,
of Princesses of Wales was illegal, and could not have
been sustained if it ever had been questioned. This I imparted
to Lords Lansdowne and Clarendon, to deal with the
fact as they pleased; and I asked the opinions of Parke,
Bosanquet, and Lushington, who were sitting at the Judicial
Committee, and they all agreed that she had not the power,
under the 25th sec. of the Act of Uniformity.</p>

<h3>March 5th, 1840</h3>

<p>The Duke of Wellington returned to town;
went up with the Oxford address, and dines at the Palace on
Monday. So he is again in harness; but he is a broken
man, and I fear we shall see him show himself in eclipse,
which will be a sorry sight. He has consented to waive his
objections to the settlement by Bill of the Privilege question,
so it probably will be settled; and high time it is that
it should be. It is curious to see how little interest the
public takes in it, not caring a straw for the House of
Commons, or the sheriffs, and regarding the squabble with
extreme apathy. There has been a great delay in getting
ready the patent of precedence for Prince Albert, because
the law officers can&rsquo;t make up their minds as to the terms of
it, and whether exceptional words should be introduced or
not. My pamphlet has succeeded far beyond my hopes or
expectations, and got me many compliments, which I never
looked for from such a trifle. Peel said civil things to
FitzGerald about it; only the Royal Family and the Cambridges

<span class="pagehead">JUDICIAL COMMITTEE BILL.</span>
don&rsquo;t like it, on account of my having explained
the status of Prince George (of Cambridge); and they
fancy, in the event of his going to Germany, it might be
injurious to him, which seems very fanciful; but their pride
is hurt.</p>

<h3>March 6th, 1840</h3>

<p>The Chancellor spoke to me at the Council
on Thursday about his Judicial
Committee<a name="FNA_07_29" id="FNA_07_29"></a><a href="#FN_07_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Amendment Bill, and begged to have any information about practice,
and any suggestions, I could give him. Some of the provisions
of his Bill appeared objectionable, and I consulted
Dr. Lushington about it. He agreed, particularly as to the
plan of making the Master of the Rolls (as Vice-President)
the organ of the court, and making it imperative on him to
give judgement in all cases. Yesterday I went to the Chancellor
and told him the objections to which I thought his
plan was liable, which he received very candidly and thankfully,
and seemed only anxious to hear and consider anything
that could be suggested. He is very different from
Brougham, who, when he framed the original Bill, was
full of tricks and mystery, and tried to make a job of it
and create patronage for himself, besides being very obstinate
about the details which were then objected to. The
Chancellor said he would send me the Bill, which he
wished me to examine, and return with any observations
I thought fit.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_29" id="FN_07_29"></a><a href="#FNA_07_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a>
[This Bill with reference to the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council did not pass. It would have made the Master of the Rolls head of
the Court, and its chief organ.]</p></div>

<p>Prince Albert was gazetted last night. His precedence
is not fixed by patent under the Great Seal, but by Warrant
(I suppose, under the Sign Manual).</p>

<p>Copleston has got 1,000&#8467;. for the little volume of Dudley&rsquo;s
letters<a name="FNA_07_30" id="FNA_07_30"></a><a href="#FN_07_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
which he has just published. They are
very well in their way&mdash;clever, neatly written, not very
amusing, rather artificial, such as everybody reads because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
they were Dudley&rsquo;s, but which nobody would think worth
reading if they were anonymous. A mighty proof of the value
of a name.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_07_30" id="FN_07_30"></a><a href="#FNA_07_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a>
[Copleston, Bishop of Llandaff and Dean of St. Paul&rsquo;s, was an intimate
friend of the late Lord Dudley, and published part of their correspondence;
but the executors of Lord Dudley, who were the Bishop of Exeter and Lord
Hatherton, caused part of it to be suppressed.]</p></div>

<h3>March 12th, 1840</h3>

<p>The Chancellor sent me his Bill, after which
I called on him, and told him all my objections, and made
several suggestions, which he received very well, and begged
me to put in writing what I had said to him. This I did,
and sent the paper to him, which he said he would send to
Lushington, whom I had begged him to consult. I met
Lyndhurst at Lady Glengall&rsquo;s, and had some talk with him
about it, and found he agreed pretty well with me, and that
he is strongly in favour of appointing a permanent Chief of
our court, for <i>ministerial</i> purposes. The Chancellor has
himself been very unwillingly compelled to propose this
scheme of reform, for he hates all alterations, and does not
like to begin cleansing the Augean stable of the Court of
Chancery.</p>

<p>When I was with the Chancellor the other day, he said
a difficulty had been started about making Prince Albert a
Privy Councillor before he was of age, and asked me if there
was anything in it. I found, on looking into the books, that
the Royal Dukes had not been brought into Council till they
were of age, but probably that was because they could not
take their seats in the House of Lords before; but I also
found very clear proofs that George III.&rsquo;s sons had not been
sworn but <i>introduced</i> in his reign, and this puzzled me, for I
remembered to have sworn several of them at different times,
during the present and two last reigns. I therefore wrote
to the Duke of Sussex, and asked him what had occurred in
his case. His reply cleared the matter up. He said the
King&rsquo;s sons are <i>born</i> Privy Councillors, and that they are
declared sworn by the King whenever he pleases; that accordingly
he was merely introduced into Council in 1807;
but after the death of George III., when he stood in a
different relation to the reigning Sovereign, he was sworn;
and again at the accessions of King William IV. and
Queen Victoria. I found an account in the Council Books
of the form with which the Prince of Wales was introduced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CREEVEY&rsquo;S JOURNAL.</span>
into Council in 1784, and this I sent to Melbourne to show
to the Queen, suggesting that Prince Albert should be introduced
upon the same terms as Prince George of Denmark
had been, and with the same ceremonies as the Prince of
Wales in 1784.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington has reappeared in the House of
Lords, goes about, and works as usual, but everybody is
shocked and grieved at his appearance. Lyndhurst expressed
his alarm to me, lest he should go on until it became <i>desirable</i>
that he should retire, and his regret that his friends
could not prevail upon him to do so while he still can with
dignity. He dined at the Palace on Monday, and was
treated with the greatest civility by the Queen. Indeed,
she has endeavoured to repair her former coldness by every
sort of attention and graciousness, to which he is by no
means insensible.</p>

<p>Her Majesty went last night to the Ancient Concert
(which she particularly dislikes), so I got Melbourne to dine
with me, and he stayed talking till twelve o&rsquo;clock. He told
us, among other things, that he had seen Dudley&rsquo;s Diary
(now said to be destroyed), which contained very little that
was interesting upon public matters, but the most ample and
detailed disclosures about women in society, with their names
at full length. Melbourne expressed his surprise that anybody
should write a journal, and said that he had never
written anything, except for a short time when he was very
young, and that he had soon put in the fire all that he had
written. He talked of Creevey&rsquo;s Journal, and of that which
Dover is supposed to have left behind him; both of whom, at
different times and in different ways, knew a good deal of
what was going on. Melbourne said Creevey had been very
shrewd, but exceedingly bitter and malignant; and I was
rather surprised to hear him talk of Lord Dover as having been
very bitter also, an underhand dealer and restless intriguer.
I knew very well that he had ambition and vanity, which
were constantly urging him to play a part more than commensurate
with his capacity, and that he delighted in that
sort of political <i>commérage</i> which gave him importance (and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
this was the great cause of his friendship with Brougham,
who was just the man for him, and he for Brougham), but I
did not think it was his nature to be bitter, or that he ever
intended to be mischievous&mdash;only busy and bustling, within
the bounds of honour and fairness.</p>

<h3>March 13th, 1840</h3>

<p>I met Jérome Bonaparte yesterday at
dinner at Lady Blessington&rsquo;s, Count de Montfort, as he is
called. He is a polite, urbane gentleman, not giving himself
any airs, and said nothing royal except that he was going to
Stuttgard, &lsquo;pour passer quelques jours avec mon beau-frère
le Roi de Würtemberg.&rsquo; But these brothers of Napoleon
were nothing remarkable in their palmy days, and one&rsquo;s
sympathies are not much excited for them now. They rose
and fell with him, and, besides their brief enjoyment of a
wonderful prosperity, they have retired upon far better conditions
than they were born to. They are free and rich, and
are treated with no inconsiderable respect.</p>

<h3>March 14th, 1840</h3>

<p>Went to the House of Lords, and saw the
Chancellor, who told me he had forwarded the paper I sent
him to Dr. Lushington, who concurred in my suggestions,
and he had ordered the Privy Council Bill to be altered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
accordingly. Fell in with the Duke of Wellington, who took
my arm, told his cabriolet to follow, and walked the whole
way back to Apsley House, quite firm and strong. He looks
very old and worn, and speaks very slowly, but quite distinctly;
talked about the China question and other things,
and seemed clear enough. He was pleased with his reception
at Court, and told me particularly how civil Prince
Albert had been to him, and indeed to everybody else; said
he never saw better manners, or anybody more generally
attentive. The Duchess of Kent talked to him, and in
a strain of satisfaction, so that there is something like
sunshine in the Palace just now.</p>

<h3>March 18th, 1840</h3>

<p>The first symptom of a failure in the Duke
of Wellington&rsquo;s memory came under my notice the day
before yesterday. I had been employed by Gurwood to
negotiate with Dr. Lushington about some papers written
by the Duke when in Spain, which had fallen into the
Doctor&rsquo;s hands, and I spoke twice to the Duke on the subject,
the last time on Friday last, when I walked home with
him from the House of Lords. It was settled that the
Doctor should write to the Duke about them, who was to
write an answer, after which they were to be given up.
But when the Doctor&rsquo;s letter arrived, the Duke had forgotten
the whole thing, and could not remember what
Lushington it was, and actually wrote a reply (which was
not sent, because my brother set him right) to Stephen
Lushington, the ex-Secretary to the Treasury. This is so
remarkable in a man so accurate, and whose memory is
generally so retentive, that I can&rsquo;t help noticing it, as the
first clear and undoubted proof of his failure in a particular
faculty.</p>

<p>I dined yesterday at Devonshire House, a dinner of forty
people to feast the Royalties of Sussex and Capua with their
quasi-Consorts, for I know not whether the Princess of
Capua is according to Neapolitan law a real Princess any
more than our Cecilia is a real
Duchess,<a name="FNA_08_01" id="FNA_08_01"></a><a href="#FN_08_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
which she certainly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DINNER AT DEVONSHIRE HOUSE.</span>
is not, nor takes the title, though every now and then somebody
gives it her. However, there they were yesterday in
full possession of all the dignities of their husbands. The
Duke made a mystery of the order in which he meant them
to go out to dinner, and would let nobody know how it was
all to be till the moment came. He then made the Duke of
Sussex go out first with the Princess of Capua, next the
Prince with Lady Cecilia, and he himself followed with the
Duchess of Somerset, and so on. After dinner the Duke of
Sussex discoursed to me about the oath and other matters.
He is dissatisfied on account of the banners of the Knights
of the Garter having been moved in St. George&rsquo;s Chapel, to
make room for Prince Albert&rsquo;s, I suppose; but I could not
quite make out what it was he complained of, only he said
when such a disposition had been shown in all quarters
to meet Her Majesty&rsquo;s wishes, and render to the Prince all
honour, they ought not to push matters farther than they
can properly do, &amp;c. ... something to this effect. He is
not altogether pleased with the Court; that is evident.</p>

not according to the provisions of the Royal Marriage Act. But the marriage
was recognised, and his lady was shortly afterwards created by the Queen
Duchess of Inverness.]</p></div>

<h3>March 26th, 1840</h3>

<p>Ministers were defeated by sixteen on
Stanley&rsquo;s motion about Irish
Registration.<a name="FNA_08_02" id="FNA_08_02"></a><a href="#FN_08_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
O&rsquo;Connell made
a most blackguard speech, alluding with wretched ribaldry to
the deathbed of Stanley&rsquo;s mother-in-law, from which he had
come to urge his motion, out of deference to those whom he
had brought up for it. One of the worst of those disgraceful
and stupid brutalities, which will obliterate (if possible) the
fame of the great things O&rsquo;Connell has done in the course of
his career. What will Government do upon this? It is
impossible for anything to be more embarrassing. It is
humiliating to go on, after another great defeat, and it
is a bad question for them to dissolve upon. Weak in itself,
and with all the moral deformity of its O&rsquo;Connellism, it will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
produce no sympathy in this country, and not even a cry to
stand upon at a general election.</p>

[Lord Stanley&rsquo;s Irish Registration Bill, providing for an annual revision
of the lists by revising barristers, was carried against the Government
by 250 to 234 votes. The Bill made considerable progress, and was warmly
supported by the Opposition, but eventually Lord Stanley saw reason to
abandon it. See <i>infra</i>, August 13, 1840.]</p></div>

<h3>March 29th, 1840</h3>

<p>They did not care about this division, but
made very light of it. However, it adds an item to the
account against them, and is (say what they will) a bad
thing. It is bad too, to establish as a principle that no
defeats, nor any number of them, signify, as long as they are
not upon vital questions; it produces not only a laxity of
opinion and feeling upon public matters, but an indifference
and <i>insouciance</i> on the part of their supporters, which may
some day prove very mischievous; for if they once are permitted
to assume that defeats do not signify, they will not
be at the trouble of attending when inconvenient, nor will
they encounter unpopularity for the sake of Government,
and they will very soon begin to judge for themselves, or to
mistake what are and what are not vital questions. Upon
this occasion, Lord Charles Russell went away the morning
of the division without a pair.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at dinner at Normanby&rsquo;s, I met Lord
Duncannon,<a name="FNA_08_03" id="FNA_08_03"></a><a href="#FN_08_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
who showed me the correspondence between him and
the King of Hanover about the apartments at St. James&rsquo;s.
The case is this: When the Queen was going to be married,
the Duchess of Kent told Duncannon that she must have a
house,<a name="FNA_08_04" id="FNA_08_04"></a><a href="#FN_08_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and that she could not afford to pay for one (the
greater part of her income being appropriated to the payment
of her debts). Duncannon told her that there were no
royal apartments unoccupied, except the King of Hanover&rsquo;s
at St. James&rsquo;s; and it was settled that he should be apprised
that the Queen had occasion for them, and be requested to
give them up. Duncannon accordingly wrote a note to Sir
F. Watson, who manages the King&rsquo;s affairs here, and told
him that he had such a communication to make to his
Majesty, which he was desirous of bringing before him in
the most respectful manner, and that the arrangement
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING OF HANOVER&rsquo;S APARTMENTS.</span>
should be made in whatever way would be most convenient
to him. Watson informed him that he had forwarded his
note to the King, and shortly after Duncannon received an
answer from the King himself, which was neither more nor
less than a flat refusal to give up the apartments. Another
communication then took place between Duncannon and
Watson, when the latter said that it would be very inconvenient
to the King to remove his things from the apartments
without coming over in person, as the library particularly
was full of papers of importance. Duncannon then
proposed that the library and the adjoining room, in which
it was said that his papers were deposited, should not be
touched, but remain in his possession; that they should be
walled off and separated from the rest of the suite, which
might be given up to the Duchess for her occupation. This
proposal was sent to the King, who refused to agree to it, or
to give up the apartments at all. Accordingly the Queen
was obliged to hire a house for her mother at a rent of
2,000&#8467;. a year. I told Duncannon that they were all very
much to blame for submitting to the domineering insolence
of the King, and that when they thought it right to require
the apartments, they ought to have gone through with it,
and have taken no denial. It was a gross insult to the
Queen to refuse to give up to her an apartment in her own
palace, which she desired to dispose of; and they were very
wrong in permitting such an affront to be offered to her.
So Duncannon was himself of opinion; but Melbourne, who
is all for quietness, would not allow matters to proceed to
extremities, and preferred knocking under&mdash;a mode of proceeding
which is always as contemptible as it is useless.
The first thing is to be in the right, to do nothing unbecoming
or unjust, but with right and propriety clearly on
your side, to be as firm as a rock, and, above all things,
never to succumb to insolence and presumption.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_08_03" id="FN_08_03"></a><a href="#FNA_08_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>

<p>We had M. Guizot at
dinner.<a name="FNA_08_05" id="FNA_08_05"></a><a href="#FN_08_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
They all say he is agreeable,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
but I have not been in the way of his talk. He is
enchanted and elated with his position, and it is amusing to
see his apprehension lest anybody should, either by design or
inadvertence, rob him of his precedence; and the alacrity
with which he seizes on the arm of the lady of the house on
going out to dinner, so demonstrative of the uneasy grandeur
of a man who has not yet learnt to be familiar with his own
position. With reference to diplomatic rank, I only heard
last night, for the first time, that the Duke of Sutherland
had, some time ago, addressed a formal remonstrance to
Palmerston, against Foreign Ministers (not Ambassadors)
having place given them at the Palace (which means going
first out to dinner over himself <i>et suos pares</i>), a most extraordinary
thing for a sensible man to have done, especially in
such high favour as his wife and her whole family are. He
got for answer, that Her Majesty exercised her own pleasure
in this respect in her own palace. The rule always has been
that Ambassadors (who represent the persons of their Sovereigns)
have precedence of everybody; Ministers (who are
only agents) have not; but the Queen, it appears, has given
the <i>pas</i> to Ministers Plenipotentiaries, as well as to Ambassadors,
and ordered them to go out at her dinners before
her own subjects of the highest
rank.<a name="FNA_08_06" id="FNA_08_06"></a><a href="#FN_08_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<h3>April 3rd, 1840</h3>

<p>They have made Lady Cecilia Underwood a
duchess. Everybody considers it a very ridiculous affair, but
she and the Duke are, or affect to be, enchanted, though
nobody can tell why. She is Duchess of Inverness, though
there would have been more meaning in her being Countess
of Inverness, since Earl of Inverness is his second title.
However, there she was last night at the ball at Lansdowne
House, tucked under the Duke&rsquo;s arm, all smiles, and shaking
hands vehemently in all directions in acknowledgement of
congratulations. I was curious (as others were) to see what
it would all come to, and what, in fact, she was to take (in
the way of royalty) by her motion, and, as I thought, this
was just nothing. The Queen sat at the end of the room,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WAR WITH CHINA.</span>
with the Duchess of Cambridge on one side of her, and a
chair (for Prince Albert) on the other. The Duke of Sussex
took the Duchess of Inverness half way up the room, deposited
her amidst a cluster of people, and then went alone
to pay his respects to the Queen. Lady Lansdowne wrote
to the Queen to ask her pleasure whether the Duchess of
Inverness should be asked to sup at her table. Her Majesty
replied that she could not object to the Duchess of Inverness
supping there, provided care was taken that she did not go
out or take place before any other duchess. I saw Prince
Albert for the first time. He is exactly like the drawing
of him: a handsome face without much expression; but
without speaking to him and hearing him speak, it is difficult
to judge of his looks. Everybody speaks well of him.</p>

<h3>April 13th, 1840</h3>

<p>The China debate<a name="FNA_08_07" id="FNA_08_07"></a><a href="#FN_08_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
went off on the whole
well enough for the Government, though they only got a
majority of ten, owing in great measure to the number of
casualties on their side. Poyntz died the night before the
division, and the breath was hardly out of his body before
an express was despatched by the Tory whipper-in, to desire
that nobody would on any account pair with Captain Spencer
(his son-in-law). In this nice balance of parties, human life
seemed only to be of interest as votes are influenced by it.
Macaulay recovered his reputation on this occasion, and
made a good speech. Palmerston closed the debate with
a capital speech, but neither side appears to me to have
really hit the right nail on the head, or to have worked out
the strong parts of the case. Follett did more than anybody.
Thesiger made his first appearance, but not with any great
success. We had on the Friday a Council for the Order to
seize Chinese ships, &amp;c., and on the Saturday another for
completing the forms. There was a considerable discussion
as to whether the Order (being of a warlike nature) should be
signed by the Privy Councillors, and there was no case <i>exactly</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
in point. However, they decided, after much enquiry and
examination into precedent, that it should not

<p>Just after I got back to Newmarket, the intelligence
arrived of the extraordinary murder of Lord William Russell,
which has excited a prodigious interest, and frightened all
London out of its wits. Visionary servants and air-drawn
razors or carving-knives dance before everybody&rsquo;s imagination,
and half the world go to sleep expecting to have their
throats cut before morning. The circumstances of the case
are certainly most extraordinary, and though every day produces
some fresh cause for suspecting the man Courvoisier,
both the fact and the motives are still enveloped in great
mystery. People are always ready to jump to a conclusion,
and having made up their minds, as most have, that he must
have done the deed, they would willingly hang him up at
once. I had the curiosity to go the day before yesterday to
Tothill Fields Prison to see the man, who had just been sent
there. He is rather ill-looking, a baddish countenance, but
his manner was calm though dejected, and he was civil and
respectful, and not sulky. The people there said he was
very restless, and had not slept, and that he was a man of
great bodily strength. I did not converse with him.</p>

<h3>May 17th, 1840</h3>

<p>Just after writing the above, I went to the
house in Norfolk Street, to look at the premises, and the
places where the watch and other things were found hidden.
It was impossible not to be morally convinced that the
house had not been broken into, that the indications of
such violence were fabricated, and that the goods must have
been secreted by Courvoisier, consequently, that by him the
murder was committed; but there is as yet no evidence to
convict him of the actual commission of the deed, and though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">NARROW ESCAPE OF A CULPRIT.</span>
I believe him to be guilty, I could not, on such a case as
there is as yet, find him so if placed on a jury. I am very
sceptical about evidence, and know how strangely circumstances
sometimes combine to produce appearances of guilt
where there may be none. There is a curious case of this
mentioned in Romilly&rsquo;s Memoirs, of a man hanged for mutiny
upon the evidence of a witness who swore to his person, and
upon his own confession after conviction, and yet it was satisfactorily
proved afterwards that he had been mistaken for
another man, and was really innocent. He had been induced
to confess at the instigation of a fellow-prisoner, who told
him it was his best chance of escaping.</p>

<p>Lord Ashburton, when we were talking of this, told me
an anecdote of General Maitland (Sir Thomas), which happened
at some place in the West Indies or South America.
He had taken some town, and the soldiers were restrained
from committing violence on the inhabitants, when a shot
was fired from a window, and one of his men killed. They
entered the house, went to the room from the window of
which the shot had been fired, and found a number of men
playing at billiards. They insisted on the culprit being given
up, when a man was pointed out as the one who had fired
the shot. They all agreed as to the culprit, and he was carried
off. Sir Thomas considering that a severe example was
necessary, ordered the man to be tied to the mouth of a
cannon, and shot away. He was present, but turned his head
away when the signal was given for blowing this wretch&rsquo;s
body to atoms. The explosion took place, when to his
amazement the man appeared alive, but with his hair literally
standing &lsquo;like quills upon the fretful porcupine,&rsquo; with
terror. In the agony of the moment he had contrived to
squeeze himself through the ropes, which were loosely tied,
and get on one side of the cannon&rsquo;s mouth, so that the ball
missed him. He approached Maitland and said, &lsquo;You see,
General, that it was the will of Heaven my life should be
spared; and I solemnly assure you that I am innocent.&rsquo;
Maitland would not allow him to be executed after this
miraculous escape, and it turned out, upon further enquiry,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
that he <i>was</i> innocent, and it was some other man who had
fired the shot.</p>

<p>For the last month there has been something like a
cessation of political warfare, not from any diminished desire
on the part of the Opposition to harass the Government, but
from want of means to do so. In the House of Lords the
other night, Lord Stanhope brought on the China Question;
when the Duke of Wellington got up, and to the delight of
the Government, and the dismay and vexation of the Tories,
threw over Stanhope (in a very good speech), asserted the
justice of our quarrel with China, refused to discuss the question
of policy at all, warmly defended and eulogised Elliot,
moved the previous question, and then quitted the House,
without waiting to hear Stanhope&rsquo;s reply. It was gratifying
to see his energy and vigour, and to see them exerted on one
of those occasions when his great mind and patriotic spirit
never fail to show themselves. Whenever a question has, in
his view, assumed a national character, he scatters to the
wind all party considerations; such he now considers the
Chinese war to be. We are involved with China, nation
against nation, and he will not by word or deed put in
jeopardy the smallest of the mighty interests at stake, for
the sake of advancing some party purpose, and damaging
the Government. In like manner, he thinks that Elliot has
bravely, faithfully, and to the best of his ability, done his
duty; that if he has committed errors of judgement they
should be overlooked, and that he should be supported, encouraged,
and defended. This is the real greatness which
raises him so far above all the ordinary politicians of his day,
and which will confer on his memory imperishable renown.
It is rendered the more striking by his conduct on Friday
on the Irish Municipal Bill, which is a mere party question,
where he showed that he could be as violent as any Tory
could desire. I called on
Barnes<a name="FNA_08_09" id="FNA_08_09"></a><a href="#FN_08_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
on Saturday, and found
him much disgusted at the Duke&rsquo;s China speech, and anxious
to know how it could have happened. When I told him
that it was always so with him, and that he never would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DUKE OF WELLINGTON SUPPORTS GOVERNMENT.</span>
merely factious, Barnes said (which, is true enough) that it
is extraordinary, if he had intended to adopt such a tone in
the House of Lords, that he should have allowed Graham to
bring forward his motion in the House of Commons, and it
certainly does place Graham in a mortifying position, for the
Duke&rsquo;s speech is a complete answer to Graham&rsquo;s motion.</p>

<h3>May 26th, 1840</h3>

<p>At Newmarket last week. While there the
debate took place on the Registration Bill, carried by a majority
of only three, by the defection of Howick and Charles
Wood, which was caused, as is said, entirely by the influence
of Lord Grey, who is always out of humour with the Government,
glad to give them a knock, though ostensibly their
friend. However this may be, there was nothing inconsistent
in their conduct, and Wood accounted for his vote
very fairly. The Tories were triumphant for a moment, but
these defeats are now so common and so unproductive of any
consequences, that after the first shouting was over nobody
seemed to attach much importance to it. The Cambridge
and Ludlow elections having gone against them is of greater
consequence, because they show that the tide is running that
way, and that a dissolution must in all probability be ruinous
to them. The Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s budget seems
to have been very successful, and all agree that he did his
part exceedingly well.</p>

<p>Yesterday I met the Duke of Wellington. He was walking
in the garden of the park adjoining his own, promenading
two young ladies&mdash;Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s daughters&mdash;arm
in arm. He left them and took me to walk with him to
Lansdowne House. He began discoursing about the state of
affairs, and lamenting that there was, and could be, no
strong Government, and that there never would be till
people were convinced by experience of the necessity of
having one. He then said, &lsquo;If other people would do as I
do, support the Government when they can, and when the
Government ought to be supported, it would be much better.&rsquo;
I said I agreed with him, and that it had given me the
greatest pleasure to read his speech on China. He said,
&lsquo;All I know is, that it is absolutely necessary that question
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
should be settled, and the justice of our cause be made
manifest.&rsquo; I said, I was sure it was what he would feel, and
that he had done just what I expected, but that he must
be aware there were many of his own people who were by
no means so well pleased, but, on the contrary, to the last
degree annoyed and provoked at his speech. He replied, &lsquo;I
know that well enough, and I don&rsquo;t care <i>one damn</i>. I was
afraid Lord Stanhope would have a majority, and <i>I have not
time not to do what is right</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>June 12th, 1840</h3>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, as the Queen and
Prince Albert were driving in a low carriage up Constitution
Hill, about four or five in the afternoon, they were shot
at by a lad of eighteen years old, who fired two pistols at
them successively, neither shots taking effect. He was in
the Green Park without the rails, and as he was only a
few yards from the carriage, and, moreover, very cool and
collected, it is marvellous he should have missed his aim.
In a few moments the young man was seized, without any
attempt on his part to escape or to deny the deed, and was
carried off to prison. The Queen, who appeared perfectly
cool, and not the least alarmed, instantly drove to the
Duchess of Kent&rsquo;s, to anticipate any report that might reach
her mother, and, having done so, she continued her drive
and went to the Park. By this time the attempt upon her
life had become generally known, and she was received with
the utmost enthusiasm by the immense crowd that was
congregated in carriages, on horseback, and on foot. All
the equestrians formed themselves into an escort, and attended
her back to the Palace, cheering vehemently, while
she acknowledged, with great appearance of feeling, these
loyal manifestations. She behaved on this occasion with
perfect courage and self-possession, and exceeding propriety;
and the assembled multitude, being a high-class mob, evinced
a lively and spontaneous feeling for her&mdash;a depth of interest
which, however natural under such circumstances, must be
very gratifying to her, and was satisfactory to witness.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning the culprit was brought to the Home
Office, when Normanby examined him, and a Council was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE QUEEN SHOT AT.</span>
summoned for a more personal examination at two o&rsquo;clock.
A question then arose as to the nature of the proceeding,
and the conduct of the examination, whether it should be
before the Privy Council or the Secretary of State. We
searched for precedents, and the result was this: The three
last cases of high treason were those of Margaret Nicholson,
in 1786; of Hatfield, in 1800 (both for attempts on the life
of the Sovereign); and of Watson (the Cato Street affair),
for an attempt on the Ministers in 1820. Margaret Nicholson
was brought before the Privy Council, and the whole
proceeding was set forth at great length in the Council
Register. There appeared no entry of any sort or kind in
the case of Hatfield; and in that of Watson there was a
minute in the Home Office, setting forth that the examination
had taken place <i>there</i> by Lord Sidmouth, assisted by
certain Lords and others of the Privy Council. There was,
therefore, no uniform course of precedents, and Ministers had
to determine whether the culprit should be brought before
the Privy Council, or whether he should be examined by the
Cabinet only&mdash;that is, by Normanby as Secretary of State,
assisted by his colleagues, as had been done in Watson&rsquo;s
case. After some discussion, they determined that the examination
should be before the Cabinet only, and consequently
I was not present at it, much to my disappointment,
as I wished to hear what passed, and see the manner and
bearing of the perpetrator of so strange and unaccountable
an act. Up to the present time there is no appearance of
insanity in the youth&rsquo;s behaviour, and he is said to have
conducted himself during the examination with acuteness,
and cross-examined the witnesses (a good many of whom
were produced) with some talent. All this, however, is not
incompatible with a lurking insanity. His answers to the
questions put to him were mysterious, and calculated to produce
the impression that he was instigated or employed by a
society, with which the crime had originated, but I expect
that it will turn out that he had no accomplices, and is only
a crackbrained enthusiast, whose madness has taken the
turn of vanity and desire for notoriety. No other conjecture
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
presents any tolerable probability. However it may
turn out&mdash;here is the strange fact&mdash;that a half-crazy potboy
was on the point of influencing the destiny of the Empire,
and of producing effects the magnitude and importance of
which no human mind can guess at. It is remarkable how
seldom attempts like these are successful, and yet the life of
any individual is at the mercy of any other, provided this
other is prepared to sacrifice his own life, which, in the
present instance, the culprit evidently was.</p>

<h3>August 13th, 1840</h3>

<p>Two months have elapsed since I have
written anything in this book, owing to an unaccountable
repugnance, which daily grew stronger, to take up my pen
for that purpose. It is true that I had nothing of great
interest to note down, but I could frequently have found
something worth recollecting if I had not been too idle, too
occupied with other things, or paralysed by the disgust I
had taken to the task of journalising. It is now too late
to record things as I was told them, or events as they
occurred, and all is confusion in my recollections. If I
were now to begin to describe the transactions of the late
two months, I should be writing history, for which I am in
no way qualified. However, as I must make up my mind to
begin again, and write something, or give up the practice
altogether, and as I don&rsquo;t choose (just yet, at least) to do
the latter, I will scribble what occurs to me, and take a
short survey of the Parliamentary campaign that is just
over. The danger, whether real or supposed, which the
Queen ran from the attempt of the half-witted coxcomb who
fired at her, elicited whatever there was of dormant loyalty
in her lieges, and made her extremely popular. Nothing
could be more enthusiastic than her reception at Ascot,
where dense multitudes testified their attachment to her
person, and their joy at her recent escape by more than
usual demonstrations. Partly, perhaps, from the universality
of the interest evinced, and partly from a judicious
influence or more impartial reflection, she began about this
time to make her Court much less exclusive, and all these
circumstances produced a better state of feeling between the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">REVIEW OF THE SESSION.</span>
Court and the Tories, and helped to soften the acrimony of
political warfare.</p>

<p>Throughout the Session the Ministerial majorities continued
to be small and uncertain; but it was all along
evident that the Government would not be turned out, that
the leaders of the Opposition did not wish to turn them out,
and that the differences which prevailed in the Tory party
rendered it anything but desirable a change should take place.
Consequently, for one reason or other, the Government were
never pressed hard upon any points on which defeat would
have compelled them to resign. The greatest, most hard-fought,
and lengthened contest was upon Stanley&rsquo;s Irish
Registration Bill, which was admirably devised as a party
measure, very ably worked, and in support of which the
whole body of the Tories came down, night after night, with
a constancy, zeal, and unanimity, really remarkable. Their
repeated majorities elated them to such a pitch that they
were ready, one and all, to relinquish everything else, to
come and vote on these questions. It was evident, however,
that all their exertions would be foiled by the determination
of their opponents to interpose such delays and obstacles as
must prove fatal to the measure; and it was not the least
judicious part of Stanley&rsquo;s management when he came down
to the House, and, after his long series of victories, announced
that he had abandoned his Bill for this year. It
was an extremely embarrassing question to Government,
and one upon which they could not appear in a favourable
point of view. On one hand they were compelled to aid and
abet their Irish allies in their opposition to this Bill, so fatal
as it would have been to their influence in all the vexatious
and unfair modes which they adopted; and on the other
hand it showed how little this self-called Reform Ministry
cared for any measure of Reform, or rather how heartily
they were opposed to any of which the tendency would be
injurious to their own political influence. There never was
a simpler question of Reform than this, a clearer case of
wrong, or one which more loudly demanded a remedy; but
the wrong was one by which they largely benefited, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the correction of it would have the effect of augmenting
the power of their opponents. Accordingly, by every species
of sophistry, by falsehoods of all kinds, by vehement denunciations
and endeavours to arouse the passions of the Irish
people, they moved Heaven and earth to thwart and defeat
the measure. There was, however, only one moment at
which the Government were in any jeopardy, for they very
early resolved not to let the majorities against them shake
them out of their seats. But when Stanley, complaining of
the unfair means which had been employed to prevent his
bringing on his measure in its different stages, announced
that he would invade the days reserved for Government
business, Lord John Russell began darkly to hint at the
impossibility of the Government conducting the public business
if the House sanctioned such an encroachment, and
much irritation was exhibited for a short time. Both parties,
however, got calm, and a compromise was the result. The
Government offered Stanley certain days, which he immediately
accepted, acknowledging that nothing but an extreme
provocation would justify the course he had threatened to
adopt, and so the storm blew over; and this question was
nearly the only one which produced any violent debates and
close divisions. Besides the usual light skirmishing and the
taunts, accusations, and reproaches, here and there thrown
out against the Government, there were no serious attacks
upon their policy and measures, either domestic or foreign;
and upon the whole, setting apart the smallest of their
dependable majority, they got through the Session with
remarkable success, and have closed it apparently stronger,
and with more of public confidence and approbation by
many degrees than they enjoyed at the opening. And I
believe this to be the truth, notwithstanding the fact
that almost all the elections occurring during the Session
(in which there have been contests) have been carried by the
Tories.</p>

<h3>August 18th, 1840 (continued at the Grove)</h3>

<p>This improved
condition of the Ministry is attributable partly to the success
of their measures and the efficient manner in which the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD JOHN RUSSELL AS LEADER.</span>
most important offices have been filled, and partly to the
dissensions which prevailed among their adversaries, some
striking symptoms of which were exhibited to the public.
At the end of the Session, Sir Robert Inglis said to one of
the Government people: &lsquo;Well, you have managed to get
through the Session very successfully.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the other,
&lsquo;thanks to your dissensions among yourselves.&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said
Sir Robert, &lsquo;it is not that, but it is the conduct of your
leader, his honesty, courage, and ability, which has enabled
you to do so.&rsquo; Ley, the Clerk of the House of Commons,
and a man of great experience, said he had never seen the
business so well conducted as by John Russell. Besides
this, his reputation in his office is immense, where all his
subordinates admit that Colonial affairs never were so well
administered. But there can be no doubt that the ill-humour,
which on several occasions broke out, sometimes
between the leaders and sometimes among the masses
of the party&mdash;&lsquo;The Tory Democracy,&rsquo; as the &lsquo;Standard&rsquo;
calls them&mdash;was of essential service to the Government.
This first began at the end of last year upon the
Privilege question, which Peel took up vehemently, and
at once identified himself with John Russell in support
of the privileges of the House of Commons. The moment
Parliament opened, this matter came under discussion, and
for some time exclusively occupied the attention of the
House of Commons. There could be no doubt that if Peel
had changed his mind and taken the adverse side, he would
have thrown the Government into great difficulty and embarrassment,
but instead of doing so he took the Privilege
side still more warmly than before, threw himself into the
van of the contest, and was the most strenuous and the
ablest advocate in the cause. Nothing could exceed the
disappointment and annoyance of the great body of the
Tories at his conduct. Many of them opposed him, and
though Graham, Stanley, and others of the principal men
voted with him, they did so very reluctantly, and maintained
an invincible silence throughout all the discussions.
When at last it was settled that a Bill should be introduced,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
and that Bill had passed the House of Commons,
considerable doubt existed whether it would pass the Lords,
the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s opinion being decidedly at variance
with Peel&rsquo;s on the question. Nothing could have
gratified his party more than the rejection of this Bill by
the Lords, but however well inclined the Duke was to reject
it, he knew that this would be too desperate a game to play,
and while it might lead to the dissolution of the Government,
it would entail that of the Tory party also. Many
conferences took place between Graham and Arbuthnot
and Lyndhurst, the result of which was, that the Duke
was persuaded to let the Bill pass, but this was not accomplished
without much murmuring against the obstinacy of
Peel.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the China question was brought forward
by Graham, but whatever benefit they expected to derive
from this attack on the Government was entirely marred by
the Duke&rsquo;s speech in the House of Lords, in which he completely
threw over Graham, as well as all who supported
him; and while this vexed and offended the Tory leaders in
the Commons, the &lsquo;Democracy&rsquo; were as indignant with the
Duke as they had lately been with Peel. After this, a sort
of running fight went on (Stanley&rsquo;s battles presenting the
only important results) up to the period of the introduction
of the Canada
Bill.<a name="FNA_08_10" id="FNA_08_10"></a><a href="#FN_08_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
To this Peel offered no opposition
whatever, and it passed the House of Commons with his concurrence,
and consequently without difficulties or even divisions.
But as soon as it got into the Lords, the Duke broke
out in fierce hostility against it, denounced its provisions in
the most unmeasured terms, and for a considerable time nobody
knew whether they would throw it out or not. Peel
(it appeared) had taken his line and supported the Bill, without
any previous concert with the Duke, and the latter, as
well as all the Tory Lords, were exceedingly indignant at
finding themselves so far committed by his conduct that it
became absolutely impossible for them to throw it out. Why
Peel did not communicate with the Duke, I cannot divine,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE DUKE CONTROLS THE TORIES.</span>
or why it was not made a great party measure, and a resolution
taken to act in concert. Lyndhurst spoke to me (one
day that I met him) with great bitterness against Peel. I
asked him, &lsquo;What do you mean to do?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, God knows;
pass the Bill, I suppose, there&rsquo;s nothing else left for us to do.&rsquo;
Wharncliffe, while bewailing the schism, and the bad effect
of its manifestation, attributed Peel&rsquo;s reserve to temper, and
some remains of <i>pique</i> at what had previously passed about
the Privilege and China questions. But whatever was the
cause, Peel was quite right not to oppose this Bill, unless
he was prepared with a better measure, and to take office
with the intention of acting upon a different principle, and
he distinctly said that he had nothing better to suggest.
The subsequent conduct of the Duke throughout the whole
proceeding in the House of Lords was curiously indicative
of the actual state of his mind, of his disposition, and his
faculties. His disposition is become excessively excitable and
irritable, his faculties sometimes apparently weakened, and at
others giving signs of all their accustomed vigour. He came
down to the House and attacked this Bill with an asperity
quite inconsistent with his abstaining from throwing it out.
He loaded it with every sort of abuse, but allowed it to pass
almost without any alteration. In thus doing to the measure
all the moral damage he could, he gave way to his
passion, and acted a part which I am convinced he would
not have done in his better days, and which was quite at
variance with the patriotic spirit by which he is usually animated.
His violence not unnaturally encouraged his equally
ardent but less prudent followers, to a more practical attack,
and Hardwicke gave notice of his motion. The Duke, however,
was fully alive to all the consequences that would result
from the rejection of a Bill to which Peel had given an unqualified
support in the House of Commons, and he resolved
to exert all his great authority to restrain the zeal that his
own speeches had so highly inflamed. He accordingly summoned
the Lords to Apsley House, and made them a speech
in which he stated all the reasons for which it was desirable
not to throw out the Bill; and Aberdeen told Clarendon that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
in his life he had never heard a more admirable statement.
It required, however, all his great influence to restrain
them, and though they acquiesced (as they always do at
his bidding) with surprising docility, they did so with the
greatest reluctance.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_08_10" id="FN_08_10"></a><a href="#FNA_08_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
[This was a Bill for dealing with the Canada Clergy Reserves.]</p></div>

<h3>London, August 19th, 1840</h3>

<p>In the conversation at which
Aberdeen told Clarendon this, he dilated upon the marvellous
influence of the Duke, and the manner in which he
treated his followers, and the language they endured from
him. Clarendon asked him whether, when the Duke retired,
he had any hopes of being able to govern them as well; to
which he replied that he had not the slightest idea of it;
on the contrary, that it would be impossible, that nobody
else could govern them, and when his influence was withdrawn,
they would split into every variety of opinion according
to their several biases and dispositions. He said he did
not think the Duke of Wellington had ever rendered greater
service in his whole life than he had done this session in
moderating violence and keeping his own party together and
in order, and that he could still do the most essential service
in the same way, and much more than by active leading in
Parliament.</p>

<p>Out of this state of things a practical consequence has
ensued of no slight importance, and one which has shown
that if there are evils and disadvantages incident to a weak
Government, these are not without some counterbalancing
good. Both parties began to feel the necessity of dealing
with certain questions of pressing importance in a spirit of
compromise and mutual concession. Neither were strong
enough to go on insisting upon having everything their own
way, and each was conscious that the other had a fair right
to require some sacrifice, so far as it could be made without
compromising on either side any vital principle. Accordingly
several questions were amicably and quietly settled, in
all probability in a more just, expedient, and satisfactory way
than they would have been by either party uncontrolled and
unrestrained. The Irish Corporation Bill, which for years
has been a topic of bitter contention, has at last been carried
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ADVANTAGES OF A WEAK GOVERNMENT.</span>
with very little difficulty and discussion. The alterations of
the Lords were quietly accepted by the Commons, and the
ultras on both sides were alone dissatisfied at the consummation.
Then the Education Question, which last year
raised a regular storm, both in Parliament and out, has
been arranged between the Government and the heads of
the Church, and the system is permanently established in
such a manner as to allay all fears and jealousies. In the
same spirit, I expect that next year some mode will be found
of conciliating Stanley&rsquo;s Bill with the Government Bill of
Irish Registration, and that some measure not quite but
tolerably satisfactory to all parties will be devised, and the
evil complained of, to a certain degree, be checked. These
are advantages of no small moment, and it is very questionable
whether the work of government and legislation is not
more wisely and beneficially done by this concurrence of antagonistic
parties, and compromise and fusion of antagonistic
opinions, than it could be in any other way. All strong
Governments become to a certain degree careless and insolent
in the confidence of their strength, but their weakness
renders them circumspect and conscientious. Governments
with great majorities at their back can afford to do gross
jobs, or take strong party measures; but when their opponents
are as strong as themselves, and their majorities are
never secure, they can venture upon nothing of the kind. All
oppositions must affect a prodigious show of political virtue,
and must be vigilant and economical, no matter how lax
may have been their political morality when in power. But
no politician, or party man, has any tenderness for an abuse
the profit of which is to accrue to his adversary, and in this
way good government may happen to be the result of a weak
Ministry and a strong Opposition.</p>

<h3>August 24th, 1840</h3>

<p>Passed the greatest part of last week at
the Grove, where Clarendon talked to me a great deal about
the Eastern Question, and Palmerston&rsquo;s policy in that quarter.
Palmerston, it seems, has had for many years as his fixed
idea the project of humbling the Pasha of
Egypt.<a name="FNA_08_11" id="FNA_08_11"></a><a href="#FN_08_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
In the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Cabinet he has carried everything his own way; all his colleagues
either really concurring with him, or being too ignorant
and too indifferent to fight the battle against his strong
determination, except Lord Holland and Clarendon, who did
oppose with all their strength Palmerston&rsquo;s recent treaty;
but quite ineffectually. They had for their only ally, Lord
Granville at Paris, and nothing can exceed the contempt
with which the Palmerstonians treat this little knot of dissentients,
at least the two elder ones, who (they say) are
become quite imbecile, and they wonder Lord Granville does
not resign. Palmerston, in fact, appears to exercise an absolute
despotism at the Foreign Office, and deals with all our
vast and complicated questions of diplomacy according to
his own views and opinions, without the slightest control,
and scarcely any interference on the part of his colleagues.
This apathy is mainly attributable to that which appears in
Parliament and in the country upon all foreign questions.
Nobody understands and nobody cares for them, and when
any rare and occasional notice is taken of a particular point,
or of some question on which a slight and evanescent interest
is manifested, Palmerston has little difficulty in dealing with
the matter, which he always meets with a consummate impudence
and, it must be allowed, a skill and resolution,
which invariably carry him through. Whether the policy
which he has adopted upon the Eastern Question be the
soundest and most judicious, events must determine; but I
never was more amazed than at reading his letters, so dashing,
bold, and confident in their tone. Considering the immensity
of the stake for which he is playing, that he <i>may</i> be
about to plunge all Europe into a war, and that if war does
ensue it will be entirely his doing, it is utterly astonishing
he should not be more seriously affected than he appears to
be with the gravity of the circumstances, and should not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE TREATY OF JULY.</span>
look with more anxiety (if not apprehension) to the possible
results; but he talks in the most off-hand way of the clamour
that broke out at Paris, of his entire conviction that the
French Cabinet have no thoughts of going to war, and that
if they were to do so, their fleets would be instantly swept
from the sea, and their armies everywhere defeated. That if
they were to try and make it a war of opinion and stir up
the elements of revolution in other countries, a more fatal
retaliation could and would be effected in France, where
Carlist or Napoleonist interest, aided by foreign intervention,
would shake the throne of Louis Philippe, while taxation
and conscription would very soon disgust the French
with a war in which he did not anticipate the possibility
of their gaining any military successes. Everything may
possibly turn out according to his expectations. He is a
man blessed with extraordinary good fortune, and his motto
seems to be that of Danton, &lsquo;De l&rsquo;audace, encore de l&rsquo;audace,
et toujours de l&rsquo;audace.&rsquo; But there is a flippancy in his tone,
an undoubting self-sufficiency, and a levity in discussing
interests of such tremendous magnitude, which satisfies me
that he is a very dangerous man to be entrusted with the
uncontrolled management of our foreign relations. But our
Cabinet is a complete republic, and Melbourne, their ostensible
head, has no overruling authority, and is too indolent
and too averse to energetic measures to think of having
any, or to desire it. Any man of resolution and obstinacy
does what he will with Melbourne. Nothing was ever so
peremptory and determined as John Russell about Poulett
Thomson&rsquo;s peerage, which the others did not at all like, but
which he not only insisted upon, but actually threatened
to resign unless it was done by a given day. It was with
the greatest difficulty they could prevail on him to defer
its being gazetted till Parliament was up, Duncannon and
others dreading that it would excite the choler of the Duke
of Wellington, and very likely provoke him to fall foul of
some of their Bills.</p>

[The Treaty between England, Russia, Austria, and Prussia for the
settlement of the affairs of the East, by compelling the Pasha of Egypt to
relinquish Syria, and to restrict his dominion in Egypt, was signed in
London on July 15, 1840. France having declined to concur in this policy,
the Treaty was signed without her, and without her knowledge. This
event was of the gravest consequence, and brought Europe to the brink
of war.]</p></div>

<p>M. Dedel<a name="FNA_08_12" id="FNA_08_12"></a><a href="#FN_08_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
told me the other day that he thought, without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
reference to his policy, Palmerston had conducted himself
with a <i>légèreté</i> quite unaccountable; that the Duke of
Wellington, when he was at Windsor, had talked over the
state of affairs with Melbourne, and said to him, &lsquo;I do not
say that I disapprove of your policy as far as regards Mehemet
Ali; perhaps I do not think that you go far enough; not
only would I not leave him in possession of a foot of ground
in Syria, but I should have no scruple in expelling him
from Egypt too. But what is Mehemet Ali or the Turk in
comparison with the immeasurable importance of preserving
peace in Europe? this is the thing alone to be regarded, and
I give you notice that you must not expect our support in
Parliament of the policy which you have chosen to
adopt.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_08_13" id="FNA_08_13"></a><a href="#FN_08_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
In the meantime there is an increasing impression here that
no war will take place; public opinion is not yet much excited,
and is nothing like so excitable as it is in France upon
questions of foreign policy, where everybody thinks and talks
on the subject; but if it ever is effectually roused, it will be
much stronger and probably more consistent here than there.
My brother writes me word that the King is most anxious to
preserve peace, and is now feeling the pulse of the country,
and doing his utmost to ascertain what the state of public
opinion is, for his own guidance in the approaching crisis.
Though now acting in apparent unison with Thiers, he would
have no scruple in resisting the course of policy in which
Thiers is embarked, if he found he could count upon the
support of the country in his own pacific views; and it is
the possibility of such a contest occurring in France which
renders the question so very delicate and difficult, and makes
the issue dependent on contingencies which no sagacity can
foresee or provide for. Out of this complication Palmerston&rsquo;s
wonderful luck may possibly extricate him, though it must
be owned that he is playing a very desperate game.</p>

Clarendon, to whom I told this, said it was not true: he had said
nothing about their support, but had said, &lsquo;I approve of your policy, but
you must have no war.&rsquo;</p></div>

<h3>September 5th, 1840</h3>

<p>I have been more in the way of hearing
about the Eastern Question during the last week than at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">OPPOSITION TO LORD PALMERSTON.</span>
any previous time, though my informants and associates
have been all of the anti-Palmerston interest&mdash;Holland
House, and Clarendon, Dedel (who objects to the form more
than the <i>fond</i>), and Madame de Lieven, who is all with
Guizot, because he is devoted to her, and she feels the
greatest interest where she gets the most information.
Clarendon showed me the other day a long letter which
he wrote to Palmerston in March last, in which he discussed
the whole question, stating the objections to which he thought
Palmerston&rsquo;s policy liable, and suggesting what <i>he</i> would
have done instead. It was a well-written and well-reasoned
document enough.</p>

<p>Those who are opposed to Palmerston&rsquo;s policy, and even
some who do not object to the policy itself so much as to the
manner in which it has been worked out, feel confident that
the means will fall very short of accomplishing the end, and
that peace will be preserved by their very impotence at a
great expense of the diplomatic reputation of the parties
concerned; and they are confirmed in this notion by the
failure of some of the anticipations in which Palmerston so
confidently indulged, especially the conduct of the Pasha
and the Syrian insurrection. Clarendon says that, &lsquo;whatever
his opinions may have been, now that they are fairly embarked
in Palmerston&rsquo;s course, he must as earnestly desire
its success as if he had been its original advocate.&rsquo; But both
he and Lord Holland have been so vehemently committed in
opposition to it, that, without any imputation of unpatriotic
feelings, it is not in human nature they should not find a
sort of satisfaction in the frustration of those measures which
they so strenuously resisted, and this clearly appears in all
Lord Holland said to me, and in Lady Holland&rsquo;s tone about
Palmerston and his daring disposition.</p>

<h3>September 6th, 1840</h3>

<p>On arriving in town this morning, I
found a note from M. Guizot, begging I would call on him,
as he wanted to have a few minutes&rsquo; conversation with me.
Accordingly I went, and am just returned. His object was
to put me in possession of the actual state of affairs, and to
read me a letter he had just received from Thiers, together
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
with one (either to Thiers or to him) from their Consul-General
at Alexandria.</p>

<p>Thiers&rsquo; letter expressed considerable alarm. After describing
the failure of Walewski and the other French
agents, and enlarging upon the efforts they had made, and
were still making, to restrain the Pasha, and prevent his
making any offensive movement, he said that this was the
Pasha&rsquo;s ultimatum. He offered, if France would join him
and make common cause with him, to place his fleets and
armies at her disposal, and to be governed in all things by
her advice and wishes, a thing utterly impossible for France
to listen to. Upon the impossibility of this alliance being
represented to him, the prudence of keeping quiet strenuously
urged upon him, and the utmost endeavours made to
convince him that a defensive policy was the only wise
and safe course for him, he had engaged not to move forward,
or take any offensive course unless compelled to do
so, by violence offered to him; his army was concentrated
at the foot of the Taurus, and there (but in a menacing attitude)
he would consent to its remaining; but if any European
troops were to advance against him, or be transported to
Syria, any attempt made to foment another insurrection
in Syria, or any attack made upon his fleet, or any violence
offered to his commerce, then he would cross the Taurus,
and, taking all consequences, commence offensive operations.
In that case, said Guizot, Constantinople might be occupied by
the Russians, and the British fleet enter the Sea of Marmora;
and if that happened, he could not answer for the result in
France, and he owned that he (and Thiers expressed the
same in his letter) was in the greatest alarm at all these
dangers and complications. He had seen Palmerston this
morning, and read Thiers&rsquo; letter to him. I asked him if it
had made any impression on Palmerston. He said, &lsquo;Not the
slightest;&rsquo; that he had said, &lsquo;Oh! Mehemet Ali cédera; il
ne faut pas s&rsquo;attendre qu&rsquo;il cède à la première sommation;
mais donnez-lui quinze jours, et il finira par céder.&rsquo; Guizot
said that the failure of so many of his predictions and expectations
had not in the slightest degree diminished Palmerston&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE POLICY OF FRANCE.</span>
confidence, and that there was in fact no use whatever
in speaking to him on the subject. Guizot is evidently in
great alarm, and well he may be, for there can be no doubt
that his Government are in a position of the greatest embarrassment,
far from inclined to war, the King especially
abhorring the very thoughts of it, and at the same time
so far committed that if the four allies act with any vigour
and drive Mehemet Ali to desperation, France must either
kindle the flames of war, or, after all her loud and threatening
tone, succumb in a manner not only intolerably galling to
the national pride, but which really would be very discreditable
in itself.</p>

<p>Guizot dwelt very much upon their long-continued and
earnest efforts to make the Pasha moderate and prudent, and
on the offers he had made to join the allies, and unite the
authority of France to that of all the others for the purpose
of preventing the Pasha from advancing a step further,
provided they would leave him in his present possessions.
I certainly never saw a man more seriously or sincerely
alarmed, and I think (now that it is so near) that the French
Government would avoid war at almost any cost; but the
great evil of the present state of affairs is, that the conduct
of the question has escaped out of the hands of the Ministers
and statesmen by whom it has hitherto been handled, and
henceforward must depend upon the passions or caprice
of the Pasha, and the discretion of the numerous commanders
in any of the fleets now gathered in the Mediterranean,
and even upon the thousand accidents to which,
with the most prudent and moderate instructions from home,
and the best intentions in executing them, the course of
events is exposed. As Guizot said, Europe is at the mercy
&lsquo;des incidents et des subalternes.&rsquo; He promised to keep
me informed of everything that might occur of interest.</p>

<h3>September 10th, 1840</h3>

<p>The day after I saw Guizot I related to
Clarendon all that had passed, when he told me that Melbourne
was now become seriously alarmed, so much so that
he had written to John Russell, &lsquo;he could neither eat, nor
drink, nor sleep,&rsquo; so great was his disturbance. Lord John
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
was also extremely alarmed, and both he and Melbourne had
been considerably moved by a letter the former had received
from the Duke of Bedford, enclosing one from Lord Spencer,
in which he entered into the whole Eastern Question; and
said that it was his earnest desire to give his support to the
Government in all their measures, but that it would be contrary
to his judgement and his conscience to support them
in their policy on this question. This appears to have made
a great impression upon them, but not the least upon Palmerston,
who is quite impenetrable, and who always continues
more or less to influence his colleagues; for Lord
John, after meeting Palmerston at Windsor, came back
easier in his mind, and, as he said, with a conviction (not
apparently founded on any solid reason), &lsquo;that they should
pull through.&rsquo; Palmerston, so far from being at all shaken
by anything Guizot said to him, told him that the only fault
he had committed was not taking Lord Ponsonby&rsquo;s advice
and proceeding to action long ago. The second edition of
the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; mentions a violent note delivered by Pontois to
the Porte. I thought this of such consequence that I sent
the paper to Guizot, and begged him, if he could, to afford
the means of contradicting it. He wrote me word he would,
as soon as he had <i>des renseignements plus précis</i>.
In the meantime, I find Metternich has protested against the tone
of Pontois&rsquo; communication, which was verbal and not written.
His own account of it to Thiers exhibited strong, but not
indecent language.</p>

<p>In the evening (day before yesterday), Guizot dined at
Holland House, and met Clarendon and Lord John Russell,
with the latter of whom he had a long talk, and he hoped
that he had made an impression on him. Yesterday morning
I was enabled to read the Cabinet minute, submitting to
the Queen the expediency of making the Treaty, to which
was appended the dissent of Clarendon and Holland, with
their reasons assigned in a short but well-written and well-reasoned
paper. The Queen desired to keep it, and there
can be little doubt that in her heart she coincides with them,
for Leopold is frightened out of his senses, and is sure to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ADMIRAL NAPIER&rsquo;S PROCLAMATION.</span>
made her in some degree partake of his alarm. She told
Melbourne that, of all things, what astonished her most was
the coolness and indifference of Palmerston. It is remarkable
that Clarendon, who expresses himself with energy, was
never asked to Windsor while Leopold was there, Palmerston
being there the whole time; and the day that Leopold
departed, Clarendon was invited.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning arrived a fresh budget of alarming
news, amongst the rest a proclamation of Admiral Napier,
which people are disposed to consider a forgery and an impossibility,
but which was believed at Paris and by Guizot here,
and consequently raised a storm there, and put the Ambassador
in despair. Clarendon went to him in the afternoon,
when he broke out: &lsquo;Mon cher Comte, I appeal to you, as
representing the Government, to tell me what I am to think
of such a proceeding as this, and how is it possible that I
can continue to &lsquo;gérer les affaires de mon gouvernement&rsquo;
here, if such provocations as this proclamation are to occur.&rsquo;
Clarendon acknowledged that if this proclamation was authentic,
nothing was to be said in its defence, but urged that
no definite judgement should be formed till they had some
conclusive information; but he told me, that he should not
be surprised to find that it was authentic and in virtue of
instruction from Ponsonby, and he fully expected Palmerston
would highly approve of it. When it was suggested to Palmerston
that it might with every effort be impossible to prevent
the Pasha from crossing the Taurus, he said, &lsquo;So much
the better if he did, that he would not be able to retreat,
his communication be cut off, and his ruin the more certainly
accomplished.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>September 12th, 1840</h3>

<p>Yesterday at Windsor for a Council,
when Prince Albert was introduced. The Ministers who
were there had a sort of Cabinet afterwards, and a discussion
about increasing the naval force, which Lord Minto thought
they could not venture to do without calling Parliament
together; but they agreed that this was to be avoided, and
would be on every account objectionable. They might incur
any expense for naval affairs on their own responsibility, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Parliament would be sure to bear them out. After dinner,
a messenger came, and Melbourne went out to read the contents
of his box. I remarked that nobody occupied <i>his</i> chair
next the Queen; it was left vacant, like Banquo&rsquo;s, till he came
back, so that it was established as exclusively <i>his</i>. I heard
this morning what this box contained: letters from Sir F.
Lamb,<a name="FNA_08_14" id="FNA_08_14"></a><a href="#FN_08_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
to Palmerston, in which he told him that he wished
him every success in his present undertaking, would do
everything that he could to assist him, but acknowledged
that he had not the least notion what he could do, or how
anything could be done by anybody; intimating his conviction,
in short, that their Convention was not executable. As
for Metternich, he is at his wit&rsquo;s end, and occupied night
and day in thinking how he can <i>se tirer d&rsquo;affaire.</i> He tells
Lamb that as to contributing a guinea or a soldier towards
the operation, it is quite out of the question, and begs him
never to mention such a thing, and that if the Treaty could
quietly fall to the ground it would be a very good thing. It
is, however, entirely contemplated by the other Powers that
Russia shall occupy Constantinople, and march to the assistance
of the Sultan if necessary; but it is quite clear that
Metternich is resolved to prevent a war by any means, and
that he would not care for his share of humiliation or the
object of the Convention being baffled. All this, however,
does not damp the ardour or diminish the confidence of
Palmerston, who says, &lsquo;Everything is going on as well as
possible.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_08_14" id="FN_08_14"></a><a href="#FNA_08_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a>
[Sir Frederic Lamb, afterwards Lord Beauvale, was at this time ambassador
at the Court of Austria.]</p></div>

<p>When I got to town I found a note from Guizot begging
I would call on him. I went, and he read me a letter
from Thiers about &lsquo;the note&rsquo; of M. de Pontois at Constantinople,
in which he explained that it was a verbal communication,
and not a note, and that it had been grossly
exaggerated; and he read me Pontois&rsquo; despatch to Thiers.
I then asked him if he knew anything of Metternich and
his disposition; and when he said, no, and asked me very
anxiously if I could tell him anything, I told him that I

<span class="pagehead">ALARM OF LORD MELBOURNE AND LORD JOHN.</span>
thought it was so strongly turned towards peace, and he
was so anxious to relieve himself from the embarrassment in
which he was placed, that they might turn it to good account,
if they were to set about it.</p>

<h3>September 13th, 1840</h3>

<p>All last week at Doncaster; nothing
new, but a considerable rise in the funds, indicating a reviving
confidence in peace. Have seen nobody since I came
back.</p>

<h3>September 22nd, 1840</h3>

<p>Came from Gorhambury yesterday. Got
a letter from the Duke of Bedford, in which he says, &lsquo;John
has been here for the last week and has spoken very freely
and openly to me on the state of our foreign relations.
Matters are very serious,   and may produce events both at
home and abroad which neither you nor I can calculate
upon. John is very uneasy and talks of going to town. You
are aware that he came up from Scotland unexpectedly. Between
ourselves, I think he is disposed to make a stand, and
to act, if occasion requires it, a great part&mdash;whether for good
or evil, God alone knows. Nobody, not even his colleagues,
except Melbourne, knows what is passing.&rsquo; In a postscript
he said that Lord John had urged Melbourne to summon a
Cabinet, and, accordingly, one is summoned to meet next
Monday. This is mysterious, but it can only mean one thing.
Lord John, already alarmed by Lord Spencer&rsquo;s letter, and
dreading the possibility of a war, is resolved to oppose Palmerston&rsquo;s
headlong policy, and, if it be necessary, to risk a
rupture in the Cabinet, and take upon himself the administration
of Foreign affairs. The Foreign Office was originally
that which he wished to have, and when Melbourne returned
to office, they proposed to Palmerston to take either the
Home or Colonial, but he would not hear of anything but
the Foreign department.</p>

<p>I talked over this letter with Clarendon last night (from
whom I have no secrets), and he, while fully agreeing in the
propriety of calling the Cabinet together, and making the
future transaction of foreign affairs a matter for the Government
and not for the Foreign Office only, and of course well
disposed to buckle on his armour on this question, acknowledged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
that Palmerston would have very good reason to complain
of any strong opposition from that quarter, inasmuch
as he had been all along encouraged to proceed in his present
line of policy by the concurrence and support of John Russell,
who was in fact just as much responsible as Palmerston
himself for the present state of affairs.</p>

<p>The beginning of the business may be traced to a Cabinet
held at Windsor last autumn, when the general line of policy,
since acted upon by Palmerston, was settled. From that
time, however, the rest of the Ministers seem never to have
interfered, or taken any interest in the matter, and Palmerston
conducted it all just as he thought fit. This year
Cabinet after Cabinet passed over, and no mention was ever
made of the affairs of the East, till one day, at the end of a
Cabinet, Palmerston, in the most easy nonchalant way
imaginable, said that he thought it right to mention that
he had been for a long time engaged in negotiation upon the
principles agreed upon at the Cabinet at Windsor, and that
he had drawn up a Treaty, with which it was fit the Cabinet
should be acquainted. At this sudden announcement his
colleagues looked very serious, but nobody said a word,
except Lord Holland, who said, &lsquo;that he could be no party
to any measure which might be likely to occasion a breach
between this country and France.&rsquo; No discussion, however,
took place at that time, and it was agreed that the further
consideration of the matter should be postponed till the next
Cabinet. The following day, Palmerston wrote a letter to
Melbourne, in which he said that he saw some hesitation and
some disapprobation in the Cabinet at the course which he
had recommended for adoption, and as he could only hope
to succeed by obtaining unanimous support, he thought it
better at once to place his office at Melbourne&rsquo;s disposal.
Melbourne wrote an answer begging he would not think of
resigning, and reminding him that the matter stood over for
discussion, and then sent the whole correspondence to Clarendon.
Clarendon immediately wrote word that he felt under
so much obligation to Palmerston that it was painful to him
to oppose him; but as he could not support him in his Eastern
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE EASTERN QUESTION.</span>
policy, it was much better that <i>he</i> should resign, and begged
Melbourne would accept <i>his</i> resignation. Melbourne however
said, &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, let there be no resignations at
all,&rsquo;<a name="FNA_08_15" id="FNA_08_15"></a><a href="#FN_08_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
that his and Lord Holland&rsquo;s retirement would have the effect
of breaking up the Government; and then it was suggested
that they might guard themselves by a minute of Cabinet
(that which they subsequently drew up and gave the Queen)
from any participation in the measures they objected to.
After this, Palmerston continued to do just as he pleased,
his colleagues <i>consentientibus</i> or at least <i>non dissentientibus</i>,
except Holland and Clarendon, with whom nevertheless he
seems (especially the latter) to have gone on upon very good
terms. Latterly, however, since the affair has got so hot
and critical, though their social relations have been uninterrupted,
and the Palmerstons have been constantly dining
at Holland House, Palmerston has never said one word to
Lord Holland on the subject, and he is unquestionably very
sore at the undisguised manner in which Lord Holland has
signified his dislike of Palmerston&rsquo;s foreign policy, and the
great civilities that Lord and Lady Holland have shown to
Guizot for some time past.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_08_15" id="FN_08_15"></a><a href="#FNA_08_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a>
I own I cannot see why. Their retirement would have proved the
unanimity of the rest, and would rather have strengthened Palmerston than
not.</p></div>

<p>The manner in which business is conducted and the
independence of the Foreign Office are curiously displayed
by the following fact. Last Wednesday a Protocol was signed
(very proper in itself), in which the four Powers disclaimed
any intention of aggrandising themselves in any way. The
fact of this Protocol was told to Clarendon by Dr. Bowring,
who had heard it in the City, and to Lord Holland by Dedel,
neither of these Ministers having the slightest notion of its
existence. In the meantime, while the apprehensions of
Melbourne and John Russell, thus tardily aroused, have urged
them to the adoption of a measure which may possibly break
up the Government, or at all events bring about some important
changes of one sort or another, the French are
making vigorous preparations for war, and, having persuaded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the Pasha to send a new proposal to Constantinople, Thiers
has intimated that, if this be rejected, France will give him
active support, and then war will be inevitable. The crisis,
therefore, seems actually on the point of arriving, and while
all the world here fancies that war is impossible, it appears
to be nearer than ever it was.</p>

<p>Guizot committed a great <i>gaucherie</i> the other day (the
last time he was at Windsor), which he never could have
done if he had had more experience of Courts, or been born
and had lived in that society. The first day, the Queen
desired he would sit next to her at dinner, which he did;
the second day the Lord-in-waiting (Headfort) came as usual
with his list, and told Guizot he was to take out the Queen
of the Belgians, and sit somewhere else; when he drew up
and said, &lsquo;Milord, ma place est auprès de la Reine.&rsquo; Headfort,
quite frightened, hastened back to report what had
happened; when the Queen as wisely altered, as the Ambassador
had foolishly objected to, the disposition of places,
and desired him to sit next herself, as he had done the day
before.</p>

<h3>September 23rd, 1840</h3>

<p>I called on Guizot yesterday morning,
found him apprised of the meeting of the Cabinet on Monday
next, when I told him that I could not help thinking he
might materially contribute to the adoption of some resolution
conducive to peace, that I had no doubt there would
be very lively discussions at this Cabinet, and it was of great
importance he should, if he could, afford an <i>appui</i> to the
peace party. He said he would willingly do anything he
could. I said, &lsquo;for example, could he say on the part of his
Government, that, in the event of the new terms proposed by
Mehemet Ali being accepted, France would guarantee their
due performance on the part of the Pasha, and that she
would join in coercive measures against him if he attempted
to infringe them, or commit any act of aggression against
the Porte?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;that he was not <i>authorised</i> to make
such a declaration, but he had no doubt he could engage so
far, and that France would not hesitate to pledge herself to
join the other Allies and act against Mehemet Ali in such a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DIFFERENCES IN THE CABINET.</span>
case as I had supposed.&rsquo; I asked him if he would write to
his Government forthwith, as there was still time to get an
answer before the Cabinet met, and he promised he would;
but, he added, that with every desire to say what might furnish
an argument for those in the Cabinet who are disposed
to accept the proffered arrangement, he did not know how
to hold any communications&mdash;for with Palmerston he could
not, and Melbourne and John Russell were out of town. I
told him, however, that Lord John would be in town on
Thursday, and he promised he would call on him on Friday
and talk to him; adding that he thought the last time he
saw him he was well disposed. I told him that Lord John
was not a man who said much, and that I could not answer
for his opinions, but that I was quite convinced Palmerston
would find some of his colleagues seriously alarmed, and no
longer disposed to submit quietly to whatever he might be
pleased to settle and to dictate. He asked me who were the
Ministers with the greatest influence, and whose opinions
would sway the Cabinet; and I told him Melbourne and
John Russell, without a doubt, and whatever they resolved
upon, the rest would agree to. But it is most extraordinary
that while all reflecting people are amazed at the Government
being scattered all abroad at such a momentous crisis,
and instead of being collected together for the purpose of
considering in concert every measure that is taken, as well
as the whole course of policy, with any changes and modifications
that may be called for, the Ministers themselves,
such of them at least as are here, cannot discover any occasion
for any Cabinets or meetings, and seem to think it quite
natural and proper to leave the great question of peace or
war to be dealt with by Palmerston as a mere matter of official
routine. Lord Minto and Labouchere could not imagine
why a Cabinet was called, nor by whom, and Palmerston
still less. The day before the summons, he told Labouchere
he might safely go into the country, as there was no chance
of a Cabinet; and now Minto can only imagine that they
are summoned to discuss the time to be fixed for the prorogation
or the meeting of Parliament.</p>

<h3>September 26th, 1840</h3>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
On Wednesday I went to Woburn, and,
as soon as I arrived, the Duke carried me off to his room and
told me everything that had taken place, and the exact
present posture of affairs. John Russell has for some time
past been impressed with the necessity of bringing the
Eastern Question to a settlement, to avert all possibility of
a war with France, and he has repeatedly urged Melbourne
in the strongest terms to do something to prevent the danger
into which the policy of the Treaty is hurrying us. None of
the Ministers, except Melbourne himself, and Palmerston,
have been apprised of these remonstrances, nor are any of
them at this moment aware of what has been and is passing.
Palmerston has been indignant at the opposition thus suddenly
put forward by Lord John, and complains (not, I think,
without very good cause), that after supporting and sanctioning
his policy, and approving of the Treaty, he abandons
him midway, and refuses to give that policy a fair trial.
This he considers unjust and unreasonable, and it must be
owned he is entitled to complain. Lord John, however, as
far as I can learn, not very successfully justifies himself by
saying that it was one thing to defend <i>the treaty</i>, of which
he approved and does still, and another to approve <i>the measures</i>
which are apparently leading us into a war. Between
the urgent remonstrances of Lord John and the indignant
complaints of Palmerston, Melbourne has been at his wit&rsquo;s
end. So melancholy a picture of indecision, weakness, and
pusillanimity as his conduct has exhibited, I never heard of.
The Queen is all this time in a great state of nervousness
and alarm, on account of Leopold; terrified at Palmerston&rsquo;s
audacity, amazed at his confidence, and trembling lest her
uncle should be exposed to all the dangers and difficulties in
which he would be placed by a war between his niece and
his father-in-law. All these sources of solicitude, pressure
from without, and doubt and hesitation within, have raised
that perplexity in Melbourne&rsquo;s mind which has robbed him
(as he told Lord John) of appetite and sleep. At length,
after going on in this way for some time, matters becoming
so bad between Palmerston and Lord John that Palmerston
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD JOHN CALLS A CABINET.</span>
refused to have any communication with him, Lord Spencer&rsquo;s
letter, the continued state of danger, and the prospect of
some arrangement growing out of the new propositions,
made Lord John determine to take a decided course, and he
accordingly requested Melbourne to call a Cabinet, which
was done, and this important meeting is to take place on
Monday next. At this Cabinet, Lord John is prepared to
make a stand, and to propose that measures shall be taken
for bringing about a settlement on the basis of mutual concession,
and he is in fact disposed to accept the terms now
offered by the Pasha with the consent and by the advice of
France. He anticipates Palmerston&rsquo;s opposition to this, and
his insisting upon a continuance of our present course; but
he is resolved in such a case to bring matters to an issue,
and if he is overruled by a majority of the Cabinet, not only
to resign, but to take a decisive part in Parliament against
Palmerston&rsquo;s policy, and to do his utmost there, with the
support which he expects to obtain, to prevent a war. He
is aware that his conduct might not only break up the Whig
Government and party, but that it may bring about an entirely
new arrangement and combination of parties, all of
which he is willing to encounter rather than the evils and
hazards of war. On the other hand, if Palmerston refuses
to accede to his terms, and if unsupported by the Cabinet
he tenders his resignation, Lord John is ready to urge its
acceptance, and himself to undertake the administration of
our foreign affairs. In short, he has made up his mind, and
that so strongly, that I do not think it possible he can fail
either to carry his point or to break up the Government,
or at least bring about very material changes in it.</p>

<p>Prepared as I was, by the Duke of Bedford&rsquo;s letter, for
something of this sort, I was not prepared for anything so
strong and decisive; and while I expressed my satisfaction
at it, I did not conceal my opinion that Lord John&rsquo;s course
had not been at all consistent, and that Palmerston, when
the moment of discussion came, would have a good case
against his antagonist colleague. While I was at Woburn,
I had constant running talk about this matter with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Duke, but not a word with Lord John, to whom I never
uttered, nor he to me.</p>

<p>Yesterday I returned to town, when I found that Lord
John had written both to Lord Holland and Clarendon,
shortly, but saying that he thought the new proposals made
the matter stand very differently. I dined at Holland House,
where the Palmerstons dined also. My own opinion from
the first moment was, that Palmerston never would agree to
any arrangement, but I thought it just possible, if he became
impressed with the magnitude of the danger, that he might
anticipate Lord John, by himself suggesting some attempt
to profit by the disposition of the Pasha to make concessions.
But any such possibility was speedily dissipated, by a conversation
which I had with Lady Palmerston, who spoke
with the utmost bitterness and contempt of these proposals,
as totally out of the question, not worth a moment&rsquo;s attention,
and such as the other Powers would not listen to, even
if we were disposed to accept them; and that we were now
bound to those Powers, and must act in concert with them.
She told me a great deal, which I knew (from other sources)
not to be true, about Metternich&rsquo;s resolution not to make
the slightest concession to France and the Pasha; and her
brother Frederic&rsquo;s strenuous advice and opinion to that
effect. She complained, and said that Frederic complained,
of the mischief which was done by Cabinets which only
bred difficulties, intrigues, and underhand proceedings, and
plainly intimated her opinion that all powers ought to be
centred in, and all action proceed from, the Foreign Office
alone. I told her that I could not see the proposals in the
same light as she did, that some mutual concessions in all
affairs must be expected, and that she was so accustomed to
look at the matter only in a diplomatic point of view that
she was not sufficiently alive to the storm of wrath and
indignation which would burst upon the Government, if war
did ensue upon the rejection of such terms as these, which,
as far as I had been able to gather opinions, appeared to
moderate impartial men fair and reasonable in themselves,
and such as we might accept without dishonour. We had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">COUNT WALEWSKI&rsquo;S MISSION TO EGYPT.</span>
a very long talk, which was principally of importance as
showing the state of her husband&rsquo;s mind, and I told Lord
Holland afterwards what I had said to her, at which he
expressed great satisfaction. I found afterwards that there
has been a correspondence between Palmerston and Holland,
begun by the former, and the object of it to vent his complaints
at the undisguised hostility of Holland House to the
Treaty and its policy. It ended by Holland&rsquo;s refusing to
continue it, and referring Palmerston to the Cabinet on
Monday, when the whole question would come under consideration.</p>

<p>This morning I received a note from Guizot, begging I
would call on him as soon as I could. I went almost directly,
when he produced a letter from Thiers, in which he desired
Guizot to go immediately to Palmerston, and in the most
formal and solemn manner to deny, in his name and in the
name of France, that the mission of
Walewski<a name="FNA_08_16" id="FNA_08_16"></a><a href="#FN_08_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
had had any such object as that which had been imputed to it; that
he had not endeavoured to persuade the Pasha not to accede
to the terms imposed upon him, and that if he was disposed
to accept them, &lsquo;La France ne se montrerait pas plus
ambitieuse pour lui qu&rsquo;il ne l&rsquo;était pour lui-même,&rsquo; and would
certainly not interfere to prevent the execution of the Treaty.
Moreover, he was to say that Walewski had not gone to
Constantinople as the agent of the Pasha, but only to convey
to M. de Pontois the intelligence of the communication
which the Pasha had made to the Sultan through Rifat
Bey, Rifat Bey having been despatched on the 6th with a
very submissive letter from Mehemet Ali to the Sultan, in
which he asked him to grant certain terms, the substance of
which has been already made known. Guizot then said that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
he had likewise received authority to declare that if the Sultan
accepted the terms proposed by Mehemet Ali, or even some
modification of them (such as France could approve of), with
the consent and concurrence of his Allies, and if he invited
France to be a party to the new arrangement, and to join
in guaranteeing a due execution of its provisions, France
would accept such invitation, and would join the other Allies
in compelling Mehemet Ali to a strict observance of the
arrangement, and would, if necessary, use measures of coercion
and hostility against him if he failed in a due performance,
or infringed the limits assigned to him. I told M.
Guizot that nothing could be more satisfactory than these
communications, and he said that he had already asked for
an interview with Palmerston, in order to impart the same
to him. He then wanted to know if he might speak to Lord
John if he met him at Holland House or elsewhere; but I
advised him not, and told him that Palmerston was suspicious
and jealous, and would take umbrage at any of his
colleagues holding communications upon affairs which were
his peculiar concern. He acquiesced altogether, and it was
agreed that I should call on him to-morrow morning and
hear what had passed between Palmerston and him. I took
the opportunity of telling him on that occasion that the
great evil, and that which rendered all negotiation and
arrangement so difficult, was the absence of all reciprocal
confidence, that we had none in his Minister (Thiers), and
that the national pride and vanity (of which we, like themselves,
had a share) were wounded by the ostentatious preparations
for war, and the menacing and blustering tone of
the press. He acknowledged these evils and their bad effects,
and only shrugged up his shoulders at what I said about
Thiers, of whom he has no good opinion himself, as is well
known.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_08_16" id="FN_08_16"></a><a href="#FNA_08_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a>
[Count Walewski had been despatched to Alexandria with a mission
from M. Thiers, and one of the grievances of Lord Palmerston against
France was that this emissary was supposed to have been sent either to encourage
Mehemet Ali in his resistance to the Allied Powers, or to negotiate
a separate arrangement between the Pasha and the Sultan, under the auspices
of France, so as to cut the ground from under the other Powers. This
M. Thiers stoutly denied in his correspondence, and he denied it to me with
equal energy when I dined with him at Auteuil on October 8.]</p></div>

<p>When I left him, I wrote a long letter to the Duke of
Bedford, detailing all that had passed, and as I cannot now
doubt that Lord John knows his brother communicates with
me, and it was of importance that he should be apprised
immediately of what had passed, I resolved to send him my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CONCILIATORY PROPOSALS.</span>
letter to read, and desired him to forward it to Woburn.
He afterwards dined with me, and when he came to dinner,
he said he had read my letter, and that it was very important.</p>

<h3>September 27th, 1840</h3>

<p>Went to Guizot, who began by telling
me he had been with Palmerston yesterday, who had
acknowledged <i>très loyalement</i> that there was not and could
not be any truth in the report (about Walewski), said
his manner to him (as it had always been) was excellent.
Guizot then complained of the facility with which he gave ear
to reports like these and to all that was said against France;
but he left him well enough satisfied with his reception.
He then asked in what state the question was, and I told
him that it was in such a state that I had no hesitation in
saying war was impossible, and that if the &lsquo;transaction&rsquo;
was such as we could in honour accept, we should accept it;
that the best thing to be hoped was, that Palmerston would
make up his mind to a &lsquo;<i>transaction</i>&rsquo; in the Cabinet, and
would himself take the initiative; but that at all events
there were others who were resolved not to pursue any
longer this course of policy, and that if he was inexorable
it must end in his resignation.</p>

<p>Before I went to Guizot I saw Clarendon, who had had
a good deal of talk with Lord John, who spoke to him just
in the strain which the Duke of Bedford had already described
to me. Melbourne is to be in town to-day, and what
Lord John expected and hoped was, that he would be able
to persuade Palmerston to give way, and himself propose to
acquiesce in Mehemet Ali&rsquo;s proposals. In that case, Lord
John said, he should not say a word. If Palmerston would
not do so, then it would be for him to take his own course,
and he and Clarendon have both agreed to resign if they
should be overruled; and the latter said he thought he
could answer for Lord Holland doing the same. While
returning home I was overtaken by Palmerston, who was on
his way to Lord John&rsquo;s house; and they are now closeted
together, so that at least they will have it all out before the
Cabinet to-morrow. Guizot gave me a copy of Cochelet&rsquo;s
despatch, with an account of what had passed between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Mehemet Ali, himself, Walewski, and the four Consuls-General,
which ended in the transmission of his new proposal
to the Porte.</p>

<h3>September 28th, 1840</h3>

<p>Lord John and Palmerston had a long
conversation, amicable enough in tone, but unsatisfactory in
result. However, Lord John did not appear to be shaken
in his determination, but rather inclined to an opinion that
Palmerston would himself be disposed to give way. Any
such expectation ought to have been dissipated by a letter
which Lord John received meanwhile from Palmerston, in
which he talked with his usual confidence and levity of &lsquo;the
certainty of success,&rsquo; the &lsquo;hopeless condition of the Pasha,&rsquo;
and the facility with which the Treaty would be carried into
effect.<a name="FNA_08_17" id="FNA_08_17"></a><a href="#FN_08_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_08_17" id="FN_08_17"></a><a href="#FNA_08_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a>
Everything turned out according to his anticipations.</p></div>

<p>In the morning, after I had been with Guizot (and
after Palmerston&rsquo;s interview with Lord John), he went to
Palmerston and communicated fully the offer of France, saying
he would not enter into the details of the question, but
he could not help reminding him of the failure of so many
of his confident expectations. Palmerston said that there
would be no sort of difficulty in enforcing the Treaty, and
that then France might join if she pleased. Guizot replied
that this was out of the question, that France was now
ready to join in a transaction fair and honourable to both
parties, but she would not stand by, see the question settled
without her, and then come in to bolster up an arrangement
made by others, and with which she had had no concern.
In the evening he went to Holland House, where he told
Melbourne what he had communicated to Palmerston; found
him in a satisfactory disposition, but Melbourne said that
there was a danger greatly to be feared, and that was, that
our ambassador at Constantinople, who was very violent
against Mehemet Ali, and not afraid of war, might and probably
would urge the immediate rejection of the Pacha&rsquo;s
proposal and every sort of violent
measure.<a name="FNA_08_18" id="FNA_08_18"></a><a href="#FN_08_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Guizot, naturally enough, expressed (to me) his astonishment that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD PALMERSTON&rsquo;S RESOLUTION.</span>
Prime Minister should hold such language, and that, if he
had an ambassador who was likely to act in such a manner
so much at variance with his political views, he did not
recall him or supersede him by a special mission. This,
however, was very characteristic of Melbourne; and I told
Clarendon, urging him to insist that some positive understanding
should be come to, upon the conduct to be adopted
by Ponsonby. There can be no doubt that Palmerston and
Ponsonby between them will do all they can to embroil
matters, and to make a <i>transaction</i> impossible, and Palmerston
writes just what he pleases without any of his colleagues
having the least idea what he says. The result of the whole
then is, that the Cabinet meet at three to-day, and that
Lord John will have to stand forth in opposition to Palmerston&rsquo;s
policy, and to propose the adoption of measures leading
to an amicable arrangement. A few hours will show
how the rest are disposed to take it.</p>

<h3>September 29th, 1840: Wednesday</h3>

<p>The Cabinet met on Monday
evening and sat till seven o&rsquo;clock. The account of the
proceedings which has reached me is to the last degree
amusing, but at the same time <i>pitoyable</i>. It must have been
<i>à payer les places</i> to see. They met, and as if all were conscious
of something unpleasant in prospect, and all shy, there
was for some time a dead silence. At length Melbourne,
trying to shuffle off the discussion, but aware that he must
say something, began: &lsquo;We must consider about the time
to which Parliament should be prorogued.&rsquo; Upon this Lord
John took it up and said, &lsquo;I presume we must consider
whether Parliament should be called together or not, because,
as matters are now going on, it seems to me that we may at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">A CABINET ON THE EASTERN QUESTION.</span>
any moment find ourselves at war, and it is high time to
consider the very serious state of affairs. I should like,&rsquo; he
added, turning to Melbourne, &lsquo;to know what is your opinion
upon the subject.&rsquo; Nothing, however, could be got from
Melbourne, and there was another long pause, which was
not broken till somebody asked Palmerston, &lsquo;What are your
last accounts?&rsquo; On this Palmerston pulled out of his pocket
a whole parcel of letters and reports from Ponsonby, Hodges,
and others, and began reading them through, in the middle
of which operation someone happened to look up, and perceived
Melbourne fast asleep in his armchair. At length
Palmerston got through his papers, when there was another
pause; and at last Lord John, finding that Melbourne would
not take the lead or say a word, went at once into the whole
subject. He stated both sides of the case with great precision,
and in an admirable, though very artful speech, a
statement which, if elaborated into a Parliamentary speech
and completed as it would be in the House of Commons,
was calculated to produce the greatest effect. He delivered
this, speaking for about a quarter of an hour, and then threw
himself back in his chair, waiting for what anybody else
would say. After some little talk, Palmerston delivered his
sentiments the other way, made a violent philippic against
France, talked of her weakness and want of preparation, of
the union of all the Powers of Europe against her, said that
Prussia had 200,000 men on the Rhine, and (as Lord Holland
said) exhibited all the violence of &rsquo;93. Lord John was then
asked, since such were his opinions, what course he would
advise? He said he had formed his opinion as to what it
would be advisable to do, and he produced a slip of paper on
which he had written two or three things. The first was,
that we should immediately make a communication to the
French Government, expressing our thanks for the efforts
France had made to induce the Pasha to make concessions
for the purpose of bringing about a settlement; and next, to
call together the Ministers of the other Powers, and express
to them our opinion that it would be desirable to re-open
negotiations for a settlement of the dispute in consequence of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
the effects produced by the mediation of France. There then
ensued a good deal of talk (in which, however, the Prime
Minister took no part), Lord Minto espousing Palmerston&rsquo;s
side, and saying (which was true enough), that though Lord
Holland and Clarendon, who had all along opposed the Treaty,
might very consistently take this course, he did not see how
any of those could do so who had originally supported and
approved of it; to which Lord John quietly and briefly said,
&lsquo;The events at Alexandria have made all the difference.&rsquo;
This was in fact no answer; and Minto was quite right,
especially as Lord John had taken his line before the events
at Alexandria were known. Of the Ministers present besides
Minto, Macaulay seemed rather disposed to go with Palmerston,
and talked blusteringly about France, as he probably
thought a Secretary of War should. Labouchere was first
one way and then the other, and neither the Chancellor nor
the Chancellor of the Exchequer said one word. The result
was an agreement, that it would be disrespectful to Lord
Lansdowne, considering his position, to come to any resolution
in his absence; and as he could not arrive before this day, that
the discussion should be adjourned till Thursday (to-morrow)
by which time he and Morpeth would be here. They were
all to dine with Palmerston, and a queer dinner it must
have been.</p>

<h3>October 1st, 1840</h3>

<p>No progress made, everything <i>in statu quo</i>.
The dinner at Palmerston&rsquo;s on Monday after the Cabinet,
went off well enough. In the evening Clarendon had a long
conversation with Lady Palmerston, who repeated to him
everything she had said to me, and seemed confident enough
that Palmerston would carry his point at last. He told
her, however, that if he persisted, the Government must be
broken up, as at least half a dozen would resign, and that
she must be aware Government could not go on if either
Palmerston or John Russell resigned (putting in Palmerston
out of civility). He thought he had made some impression
on her. The next day they all dined at Holland House.
There he had again some talk with Palmerston himself,
amicable enough, but leading to nothing; to what Clarendon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD JOHN&rsquo;S PACIFIC SENTIMENTS.</span>
said about breaking up the Government, Palmerston did not
reply a word. Afterwards Palmerston had a long talk with
Lord Holland, but not satisfactory. Morpeth has arrived,
and naturally enough was extremely embarrassed. He had
supported Palmerston originally, and was not aware of any
impending change of policy, or any change in anybody&rsquo;s
opinion, and he felt that it was an extraordinary whisk
round. Melbourne, of course, hopped off to Windsor the
moment the Cabinet was over, and instead of remaining
here, trying to conciliate people and arrange matters, he left
everything to shift for itself. Having shown the Queen a
letter of John Russell&rsquo;s, which she was not intended to see,
he sent to Lord John a letter of hers, which probably she
did not mean him to see either. She said, among other
things, that she thought it was rather hard that Lord
Palmerston and Lord John could not settle these matters
amicably, without introducing their own personal objects,
and raising such difficulties. She added one thing in her
letter which may lead to some important consequences. She
said that it was her wish that some attempt should be made
to open communications with the French Government. If
Palmerston chooses to give way, he may make her wishes
the pretext for doing so, and yield to them what he refuses
to everybody else.</p>

<p>I saw Guizot, who showed me a letter he had written to
Thiers, telling him as far as he knew how matters stood, of
the difficulties there were, and entreating him to moderate
the French press. He also showed me a note from John
Russell, in which, after thanking him for not speaking to him
at Holland House, as it was better he should only talk to
Palmerston or Melbourne, he added that he begged he would
not consider that the articles which had lately appeared
in the &lsquo;Morning Chronicle&rsquo; and &lsquo;Observer&rsquo; were approved
of by the Government, and repudiated any connexion or
concurrence with them. He had pronounced in the Cabinet
a violent philippic against the newspapers, which was entirely
directed at Palmerston, who, he knows very well, writes
constantly in them, and Guizot knows this also. Guizot, therefore,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
if he had any doubt before of Lord John&rsquo;s sentiments, can
have none now. An article appeared in the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; on Tuesday
strongly in favour of peace and harmony with France and the
acceptance of the Pasha&rsquo;s offers. Guizot, of course, was delighted
with it; but I found it had taken in other quarters, for
Dedel asked me if I had read it, and said it was the true
view of the question, and Ben Stanley said the same thing
to me at dinner, and that he had found at Manchester and
elsewhere a strong public opinion, of which he was sure
Palmerston was not aware, and would not believe in if told.
Dedel showed me a letter from Fagel, giving an account of a
conversation he had with Louis Philippe, in which the King
disclaimed any ambitious design or desire for war, but said
he was determined to put France in a respectable state of
preparation; very firm language. Dedel had been at Peel&rsquo;s,
but got nothing out of him except that he did not know
whether he should have made such a treaty, but as it was
made we ought to abide by it. The Tories will turn this
business to good account, end as it may; they have <i>beau jeu</i>.
But what Neumann said to Dedel is anything but confirmatory
of Palmerston&rsquo;s stories of Austrian <i>stoutness</i>, for he told
him it would be a very fortunate thing if the Sultan would
accept Mehemet Ali&rsquo;s new
proposals.<a name="FNA_09_01" id="FNA_09_01"></a><a href="#FN_09_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_09_01" id="FN_09_01"></a><a href="#FNA_09_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
[M. Neumann was the Austrian Minister in London; M. Fagel the
Dutch Minister in Paris.]</p></div>

<p><i>Evening.</i>&mdash;The Cabinet went off far better than could
have been expected; indeed, as well as possible under all the
circumstances. Lord John had previously intimated to
Melbourne that he should expect him to take the lead upon
this occasion, and it seems pretty clear that Melbourne had
contrived to effect some arrangement with Palmerston. Accordingly
Melbourne (very nervous) began, said that the
question was in the same state as when they last met, pronounced
a few commonplaces, such as that the success or
failure of the coercive means might by this time have been
proved, only they could not yet know the event, but ended
with referring to a paper delivered some time ago by Metternich,
in which he had made certain contingent suggestions,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PRINCE METTERNICH&rsquo;S SUGGESTION.</span>
of which the last and most important was, that in the event
of &lsquo;inefficacité des moyens&rsquo; becoming apparent some communication
should be made to France for the purpose of
drawing her again into the alliance (or something to that
effect; I cannot recollect the exact words, but it was a peg
on which a communication might be hung), and asking
Palmerston if he had not got this
paper.<a name="FNA_09_02" id="FNA_09_02"></a><a href="#FN_09_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Palmerston pulled
it, all cut and dry, out of his pocket and read it. A good
deal of talk then ensued, and some doubts and suspicions
were expressed about France, which drew out Lord Holland,
who said, &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, if you are so full of distrust of
France, if you suspect all her acts and all her words, put the
worst construction on all she does, and are resolved to be on
bad terms with her, call Parliament together, ask for men
and money, and fight it out with her manfully. Do this or
meet her in a friendly and conciliatory spirit, and cast aside
all those suspicions which make such bad blood between the
two countries.&rsquo; This appeal (of which I only give the spirit)
was very well received, and, after some more talk, Palmerston
said that though he was still convinced success would crown
the efforts now making in the East, and that it was unnecessary
to take any other step, yet, if it was the wish and opinion
of the Cabinet that some communication should be made to
France, he was ready to make it. This was, of course, very
well taken, and was a prodigious concession and change from
his former tone. A great deal more discussion then ensued,
and the result was that Palmerston is to see the Ministers of
the Conference, either separately or together, to-morrow, and
to propose to them that he should make a communication to
France on the basis of Metternich&rsquo;s suggestion. There can
be no doubt of Neumann&rsquo;s acquiescence, and the Prussian
will go with the Austrian; the only doubt is Brunnow.
They all agreed that nothing could be done but with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
common consent of all, and as Russia has behaved exceedingly
well since the signature of the Treaty, it would be
wholly unjustifiable not to treat her with perfect good faith
and every sort of consideration. If Brunnow objects, and
will not consent to the communication being made, another
Cabinet is to be summoned to-morrow afternoon; if he
acquiesces, Palmerston is to speak to Guizot immediately. If
Brunnow is not consenting, Palmerston will equally speak to
Guizot, but, instead of making a proposition, will say that
Brunnow will apply for instructions, and that we have requested
him to do so, to enable us, with the consent of all
the three parties to the treaty, to make the communication to
France. Such is the substance and result of this important
Cabinet, which I have very roughly and imperfectly put
down, and I am conscious that I have forgotten some of the
details which reached me; however, I have preserved the
essential parts. Lord John (to whom it is all due) said very
little, Lansdowne not much; Hobhouse was talkative, but
nobody listened to him; Melbourne, when it was over, swaggering
like any Bobadil, and talking about &lsquo;fellows being
frightened at their own shadows,&rsquo; and a deal of bravery
when he began to breathe freely from the danger.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_09_02" id="FN_09_02"></a><a href="#FNA_09_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
Metternich&rsquo;s paper was a suggestion which he put into the mouth of
the French Minister, and which he gave Leopold, who sent it here. He
said, &lsquo;If I were the French Minister, I would say so and so,&rsquo; to the effect
that if the means of coercion did not prove efficacious, the Allies had better
consider the matter afresh in conjunction with France, who would assist in
settling it.</p></div>

<h3>October 2nd, 1840</h3>

<p>Last night it was decided that Palmerston
should call the Conference together, and propose to them to
make a conciliatory advance to France. All Europe is looking
with anxiety for the result of the Cabinet held yesterday;
and this morning the &lsquo;Morning Chronicle&rsquo; puts forth an
article having every appearance of being written by Palmerston
himself (as I have no doubt it was), most violent,
declamatory, and insulting to France.</p>

<h3>October 4th, 1840</h3>

<p>I was obliged to break off, and now resume
the narrative. It was resolved at the Cabinet that Palmerston
should summon the Ministers of the Conference and
ask their consent to his making <i>some communication</i> to
Guizot. The Austrian and the Prussian said they would
consent to whatever Brunnow agreed to. Brunnow said he
could say nothing till he had consulted his Court; and he
added that England could do what she pleased, but that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD PALMERSTON DEFEATS CONCILIATION.</span>
would not conceal from Palmerston that the Emperor would
be exceedingly hurt if any step of the kind was taken without
his knowledge or
consent.<a name="FNA_09_04" id="FNA_09_04"></a><a href="#FN_09_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
On this the Cabinet again
met on Friday afternoon to hear the report; but it must
have been clear enough what the result of Palmerston&rsquo;s interview
with the Ministers would be, after the appearance of
the article in the &lsquo;Chronicle.&rsquo; I made the Duke of Bedford
go to Lord John and tell him this ought not to be endured;
and that if I were he I would not sit for one hour in the
Cabinet with a man who could agree to take a certain line
(with his colleagues) over night, and publish a furious attack
upon the same the next morning. Lord John said he had
already written to Melbourne about it, that Palmerston had
positively denied having anything to do with the &lsquo;Morning
Chronicle,&rsquo; and he did not see what more he could do; but
he owned that all his confidence in him was gone.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_09_04" id="FN_09_04"></a><a href="#FNA_09_04"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
[It is obvious that when Lord Palmerston agreed to make a conciliatory
overture to France, in order to allay the storm in the Cabinet, and prevent
the threatened dissolution of the Ministry, he was perfectly aware that
Brunnow and the Emperor of Russia would not concur in the proposal, or
would, at least, delay it so long that it would be useless. Moreover, Lord
Palmerston confidently relied, and in this it turned out he was right, on the
success of his naval measures against the Pasha, and of the Pasha&rsquo;s inability
to resist them. It was this prompt success&mdash;prompt beyond all conception
and belief&mdash;that averted the catastrophe of a dissolution of the Ministry or
a breach with France.]</p></div>

<p>I received a note in the morning from Guizot desiring to see
me, and I went. I told him that the article was abominable,
but that so far from its being a true exposition of the intentions
of the Cabinet, they had resolved upon the attempt at
conciliation which Palmerston had himself agreed to make.
I begged him to make allowance for the difficulties of the
case, and be contented with a small advance; and I told him
that the Cabinet were unanimously agreed upon the necessity
of adhering to their engagements with their Allies, and
at the same time endeavouring to bring about a <i>rapprochement</i>
to France. He promised to make the best of it with
his Government, and, making them comprehend that there
was a strong peace party in the Cabinet, work in conjunction
with that party here to keep matters quiet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
In the morning I went to Claremont for a Council, where
the principal Ministers met; and after the Council they held
a Cabinet in Melbourne&rsquo;s bed-room. It was not, however,
till this morning that I knew the subject of their discussion.
On arriving in town, indeed, I heard that Beyrout had been
bombarded and taken by the English fleet, and a body of
Turkish troops been landed; but this was not known at
Claremont, and not believed in London. Before I was dressed,
however, this morning, Guizot arrived at my house in a great
state of excitement, said it was useless our attempting to
manage matters in the sense of peace here while Ponsonby
was driving them to extremities at Constantinople, and
causing the Treaty to be executed <i>à l&rsquo;outrance</i>. He then
produced his whole budget of intelligence, being the bombardment
of Beyrout, the landing of 12,000 Turks, and the
deposition of Mehemet Ali and appointment of Izzar Pasha
to succeed him. He also showed me a letter from Thiers in
which he told him of all this, said he would not answer for
what might come of it, that he had had one meeting of the
Cabinet and should have another; but Guizot said he thought
he would very likely end by convoking the Chambers.</p>

<p>I went immediately to John Russell and told him what a
state Guizot was in, and showed him the papers. He said
they were aware yesterday of the Constantinople news; that
on receiving the propositions of the Pasha by Rifat Bey, the
Conference, considering them as a refusal, had immediately
proposed to Redschid Pasha to pronounce his
deposition;<a name="FNA_09_05" id="FNA_09_05"></a><a href="#FN_09_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
he agreed, and proposed to name a successor; they objected
to this, but ultimately consented to the appointment
of a provisional successor in the person of the Seraskier
commanding the Turkish troops in Syria; that it was not
intended really to deprive Mehemet Ali of Egypt, and the
sentence of deposition was only fulminated as a means of
intimidation, and to further the object of the treaty; Palmerston
wrote to Lord Granville, and desired him to make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD HOLLAND&rsquo;S VIEW OF THE CASE.</span>
an immediate communication to Thiers to this effect. Lord
John admitted that it was all very bad, but seemed to think
he could do nothing more, and that nothing was left but to
wait and to preach patience. I went from him to Guizot,
and told him what had passed; but he said, with truth,
that this resolution to drive matters to extremity, and to go
even beyond the Treaty, made it very difficult to do any
good here, and that the public would not be able to draw
those fine diplomatic lines and comprehend the difference
between a provisional and an actual successor to Mehemet
Ali. He was going to Palmerston, and I told him Palmerston
would no doubt tell him what had been conveyed to Lord
Granville.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_09_05" id="FN_09_05"></a><a href="#FNA_09_05"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
[The Conference of the Ambassadors of the Four Powers at Constantinople,
in which Lord Ponsonby played the most prominent part, and
laboured to drive matters to the last extremity.]</p></div>

<p>I then went to Holland House, found Lord Holland
alone, and he entered fully, and without reserve, into the
whole question. From him I learned that Metternich has
expressed his strong disapprobation of the violent steps that
have been taken, and that he wrote as much to Stürmer.
Holland seemed to think that there had been a great difference
of opinion among the Ministers of the Conference at
Constantinople, but that Ponsonby had ultimately prevailed
in persuading them to depose the Pasha; that he had concealed
the fact of the division of opinion which had been
revealed here by Lord Beauvale&rsquo;s letter from Vienna. Lord
Holland went over the whole case, and told me everything
that had occurred in great detail, the whole, or certainly the
greatest part, of which I was already apprised of. Just now
I saw Dedel, who told me again that Neumann had said to
him, &lsquo;Plût à Dieu que le Sultan acceptât les dernières propositions
de Mehemet Ali, car cela nous tirerait d&rsquo;un grand
embarras.&rsquo; Neumann is a time-serving dog, for he holds
quite different language to the Palmerstons, and to them
complains of Holland House, and talks of firmness, resolution,
&amp;c.</p>

<h3>October 7th, 1840</h3>

<p>Dined at Holland House on Sunday. Palmerstons,
John Russell, and Morpeth, all very merry, with
sundry jokes about Beyrout, and what not. At night Lady
Holland was plaintive to Palmerston about an article in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
&lsquo;Examiner,&rsquo; in which Fonblanque had said something about
Holland House taking a part against the foreign policy,
and they talked together amicably enough. Lady Palmerston
and I had another colloquy, much the same as before. I
told her what Neumann had said, but nothing would make
her believe it. They have a marvellous facility in believing
anything they wish, and disbelieving whatever they don&rsquo;t
like. In fact, Lord John evidently has completely knocked
under; he is unprepared to do anything more, and so ready
now to go on that he had himself proposed to Palmerston
that Stopford should be ordered to attack Acre. Of course,
Palmerston desired no better; and it seems to have been
agreed that conditional orders shall be sent to him&mdash;that is,
he is to attack if he is strong enough, and the season is not
too far advanced.</p>

<p>I dined again to-day at Holland House, and in the evening
Guizot came. He told me that nothing could be more
unsatisfactory than his interview with Palmerston; very
civil to himself personally as he always was, but &lsquo;de Ministre
à Ministre&rsquo; as bad as possible. He had told him of the
communication Lord Granville was desired to make to
Thiers, but had not said one syllable of the disposition of
the Cabinet to make an overture, nor held out the slightest
expectation of the possibility of any modification. Guizot
repeated how much he is alarmed, and talked of the probability
of war. It is now quite clear that Palmerston
has completely gained his point. The peace party in the
Cabinet are silenced, their efforts paralysed. In fact,
Palmerston has triumphed, and Lord John succumbed.
The Cabinet are again dispersed, Palmerston reigns without
let or hindrance at the Foreign Office. No attempt is
made to conciliate France; the war on the coast of Syria
will go on with redoubled vigour; Ponsonby will urge
matters to the last extremities at Constantinople; and
there is no longer a possibility of saying or doing any one
thing, for the whole question of reconciliation has been
suffered to rest upon the result of a communication which
Brunnow undertook to make to his Court, to which no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD PALMERSTON TRIUMPHS.</span>
answer can be received for several weeks, and none definite
will probably ever be received at all. Palmerston&rsquo;s policy,
therefore, will receive a complete trial, and its full and unimpeded
development, and even those of his colleagues who
are most opposed to it, and who are destitute of all confidence
in him, are compelled to go along with him his whole length,
share all his responsibility, and will, after all, very likely be
obliged to combat in Parliament the very same arguments
that they have employed in the Cabinet, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>Lord John has disappointed me; and when I contrast the
vigour of his original resolutions with the feebleness of his
subsequent efforts, the tameness with which he has submitted
to be overruled and thwarted, and to endure the treachery,
and almost the insult of Palmerston&rsquo;s newspaper tricks, I
am bound to acknowledge that he is not the man I took him
for. The fact is, that his position has been one of the
greatest embarrassment&mdash;but of embarrassment of his own
making. He consented to the Treaty of July, without due
consideration of the consequences it was almost sure to
entail. When those consequences burst upon him in a very
dangerous and alarming shape, he seems suddenly to have
awakened from his dream of security, and to have bestirred
himself to avert the impending evils; but while the magnitude
of the peril pressed him on one side, on the other he
was hampered by the consciousness of his own inconsistency,
and that he could not do anything without giving Palmerston
a good case against him. And when at last he did resolve
to take a decisive step, he never calculated upon the means
at his disposal to bring about the change of policy which he
advocated. He moved, accordingly, like a man in chains.
He distrusted Palmerston, and did not dare tell him so;
Melbourne would not help him; he dreaded a breach partly
official, partly domestic, with Palmerston, and only thought
of keeping the rickety machine of Government together as
long as possible, by any means he could, and was content to
leave the issues of peace or war to the chapter of accidents.
The rest of the Cabinet seem to have been pretty evenly
balanced, feeling (as was very natural) that they had no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
good case for opposing Palmerston, conscious that Lord John&rsquo;s
alarms were not without foundation, and that his position
gave him a right to take a decisive lead in the Cabinet;
still they were not inclined to act cordially and decisively
with him, and hence vacillation and uncertainty in their
councils. Palmerston alone was resolute; entrenched in a
strong position, with unity and determination of purpose,
quite unscrupulous, very artful, and in possession of the
Foreign Office, and therefore able to communicate in whatever
manner and with whomsoever he pleased, and to give
exactly the turn he chose to any negotiation or communication,
without the possibility of being controlled by any of his
colleagues. From the beginning, Lord John seems never to
have seen his way clearly, or to have been able to make up
his mind how to act. My own opinion is, that if there had
been a will, there might have been found a way, to do something;
but Palmerston had no such will. On the contrary,
he was resolved to defeat the intentions of his colleagues,
and he has effectually done so.</p>

<h3>October 8th, 1840</h3>

<p>Lord John Russell called on me yesterday
morning, more to talk the matter over than for any particular
purpose. He was, as usual, very calm about it all. I
told him all I thought, and asked him why Guizot&rsquo;s offer
had not been made use of; when he said that it had been
considered, but for three reasons, which he gave me, it had
been judged impossible to make it the foundation of a communication,
and that Metternich&rsquo;s paper had been taken
instead. Two of the reasons were, 1st. That the Viceroy&rsquo;s
offers would probably have been already rejected at Constantinople;
2ndly. That the insurrection in Syria would have
been organised, and it might entail consequences on the
Syrians that it would be unjust to expose them to; 3rdly.
The necessity of the previous concurrence of the Allies.
They all seemed to me very bad reasons.</p>

<p>I told him that Palmerston had gained his point, and
that the whole thing turned upon the success of the insurrection.
He admitted that it did, and stated the grounds there
were for hoping that it would succeed. He owned to me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD JOHN&rsquo;S LAST EFFORT.</span>
that his reason for consenting to the Treaty was the refusal
of France to join in coercive measures; which I told him
was in my opinion the strong point of Palmerston&rsquo;s case.
The fact is, the offer of France is come too late; the machine
has been set in motion, and now there is no stopping it.
But I shall ever think that if the advances of France had
been met in another way, much might have been done.
Lord John said the Queen had talked to him, and had expressed
her anxiety for some settlement, but at the same
time was quite determined to make no unworthy concession.</p>

<p>My brother writes me word that Lord Granville is so disgusted
at his position, and at being kept entirely in the dark
as to the real position of affairs, that he is seriously thinking
of resigning.
Bulwer<a name="FNA_09_06" id="FNA_09_06"></a><a href="#FN_09_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
has, however, done his utmost to
prevent him, and advised him to write instead and earnestly
recommend that, if they meditate any change, whatever they
mean to do should be done immediately.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_09_06" id="FN_09_06"></a><a href="#FNA_09_06"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
[Mr. Henry Bulwer (afterwards Lord Dalling) was at that time First
Secretary of the Embassy in Paris, and an ardent supporter of Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s
policy&mdash;much more so than the Ambassador, Lord Granville.]</p></div>

<p>I went to Lord John this morning, and read to him my
brother Henry&rsquo;s letter. He is alarmed, and says that no
doubt much might have been done in the way of conciliation
that has not been done; admits that Palmerston (through
whom everything must necessarily pass) will do nothing;
and that the fact is he does not believe in war, and does not
care if it happens. He showed me a paper he wrote with
the project of making certain tranquillising communications
to the French Government; one of which was, that if the
Allies resolved to attack Egypt, they would first give notice
to France and try and arrange matters with her. The
Emperor of Russia, it appears, is all for attacking Egypt;
but no intention exists of taking Egypt from the Pasha in
any case. I told him again that I thought an opportunity
had been lost of responding to the last offer of France in a
conciliatory way, and Lord John said he thought so too; he
had written a paper on the subject, showed it to Melbourne&mdash;who
highly approved of it, left it with him, never heard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
more about it, and nothing was done. Palmerston&rsquo;s extinguisher
was, of course, put upon it. Lord John said he was
tired of attempting to do anything; and he now appears to
have resolved to wait patiently, and meet his destiny with
the stoical resignation of a Turk.</p>

<h3>October 9th, 1840</h3>

<p>Everything looking black these last two
days, funds falling, and general alarm. Lord Granville has
written to Palmerston both publicly and privately; in the
former enforcing the necessity of some speedy arrangement,
if any there is to be; in the latter remonstrating upon his
own situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> of the Government. Lord John has
again screwed his courage up to summon the Cabinet, with
the determination of making another attempt at accommodation
with France. He proposed this to Melbourne, who
said &lsquo;it was too late.&rsquo; This is what he always does: entreats
people to <i>wait</i> when they first want to move, and then when
they have waited, and will wait no longer, he says, &lsquo;it is too
late.&rsquo; Lord John&rsquo;s design is to have a despatch written to
Granville, with which he is to go to Thiers, inviting a frank
explanation <i>de part et d&rsquo;autre</i>, asking what France desires
and expects, saying what England intends and does not intend,
entering into the position in which all parties are
placed, and expressing a readiness to conciliate France in
any way that we honourably and consistently can, communicating
to our Allies exactly what we say.</p>

<p>But what he would principally desire, and I perceive will
not be able to effect, is the supersession in some shape of
Lord Ponsonby, against whom grave charges do certainly lie.
The other day (the day before the Council at Claremont),
Palmerston produced at the Cabinet Ponsonby&rsquo;s despatch
announcing the deposition of Mehemet Ali, which he read
aloud. Melbourne asked if there was not something said
indicative of some differences of opinion among the Ambassadors
(probably something grave struck him), to which
Palmerston responded that there was nothing. The next
day Beauvale&rsquo;s despatch arrived with the report of the
Austrian Internuncio to Metternich, who said that Ponsonby
had assembled the Ministers at his house on Rifat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">NOTE FROM THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT.</span>
Bey&rsquo;s arrival, and proposed the immediate <i>déchéance</i> of the
Pasha, to which he had made no objection, but that his
Russian colleague had objected. His objections were, however,
overruled by Ponsonby, who had taken upon himself
to say that he would make England responsible for the
whole and sole execution of the sentence of deposition.
Nothing of this was hinted in Ponsonby&rsquo;s own despatch, and
the false account therefore which it conveyed of what had
passed raised a general and strong feeling of indignation.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I saw Guizot, whom I found very reasonable,
full of regret for the violence at Paris, and admitting
that it was not only mad but ridiculous; said he had urged
as forcibly as he could that they should do nothing for
several days, and pay no attention to any events that might
occur on the Syrian coast; that he had written to the Duc
de Broglie and entreated him to exert all his influence to
keep matters quiet; and then he said that he still did not
despair of peace if we would only do <i>something</i> to pacify and
conciliate France; that <i>some</i> concession in return for hers
she must have, and without which her Government had not
the power to maintain peace; that his conviction was, that
if we would give Mehemet Ali Candia, or a little more of
Syria&mdash;two out of the four Pashaliks&mdash;that this would be
accepted, and that surely the alliance and concurrence of
France were worth as much as this. I went from him to
John Russell, and told him what he had said.</p>

<h3>October 10th, 1840</h3>

<p>The Cabinet met this afternoon. Lord
John Russell was to have taken the lead and developed
his conciliatory notions, but a new turn was given to affairs
by a note which Guizot placed in Palmerston&rsquo;s hands just
before the Cabinet, which he only received from Paris this
morning.<a name="FNA_09_07" id="FNA_09_07"></a><a href="#FN_09_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
He called on Palmerston and gave it him; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
without any observations. Palmerston brought it to the
Cabinet, where it was read, and, to the extreme surprise of
everybody, it was to the last degree moderate, and evincing
a disposition to be very easily satisfied. This note is ill
written, ill put together, and very tame. What a difficult
task a French Minister must have, to defend at once such a
note and such an expense as had been incurred! Probably
Guizot did not much admire the production. The consequence
was that the discussion turned on this document,
and Palmerston immediately showed a disposition to haggle
and bargain, and make it a pretext for extorting from France
the best terms she could be got to yield, and all this in the
spirit of a pedlar rather than of a statesman. This was,
however, overruled. A better and more liberal disposition
pervaded the majority, and it was settled that Palmerston
should see Guizot and speak to him in a conciliatory tone,
and that a note, in a corresponding spirit, should be drawn
up and sent to the French Government. This note is, however,
to be first submitted for the approbation, and, if necessary,
alteration of the Cabinet, so that care will be taken
to make it what it ought to be. It would now appear that
the French Government would be well enough satisfied if
the original terms offered to Mehemet Ali were still held
out to him, and if it is made clear that he will in no
case be molested in the hereditary possession of Egypt; but
Palmerston began talking of leaving him Egypt <i>for his life</i>,
which was, however, instantly put down by the majority. A
more decided disposition appeared in the majority of the
Cabinet to adopt the conciliatory policy; whereas they exhibited
at the previous meetings rather a doubtful manner,
without, however, on any occasion saying much either way.
Palmerston displayed the same overweening confidence, and
the same desire to conceal whatever militated against his
opinion. Besides talking of the success they had already
obtained (which after all amounts to very little), he said he
had seen somebody, who had seen somebody else, who knew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RECEPTION OF THE FRENCH NOTE.</span>
that Louis Philippe was absolutely determined against war
under any circumstances. It turned out that there was a
despatch from Sir Charles Smith (between whom and Napier
there is some jealousy or misunderstanding), in which he
says that the position they occupy is of no use whatever,
but is purely defensive, and if Ibrahim does not attack the
Turks, and expose himself to a defeat, they can do nothing
against him. This, however, Palmerston held cheap, because
it did not square with his wishes. On the whole the result
was satisfactory; and if anybody but Palmerston was at
the Foreign Office, everything must be settled at once; but
he is so little to be trusted that there is always danger while
he is there.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_09_07" id="FN_09_07"></a><a href="#FNA_09_07"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
[This was the celebrated Note of which Thiers gave me a printed copy
when I dined with him on the 8th October at Auteuil. I came back to Paris,
sat up all night with a friend to translate it, and despatched it to England
next morning. My translation appeared in the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; on the same day
the Note was given to Lord Palmerston&mdash;which was another grievance. It
was a very lengthy document, recapitulating the whole conduct of France in
this affair, but ending in a very tame conclusion. Unfortunately Lord
Palmerston did not display the same moderation, and his Notes continued
to be as acrimonious as ever.&mdash;H.R.]</p></div>

<p>I went almost immediately to Guizot, and told him that
the reception of his note had given a new turn to the discussion,
but that it had given the greatest satisfaction, and
they were certainly not prepared for such a moderate communication.
He laughed, shrugged his shoulders, and said,
&lsquo;He should think they were not,&rsquo; any more than he was,
that nothing could equal his surprise at receiving it, that it
was very ill written, ill arranged, and he owned to me, in
confidence, that he thought it went even farther than it
ought; farther than he (much as he desired peace) could
ever have consented to go. He did not disguise from me,
and almost said in terms, that he thought it very discreditable,
and strikingly inconsistent with their previous language
and ostentatious preparations. I said that I could not
comprehend how such a note could emanate from the same
quarter as all the denunciations and threats we had lately
heard, and that though Thiers had, as everybody knew, a
great deal of <i>savoir faire</i>, he would have some difficulty in
defending both the note and the preparations. He seemed
by no means sorry at the idea of Thiers having got into a
scrape and dilemma, but not at all satisfied at the figure
which France is made to act in the affair, and not much
liking to play any part in the transaction. It is for this
reason that he gave Palmerston the note without any
remarks on its contents. When I asked him how it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
all to be accounted for, he told me that the truth was, it
was owing to the dissensions in the French Cabinet, and the
determination of the King; and that it was the only mode
by which an entire rupture in the Cabinet could be avoided.
He said, however, that he would have preferred the rupture
rather than a violent difference of opinion ending in such a
measure. (At least as I understood him, but I am not quite
clear as to his meaning on this point.) I told him that
Palmerston would see him, and would (or ought at least to)
speak to him in a very conciliatory tone; but that if he did
not do so, if he was wanting in any proper expression of the
sense of our Government of the conduct of that of France,
and if he evinced any disposition to haggle and drive a
bargain, he was not to believe that he expressed the sentiments
of the Cabinet, but merely gave utterance to his own.
We agreed that at all events the road to peace was
still open, and could hardly be missed. He said, it depended
on us, and only entreated that the communication we made
to the French Government might be full, cordial, and satisfactory,
giving them all the assurances they could require,
setting their minds at rest as to Egypt, and generally in a
tone as conciliatory and moderate as theirs to us. He
earnestly deprecated the idea of any bargaining, and said
that if Palmerston hinted at such a thing with him he must
make his proposals directly to Paris, for he would listen to
none such here. On the whole, he is well satisfied at the
prospect of the preservation of peace, but very much dissatisfied,
and even disgusted, at the manner in which this
consummation is likely to be brought about; conscious and
ashamed of the false position in which the Government of
France is placed, probably by their own conduct from the
beginning, but certainly by their violent and declamatory
language, so full of invective and menace, their expensive
and ostentatious preparations, and now their tame (and if
it were possible they could be afraid), pusillanimous conclusion.
He did not say a great deal, but what he did say was
with energy and strong feeling, and these I am certain are
his sentiments.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">POLICY OF LOUIS PHILIPPE.</span>
The real truth I take to be that the King is the cause
of the whole thing. With that wonderful sagacity which
renders him the ablest man in France, and enables him
sooner or later to carry all his points, and that tact and discernment
with which he knows when to yield and when to
stand, he allowed Thiers to have his fall swing; and to commit
himself with the nation, the King himself all the time
consenting to put the country in a formidable attitude, but
making no secret of his desire for peace; and then at the
decisive moment, when he found there was a division in the
Cabinet, throwing all his influence into the pacific scale, and
eventually reducing Thiers to the alternative of making a
very moderate overture or breaking up the Government.
The King in all probability knew that in the latter event
Thiers would no longer be so formidable, and that there
would be the same division in the party as in the Cabinet,
and that he should be able to turn the scale in the Chamber
in favour of peace. It is probable that His Majesty
looks beyond the present crisis, and sees in the transaction
the means of emancipating himself from the domination
of Thiers, and either getting rid of him, or, what would
probably be more convenient and safe, reducing him to a
dependence on himself.</p>

<h3>Livermere, October 17th, 1840</h3>

<p>All this week at Newmarket,
where I received regular information of all that went on.
Before I left town I saw Lord Holland and Lord John Russell.
The latter expressed himself better satisfied than he had
yet been, but was still doubtful how far Palmerston could
be trusted. Palmerston made no communication to Guizot,
and seemed resolved to interpose every delay, though everybody
kept on urging that something should be done without
loss of time. But he assured Melbourne that in a few days
we should hear of the total evacuation of Syria, and that
then we should be in a better condition to treat. His colleagues,
however, began to get alarmed at these delays, and
none more than Melbourne, who would not say or do anything
to accelerate Palmerston&rsquo;s movements, though he
acknowledged to others that, so far from partaking of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
confidence in the success of the operations in Syria, he
expected no good news from that quarter. Palmerston
went to Windsor, and there the Queen herself began to urge
him more strongly than she had ever done, for she hears
constantly from Leopold, who is mad with fright, and who
imparts all his fears to her. All this did at last produce
something, for there was a Cabinet the day before yesterday,
at which a despatch to Ponsonby was read, in which he was
desired to move the Sultan to reinstate the Pasha in the
hereditary government of Egypt, and this had been shown
to Guizot, who had expressed himself satisfied with it. This,
it may be hoped, will be sufficient, for the Note <i>requires</i> no
more than this, and it may be taken as an earnest of our
desire to meet the wishes of France. If it only produces
a pacific paragraph in the King&rsquo;s speech the crisis will be
over.</p>

<p>I do not quite understand how we can consistently send
such an instruction to our Ambassador <i>separately</i>. The
Sultan pronounced the deposition of Mehemet Ali by the
advice of the Four Powers (that is, by that of the four Ambassadors),
and I know not how we are entitled to do this
act rather than any other without the concurrence of the
rest. It was admitted that we could make no overture to
France, no pacific communication even, without the consent
of all. The Pasha has been solemnly deposed, all the Powers
advised this measure, and now we are alone and separately
recommending that he should be again restored to the
government of Egypt. Russia may not coincide in this
recommendation; his deposition from Egypt is now a part
of the Treaty. Whatever was the secret intention of the
parties, we are now
bound,<a name="FNA_09_08" id="FNA_09_08"></a><a href="#FN_09_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
if the Porte insists on it, to
exert all our power to expel the Pasha from Egypt as well
as from Syria. Such are the inconsistencies into which the
precipitate violence of Ponsonby has plunged us.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_09_08" id="FN_09_08"></a><a href="#FNA_09_08"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
It is held (though this seems a nice point) that we are <i>not</i> bound.</p></div>

<h3>Downham, October 23rd, 1840</h3>

<p>From Livermere to Riddlesworth
last Monday, and home to-day. This morning I learnt
(by reading it in the &lsquo;Globe&rsquo;) the sudden death of Lord
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DEATH OF LORD HOLLAND.</span>
Holland, after a few hours&rsquo; illness, whom I left not a fortnight
ago in his usual health, and likely to live many
years.<a name="FNA_09_09" id="FNA_09_09"></a><a href="#FN_09_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
There did not, probably, exist an individual whose loss will be more
sincerely lamented and severely felt than his. Never was popularity
so great and so general, and his death will produce a social
revolution, utterly extinguishing not only the most brilliant,
but the only great house of reception and constant society
in England. His marvellous social qualities, imperturbable
temper, unflagging vivacity and spirit, his inexhaustible fund
of anecdote, extensive information, sprightly wit, with universal
toleration and urbanity, inspired all who approached
him with the keenest taste for his company, and those who
lived with him in intimacy with the warmest regard for his
person. This event may be said with perfect truth to
&lsquo;eclipse the gaiety of nations,&rsquo; for besides being an irreparable
loss to the world at large, it turns adrift, as it were, the
innumerable <i>habitués</i> who, according to their different degrees
of intimacy, or the accidents of their social habits,
made Holland House their regular and constant resort. It
is impossible to overrate the privation, the blank, which it
will make to the old friends and associates, political and
personal, to whom Holland House has always been open like
a home, and there cannot be a sadder sight than to see the
curtain suddenly fall upon a scene so brilliant and apparently
prosperous, and the light which for nearly half a
century has adorned and cheered the world, thus suddenly
and for ever extinguished. Although I did not rank among
the old and intimate friends of Holland House, I came
among the first of the second class of those who were always
welcome, passed much of my time there, and have been continually
treated with the greatest cordiality and kindness,
and I partake largely and sincerely of the regret that must
be so deep and universal.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_09_09" id="FN_09_09"></a><a href="#FNA_09_09"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
Lord Holland said, just before he died, to the page, &lsquo;Edgar, these
Syrian affairs will be too much for me. Mehemet Ali will kill me.&rsquo;</p></div>

<h3>Downham, October 24th, 1840</h3>

<p>I have a letter from Clarendon
this morning from Windsor, overwhelmed with the news of
Lord Holland&rsquo;s death (which he had just received)</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0">&lsquo;when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
his mind was as vigorous and his perceptions as clear as
ever, and when his advice, and the weight of his experience,
were more necessary to his country than at any period of his
life. To myself I feel that the loss is irreparable. He was
the only one in the Cabinet with whom I had any real
sympathy, and upon the great question now in dispute I feel
almost powerless, for, with the anility of Melbourne, the
vacillation of John, and the indifference of all the rest,
Palmerston is now more completely master of the ground
than ever.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-indent: 0">He goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-indent: 0">&lsquo;Guizot came down here
last night; he goes to Paris on Sunday, to be present at the
opening of the Chambers, and to defend himself. More,
however, than that is in his mind, I am sure, and his feelings
towards Thiers are anything but friendly. Thiers, it seems,
means to put up Odillon Barrot (Guizot&rsquo;s favourite aversion)
for the presidency of the Chamber, and, it is said, to resign
if he is beaten. This, Guizot told me, was an inconceivable
<i>faiblesse</i>, or an unpardonable <i>légèreté</i>; but that whichever it
was, he should oppose it, and had written to tell the Duke
de Broglie so, in order that he might not be accused of
taking the Government by surprise. He said to me, &ldquo;<i>Donnez-moi
quelque chose à dire</i>, let it be ever so small, provided it
is satisfactory. I will impose it on Thiers, or break up his
administration; but unless I can have something of the
kind, and, above all, something wherewith to <i>resserrer les
liens entre les deux pays</i>, which is my great ambition, I shall
neither be able to <i>calmer les esprits</i> nor to take on myself the
government.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-indent: 0">He then goes on to say that Guizot tells
him&mdash;and his own letters confirm it&mdash;that the late <i>attentat</i> on
the King had made a much stronger impression, and excited
more alarm, than any former one, and he had proposed to
Melbourne to send a special ambassador to congratulate the
King on his escape, who should also be instructed to <i>peace-make</i>;
and suggested that the Duke of Bedford, Lord Spencer,
or himself, should go. Melbourne admitted it would be a
very good thing to establish some direct communication with
the King and Thiers, as well as the truth of all the reasons
by which he supported this proposal; but the following day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">M. GUIZOT SUCCEEDS M. THIERS.</span>
he came down with a whole host of petty objections, &lsquo;which
seemed to prevail in his perplexed and unserviceable mind.&rsquo;
The Duke of Bedford writes to me that he expects this state
of things will lead to a fresh combination of parties, and the
breaking-up of this Government.</p>

<p>This is what, in my opinion, it ought to lead to; for,
having now been behind the scenes for some time, I have
satisfied myself of the danger of the interests of such a
country as this being committed to such men as our Ministers.
How astonished the world would be!&mdash;even the bitterest and
most contemptuous of their political opponents&mdash;if they
could be apprised of all that has passed under my observation
during the last two months.</p>

<h3>Newmarket, October 27th, 1840</h3>

<p>At Downham laid up with the
gout, and now here. Heard of Thiers&rsquo; resignation on Sunday,
and nothing since; but Lady Palmerston writes me
word Guizot went to take leave of them in high spirits, and
that there was no doubt he would accept the Foreign Office.
Thiers had promised not to oppose the new
Government.<a name="FNA_09_10" id="FNA_09_10"></a><a href="#FN_09_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_09_10" id="FN_09_10"></a><a href="#FNA_09_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
[I breakfasted with M. Guizot at Hertford House on the 24th October,
having arrived in London on the 21st from Paris, where I had spent the
preceding fortnight, and had learned from Thiers, and other friends there,
the French side of these curious transactions. A courier arrived in London
on the morning of the 24th, bringing a letter from the King to M. Guizot,
which he showed me. It was written in his own bold hand, and contained
the words, &lsquo;Je compte sur vous, mon cher Ministre, pour m&rsquo;aider dans ma
lutte tenace contre l&rsquo;anarchie!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Whilst I was in Paris, where the greatest irritation and alarm prevailed,
my old friend and master, Count Rossi, retained his composure, and said to
me, tapping a sheet of paper as he spoke, &lsquo;When it comes to the Draft of
the Speech from the Throne to be delivered to the Chambers, this will break
up. The King will not consent to adopt Thiers&rsquo; warlike language.&rsquo; This is
exactly what occurred some ten days later. Rossi had a deeper insight into
political causes and events than any other man whom I have
known.&mdash;H. R.]</p></div>

<p>Guizot left London pretty well determined to take the
Government; and after some little discussion everything
was settled, and the new Cabinet proclaimed. The Press
instantly fell upon him with the greatest bitterness, and
the first impression was that he had no chance of standing,
but the last accounts held out a better prospect. I have
had no communication with him but a short note he wrote
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
me on his departure, expressing his regret not to have seen
me, and begging I would communicate with Bourqueney,
and let him call upon and converse with me. I wrote to
him yesterday a long letter, in which I told him how matters
stood here, and expressed my desire to know what we could
do that would be of use to him. In the meantime there has
been a fresh course of wrangling, and a fresh set of remonstrances
on the part of the peace advocates here, and lively
altercations, both by letter and <i>vivâ voce</i>, between Lord John
and Melbourne, and Lord John and Palmerston. Clarendon,
in a visit of six days at Windsor, worked away at the impenetrable
Viscount, and Lord Lansdowne battered him with
a stringent letter, pressing for the adoption of some immediate
measure of a pacific tendency; and in a conversation
which Clarendon had with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
he found him well inclined to the same policy, so that there
is an important section of the Cabinet disposed to take an
active part in this direction. But Palmerston at the same
time wrote to Melbourne in a tone of the greatest contempt
for all that was saying and doing in France, and, of course,
elated by the recent successes in Syria, which, with his usual
luck, have happened at this critical moment, and certainly
do appear to be
decisive.<a name="FNA_09_11" id="FNA_09_11"></a><a href="#FN_09_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_09_11" id="FN_09_11"></a><a href="#FNA_09_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>
[Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s object in all these critical discussions with his
colleagues had simply been to gain time for the operations in Syria against
the Pasha to take effect, for he had never ceased to maintain that they
would be completely successful, and in this, whether by superior information,
by clearer judgment, or by extreme good fortune, he proved to be in the
right, which ensured his ultimate triumph. But if there had been the
slightest failure, or check, or delay in any part of the operations, it must
have proved fatal to the Government.]</p></div>

<p>But just before the news came of the surrender of the
Emir Beschir, Lord John had taken up the question in a
much more serious and decisive tone than he ever did
before; and in correspondence with Melbourne, and <i>vivâ
voce</i> with Palmerston, had announced his determination to
quit the Government altogether. The occasion for this
vigorous outbreak was the arrival of a box of Foreign Office
papers, in which, besides some long rigmaroles of Metternich&rsquo;s,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD JOHN THREATENS TO RESIGN.</span>
there was a proposal (transmitted by Beauvale) for a
congress for the settlement of all disputes, together with
the draft of a short answer which Palmerston had written
and sent, declining the offer. This Lord John considered to
pass all endurance, no matter whether the congress was
advisable or not; but that such an important suggestion
should be received and rejected without any communication
of it to the other members of the Government, especially to
him who was their leader in the House of Commons, was so
outrageous that he was resolved not to pass it over, and he
accordingly wrote his opinion upon it to Melbourne in the
strongest terms, recommending him to transfer the lead of
the House of Commons to Palmerston, and to dispose of his
office as he pleased, as he would no longer go on; and he
said that though there must be a Cabinet in a few days to
settle about Parliament, he should not attend any more of
them. To this Melbourne wrote a curious answer, because
it was indicative of no approbation of, or confidence in, his
brother-in-law and colleague. He said he thought Lord
John had taken this up too strongly (he thinks everything is
too strong), but that he had sent his letter to Palmerston,
who would, no doubt, see him or write to him on the subject.
He then went on to say that he presumed Lord John had
well considered his determination, which would be, <i>ipso facto</i>,
the dissolution of the Government, as he would not consent
to carry it on with Palmerston as leader of the House of
Commons; that the retirement of Lord John, and the substitution
of Palmerston in such a post, would be such an
announcement to all Europe of the intentions of the British
Government to persevere in the extreme line of his policy,
that he could not for a moment contemplate such a thing.
Therefore, if Lord John persisted, the Government was at
an end. Shortly after, Palmerston called on Lord John.
He admitted that he had done wrong&mdash;that he ought to
have consulted him, and have made him privy to his answer,
but that he had attached so little importance to the proposal,
and had considered it so totally out of the question, that he
had replied offhand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
They then went into the question itself, when Palmerston
took that advantageous ground which he has always held
and asked him how he reconciled his present opinions with
his strenuous support of the Treaty itself, and complained
again of his acting as he had done, while success was attending
the coalition. They seem to have parted much as they
met, with mutual dissatisfaction, but without any quarrel.
Lord John, however, resolved upon action, and ultimately
determined to propose the recall of Ponsonby as the <i>sine quâ
non</i> of his continuance in office. The violence of these disputes,
and the peril in which the existence of the Government
seemed to be placed, brought Melbourne up to town,
and Lord John came to meet him, and imparted to him his
intentions. Just in the nick of time, however, arrived the
news of the Emir&rsquo;s flight, which seemed to be almost conclusive
of the Syrian question. On this, Palmerston took
courage, and, no longer insisting upon supporting Ponsonby
<i>à tort et à travers</i>, entreated that a damp might not be cast
upon the enterprise just as the final success was at hand;
and employed the argument <i>ad misericordiam</i> with regard to
Ponsonby by saying, that he would be entitled to a pension
if he was left there till December, and it would be hard to
recall him before that term was accomplished. Lord John
(never sufficiently firm of purpose) at last agreed to wait for
the receipt of the official accounts of recent events in Syria
which was expected in a few days, and to defer his demand
for Ponsonby&rsquo;s recall till then, and Palmerston seems to
have satisfied him that he is not at all desirous of quarrelling
with France. Indeed, Palmerston himself threw out, that
it might be expedient to find a provision for the family
of the Pasha, and render the grant of some appointments
to his sons instrumental to the settlement of the question.
There was a strange article, too, in the &lsquo;Morning Chronicle&rsquo;
the other day, which talked of the probability of Ibrahim&rsquo;s
being driven out of Northern Syria, and his entrenching
himself within the Pashalik of Acre, which would then
prevent the accomplishment of the Treaty of July. All this
looks as if Palmerston was beginning to think he was driving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD PALMERSTON DEFENDS LORD PONSONBY.</span>
matters too far, and that it was necessary to lower his tone
and modify his policy, unless he was prepared to retire from
office. At all events, Lord John was pacified for the moment
by this indication of more moderate intentions, and began
to hope better things for the future. To-morrow the Cabinet
is to meet again.</p>

<p>While all these wranglings are going on here, and nothing
is done, but a great deal contemplated, Bourqueney
presses for <i>something</i> on our part and keeps repeating that
every minute is precious. On the other hand, the Emperor
of Russia is highly satisfied with the state of things as it is,
and he intimated to Bloomfield that he should be extremely
indisposed to consent to any scheme for a fresh arrangement
in which France should participate, while our vague notion
is, that the coalition should fall to the ground as soon as its
object is attained, and that we should bring in France as a
party to some final settlement of the East, and dotation of
the sons of Mehemet Ali. In the meantime the Chambers
met yesterday, and all depends upon their proceedings.</p>

<h3>November 7th, 1840</h3>

<p>Lord Palmerston has written a long and
able letter, setting forth all the reasons why no special
mission should be sent to Constantinople, and why Ponsonby
should not be recalled; a skilful defence of Ponsonby showing
how right he had been about Syria; what unprecedented
influence he had obtained, having got both the Turkish fleet
and army placed under the command of Englishmen, and
how he had infused such spirit into the Turkish councils
that they had made exertions of which nobody thought they
were capable, and manifested a vigour it was not imagined
they possessed. This letter must have been a very good one,
for it entirely brought over Lord John to his opinion, and
even convinced Clarendon himself; and the former had
already written to Palmerston to say that he gave up his
demand for Ponsonby&rsquo;s recall. There is, however, still too
much reason to believe, that Palmerston is bent upon quarrelling
with France,<a name="FNA_09_12" id="FNA_09_12"></a><a href="#FN_09_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
and that he is now fighting to gain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
time in hopes of some commotion in Egypt itself, which
might lead to the complete ruin of the Pasha.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_09_12" id="FN_09_12"></a><a href="#FNA_09_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a>
[This was the real charge against Lord Palmerston and his policy, and
it is impossible to doubt that he was actuated in the whole of this affair,
not so much by a desire to support the Sultan and to ruin the Pasha of
Egypt, as by the passionate wish to humble France, and to revenge himself
on King Louis Philippe and his Ministers for their previous conduct in the
affairs of Spain. At this very moment, far from wishing to strengthen M.
Guizot in his efforts to maintain peace, Lord Palmerston addressed to him a
most offensive despatch, and published it, with a view to weaken and injure
the French Ministry.&mdash;H.R.]</p></div>

<p>This evening Bourqueney called on me, and brought me
a letter which he had received the day before from Guizot,
which I shall copy here.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">M. Guizot&rsquo;s Letter to Baron Bourqueney.</h3>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Mon Cher Baron</span>,&mdash;Le discours de la Couronne est
définitivement
arrêté. Je crois que vous le trouverez conforme à la vérité des
choses et aux convenances de la situation. Vous recevrez une circulaire
que j&rsquo;adresse à tous mes agents. J&rsquo;y ai essayé de marquer avec
précision l&rsquo;attitude que le Cabinet veut prendre et qu&rsquo;il gardera.
Mais ce ne sont là que des paroles: il faut des résultats. On les attend
du Cabinet. Il s&rsquo;est formé pour maintenir la paix, et pour trouver
aux embarras de la question d&rsquo;Orient quelque issue; pour vivre il
faut qu&rsquo;il satisfasse aux causes qui l&rsquo;ont fait naître. La difficulté est
extrême. L&rsquo;exaltation du pays n&rsquo;a pas diminué, la formation du
Cabinet donne aux amis de la paix plus de confiance, mais elle redouble
l&rsquo;ardeur des hommes qui poussent, ou qui se laissent pousser,
à la guerre; les malveillants et les rivaux exploiteront, fomenteront
les préjugés nationaux, les passions nationales. La lutte sera très-vive
et le péril toujours imminent. Je dirai la vérité. Je m&rsquo;applique
à éclaircir les esprits et à contenir les passions: je ne puis que
cela. Ce n&rsquo;est pas assez; pour que le succès vienne à la raison, il
faut qu&rsquo;on m&rsquo;aide. Deux sentiments sont ici en présence, le désir de
la paix et l&rsquo;honneur national. Je l&rsquo;ai souvent dit à Londres, je le
répète de Paris. Le sentiment de la France&mdash;je dis de la France,
et non pas des brouillons et des factions&mdash;est qu&rsquo;elle a été traitée
légèrement, qu&rsquo;on a sacrifié légèrement, sans motif suffisant, pour un
intérêt secondaire son alliance, son amitié, son concours. Là est le
grand mal qu&rsquo;a fait la Convention du 15 Juillet, là est le grand
obstacle à la politique et à la paix. Pour guérir ce mal, pour lever cet
obstacle, il faut prouver à la France qu&rsquo;elle se trompe, il faut lui
prouver qu&rsquo;on attache à son alliance, à son amitié, à son concours,
beaucoup de prix, assez de prix pour lui faire quelque sacrifice. Ce
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">M. GUIZOT&rsquo;S LETTER.</span>
n&rsquo;est pas l&rsquo;etendue, c&rsquo;est le fait même du sacrifice qui importe, qu&rsquo;indépendamment
de la Convention du 15 Juillet quelque chose soit
donné, évidemment donné, au désir de rentrer en bonne intelligence
avec la France, et de la voir rentier dans l&rsquo;affaire, la paix pourra
être maintenue et l&rsquo;harmonie générale rétablie en Europe. Si on
vous dit cela se peut, je suis prêt à faire les démarches nécessaires
pour atteindre à ce but, et à en accepter la responsabilité, mais je ne
veux pas me mettre en mouvement sans savoir si le but est possible
à atteindre. Si on vous dit que cela ne se peut pas, qu&rsquo;on entend
s&rsquo;en tenir rigoureusement aux premières stipulations du traité, et ne
rien accorder, ne rien faire qui soit pour la France une preuve qu&rsquo;on
désire se rapprocher d&rsquo;elle, pour le Cabinet une force dans la lutte
qu&rsquo;il a à soutenir, la situation restera violente et précaire, le Cabinet
se tiendra immobile, dans l&rsquo;isolement et l&rsquo;attente. Je ne réponds pas
de l&rsquo;avenir. Dites cela à Lord Palmerston, c&rsquo;est de lui que l&rsquo;issue
dépend. Il vous parlera de l&rsquo;état de la Syrie, de l&rsquo;insurrection du
Liban, des progrès que font les Alliés. Répondez simplement que
c&rsquo;est là pour la France une raison de se montrer plus facile à satisfaire,
mais que ce n&rsquo;est pas pour l&rsquo;Angleterre une raison de ne rien
faire en considération de la France. Je n&rsquo;ai encore rien dit, rien
écrit nulle part. J&rsquo;attends ce qu&rsquo;on vous dira à Londres....</p></blockquote>

<p>Nothing can be better, more serious, or better calculated to
produce an effect, if anything can, upon our impenetrable
Cabinet. Bourqueney showed it in the first instance to
Melbourne, who told him to show it to Palmerston; but he
said he had scruples in doing that lest Palmerston should
make him an answer calculated to exclude all hope of accommodation;
but Melbourne hinted that he would take
care of this, and accordingly he took it to Palmerston this
morning. He read it, said it was very moderate, and praised
the tone and language. But when Bourqueney began to ask
what he had to say to the <i>fond</i>, he only talked of the practical
difficulties, and ended without saying anything the
least promising or satisfactory, though nothing decidedly
the reverse. Bourqueney had previously been with Billow,
who is just come back, and who desires no better on the
part of his Government than to join in any conciliatory
measure we may adopt; and Esterhazy, who is expected
every hour, will, he doubts not, be equally well disposed.
But although such is the disposition both of Austria and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Prussia, though the Queen is earnestly desirous of seeing
tranquillity and security restored, and almost all, if not
quite all, the Cabinet, are in favour of an accommodation
with France, and France herself is prepared to accept
the slightest advance offered in a conciliatory spirit, the
personal determination of Palmerston will probably predominate
over all these opinions and inclinations. He will put
down or adjourn every proposal that is made, and if any
should be adopted in spite of him, he will take care to mar
it in the execution, to remove no difficulties, and create them
where they don&rsquo;t already exist. The most extraordinary part
of the whole affair is, that a set of men should consent to
go on with another in whom they have not only no confidence,
but whom they believe to be politically dishonest
and treacherous, and that they should keep gravely discussing
the adoption of measures with a full conviction that he
will not fairly carry them out. It is like Jonathan Wild
and his companions playing together in Newgate. I understand
the last decision of the Cabinet is that Guizot is to
be invited to say what would suit his case. There would be
a difficulty in specifying what concessions we should make,
either for Mehemet Ali or his sons, because events are proceeding
rapidly in Syria, and we <i>might be</i> offering what we
have already restored to the Sultan, and what the Porte has
assisted to recover for itself. It is settled that all this shall
be fairly stated to Guizot, with an assurance that we are
desirous of assisting him, together with our willingness to
concert with him the means. This may do, if honestly and
truly carried out.</p>

<h3>Friday, November 13th, 1840</h3>

<p>The day before yesterday Bourqueney
called on me, and brought me a letter from Guizot
in reply to the one I had written him. He then proceeded
to tell me all that had occurred since I had before seen him,
and to this effect: On Saturday the Cabinet had resolved
upon an invitation to Guizot to announce his wishes and
ideas, and proposed a frank explanation <i>de part et d&rsquo;autre</i> on
the whole question. On Sunday, Palmerston communicated
this to Bourqueney, and very faithfully. On Sunday or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">TERMS OF CONCILIATION.</span>
Monday arrived a despatch from Metternich, first of all confirming
Neumann as sole Minister to the Conference, and
secondly announcing that any concession in Syria was <i>now</i>
quite out of the question. This he told Bourqueney, and
conveyed to Palmerston, to whom it was a great accession of
force, and by this the disposition of Austria, and with it that
of Bülow, became entirely changed, and very unfavourable to
any transaction. On Monday morning Bourqueney received
a letter from Guizot saying that he had had a conference
with Lord Granville, to whom he had suggested various
alternatives for a settlement on the basis of a concession,
which Granville was by the same post to transmit to Palmerston,
and he at the same time told Bourqueney what they
were: Egypt hereditary, St. Jean d&rsquo;Acre for life, and either
Tripoli or Candia for one of his sons; or the hereditary
Pashalik of Acre instead. On Monday night Bourqueney
met Palmerston at dinner at the Mansion House, when he
said to him, &lsquo;You have heard from Lord Granville, and he
has transmitted to you M. Guizot&rsquo;s proposals (or suggestions).&rsquo;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Palmerston, &lsquo;I have heard from Lord Granville,
but he sent me nothing specific on the part of Guizot. But
come to Lady Palmerston&rsquo;s to-night from hence, and we will
talk it over.&rsquo; He went there, and Palmerston read to him a
long despatch from Granville, but which, to his surprise, did
not contain any of the specific propositions which Guizot had
notified to him, and, conceiving that Granville must have
certain good reasons for this reticence, he resolved to say
nothing of them either, and confined himself to mere general
inquiries as to what could be done, to which he obtained no
satisfactory reply, not a hope being held out of any concession.
In this condition of affairs he came to me to tell me what passed
and consult me as to the future. I told him that though there
was the same desire for a reconciliation with France, and the
same anxiety to assist M. Guizot on the part of my friends,
when they came to consider what was possible and would be
safe and justifiable, they were unable to find any expedient
to meet the immense practical difficulties of the case; that
events had proceeded with such celerity, and placed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
question in so different a position, that concessions formerly
contemplated as reasonable and possible were now out of the
question. They all felt that they could offer nothing in
Syria; that it was possible the Sultan might be actually in
possession of any town or territory at the moment they were
offering it, and that now justice to the people, honour and
fidelity to our allies, especially to the Sultan himself, forbade
us to make any concession whatever in that quarter. Bourqueney
did not deny the force of this, but he said Guizot
was sanguine as to the acceptance of some such terms as he
had suggested, and it was of the last importance he should
be undeceived, and made acquainted with the real truth, and
know what he had to rely on. He said he would write, but
he entreated me to write to him too, and to tell him the substance
of what I had imparted to him. Accordingly I did write
to Guizot at great length, setting forth in terms as strong as
I could, and without any disguise, the difficulties of the case,
and the utter unreasonableness of the French public in requiring,
as a salve to their vanity, terms which we could
neither in good policy or good faith concede. We both
agreed that under existing circumstances it was not desirable
that Guizot should make any proposal to our Government,
and so we both of us told him. Such was the result of a
conversation which when reported to Guizot will be a bitter
disappointment to him; but I concur with the rest, that we
could not now make any of the concessions he was disposed
to ask. Bourqueney suggested that if the chances of war
should be hereafter favourable to the Pasha, if the Allies
should make no impression upon Acre or the south-west part
of Syria, then possibly some transaction on such a basis
might be possible. This, however, it was useless to discuss.
Yesterday I saw Dedel, who has lately been at Walmer, and
he told me the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s opinion exactly coincided
with ours, coincided both as to the impossibility of our
making any concession in Syria, and to its perfect inutility
if we did. We might degrade ourselves, weaken our own
cause, but we should neither strengthen Guizot nor satisfy
the cravings of French vanity and insolence, still less silence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD PALMERSTON&rsquo;S IRRITATING LANGUAGE.</span>
that revolutionary spirit which, not strong enough in itself,
seeks to become formidable by stimulating the passions and
allying itself with all the vanity, pride, and restlessness,
besides desire for plunder, which are largely scattered
throughout the country.</p>

<p>It is curious that Austria, hitherto so timid, should all of
a sudden become so bold, for besides this notification to
Neumann, Metternich has said that, though we have instructed
Ponsonby to move the Sultan to restore Mehemet
Ali to Egypt, he has not given the same instructions to
Stürmer, and that he wants to see the progress of events and
the conduct of the Pasha before he does so.</p>

<p>Events have so befriended Palmerston that he is now in
the right, and has got his colleagues with him; but where
he is and always has been wrong is in his neglect of forms;
the more <i>fortiter</i> he is <i>in re</i>, the more <i>suaviter</i> he ought to be
<i>in modo</i>. But while defending his policy or attacking that
of France, he has never said what he might have done to
conciliate, to soften, and to destroy those impressions of
intended affronts and secret designs which have produced
such violent effects on the French public. On the contrary,
he has constantly, in his State papers, and still more in his
newspapers, said what is calculated to irritate and provoke
them to the greatest degree; but Dedel says this has always
been his fault, in all times and in all his diplomatic dealings,
and this is the reason he is so detested by all the Corps
Diplomatique, and has made such enemies all over Europe.
Guizot will now be cast on his own resources, and must try
whether the language of truth and reason will be listened to
in France; whether he can, by plain statements of facts, and
reasonable deductions therefrom, dissipate those senseless
prejudices and extravagant delusions which have excited
such a tempest in the public mind. It is clear enough to me
that if he cannot, if vanity and resentment are too strong for
sober reason and sound policy, no concessions we could make
would save him from downfall, or save Europe from the consequences
of this moral deluge.</p>

<h3>November 15th, 1840</h3>

<p>Two days ago, Lord John Russell called
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
on me. We had some talk, but nothing very conclusive. He
said the operations in Syria could not go on much longer,
and we are threatened with the greatest of all evils, the
hanging over of the question for another year. This he
thought the worst thing of all. It is curious that he told me
Stopford wrote word he must send his ships into port, and all
the authorities, military and naval, say nothing can be done
after the 20th. Palmerston keeps telling Bourqueney they
can go on all the winter, and that the operations will not be
suspended at all. I asked Lord John, if the campaign did
close, leaving the Pasha in possession of all the south-west
of Syria from Damascus to the Desert, and Acre unattacked,
whether on such a status an agreement could not be concluded,
terminating the contest by the concession of the
original terms of the treaty. He said Melbourne would like
that very well, but that there would be difficulties, and
France would not come into the treaty on those terms. I
told him I was pretty sure France would, though I did not
tell him what had passed between Bourqueney and me.
However, I sent for Bourqueney, and told him to propose
nothing new, but to wait till the campaign was over, and in
the meantime to prepare the way for some specific proposition
which France might make in a spirit of amicable intervention
to put an end to the contest.</p>

<h3>December 4th, 1840</h3>

<p>In the course of the last three weeks, and
since I last wrote, a mighty change has taken place; we
have had the capture of St. Jean d&rsquo;Acre and the debate in
the French
Chambers.<a name="FNA_09_13" id="FNA_09_13"></a><a href="#FN_09_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Palmerston is triumphant; everything
has turned out well for him. He is justified by the
success of his operations and by the revelations in the
speeches of Thiers and Rémusat. So, at least, the world
will consider it, which does not examine deeply and compare
curiously in order to form its judgements; and it must be
acknowledged that he has a fair right to plume himself on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DEBATE IN THE FRENCH CHAMBER.</span>
his success. His colleagues have nothing more to say; and
as Guizot makes a sort of common cause with him in the
Chamber, and Thiers makes out a case for himself by declaring
objects and designs which justify Palmerston&rsquo;s policy
and acts, and as the Pasha is now reduced to the necessity
of submission, the contest is at an end. Guizot continued
up to the eve of the discussion to press us to do or say something
to assist him; but when he found we could or would
do nothing, he took the only line that was left him, and the
best after all, and threw himself on the sense and reason of
the country. He told the truth, and justified himself by
vindicating us. He has done very well, and shown himself
a good debater; but the discussion has been disgracefully
personal, and with all the talent displayed they have not an
idea how a deliberating assembly ought to conduct its debates,
and the disclosures and revelations of official secrecy
and confidence have been monstrous. Thiers has all along
been playing a false, shuffling, tricky part, and at last he
got so entangled in the meshes of his own policy, and so
confused by the consequences of his double dealing, that he
evidently did not know what to do; and the King had no
difficulty in getting him out of a Government that he could
no longer conduct. He says now that he meant to make
war by and by; but though these menaces and the reasons
he gives afford Palmerston his best justification, and are
appealed to triumphantly by him and his friends, my own
conviction is that Thiers would gladly have closed the
account by a transaction, and that <i>at last</i> he would have
come into the Treaty&mdash;if Palmerston would have let him in&mdash;upon
terms much worse for the Pasha than those to which
he would not have consented before July. Nothing that has
occurred shakes my conviction that Palmerston was very
wrong not to endeavour to bring France into the Treaty and
to offer the <i>status quo</i>, though it is very possible France
would have refused it. If the French Government were on
the one hand resolved to agree to nothing, and under no
circumstances to join in coercing the Pasha, Palmerston on
the other was as obstinately determined to settle the business
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
his own way, and not to make any proposal to France which
she would or could accept. They both stood aloof, and both
were immensely to blame. Palmerston has taken his success
without any appearance of triumph or a desire to boast over
those who doubted or opposed him; whatever may be said
or thought of his policy, it is impossible not to do justice to
the vigour of his execution. Mr. Pitt (Chatham) could not
have manifested more decision and resource. He would not
hear of delays and difficulties, sent out peremptory orders to
attack Acre, and he provided in his instructions with great
care and foresight for every contingency. There can be no
doubt that it was the capture of Acre which decided the
campaign; and the success is much more attributable to
Palmerston than to our naval and military commanders, and
probably solely to him.</p>

[The bombardment and capture of St. Jean d&rsquo;Acre by the allied fleet
took place on the 3rd November, whilst these diplomatic troubles were
going on in London and Paris. The French Chambers opened on the 6th
November.]</p></div>

<p>Yesterday I saw the Baron Mounier, who is come over
here, on a sort of mission, to talk about possible arrangements,
from Guizot. He still pertinaciously urges our doing
or saying something demonstrative of a disposition to be reconciled
with France, and that, in the ultimate settlement of
the Eastern Question, we wish to show her some deference.
He wants (Syria being gone) that we should make out that
it is from consideration for France that Egypt is left to the
Pasha. I told him the only difficulty appeared to be that,
as we had already announced we had no intention to strip
him of Egypt, and had signified long ago that we had advised
the Sultan to restore him to that Government, I did
not see how we could now make any such declaration available,
and that it would go for nothing. But he said he
thought by a not difficult employment of diplomatic phraseology
much might be done; and he suggested that there
must be some definite settlement of the whole question, including
stipulations and guarantees for the Syrian population
(of the mountains, I presume), and to this France might
be invited to accede. In short, nothing will satisfy her but
having a finger in the pie upon any terms. What Guizot
now wants is to renew the English alliance. So he said
when he went away; but it may well be doubted whether
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD MELBOURNE IN HIGH SPIRITS.</span>
the French are not too sulky with us and too deeply mortified
not to make this an unpopular attempt just now.
Mounier is the son of Mounier the Constitutionalist, entirely
in Guizot&rsquo;s confidence, a talkative man not seemingly brilliant,
but he is well versed in affairs, an active member of
the Chamber of Peers, and considered indispensable there as
a <i>rédacteur</i> and transactor of Parliamentary business.</p>

<h3>December 13th, 1840</h3>

<p>For the last week at Norman Court,
during which little or nothing has happened; but I heard
one or two things before I left town. Guizot had made a
direct application to Palmerston for his permission to attribute
the leaving of Egypt to Mehemet Ali, to the influence
of France, and to a desire to gratify her. This Palmerston
(through Lord Granville) refused; but Guizot had not waited
for the answer, and in his speech he said so, and it was not
without its use. But while everything was on the point of
being settled, Metternich (who is always in hot or cold fits
of courage or cowardice) sends over a proposal that Egypt
shall only be granted to Mehemet Ali for his own and his
son&rsquo;s lives, and not hereditary. For what possible reason
this absurd proposition was made, unless to create embarrassment
and rekindle animosities, nobody can conceive; though
probably the real solution is that Metternich is in his dotage,
has no policy in his brain, and acts from foolish impulses.
I have heard no more of it; and though Palmerston would
not be at all averse to the proposal as a matter of inclination,
I do not suspect him of the folly of listening to it, and,
if he did, his colleagues would not.</p>

<h3>December 29th, 1840</h3>

<p>Went on Thursday last to the Grange,
and returned yesterday. Just before I went, the Duke of
Bedford called on me; he was just come from Woburn,
where he had had a great party&mdash;Melbourne, like a boy
escaped from school, in roaring spirits. They anticipate an
easy session, and all Melbourne&rsquo;s alarm and despondency are
quickly succeeded by joy at having got out of a scrape, and
confidence that all difficulties are surmounted and all opposition
will be silenced. But it now comes out that of all
who were opposed to Palmerston&rsquo;s policy, not one&mdash;not even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Lord Holland&mdash;was <i>in his heart</i> so averse to, and so afraid
of it, as Melbourne himself; and, nevertheless, he would
say nothing and do nothing to impede or alter it. Palmerston
is now doing his best to flatter Lord John out of any
remains of sourness or soreness that their recent disputes
may have left in his mind; and (passing over all that subsequently
occurred) he writes to him to invite him to Broadlands,
and says that while their recent successes have far
exceeded the most sanguine expectations, he never shall forget
how much of them is owing to the powerful support
which he (Lord John) gave to him (Palmerston) in the
<i>Treaty</i>. There is, it must be owned, astuteness in this; for
Lord John&rsquo;s original support of the Treaty, and Palmerston&rsquo;s
success in the operations, bind them indissolubly together,
and it is very wise to put this prominently forward and
cancel the recollection of all the rest.</p>

<p>But while public opinion appears to be universally pronounced
in Palmerston&rsquo;s favour, and the concurrent applause
of all the Tory papers indicates the satisfaction of that party,
some circumstances lead me to believe that their approbation
of the Treaty of July, and of all Palmerston&rsquo;s proceedings
under it, is by no means so certain as the Government
believe. At the Grange I found Lord Ashburton loud in
his condemnation of the whole thing, talking exactly as we
have all been talking and writing for many weeks past; and
what surprised me much more was, that, in a conversation
which I had with Granville Somerset yesterday, he expressed
precisely the same opinions; and when I expressed my
surprise at his language, and said that I had fancied all the
Tories were enraptured with Palmerston, he replied that he
had no reason to believe any such thing; that he had not
met (among the many with whom he had conversed) with
any such general and unqualified approbation; and he
believed both the Duke and Peel had carefully abstained
from pronouncing any opinion whatever on the subject,
leaving themselves entire liberty to deal with the whole
question as they might think fit. The notion is, that the
Tories are charmed with a transaction which separates us
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">TORY OPINION OF LORD PALMERSTON&rsquo;S POLICY.</span>
from France, but Lord Ashburton and Granville Somerset&mdash;a
bigoted Tory, if ever there was one&mdash;inveighed against the
Treaty precisely because it had produced that consequence.
It is the approbation expressed by Aberdeen, both before and
since our successes, which has led to the general belief that the
Tories are with the Government on this matter, for Aberdeen
is regarded as their mouthpiece upon all questions of foreign
policy. I had another conversation with Mounier just before
he went. He had been to Strathfieldsaye, and was delighted
with his reception by the Duke, and with the tone and tenor
of his talk, anxious for a reconciliation with France, and
entering into the whole history of our mutual relations from
the Restoration to the present day, as he said, with the
greatest clearness, precision, and solidity. He admitted
that Guizot&rsquo;s was a very difficult situation, and the restoration
of amicable feelings between the two countries very
difficult also, but a thing earnestly to be desired.</p>

<h3>December 31st, 1840</h3>

<p>The end of the year is a point from
which, as from a sort of eminence, one looks back over the
past, happy if the prospect is not gloomy, and if the retrospect
carries with it no feelings of regret and self-reproach.
The past year has been full (as what year is not?) of events,
of which that which has made the deepest impression on
society is the death of Lord Holland. I doubt, from all I see,
whether anybody (except his own family, including Allen) had
really a very warm affection for Lord Holland, and the reason
probably is that he had none for anybody. He was a man with
an inexhaustible good humour, and an ever-flowing nature,
but not of strong feelings; and there are men whose society
is always enjoyed but who never inspire deep and strong attachment.
I remember to have heard good observers say that
Lady Holland had more feeling than Lord Holland&mdash;would
regret with livelier grief the loss of a friend than this equable
philosopher was capable of feeling. The truth is social qualities&mdash;merely
social and intellectual&mdash;are not those which inspire
affection. A man may be steeped in faults and vices,
nay, in odious qualities, and yet be the object of passionate
attachment, if he is only what the Italians term &lsquo;<i>simpatico</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>January 7th, 1841</h3>

<p>Yesterday arrived (through the
French telegraph) the news of the death of the King of
Lahore, the surrender of Dost Mahomed, and the settlement
of the Chinese quarrel, all coming just in time to swell out
the catalogue of successes to be announced in the Queen&rsquo;s
Speech. In France the aspect of affairs is improving, the
King has given answers on New Year&rsquo;s Day which he
would not have ventured to make a short time ago, and
His Majesty assures Lord Granville that the war fever is
rapidly diminishing. The French hardly trouble themselves
now (except in an occasional undergrowl in some Liberal
paper) about Syria, and the Government considering Mehemet
Ali&rsquo;s destiny decided, only desire to be re-admitted into the
great European Council, for the purpose of participating in
the measures to be adopted for determining the condition of
the Christian population of Syria, and for securing Constantinople
from any exclusive protection or influence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD PONSONBY&rsquo;S VIOLENCE.</span>
At this moment, however, everything is unsettled with
regard to Egypt, and Lord Ponsonby has been acting in his
usual furious style with such effect that it is not at all
certain the question will be settled without a good deal of
trouble. Upon the receipt, at Constantinople, of Napier&rsquo;s
unauthorised Convention with the Pasha, Ponsonby instantly
assembled the ambassadors, moved that it should be rejected
and disavowed, and signified the same to the Ministers of
the Porte, who, of course, desired no better than to acquiesce.
At Ponsonby&rsquo;s instigation, Redschid Pasha wrote to say
that the Sultan utterly disavowed this Convention; that he
might be disposed, out of deference to his allies, and at their
request, to grant some temporary favour and indulgence to
the family of the Pasha, but as to the hereditary possession
of Egypt, <i>he had never heard of</i>, or contemplated, any such
thing, nor would ever listen to it; and he reminded the
Allied Powers that such a grant would be in direct contravention
of the principle of the Treaty itself, which had for
its object the maintenance of the integrity of the Ottoman
Empire. It remains to be seen what will be done at Constantinople
when the intelligence of Stopford&rsquo;s Convention
(so to call it) arrives there, which, in fact, differs in no
respect from that of Napier; but it is very extraordinary
that Ponsonby should write word that the Sultan had never
<i>heard</i> any question of the hereditary grant of Egypt, when,
in the middle of October, a despatch was written to him
(which was at the same time communicated to the French
Government) ordering him to propose to the Sultan this
restitution. Unless, therefore, this despatch was not sent,
or he took upon himself to disobey his instruction, it must
be false that the Turkish Government never heard of such
a question. Lord John Russell, who went to Broadlands
the other day, wrote to Melbourne that he found Bülow,
Neumann, and Esterhazy there, and there seemed to be a
great deal of discussion going on between them all, and
much doubt as to the question of <i>hérédité</i>, but that he was of
opinion that this question admitted of no doubt, and that
we were bound to insist upon it after the assurances we had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
given to France. Of Palmerston&rsquo;s opinions he did not say
a word. However, whether Palmerston wishes to push
matters to further extremities against the Viceroy or not, he
will hardly attempt it, for, easy as he has hitherto found it,
with the opportune aid of events, to baffle all opposition in
the Cabinet, he would certainly meet with a resistance to
any such design that he would not be able to overcome. His
successes have not made him more moderate and conciliatory
towards France, and I have no doubt that if he had the
drawing up of the Queen&rsquo;s Speech, he would take an insulting
and triumphant tone in it, which would fan the expiring
flame of passion and hostility, and widen the breach between
the two countries.</p>

<p>The other day Lord Clarendon wrote to him, sending a
sort of message from the French Court (through Madame de
Montjoie) expressive of a hope that a conciliatory disposition
would prevail; to which he responded in a strain of insolent
invective against France and her designs, saying that her
object was to extort concessions from us which we should
never make, and that now we were strong in our alliance
with the other Powers we might defy her to injure us.
This letter Clarendon showed to Melbourne, who had asked
him if he knew what Palmerston&rsquo;s feelings were (he himself
knowing nothing), and he was, of course, struck with the
bitterness and asperity of his tone. Melbourne told Clarendon
that Palmerston was still very sore at the articles which had
appeared in the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; and at the communications that
had taken place between parties here and their French
correspondents, and he particularly mentioned Reeve&rsquo;s with
Tocqueville&mdash;Lord Lansdowne having probably shown Palmerston
the letter which Tocqueville wrote to
Reeve<a name="FNA_10_01" id="FNA_10_01"></a><a href="#FN_10_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD PALMERSTON AND THE TORIES.</span>
before the great debate in the Chamber. Clarendon said
he could not imagine what Palmerston had to complain of in
the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; as, though there had been some articles attacking
him, the far greater number had been in his favour.
Melbourne said there had been a great deal the other way,
and that Palmerston and his Tory friends with whom he
had communicated had been constantly surprised to find
that there was an influence stronger than their own in that
quarter.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_10_01" id="FN_10_01"></a><a href="#FNA_10_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
[This was a very remarkable letter M. de Tocqueville wrote to me in
November, showing the danger of driving France to extremities, which
might involve the overthrow of the Government in that country. Tocqueville
was always penetrated with the conviction that the throne of Louis
Philippe rested on no solid foundation; and undoubtedly the Treaty of July
1840 was a severe blow to its stability, and led to further disputes, and
more fatal consequences. The letter in question was shown by me to Lord
Lansdowne, and I was told it was read to the Cabinet. At any rate, it was
read by Lord Melbourne, who attached great importance to it.&mdash;H.R.]</p></div>

<h3>January 9th, 1841</h3>

<p>The other day at Windsor, when Clarendon
was sitting talking with Melbourne, the latter in his lounging
way, as if thinking aloud, said, &lsquo;In all my experience, I
never remember such a state of things as the present; I
never remember, in the course of my political life, anything
at all like it; it can&rsquo;t last&mdash;it&rsquo;s impossible this Government
can go on; Palmerston in communication with the Tories&mdash;Palmerston
and Ashley&mdash;&rsquo; and then he stopped. Clarendon
said, &lsquo;What! you think Palmerston and the Tories will
come together?&rsquo; To which Melbourne nodded assent. &lsquo;And
which,&rsquo; Clarendon persevered, &lsquo;will come to the other: will
Palmerston go to Ashley, or will Ashley come to Palmerston?&rsquo;
To which Melbourne chuckled and grunted, laughed and
rubbed his hands, and only said, &lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; These
are the sentiments of the Prime Minister about his own
Government&mdash;a strange state of things: while Palmerston
is in confidential communication with the Tories, or some of
them, for the purpose of obtaining their support to his
policy, half of his own colleagues, though committed, being
adverse to it, and regarded by him as his worst adversaries.
He and John Russell, the two Secretaries of State&mdash;the
latter leader of the House of Commons&mdash;pass some days
together in the house of the former, without exchanging one
word upon the subject of foreign policy, and Lord John is
reduced to the necessity of gathering in conversation from
Neumann and Esterhazy what Palmerston&rsquo;s views and
opinions are. These two diplomats expressed the greatest
indignation at Ponsonby&rsquo;s proceedings, and Palmerston
himself has renewed to Bourqueney the assurances of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
resolution to adhere to the engagements he had already
made to France with regard to Egypt. Melbourne, however,
acknowledged that he was entirely in the dark as to Palmerston&rsquo;s
real views and opinions, as he believed was every
one of his colleagues. He has no intimacy, no interchange
of thought and complete openness with anybody, and all
they know is (and that only as soon as he thinks fit to
impart it) his notions with regard to each particular question
as its exigencies become pressing. His position, however,
is now a very remarkable one. Belonging to a Government
almost every member of which dislikes or distrusts him, he
has acquired, by recent events, a great reputation, and is
looked upon generally as a bold, able, and successful statesman.
In the event of a dislocation of parties, he is free to
adopt any course, and to join with any
party.<a name="FNA_10_02" id="FNA_10_02"></a><a href="#FN_10_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Almost all
the domestic questions which have hitherto excited interest
have been settled, compromised, or thrown aside, and a
sudden interest has been awakened, and attention generally
drawn to our foreign policy and international relations.
All that has recently occurred&mdash;our treaties and our warlike
operations&mdash;are not looked upon as the work of the Government,
but as that of Palmerston alone&mdash;Palmerston, in some
degree, as contradistinguished from the Government. All
this confers upon him a vast importance, and enables him,
neither unreasonably nor improbably, to aspire to head and
direct any Government that may hereafter be formed by a
dissolution and fresh combination of parties.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_10_02" id="FN_10_02"></a><a href="#FNA_10_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
[I believe at this time, Lord Palmerston, irritated by the opposition
and distrust of his own colleagues, and encouraged by the applause of the
Tories, who were delighted at the rupture of the alliance with France, and
eager to bully that country, did contemplate a junction with the Tory party.
But to this there was an insurmountable obstacle, the deep distrust and
dislike of Sir Robert Peel, who thought Palmerston a dangerous and mischievous
Foreign Minister, and the hostility of Lord Aberdeen. In fact,
when these statesmen came into office a few months later, they applied
themselves mainly to obliterate the traces of Palmerston&rsquo;s quarrels. Nothing
would have induced Sir Robert Peel to take Palmerston into his
Cabinet. It was otherwise, some years later, when Lord Stanley had succeeded
to the leadership of the Conservative Party, and at that time the
negotiations between him and Lord Palmerston were renewed, though without
any result.&mdash;H.R.]</p></div>

<span class="pagehead">THE DUCHESS OF CANNIZZARO.</span>
Notwithstanding the comparative tranquillity
which now prevails in France, the madness of that
people having taken another turn, and venting itself upon a
reckless expenditure, and the extravagant project of fortifying
Paris, Guizot is evidently aware of, and alarmed at,
certain intrigues now at work, for the purpose of his ejection.
Of these Molé is the object or the agent, or both.
Guizot sent over the other day to Reeve a paper, cleverly
done, in which Molé&rsquo;s position was discussed, and the morality
as well as possibility of his coming into office with the
aid of a coalition.</p>

<p>The other day died the Duchess of Cannizzaro, a woman
of rather amusing notoriety, whom the world laughed with
and laughed at, while she was alive, and will regret a little
because she contributed in some degree to their entertainment.
She was a Miss Johnstone, and got from her brother
a large fortune; she was very short and fat, with rather a
handsome face, totally uneducated, but full of humour, vivacity,
and natural drollery, at the same time passionate and
capricious. Her all-absorbing interest and taste was music,
to which all her faculties and time were devoted. She was
eternally surrounded with musical artists, was their great
patroness, and at her house the world was regaled with the
best music that art could supply. Soon after her brother&rsquo;s
death, she married the Count St. Antonio (who was afterwards
made Duke of Cannizzaro), a good-looking, intelligent,
but penniless Sicilian of high birth, who was pretty successful
in all ways in society here. He became disgusted with
her, however, and went off to Italy, on a separate allowance
which she made him. After a few years he returned to
England, and they lived together again; he not only became
more disgusted than before, but he had in the meantime
formed a <i>liaison</i> at Milan with a very distinguished
woman there, once a magnificent beauty, but now as old
and as large as his own wife, and to her he was very anxious
to return. This was Madame Visconti (mother of the notorious
Princess Belgioso), who, though no longer young, had
fine remains of good looks, and was eminently pleasing and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
attractive. Accordingly, St. Antonio took occasion to elope
(by himself) from some party of pleasure at which he was
present with his spouse, and when she found that he had
gone off without notice or warning, she first fell into violent
fits of grief, which were rather ludicrous than affecting, and
then set off in pursuit of her faithless lord. She got to
Dover, where the sight of the rolling billows terrified her so
much, that, after three days of doubt whether she should
cross the water or not, she resolved to return, and weep away
her vexation in London. Not long afterwards, however, she
plucked up courage, and taking advantage of a smooth sea
she ventured over the Straits, and set off for Milan, if not
to recover her fugitive better half, at all events to terrify
her rival and disturb their joys. The advent of the Cannizzaro
woman was to the Visconti like the irruption of the
Huns of old. She fled to a villa near Milan, which she
proceeded to garrison and fortify, but finding that the other
was not provided with any implements for a siege, and did
not stir from Milan, she ventured to return to the city, and
for some time these ancient heroines drove about the town
glaring defiance and hate at each other, which was the
whole amount of the hostilities that took place between
them. Finding her husband was irrecoverable, she at length
got tired of the hopeless pursuit, and resolved to return
home, and console herself with her music and whatever
other gratifications she could command. Not long after, she
fell in love with a fiddler at a second-rate theatre in Milan,
and carried him off to England, which he found, if not the
most agreeable, the most profitable business he could engage
in. The affair was singular and curious, as showing what
society may be induced to put up with. There was not the
slightest attempt to conceal this connexion; on the contrary
it was most ostentatiously exhibited to the world, but the
world agreed to treat it as a joke, and do nothing but laugh
at it. The only difference &lsquo;the Duchesse&rsquo; ever found was,
that her Sunday parties were less well attended; but this
was because the world (which often grows religious, but
never grows moral) had begun to take it into its head that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MACAULAY&rsquo;S CONVERSATION.</span>
it would keep holy the Sabbath <i>night</i>. The worst part of
the story was, that this profligate blackguard bullied and
plundered her without mercy or shame, and she had managed
very nearly to ruin herself before her death. What she had
left, she bequeathed to her husband, notwithstanding his
infidelities and his absence.</p>

<h3>January 21st, 1841</h3>

<p>I dined with Lady Holland yesterday.
Everything there is exactly the same as it used to be, excepting
only the person of Lord Holland, who seems to be
pretty well
forgotten.<a name="FNA_10_03" id="FNA_10_03"></a><a href="#FN_10_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The same talk went merrily round,
the laugh rang loudly and frequently, and, but for the black
and the mob-cap of the lady, one might have fancied he
had never lived or had died half a century ago. Such are,
however, affections and friendships, and such is the world.
Macaulay dined there, and I never was more struck than
upon this occasion by the inexhaustible variety and extent
of his information. He is not so <i>agreeable</i> as such powers
and resources ought to make any man, because the vessel
out of which it is all poured forth is so ungraceful and uncouth;
his voice unmusical and monotonous, his face not
merely inexpressive but positively heavy and dull, no fire in
his eye, no intelligence playing round his mouth, nothing
which bespeaks the genius and learning stored within and
which burst out with such extraordinary force. It is impossible
to mention any book in any language with which he is
not familiar; to touch upon any subject, whether relating
to persons or things, on which he does not know everything
that is to be known. And if he could tread less heavily on
the ground, if he could touch the subjects he handles with a
lighter hand, if he knew when to stop as well as he knows
what to say, his talk would be as attractive as it is wonderful.
What Henry Taylor said of him is epigrammatic and
true, &lsquo;that his memory has swamped his mind;&rsquo; and though
I do not think, as some people say, that his own opinions are
completely suppressed by the load of his learning so that
you know nothing of his mind, it appears to me true that
there is less of originality in him, less exhibition of his own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
character, than there probably would be if he was less
abundantly stored with the riches of the minds of others.
We had yesterday a party well composed for talk, for there
were listeners of intelligence and a good specimen of the
sort of society of this house&mdash;Macaulay, Melbourne, Morpeth,
Duncannon, Baron Rolfe, Allen and Lady Holland, and John
Russell came in the evening. I wish that a shorthand writer
could have been there to take down all the conversation, or
that I could have carried it away in my head; because it was
curious in itself, and curiously illustrative of the characters
of the performers. Before dinner some mention was made
of the portraits of the Speakers in the Speaker&rsquo;s House, and
I asked how far they went back. Macaulay said he was
not sure, but certainly as far as Sir Thomas More. &lsquo;Sir
Thomas More,&rsquo; said Lady Holland, &lsquo;I did not know he had
been Speaker.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; said Macaulay, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you remember
when Cardinal Wolsey came down to the House of Commons
and More was in the chair?&rsquo; and then he told the whole of
that well-known transaction, and all More had said. At
dinner, amongst a variety of persons and subjects, principally
ecclesiastical, which were discussed&mdash;for Melbourne
loves all sorts of theological talk&mdash;we got upon India and
Indian men of eminence, proceeding from Gleig&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life of
Warren Hastings,&rsquo; which Macaulay said was the worst book
that ever was written; and then the name of Sir Thomas
Munro came uppermost. Lady Holland did not know why
Sir Thomas Munro was so distinguished; when Macaulay explained
all that he had ever said, done, written, or thought,
and vindicated his claim to the title of a great man, till Lady
Holland got bored with Sir Thomas, told Macaulay she had
had enough of him, and would have no more. This would
have dashed and silenced an ordinary talker, but to Macaulay
it was no more than replacing a book on its shelf, and he
was as ready as ever to open on any other topic. It would
be impossible to follow and describe the various mazes of
conversation, all of which he threaded with an ease that
was always astonishing and instructive, and generally interesting
and amusing. When we went upstairs we got upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MACAULAY&rsquo;S MEMORY.</span>
the Fathers of the Church. Allen asked Macaulay if he had
read much of the Fathers. He said, not a great deal.
He had read Chrysostom when he was in India; that is, he
had turned over the leaves and for a few months had read
him for two or three hours every morning before breakfast;
and he had read some of Athanasius. &lsquo;I remember a
sermon,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;of Chrysostom&rsquo;s in praise of the Bishop of
Antioch;&rsquo; and then he proceeded to give us the substance
of this sermon till Lady Holland got tired of the Fathers,
again put her extinguisher on Chrysostom as she had done
on Munro, and with a sort of derision, and as if to have the
pleasure of puzzling Macaulay, she turned to him and said,
&lsquo;Pray, Macaulay, what was the origin of a <i>doll</i>? when were
dolls first mentioned in history?&rsquo; Macaulay was, however,
just as much up to the dolls as he was to the Fathers, and
instantly replied that the Roman children had their dolls,
which they offered up to Venus when they grew older; and
quoted Persius for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0">and I have not the least doubt, if he had been allowed to
proceed, he would have told us who was the Chenevix of
ancient Rome, and the name of the first baby that ever
handled a doll.</p>

<p>The conversation then ran upon Milman&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of
Christianity,&rsquo; which Melbourne praised, the religious opinions
of Locke, of Milman himself, the opinion of the world thereupon,
and so on to Strauss&rsquo;s book and his mythical system,
and what he meant by mythical. Macaulay began illustrating
and explaining the meaning of a <i>myth</i> by examples
from remote antiquity, when I observed that in order to
explain the meaning of &lsquo;mythical&rsquo; it was not necessary to
go so far back; that, for instance, we might take the case
of Wm. Huntington, S.S.: that the account of his life was
historical, but the story of his praying to God for a new pair
of leather breeches and finding them under a hedge was
mythical. Now, I had just a general superficial recollection
of this story in Huntington&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life,&rsquo; but my farthing rushlight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
was instantly extinguished by the blaze of Macaulay&rsquo;s
all-grasping and all-retaining memory, for he at once came
in with the whole minute account of this transaction: how
Huntington had prayed, what he had found, and where, and
all he had said to the tailor by whom this miraculous nether
garment was made.</p>

<h3>January 30th, 1841</h3>

<p>Parliament opened on Tuesday last with
a very meagre speech, on which no amendment could be
hung. The Duke spoke extremely well in the House of
Lords, and Peel the same in the House of Commons. Both
approved (the Duke without any qualification, Peel more
guardedly) of the foreign policy of the Government, and both
said everything that was conciliatory, nattering, and cordial
to France. John Russell and Palmerston both spoke in the
same tone, the latter especially, and his speech was totally
free from anything like triumph or exultation; in short,
nothing could be more favourable for Government than what
passed, and nothing more creditable to the country. It was
temperate and dignified, and exhibited a strong contrast to
the fury and bluster of the French debates and the Press,
and consequently displayed the superiority in every respect
of our national character over theirs. At present everything
promises a very easy session, and the Conservatives are confessedly
reduced to look to the chapter of accidents for some
event which may help them to turn out the Government and
get hold of their
places.<a name="FNA_10_04" id="FNA_10_04"></a><a href="#FN_10_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Lord John said something about
Lord Holland in the House of Commons, but Melbourne
could not be prevailed upon to say anything in the House of
Lords. Lady Holland was satisfied with Lord John&rsquo;s speech,
but though it was a prettily turned compliment, it was of no
great service in relieving him from the charges which have
been levelled at him in some of the
newspapers.<a name="FNA_10_05" id="FNA_10_05"></a><a href="#FN_10_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

[It is curious that a session which was destined to witness the important
proposals of the Whigs in the direction of free trade, and to end so
disastrously for the Liberal party, and so well for the Conservatives, should
have begun thus tamely.]</p></div>

[Lord Holland had been attacked for the part he took in opposition to
the Treaty of July in the preceding year, and for his earnest endeavours to
avert a rupture with France. The best answer to these aspersions on the
conduct of a most excellent man and true patriot occurs in a letter from M.
Guizot to Lady Holland of January 3, 1841, which has recently been published.
I transcribe the following sentences:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;J&rsquo;ai ressenti un vrai, un vif chagrin quand j&rsquo;ai vu le nom qui vous
est cher compromis d&rsquo;une façon si inconvenante dans nos débats.
J&rsquo;aurais voulu raconter moi-même, à tout le monde, sa bienveillance si
sincère pour la France, son désir si persévérant de maintenir entre nos deux
pays une amitié qu&rsquo;il regardait comme excellente pour tous les deux, et en
même temps sa constante préoccupation pour son propre pays, son dévouement
si tendre pour la Reine, son attachement si fidèle pour ses collègues.
Je n&rsquo;ai rencontré personne qui sût concilier à ce point tous les devoirs, tous
les sentiments, toutes les ideés. Dans la confiance de nos entretiens j&rsquo;ai bien
souvent regretté que tout le monde ne fût pas là pour l&rsquo;entendre, tout le
monde, Anglais, Français, ceux dont il ne partageait pas les opinions comme
ceux qui étaient de son avis. Il aurait exercé sur tout le monde une influence
bien salutaire, et les absurdes propos qui out été tenus, depuis qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;est
plus là, auraient été complètement impossibles.&rsquo;]</p></div>

Saturday.<a name="FNA_10_06" id="FNA_10_06"></a><a href="#FN_10_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
It must be owned they decide very
conscientiously. One man asked for exemption because he
had, by keeping away Conservative votes, decided an election
in favour of a Whig candidate, and, though otherwise disposed
to let him off, they made him Sheriff directly on
reading this excuse. I sat next to Palmerston. It was
amusing to see how everything is blown over, and how
success and the necessity of making common cause has reconciled
all jarring sentiments; and it was amusing to hear
Melbourne in one house and John Russell in the other
vigorously defending and praising Palmerston&rsquo;s policy. It
must be owned that Palmerston has conducted himself well
under the circumstances, without any air of triumph or
boasting either over his colleagues or his opponents or the
French. He has deserved his success by the moderation
with which he has taken it. I saw Bourqueney last night,
delighted with all that was said in Parliament, especially, of
course, by the Duke and Peel, but well satisfied with John
Russell and Palmerston, and he owned the tone of the latter
was unexceptionable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
Went the night before last to Exeter Hall,
to hear
Mr. Hullah<a name="FNA_10_07" id="FNA_10_07"></a><a href="#FN_10_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
give a lecture on the teaching of vocal
music in the Poor Law schools (and elsewhere). Very interesting,
well done, and the illustration of his plan by the
boys of Dr. Kay&rsquo;s school and other (adult) pupils of Hullah&rsquo;s
was excellent. The plan has been tried with great success
in France, Germany, and Switzerland, and the Education
Committee are disposed to assist in giving it a trial here.
These plans, which are founded in benevolence and a sincere
desire for the diffusion of good among the people, merit
every encouragement, and will in the end get it, for there
is, in the midst of much indifference and prejudice, a growing
disposition to ameliorate the condition of the masses,
both morally and physically.</p>

[I had myself put Mr. Hullah in relation with the Government, and
with Mr. Eden, who tried his system of musical instruction (based on Wilhem&rsquo;s
plan) at the schools at Battersea. Indeed, I persuaded Hullah to go
to France to study Wilhem&rsquo;s system, which was in operation there. Lord
Lansdowne saw that musical education was a neutral ground on which all
parties (those most divided) might agree; and he took up this idea with
success. Sydney Smith went to this lecture, to Hullah&rsquo;s great delight, and
it was very successful. Mr. Hullah, after a long and useful career, died in
1884.&mdash;H.R.]</p></div>

<p>Yesterday all the Tories were in high glee at their success
at the Canterbury and Walsall elections, the former not
having been expected by either party, and nevertheless they
had a majority of 165 votes. It is certainly curious, for the
Government have a right to be popular, or, at least, to
expect that no tide of unpopularity should rise against them;
and after all their successes, and the declared inability
of their opponents to find fault with them, it is strange that
they should lose ground to the extent that they have. The
Government see all the danger of their position, and how
very probable it is that they may be reduced to the necessity
of resignation or dissolution, and, though they have no hopes
of bettering themselves by the latter, they have made up
their minds to try the experiment, in order that they may
give the Queen no reason to accuse them of unnecessarily
deserting her, and not exhausting every expedient to retain

their places before they give them up. They are, however,
very much divided upon the question of what to dissolve upon,
some being for so doing on Stanley&rsquo;s Irish Registration Bill,
if then defeated, while others (more judiciously, <i>meâ sententiâ</i>)
are against going to the country on any Irish
question.<a name="FNA_10_08" id="FNA_10_08"></a><a href="#FN_10_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

[The Irish system for the registration of voters differed materially from
that of England. In Ireland, every person claiming to vote for the first
time was obliged to prove his title; in England, all claims were admitted
that were not objected to, and other abuses had crept in. Attempts had
been made by the Government to remedy this evil, but in vain; and in 1840
Lord Stanley, then in Opposition, took it in hand, and brought in an Irish
Registration Bill, which was opposed by O&rsquo;Connell and by Lord Morpeth,
then Irish Secretary, but on two successive divisions Ministers were beaten.
This Bill was, however, withdrawn. In 1841 Lord Stanley and Lord
Morpeth both brought in Irish Registration Bills; the former was meant to
clear the Register of fictitious voters, the latter was a Reform Bill in disguise,
for it extended the franchise to leaseholders rated at 5&#8467;. a year. The
contest between these two rival Bills occupied the early parts of the
session. The second reading of Lord Morpeth&rsquo;s Bill was carried by 299 to
294, but eventually the qualification clause was struck out of the Bill in
Committee by a division of 300 to 294 on April 29. (See Walpole&rsquo;s <i>History
of England</i>, vol. iii. p. 520.)]</p></div>

<h3>February 9th, 1841</h3>

<p>The Duke of Wellington had an attack
the other night in the House of Lords, and was taken home
speechless, but not senseless. It was severe, but short, and
after the stomach was relieved, he rapidly recovered, and in
a day or two <i>pronounced</i> himself as well as ever. Of course
the alarm was very great. He is very eager about politics,
and the Tory language is that of exceeding gloom about the
general aspect of affairs, while their own affairs, as far as
elections are concerned, flourish. In Monmouthshire the
Whig has resigned without a contest; the Tories affect to
consider Morpeth&rsquo;s Registration Bill as a revolution, while
the Whigs pretend that Stanley&rsquo;s will make every county in
Ireland a close Orange borough. Perhaps the debates may
strike out something approaching to the truth. Great disquietude
at the French armaments, considerable uneasiness
at the dispute with America, and much disgust at our having
been apparently bamboozled by the Chinese, form the principal
topics of political grievance and complaint.</p>

<h3>February 12th, 1841</h3>

<p>The other day I met Lord Howick, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
had a talk with him about the Irish questions now pending.
The Government are much pleased with his support of
Morpeth&rsquo;s Bill. As he stands, as it were, midway between
the two Bills, I asked him to explain to me the merits of the
question, which he did, as it seemed to me, fairly enough.
He approves of the machinery of Stanley&rsquo;s registration, and
of Morpeth&rsquo;s definition of the franchise, not binding himself
to <i>amount</i>, but not objecting to that proposed. He showed
me a letter he wrote to Stanley, in a very amicable strain,
setting forth the danger which he thought would attend any
settlement of the question which did not embrace a definition
of the franchise, and entreating him to reconsider the
question, for the purpose of coming to some arrangement.
The answer was not encouraging, for it consisted of a note
from Lady Stanley to Lady Howick, in which she said that
Stanley had got the gout in his hand, and could not write,
but desired her to say that he entirely disagreed with Howick.
Howick talked sensibly enough about it, and asked me if I
could not do anything to bring about a compromise, his
notion being that there should be a committee above stairs
to take evidence as to the effect of the 5&#8467;. franchise, and that
only the principle of definition should be admitted. I told
him I had no means whatever, had no access to any of the
leaders, that the only men to whom I could talk were
Graham or Fitzgerald, and that if I fell in with either,
I would see if any possibility presented itself.</p>

<h3>February 14th, 1841</h3>

<p>The day before yesterday I met Graham
by accident at Boodle&rsquo;s, so I took the opportunity of talking
to him about these Bills, and I soon found that there is no
possibility of any compromise. He expressed the greatest
alarm and disgust at Morpeth&rsquo;s measure; said that he had
never seen Stanley so determined, and that he and Peel both
entirely agreed with him; that he could not understand how
John Russell, or indeed any member of Lord Grey&rsquo;s Government,
could consent to such a violation of the principle of
the Reform Bill, and to the formation of a new franchise,
which, if granted, must entail similar concessions in England
and Scotland; that the intention of the framers of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SIR JAMES GRAHAM ON IRISH AFFAIRS.</span>
Reform Bill was that, in the counties, property and not
numbers should have influence, and the effect of this Bill
would be to transfer influence from property to numbers.
He spoke much of the unpopularity of the Government,
which he attributed to the Irish connexion, and thought
that this Bill would do them great harm in England. When
I urged the importance of settling affairs in Ireland, and
not leaving such a question as this to unite all the country
against them, if they came in again, and to revive the great
power of O&rsquo;Connell, which had for some time been waning,
and I pointed out the great danger that might arise from
Ireland in the present unsettled state of Europe, he said,
rather than consent to such a measure as this, he was prepared
to encounter every difficulty and danger; he would
never consent to transfer power from the landed interest to
the multitude; and as long as the priests interfered in Irish
elections, it could not be expected that landlords would not
counteract that influence by diminishing as much as they
could the numbers of those who were made to act under it;
that the old saying that Cromwell had confiscated too much,
or exterminated too little, was the truth; he saw no way of
pacifying that country, and as to concessions they must
have a limit, every concession had been made that could be
reasonably desired, and he would do no more. If they came
into power, he would be prepared to govern equitably, without
fear or favour, encouraging, without reference to political
or religious opinions, all those who supported the British
connexion, and with a determination to uphold without
flinching the national institutions. I asked him if he thought
no transaction could be effected with the Irish priests, so as
to reconcile them to Government; but he said that none
was, he thought, now feasible. He had been for the measure,
but now England would not grant an establishment to
the Catholic clergy, and if she would, they would not accept
it, for they never would abandon the advantages they enjoyed
under the present system of voluntary contributions,
which was in most cases more profitable than any provision
which could possibly be held out to them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
The result of all this presents very serious matter for reflexion,
for this Irish question will probably draw a broad
line of separation between parties, afford respective rallying-points,
and secure a formidable and united opposition if the
Tories come in; and one cannot regard without the greatest
apprehension the prospect of a systematic determined hostility
on the part of the Irish masses towards this country with
the certainty almost that the ground on which the battle will
be fought will be that of maintaining the Irish Church. This
is in point of fact the interest which the Tory or English
party regard. Ireland is denied her share in representation,
hers is made an exceptional case, because she is under
Catholic influence, and because that Catholic influence will,
they suspect, if ever it is strong enough, exert its strength
in overturning the English Church. I do not think anybody
of sense and information believes that the Irish Catholic
clergy or laity have any disinclination to British connexion,
except so far as they are in their own eyes degraded or
injured by it. There exists, and there ever will exist, that
one deep feeling, constantly kept burning in the minds of
the laity by the undying zeal of the clergy, that Catholic
Ireland is insulted and impoverished by the vast Protestant
ecclesiastical establishment, that in the most important, the
most heart-stirring of all interests, an interest at once temporal
and spiritual, they are stripped of those equal and
essential rights which are possessed by England and Scotland.
I have never doubted that sooner or later this contest
would arise, and that the end of it will be, however long in
coming, the downfall of the Church of England in Ireland,
as fall it
ought.<a name="FNA_10_09" id="FNA_10_09"></a><a href="#FN_10_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The debate lasted four nights on Morpeth&rsquo;s
Bill, and Ministers got a majority of five, both sides
bringing down the sick and the dying without remorse. A
close division and parties nicely balanced, extinguish all feelings
of humanity. The best speeches were Charles Buller&rsquo;s,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SETTLEMENT OF THE EASTERN QUESTION.</span>
Sheil&rsquo;s, Follett&rsquo;s, Peel&rsquo;s, and John Russell&rsquo;s. It is supposed
this will bolster them up for the Session, but something still
depends on Stanley&rsquo;s Bill.</p>

<p>Foreign affairs have assumed a better aspect. A negotiation
is going on <i>here</i> for the purpose of inviting France to
join the alliance, and take part in the final settlement of the
Eastern Question, which she desires no better than to accept,
and then to disarm; indeed, she has already begun to do so.
The delay is occasioned by some difficulty as to the forms
to be adopted. The French want some phrases, which don&rsquo;t
seem unreasonable in themselves, but about which the Russian
makes a difficulty. There is to be a Note, and in this Note
Bourqueney wishes it to be expressly stated that the integrity
of the Ottoman Empire is now secured, but Brunnow makes
this strange objection, that they should thereby be admitting
the <i>de jure</i> occupation of Algiers by the French. This seems
such a frivolous objection that it is difficult to conceive it
can be the real one. The wonder is that Palmerston, who
carries everything with so high a hand, does not overrule it
<i>auctoritate suâ</i>. He has been showing off his flippancy lately
not only to France, but to Austria, writing despatches to
Lord Granville, which are in such a tone that he complains
bitterly of being instructed to read them to Guizot; and,
with regard to Austria, this occurred: Metternich wrote
some letter complaining of delay in settling the question
of Mehemet Ali&rsquo;s hereditary possession of Egypt, which, it
seems, nettled Palmerston, and he wrote a remarkably clever
but very insolent answer, in which he reviewed the vacillations
and inconsistencies of the Austrian Cabinet in a very
offensive style. This despatch was read by the Cabinet;
and I fancy generally disapproved, very much so by Melbourne,
who however did not interfere, and let it go. But
Frederick Lamb, who has all the confidence and courage
which Melbourne wants, very quietly put it in his drawer,
and wrote word to Palmerston that circumstances were
changed and he should not give it to Metternich. Melbourne
was very much pleased at this, and said it was very judicious;
but he forgot that it was his business to stop it in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
the first instance, and that, thinking it imprudent, as Prime
Minister he ought to have put his veto on it. But he is only
Prime Minister in name, and has no authority. He is all
in all at Buckingham Palace, but very little in Downing
Street.</p>

<h3>March 2nd, 1841, Tuesday</h3>

<p>On Sunday I met Bourqueney at
dinner. He was very gloomy, talked of the debate in the
Chamber and the declarations in favour of keeping up the
<i>isolement</i> as &lsquo;<i>très-grave</i>,&rsquo; and then complained bitterly, but
obscurely, of the difficulties he encountered here, and how
hard it was, after the unanimous expressions in both Houses
of Parliament, that such obstacles should be cast in the way
of a settlement, hinting at Palmerston as the cause, but
without being explicit; indeed, it was in the carriage going
to Lady Holland&rsquo;s, and there was not time for more. To-day,
however, I have heard more; and it seems that Palmerston
has been at his tricks again, though I don&rsquo;t yet know precisely
what he has done. My brother keeps writing me
word that his tone in his communications to the French
Government, through Lord Granville, is very offensive; but
here he appeared to be really anxious to conciliate. It is,
however, quite impossible to make out what he is at. He
has contributed more than anybody to give this Government
a <i>federal</i> character; for in the Foreign Office he has resolved
to be, and he is, wholly independent of his colleagues. He
tells them as much or as little of his proceedings as it suits
his purpose or his fancy to do; and they are now so well
aware of this, and have so little confidence in him, that when
he does tell the Cabinet anything they feel no security that
they are acquainted with the truth or, at least, the whole
truth. In the pending matter, Esterhazy and Bülow have
been vehemently urging the completion of an arrangement,
but the Cabinet settled that no overture should be made to
France without previously ascertaining that she would accept
it when made. All very proper! It was settled that the
other Powers should beg Palmerston to invite France in all
their names to join in a Convention for securing the free
navigation of the Bosphorus; and this Convention was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE PROTOCOL DELAYED.</span>
arranged at a Conference some day last week, and at the
same time a Protocol&mdash;which was to <i>precede</i> it&mdash;stating that,
the objects of the July alliance being completed, the alliance
was at an end. All this was agreed to, and on Saturday at
the Cabinet the Convention was read and approved of; but
objections were made to the Protocol on the ground that
questions might still arise requiring the intervention of the
alliance, that no certain intelligence had yet arrived either
of the evacuation of Syria by Ibrahim or the publication of
the firman by the Sultan, and, therefore, it would be imprudent
to break up the alliance just at this moment, and this
operation might as well be deferred for a brief space. Such
was the general sentiment. Melbourne said, &lsquo;Are you sure
France will take the Convention?&rsquo; to which Palmerston
replied, he had no doubt she would, as it had been put into
his hands by Esterhazy, who had probably already communicated
it to Bourqueney. But he did not tell the Cabinet
that he had agreed at the Conference to the Protocol likewise,
and had left his foreign colleagues under the impression
that it would be agreed to by the Cabinet.</p>

<p>On Sunday night Bülow and Bourqueney met Normanby
at Lady Holland&rsquo;s, when they both spoke to him in the
strongest terms, more especially Bülow; who said it was
very painful to him to complain to Normanby of the conduct
of Palmerston, and he would not repeat what had passed at
the Conference, but he must tell him if Palmerston continued
to conduct himself as he did, the most fatal consequences
would ensue, and the affairs of Europe would become
more embroiled and be in a more perilous state than they
had ever been yet. He frightened Normanby so much that
the next morning he went off to Melbourne, told him what
had passed, and entreated him to interfere. Melbourne promised
he would, but of course he will not; and Palmerston
will probably not care a straw what he says, or be in the
slightest degree biassed by any opinion he may express. As
far as I can guess, Bourqueney&rsquo;s excessive discontent arises
from this: He very naturally wants this Protocol, and
Bülow and Esterhazy, no doubt, told him that Palmerston
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
had consented to it and would propose it to him; whereas,
in their conference on Sunday, Palmerston probably offered
him the Convention but did not say a word about the Protocol,
and this both he and Bülow consider a great breach of
faith. Notwithstanding the good reason which there really
is for not formally dissolving the alliance till all the arrangements
concerning Egypt and Syria are completed, it is easy
to understand that in the present temper of France it would
be impossible for Guizot to enter into any relations with the
other Powers till their separate and exclusive alliance is at
an end. It is no wonder, therefore, that Bourqueney looks
upon the Protocol as an essential condition of his acceptance
of the Convention; and if he has been first given to understand
that the Protocol was admitted, and then told by
Palmerston that it could not be, he might naturally be indignant.
One never knows what else Palmerston may have
said nor what tone he may have taken.</p>

<p>While these difficulties are obstructing a pacific arrangement
here, they are rendered much more serious by the
discussions in the French Chamber on the Secret Service
money, when the insolent and extravagant speeches in favour
of keeping up the <i>isolement</i> and the state of armed observation
were hailed with vociferous applause; and this frantic
violence is the Parliamentary response to the calm and
dignified expression of peace and goodwill to France which
marked our first Parliamentary night, and in which the
leaders of all parties joined with equal cordiality. If this
goes on, and if Guizot is not strong enough to give effect to
his pacific disposition and to venture upon a reconciliation,
all amicable feelings towards France will be swallowed up in
a general sentiment of indignation at her insolence; and instead
of wasting any more time in fruitless endeavours to
bring her back into the councils of Europe, we shall begin
to think of the means of securing ourselves against any
possible effects of her ill-will and obstinate resentment.
Those who have most strongly advocated the French alliance
will be soon ready to cement that of the four great Powers,
to curb the extravagant pretensions and mischievous designs

of France, if the latter does not come to her senses and
descend from her high horse very soon.</p>

<h3>March 4th, 1841</h3>

<p>Yesterday morning Dedel, who was pretty
accurately acquainted with all that has lately passed, called
on me. His account confirmed my notions. The other
Ministers of the Conference had told Bourqueney what he
was to expect at his conference with Palmerston. When,
therefore, the latter tendered him the draft of the Convention,
he said, &lsquo;This is very well, but have you nothing else
to give me?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Palmerston; &lsquo;what do you mean?
I know of nothing else.&rsquo; &lsquo;Have you not also a Protocol,
announcing the <i>clôture</i> to propose to me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh no; that is
impossible. There has been a question of such a Protocol,
but great difficulties have arisen. Chekib says he cannot
agree to such a Protocol without previous application to his
Court and receiving a specific authority.&rsquo; On this, Bourqueney
very indignantly said, &lsquo;he must know it was quite useless to
offer him the one without the other, as the formal termination
of the alliance of July was an indispensable preliminary
of any convention to which France could be a party.&rsquo; A
warm conversation followed, in the course of which (as Dedel
says), Bourqueney saying, &lsquo;Nous ne sommes pas pressés,&rsquo;
Palmerston replied in his most insolent tone, &lsquo;Et nous ne
sommes pas pressés non plus; si vous ne craignez pas les
bâtiments anglais, vous sentez bien que nous ne craignons
pas les bâtiments
français....&rsquo;<a name="FNA_10_10" id="FNA_10_10"></a><a href="#FN_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_10_10" id="FN_10_10"></a><a href="#FNA_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
[This was untrue, as appears by the next entry.]</p></div>

<h3>March 5th, 1841</h3>

<p>At the Cabinet dinner the day before yesterday,
Palmerston announced that &lsquo;everything was going on
well, everybody satisfied,&rsquo; and as this rose-coloured aspect of
affairs was so inconsistent with the gloom and discontent of
Bourqueney and Bülow, and the account given me by Dedel,
I resolved to call on Bourqueney, and find out from him in
what position the affair stood. I did so, and the result
proved with what caution one ought to listen to the reports
of persons the best informed, and who relate what they have
heard with the most veracious intentions. Instead of correcting
or expunging what I have said above, I shall put
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
down the substance of what Bourqueney said to me, which
agrees with much of Dedel&rsquo;s account, but differs in some very
important particulars. I told him that I had (as he would
be sure) no desire to <i>fourrer</i> myself into his affairs, but that
I thought a little conversation between us might be useful
in promoting the object we had in common&mdash;that of restoring
amicable relations between the two countries; and having
seen how annoyed he was on Sunday last, and knowing what
had passed, I wished to know if he was not <i>now</i> better
satisfied than he was <i>then</i>; and that as I, and those with
whom I communicated, only knew what passed between him
and Palmerston, or at the conferences, from Palmerston&rsquo;s
own reports, when he told his colleagues just what he
pleased and no more, and as I had heard from other
quarters an account of his interview on Sunday with Palmerston,
I wished to know what had really passed. He had,
he said, been extremely annoyed and disappointed, after
being told that he was to have the Protocol (by Bülow and
Esterhazy, of course), when Palmerston told him this was
out of the question, as Chekib refused to sign it without
orders. He then gave me the conversation between himself
and Palmerston, which does not appear to have been
acrimonious, and instead of Palmerston&rsquo;s having made that
insolent speech which was put in his mouth when Bourqueney
said, &lsquo;Mais nous ne sommes pas pressés,&rsquo; he only
said, &lsquo;Ni nous non plus, c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;Autriche et la Prusse qui
sont pressées;&rsquo; so that all the offensive part was a fabricated
addition, and I have no doubt of this by Bourqueney&rsquo;s way
of speaking of it. He said, moreover, &lsquo;Il faut rendre justice
à Lord Palmerston, son ton a été excellent, et jamais il n&rsquo;a
prononcé le mot de désarmement;&rsquo; that if he had, or had
attempted to impose any condition, he should at once have
rejected all overtures; but nothing of the kind had been
attempted, and he admitted that every respect had been
shown to France, and a sincere desire evinced to renew
relations with her. He said, &lsquo;Enfin vous êtes triomphants,
et nous sommes humiliés,&rsquo; and you can well afford to treat
us &lsquo;avec des égards;&rsquo; but he seemed to think that in point
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PROTOCOL AND CONVENTION SIGNED.</span>
of fact the Conference was already practically dissolved, for
both Bülow and Esterhazy had declared (in their anxiety for
the <i>clôture</i>, as an indispensable preliminary to the Convention,
for which their eagerness is intense), that, happen what
might, they would take no farther part in Eastern affairs.
On the whole, the prospect is good, and it is but just to
Palmerston to say that he does not seem to have acted unfairly
or insolently, or to be obnoxious to any reproach in
his relations with Bourqueney.</p>

<h3>March 12th, 1841</h3>

<p>The Protocols were duly signed and the
Convention sent to Paris. They were well received by
Guizot, who returned them for some verbal alterations which
have been agreed to, and if no new difficulties arise in the
East to prevent a settlement, our relations with France will
be restored. But within these few days a whole budget of
bad news has poured in&mdash;from China, where the admiral has
resigned on the plea of ill-health, having done nothing but
lose half the troops he took out, and leaving affairs in a very
uncertain and unsatisfactory state. I had a letter from
Emily Eden<a name="FNA_10_11" id="FNA_10_11"></a><a href="#FN_10_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
yesterday, in great disgust at the waste of time,
money, and life, and the failure hitherto of all the objects
we had in view. The Chinese have bamboozled and baffled
us, that is the plain truth.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_10_11" id="FN_10_11"></a><a href="#FNA_10_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>
[Miss Emily Eden had accompanied her brother, Lord Auckland, to
India, where he was Governor-General. This impression of the state of our
relations with China appears to have been erroneous. On February 1st,
Captain Elliot annexed the island of Hong Kong, which has been permanently
united to the British Empire, and on April 18th Her Majesty&rsquo;s forces
occupied Canton.]</p></div>

<p>Then the violence and bad spirit displayed in America
have produced no small consternation here, though everybody
goes on saying that a war between the two countries,
and for so little cause, is
impossible.<a name="FNA_10_12" id="FNA_10_12"></a><a href="#FN_10_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
It does seem impossible,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
and the manifest interest of both nations is opposed
to it; but when a country is so mob-governed as America,
and the Executive is so destitute of power, there must be
great danger. However, the general conviction is, that the
present exhibition of violence is attributable to the malignity
of the outgoing party, which is desirous of embarrassing
their successors, and casting on them the perils of a war or
the odium of a reconciliation with this country, and strong
hopes are entertained that the new Government will be too
wise to fall into the snare that is laid for them, and strong
enough to check and master the bad spirit which is rife in
the Northern States. The real difficulty arises from the
conviction here, that in the case of M&rsquo;Leod we are in the
right, and the equally strong conviction there, that we are
not, and the actual doubt on which side the truth lies.
Senior, whom I met the other day, expressed great uncertainty,
and he proposes, and has written to Government on
the subject, that the question of International Law shall be
submitted to the decision of a German University&mdash;that of
Berlin, he thinks, would be the best. This idea he submitted
to Stevenson, who approved of it, but the great difficulty
would be to agree upon a statement of facts. Yesterday
Lord Lyndhurst was at the Council Office, talking over the
matter with Sir Herbert Jenner and Justice Littledale, and
he said it was very questionable if the Americans had not
right on their side; and that he thought, in a similar
case here, we should be obliged to try the man, and if convicted,
nothing but a pardon could save him. These opinions
casting such serious doubts on the question of right, are at
least enough to restrain indignation and beget caution.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_10_12" id="FN_10_12"></a><a href="#FNA_10_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a>
[This refers to the case of one M&rsquo;Leod, who had been engaged as a
member of the Colonial forces in repelling the attack made upon Canada
from United States territory, and who had consequently acted as an agent
of the British Government. But M&rsquo;Leod was arrested at New York in
1841 upon a charge of the murder of one Durfee, who was killed during the
capture of the &lsquo;Caroline.&rsquo; The American authorities refused to give him
up on the demand of the British Minister, who alleged that M&rsquo;Leod&rsquo;s deed
was a legitimate act, done in obedience to his superior officers. He was
tried, and fortunately acquitted; but Mr. Webster, the American Secretary
of State, subsequently admitted that individuals concerned in a public
transaction under the orders of their Government could not be held responsible
to the ordinary tribunals of law for their participation in it. See
Halleck&rsquo;s <i>International Law</i>, vol. i., p. 430; and Hale&rsquo;s
<i>International Law</i>, p. 261.]</p></div>

<p>Besides China and America, two days ago appeared the
Sultan&rsquo;s firman restoring the Pasha, but on terms which he
was certain not to accept. This document, which arrives
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BAD EFFECT OF THE HATTI-SHERIF.</span>
just as we are renewing our relations with France, and
which carries on the face of it the strongest marks of Lord
Ponsonby&rsquo;s interference and influence, is well calculated to
obstruct the arrangement, and so it appeared to Clarendon,
to Lord Lansdowne, to Melbourne, and to John Russell.
Clarendon immediately appealed to Lord John, who, however,
took it very quietly, and was averse to saying or doing
anything; and when he spoke to Melbourne, the latter said
Palmerston had shown him Ponsonby&rsquo;s private letter, in
which he said that he had nothing to do with it, that it was
all Stürmer&rsquo;s<a name="FNA_10_13" id="FNA_10_13"></a><a href="#FN_10_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
doing, and that for some time past he had
not been able to make Redschid Pasha mind a word he said.
On the other hand, Lord John also spoke to Palmerston,
when Palmerston said not a word of Ponsonby&rsquo;s letter, but
told him it was the best possible arrangement; that Mehemet
Ali had not understood it at first, but that he would in the
end be quite satisfied with it, and that it was the only way
of preventing confusion. Of course Melbourne and Lord
John were quite content, and fully partake of Palmerston&rsquo;s
entire satisfaction. Yesterday morning, however, I found
that Francis Egerton was full of indignation at this fresh
outrage, as he considered it, of Ponsonby&rsquo;s, and had taken
a resolution to bring the matter forward in the House of
Commons, but previously to speak to the Duke and Peel.
Nothing was done last night, and this morning he came and
told me that they both agreed with him, but that the Duke
urged the necessity of extreme caution, and of previously
ascertaining the sentiments of the other Allies, as we must
not do or say anything which might disturb our harmony
with them. This caution, and not any indisposition to
take the matter up, was the reason no notice was taken
in the House of Commons last night, and they are now
waiting for further information to determine what course to
take.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_10_13" id="FN_10_13"></a><a href="#FNA_10_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a>
[M. Stürmer was the Austrian Internuncio at Constantinople.]</p></div>

<h3>March 14th, 1841</h3>

<p>On Friday, Francis Egerton put questions
to Palmerston, and Peel took a part. He told me that he
was much surprised at the way in which Palmerston received
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
as well as answered them, as they had intended nothing
hostile and thought it was doing him a service, and affording
him an opportunity of explaining away the bad effect
of the Hatti-sherif, but that he took it very ill, and answered
with evident embarrassment. From his manner,
and the way in which Labouchere cheered when Palmerston
said that their intention had been to give a <i>bonâ fide hérédité</i>
to Mehemet Ali, he inferred there was some disagreement in
the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Yesterday Reeve went off to Paris, having had a conference
with Lord Lansdowne, who not only expressed his
dissatisfaction with the firman, but authorised him to say
so to M. Guizot, and to assure him that this was the sentiment
of the Government, and that it was quite inconsistent
with any instructions to Ponsonby <i>which he had ever seen or
heard of</i>.</p>

<p>The Tories were extremely dissatisfied with Palmerston&rsquo;s
answers the other night, but they have an extraordinary
reluctance to provoke any discussion on foreign affairs,
though he is so vulnerable on all points. It is, however,
highly probable that the matter will not be suffered to rest
here. In such a manner does one bold, unscrupulous, and
able man predominate over his colleagues, one of whom is
John Russell, not less bold at times, and as able as himself;
but of a quiet disposition, shrinking from contest, controversy,
and above all, I take it, from the labyrinth of underhand
dealing which he must thread and disentangle, if he
insists upon a regular settlement of accounts with Palmerston.
There is no other way of accounting for his acquiescence
in the latter&rsquo;s proceedings. As for the rest, Melbourne
is too indolent, Lansdowne too timid, and the others too
indifferent to interfere. Clarendon has the will and the
courage, but he can do nothing alone, and he cannot rouse
anybody else to take part with him. If Lord Holland were
still alive, something might now be done.</p>

<p>The other night Peel, who has been a good deal nettled
by the attacks on him in a series of letters, signed &lsquo;Catholicus,&rsquo;
in the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; made a very striking speech upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">FRESH OBSTACLES.</span>
education and recreation of the people, which was enthusiastically
cheered by the Whigs, but received in silence by
the Tories. He made a sort of reply in this speech to the
charges of irreligion insinuated in these letters, and took
the opportunity of expressing those liberal sentiments which
mark his own identification with the progress of society, and
which render him, from their liberality and wisdom, the
object of such suspicion, fear, and dislike with the Tory
democracy who reluctantly own him for their leader.</p>

<h3>March 16th, 1841</h3>

<p>On Friday last, after the House of Lords
was over, the Ministerial Lords gathered on the bench and
had a sort of Cabinet, a practice in which Melbourne takes
pleasure. Clarendon held forth about the state of the
Eastern Question, and said all he thought without reserve.
He worked up Lansdowne to a considerable amount of zeal
and resolution to bestir himself. The next day Lansdowne
called on Melbourne, and he owned to Clarendon that he
was shocked and surprised to find that Melbourne had never
had any communication with Palmerston on the subject,
and, in point of fact, knew very little about what was going
on. The next day there was a Cabinet, when both Lansdowne
and Clarendon expressed their opinion with vivacity,
complaining of the proceeding at Constantinople, and urging
the necessity of some decisive step being taken here to correct
its effects. Palmerston knocked under; that is, he
made no defence and no resistance, and ostensibly acquiesced
in the opinions expressed, and promised to act in conformity
with them. Though no reliance can be placed on him, and
none is placed, it would appear as if he was become aware of
the necessity of making his actions correspond with his professions
and with the opinions which have been so strongly
expressed in all quarters; for I met Bourqueney last night,
who told me that he really did think they were at last making
progress towards a satisfactory conclusion, that he had received
his instructions (which I already knew were to say
the French Government would hear of nothing till this Hatti-sherif
was disavowed) and had instantly got the Conference
convened, and that a formal notification had been made by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
the Four Powers to the Turkish Ministers of their disapprobation
of the firman, and this seems to have been done
in a way he considers satisfactory.</p>

<h3>March 19th, 1841</h3>

<p>The Bishop of Exeter got a heavy fall in
the House of Lords the other night on the St. Sulpice
question.<a name="FNA_10_14" id="FNA_10_14"></a><a href="#FN_10_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
He brought it forward in an elaborate speech the
week before, with his usual ability and cunning; and he
took the Duke of Wellington in; for, after hearing the
Bishop protest, and apparently make out, that &lsquo;a great blow
had been struck at the Reformation,&rsquo; he got up, and, in
total ignorance of the subject, committed his potential voice
and opinion to an agreement with the Bishop&rsquo;s dictum.
The truth, however, was that there was no case at all; the
Government had not only done what they were justified in
doing, but they had acted in precise conformity with the
conduct held by all their Tory predecessors, colonial secretaries,
and with that of the Duke of Wellington himself,
who had forgotten all that had occurred and the part he had
previously taken. The consequence was that the Tories resolved
to throw the Bishop over, and so they did, greatly to
his rage and disgust and to the satisfaction of all the bigots;
not even a solitary Bishop or high Tory had a word to say
in his favour. He was detected in the course of the debate
of having sent a report to the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; of his former speech
containing a very essential paragraph which he had omitted
in the speech itself. He tried to back out of it, and brought
the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; reporter as his witness; but he stood convicted
in general opinion.</p>

<p>Reeve is gone to Paris. He saw Guizot on his arrival,
who announced to him what he meant to do. He waits till
the Four Powers have settled the Eastern Question, in which
he will not meddle in the slightest degree; and when it is
settled, he will be ready to join in the Convention. Bourqueney
has signed the document <i>de bene esse</i>; this is his
wisest and most dignified course.</p>

<h3>March 30th, 1841</h3>

<p>Nothing new for the last fortnight, the
Eastern Question apparently progressing to a settlement
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DEBATE ON THE POOR LAW.</span>
through some not very important obstacles, and, what is of
much greater consequence, a fair prospect of an amicable
arrangement with America. The new President&rsquo;s inaugural
speech, pedantic and ridiculous as it was, had the merit
of being temperate; and Webster had already written to
Evelyn Denison, desiring him not to judge of the real sentiments
of America by the trash spoken and the violence
exhibited in Congress, or by the mob of New York. John
Bull, too, who had begun to put himself into a superfine
passion, and to bluster a good deal in the French vein, is
getting more tranquil, and begins to see the propriety of
going to work moderately and without insisting on having
everything his own way.</p>

<p>In Parliament there has been nothing of interest but the
Poor Law Bill, debated with great heat, and the several
clauses carried by majorities very little indicative of the real
opinion of the majority of the House. But the truth is that the
Tories are (generally) behaving very ill on this question, and
their shabbiness is the more striking because the Government
have behaved so well. The Tories are just as anxious
for the passing of the Bill as their opponents, or more so,
nevertheless they stay away or abuse and oppose the clauses,
in order to curry favour with their own constituencies and to
cast odium on their opponents, by which they may profit in
the event of a general election. There is probably not a
man of them who would not be annoyed and disappointed to
the greatest degree if the Bill should be impaired in its
leading principles and material provisions. The Government
might, if they had chosen it, have proposed the law as an
experimental measure for a short period, so as to cast upon
their opponents the ultimate responsibility of the measure,
but they dealt with it liberally and wisely, and without
reference to temporary interests or party purposes, which, so
far from eliciting a corresponding spirit from their opponents,
only afforded them the opportunity (of which, without
shame or decency, they are availing themselves) to convert it
into a source of unpopularity against the Government who
bring it forward.</p>

While the American question looks well, the
affairs of the East are all unsettled again. The Pasha has,
with all humility, declined the conditions of the Sultan&rsquo;s
Hatti-sherif, and the whole thing remains still to be adjusted.
Nobody, however, cares or thinks much about it at
all, for the Eastern business is become as tedious as a twice-told
tale. No more danger to the peace of Europe is apprehended
from it; nobody cares a straw for Sultan or Pasha,
and still less for the repose of the countries they misgovern
or the happiness of the people they oppress.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Peel has dined at the Palace for the first time
since the Bedchamber quarrel, and this is deemed important.
All domestic interest is absorbed in the blow which
has fallen upon Lord Granville at Paris, in the shape of a
paralytic stroke, which, from the character of the man, his
social position, and the important and unhappy consequences
of this affliction to a numerous class of people, excites a very
deep and general interest.</p>

<h3>May 2nd, 1841</h3>

<p>The approach of the Newmarket meetings
usually absorbs my thoughts, oppresses me with its complicated
interests, and destroys all my journalising energies.
After a month&rsquo;s interval, I take up my pen to note down
the events that have occurred in it. I went to Newmarket on
Saturday before the Craven Meeting, and on Sunday morning
received a letter informing me of the sudden death of my sister-in-law
(Mrs. Algernon Greville), which obliged me to return
to town. This grievous affliction, so heavy and irreparable
to those whom it immediately concerns, matters but little
to the mass of society, who for the most part good-naturedly
sympathised with the sufferers; but the object, so precious to
the narrow circle of her own family, was too unimportant to
the world at large to be entitled to anything more than a
passing expression of regret. I went down to the funeral,
and was unutterably disgusted with the ceremony, with the
bustling business of the undertaker, mixing so irreverently
with the profound grief of the brothers and other relations
who attended, the decking us out in the paraphernalia of
woe, and thus dragging us in mourning coaches through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LOSS OF THE &lsquo;PRESIDENT.&rsquo;</span>
crowds of curious people, by a circuitous route, that as much
of us as possible might be exhibited to vulgar curiosity.
These are things monstrous in themselves, but to which all-reconciling
custom makes us submit.</p>

<p>This is not the only misfortune which has fallen upon
individual heads; but of all occurrences that which has excited
the greatest interest has been the loss, as it must now
be concluded, of the &lsquo;President&rsquo; steamer, with, among others,
the Duke of Richmond&rsquo;s young son on board. Day after
day people have watched and enquired with the most intense
interest for the arrival or for news of this vessel, and are only
now slowly and reluctantly abandoning all hope, while the
wretched parents have been for weeks past agitated with
all the alternations of hope and despair, and suffering a
protracted torture worse than any certainty. So much for
private woes.</p>

<p>In the world of politics we have had an interval of repose
till after the recess, when Government sustained two defeats
on the Irish Registration
Bill,<a name="FNA_10_15" id="FNA_10_15"></a><a href="#FN_10_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and Walter came in for
Nottingham on an Anti-Poor-Law cry, and by the union of
Chartists and Tories to defeat the Whig candidate. After
the first division, Clarendon wrote to me as follows: &lsquo;The
defeat last night was a signal one. We have had a Cabinet
about it, and I went there fully expecting that resignation
would be the order of the day&mdash;<i>the word never crossed the lips
of anyone!</i> Various expedients were suggested, but, except
by me, the thought of going out was not entertained. The
result is, that another trial of strength is to be had, and if
we are beaten the Bill is to be withdrawn for the year. How
Stanley&rsquo;s is afterwards to be opposed remains to be seen,
but for that we trust to luck and O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s ingenuity in
devising delays&mdash;not very creditable or satisfactory, but as
John has to defend his course, he is the best judge of
what he should do. He quite scouted to me afterwards the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
idea of resigning, though he admitted the Tory chances had

that of determination, and of a man ready to take the
government.&rsquo; Nobody has a guess what will happen&mdash;whether
Government will try and go on, dissolve or resign;
and a thousand speculations, and, of course, lies, are
afloat.

<p>The affairs of the East are still unsettled, but there
seems a chance of their being patched up, though not in
a way very creditable or consistent. Metternich is now
threatening the Porte, that unless she consents to what the
Conference shall suggest he will quit the concern. Palmerston,
meanwhile, talks of again licking Mehemet Ali,
while Ponsonby is as furious as ever at Constantinople, and
would blow up the coals again if he knew how. The manner
in which things are mystified, and facts perverted from the
truth, is curiously exemplified in the matter of the recent
Hatti-sherif. It was affirmed, when the severity of its
terms was objected to and Ponsonby blamed, that Ponsonby
had had no hand in it whatever. This was true, but how?
He insisted upon a <i>much more severe</i> clause being inserted,
on the Pasha&rsquo;s being made a mere stipendiary of the Porte,
and his revenue being levied by Turkish officers; and because
the Turkish Minister would not go this length, Ponsonby
flew into a rage, and refused to sanction the Hatti-sherif
with his approval unless this clause was added, so that he
had nothing to do with it, only because it was not so
stringent and violent as he wished to make it.</p>

<p>Great agitation yesterday at the clubs, and
excessive interest and curiosity about coming events, on
which hang the existence of the Government. The Tories
are talking of a vote of want of confidence, and wish to
follow up their successes by this decisive blow. There is
the greatest difference of opinion among the Whigs as to
the necessity of resigning, and, above all, as to a dissolution.
The event of the day was the resignation of Gordon, Secretary
of the Treasury, who could not stand the Corn alteration
that is threatened. Nobody thinks Ministers will

<h2 style="font-variant: small-caps">The Royal Precedency Question.</h2>


<p style="font-size: 85%">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
[As Mr. Greville&rsquo;s pamphlet on the Precedency Question is now
rarely to be met with, it may be convenient to reprint it in this
place. It is a tract of considerable originality and research, and
it was carefully revised and approved by Lord Wensleydale and
some of the most eminent lawyers of the time when it was written.
This essay has therefore a substantial legal and historical value.
Moreover, its application is not exclusively retrospective or confined
to the peculiar case of the precedency of the late Prince Consort at
the time of his marriage, which gave rise to warm debates, for it
deals with the precedency of the members of the Royal Family, not
being sons or daughters of a sovereign, or standing in close propinquity
to the throne. In the course of years these personages
have become numerous, and for the first time in our history (at least,
since the reign of James I.), between twenty and thirty grandchildren
and great-grandchildren of the reigning sovereign are in
existence, whose claims to precedency will have to be considered.
By the 31st Henry VIII., which assigns places in Parliament and
Council to the sons, brothers, uncles, and nephews of the king, after
these degrees are past, peers or others of the blood royal are entitled
to no place or precedence, except what belongs to them by their
personal rank or dignity. The mere fact of their descent, in a more
remote degree, from the sovereign, gives them in law no precedency
at all, although it may be conceded to them by custom, and the
respect willingly paid to members of the Royal Family. Nor are they
entitled to bear the title of &lsquo;Royal Highness&rsquo; unless it be conferred
upon them by the Crown. Thus, if I am not mistaken, the late
Duke of Gloucester, who was a nephew of George III., was not a
&lsquo;Royal Highness&rsquo; until he married the Princess Mary, the king&rsquo;s
daughter, when that distinction was conferred upon him. In two
or three generations from the present time it is not improbable that
the descendants of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert will exceed a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
hundred persons, and, although they will doubtless all look back
with pride to their illustrious ancestry, they will have no rank or
precedency, in the strict sense of the term, except such as may be
conferred upon them personally by the Crown. For these reasons, it
appears to me that Mr. Greville&rsquo;s remarks on the subject may have
some future interest.&mdash;H.R.]</p>

<hr />

<p style="margin-top: 0em">In the House of Lords on Tuesday, 4th February, when Prince Albert&rsquo;s
Naturalisation Bill was under discussion, Lord Brougham said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That these questions of precedence were of a very difficult and doubtful
nature. It was therefore a great convenience to submit them to the House,
because it enabled Parliament to make that quite certain, which, if dealt
with under the common law of the country, might be open to objection.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The interest which has been excited by this question, and the doubts
which prevail, even among the learned in the law, as to the actual extent
of the Royal prerogative in the matter of granting precedence, are sufficient
to provoke an enquiry into the opinions of writers upon constitutional law,
an examination of the ancient practice, and of some of the cases which seem
to bear immediately upon the point, in order, if possible, to arrive at something
like a reasonable conclusion as to the power actually possessed by the crown,
and the manner in which, and extent to which, it might be just and
expedient to exercise it upon the present occasion.</p>

<p>The first question which presents itself is, What have been the ancient
prerogatives of the Crown in granting dignities or pre-eminencies of any
description; and, secondly, In what respect, if at all, these prerogatives have
been limited or restrained by any Parliamentary enactment. By the laws of
England, the Sovereign is considered the fountain of honour and of privilege,
and the constitution has entrusted to him the sole power of conferring
dignities and honours, in confidence that he will bestow them on none but
such as deserve
them.<a name="FNA_11_01" id="FNA_11_01"></a><a href="#FN_11_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The King may create new titles, and has the prerogative of conferring privileges
upon private
persons,<a name="FNA_11_02" id="FNA_11_02"></a><a href="#FN_11_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>

<p>The King could create a peer, and give him precedence over all other
peers of the same
rank,<a name="FNA_11_04" id="FNA_11_04"></a><a href="#FN_11_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
a prerogative which was not unfrequently exercised
in ancient times. Henry VI. created Henry Beauchamp Earl of Warwick
and Præcomes totius Angliæ, and afterwards Duke of Warwick, with a
right to sit in Parliament after the Duke of Norfolk, but <i>before</i> the Duke of
Buckingham; the same King created Edmund of Hadham Earl of Richmond,
and gave him precedence over all other earls, and Jasper of Hatfield Earl
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
of Pembroke with precedence next to the said Earl of
Richmond.<a name="FNA_11_05" id="FNA_11_05"></a><a href="#FN_11_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
There
appears to have been no limit to the authority of the Crown in granting
honours, titles, dignities, and offices, excepting only that it could not grant
new offices with fees annexed, because that would be a tax upon the subject,
which can only be imposed by Act of Parliament. Assuming, then, that
such was the extent of the prerogative previously to the 31st of Henry VIII.,
the next question is, Whether it was restrained by that statute; and if it
was, within what limits it was thenceforward confined? The preamble
asserts the prerogative of the Crown in the strongest terms; probably for
the express purpose of guarding against any inference that it was thereby
abridged or restrained. It is difficult to believe that, in passing the Act
entitled &lsquo;for placing the Lords,&rsquo; Henry VIII. felt any doubt as to the possession,
or scruple as to the exercise, of the prerogative of his progenitors, and
still less that he had the remotest idea of divesting himself of an iota of his
own. The despotic temper of the King, the subservient character of his
Parliaments, and his habitual employment of them as the most obsequious
instrument of his will, make it probable that he adopted this, merely as the
easiest and most convenient mode of settling a difficult and complex question,
but without the slightest misgiving as to his own power, or any notion of
restraining himself from granting any privilege or precedence it might at
any subsequent period be his pleasure to bestow. The circumstances under
which the provisions of this Act were carried into operation were remarkable,
and give it much more the appearance of a decree of the King, or a resolution
of the Lords, than of an Act of the Three Estates. The assent of the
Commons seems to have been assumed as a matter of course, and as soon as
it had passed the Lords (which it did very hastily), it was immediately put
in force, &lsquo;Concerning the passing it, it is observable, that on Monday,
1st May, the Lord Chancellor quandam introduxit billam concernentem
assignationem locorum, &amp;c., which was that day read twice; the next day
it had a third reading, and on Friday a fourth; on the morrow, the Lord
Cromwell is placed before the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the others are
placed according to the Act, being before placed without regard to their
offices, but it was not returned from the House of Commons with their
assent till the Monday
following.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_11_06" id="FNA_11_06"></a><a href="#FN_11_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The preamble of the Act is in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;For in as much as in all great councils, or congregations of men, having
sundry degrees and offices in the commonwealth, it is very requisite and
convenient that an order should be had and taken for the sitting of such
persons, that they knowing their places may use the same without displeasure,
or let of the council, therefore the King&rsquo;s Most Royal Majesty, <i>tho&rsquo;
it appertaineth unto his prerogative Royal, to give such honour, reputation,
and placing to his counsellors, and other his subjects as shall be seeming to his
most excellent wisdom</i>, is, nevertheless, pleased and contented for an order to
be had and taken in this his Most High Court of Parliament, that it shall be
enacted by the authority of the same, in manner and form as hereafter
followeth:&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
Then come nine sections settling the places in which the Royal Family,
great officers of state, and others, are to sit in the Parliament Chamber, and
the tenth section enacts that, &lsquo;as well in all Parliaments as in the Star
Chamber, <i>and in all other assemblies and conferences of council</i>, the Chancellor,
Lord President, Privy Seal (that is the Chancellor, President, and Privy
Seal, above all dukes, not being the king&rsquo;s sons, &amp;c., and the Great Chamberlain,
Marshal, Lord Steward, Chamberlain, and Chief Secretary, being a
Baron above all others of the same degree), shall sit and be placed in such
order and fashion as is above rehearsed, and not in other place by authority
of this present Act.&rsquo;</p>

<p>There exists what may be deemed very fair evidence to show that in
those days the Royal prerogative <i>as to precedence</i> was never supposed to be
abridged by this Act, but on the contrary that it still continued to flourish
in undiminished force. Only two months afterwards Henry was divorced
from Anne of Cleves, when, as is well known, he bribed her into compliance
with his wishes by a liberal grant of money and of honours. By his letters
patent he declared her his adopted sister, and gave her <i>precedence</i> before all
the ladies in England, next his queen and daughters, and therefore before
his
nieces<a name="FNA_11_07" id="FNA_11_07"></a><a href="#FN_11_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and their children, who were directly in the succession to the
crown.<a name="FNA_11_08" id="FNA_11_08"></a><a href="#FN_11_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
On the 3rd November, 1547, Edward VI. granted to his uncle,
the Duke of Somerset, immediately after his victory in Scotland, letters
patent of precedence, in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;As our most dear uncle Edward, Duke of Somerset, by the advice of
the Lords, we have named ... to be governor of our person and protector
of our realm ... during our minority, hath no such place appropriated and
appointed to him in our High Court of Parliament, as is convenient and
necessary, as well as in proximity of blood unto us, being our uncle ... as
well as for the better maintaining and conducting of our affairs. We have,
therefore, as well by the consent of our said uncle, as by the advice of other
the Lords and the rest of the Privy Council, willed, ordained, and appointed,
that our said uncle shall sit alone, and be placed at all times ... in our
said Court of Parliament, upon the bench or stole standing next our seat
royal, in our Parliament Chamber.... And further, that he do enjoy all
such other privileges, pre-eminences, &amp;c. &amp;c. <i>The statute concerning the
placing of the Lords in the Parliament Chamber and other assemblies of
council, made in the thirty-first year of our most dear father, of famous

<p>This instrument must, under the circumstances, be taken as the act of
Somerset himself; and it is inconceivable that he should have had the
audacity to attempt in his own behalf, that for which the plenitude of
Henry VIII.&rsquo;s power had been deemed insufficient, or to have perpetrated in
the name of a minor king, a direct and useless violation of a recent statute&mdash;more
especially when the same object might have been as easily accomplished
by the authority of Parliament, where the Protector&rsquo;s popularity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
would have ensured a ready compliance with his wishes. This view of the
case receives confirmation from the total absence of any allusion to this
grant in the charges which were soon afterwards urged against him&mdash;everything
that malice could devise was raked together for the purpose of swelling
the articles of impeachment; but neither when he was degraded from the
Protectorate, nor afterwards when he was deprived of life, was any accusation
brought against him, tending to show that these letters patent were
considered illegal or unconstitutional. Nearly a century later, Lord Coke
lays it down that no Act of Parliament can bind the king from any prerogative
which is inseparable from his person, &lsquo;but that&rsquo; (Mr. Hallam adds)
&lsquo;was before he had learned the bolder tone of his declining
years.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_11_10" id="FNA_11_10"></a><a href="#FN_11_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The order of Baronets was a new creation by James I., but his decision
of the controversy which arose touching a point of precedency thereupon,
shows the prevailing notions of the royal prerogative. </p>

<p>&lsquo;The King&rsquo;s most excellent Majesty, having taken into his royal
audience and censure a certain controversy, touching place and precedence,
between the younger sons of viscounts and barons, and the baronets, being
a degree by His Majesty recently created, which controversy did arise out of
some dark words contained in the letters patent of the said baronets. His
Majesty well weighing that the letters patent of the Baronets have no
special clause or express words to give them the said precedence, and being
a witness unto himself, which is a testimony above all exception, that his
princely meaning was only to give and advance the new dignity of His
Majesty&rsquo;s creation, but never therewithal tacitly and obscurely to injure a
third party.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_11_11" id="FNA_11_11"></a><a href="#FN_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
... And then he goes on to give precedency to Knights of
the Garter, Privy Councillors, Judges, &amp;c.; over the younger sons of
Viscounts and Barons, &lsquo;in all places, and upon all occasions, any constitution,
order, degree, office, service, place, employment, custom, use, or other
thing to the contrary notwithstanding.&rsquo; From Henry VIII. to James I.
were the high and palmy days of prerogative, when the authority of the
Crown was something even more transcendental than that of Parliament
itself, and when it was no doubt held that, while the Crown could dispense
with the provisions of an Act of Parliament, an Act of Parliament could
never bind the prerogative of the Crown; but when Lord Coke began to
adopt his &lsquo;bolder tone&rsquo; he laid down very different law, and he says
expressly, in speaking of the Act of Henry VIII., &lsquo;But Henry, though
standing as much upon his prerogative, as any of his progenitors, finding how
vexatious it was to himself, and distasteful to his ancient nobility, to
have new raised degrees, raised to precedency of them, and finding that this
kind of controversy for precedency was of that nature, that it had many
partakers, spent long time, and hindered the arduous, urgent, and weighty
affairs of the Parliament, was content to bind and limit his prerogative by
Act of Parliament, concerning the precedency of his great officers, and his
nobility.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_11_12" id="FNA_11_12"></a><a href="#FN_11_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Whatever may have been the constitutional notions of the sixteenth or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
the seventeenth century, there can be no doubt that the lawyers of the
nineteenth would hold, according to Lord Coke&rsquo;s latter dictum, that the
prerogative of the Crown is limited and restrained by the 31st Henry VIII.,
and it is only worth while to ascertain what it previously was, in so far as
such an enquiry can assist in the solution of the present question; for the
same lawyers would probably be unanimous in declaring that, except so
far as it was expressly limited and restrained by that statute, the prerogative
still remains undiminished and in all its pristine vigour&mdash;that Queen
Victoria possesses all the power which Henry VIII. enjoyed, saving that of
which he was specifically divested by this Act.</p>

<p>The Act &lsquo;for placing the Lords&rsquo; restrains the Queen from granting any
precedence in Parliament <i>or in the Council</i>, over any of the Royal and
official personages and others, who have places assigned to them therein.
She may make any man a Privy Councillor, but she cannot authorise him to
sit in a higher place than that to which he is by law entitled, or above those
whose places are marked out by the statute. If Prince Albert, for example,
was to be made a Privy Councillor, not being a peer, he would, <i>of absolute
right</i>, be entitled to no place but that of a junior Privy Councillor, or to such
as a Knight of the Garter might claim; and all the persons specified in the
Act would have <i>an absolute right</i> to take precedence of him <i>in Council</i>.
And it is worth while to consider in what a curious predicament he might
have been placed, if the Bill for his naturalisation had passed with those
amendments as to his precedence which are said to have been contemplated
by the Opposition Lords&mdash;that is, supposing always the rule of precedence
established by law to be carried inflexibly into operation.</p>

<p>If the status of Prince Albert had been fixed immediately after all the
members of the Royal Family, and immediately before the Archbishop of
Canterbury, and if Her Majesty should be hereafter pleased to make both
Prince George of Cambridge and Prince Albert members of her Most
Honourable Privy Council, in what order of precedence would these princes
be obliged to take their respective seats at the board? In order clearly to
comprehend this point, it is necessary to explain the ancient usage as to
Royal precedence, and the manner in which it has been affected by the 31st
Henry VIII. The Royal Family are to be considered in two lights, according
to the different senses in which the term <i>Royal Family</i> is used&mdash;the
larger sense includes all who may <i>possibly</i> inherit the Crown; the confined
sense, those within a certain degree of propinquity <i>to the reigning Prince</i>,
and to whom the law pays an extraordinary respect; but, after that degree
is past, they fall into the rank of ordinary subjects. The younger sons of
the king, and other branches of the Royal Family, not in the immediate line
of succession, were only so far regarded by the ancient law as to give them
a certain degree of precedence over peers and other officers, ecclesiastical
and temporal. This was done by the 31st of Henry VIII., which assigns
places in the Parliament Chamber and Council to the king&rsquo;s sons, brothers,
uncles, and nephews, &amp;c.&mdash;&lsquo;therefore, after these degrees are past, peers, or
others of the blood royal, are entitled to no place or precedence, except what
belongs to them by their personal rank or dignity, which made Sir Edward
Walker complain that, by the creation of Prince Rupert to be Duke of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
Cumberland, and of the Earl of Lennox to be duke of that name, previous
to the creation of James to be Duke of York, it might happen that their
grandsons would have precedence of the grandsons of the Duke of
York.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_11_13" id="FNA_11_13"></a><a href="#FN_11_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

Blackstone, vol. i. p. 226.</p></div>

<p>Prince George of Cambridge, then, being neither son, brother, uncle, or
nephew to the Queen, and having no personal dignity, is not entitled to any
precedence over the Archbishop of Canterbury, or the great officers of state;
the 31st Henry VIII. would place him below them all; but the 3rd Victoria
(supposing such an Act to have passed) would have placed Prince Albert
below Prince George, but above the Archbishop, who is himself above
Prince George, thus giving to the Master of the Ceremonies the solution of
a somewhat difficult problem of precedence&mdash;namely, how to place A above
B, B above C, and C above A. This <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> at least proves
that the amended Act would not only not have settled the question of
precedence satisfactorily, but would not have settled it at all.</p>

<p>It may seem surprising or paradoxical to assert, and many may with
difficulty believe, that Prince George of Cambridge is entitled to no precedence
of his own, inseparable from his royal birth, but such, nevertheless, is
undoubtedly the fact. By law, he can only take <i>royal</i> rank as the son,
brother, uncle, or nephew, of the reigning sovereign, none of which he is,
and he derives none whatever from having been nephew of William IV. and
George IV., and grandson of George III. The princes of the Blood Royal
have, as to precedence, a moveable and not a fixed status, constantly shifting,
with their greater or less propinquity to the actual sovereign; and in the
event of Prince George&rsquo;s succession to his father&rsquo;s dukedom, he would only
be entitled to a place <i>in Parliament and in the Council</i>, according to the
ancienty of his peerage.</p>

<p>The practice, however, does not wait upon the right, and is regulated by
the universal sense and feeling of the respect and deference which is due to
the Blood Royal of England. The Archbishop of Canterbury does not take
a legal opinion or pore over the 31st of Henry VIII. to discover whether he
has a right to jostle for that precedence with the cousin, which he knows
he is bound to concede to the uncle, of the Queen; but he yields it as
a matter of course, and so uniform and unquestionable is the custom, that
in all probability neither the Prince nor the Prelate are conscious that it is
in the slightest degree at variance with the right.</p>

<p>The obscurity which involves the question of precedence, and the prevailing
doubts as to the extent of the Royal prerogative, proceed, in a great
measure, from the intermixture of law and custom, by which the practice is
regulated and enforced. The table of precedence, the authority of which
is recognised for all social and ceremonial purposes, rests upon statutory
enactments, ancient usages, and the king&rsquo;s letters patent; usage creeping in
to disarrange the order, and break the links of the chain forged by the law;
for, while the 31st of Henry VIII. places earls after marquises, custom interposes
and postpones the former to the eldest sons of dukes (and so of
Marquis&rsquo;s eldest sons and viscounts), though these are only commoners
in the eye of the law. Now, as no custom (unless expressly saved) can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
prevail against the force of a statute, this renders it still more clear, that
nothing was intended by the 31st Henry VIII. but &lsquo;the placing the Lords&rsquo;
in Parliament,<a name="FNA_11_14" id="FNA_11_14"></a><a href="#FN_11_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
and that the question of general precedence (with all the
prerogatives of the Crown thereunto appertaining) was left untouched by
it.<a name="FNA_11_15" id="FNA_11_15"></a><a href="#FN_11_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
In point of fact, the royal prerogative always has been, and still
continually is exercised, in violation of the order of the established table;
for when the King, by his Royal warrant, gives to one of his subjects, having
neither rank nor dignity, the place and precedence of a duke&rsquo;s or an earl&rsquo;s
son, the individual thus elevated supersedes all those (below that rank)
whose place and precedence is determined either by law or custom.</p>

Lord Herbert, in his Life of Henry VIII, says, in allusion to this statute, &lsquo;it was
declared also how the Lords in Parliament should be placed,&rsquo; p. 218.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_11_15" id="FN_11_15"></a><a href="#FNA_11_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a>
Lord Coke clearly distinguishes between precedence in Parliament and Council
and general precedence:&mdash;Thus far for avoiding contention about precedency in Parliament,
Star Chamber, and all other assemblies, Council, &amp;c. Now, they that desire to
know the places and precedency of the nobility and subjects of the realm, as well men
as women, and of their children (which we have added the rather, for that the contention
about precedency between persons of that sex is even fiery, furious, and sometimes
fatal), we will refer you to a record of great authority in the reign of Henry VII.,
entitled.&rsquo;&mdash;4th Inst. 363.</p></div>

<p>The result, then, appears to be that, in the olden time, the king had
unlimited power in matters of honour and precedence, and could confer
whatever dignity or pre-eminence he thought fit, upon any of his subjects.
That this power has been expressly restrained, quoad the Parliament
Chamber and the Council, but exists unfettered in all other respects.</p>

<p>In Parliament (should Prince Albert be created a peer), he would only
be entitled to a seat at the bottom of the degree to which he might belong,
and he would be expressly prohibited from sitting nearer to the throne. In
the Privy Council likewise (if made a Privy Councillor) he would be
entitled to no especial place, but everywhere else, at ceremonials of every
description, at royal marriages, christenings or funerals, at banquets, processions,
and courtly receptions, at installations and investitures, at all religious,
civil, or military celebrations, upon all occasions, formal or social, public or
private, the Queen may grant to her husband an indisputable precedence and
pre-eminence over every other subject in the realm. It will probably
be less difficult to obtain a concurrence of opinion as to the extent of the
Queen&rsquo;s constitutional right in granting precedence, than as to the manner
in which it would be morally fit, and just to others, that this right should
be exercised.</p>

<p>The bill, as originally introduced in the House of Lords, was undoubtedly
liable to serious objections; but it is difficult to discover any valid reason
why the Prince, Consort to the Queen, should not be invested for his own
life with the highest personal dignity which it is in the power of the Crown
to confer.</p>

<p>It has been said, that to place Prince Albert before the princes of the
blood royal would be an invasion of the <i>birth right</i> of these illustrious
persons. This seems to be the result of a confused notion, that a privilege
of precedence is identical with a beneficial interest&mdash;it may be a man&rsquo;s birth
right to succeed in some contingency to the throne, or to a title or to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
an estate, and it would be injurious, and therefore unjust, to thrust any
interloper between him and his chance, however remote it might be, of such
succession. But the same Act which limits the prerogative of the Crown,
confers on the Royal Dukes and Great Officers of State the only right
of precedence which they possess, and while they can claim no more than
was given to them, the Crown is as surely entitled to all that was left to
it by that Act. No individual can insist upon an indefeasible right never to
be preceded, under any circumstances, by any other individual not having
a status defined by this Act, and as the uncles of the Queen, and the
hereditary Earl Marshal of England, occupy their respective steps in the
ladder of precedence, by the self-same title, there would be no greater
violation of birthright in placing an individual without a status before the
Duke of Sussex, than there would in placing him before the Duke of Norfolk;
if there be any injustice at all, the difference would not be in the principle,
but in its local or personal application.</p>

<p>The question, then, is one of expediency, and of propriety, to be determined
with reference to its own special circumstances, and according to the
analogies which can be brought to bear upon it; there is not only no case
exactly in point to refer to, but there is none sufficiently analogous to be
taken as a precedent. When Queen Anne came to the throne, Prince
George of Denmark was the only prince in England (all his children being
dead), and no new Act was necessary to give him precedence, if the Queen
had desired it, inasmuch as there was nobody for him to precede. The
condition of a Queen Consort is certainly very different from that of a
Prince Consort; but upon the broad principle of moral fitness, there seems
no reason why the husband of the Queen regnant should not be invested, by
virtue of his <i>consortium</i>, with the highest dignity, over other men, just as
the wife of the king is participant by virtue of her marriage of divers prerogatives
over other women. For the prerogatives with which the law
invests her are allotted to her not upon her own account, but upon that of
the king; she is considered as a <i>feme sole</i>, and has certain capacities and
rights, &lsquo;in order that the king whose continual care and study is for the
public, should not be troubled and disquieted on account of his wife&rsquo;s
domestic affairs.&rsquo; And the law, which out of respect to the king makes
it high treason to compass or imagine the death of his wife, when she becomes
a widow ceases to surround her with this protection. It is the king alone,
his dignity and his comfort, which the law regards, and the privileges and
pre-eminences of his family are conferred or established in such modes and
proportions as may be most conducive thereto.</p>

<p>The principle on which precedence is established is that of propinquity
to the sovereign, and no propinquity can be so close as that of the husband
to the wife, nor does it seem unreasonable that all other subjects should be
required to yield the outward forms of honour and respect to the man who
is elevated to a station so far above them, whom she is herself bound to
&lsquo;love, honour, serve, and obey,&rsquo; and who is superior to her in their natural,
while still subordinate in their civil and political relations. Many people
who are not unwilling to concede a high degree of precedence to the Prince,
are very sensitive about the dignity of the heir apparent, and while they are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
content that he should precede his other children, would on no account
allow him to be superior in rank to a Prince of Wales. The difficulty in
these cases is to establish a principle; but that difficulty is rendered much
greater if, when the principle is once admitted, it is not taken with all its
legitimate and necessary consequences. If the Prince is entitled to claim
precedency over any of the blood-royal of England, above all others, he may
claim it upon every moral ground over his own children, nor is there any
civil or political consideration in reference to the heir apparent, requiring
that an exception should be made in his behalf. There seem to exist
confused notions of something very extraordinary and transcendant in the
status of a Prince of Wales, but the difference between him and his younger
brother is not very great; and the only positive privilege with which the
law certainly and exclusively invests the heir apparent, is that of making it
high treason to attempt his
life.<a name="FNA_11_16" id="FNA_11_16"></a><a href="#FN_11_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_11_16" id="FN_11_16"></a><a href="#FNA_11_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a>
It is also treason to kill certain judicial officers when in actual execution of their
offices.&mdash;Hale, P. C. 13.</p></div>

<p>The heir apparent is Prince of Wales, and Duke of Cornwall, but he is
not necessarily either the one or the other, and except on a certain condition
he cannot be the
latter.<a name="FNA_11_17" id="FNA_11_17"></a><a href="#FN_11_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
For as the king <i>creates</i> his elder son, or heir
apparent, Prince of Wales, he has the power of withholding such creation,
and though the eldest son of the king is Duke of Cornwall by inheritance,
the dukedom is limited to the first begotten son of the
king.<a name="FNA_11_18" id="FNA_11_18"></a><a href="#FN_11_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_11_17" id="FN_11_17"></a><a href="#FNA_11_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a>
Two months elapsed between the death of Frederick Prince of Wales, and the
creation of his son, George III., Prince of Wales.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_11_18" id="FN_11_18"></a><a href="#FNA_11_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a>
If, for example, George IV. had died in his youth, his next brother might have
been heir apparent, with no other title than that of Bishop of Osnaburgh. Henry VIII.
after the death of Prince Arthur, and Charles I. after that of Prince Henry, were
Dukes of Cornwall, but by special new creation.&mdash;H., P.C. 13.</p></div>

<p>The Prince of Wales has no right or privilege beyond those of any other
subject; he owes the same faith and allegiance to the sovereign; and since
1789 none have ever ventured to assert that he could claim the regency
rather than any other subject. His political condition, therefore, is little if
at all different from that of the rest of the Royal Family. His personal
propinquity to the sovereign must be less than that of his father, and the
question is, whether there is anything so peculiar in his status as to supersede
those natural relations of father and son, which, according to all human
custom, as well as divine injunction, involve the duty of honour from the
latter to the former.</p>

<p>The son&rsquo;s enfranchisement from parental rule when he arrives at years
of discretion does not exempt him from the honour he is bound by the law
of God and nature to pay to his parents.<a name="FNA_11_19" id="FNA_11_19"></a><a href="#FN_11_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
The son is under a perpetual
obligation to honour his father by all outward expressions, and from this
obligation no state can absolve him. &lsquo;The honour due to parents&rsquo; (says
Locke) &lsquo;a monarch on his throne owes his mother, and yet this lessens not
his authority, nor subjects him to her
government.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_11_20" id="FNA_11_20"></a><a href="#FN_11_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
The monarchical
theory ascribes to the King of England two bodies or capacities, a natural
body, and a politic or mystical body, and &lsquo;from this mystical union of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
ideal with the real king, the enquirer after constitutional information is led
through childish reasoning and unintelligible jargon, to practical consequences
founded on expediency.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_11_21" id="FNA_11_21"></a><a href="#FN_11_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
These practical consequences are the
complete subordination of the natural to the politic capacity of the sovereign,
and that moral revolution which supersedes the duty of the son to the
father by the superior duty of the subject to the sovereign. Nothing less
transcendental seems sufficient to cancel the force of this natural obligation,
and while father and son are both in the condition of subjects, the filial and
parental relations need not be outwardly reversed.</p>

<p>If the Queen, therefore, should be advised to grant to her Royal Consort
letters patent of precedence immediately next to her own person, and at the
same time make him a Privy Councillor, there would be no practical difficulty
with regard to his place at the Council Board, notwithstanding the
legal exception; there custom has in a great measure superseded law. The
occasions are very rare when any of the Royal Dukes are present; and upon
all others, the Prince would sit upon the right hand of Her Majesty, and
precedence would be conceded to him as a matter of course. The Council
Board is no longer what it was in the days of Henry VIII., at which time
the King sat there regularly in person. The greater part of the Privy
Councillors were in constant attendance upon
him.<a name="FNA_11_22" id="FNA_11_22"></a><a href="#FN_11_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
They resided in the
Court, and accompanied him wherever he went; much (though far from all)
of the most important business of the State was transacted there, and the
order of sitting, when the members had to deliver their opinions seriatim,
beginning with the lowest, was not unimportant. Councils are now merely
formal assemblies, for the expedition of certain orders, which must emanate
from the sovereign in person.</p>

Sir H. Nicholas&rsquo; Preface to Council Register, vol. i. p. 13.</p></div>

<p>When any of the Royal Dukes are present, they sit next the Queen on
her right hand, the Lord President always next her on her left. And,
although the Lord President and the Chancellor (when present) sit on
either side of the Queen, all the other officers are indiscriminately placed.
It would not probably be deemed advisable to go back to the end of the
seventeenth century for a precedent, or it would be found that Prince
George of Denmark sat in council, without taking any oaths; not, therefore,
as a Privy Councillor, but <i>pro honoris causâ</i>. He always, however,
occupied the place of honour, and his attendance was very regular, though
there is no record of his having ever taken the oaths; and, at the accession
of King William, when all the other Privy Councillors were sworn, it is
expressly stated that Prince George was
not.<a name="FNA_11_23" id="FNA_11_23"></a><a href="#FN_11_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_11_23" id="FN_11_23"></a><a href="#FNA_11_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a>
He was first brought into Council by James II. in person, and placed on his
right hand, but not sworn.</p></div>

<p>It is much to be regretted that such heat and irritation have been
manifested in the discussion of this question, and certainly between the
proceedings in both Houses of Parliament. Prince Albert may well have
thought his reception neither cordial nor flattering; but the truth is, that
any mortification which either the Prince or the Queen may have felt (and
in her it is only natural, whether just or not) is at least as attributable to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
the really objectionable nature of the propositions which were made, as to
the opposition which they encountered.</p>

<p>Nothing herein is more to be deplored than that any mistaken zeal
should misrepresent the conduct, or any hasty impression misconstrue the
motives, of the Duke of Wellington. His whole life has been a continual
manifestation of loyalty and of superiority to petty purposes, and unworthy
inducements; but his notions of loyalty are of a nature which mere courtiers
are unable to comprehend, because he always considers the honour and the
interests of the Crown, in preference to the personal inclination of the
sovereign.</p>

<p>Of all men who ever lived he has sought the least the popularity he has
so largely acquired&mdash;the tide of which, sometimes diverted by transient
causes, has always returned with accumulated force. With him it is no
&rsquo;echo of folly, and shadow of renown,&rsquo; but a deep, affecting, almost sublime
national feeling, which exults in him as the living representative of national
glory. If there be an exception in any place to this universal sentiment,
let us hope that the impression will not endure, that the cloud of momentary
error will be dispersed, and that justice, ample and not tardy, will be
rendered to</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project

copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
