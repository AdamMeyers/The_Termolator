    <h1>
      MISS PHILLY FIRKIN, <br /><br /> The China-Woman.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      By Mary Russell Mitford
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In Belford Regis, as in many of those provincial capitals of the south of
      England, whose growth and importance have kept pace with the increased
      affluence and population of the neighbourhood, the principal shops will be
      found clustered in the close, inconvenient streets of the antique portion
      of the good town; whilst the more showy and commodious modern buildings
      are quite unable to compete in point of custom with the old crowded
      localities, which seem even to derive an advantage from the appearance of
      business and bustle occasioned by the sharp turnings, the steep
      declivities, the narrow causeways, the jutting-out windows, and the
      various obstructions incident to the picturesque but irregular
      street-architecture of our ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, Oriel Street, in Belford,&mdash;a narrow lane, cribbed and
      confined on the one side by an old monastic establishment, now turned into
      alms-houses, called the Oriel, which divided the street from that branch
      of the river called the Holy Brook, and on the other bounded by the
      market-place, whilst one end abutted on the yard of a great inn, and
      turned so sharply up a steep acclivity that accidents happened there every
      day, and the other <i>terminus</i> wound with an equally awkward curvature
      round the churchyard of St Stephen's,&mdash;this most strait and
      incommodious avenue of shops was the wealthiest quarter of the Borough. It
      was a provincial combination of Regent Street and Cheapside. The houses
      let for double their value; and, as a necessary consequence, goods sold
      there at pretty nearly the same rate; horse-people and foot-people jostled
      upon the pavement; coaches and phaetons ran against each other in the
      road. Nobody dreamt of visiting Belford without wanting something or other
      in Oriel Street; and although noise, and crowd, and bustle, be very far
      from usual attributes of the good town, yet in driving through this
      favoured region on a fine day, between the hours of three and five, we
      stood a fair chance of encountering as many difficulties and obstructions
      from carriages, and as much din and disorder on the causeway as we shall
      often have the pleasure of meeting with out of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most popular and frequented shops in the street, and out of all
      manner of comparison the prettiest to look at, was the well-furnished
      glass and china warehouse of Philadelphia Firkin, spinster. Few things are
      indeed more agreeable to the eye than the mixture of glittering cut glass,
      with rich and delicate china, so beautiful in shape, colour, and material,
      which adorn a nicely-assorted showroom of that description. The
      manufactures of Sèvres, of Dresden, of Derby, and of Worcester, are really
      works of art, and very beautiful ones too; and even the less choice
      specimens have about them a clearness, a glossiness, and a nicety,
      exceedingly pleasant to look upon; so that a china-shop is in some sense a
      shop of temptation: and that it is also a shop of necessity, every
      housekeeper who knows to her cost the infinite number of plates, dishes,
      cups, and glasses, which contrive to get broken in the course of the year,
      (chiefly by that grand demolisher of crockery ware called Nobody,) will
      not fail to bear testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Philadelphia's was therefore a well accustomed shop, and she herself
      was in appearance most fit to be its inhabitant, being a trim, prim little
      woman, neither old nor young, whose dress hung about her in stiff regular
      folds, very like the drapery of a china shepherdess on a mantel-piece, and
      whose pink and white complexion, skin, eyebrows, eyes, and hair, all
      tinted as it seemed with one dash of ruddy colour, had the same
      professional hue. Change her spruce cap for a wide-brimmed hat, and the
      damask napkin which she flourished in wiping her wares, for a china crook,
      and the figure in question might have passed for a miniature of the
      mistress. In one respect they differed The china shepherdess was a silent
      personage. Miss Philadelphia was not; on the contrary, she was reckoned to
      make, after her own mincing fashion, as good a use of her tongue as any
      woman, gentle or simple, in the whole town of Belford.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was assisted in her avocations by a little shopwoman, not much taller
      than a china mandarin, remarkable for the height of her comb, and the
      length of her earrings, whom she addressed sometimes as Miss Wolfe,
      sometimes as Marianne, and sometimes as Polly, thus multiplying the young
      lady's individuality by three; and a little shopman in apron and sleeves,
      whom, with equal ingenuity, she called by the several appellations of
      Jack, Jonathan, and Mr. Lamb&mdash;mister!&mdash;but who was really such a
      cock-o'-my-thumb as might have been served up in a tureen, or baked in a
      pie-dish, without in the slightest degree abridging his personal
      dimensions. I have known him quite hidden behind a china jar, and as
      completely buried, whilst standing on tip-toe, in a crate, as the
      dessert-service which he was engaged in unpacking. Whether this pair of
      originals was transferred from a show at a fair to Miss Philips warehouse,
      or whether she had picked them up accidentally, first one and then the
      other, guided by a fine sense of congruity, as she might match a wineglass
      or a tea-cup, must be left to conjecture. Certain they answered her
      purpose, as well as if they had been the size of Gog and Magog; were
      attentive to the customers, faithful to their employer, and crept about
      amongst the china as softly as two mice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world went well with Miss Philly Firkin in the shop and out She won
      favour in the sight of her betters by a certain prim, demure, simpering
      civility, and a power of multiplying herself as well as her little
      officials, like Yates or Matthews in a monopolologue, and attending to
      half-a-dozen persons at once; whilst she was no less popular amongst her
      equals in virtue of her excellent gift in gossiping. Nobody better loved a
      gentle tale of scandal, to sweeten a quiet cup of tea. Nobody evinced a
      finer talent for picking up whatever news happened to be stirring, or
      greater liberality in its diffusion. She was the intelligencer of the
      place&mdash;a walking chronicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, Miss Philly Firkin was certainly a prosperous, and, as times
      go, a tolerably happy woman. To be sure, her closest intimates, those very
      dear friends, who as our confidence gives them the opportunity, are so
      obliging as to watch our weaknesses and report our foibles,&mdash;certain
      of these bosom companions had been heard to hint, that Miss Philly, who
      had refused two or three good matches in her bloom, repented her of this
      cruelty, and would probably be found less obdurate now that suitors had
      ceased to offer. This, if true, was one hidden grievance, a flitting
      shadow upon a sunny destiny; whilst another might be found in a
      circumstance of which she was so far from making a secret, that it was one
      of her most frequent topics of discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calamity in question took the not un-frequent form of a next-door
      neighbour. On her right dwelt an eminent tinman with his pretty daughter,
      two of the most respectable, kindest, and best-conducted persons in the
      town; but on her left was an open bricked archway, just wide enough to
      admit a cart, surmounted by a dim and dingy representation of some horned
      animal, with "The Old Red Cow" written in white capitals above, and "James
      Tyler, licensed to sell beer, ale, wine, and all sorts of spirituous
      liquors," below; and down the aforesaid passage, divided only by a paling
      from the spacious premises where her earthenware and coarser kinds ef
      crockery were deposited, were the public-house, stables, cowhouses, and
      pigsties of Mr. James Tyler, who added to his calling of publican, the
      several capacities of milkman, cattle dealer, and pig merchant, so that
      the place was one constant scene of dirt and noise and bustle without and
      within;&mdash;this Old Red Cow, in spite of its unpromising locality,
      being one of the best frequented houses in Belford, the constant resort of
      drovers, drivers, and cattle dealers, with a market dinner on Wednesdays
      and Saturdays, and a club called the Jolly Tailors, every Monday night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master James Tyler&mdash;popularly called Jem&mdash;was the very man to
      secure and increase this sort of custom. Of vast stature and extraordinary
      physical power, combined with a degree of animal spirits not often found
      in combination with such large proportions, he was at once a fit ruler
      over his four-footed subjects in the yard, a miscellaneous and most
      disorderly collection of cows, horses, pigs, and oxen, to say nothing of
      his own five boys, (for Jem was a widower,) each of whom, in striving to
      remedy, was apt to enhance the confusion, and an admirable lord of misrule
      at the drovers' dinners and tradesmen's suppers over which he presided.
      There was a mixture of command and good-humour, of decision and fun, in
      the gruff, bluff, weather-beaten countenance, surmounted with its rough
      shock of coal-black hair, and in the voice loud as a stentor, with which
      he now guided a drove of oxen, and now roared a catch, that his listeners
      in either case found irresistible. Jem Tyler was the very spirit of vulgar
      jollity, and could, as he boasted, run, leap, box, wrestle, drink, sing,
      and shoot (he had been a keeper in his youth, and still retained the love
      of sportsmanship which those who imbibe it early seldom lose) with any man
      in the county. He was discreet, too, for a man of his occupation; knew
      precisely how drunk a journeyman tailor ought to get, and when to stop a
      fight between a Somersetshire cattle-dealer and an Irish pig-driver. No
      inquest had ever sat upon any of his customers. Small wonder, that with
      such a landlord the Old Red Cow should be a hostelry of unmatched resort
      and unblemished reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief exception to Jem Tyler's almost universal popularity was beyond
      all manner of doubt his fair neighbour Miss Philadelphia Firkin. She,
      together with her trusty adherents, Miss Wolfe and Mr. Lamb, held Jem, his
      alehouse, and his customers, whether tailor, drover, or dealer, his yard
      and its contents, horse or donkey, ox or cow, pig or dog, in unmeasured
      and undisguised abhorrence: she threatened to indict the place as a
      nuisance, to appeal to the mayor; and upon "some good-natured friend"
      telling her that mine host had snapped his fingers at her as a chattering
      old maid, she did actually go so far as to speak to her landlord, who was
      also Jem's, upon the iniquity of his doings. This worthy happening,
      however, to be a great brewer, knew better than to dismiss a tenant whose
      consumption of double X was so satisfactory. So that Miss Firkin took
      nothing by her motion beyond a few of those smoothen-ing and pacificatory
      speeches, which, when administered to a person in a passion, have, as I
      have often observed, a remarkable tendency to exasperate the disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, however, came a real and substantial grievance, an actionable
      trespass; and although Miss Philly was a considerable loser by the
      mischance, and a lawsuit is always rather a questionable remedy for
      pecuniary damage, yet such was the keenness of her hatred towards poor
      Jem, that I am quite convinced that in her inmost heart (although being an
      excellent person in her way, it is doubtful whether she told herself the
      whole truth in the matter) she rejoiced at a loss which would enable her
      to take such signal vengeance over her next-door enemy. An obstreperous
      cow, walking backward instead of forward, as that placid animal when
      provoked has the habit of doing, came in contact with a weak part of the
      paling which divided Miss Firkin's back premises from Master Tyler's yard,
      and not only upset Mr. Lamb into a crate of crockery which he was in the
      act of unpacking, to the inexpressible discomfiture of both parties, but
      Miss Wolfe, who, upon hearing the mixture of crash and squall, ran to the
      rescue, found herself knocked down by a donkey who had entered at the
      breach, and was saluted as she rose by a peal of laughter from young Sam
      Tyler, Jem's eldest hope, a thorough Pickle, who, accompanied by two or
      three other chaps as unlucky as himself, sat quietly on a gate surveying
      and enjoying the mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll bring an action against the villain!" ejaculated Miss Philly, as
      soon as the enemy was driven from her quarters, and her china and her
      dependants set upon their feet:&mdash;"I'll take the law of him!" And in
      this spirited resolution did mistress, shopman, and shopwoman, find
      comfort for the losses, the scratches, and the bruises of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      This affray commenced on a Thursday evening towards the latter end of
      March; and it so happened that we had occasion to send to Miss Philly
      early the next morning for a cart-load of garden-pots for the use of my
      geraniums.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our messenger was, as it chanced, a certain lad byname Dick Barnett, who
      has lived with us off and on ever since he was the height of the table,
      and who originally a saucy, lively, merry boy, arch, quick-witted, and
      amusing, has been indulged in giving vent to all manner of impertinences
      until he has become a sort of privileged person, and takes, with high or
      low, a freedom of speech that might become a lady's page or a king's
      jester. Every now and then we feel that this licence, which in a child of
      ten years old we found so diverting, has become inconvenient in a youth of
      seventeen, and favour him and ourselves with a lecture accordingly. But
      such is the force of inveterate habit that our remonstrances upon this
      subject are usually so much gravity wasted upon him and upon ourselves.
      He, in the course of a day or two, comes forth with some fresh prank more
      amusing than before, and we (I grieve to confess such a weakness) resume
      our laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do justice, however, to this modern Robin Goodfellow, there was most
      commonly a fund of goodnature at the bottom of his wildest tricks or his
      most egregious romances,&mdash;for in the matter of a jest he was apt to
      draw pretty largely from an inventive faculty of remarkable fertility; he
      was constant in his attachments, whether to man or beast, loyal to his
      employers, and although idle and uncertain enough in other work, admirable
      in all that related to the stable or the kennel&mdash;the best driver,
      best rider, best trainer of a greyhound, and best finder of a hare, in all
      Berkshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, as usual, accompanied on this errand by one of his four-footed
      favourites, a delicate snow-white greyhound called Mayfly, of whom Miss
      Philly flatteringly observed, that "she was as beautiful as china;" and
      upon the civil lady of the shop proceeding to inquire after the health of
      his master and mistress, and the general news of Aberleigh, master Ben,
      who well knew her proficiency in gossiping, and had the dislike of a man
      and a rival to any female practitioner in that art, checked at once this
      condescending overture to conversation by answering with more than his
      usual consequence: "The chief news that I know, Miss Firkin, is, that our
      geraniums are all pining away for want of fresh earth, and that I am sent
      in furious haste after a load of your best garden-pots. There's no time to
      be lost, I can tell you, if you mean to save their precious lives. Miss
      Ada is upon her last legs, and master Diomede in a galloping consumption&mdash;two
      of our prime geraniums, ma'am!" quoth Dick, with a condescending nod to
      Miss Wolfe, as that Lilliputian lady looked up at him with a stare of
      unspeakable mystification; "queerish names, a'tot they? Well, there are
      the patterns of the sizes, and there's the order; so if your little
      gentleman will but look the pots out, I have left the cart in Jem Tyler's
      yard, (I've a message to Jem from master,) and we can pack 'em over the
      paling. I suppose you've a ladder for the little man's use, in loading
      carts and waggons, if not Jem or I can take them from him. There is not a
      better-natured fellow in England than Jem Tyler, and he'll be sure to do
      me a good turn any day, if it's only for the love of our Mayfly here. He
      bred her, poor thing, and is well nigh as fond of her as if she was a
      child of his own; and so's Sam. Nay, what's the matter with you all?"
      pursued Dick, as at the name of Jem Tyler Miss Wolfe turned up her hands
      and eyes, Mr. Lamb let fall the pattern pots, and Miss Philly flung the
      order upon the counter&mdash;"What the deuce is come to the people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then out burst the story of the last night's adventure, of Mr. Lamb's
      scratched face, which indeed was visible enough, of Miss Wolfe's bruises,
      of the broken china, the cow, the donkey, and the action at law.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whew!" whistled Dick in an aside whistle; "going to law is she? We must
      pacify her if we can," thought he, "for a lawsuit's no joke, as poor Jem
      would find. Jem must come and speechify. It's hard if between us we can't
      manage a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sad affair, indeed, Miss Firkin," said Dick, aloud, in a soft,
      sympathising tone, and with a most condoling countenance; "it's unknown
      what obstropolous creatures cows and donkies are, and what mischief they
      do amongst gim-cracks. A brute of a donkey got into our garden last
      summer, and ate up half-a-dozen rose-trees and fuchsias, besides trampling
      over the flower-beds. One of the roses was a present from France, worth
      five guineas. I hope Mr. Lamb and Miss Wolfe are not much hurt. Very sad
      affair! strange too that it should happen through Jem Tylers cattle&mdash;poor
      Jem, who had such a respect for you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Respect for me!" echoed Miss Philly, "when he called me a chattering old
      maid,&mdash;Mrs. Loveit heard him. Respect for me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye," continued Dick, "it was but last Monday was a fortnight that Kit
      Mahony, the tall pig-dealer, was boasting of the beauty of the Tipperary
      lasses, and crying down our English ladies, whereupon, although the tap
      was full of Irish chaps, Jem took the matter up, and swore that he could
      show Kit two as fine women in this very street&mdash;you, ma'am, being
      one, and Miss Parsons the other&mdash;two as fine women as ever he saw in
      Tipperary. Nay, he offered to lay any wager, from a pot of double X to
      half a score of his own pigs, that Kit should confess it himself. Now, if
      that's not having a respect I don't know what is," added Dick, with much
      gravity; "and I put it to your good sense, whether it is not more likely
      that Mrs. Loveit, who is as deaf as a post, should be mistaken, than that
      he should offer to lay such a wager respecting a lady of whom he had
      spoken so disparagingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This will do," thought Dick to himself as he observed the softening of
      Miss Philly's features and noted her very remarkable and unnatural silence&mdash;"this
      will do;" and reiterating his request that the order might be got ready,
      he walked out of the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll find that I have settled the matter," observed the young gentleman
      to Jem Tyler, after telling him the story, "and you have nothing to do but
      to follow up my hints. Did not I manage her famously? 'Twas well I
      recollected your challenge to Mahony, about that pretty creature, Harriet
      Parsons. It had a capital effect, I promise you. Now go and make yourself
      decent; put on your Sunday coat, wash your face and hands, and don't,
      spare for fine speeches. Be off with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall laugh in her face," replied Jem.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not you," quoth his sage adviser: "just think of the length of a lawyer's
      bill, and you'll be in no danger of laughing. Besides, she's really a
      niceish sort of a body enough, a tidyish little soul in her way, and
      you're a gay widower&mdash;so who knows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And home went Dick, chuckling all the way, partly at his own good
      management, partly at the new idea which his quick fancy had started.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a fortnight after, I had occasion to drive into Belford, attended as
      usual by master Richard. The bells of St. Stephen's were ringing merrily
      as we passed down Oriel Street, and happening to look up at the well-known
      sign of the Old Red Cow, we saw that celebrated work of art surmounted by
      a bow of white ribbons&mdash;a bridal favour. Looking onward to Miss
      Philly's door, what should we perceive but Mr. Lamb standing on the step
      with a similar cockade, half as big as himself, stuck in his hat; whilst
      Miss Wolfe stood simpering behind the counter, dispensing to her old enemy
      Sam, and four other grinning boys in their best apparel, five huge slices
      of bridecake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was clear. Jem Tyler and Miss Philly were married.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
