    "When I read the book, the biography famous,
    And is this then (said I) what the author calls a man's life?
    And so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life?
      (As if any man really knew aught of my life!)
    Why even I myself, I often think, know little or nothing of my real life.
    Only a few hints       a few diffused faint clues and indirections
    I seek ... to trace out here."

    For years I have contemplated telling this story, and for years I have
    put off telling it. While I have delayed, my memory has not improved,
    and my recollections of the past are more hazy and fragmentary than when
    it first occurred to me that one day I might write them down.


    My bad memory would matter less if I had some skill in writing       the
    practiced writer can see possibilities in the most ordinary events       or
    if I had kept a systematic and conscientious record of my life. But
    although I was at one time conscientious and diligent enough in keeping
    a diary, I kept it for use at the moment, not for future reference. I
    kept it with paste-pot and scissors as much as with a pen. My method was
    to cut bits out of the newspapers and stick them into my diary day by
    day. Before the end of the year was reached Mr. Letts would have been
    ashamed to own his diary. It had become a bursting, groaning dust-bin of
    information, for the most part useless. The biggest elastic band made
    could hardly encircle its bulk, swelled by photographs, letters,
    telegrams, dried flowers       the whole making up a confusion in which every
    one but the owner would seek in vain to find some sense or meaning.


    About six years ago I moved into a smaller house in London, and I burnt
    a great many of my earlier diaries as unmovable rubbish. The few
    passages which I shall quote in this book from those which escaped
    destruction will prove that my bonfire meant no great loss!


    Still, when it was suggested to me in the year of my stage jubilee that
    I ought to write down my recollections, I longed for those diaries! I
    longed for anything which would remind me of the past and make it live
    again for me. I was frightened. Something would be expected of me, since
    I could not deny that I had had an eventful life packed full of
    incident, and that by the road I had met many distinguished and
    interesting men and women. I could not deny that I had been fifty years
    on the stage, and that this meant enough material for fifty books, if
    only the details of every year could be faithfully told. But it is not
    given to all of us to see our lives in relief as we look back. Most of
    us, I think, see them in perspective, of which our birth is the
    vanishing point. Seeing, too, is only half the battle. How few people
    can describe what they see!


    While I was thinking in this obstructive fashion and wishing that I
    could write about my childhood like Tolstoi, about my girlhood like
    Marie Bashkirtseff, and about the rest of my days and my work like many
    other artists of the pen, who merely, by putting black upon white, have
    had the power to bring before their readers not merely themselves "as
    they lived," but the most homely and intimate details of their lives,
    the friend who had first impressed on me that I ought not to leave my
    story untold any longer, said that the beginning was easy enough: "What
    is the first thing you remember? Write that down as a start."


    But for my friend's practical suggestion it is doubtful if I should ever
    have written a line! He relieved my anxiety about my powers of compiling
    a stupendous autobiography, and made me forget that writing was a new
    art, to me, and that I was rather old to try my hand at a new art. My
    memory suddenly began to seem not so bad after all. For weeks I had
    hesitated between Othello's "Nothing extenuate, nor write down aught in
    malice," and Pilate's "What is truth?" as my guide and my apology. Now I
    saw that both were too big for my modest endeavor. I was not leaving a
    human document for the benefit of future psychologists and historians,
    but telling as much of my story as I could remember to the good, living
    public which has been considerate and faithful to me for so many years.


    How often it has made allowances for me when I was nervous on first
    nights! With what patience it has waited long and uncomfortable hours to
    see me! Surely its charity would quickly cover my literary sins.


    I gave up the search for a motto which should express my wish to tell
    the truth so far as I know it, to describe things as I see them, to be
    faithful according to my light, not dreading the abuse of those who
    might see in my light nothing but darkness.


    I shut up "Othello" and did not try to verify the remark of "jesting"
    Pilate. The only instruction that I gave myself was to "begin at the
    beginning."

    THE STORY OF MY LIFE


    I
    A CHILD OF THE STAGE
    1848-1856


    This is the first thing I remember.


    In the corner of a lean-to whitewashed attic stood a fine, plain, solid
    oak bureau. By climbing up on to this bureau I could see from the window
    the glories of the sunset. My attic was on a hill in a large and busy
    town, and the smoke of a thousand chimneys hung like a gray veil between
    me and the fires in the sky. When the sun had set, and the scarlet and
    gold, violet and primrose, and all those magic colors that have no
    names, had faded into the dark, there were other fires for me to see.
    The flaming forges came out, and terrified while they fascinated my
    childish imagination.


    What did it matter to me that I was locked in and that my father and
    mother, with my elder sister Kate, were all at the theater? I had the
    sunset, the forges, and the oak bureau.


    I cannot say how old I was at this time, but I am sure that it wasn't
    long after my birth (which I can't remember, although I have often been
    asked to decide in which house at Coventry I was born!). At any rate, I
    had not then seen a theater, and I took to the stage before many years
    had passed over my head.


    Putting together what I remembered, and such authentic history as there
    is of my parents' movements, I gather that this attic was in theatrical
    lodgings in Glasgow. My father was an actor, my mother an actress, and
    they were at this time on tour in Scotland. Perhaps this is the place to
    say that father was the son of an Irish builder, and that he eloped in a
    chaise with mother, who was the daughter of a Scottish minister. I am
    afraid I know no details of their romance. As for my less immediate
    ancestry, it is "wropt in mystery." Were we all people of the stage?
    There was a Daniel Terry who was not only a famous actor in his day, but
    a friend of Sir Walter Scott's. There was an
    Eliza Terry, an actress
    whose portrait appears in The Dramatic Mirror in 1847. But so far as I
    know I cannot claim kinship with either Eliza or Daniel.


          






          MR. AND MRS. BENJAMIN TERRY


    The father and mother of Ellen Terry

    from a photograph by Lewis Carroll

          

    I have a very dim recollection of anything that happened in the attic,
    beyond the fact that when my father and mother went to the theater every
    night, they used to put me to bed and that directly their backs were
    turned and the door locked, I used to jump up and go to the window. My
    "bed" consisted of the mattress pulled off their bed and laid on the
    floor       on father's side. Both my father and my mother were very kind and
    devoted parents (though severe at times, as all good parents are), but
    while mother loved all her children too well to make favorites, I was, I
    believe, my father's particular pet. I used to sleep all night holding
    his hand.


    One night I remember waking up to find a beautiful face bending over me.
    Father was holding a candle so that the visitor might see me better, and
    gradually I realized that the face belonged to some one in a brown silk
    dress       the first silk dress that I had ever seen. This being from
    another world had brown eyes and brown hair, which looked to me very
    dark, because we were a white lot, very fair indeed. I shall never
    forget that beautiful vision of this well-dressed woman with her lovely
    complexion and her gold chain round her neck. It was my Aunt Lizzie.


    I hold very strongly that a child's earliest impressions mould its
    character perhaps more than either heredity or education. I am sure it
    is true in my case. What first impressed me? An attic, an oak bureau, a
    lovely face, a bed on the floor. Things have come and gone in my life
    since then, but they have been powerless to efface those early
    impressions. I adore pretty faces. I can't keep away from shops where
    they sell good old furniture like my bureau. I like plain rooms with low
    ceilings better than any other rooms; and for my afternoon siesta, which
    is one of my institutions, I often choose the floor in preference to bed
    or sofa.


    What we remember in our childhood and what we are told afterwards often
    become inextricably confused in our minds, and after the bureau and Aunt
    Lizzie, my memory is a blank for some years. I can't even tell you when
    it was first decided that I was to go on the stage, but I expect it was
    when I was born, for in those days theatrical folk did not imagine that
    their children could do anything but follow their parents' profession.


    I must depend now on hearsay for certain facts. The first fact is my
    birth, which should, perhaps, have been mentioned before anything else.
    To speak by the certificate, I was born on the 27th of February, 1848,
    at Coventry. Many years afterwards, when people were kind enough to
    think that the house in which I was born deserved to be discovered,
    there was a dispute as to which house in Market Street could claim me.
    The dispute was left unsettled in rather a curious way. On one side of
    the narrow street a haberdasher's shop bore the inscription, "Birthplace
    of Ellen Terry." On the other, an eating-house declared itself to be
    "the original birthplace"! I have never been able to arbitrate in the
    matter, my statement that my mother had always said that the house was
    "on the right-hand side, coming from the market-place," being apparently
    of no use. I have heard lately that one of the birthplaces has retired
    from the competition, and that the haberdasher has the field to himself.
    I am glad, for the sake of those friends of mine who have bought his
    handkerchiefs and ties as souvenirs. There is, however, nothing very
    attractive about the house itself. It is better built than a house of
    the same size would be built now, and it has a certain old-fashioned
    respectability, but that is the end of its praises. Coventry itself
    makes up for the deficiency. It is a delightful town, and it was a happy
    chance that made me a native of Warwickshire, Shakespeare's own county.
    Sarah Kemble married Mr. Siddons at Coventry too       another happy omen.


    I have acted twice in my native town in old days, but never in recent
    years. In 1904 I planned to act there again, but unfortunately I was
    taken ill at Cambridge, and the doctors would not allow me to go to
    Coventry. The morning my company left Cambridge without me, I was very
    miserable. It is always hateful to disappoint the public, and on this
    occasion I was compelled to break faith where I most wished to keep it.
    I heard afterwards from my daughter (who played some of my parts
    instead of me) that many of the Coventry people thought I had never
    meant to come at all. If this should meet their eyes, I hope they will
    believe that this was not so. My ambition to play at Coventry again
    shall be realized yet.1


    At one time nothing seemed more unlikely than that I should be able to
    act in another Warwickshire town, a town whose name is known all over
    the world. But time and chance and my own great wish succeeded in
    bringing about my appearance at Stratford-on-Avon.


    I can well imagine that the children of some strolling players used to
    have a hard time of it, but my mother was not one to shirk her duties.
    She worked hard at her profession and yet found it possible not to
    drag up her children, to live or die as it happened, but to bring them
    up to be healthy, happy, and wise       theater-wise, at any rate. When her
    babies were too small to be left at the lodgings (which she and my
    father took in each town they visited as near to the theater as
    possible), she would bundle us up in a shawl and put us to sleep in her
    dressing-room. So it was, that long before I spoke in a theater, I slept
    in one.


    Later on, when we were older and mother could leave us at home, there
    was a fire one night at our lodgings, and she rushed out of the theater
    and up the street in an agony of terror. She got us out of the house all
    right, took us to the theater, and went on with the next act as if
    nothing had happened. Such fortitude is commoner in our profession, I
    think, than in any other. We "go on with the next act" whatever
    happens, and if we know our business, no one in the audience will ever
    guess that anything is wrong       that since the curtain last went down some
    dear friend has died, or our children in the theatrical lodgings up the
    street have run the risk of being burnt to death.


    My mother had eleven children altogether, but only nine survived their
    infancy, and of these nine, my eldest brother, Ben, and my sister
    Florence have since died. My sister Kate, who left the stage at an age
    when most of the young women of the present day take to it for the first
    time, and made an enduring reputation in a few brilliant years, was the
    eldest of the family. Then came a sister, who died, and I was the third.
    After us came Ben, George, Marion, Flossie, Charles, Tom, and Fred. Six
    out of the nine have been on the stage, but only Marion, Fred, and I are
    there still.


    Two or three members of this large family, at the most, were in
    existence when I first entered a theater in a professional capacity, so
    I will leave them all alone for the present. I had better confess at
    once that I don't remember this great event, and my sister Kate is
    unkind enough to say that it never happened       to me! The story, she
    asserts, was told of her. But without damning proofs she is not going to
    make me believe it! Shall I be robbed of the only experience of my first
    eight years of life? Never!


    During the rehearsals of a pantomime in a Scottish town (Glasgow, I
    think. Glasgow has always been an eventful place to me!), a child was
    wanted for the Spirit of the Mustard-pot. What more natural than that
    my
    father should offer my services? I had a shock of pale yellow hair, I
    was small enough to be put into the property mustard-pot, and the
    Glasgow stage manager would easily assume that I had inherited talent.
    My father had acted with Macready in the stock seasons both at
    Edinburgh
    and Glasgow, and bore a very high reputation with Scottish audiences.
    But the stage manager and father alike reckoned without their actress!
    When they tried to put me into the mustard-pot, I yelled lustily and
    showed more lung-power than aptitude for the stage.


    "Pit your child into the mustard-pot, Mr. Terry," said the stage
    manager.


    "D       n you and your mustard-pot, sir!" said my mortified father. "I won't
    frighten my child for you or anyone else!"


    But all the same he was bitterly disappointed at my first dramatic
    failure, and when we reached home he put me in the corner to chasten me.
    "You'll never make an actress!" he said, shaking a reproachful finger
    at me.


    It is my mustard-pot, and why Kate should want it, I can't think! She
    hadn't yellow hair, and she couldn't possibly have behaved so badly. I
    have often heard my parents say significantly that they had no trouble
    with Kate! Before she was four, she was dancing a hornpipe in a
    sailor's jumper, a rakish little hat, and a diminutive pair of white
    ducks! Those ducks, marked "Kate Terry," were kept by mother for years
    as a precious relic, and are, I hope, still in the family archives!


    I stick to the mustard-pot, but I entirely disclaim the little Duke of
    York in Richard III., which some one with a good memory stoutly insists
    he saw me play before I made my first appearance as Mamilius. Except
    for this abortive attempt at Glasgow, I was never on any stage even for
    a rehearsal until 1856, at the Princess's Theater, when I appeared with
    Charles Kean in "A Winter's Tale."


    The man with the memory may have seen Kate as one of the Princes in the
    Tower, but he never saw me with her. Kate was called up to London in
    1852 to play Prince Arthur in Charles Kean's production of "King John,"
    and after that she acted in all his plays, until he gave up management
    in 1859. She had played Arthur during a stock season at Edinburgh, and
    so well that some one sang her praises to Kean and advised him to engage
    her. My mother took Kate to London, and I was left with my father in the
    provinces for two years. I can't recall much about those two years
    except sunsets and a great mass of shipping looming up against the sky.
    The sunsets followed me about everywhere; the shipping was in
    Liverpool,
    where father was engaged for a considerable time. He never ceased
    teaching me to be useful, alert, and quick. Sometimes he hastened my
    perceptive powers with a slipper, and always he corrected me if I
    pronounced any word in a slipshod fashion. He himself was a beautiful
    elocutionist, and if I now speak my language well it is in no small
    degree due to my early training.


    It was to his elocution that father owed his engagement with
    Macready,
    of whom he always spoke in terms of the most affectionate admiration in
    after years, and probably it did him a good turn again with Charles
    Kean. An actor who had supported Macready with credit was just the actor
    likely to be useful to a manager who was producing a series of plays by
    Shakespeare. Kate had been a success at the Princess's, too, in child
    parts, and this may have reminded Mr. Kean to send for Kate's father! At
    any rate he was sent for towards the end of the year 1853 and left
    Liverpool for London. I know I cooked his breakfasts for him in
    Liverpool, but I haven't the slightest recollection of the next two
    years in London. As I am determined not to fill up the early blanks with
    stories of my own invention, I must go straight on to 1856, when
    rehearsals were called at the Princess's Theater for Shakespeare's
    "Winter's Tale."

    THE CHARLES KEANS
    1856


    The Charles Keans from whom I received my first engagement, were both
    remarkable people, and at the Princess Theater were doing very
    remarkable work. Kean the younger had not the fire and genius of his
    wonderful father, Edmund, and but for the inherited splendor of his name
    it is not likely that he would ever have attained great eminence as an
    actor. His Wolsey and his Richard (the Second, not the Third) were his
    best parts, perhaps because in them his beautiful diction had full scope
    and his limitations were not noticeable. But it is more as a stage
    reformer than as an actor that he will be remembered. The old
    happy-go-lucky way of staging plays, with its sublime indifference to
    correctness of detail and its utter disregard of archaeology, had
    received its first blow from Kemble and Macready, but Charles Kean gave
    it much harder knocks and went further than either of them in the good
    work.



          







          

    CHARLES KEAN AND ELLEN TERRY IN 1856

    As they appeared in       The Winter's Tale.       This was Miss Terry's début on the
    stage.

          

    It is an old story and a true one that when Edmund Kean made his first
    great success as Shylock, after a long and miserable struggle as a
    strolling player, he came home to his wife and said: "You shall ride in
    your carriage," and then, catching up his little son, added, "and
    Charley shall go to Eton!" Well, Charley did go to Eton, and if Eton did
    not make him a great actor, it opened his eyes to the absurd
    anachronisms in costumes and accessories which prevailed on the stage at
    that period, and when he undertook the management of the Princess's
    Theater, he turned his classical education to account. In addition to
    scholarly knowledge, he had a naturally refined taste and the power of
    selecting the right man to help him. Planché, the great authority on
    historical costumes, was one of his ablest coadjutors, and
    Mr. Bradshaw
    designed all the properties. It has been said lately that I began my
    career on an unfurnished stage, when the play was the thing, and
    spectacle was considered of small importance. I take this opportunity of
    contradicting that statement most emphatically. Neither when I began nor
    yet later in my career have I ever played under a management where
    infinite pains were not given to every detail. I think that far from
    hampering the acting, a beautiful and congruous background and
    harmonious costumes, representing accurately the spirit of the time in
    which the play is supposed to move, ought to help and inspire the actor.


    Such thoughts as these did not trouble my head when I acted with the
    Keans, but, child as I was, the beauty of the productions at the
    Princess's Theater made a great impression on me, and my memory of them
    is quite clear enough, even if there were not plenty of other evidence,
    for me to assert that in some respects they were even more elaborate
    than those of the present day. I know that the bath-buns of one's
    childhood always seem in memory much bigger and better than the buns
    sold nowadays, but even allowing for the natural glamor which the years
    throw over buns and rooms, places and plays alike, I am quite certain
    that Charles Kean's productions of Shakespeare would astonish the modern
    critic who regards the period of my first appearance as a sort of
    dark-age in the scenic art of the theater.


    I have alluded to the beauty of Charles Kean's diction. His voice was
    also of a wonderful quality       soft and low, yet distinct and clear as a
    bell. When he played Richard II. the magical charm of this organ was
    alone enough to keep the house spellbound. His vivid personality made a
    strong impression on me. Yet others only remember that he called his
    wife "Delly," though she was Nelly, and always spoke as if he had a cold
    in his head. How strange! If I did not understand what suggested
    impressions so different from my own, they would make me more indignant.

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
"Now who shall arbitrate?
Ten men love what I hate,
Shun what I follow, slight what I receive.
Ten who in ears and eyes
Match me; they all surmise,
They this thing, and I that:
Whom shall my soul believe?"

              
            
          
        
      
    
  


    What he owed to Mrs. Kean, he would have been the first to confess. In
    many ways she was the leading spirit in the theater; at the least, a
    joint ruler, not a queen-consort. During the rehearsals Mr. Kean used
    to sit in the stalls with a loud-voiced dinner-bell by his side, and
    when anything went wrong on the stage, he would ring it ferociously, and
    everything would come to a stop, until Mrs. Kean, who always sat on the
    stage, had set right what was wrong. She was more formidable than
    beautiful to look at, but her wonderful fire and genius were none the
    less impressive because she wore a white handkerchief round her head and
    had a very beaky nose! How I admired and loved and feared her! Later on
    the fear was replaced by gratitude, for no woman ever gave herself more
    trouble to train a young actress than did Mrs. Kean. The love and
    admiration, I am glad to say, remained and grew. It is rare that it
    falls to the lot of anyone to have such an accomplished teacher. Her
    patience and industry were splendid.


    It was Mrs. Kean who chose me out of five or six other children to play
    my first part. We were all tried in it, and when we had finished, she
    said the same thing to us all: "That's very nice! Thank you, my dear.
    That will do."


    We none of us knew at the time which of us had pleased her most.


    At this time we were living in the upper part of a house in the Gower
    Street region. That first home in London I remember chiefly by its fine
    brass knocker, which mother kept beautifully bright, and by its being
    the place to which I was sent my first part! Bound in green American
    cloth, it looked to me more marvelous than the most priceless book has
    ever looked since! I was so proud and pleased and delighted that I
    danced a hornpipe for joy!


    Why was I chosen, and not one of the other children, for the part of
    Mamilius? some one may ask. It was not mere luck, I think. Perhaps I was
    a born actress, but that would have served me little if I had not been
    able to speak! It must be remembered that both my sister Kate and I
    had been trained almost from our birth for the stage, and particularly
    in the important branch of clear articulation. Father, as I have already
    said, was a very charming elocutionist, and my mother read Shakespeare
    beautifully. They were both very fond of us and saw our faults with eyes
    of love, though they were unsparing in their corrections. In these early
    days they had need of all their patience, for I was a most troublesome,
    wayward pupil. However, "the labor we delight in physics pain," and I
    hope, too, that my more staid sister made it up to them!


    The rehearsals for "A Winter's Tale" were a lesson in fortitude. They
    taught me once and for all that an actress's life (even when the actress
    is only eight) is not all beer and skittles, or cakes and ale, or fame
    and glory. I was cast for the part of Mamilius in the way I have
    described, and my heart swelled with pride when I was told what I had to
    do, when I realized that I had a real Shakespeare part       a possession
    that father had taught me to consider the pride of life!


    But many weary hours were to pass before the first night. If a company
    has to rehearse four hours a day now, it is considered a great hardship,
    and players must lunch and dine like other folk. But this was not Kean's
    way! Rehearsals lasted all day, Sundays included, and when there was no
    play running at night, until four or five the next morning! I don't
    think any actor in those days dreamed of luncheon. (Tennyson, by the
    way, told me to say "luncheon"       not "lunch.") How my poor little legs
    used to ache! Sometimes I could hardly keep my eyes open when I was on
    the stage, and often when my scene was over, I used to creep into the
    greenroom and forget my troubles and my art (if you can talk of art in
    connection with a child of eight) in a delicious sleep.


    At the dress-rehearsals I did not want to sleep. All the members of the
    company were allowed to sit and watch the scenes in which they were not
    concerned, from the back of the dress-circle. This, by the way, is an
    excellent plan, and in theaters where it is followed the young actress
    has reason to be grateful. In these days of greater publicity when the
    press attend rehearsals, there may be strong reasons against the company
    being "in front," but the perfect loyalty of all concerned would dispose
    of these reasons. Now, for the first time, the beginner is able to see
    the effect of the weeks of thought and labor which have been given to
    the production. She can watch from the front the fulfillment of what she
    has only seen as intention and promise during the other rehearsals. But
    I am afraid that beginners now are not so keen as they used to be. The
    first wicked thing I did in a theater sprang from excess of keenness. I
    borrowed a knife from a carpenter and made a slit in the canvas to watch
    Mrs. Kean as Hermione!


    Devoted to her art, conscientious to a degree in mastering the spirit
    and details of her part, Mrs. Kean also possessed the personality and
    force to chain the attention and indelibly imprint her rendering of a
    part on the imagination. When I think of the costume in which she
    played Hermione, it seems marvelous to me that she could have produced
    the impression that she did. This seems to contradict what I have said
    about the magnificence of the production. But not at all! The designs of
    the dresses were purely classic; but then, as now, actors and actresses
    seemed unable to keep their own period and their own individuality out
    of the clothes directly they got them on their backs. In some cases the
    original design was quite swamped. No matter what the character that
    Mrs. Kean was assuming, she always used to wear her hair drawn flat over
    her forehead and twisted tight round her ears in a kind of circular
    sweep       such as the old writing-masters used to make when they attempted
    an extra grand flourish. And then the amount of petticoats she wore!
    Even as Hermione she was always bunched out by layer upon layer of
    petticoats, in defiance of the fact that classical parts should not be
    dressed in a superfluity of raiment. But if the petticoats were full of
    starch, the voice was full of pathos       and the dignity, simplicity, and
    womanliness of Mrs. Charles Kean's Hermione could not have been marred
    by a far more grotesque costume.


    There is something, I suppose, in a woman's nature which always makes
    her remember how she was dressed at any specially eventful moment of her
    life, and I can see myself, as though it were yesterday, in the little
    red-and-silver dress I wore as Mamilius. Mrs. Grieve, the
    dresser       "Peter Grieve-us," as we children called her       had pulled me
    into my very pink tights (they were by no means tight but very baggy,
    according to the pictures of me), and my mother had arranged my hair in
    sausage curls on each side of my head in even more perfect order and
    regularity than usual. Besides my clothes, I had a beautiful "property"
    to be proud of. This was a go-cart, which had been made in the theater
    by Mr. Bradshaw, and was an exact copy of a child's toy as depicted on a
    Greek vase. It was my duty to drag this little cart about the stage, and
    on the first night, when Mr. Kean as Leontes told me to "go play," I
    obeyed his instructions with such vigor that I tripped over the handle
    and came down on my back! A titter ran through the house, and I felt
    that my career as an actress was ruined forever. Even now I remember how
    bitterly I wept, and how deeply humiliated I felt. But the little
    incident, so mortifying to me, did not spoil my first appearance
    altogether. The Times of May 1, 1856, was kind enough to call me
    "vivacious and precocious," and "a worthy relative of my sister Kate,"
    and my parents were pleased (although they would not show it too much),
    and Mrs. Kean gave me a pat on the back. Father and Kate were both in
    the cast, too, I ought to have said, and the Queen, Prince Albert, and
    the Princess Royal were all in a box on the first night.


    To act for the first time in Shakespeare, in a theater where my sister
    had already done something for our name, and before royalty, was surely
    a good beginning.


    From April 28, 1856, I played Mamilius every night for one hundred and
    two nights. I was never ill, and my understudy, Clara Denvil, a very
    handsome, dark child with flaming eyes, though quite ready and longing
    to play my part, never had the chance.


    I had now taken the first step, but I had taken it without any notion of
    what I was doing. I was innocent of all art, and while I loved the
    actual doing of my part, I hated the labor that led up to it. But the
    time was soon to come when I was to be fired by a passion for work.
    Meanwhile I was unconsciously learning a number of lessons which were to
    be most useful to me in my subsequent career.


          


    
          
    ELLEN TERRY IN 1856
          
    TRAINING IN SHAKESPEARE
    1856-1859


    From April 1856 until 1859 I acted constantly at the Princess's Theater
    with the Keans, spending the summer holidays in acting at Ryde. My whole
    life was the theater, and naturally all my early memories are connected
    with it. At breakfast father would begin the day's "coaching." Often I
    had to lay down my fork and say my lines. He would conduct these extra
    rehearsals anywhere       in the street, the 'bus       we were never safe! I
    remember vividly going into a chemist's shop and being stood upon a
    stool to say my part to the chemist! Such leisure as I had from my
    profession was spent in "minding" the younger children       an occupation in
    which I delighted. They all had very pretty hair, and I used to wash it
    and comb it out until it looked as fine and bright as floss silk.


    It is argued now that stage life is bad for a young child, and children
    are not allowed by law to go on the stage until they are ten years
    old       quite a mature age in my young days! I cannot discuss the whole
    question here, and must content myself with saying that during my three
    years at the Princess's I was a very strong, happy, and healthy child. I
    was never out of the bill except during the run of "A Midsummer Night's
    Dream," when, through an unfortunate accident, I broke my toe. I was
    playing Puck, my second part on any stage, and had come up through a
    trap at the end of the last act to give the final speech. My sister
    Kate
    was playing Titania that night as understudy to Carlotta Leclercq. Up I
    came       but not quite up, for the man shut the trapdoor too soon and
    caught my toe. I screamed. Kate rushed to me and banged her foot on the
    stage, but the man only closed the trap tighter, mistaking the signal.


    "Oh, Katie! Katie!" I cried. "Oh, Nelly! Nelly!" said poor Kate
    helplessly. Then Mrs. Kean came rushing on and made them open the trap
    and release my poor foot.


    "Finish the play, dear," she whispered excitedly, "and I'll double your
    salary!" There was Kate holding me up on one side and Mrs. Kean on the
    other. Well, I did finish the play in a fashion. The text ran something
    like this       


  
    
      
        
          
            
"If we shadows have offended (Oh, Katie, Katie!)
Think but this, and all is mended, (Oh, my toe!)
That you have but slumbered here,
While these visions did appear. (I can't, I can't!)
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream, (Oh, dear! oh, dear!)
Gentles, do not reprehend; (A big sob)
If you pardon, we will mend. (Oh, Mrs. Kean!)"

            
          
        
      
    
  


    How I got through it, I don't know! But my salary was doubled       it had
    been fifteen shillings, and it was raised to thirty       and Mr. Skey,
    President of Bartholomew's Hospital, who chanced to be in a stall that
    very evening, came round behind the scenes and put my toe right. He
    remained my friend for life.


    I was not chosen for Puck because I had played Mamilius with some
    credit. The same examination was gone through, and again I came out
    first. During the rehearsals Mrs. Kean taught me to draw my breath in
    through my nose and begin a laugh       a very valuable accomplishment! She
    was also indefatigable in her lessons in clear enunciation, and I can
    hear her now lecturing the ladies of the company on their vowels. "A, E,
    I, O, U, my dear," she used to say, "are five distinct vowels, so don't
    mix them all up together, as if you were making a pudding. If you want
    to say, 'I am going on the river,' say it plainly and don't tell us you
    are going on the 'rivah!' You must say her, not har; it's God,
    not Gud: remonstrance, not remunstrance," and so forth. No one
    ever had a sharper tongue or a kinder heart than Mrs. Kean. Beginning
    with her, I have always loved women with a somewhat hard manner! I have
    never believed in their hardness, and have proved them tender and
    generous in the extreme.


    Actor-managers are very proud of their long runs nowadays, but in
    Shakespeare, at any rate, they do not often eclipse Charles
    Kean's two
    hundred and fifty nights of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the
    Princess's. It was certainly a very fascinating production, and many of
    the effects were beautiful. I, by the way, had my share in marring one
    of these during the run. When Puck was told to put a girdle round the
    earth in forty minutes, I had to fly off the stage as swiftly as I
    could, and a dummy Puck was whirled through the air from the point where
    I disappeared. One night the dummy, while in full flying action, fell on
    the stage, whereupon, in great concern for its safety, I ran on, picked
    it up in my arms, and ran off with it amid roars of laughter! Neither of
    the Keans was acting in this production, but there was some one in
    authority to give me a sound cuff. Yet I had such excellent intentions.
    'Tis ever thus!


    I reveled in Puck and his impish pranks, and unconsciously realized that
    it was a part in which the imagination could run riot. I believe I
    played it well, but I did not look well, and I must contradict
    emphatically the kind assumption that I must have been a "delightful
    little fairy." As Mamilius I was really a sweet little thing, but while
    I was playing Puck I grew very gawky       not to say ugly! My hair had been
    cut short, and my red cheeks stuck out too much. I was a sight!


    The parts we play influence our characters to some extent, and Puck made
    me a bit of a romp. I grew vain and rather "cocky," and it was just as
    well that during the rehearsals for the Christmas pantomime in 1857 I
    was tried for the part of the Fairy Dragonetta and rejected. I believe
    that my failure was principally due to the fact that Nature had not
    given me flashing eyes and raven hair       without which, as everyone knows,
    no bad fairy can hold up her head and respect herself. But at the time I
    felt distinctly rebuffed, and only the extreme beauty of my dress as the
    maudlin "good fairy" Goldenstar consoled me. Milly Smith (afterwards
    Mrs. Thorn) was Dragonetta, and one of her speeches ran like this:


  
    
      
        
"Ungrateful Simple Simon (darting forward) You thought no doubt to spite me!
That to this Royal Christening you did not invite me!
BUT       (Mrs. Kean: "You must plaster that 'but' on the white wall at the back of the gallery.")       
But on this puling brat revenged I'll be!
My fiery dragon there shall have her broiled for tea!"

        
      
    
  


    At Ryde during the previous summer my father had taken the theater, and
    Kate and I played in several farces which the Keeleys and the great
    comedian Robson had made famous in London. My performances as Waddilove
    and Jacob Earwig had provoked some one to describe me as "a perfect
    little heap of talent!" To fit my Goldenstar, I must borrow that phrase
    and describe myself as a perfect little heap of vanity.


    It was that dress! It was a long dress, though I was still a baby, and
    it was as pink and gold as it was trailing. I used to think I looked
    beautiful in it. I wore a trembling star on my forehead, too, which
    was enough to upset any girl!


    One of the most wearisome, yet essential details of my education is
    connected with my first long dress. It introduces, too, Mr. Oscar Byrn,
    the dancing-master and director of crowds at the Princess's. One of his
    lessons was in the art of walking with a flannel blanket pinned on in
    front and trailing six inches on the floor. My success in carrying out
    this maneuver with dignity won high praise from Mr. Byrn. The other
    children used to kick at the blanket and progress in jumps like young
    kangaroos, but somehow I never had any difficulty in moving gracefully.
    No wonder then that I impressed Mr. Byrn, who had a theory that "an
    actress was no actress unless she learned to dance early." Whenever he
    was not actually putting me through my paces, I was busy watching him
    teach the others. There was the minuet, to which he used to attach great
    importance, and there was "walking the plank." Up and down one of the
    long planks, extending the length of the stage, we had to walk first
    slowly and then quicker and quicker until we were able at a
    considerable pace to walk the whole length of it without deviating an
    inch from the straight line. This exercise, Mr. Byrn used to say, and
    quite truly, I think, taught us uprightness of carriage and certainty of
    step.


    "Eyes right! Chest out! Chin tucked in!" I can hear the dear old man
    shouting at us as if it were yesterday; and I have learned to see of
    what value all his drilling was, not only to deportment, but to clear
    utterance. It would not be a bad thing if there were more "old fops"
    like Oscar Byrn in the theaters of to-day. That old-fashioned art of
    "deportment" is sadly neglected.


    The pantomime in which I was the fairy Goldenstar was very frequently
    preceded by "A Midsummer Night's Dream," and the two parts on one night
    must have been fairly heavy work for a child, but I delighted in it.


    In the same year (1858) I played Karl in "Faust and Marguerite," a jolly
    little part with plenty of points in it, but not nearly as good a part
    as Puck. Progress on the stage is often crab-like, and little parts, big
    parts, and no parts at all must be accepted as "all in the day's work."
    In these days I was cast for many a "dumb" part. I walked on in "The
    Merchant of Venice" carrying a basket of doves; in "Richard II." I
    climbed up a pole in the street scene; in "Henry VIII." I was "top
    angel" in the vision, and I remember that the heat of the gas at that
    dizzy height made me sick at the dress-rehearsal! I was a little boy
    "cheering" in several other productions. In "King Lear" my sister Kate
    played Cordelia. She was only fourteen, and the youngest Cordelia on
    record. Years after I played it at the Lyceum when I was over forty!


    The production of "Henry VIII." at the Princess's was one of Charles
    Kean's best efforts. I always refrain from belittling the present at the
    expense of the past, but there were efforts here which I have never seen
    surpassed, and about this my memory is not at all dim. At this time I
    seem to have been always at the side watching the acting. Mrs. Kean's
    Katherine of Aragon was splendid, and Charles Kean's Wolsey, his best
    part after, perhaps, his Richard II. Still, the lady who used to stand
    ready with a tear-bottle to catch his tears as he came off after his
    last scene rather overdid her admiration. My mental criticism at the
    time was "What rubbish!" When I say in what parts Charles Kean was
    "best," I don't mean to be assertive. How should a mere child be able to
    decide? I "think back" and remember in what parts I liked him best, but
    I may be quite wide of the mark.


    In those days audiences liked plenty for their money, and a Shakespeare
    play was not nearly long enough to fill the bill. English playgoers in
    the early 'fifties did not emulate the Japanese, who go to the theater
    early in the morning and stay there until late at night, still less the
    Chinese, whose plays begin one week and end the next, but they thought
    nothing of sitting in the theater from seven to twelve. In one of the
    extra pieces which these hours necessitated, I played a "tiger," one of
    those youthful grooms who are now almost a bygone fashion. The pride
    that I had taken in my trembling star in the pantomime was almost
    equaled now by my pride in my top-boots! They were too small and caused
    me insupportable suffering, but I was so afraid that they would be taken
    away if I complained, that every evening I used to put up valorously
    with the torture. The piece was called "If the Cap Fits," but my boots
    were the fit with which I was most concerned!


    Years later the author of the little play, Mr. Edmund Yates, the editor
    of The World       wrote to me about my performance as the tiger:


  
    

                         When on June 13, 1859 (to no one else in the world would I breathe the date!) I saw a very young lady play a tiger in a comedietta of mine called 'If the Cap Fits,' I had no idea that that precocious child had in her the germ of such an artist as she has since proved herself. What I think of her performance of Portia she will see in The World.      

    
  

In "The Merchant of Venice" though I had no speaking part, I was firmly
    convinced that the basket of doves which I carried on my shoulder was
    the principal attraction of the scene in which it appeared. The other
    little boys and girls in the company regarded those doves with eyes of
    bitter envy. One little chorus boy, especially, though he professed a
    personal devotion of the tenderest kind for me, could never quite get
    over those doves, and his romantic sentiments cooled considerably when I
    gained my proud position as dove-bearer. Before, he had shared his
    sweets with me, but now he transferred both sweets and affections to
    some more fortunate little girl. Envy, after all, is the death of love! 

    Mr. Harley was the Launcelot Gobbo in "The Merchant of Venice"       an old
    gentleman, and almost as great a fop as Mr. Byrn. He was always smiling;
    his two large rows of teeth were so very good! And he had pompous,
    grandiloquent manners, and wore white gaiters and a long hanging
    eye-glass. His appearance I should never have forgotten anyhow, but he
    is also connected in my mind with my first experience of terror.


    It came to me in the greenroom, the window-seat of which was a favorite
    haunt of mine. Curled up in the deep recess I had been asleep one
    evening, when I was awakened by a strange noise, and, peeping out, saw
    Mr. Harley stretched on the sofa in a fit. One side of his face was
    working convulsively, and he was gibbering and mowing the air with his
    hand. When he saw me, he called out: "Little Nelly! oh, little Nelly!" I
    stood transfixed with horror. He was still dressed as Launcelot Gobbo,
    and this made it all the more terrible. A doctor was sent for, and Mr.
    Harley was looked after, but he never recovered from his seizure and
    died a few days afterwards.


    Although so much of my early life is vague and indistinct, I can always
    see and hear Mr. Harley as I saw and heard him that night, and I can
    always recollect the view from the greenroom window. It looked out on a
    great square courtyard, in which the spare scenery, that was not in
    immediate use, was stacked. For some reason or other this courtyard was
    a favorite playground for a large company of rats. I don't know what the
    attraction was for them, except that they may have liked nibbling the
    paint off the canvas. Out they used to troop in swarms, and I, from my
    perch on the window-seat, would watch and wonder. Once a terrible storm
    came on, and years after, at the Lyceum, the Brocken Scene in "Faust"
    brought back the scene to my mind       the thunder and lightning and the
    creatures crawling on every side, the grayness of the whole thing.


    All "calls" were made from the greenroom in those days, and its
    atmosphere was, I think, better than that of the dressing-room in which
    nowadays actors and actresses spend their time during the waits. The
    greenroom at the Princess's was often visited by distinguished people,
    among them Planché, the archaeologist, who did so much for Charles
    Kean's productions, and Macready. One night, as with my usual
    impetuosity I was rushing back to my room to change my dress, I ran
    right into the white waistcoat of an old gentleman! Looking up with
    alarm, I found that I had nearly knocked over the great Mr. Macready.


    "Oh, I beg your pardon!" I exclaimed in eager tones. I had always
    heard from father that Macready was the greatest actor of all, and this
    was our first meeting. I was utterly abashed, but Mr. Macready, looking
    down with a very kindly smile, only answered: "Never mind! You are a
    very polite little girl, and you act very earnestly and speak very
    nicely."


    I was too much agitated to do anything but continue my headlong course
    to my dressing-room, but even in those short moments the strange
    attractiveness of his face impressed itself on my imagination. I
    remember distinctly his curling hair, his oddly colored eyes full of
    fire, and his beautiful, wavy mouth.


    When I first described this meeting with Macready, a disagreeable person
    wrote to the papers and said that he did not wish to question my
    veracity, but that it was utterly impossible that Macready could ever
    have brought himself to go to the Princess's at this time, because of
    the rivalry between him and Charles Kean. I know that the two actors
    were not on speaking terms, but very likely Macready had come to see my
    father or Mr. Harley or one of the many members of Kean's company who
    had once served under him.


    The period when I was as vain as a little peacock had come to an end
    before this. I think my part in "Pizarro" saw the last of it. I was a
    Worshiper of the Sun, and in a pink feather, pink swathings of muslin,
    and black arms, I was again struck by my own beauty. I grew quite
    attached to the looking-glass which reflected that feather! Then
    suddenly there came a change. I began to see the whole thing. My
    attentive watching of other people began to bear fruit, and the labor
    and perseverance, care and intelligence which had gone to make these
    enormous productions dawned on my young mind. One must see things for
    oneself. Up to this time I had loved acting because it was great fun,
    but I had not loved the grind. After I began to rehearse Prince Arthur
    in "King John," a part in which my sister Kate had already made a great
    success six years earlier, I understood that if I did not work, I could
    not act. And I wanted to work. I used to get up in the middle of the
    night and watch my gestures in the glass. I used to try my voice and
    bring it down and up in the right places. And all vanity fell away from
    me. At the first rehearsals of "King John" I could not do anything
    right. Mrs. Kean stormed at me, slapped me. I broke down and cried, and
    then, with all the mortification and grief in my voice, managed to
    express what Mrs. Kean wanted and what she could not teach me by doing
    it herself.


    "That's right, that's right!" she cried excitedly, "you've got it! Now
    remember what you did with your voice, reproduce it, remember
    everything, and do it!"


    When the rehearsal was over, she gave me a vigorous kiss. "You've done
    very well," she said. "That's what I want. You're a very tired little
    girl. Now run home to bed." I shall never forget the relief of those
    kind words after so much misery, and the little incident often comes
    back to me now when I hear a young actress say, "I can't do it!" If only
    she can cry with vexation, I feel sure that she will then be able to
    make a good attempt at doing it!


    There were oppositions and jealousies in the Keans' camp, as in most
    theaters, but they were never brought to my notice until I played Prince
    Arthur. Then I saw a great deal of Mr. Ryder, who was the Hubert of the
    production, and discovered that there was some soreness between him and
    his manager. Ryder was a very pugnacious man       an admirable actor, and in
    appearance like an old tree that has been struck by lightning, or a greenless, barren rock; and he was very strong in his likes and
    dislikes, and in his manner of expressing them.


    "D'ye suppose he engaged me for my powers as an actor?" he used to say
    of Mr. Kean. "Not a bit of it! He engaged me for my d              d
    archaeological figure!"


    One night during the run of "King John," a notice was put up that no
    curtain calls would be allowed at the end of a scene. At the end of my
    scene with Hubert there was tremendous applause, and when we did not
    appear, the audience began to shout and yell and cheer. I went off to
    the greenroom, but even from there I could still hear the voices:
    "Hubert! Arthur!" Mr. Kean began the next scene, but it was of no use.
    He had to give in and send for us. Meanwhile old Ryder had been striding
    up and down the greenroom in a perfect fury. "Never mind, ducky!" he
    kept on saying to me; and it was really quite unnecessary, for "ducky"
    was just enjoying the noise and thinking it all capital fun. "Never
    mind! When other people are rotting in their graves, ducky, you'll be up
    there!" (with a terrific gesture indicative of the dizzy heights of
    fame). When the message came to the greenroom that we were to take the
    call, he strode across the stage to the entrance, I running after him
    and quite unable to keep up with his long steps.


    In "Macbeth" I was again associated with Ryder, who was the Banquo when
    I was Fleance, and I remember that after we had been dismissed by
    Macbeth: "Good repose the while," we had to go off up a flight of steps.
    I always stayed at the top until the end of the scene, but Mr. Ryder
    used to go down the other side rather heavily, and Mr. Kean, who wanted
    perfect quiet for the dagger speech, had to keep on saying: "Ssh! ssh!"
    all through it.


    "Those carpenters at the side are enough to ruin any acting," he said
    one night when he came off.


    "I'm a heavy man, and I can't help it," said Ryder.


    "Oh, I didn't know it was you," said Mr. Kean       but I think he did! One
    night I was the innocent cause of a far worse disturbance. I dozed at
    the top of the steps and rolled from the top to the bottom with a
    fearful crash! Another night I got into trouble for not catching Mrs.
    Kean when, as Constance, in "King John," she sank down on to the ground.


    "Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it!"


    I was, for my sins, looking at the audience, and Mrs. Kean went down
    with a run, and was naturally very angry with me!


    In 1860 the Keans gave up the management of the Princess's Theater and
    went to America. They traveled in a sailing vessel, and, being delayed
    by a calm, had to drink water caught in the sails, the water supply
    having given out. I believe that although the receipts were wonderful,
    Charles Kean spent much more than he made during his ten years of
    management. Indeed, he confessed as much in a public announcement. The
    Princess's Theater was not very big, and the seats were low-priced. It
    is my opinion, however, that no manager with high artistic aims,
    resolute to carry them out in his own way, can ever make a fortune.


    Of the other members of the company during my three years at the
    Princess's, I remember best Walter Lacy, who was the
    William Terriss of
    the time. He knew Madame Vestris, and had many entertaining stories
    about her. Then there were the Leclercqs, two clever sisters, Carlotta
    and Rose, who did great things later on. Men, women and children alike
    worked hard, and if the language of the actors was more Rabelaisian than
    polite, they were good fellows and heart and soul devoted to their
    profession. Their salaries were smaller and their lives were simpler
    than is the case with actors now.


    Kate and I had been hard at work for some years, but our parents had no
    notion of our resting. We were now to show what our training had done
    for us in "A Drawing-room Entertainment."

          

    II
    ON THE ROAD
    1859-1861


    From July to September every year the leading theaters in London and the
    provincial cities were closed for the summer vacation. This plan is
    still adhered to more or less, but in London, at any rate, some theaters
    keep their doors open all the year round. During these two months most
    actors take their holiday, but when we were with the Keans we were not
    in a position to afford such a luxury. Kate and I were earning good
    salaries for our age,2 but the family at home was increasing in size,
    and my mother was careful not to let us think that there never could be
    any rainy days. I am bound to say that I left questions of thrift, and
    what we could afford and what we couldn't entirely to my parents. I
    received sixpence a week pocket-money, with which I was more than
    content for many years. Poor we may have been at this time, but, owing
    to my mother's diligent care and cleverness, we always looked nice and
    neat. One of the few early dissipations I can remember was a Christmas
    party in Half Moon Street, where our white muslin dresses were equal to
    any present. But more love and toil and pride than money had gone to
    make them. I have a very clear vision of coming home late from the
    theater to our home in Stanhope Street, Regent's Park, and seeing my
    dear mother stitching at those pretty frocks by the light of one candle.
    It was no uncommon thing to find her sewing at that time, but if she was
    tired, she never showed it. She was always bright and tender. With the
    callousness of childhood, I scarcely realized the devotion and ceaseless
    care that she bestowed on us, and her untiring efforts to bring us up as
    beautifully as she could. The knowledge came to me later on when, all
    too early in my life, my own responsibilities came on me and quickened
    my perceptions. But I was a heartless little thing when I danced off to
    that party! I remember that when the great evening came, our hair, which
    we still wore down our backs, was done to perfection, and we really
    looked fit to dance with a king. As things were, I did dance with the
    late Duke of Cambridge! It was the most exciting Christmas Day in my
    life.

          



      
ELLEN TERRY AT SIXTEEN



    Our summer holidays, as I have said, were spent at Ryde. We stayed at
    Rose Cottage (for which I sought in vain when I revisited the place the
    other day), and the change was pleasant, even though we were working
    hard. One of the pieces father gave at the theater to amuse the summer
    visitors was a farce called "To Parents and Guardians." I played the
    fat, naughty boy Waddilove, a part which had been associated with the
    comedian Robson in London, and I remember that I made the
    unsophisticated audience shout with laughter by entering with my hands
    covered with jam! Father was capital as the French usher Tourbillon;
    and the whole thing went splendidly. Looking back, it seems rather
    audacious for such a child to have attempted a grown-up comedian's part,
    but it was excellent practice for that child! It was the success of
    these little summer ventures at Ryde which made my father think of our
    touring in "A Drawing-room Entertainment" when the Keans left the
    Princess's.


    The entertainment consisted of two little plays "Home for the Holidays"
    and "Distant Relations," and they were written, I think, by a
    Mr.
    Courtney. We were engaged to do it first at the
    Royal Colosseum,
    Regent's Park, by Sir Charles Wyndham's father, Mr. Culverwell. Kate and
    I played all the parts in each piece, and we did quick changes at the
    side worthy of Fregoli! The whole thing was quite a success, and after
    playing it at the Colosseum we started on a round of visits.


    In "Home for the Holidays," which came first on our little programme,
    Kate played Letitia Melrose, a young girl of about seventeen, who is
    expecting her young brother "home for the holidays." Letitia, if I
    remember right, was discovered soliloquizing somewhat after this
    fashion: "Dear little Harry! Left all alone in the world, as we are, I
    feel such responsibility about him. Shall I find him changed, I wonder,
    after two years' absence? He has not answered my letters lately. I hope
    he got the cake and toffee I sent him, but I've not heard a word." At
    this point I entered as Harry, but instead of being the innocent little
    schoolboy of Letitia's fond imagination, Harry appears in loud peg-top
    trousers (peg-top trousers were very fashionable in 1860), with a big
    cigar in his mouth, and his hat worn jauntily on one side. His talk is
    all of racing, betting, and fighting. Letty is struck dumb with
    astonishment at first, but the awful change, which two years have
    effected, gradually dawns on her. She implores him to turn from his
    idle, foolish ways. Master Harry sinks on his knees by her side, but
    just as his sister is about to rejoice and kiss him, he looks up in her
    face and bursts into loud laughter. She is much exasperated, and,
    threatening to send some one to him who will talk to him in a very
    different fashion, she leaves the stage. Master Hopeful thereupon dons
    his dressing-gown and smoking cap, and, lying full length upon the sofa,
    begins to have a quiet smoke. He is interrupted by the appearance of a
    most wonderful and grim old woman in blue spectacles       Mrs. Terrorbody.
    This is no other than "Sister Letty," dressed up in order to frighten
    the youth out of his wits. She talks and talks, and, after painting
    vivid pictures of what will become of him unless he alters his "vile
    ways," leaves him, but not before she succeeds in making him shed tears,
    half of fright and half of anger. Later on, Sister Letty, looking from
    the window, sees a grand fight going on between Master Harry and a
    butcher-boy, and then Harry enters with his coat off, his sleeves tucked
    up, explaining in a state of blazing excitement that he "had to fight
    that butcher-boy, because he had struck a little girl in the street."
    Letty sees that the lad has a fine nature in spite of his folly, and
    appeals to his heart and the nobility of his nature       this time not in
    vain.


    "Distant Relations" was far more inconsequent, but it served to show our
    versatility, at any rate. I was all things by turns, and nothing long!
    First I was the page boy who admitted the "relations" (Kate in many
    guises). Then I was a relation myself       Giles, a rustic. As Giles, I
    suddenly asked if the audience would like to hear me play the drum, and
    "obliged" with a drum solo, in which I had spent a great deal of time
    perfecting myself. Long before this I remember dimly some rehearsal when
    I was put in the orchestra and taken care of by "the gentleman who
    played the drum," and how badly I wanted to play it too! I afterwards
    took lessons from Mr. Woodhouse, the drummer at the Princess's. Kate
    gave an imitation of Mrs. Kean as Constance so beautifully that she used
    to bring tears to my eyes, and make the audience weep too.


    Both of us, even at this early age, had dreams of playing all Mrs.
    Kean's parts. We knew the words, not only of them, but of every female
    part in every play in which we had appeared at the Princess's. "Walking
    on is so dull," the young actress says sometimes to me now, and I ask
    her if she knows all the parts of the play in which she is "walking on."
    I hardly ever find that she does. "I have no understudy," is her excuse.
    Even if a young woman has not been given an understudy, she ought, if
    she has any intention of taking her profession as an actress seriously,
    to constitute herself an understudy to every part in the piece! Then she
    would not find her time as a "super" hang heavy on her hands.


    Some of my readers may be able to remember the "Stalactite Caverns"
    which used to form one of the attractions at the Colosseum. It was there
    that I first studied the words of Juliet. To me the gloomy horror of the
    place was a perfect godsend! Here I could cultivate a creepy, eerie
    sensation, and get into a fitting frame of mind for the potion scene.
    Down in this least imposing of subterranean abodes I used to tremble
    and thrill with passion and terror. Ah, if only in after years, when I
    played Juliet at the Lyceum, I could have thrilled an audience to the
    same extent!


    After a few weeks at the Colosseum, we began our little tour. It was a
    very merry, happy time. We traveled a company of five, although only two
    of us were acting. There were my father and mother, Kate and myself, and
    Mr. Sydney Naylor, who played the very important part of orchestra. With
    a few exceptions we made the journeys in a carriage. Once we tramped
    from Bristol to Exeter. Oh, those delightful journeys on the open road!
    I tasted the joys of the strolling player's existence, without its
    miseries. I saw the country for the first time.... When they asked me
    what I was thinking of as we drove along, I remember answering: "Only
    that I should like to run wild in a wood for ever!" At night we stayed
    in beautiful little inns which were ever so much more cheap and
    comfortable than the hotels of to-day. In some of the places we were
    asked out to tea and dinner and very much fêted. An odd little troupe we
    were! Father was what we will call for courtesy's sake "Stage Manager,"
    but in reality he set the stage himself, and did the work which
    generally falls to the lot of the stage manager and an army of
    carpenters combined. My mother used to coach us up in our parts, dress
    us, make us go to sleep part of the day so that we might look "fresh" at
    night, and look after us generally. Mr. Naylor, who was not very much
    more than a boy, though to my childish eyes his years were quite
    venerable, besides discoursing eloquent music in the evenings, during
    the progress of the "Drawing-room Entertainment," would amuse us       me
    most especially       by being very entertaining himself during our journeys
    from place to place. How he made us laugh about       well, mostly about
    nothing at all.


    We traveled in this way for nearly two years, visiting a new place every
    day, and making, I think, about ten to fifteen pounds a performance. Our
    little pieces were very pretty, but very slight, too; and I can only
    suppose that the people thought that "never anything can be amiss when
    simpleness and duty tender it," for they received our entertainment very
    well. The time had come when my little brothers had to be sent to
    school, and our earnings came in useful.


    When the tour came to an end in 1861, I went to London with my father to
    find an engagement, while Kate joined the stock company at
    Bristol. We
    still gave the "Drawing-room Entertainment" at Ryde in the summer, and
    it still drew large audiences.


    In London my name was put on an agent's books in the usual way, and
    presently he sent me to Madame Albina de Rhona, who had not long taken
    over the management of the Royal Soho Theater and changed its name to
    the Royalty. The improvement did not stop at the new play. French
    workmen had swept and garnished the dusty, dingy place and transformed
    it into a theater as dainty and pretty as Madame de Rhona herself.
    Dancing was Madame's strong point, but she had been very successful as
    an actress too, first in Paris and Petersburg, and then in London at the
    St. James's and Drury Lane. What made her go into management on her own
    account I don't know. I suppose she was ambitious, and rich enough for
    the enterprise.


    At this time I was "in standing water," as Malvolio says of Viola when
    she is dressed as a boy. I was neither child nor woman       a long-legged
    girl of about thirteen, still in short skirts, and feeling that I ought
    to have long ones. However, when I set out with father to see Madam de
    Rhona, I was very smart. I borrowed Kate's new bonnet       pink silk trimmed
    with black lace       and thought I looked nice in it. So did father, for he
    said on the way to the theater that pink was my color. In fact, I am
    sure it was the bonnet that made Madame de Rhona engage me on the spot!


    She was the first Frenchwoman I had ever met, and I was tremendously
    interested in her. Her neat and expressive ways made me feel very
    "small," or rather big and clumsy, even at the first interview. A
    quick-tempered, bright, energetic little woman, she nearly frightened me
    out of my wits at the first rehearsal by dancing round me on the stage
    in a perfect frenzy of anger at what she was pleased to call my
    stupidity. Then something I did suddenly pleased her, and she
    overwhelmed me with compliments and praise. After a time these became
    the order of the day, and she soon won my youthful affections. "Gross
    flattery," as a friend of mine says, "is good enough for me!" Madame de
    Rhona was, moreover, very kind-hearted and generous. To her generosity I
    owed the first piece of jewelery I ever possessed       a pretty little
    brooch, which, with characteristic carelessness, I promptly lost!
    Besides being flattered by her praise and grateful for her kindness, I
    was filled with great admiration for her. She was a wee thing       like a
    toy, and her dancing was really exquisite. When I watched the way she
    moved her hands and feet, despair entered my soul. It was all so
    precise, so "express and admirable." Her limbs were so dainty and
    graceful       mine so big and unmanageable! "How long and gaunt I am," I
    used to say to myself, "and what a pattern of prim prettiness she is!" I
    was so much ashamed of my large hands, during this time at the Royalty,
    that I kept them tucked up under my arms! This subjected me to
    unmerciful criticism from Madame Albina at rehearsals.


    "Take down your hands," she would call out. "Mon Dieu! It is like an
    ugly young poulet going to roost!"


    In spite of this, I did not lose my elegant habit for many years! I was
    only broken of it at last by a friend saying that he supposed I had very
    ugly hands, as I never showed them! That did it! Out came the hands to
    prove that they were not so very ugly, after all! Vanity often
    succeeds where remonstrance fails.


    The greenroom at the Royalty was a very pretty little place, and Madame
    Albina sometimes had supper-parties there after the play. One night I
    could not resist the pangs of curiosity, and I peeped through the
    keyhole to see what was going on! I chose a lucky moment! One of
    Madame's admirers was drinking champagne out of her slipper! It was even
    worth the box on the ear that mother gave me when she caught me. She had
    been looking all over the theater for me, to take me home.


    My first part at the Royalty was Clementine in "Attar Gull." Of the
    play, adapted from a story by Eugene Sue, I have a very hazy
    recollection, but I know that I had one very effective scene in it.
    Clementine, an ordinary fair-haired ingenue in white muslin, has a great
    horror of snakes, and, in order to cure her of her disgust, some one
    suggests that a dead snake should be put in her room, and she be taught
    how harmless the thing is for which she had such an aversion. An Indian
    servant, who, for some reason or other, has a deadly hatred for the
    whole family, substitutes a live reptile. Clementine appears at the
    window with the venomous creature coiled round her neck, screaming with
    wild terror. The spectators on the stage think that the snake is dead,
    and that she is only screaming from "nerves," but in reality she is
    being slowly strangled. I began screaming in a frantic, heartrending
    manner, and continued screaming, each cry surpassing the last in
    intensity and agony. At rehearsal I could not get these screams right
    for a long time. Madame de Rhona grew more and more impatient and at
    last flew at me like a wild-cat and shook me. I cried, just as I had
    done when I could not get Prince Arthur's terror right, and then the
    wild, agonized scream that Madame de Rhona wanted came to me. I
    reproduced it and enlarged it in effect. On the first night the
    audience applauded the screaming more than anything in the play. Madame
    de Rhona assured me that I had made a sensation, kissed me and said I
    was a genius! How sweet and pleasant her flattering words sounded in my
    young and inexperienced ears I need hardly say.


    Looking back to it now, I know perfectly well why I, a mere child of
    thirteen, was able to give such a realistic display of horror. I had the
    emotional instinct to start with, no doubt, but if I did it well, it was
    because I was able to imagine what would be real in such a situation.
    I had never observed such horror, but I had previously realized it,
    when, as Arthur, I had imagined the terror of having my eyes put out.


    Imagination! imagination! I put it first years ago, when I was asked
    what qualities I thought necessary for success upon the stage. And I am
    still of the same opinion. Imagination, industry, and intelligence       "the
    three I's"       are all indispensable to the actress, but of these three the
    greatest is, without any doubt, imagination.


    After this "screaming" success, which, however, did not keep "Attar
    Gull" in the bill at the Royalty for more than a few nights, I continued
    to play under Madame de Rhona's management until February 1862. During
    these few months new plays were being constantly put on, for Madame was
    somehow not very fortunate in gauging the taste of the public. It was in
    the fourth production       "The Governor's Wife," that, as Letty Briggs, I
    had my first experience of what is called "stage fright." I had been on
    the stage more than five years, and had played at least sixteen parts,
    so there was really no excuse for me. I suspect now that I had not taken
    enough pains to get word-perfect. I know I had five new parts to study
    between November 21 and December 26.


    Stage fright is like nothing else in the world. You are standing on the
    stage apparently quite well and in your right mind, when suddenly you
    feel as if your tongue had been dislocated and was lying powerless in
    your mouth. Cold shivers begin to creep downwards from the nape of your
    neck and all up you at the same time, until they seem to meet in the
    small of your back. About this time you feel as if a centipede, all of
    whose feet have been carefully iced, has begun to run about in the roots
    of your hair. The next agreeable sensation is the breaking out of a cold
    sweat all over. Then you are certain that some one has cut the muscles
    at the back of your knees. Your mouth begins to open slowly, without
    giving utterance to a single sound, and your eyes seem inclined to jump
    out of your head over the footlights. At this point it is as well to get
    off the stage as quickly as you can, for you are far beyond human help.


    Whether everybody suffers in this way or not I cannot say, but it
    exactly describes the torture I went through in "The Governor's Wife." I
    had just enough strength and sense to drag myself off the stage and
    seize a book, with which, after a few minutes, I reappeared and
    ignominiously read my part. Whether Madame de Rhona boxed my ears or
    not, I can't remember, but I think it is very likely she did, for she
    was very quick-tempered. In later years I have not suffered from the
    fearsome malady, but even now, after fifty years of stage-life, I never
    play a new part without being overcome by a terrible nervousness and a
    torturing dread of forgetting my lines. Every nerve in my body seems to
    be dancing an independent jig on its own account.


    It was at the Royalty that I first acted with Mr. Kendal. He and I
    played together in a comedietta called "A Nice Quiet Day." Soon after,
    my engagement came to an end, and I went to Bristol, where I gained the
    experience of my life with a stock company.

    LIFE IN A STOCK COMPANY
    1862-1863 


    "I think anything, naturally written, ought to be in everybody's way
    that pretends to be an actor." This remark of Colley Cibber's long ago
    struck me as an excellent motto for beginning on the stage. The
    ambitious boy thinks of Hamlet, the ambitious girl of Lady Macbeth or
    Rosalind, but where shall we find the young actor and actress whose
    heart is set on being useful?


    Usefulness! It is not a fascinating word, and the quality is not one
    of which the aspiring spirit can dream o' nights, yet on the stage it is
    the first thing to aim at. Not until we have learned to be useful can we
    afford to do what we like. The tragedian will always be a limited
    tragedian if he has not learned how to laugh. The comedian who cannot
    weep will never touch the highest levels of mirth.


    It was in the stock companies that we learned the great lesson of
    usefulness; we played everything       tragedy, comedy, farce, and burlesque.
    There was no question of parts "suiting" us; we had to take what we were
    given.


    The first time I was cast for a part in a burlesque I told the stage
    manager I couldn't sing and I couldn't dance. His reply was short and to
    the point. "You've got to do it," and so I did it in a way       a very funny
    way at first, no doubt. It was admirable training, for it took all the
    self-consciousness out of me to start with. To end with, I thought it
    capital fun, and enjoyed burlesque as much as Shakespeare.


    What was a stock company? I forget that in these days the question may
    be asked in all good faith, and that it is necessary to answer it. Well,
    then, a stock company was a company of actors and actresses brought
    together by the manager of a provincial theater to support a leading
    actor or actress       "a star"       from London. When Edmund Kean,
    the Kembles,
    Macready, or Mrs. Siddons visited provincial towns, these companies were
    ready to support them in Shakespeare. They were also ready to play
    burlesque, farce, and comedy to fill out the bill. Sometimes the "stars"
    would come for a whole season; if their magnitude were of the first
    order, for only one night. Sometimes they would rehearse with the stock
    company, sometimes they wouldn't. There is a story of a manager visiting
    Edmund Kean at his hotel on his arrival in a small provincial town, and
    asking the great actor when he would rehearse.


    "Rehearse! I'm not going to rehearse       I'm going to sleep!"


    "Have you any instructions?"


    "Instructions! No! Tell 'em to keep at a long arm's length away from me
    and do their d              d worst!"


    At Bristol, where I joined Mr. J.H. Chute's stock company in 1861, we
    had no experience of that kind, perhaps because there was no Kean alive
    to give it to us. And I don't think that our "worst" would have been so
    very bad. Mr. Chute, who had married Macready's half-sister, was a
    splendid manager, and he contrived to gather round him a company which
    was something more than "sound."


    Several of its members distinguished themselves greatly in after years.
    Among these I may mention Miss Marie Wilton (now Lady Bancroft) and
    Miss Madge Robertson (now Mrs. Kendal).


    Lady Bancroft had left the company before I joined it, but Mrs. Kendal
    was there, and so was Miss Henrietta Hodson (afterwards Mrs.
    Labouchere). I was much struck at that time by Mrs. Kendal's singing.
    Her voice was beautiful. As an example of how anything can be twisted to
    make mischief, I may quote here an absurd tarradiddle about Mrs. Kendal
    never forgetting in after years that in the Bristol stock company she
    had to play the singing fairy to my Titania in "A Midsummer Night's
    Dream." The simple fact, of course, was that she had the best voice in
    the company, and was of such infinite value in singing parts that no
    manager in his senses would have taken her out of them. There was no
    question of my taking precedence of her, or of her playing second fiddle
    to me.


    Miss Hodson was a brilliant burlesque actress, a good singer, and a
    capital dancer. She had great personal charm, too, and was an enormous
    favorite with the Bristol public. I cannot exactly call her a "rival" of
    my sister Kate's, for Kate was the "principal lady" or "star," and
    Henrietta Hodson the "soubrette," and, in burlesque, the "principal
    boy." Nevertheless, there were certainly rival factions of admirers, and
    the friendly antagonism between the Hodsonites and the Terryites used to
    amuse us all greatly.


    We were petted, spoiled, and applauded to our heart's content, but I
    don't think it did us any harm. We all had scores of admirers, but their
    youthful ardor seemed to be satisfied by tracking us when we went to
    rehearsal in the morning and waiting for us outside the stage-door at
    night.


    When Kate and I had a "benefit" night, they had an opportunity of coming
    to rather closer quarters, for on these occasions tickets could be
    bought from members of the company, as well as at the box-office of the
    theater.


    Our lodgings in Queen Square were besieged by Bristol youths who were
    anxious to get a glimpse of the Terrys. The Terrys demurely chatted with
    them and sold them tickets. My mother was most vigilant in her rôle of
    duenna, and from the time I first went on the stage until I was a grown
    woman I can never remember going home unaccompanied by either her or my
    father.


    The leading male members of Mr. Chute's stock company were Arthur Wood
    (an admirable comedian), William George Rignold, W.H. Vernon, and
    Charles Coghlan. At this time Charles Coghlan was acting magnificently,
    and dressing each of his characters so correctly and so perfectly that
    most of the audience did not understand it. For instance, as Glavis, in
    "The Lady of Lyons," he looked a picture of the Directoire fop. He did
    not compromise in any single detail, but wore the long straggling hair,
    the high cravat, the eye-glass, bows, jags, and tags, to the infinite
    amusement of some members of the audience, who could not imagine what
    his quaint dress meant. Coghlan's clothes were not more perfect than his
    manner, but both were a little in advance of the appreciation of Bristol
    playgoers in the 'sixties.


    At the Princess's Theater I had gained my experience of long rehearsals.
    When I arrived in Bristol I was to learn the value of short ones. Mr.
    Chute took me in hand, and I had to wake up and be alert with brains
    and body. The first part I played was Cupid in "Endymion." To this day I
    can remember my lines. I entered as a blind old woman in what is known
    in theatrical parlance as a "disguise cloak." Then, throwing it off, I
    said:


  
    
      
        
          
            
              
"Pity the poor blind       what no one here?
Nay then, I'm not so blind as I appear,
And so to throw off all disguise and sham,
Let me at once inform you who I am!
I'm Cupid!"

              
            
          
        
      
    
  


    Henrietta Hodson as Endymion and Kate as Diana had a dance with me which
    used to bring down the house. I wore a short tunic which in those days
    was considered too scanty to be quite nice, and carried the conventional
    bow and quiver.


    In another burlesque, "Perseus and Andromeda," I played Dictys; it was
    in this piece that Arthur Wood used to make people laugh by punning on
    the line: "Such a mystery (Miss Terry) here!" It was an absurd little
    joke, but the people used to cheer and applaud.


    At the end of my first season at Bristol I returned to London for a time
    to play at the Haymarket under Mr. Buckstone, but I had another season
    at Bristol in the following year. While my stage education was
    progressing apace, I was, through the influence of a very wonderful
    family whose acquaintance we made, having my eyes opened to beautiful
    things in art and literature. Mr. Godwin, the architect and
    archaeologist, was living in Bristol when Kate and I were at the Theater
    Royal, and we used to go to his house for some of the Shakespeare
    readings in which our Bristol friends asked us to take part. This house,
    with its Persian rugs, beautiful furniture, its organ, which for the
    first time I learned to love, its sense of design in every detail, was a
    revelation to me, and the talk of its master and mistress made me
    think. At the theater I was living in an atmosphere which was
    developing my powers as an actress and teaching me what work meant, but
    my mind had begun to grasp dimly and almost unconsciously that I must do
    something for myself       something that all the education and training I
    was receiving in my profession could not do for me. I was fourteen years
    old at Bristol, but I now felt that I had never really lived at all
    before. For the first time I began to appreciate beauty, to observe, to
    feel the splendor of things, to aspire!


    I remember that in one of the local papers there had appeared under the
    headline "Jottings" some very wonderful criticisms of the performances
    at the theater. The writer, whoever he was, did not indulge in flattery,
    and in particular he attacked our classical burlesques on the ground
    that they were ugly. They were discussing "Jottings" one day at the
    Godwins' house, and Kate said it was absurd to take a burlesque so
    seriously. "Jottings" was all wrong.


    "I don't know," said our host. "Even a burlesque can be beautiful."


    Afterwards he asked me what I thought of "Jottings," and I confessed
    that there seemed to me a good deal of truth in what had been said. I
    had cut out all that he had written about us, read it several times, and
    thought it all very clever, most amusing       and generally right. Later on
    I found that Mr. Godwin and "Jottings" were one and the same!


    At the Godwins' I met Mr. Barclay, Mr. Hine,
    William Burges the
    architect, and many other people who made an impression on my young
    mind. I accepted their lessons eagerly, and found them of the greatest
    value later on.


    In March 1863 Mr. Chute opened the Theater Royal, Bath, when, besides a
    specially written play symbolic of the event, his stock company
    performed "A Midsummer Night's Dream." Titania was the first Shakespeare
    part I had played since I left Charles Kean, but I think even in those
    early days I was more at home in Shakespeare than anything else. Mr.
    Godwin designed my dress, and we made it at his house in Bristol. He
    showed me how to damp it and "wring" it while it was wet, tying up the
    material as the Orientals do in their "tie and dry" process, so that
    when it was dry and untied, it was all crinkled and clinging. This was
    the first lovely dress that I ever wore, and I learned a great deal from
    it.


    Almost directly after that appearance at Bath I went to London to
    fulfill an engagement at the Haymarket Theater, of which
    Mr. Buckstone
    was still the manager and Sothern the great attraction. I had played
    Gertrude Howard in "The Little Treasure" during the stock season at
    Bristol, and when Mr. Buckstone wanted to do the piece at the Haymarket,
    he was told about me. I was fifteen at this time, and my sense of humor
    was as yet ill-developed. I was fond of "larking" and merry enough, but
    I hated being laughed at! At any rate, I could see no humor in Mr.
    Sothern's jokes at my expense. He played my lover in "The Little
    Treasure," and he was always teasing me       pulling my hair, making me
    forget my part and look like an idiot. But for dear old Mr. Howe, who
    was my "father" in the same piece, I should not have enjoyed acting in
    it at all, but he made amends for everything. We had a scene together in
    which he used to cry, and I used to cry       oh, it was lovely!


    Why I should never have liked Sothern, with his wonderful hands and blue
    eyes, Sothern, whom every one found so fascinating and delightful, I
    cannot say, and I record it as discreditable to me, not to him. It was
    just a case of "I do not like thee, Dr. Fell." I admired him       I could
    not help doing that       but I dreaded his jokes, and thought some of them
    very cruel.


    Another thing I thought cruel at this time was the scandal which was
    talked in the theater. A change for the better has taken place in this
    respect       at any rate, in conduct. People behave better now, and in our
    profession, carried on as it is in the public eye, behavior is
    everything. At the Haymarket there were simply no bounds to what was
    said in the greenroom. One night I remember gathering up my skirts (we
    were, I think, playing "The Rivals" at the time), making a curtsey, as
    Mr. Chippendale, one of the best actors in old comedy I ever knew, had
    taught me, and sweeping out of the room with the famous line from
    another Sheridan play: "Ladies and gentlemen, I leave my character
    behind me!"


    I see now that this was very priggish of me, but I am quite as
    uncompromising in my hatred of scandal now as I was then. Quite recently
    I had a line to say in "Captain Brassbound's Conversion," which is a
    very helpful reply to any tale-bearing. "As if any one ever knew the
    whole truth about anything!" That is just the point. It is only the
    whole truth which is informing and fair in the long run, and the whole
    truth is never known.


    I regard my engagement at the Haymarket as one of my lost opportunities,
    which in after years I would have given much to have over again. I might
    have learned so much more than I did. I was preoccupied by events
    outside the theater. Tom Taylor, who had for some time been a good
    friend to both Kate and me, had introduced us to Mr. Watts, the great
    painter, and to me the stage seemed a poor place when compared with the
    wonderful studio where Kate and I were painted as "The Sisters." At the
    Taylors' house, too, the friends, the arts, the refinements had an
    enormous influence on me, and for a time the theater became almost
    distasteful. Never at any time in my life have I been ambitious, but at
    the Haymarket I was not even passionately anxious to do my best with
    every part that came in my way       a quality which with me has been a good
    substitute for ambition. I was just dreaming of and aspiring after
    another world, a world full of pictures and music and gentle, artistic
    people with quiet voices and elegant manners. The reality of such a
    world was Little Holland House, the home of Mr. Watts.

          

    
    

          

          THE SISTERS       (KATE AND ELLEN TERRY)

    From the painting by George Frederick Watts

    Photograph by the Autotype Company, London

          

    So I confess quite frankly that I did not appreciate until it was too
    late, my advantages in serving at the Haymarket with comrades who were
    the most surpassingly fine actors and actresses in old comedy that I
    have ever known. There were Mr. Buckstone, the
    Chippendales, Mr.
    Compton, Mr. Farren. They one and all thoroughly understood
    Sheridan.
    Their bows, their curtseys, their grand manner, the indefinable style
    which they brought to their task were something to see. We shall never
    know their like again, and the smoothest old-comedy acting of this age
    seems rough in comparison. Of course, we suffer more with every fresh
    decade that separates us from Sheridan. As he gets farther and farther
    away, the traditions of the performances which he conducted become paler
    and paler. Mr. Chippendale knew these traditions backwards. He might
    even have known Sheridan himself. Charles Reade's mother did know him,
    and sat on the stage with him while he rehearsed "The School for
    Scandal" with Mrs. Abingdon, the original Lady Teazle in the part.


    Mrs. Abingdon, according to Charles Reade, who told the story, had just
    delivered the line, "How dare you abuse my relations?" when Sheridan
    stopped the rehearsal.


    "No, no, that won't do at all! It mustn't be pettish. That's
    shallow       shallow. You must go up stage with, 'You are just what my
    cousin Sophy said you would be,' and then turn and sweep down on him
    like a volcano. 'You are a great bear to abuse my relations! How dare
    you abuse my relations!'"


    I want to refrain, in telling the story of my life, from praising the
    past at the expense of the present. It is at best the act of a fogey and
    always an easy thing to do, as there are so few people who can
    contradict one. Yet even the fear of joining hands with the people who
    like every country but their own, and every age except that in which
    they live, shall not deter me from saying that although I have seen
    many improvements in actors and acting since I was at the Haymarket, I
    have never seen artificial comedy acted as it was acted there.


    Not that I was much good at it myself. I played Julia in "The Rivals"
    very ill; it was too difficult and subtle for me       ungrateful into the
    bargain       and I even made a blunder in bringing down the curtain on the
    first night. It fell to my lot to finish the play       in players' language,
    to speak the "tag." Now, it has been a superstition among actors for
    centuries that it is unlucky to speak the "tag" in full at rehearsal. So
    during the rehearsals of "The Rivals," I followed precedent and did not
    say the last two or three words of my part and of the play, but just
    "mum, mum, mum!" When the first night came, instead of dropping my voice
    with the last word in the conventional and proper manner, I ended with
    an upward inflection, which was right for the sense, but wrong for the
    curtain.


    This unexpected innovation produced utter consternation all round me.
    The prompter was so much astounded that he thought there was something
    more coming and did not give the "pull" for the curtain to come down.
    There was a horrid pause while it remained up, and then Mr. Buckstone,
    the Bob Acres of the cast, who was very deaf and had not heard the
    upward inflection, exclaimed loudly and irritably: "Eh! eh! What does
    this mean? Why the devil don't you bring down the curtain?" And he went
    on cursing until it did come down. This experience made me think more
    than ever of the advice of an old actor: "Never leave your stage effects
    to chance, my child, but rehearse, and find out all about it!"


    How I wished I had rehearsed that "tag" and taken the risk of being
    unlucky!


    For the credit of my intelligence I should add that the mistake was a
    technical one, not a stupid one. The line was a question. It demanded
    an upward inflection; but no play can end like that.


    It was not all old comedy at the Haymarket. "Much Ado About Nothing" was
    put on during my engagement, and I played Hero to Miss Louisa Angell's
    Beatrice. Miss Angell was a very modern Beatrice, but I, though I say it
    "as shouldn't," played Hero beautifully! I remember wondering if I
    should ever play Beatrice. I just wondered, that was all. It was the
    same when Miss Angell played Letitia Hardy in "The Belle's Stratagem,"
    and I was Lady Touchwood. I just wondered! I never felt jealous of other
    people having bigger parts; I never looked forward consciously to a day
    when I should have them myself. There was no virtue in it. It was just
    because I wasn't ambitious.


    Louise Keeley, a pretty little woman and clever, took my fancy more than
    any one else in the company. She was always merry and kind, and I
    admired her dainty, vivacious acting. In a burlesque called "Buckstone
    at Home" (in which I played Britannia and came up a trap in a huge
    pearl, which opened and disclosed me) Miss Keeley was delightful. One
    evening the Prince and Princess of Wales (now our King and
    Queen) came
    to see "Buckstone at Home." I believe it was the very first time they
    had appeared at a theater since their marriage. They sat far back in the
    royal box, the ladies and gentlemen of their suite occupying the front
    seats. Miss Keeley, dressed as a youth, had a song in which she brought
    forward by the hand some well-known characters in fairy tales and
    nursery rhymes       Cinderella, Little Boy Blue, Jack and Jill, and so on,
    and introduced them to the audience in a topical verse. One verse ran:


  
    
      
        
          
            
              
"Here's the Prince of Happyland,
Once he dwelt at the Lyceum;
Here's another Prince at hand,
But being invisible, you can't see him!"

              
            
          
        
      
    
  


    Probably the Prince of Wales must have wished the singer at       well, not
    at the Haymarket Theater; but the next minute he must have been touched
    by the loyal greeting that he received. When the audience grasped the
    situation, every one       stalls, boxes, circle, pit, gallery       stood up and
    cheered and cheered again. Never was there a more extraordinary scene in
    a playhouse       such excitement, such enthusiasm! The action of the play
    came to a full stop, but not the cheers. They grew louder and louder,
    until the Prince came forward and bowed his acknowledgments. I doubt if
    any royal personage has ever been so popular in England as he was. Of
    course he is popular as King too, but as Prince of Wales he came nearer
    the people. They had more opportunities of seeing him, and they
    appreciated his untiring efforts to make up by his many public
    appearances for the seclusion in which the Queen lived.


    1864 


    In the middle of the run of "The American Cousin" I left the stage and
    married. Mary Meredith was the part, and I played it vilely. I was not
    quite sixteen years old, too young to be married even in those days,
    when every one married early. But I was delighted, and my parents were
    delighted, although the disparity of age between my husband and me was
    very great. It all seems now like a dream       not a clear dream, but a
    fitful one which in the morning one tries in vain to tell. And even if I
    could tell it, I would not. I was happy, because my face was the type
    which the great artist who had married me loved to paint. I remember
    sitting to him in armor for hours and never realizing that it was heavy
    until I fainted!


    The day of my wedding it was very cold. Like most women, I always
    remember what I was wearing on the important occasions of my life. On
    that day I wore a brown silk gown which had been designed by Holman
    Hunt, and a quilted white bonnet with a sprig of orange-blossom, and I
    was wrapped in a beautiful Indian shawl. I "went away" in a sealskin
    jacket with coral buttons, and a little sealskin cap. I cried a great
    deal, and Mr. Watts said, "Don't cry. It makes your nose swell." The day
    I left home to be married, I "tubbed" all my little brothers and sisters
    and washed their fair hair.

          

    
    


          ELLEN TERRY AT SEVENTEEN
    After her marriage to
    George Frederick Watts
    From a photograph by Julia Margaret Cameron



    Little Holland House, where Mr. Watts lived, seemed to me a paradise,
    where only beautiful things were allowed to come. All the women were
    graceful, and all the men were gifted. The trio of sisters       Mrs. Prinsep       (mother of the painter),
    Lady Somers, and Mrs. Cameron, who was
    the pioneer in artistic photography as we know it to-day       were known as
    Beauty, Dash, and Talent. There were two more beautiful sisters,
    Mrs.
    Jackson and Mrs. Dalrymple. Gladstone,
    Disraeli and Browning were among
    Mr. Watts' visitors. At Freshwater, where I went soon after my marriage,
    I first saw Tennyson.


    As I write down these great names I feel almost guilty of an imposture!
    Such names are bound to raise high anticipations, and my recollections
    of the men to whom some of the names belong are so very humble.


    I sat, shrinking and timid, in a corner       the girl-wife of a famous
    painter. I was, if I was anything at all, more of a curiosity, of a
    side-show, than hostess to these distinguished visitors. Mr. Gladstone
    seemed to me like a suppressed volcano. His face was pale and calm, but
    the calm was the calm of the gray crust of Etna. To look into the
    piercing dark eyes was like having a glimpse into the red-hot crater
    beneath. Years later, when I met him again at the Lyceum and became
    better acquainted with him, this impression of a volcano at rest again
    struck me. Of Disraeli I carried away even a scantier impression. I
    remember that he wore a blue tie, a brighter blue tie than most men
    would dare to wear, and that his straggling curls shook as he walked. He
    looked the great Jew before everything. But "there is the noble Jew," as
    George Meredith writes somewhere, "as well as the bestial Gentile." When
    I first saw Henry Irving made up as Shylock, my thoughts flew back to
    the garden-party at Little Holland House, and Disraeli. I know I must
    have admired him greatly, for the only other time I ever saw him he was
    walking in Piccadilly, and I crossed the road, just to get a good look
    at him. I even went the length of bumping into him on purpose. It was a
    very little bump! My elbow just touched his, and I trembled. He took
    off his hat, muttered, "I beg your pardon," and passed on, not
    recognizing me, of course; but I had had my look into his eyes. They
    were very quiet eyes, and didn't open wide.


    I love Disraeli's novels       like his tie, brighter in color than any one
    else's. It was "Venetia" which first made me see the real Lord Byron,
    the real Lady Byron, too. In "Tancred" I recall a description of a
    family of strolling players which seems to me more like the real thing
    than anything else of the kind in fiction. It is strange that Dizzy's
    novels should be neglected. Can any one with a pictorial sense fail to
    be delighted by their pageantry? Disraeli was a heaven-born artist, who,
    like so many of his race, on the stage, in music, and elsewhere, seems
    to have had an unerring instinct for the things which the Gentile only
    acquires by labor and training. The world he shows us in his novels is
    big and swelling, but only to a hasty judgment is it hollow.


    Tennyson was more to me than a magic-lantern shape, flitting across the
    blank of my young experience, never to return. The first time I saw him
    he was sitting at the table in his library, and Mrs. Tennyson, her very
    slender hands hidden by thick gloves, was standing on a step-ladder
    handing him down some heavy books. She was very frail, and looked like a
    faint tea-rose. After that one time I only remember her lying on a sofa.


    In the evenings I went walking with Tennyson over the fields, and he
    would point out to me the differences in the flight of different birds,
    and tell me to watch their solid phalanxes turning against the sunset,
    the compact wedge suddenly narrowing sharply into a thin line. He taught
    me to recognize the barks of trees and to call wild flowers by their
    names. He picked me the first bit of pimpernel I ever noticed. Always I
    was quite at ease with him. He was so wonderfully simple.


    A hat that I wore at Freshwater suddenly comes to my remembrance. It was
    a brown straw mushroom with a dull red feather round it. It was tied
    under my chin, and I still had my hair down.


    It was easy enough to me to believe that Tennyson was a poet. He showed
    it in everything, although he was entirely free from any assumption of
    the poetical rôle. That Browning, with his carefully brushed hat, smart
    coat, and fine society manners was a poet, always seemed to me far more
    incomprehensible than his poetry, which I think most people would have
    taken straightforwardly and read with a fair amount of ease, if certain
    enthusiasts had not founded societies for making his crooked places
    plain, and (to me) his plain places very crooked. These societies have
    terrorized the ordinary reader into leaving Browning alone. The same
    thing has been tried with Shakespeare, but fortunately the experiment in
    this case has proved less successful. Coroners' inquests by learned
    societies can't make Shakespeare a dead man.


    At the time of my first marriage, when I met these great men, I had
    never had the advantage       I assume that it is an advantage!       of a
    single day's schooling in a real school. What I have learned outside
    my own profession I have learned from my environment. Perhaps it is this
    which makes me think environment more valuable than a set education, and
    a stronger agent in forming character even than heredity. I should have
    written the externals of character, for primal, inner feelings are, I
    suppose, always inherited.


    Still, my want of education may be partly responsible for the
    unsatisfactory blankness of my early impressions. As it takes two to
    make a good talker, so it takes two to make a good hero       in print, at
    any rate. I was meeting distinguished people at every turn, and taking
    no notice of them. At Freshwater I was still so young that I preferred
    playing Indians and Knights of the Round Table with Tennyson's sons,
    Hallam and Lionel, and the young Camerons, to sitting indoors noticing
    what the poet did and said. I was mighty proud when I learned how to
    prepare his daily pipe for him. It was a long churchwarden, and he liked
    the stem to be steeped in a solution of sal volatile, or something of
    that kind, so that it did not stick to his lips. But he and all the
    others seemed to me very old. There were my young knights waiting for
    me; and jumping gates, climbing trees, and running paper-chases are
    pleasant when one is young.


    It was not to inattentive ears that Tennyson read his poems. His reading
    was most impressive, but I think he read Browning's "Ride from Ghent to
    Aix" better than anything of his own, except, perhaps, "The Northern
    Farmer." He used to preserve the monotonous rhythm of the galloping
    horses in Browning's poem, and made the words come out sharply like
    hoofs upon a road. It was a little comic until one got used to it, but
    that fault lay in the ear of the hearer. It was the right way and the
    fine way to read this particular poem, and I have never forgotten it.


    In after years I met Tennyson again, when with Henry Irving I acted in
    two of his plays at the Lyceum. When I come to those plays, I shall have
    more to say of him. Gladstone, too, came into my later life. Browning I
    saw once or twice at dinner-parties, but knew him no better than in this
    early period, when I was Nelly Watts, and heedless of the greatness of
    great men. "To meet an angel and not to be afraid is to be impudent." I
    don't like to confess to it, but I think I must have been, according to
    this definition, very impudent!


    One charming domestic arrangement at Freshwater was the serving of the
    dessert in a separate room from the rest of the dinner. And such a
    dessert it always was!       fruit piled high on great dishes in Veronese
    fashion, not the few nuts and an orange of some English households.


    It must have been some years after the Freshwater days, yet before the
    production of "The Cup," that I saw Tennyson in his carriage outside a
    jeweler's shop in Bond Street.


    "How very nice you look in the daytime," he said. "Not like an actress!"


    I disclaimed my singularity, and said I thought actresses looked very
    nice in the daytime.


    To him and to the others my early romance was always the most
    interesting thing about me. When I saw them in later times, it seemed as
    if months, not years, had passed since I was Nelly Watts.


    Once, at the dictates of a conscience perhaps over fastidious, I made a
    bonfire of my letters. But a few were saved from the burning, more by
    accident than design. Among them I found yesterday a kind little note
    from Sir William Vernon Harcourt, which shows me that I must have known
    him, too, at the time of my first marriage and met him later on when I
    returned to the stage.


  
                   "You cannot tell how much pleased I am to hear that you have been as happy as you deserve to be. The longer one lives, the more one learns not to despair, and to believe that nothing is impossible to those who have courage and hope and youth       I was going to add beauty and genius." (This is the sort of thing that made me blush       and burn my letters before they shamed me!)

                  
"My little boy is still the charm and consolation of my life. He is now twelve years old, and though I say it that should not, is a perfect child, and wins the hearts of all who know him."

  


    That little boy, now in His Majesty's Government, is known as the
    Right
    Honorable Lewis Harcourt. He married an American lady, Miss Burns of New
    York.


    Many inaccurate stories have been told of my brief married life, and I
    have never contradicted them       they were so manifestly absurd. Those who
    can imagine the surroundings into which I, a raw girl, undeveloped in
    all except my training as an actress, was thrown, can imagine the
    situation.


    Of one thing I am certain. While I was with Signor       the name by which
    Mr. Watts was known among his friends       I never had one single pang of
    regret for the theater. This may do me no credit, but it is true.

          

    
    

          

    GEORGE FREDERICK WATTS, R.A.

    From a photograph by Julia Margaret Cameron, made about the time of his
    marriage to Ellen Terry

          

    I wondered at the new life, and worshiped it because of its beauty. When
    it suddenly came to an end, I was thunderstruck; and refused at first to
    consent to the separation, which was arranged for me in much the same
    way as my marriage had been.


    The whole thing was managed by those kind friends whose chief business
    in life seems to be the care of others. I don't blame them. There are
    cases where no one is to blame. "There do exist such things as honest
    misunderstandings," as Charles Reade was always impressing on me at a
    later time. There were no vulgar accusations on either side, and the
    words I read in the deed of separation, "incompatibility of temper"       a
    mere legal phrase       more than covered the ground. Truer still would
    have been "incompatibility of occupation," and the interference of
    well-meaning friends. We all suffer from that sort of thing. Pray God
    one be not a well-meaning friend one's self!


    "The marriage was not a happy one," they will probably say after my
    death, and I forestall them by saying that it in many ways was very
    happy indeed. What bitterness there was effaced itself in a very
    remarkable way.


    I saw Mr. Watts but once face to face after the separation. We met in
    the street at Brighton, and he told me that I had grown! I was never to
    speak to him again. But years later, after I had appeared at the Lyceum
    and had made some success in the world, I was in the garden of a house
    which adjoined Mr. Watt's new Little Holland House, and he, in his
    garden, saw me through the hedge. It was then that I received from him
    the first letter that I had had for years. In this letter he told me
    that he had watched my success with eager interest, and asked me to
    shake hands with him in spirit. "What success I may have," he wrote,
    "will be very incomplete and unsatisfactory if you cannot do what I have
    long been hesitating to ask. If you cannot, keep silence. If you can,
    one word, 'Yes,' will be enough."


    I answered simply, "Yes."


    After that he wrote to me again, and for two or three years we
    corresponded, but I never came into personal contact with him.


    As the past is now to me like a story in a book that I once read, I can
    speak of it easily. But if by doing so I thought that I might give pain
    or embarrassment to any one else, I should be silent about this
    long-forgotten time. After careful consideration it does not seem to me
    that it can be either indiscreet or injurious to let it be known that
    this great artist honored and appreciated my efforts and strife in my
    art; that this great man could not rid himself of the pain of feeling
    that he "had spoiled my life" (a chivalrous assumption of blame for what
    was, I think, a natural, almost inevitable, catastrophe), and that long
    after all personal relation had been broken off, he wrote to me gently,
    kindly,       as sympathetically ignoring the strangeness of the position, as
    if, to use his own expression, "we stood face to face on the brink of an
    universal grave."


    When this tender kindness was established between us, he sent me a
    portrait-head that he had done of me when I was his wife. I think it a
    very beautiful picture. He did not touch it except to mend the edges,
    thinking it better not to try to improve it by the work of another time.


    In one of these letters he writes that "there is nothing in all this
    that the world might not know." Surely the world is always the better
    for having a little truth instead of a great deal of idle inaccuracy and
    falsehood. That is my justification for publishing this, if
    justification be needed.


    If I did not fulfill his too high prophecy that "in addition to your
    artistic eminence, I feel that you will achieve a solid social position,
    make yourself a great woman, and take a noble place in the history of
    your time," I was the better for his having made it.


    If I had been able to look into the future, I should have been less
    rebellious at the termination of my first marriage. Was I so rebellious,
    after all? I am afraid I showed about as much rebellion as a sheep.
    But I was miserable, indignant, unable to understand that there could be
    any justice in what had happened. In a little more than two years I
    returned to the stage. I was practically driven back by those who
    meant to be kind       Tom Taylor, my father and
    mother, and others. They
    looked ahead and saw clearly it was for my good.


    It was a good thing, but at the time I hated it. And I hated going
    back to live at home. Mother furnished a room for me, and I thought the
    furniture hideous. Poor mother!


    For years Beethoven always reminded me of mending stockings, because I
    used to struggle with the large holes in my brothers' stockings upstairs
    in that ugly room, while downstairs Kate played the "Moonlight Sonata."
    I caught up the stitches in time to the notes! This was the period when,
    though every one was kind, I hated my life, hated every one and
    everything in the world more than at any time before or since.

          

    III
    ROSSETTI, BERNHARDT, IRVING
    1865-1867


    Most people know that Tom Taylor was one of the leading playwrights of
    the 'sixties as well as the dramatic critic of The Times, editor of
    Punch, and a distinguished Civil Servant, but to us he was more than
    this       he was an institution! I simply cannot remember when I did not
    know him. It is the Tom Taylors of the world who give children on the
    stage their splendid education. We never had any education in the strict
    sense of the word, yet, through the Taylors and others, we were
    educated. Their house in Lavender Sweep was lovely. I can hardly bear to
    go near that part of London now, it is so horribly changed. Where are
    its green fields and its chestnut-trees? We were always welcome at the Taylors', and every Sunday we heard music and met interesting
    people       Charles Reade among them.
    Mrs. Taylor had rather a hard
    outside       she was like Mrs. Charles Kean in that respect       and I was often
    frightened out of my life by her; yet I adored her. She was in reality
    the most tender-hearted, sympathetic woman, and what an admirable
    musician! She composed nearly all the music for her husband's plays.
    Every Sunday there was music at Lavender Sweep       quartet playing with
    Madame Schumann at the piano.


    Tom Taylor was one of the most benign and gentle of men, a good and a
    loyal friend. At first he was more interested in my sister Kate's career
    than in mine, as was only natural; for, up to the time of my first
    marriage, Kate had a present, I only a future. Before we went to Bristol
    and played with the stock company, she had made her name. At the
    St.
    James's Theater, in 1862, she was playing a small part in a version of Sardou's "Nos Intimes," known then as "Friends and Foes," and in a later
    day and in another version as "Peril."


    Miss Herbert       the beautiful Miss Herbert, as she was appropriately
    called       had the chief part in the play (Mrs. Union), and Kate, although
    not the understudy, was called upon to play it at a few hours' notice.
    She had from childhood acquired a habit of studying every part in every
    play in which she was concerned, so she was as ready as though she had
    been the understudy. Miss Herbert was not a remarkable actress, but her
    appearance was wonderful indeed. She was very tall, with pale gold hair
    and the spiritual, ethereal look which the aesthetic movement loved.
    When mother wanted to flatter me very highly, she said that I looked
    like Miss Herbert! Rossetti founded many of his pictures on her, and she
    and Mrs. "Janie" Morris were his favorite types. When any one was the
    object of Rossetti's devotion, there was no extravagant length to which
    he would not go in demonstrating it. He bought a white bull because it
    had "eyes like Janie Morris," and tethered it on the lawn of his home in
    Chelsea. Soon there was no lawn left       only the bull! He invited people
    to meet it, and heaped favors on it until it kicked everything to
    pieces, when he reluctantly got rid of it.


    His next purchase was a white peacock, which, very soon after its
    arrival, disappeared under the sofa. In vain did Rossetti "shoo" it out.
    It refused to budge. This went on for days.


    "The lovely creature won't respond to me," said Rossetti pathetically to
    a friend.


    The friend dragged out the bird.


    "No wonder! It's dead!"


    "Bulls don't like me," said Rossetti a few days later, "and peacocks
    aren't homely."


    It preyed on his mind so much that he tried to repair the failure by
    buying some white dormice. He sat them up on tiny bamboo chairs, and
    they looked sweet. When the winter was over, he invited a party to meet
    them and congratulate them upon waking up from their long sleep.


    "They are awake now," he said, "but how quiet they are! How full of
    repose!"


    One of the guests went to inspect the dormice more closely, and a
    peculiar expression came over his face. It might almost have been
    thought that he was holding his nose.


    "Wake up, little dormice," said Rossetti, prodding them gently with a
    quill pen.


    "They'll never do that," said the guest. "They're dead. I believe
    they have been dead some days!"


    Do you think Rossetti gave up live stock after this? Not a bit of it. He
    tried armadillos and tortoises.


    "How are the tortoises?" he asked his man one day, after a long spell of
    forgetfulness that he had any.


    "Pretty well, sir, thank you.... That's to say, sir, there ain't no
    tortoises!"


    The tortoises, bought to eat the beetles, had been eaten themselves. At
    least, the shells were found full of beetles.


    And the armadillos? "The air of Chelsea don't suit them," said
    Rossetti's servant. They had certainly left Rossetti's house, but they
    had not left Chelsea. All the neighbors had dozens of them! They had
    burrowed, and came up smiling in houses where they were far from
    welcome.


    This by the way. Miss Herbert, who looked like the Blessed Damosel
    leaning out "across the bar of heaven," was not very well suited to the
    line of parts that she was playing at the St. James's, but she was very
    much admired. During the run of "Friends and Foes" she fell ill. Her
    illness was Kate's opportunity. From the night that Kate played Mrs.
    Union, her reputation was made.


    It was a splendid chance, no doubt, but of what use would it have been
    to any one who was not ready to use it? Kate, though only about nineteen
    at this time, was a finished actress. She had been a perfect Ariel, a
    beautiful Cordelia, and had played at least forty other parts of
    importance since she had appeared as a tiny Robin in the Keans'
    production of "The Merry Wives of Windsor." She had not had her head
    turned by big salaries, and she had never ceased working since she was
    four years old. No wonder that she was capable of bearing the burden of
    a piece at a moment's notice. The Americans cleverly say that "the lucky
    cat watches." I should add that the lucky cat works. Reputations
    on the stage       at any rate, enduring reputations       are not made by chance,
    and to an actress who has not worked hard the finest opportunity in the
    world will be utterly useless.


    My own opinion of my sister's acting must be taken for what it is
    worth       and that is very little. I remember how she looked on the
    stage       like a frail white azalea       and that her acting, unlike that of
    Adelaide Neilson, who was the great popular favorite before Kate came to
    the front, was scientific. She knew what she was about. There was more
    ideality than passionate womanliness in her interpretations. For this
    reason, perhaps, her Cordelia was finer than her Portia or her
    Beatrice.


    She was engaged at one time to a young actor, called Montagu. If the
    course of that love had run smooth, where should I have been? Kate would
    have been the Terry of the age. But Mr. Montagu went to America, and,
    after five years of life as a matinée idol, died there. Before that,
    Arthur Lewis had come along. I was glad because he was rich, and during
    his courtship I had some riding, of which in my girlhood I was
    passionately fond.


    Tom Taylor had an enormous admiration for Kate, and during her second
    season as a "star" at Bristol he came down to see her play Juliet and
    Beatrice and Portia. This second Bristol season came in the middle of my
    time at the Haymarket, but I went back, too, and played Nerissa and
    Hero. Before that I had played my first leading Shakespeare part, but
    only at one matinée.


    An actor named Walter Montgomery was giving a matinée of "Othello" at
    the Princess's (the theater where I made my first appearance) in the
    June of 1863, and he wanted a Desdemona. The agents sent for me. It was
    Saturday, and I had to play it on Monday! But for my training, how could
    I have done it? At this time I knew the words and had studied the
    words       a very different thing       of every woman's part in Shakespeare. I
    don't know what kind of performance I gave on that memorable afternoon,
    but I think it was not so bad. And Walter Montgomery's Othello? Why
    can't I remember something about it? I only remember that the
    unfortunate actor shot himself on his wedding-day!


    Any one who has come with me so far in my life will realize that Kate
    Terry was much better known than Ellen at the time of Ellen's first
    retirement from the stage. From Bristol my sister had gone to London to
    become Fechter's "leading lady," and from that time until she made her
    last appearance in 1867 as Juliet at the Adelphi, her career was a blaze
    of triumph.


    Before I came back to take part in her farewell tour (she became engaged
    to Mr. Arthur Lewis in 1866), I paid my first visit to
    Paris. I saw the
    Empress Eugénie driving in the Bois, looking like an exquisite waxwork.
    Oh, the beautiful slope of women at this period! They sat like lovely
    half-moons, lying back in their carriages. It was an age of elegance       in
    France particularly       an age of luxury. They had just laid down asphalt
    for the first time in the streets of Paris, and the quiet of the
    boulevards was wonderful after the rattling London streets. I often went
    to three parties a night; but I was in a difficult position, as I could
    not speak a word of the language. I met Tissot and Gambard, who had just
    built Rosa Bonheur's house at Nice.


    I liked the Frenchmen because they liked me, but I didn't admire them.


    I tried to learn to smoke, but I never took kindly to it and soon gave
    it up.


    What was the thing that made me homesick for London? Household Words.
    The excitement in the 'sixties over each new Dickens can be understood
    only by people who experienced it at the time. Boys used to sell
    Household Words in the streets, and they were often pursued by an
    eager crowd, for all the world as if they were carrying news of the
    "latest winner."


    Of course I went to the theater in Paris. I saw Sarah Bernhardt for the
    first time, and Madame Favart, Croisette,
    Delaunay, and Got. I never
    thought Croisette       a superb animal       a "patch" on Sarah, who was at this
    time as thin as a harrow. Even then I recognized that Sarah was not a
    bit conventional, and would not stay long at the Comédie. Yet she did
    not put me out of conceit with the old school. I saw "Les Précieuses
    Ridicules" finely done, and I said to myself then, as I have often said
    since: "Old school       new school? What does it matter which, so long as it
    is good enough?"


    Madame Favart I knew personally, and she gave me many useful hints. One
    was never to black my eyes underneath when "making up." She pointed
    out that although this was necessary when the stage was lighted entirely
    from beneath, it had become ugly and meaningless since the introduction
    of top lights.


    The friend who took me everywhere in Paris landed me one night in the
    dressing-room of a singer. I remember it because I heard her complain to
    a man of some injustice. She had not got some engagement that she had
    expected.


    "It serves you damn right!" he answered. "You can't sing a bit." For the
    first time I seemed to realize how brutal it was of a man to speak to a
    woman like that, and I hated it.


    Long afterwards, in the same city, I saw a man sitting calmly in a
    fiacre, a man of the "gentlemanly" class, and ordering the cocher to
    drive on, although a woman was clinging to the side of the carriage and
    refusing to let go. She was a strong, splendid creature of the peasant
    type, bareheaded, with a fine open brow, and she was obviously consumed
    by resentment of some injustice       mad with it. She was dragged along in
    one of the busiest streets in Paris, the little Frenchman sitting there
    smiling, easy. How she escaped death I don't know. Then he became
    conscious that people were looking, and he stopped the cab and let her
    get in. Oh, men!


    Paris! Paris! Young as I was, I fell under the spell, of your elegance,
    your cleanness, your well-designed streets, your nonchalant gaiety. I
    drank coffee at Tortoni's. I visited the studio of Meissonier. I stood
    in the crowd that collected round Rosa Bonheur's "Horse Fair," which was
    in the Salon that year. I grew dead sick of the endless galleries of the
    Louvre. I went to the Madeleine at Easter time, all purple and white
    lilies, and fainted from trying to imagine ecstasy when the Host was
    raised.... I never fainted again in my life, except once from anger,
    when I heard some friends whom I loved slandering another friend whom I
    loved more.


    Good-bye to Paris and back to London, where I began acting again with
    only half my heart. I did very well, they said, as Helen in "The
    Hunchback," the first part I played after my return; but I cared nothing
    about my success. I was feeling wretchedly ill, and angry too, because
    they insisted on putting my married name on the bills.

          

    
    

          

    ELLEN TERRY AS HELEN IN       THE HUNCHBACK      

          

    After playing with Kate at Bristol and at the Adelphi in London, I
    accepted an engagement to appear in a new play by Tom Taylor, called
    "The Antipodes." It was a bad play, and I had a bad part, but
    Telbin's
    scenery was lovely. Telbin was a poet, and he has handed on much of his
    talent to his son, who is alive now, and painted most of our
    Faust
    scenery at the Lyceum       he and dear Mr. Hawes Craven, who so loved his
    garden and could paint the flicker of golden sunshine for the stage
    better than any one. I have always been friendly with the
    scene-painters, perhaps because I have always taken pains about my
    dresses, and consulted them beforehand about the color, so that I should
    not look wrong in their scenes, nor their scenes wrong with my dresses.


    Telbin and Albert Moore together did up the
    New Queen's Theater, Long
    Acre, which was opened in October, 1867, under the ostensible management
    of the Alfred Wigans. I say "ostensible," because Mr. Labouchere had
    something to do with it, and Miss Henrietta Hodson, whom he afterwards
    married, played in the burlesques and farces without which no theater
    bill in London at that time was complete. The Wigans offered me an
    engagement, and I stayed with them until 1868, when I again left the
    stage. During this engagement I acted with Charles Wyndham and
    Lionel Brough, and, last but not least, with
    Henry Irving.


    Mrs. Wigan, née Leonora Pincott, did me the honor to think that I was
    worth teaching, and took nearly as much pains to improve me as Mrs. Kean
    had done at a different stage in my artistic growth. Her own
    accomplishments as a comedy actress impressed me more than I can say. I
    remember seeing her as Mrs. Candour, and thinking to myself, "This is
    absolutely perfect." If I were a teacher I would impress on young
    actresses never to move a finger or turn the eye without being quite
    certain that the movement or the glance tells something. Mrs. Wigan
    made few gestures, but each one quietly, delicately indicated what the
    words which followed expressed. And while she was speaking she never
    frittered away the effect of that silent eloquence.


    One of my besetting sins was       nay, still is       the lack of repose. Mrs.
    Wigan at once detected the fault, and at rehearsals would work to make
    me remedy it. "Stand still!" she would shout from the stalls. "Now
    you're of value!" "Motionless! Just as you are! That's right."


    A few years later she came to see me at the Court Theater, where I was
    playing in "The House of Darnley," and afterwards wrote me the following
    very kind and encouraging letter:

                             December 7, 1877.
    
                      
    "Dear Miss Terry,       
    
                      
    "You have a very difficult part in 'The House of Darnley.' I know       no one who could play it as well as you did last night       but you could do it much better. You would vex me much if I thought you had no ambition in your art. You are the one young actress of my day who can have her success entirely in her own hands. You have all the gifts for your noble profession, and, as you know, your own devotion to it will give you all that can be learned. I'm very glad my stage direction was useful and pleasant to you, and any benefit you have derived from it is overpaid by your style of acting. You cannot have a 'groove'; you are too much of an artist. Go on and prosper, and if at any time you think I can help you in your art, you may always count on that help from your most sincere well-wisher
    
                      
    "LEONORA WIGAN."


    Another service that Mrs. Wigan did me was to cure me of "fooling" on
    the stage. "Did she?" I thought I heard some one interrupt me unkindly
    at that point! Well, at any rate, she gave me a good fright one night,
    and I never forgot it, though I will not say I never laughed again. I
    think it was in "The Double Marriage," the first play put on at the New
    Queen's. As Rose de Beaurepaire, I wore a white muslin Directoire dress
    and looked absurdly young. There was one "curtain" which used to
    convulse Wyndham. He had a line, "Whose child is this?" and there was I,
    looking a mere child myself, and with a bad cold in my head too,
    answering: "It's bine!" The very thought of it used to send us off
    into fits of laughter. We hung on to chairs, helpless, limp, and
    incapable. Mrs. Wigan said if we did it again, she would go in front and
    hiss us, and she carried out her threat. The very next time we laughed,
    a loud hiss rose from the stagebox. I was simply paralyzed with terror.


    Dear old Mrs. Wigan! The stories that have been told about her would
    fill a book! She was exceedingly plain, rather like a toad, yet,
    perversely, she was more vain of her looks than of her acting. In the
    theater she gave herself great airs and graces, and outside it hobnobbed
    with duchesses and princesses.


    This fondness for aristocratic society gave additional point to the
    story that one day a blear-eyed old cabman in capes and muffler
    descended from the box of a disreputable-looking growler, and inquired
    at the stage-door for Leonora Pincott.


    "Any lady 'ere of that name?"


    "No."


    "Well, I think she's married, and changed her name, but she's 'ere right
    enough. Tell 'er I won't keep 'er a minute. I'm 'er       old father!"


    In "Still Waters Run Deep" I was rather good as Mrs. Mildmay, and the
    rest of the cast were admirable. Mrs. Wigan was, of course, Mrs.
    Sternhold. Wyndham, who was afterwards to be such a splendid Mildmay,
    played Hawksley, and Alfred Wigan was Mildmay, as he had been in the
    original production. When the play is revived now, much of it seems very
    old-fashioned, but the office scene strikes one as freshly and strongly
    as when it was first acted. I don't think that any drama which is vital
    and essential can ever be old-fashioned.

    MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF HENRY IRVING 


    One very foggy night in December 1867       it was Boxing Day, I think       I
    acted for the first time with Henry Irving. This ought to have been a
    great event in my life, but at the time it passed me by and left "no
    wrack behind." Ever anxious to improve on the truth, which is often
    devoid of all sensationalism, people have told a story of Henry Irving
    promising that if he ever were in a position to offer me an engagement I
    should be his leading lady. But this fairy story has been improved on
    since. The newest tale of my first meeting with Henry Irving was told
    during my jubilee. Then, to my amazement, I read that on that famous
    night when I was playing Puck at the Princess's, and caught my toe in
    the trap, "a young man with dark hair and a white face rushed forward
    from the crowd and said: 'Never mind, darling. Don't cry! One day you
    will be queen of the stage.' It was Henry Irving!"

    In view of these legends, I ought to say all the more stoutly that,
    until I went to the Lyceum Theater, Henry Irving was nothing to me and I
    was nothing to him. I never consciously thought that he would become a
    great actor. He had no high opinion of my acting! He has said since
    that he thought me at the Queen's Theater charming and individual as a
    woman, but as an actress hoydenish! I believe that he hardly spared me
    even so much definite thought as this. His soul was not more surely in
    his body than in the theater, and I, a woman who was at this time caring
    more about love and life than the theater, must have been to him more or
    less unsympathetic. He thought of nothing else, cared for nothing else;
    worked day and night; went without his dinner to buy a book that might
    be helpful in studying, or a stage jewel that might be helpful to wear.
    I remember his telling me that he once bought a sword with a jeweled
    hilt, and hung it at the foot of his bed. All night he kept getting up
    and striking matches to see it, shifting its position, rapt in
    admiration of it.


    He had it all in him when we acted together that foggy night, but he
    could express very little. Many of his defects sprang from his not
    having been on the stage as a child. He was stiff with
    self-consciousness; his eyes were dull and his face heavy. The piece we
    played was Garrick's boiled-down version of "The Taming of the Shrew,"
    and he, as Petruchio, appreciated the humor and everything else far more
    than I did, as Katherine; yet he played badly, nearly as badly as I did;
    and how much more to blame I was, for I was at this time much more easy
    and skillful from a purely technical point of view.


    Was Henry Irving impressive in those days? Yes and no. His fierce and
    indomitable will showed itself in his application to his work. Quite
    unconsciously I learned from watching him that to do work well, the
    artist must spend his life in incessant labor, and deny himself
    everything for that purpose. It is a lesson we actors and actresses
    cannot learn too early, for the bright and glorious heyday of our
    success must always be brief at best.


    Henry Irving, when he played Petruchio, had been toiling in the
    provinces for eleven solid years, and not until Rawdon Scudamore in
    "Hunted Down" had he had any success. Even that was forgotten in his
    failure as Petruchio. What a trouncing he received from the critics who
    have since heaped praise on many worse men!


    I think this was the peculiar quality in his acting afterwards       a kind
    of fine temper, like the purest steel, produced by the perpetual fight
    against difficulties. Socrates, it is said, had every capacity for evil
    in his face, yet he was good as a naturally good man could never be.
    Henry Irving at first had everything against him as an actor. He could
    not speak, he could not walk, he could not look. He wanted to do
    things in a part, and he could not do them. His amazing power was
    imprisoned, and only after long and weary years did he succeed in
    setting it free.


    A man with a will like that must be impressive! To quick-seeing eyes
    he must, no doubt. But my eyes were not quick, and they were, moreover,
    fixed on a world outside the theater. Better than his talent and his
    will I remember his courtesy. In those days, instead of having our
    salaries brought to our dressing-rooms, we used to wait in a queue on
    Treasury Day to receive them. I was always late in coming, and always in
    a hurry to get away. Very gravely and quietly Henry Irving used to give
    up his place to me.


    I played once more at the Queen's after Katherine and Petruchio. It was
    in a little piece called "The Household Fairy," and I remember it
    chiefly through an accident which befell poor Jack Clayton through me.
    The curtain had fallen on "The Household Fairy," and Clayton, who had
    acted with me in it, was dancing with me on the stage to the music which
    was being played during the wait, instead of changing his dress for the
    next piece. This dancing during the entr'acte was very popular among us.
    Many a burlesque quadrille I had with Terriss and others in later days.
    On this occasion Clayton suddenly found he was late in changing, and,
    rushing upstairs to his dressing-room in a hurry, he missed his footing
    and fell back on his head. This made me very miserable, as I could not
    help feeling that I was responsible. Soon afterwards I left the stage
    for six years, without the slightest idea of ever going back. I left it
    without regret. And I was very happy, leading a quiet, domestic life in
    the heart of the country. When my two children were born, I thought of
    the stage less than ever. They absorbed all my time, all my interest,
    all my love.


    IV
    A SIX-YEAR VACATION
    1868-1874


    My disappearance from the stage must have been a heavy blow to my father
    and mother, who had urged me to return in 1866 and were quite certain
    that I had a great future. For the first time for years they had no
    child in the theater. Marion and Floss, who were afterward to adopt the
    stage as a profession, were still at school; Kate had married; and none
    of their sons had shown any great aptitude for acting. Fred, who was
    afterwards to do so well, was at this time hardly out of petticoats.


    Perhaps it was because I knew they would oppose me that I left the stage
    quite quietly and secretly. It seemed to outsiders natural, if
    regrettable, that I should follow Kate's example. But I was troubling
    myself little about what people were thinking and saying. "They are
    saying       what are they saying? Let them be saying!"


    Then a dreadful thing happened. A body was found in the river,       the dead
    body of a young woman very fair and slight and tall. Every one thought
    that it was my body.


    I had gone away without a word. No one knew where I was. My own father
    identified the corpse, and Floss and Marion, at their boarding-school,
    were put into mourning. Then mother went. She kept her head under the
    shock of the likeness, and bethought her of "a strawberry mark upon my
    left arm." (Really I had one over my left knee.) That settled it, for
    there was no such mark to be found upon the poor corpse. It was just at
    this moment that the news came to me in my country retreat that I had
    been found dead, and I flew up to London to give ocular proof to my poor
    distracted parents that I was alive. Mother, who had been the only one
    not to identify the drowned girl, confessed to me that she was so like
    me that just for a second she, too, was deceived. You see, they knew I
    had not been very happy since my return to the stage, and when I went
    away without a word, they were terribly anxious, and prepared to believe
    the first bad tidings that came to hand. It came in the shape of that
    most extraordinary likeness between me and that poor soul who threw
    herself into the river.


    I was not twenty-one when I left the stage for the second time, and I
    haven't made up my mind yet whether it was good or bad for me, as an
    actress, to cease from practicing my craft for six years. Talma, the
    great French actor, recommends long spells of rest, and says that
    "perpetual indulgence in the excitement of impersonation dulls the
    sympathy and impairs the imaginative faculty of the comedian." This is
    very useful in my defense, yet I could find many examples which prove
    the contrary. I could never imagine Henry Irving leaving the stage for
    six months, let alone six years, and I don't think it would have been of
    the slightest benefit to him. But he had not been on the stage as a
    child.


    If I was able to rest so long without rusting, it was, I am sure,
    because I had been thoroughly trained in the technique of acting long
    before I reached my twentieth year       an age at which most students are
    just beginning to wrestle with elementary principles.


    Of course, I did not argue in this way at the time! As I have said, I
    had no intention of ever acting again when I left the Queen's Theater.
    If it is the mark of the artist to love art before everything, to
    renounce everything for its sake, to think all the sweet human things of
    life well lost if only he may attain something, do some good, great
    work       then I was never an artist. I have been happiest in my work when I
    was working for some one else. I admire those impersonal people who care
    for nothing outside their own ambition, yet I detest them at the same
    time, and I have the simplest faith that absolute devotion to another
    human being means the greatest happiness. That happiness was now mine.


    I led a most unconventional life, and experienced exquisite delight from
    the mere fact of being in the country. No one knows what "the country"
    means until he or she has lived in it. "Then, if ever, come perfect
    days."


    What a sensation it was, too, to be untrammeled by time! Actors must
    take care of themselves and their voices, husband their strength for the
    evening work, and when it is over they are too tired to do anything! For
    the first time I was able to put all my energies into living. Charles
    Lamb says, I think, that when he left the East India House, he felt
    embarrassed by the vast estates of time at his disposal, and wished that
    he had a bailiff to manage them for him, but I knew no such
    embarrassment.


    I began gardening, "the purest of human pleasures"; I learned to cook,
    and in time cooked very well, though my first essay in that difficult
    art was rewarded with dire and complete failure.


    It was a chicken! Now, as all the chickens had names       Sultan, Duke, Lord
    Tom Noddy, Lady Teazle, and so forth       and as I was very proud of them as
    living birds, it was a great wrench to kill one at all, to start with.
    It was the murder of Sultan, not the killing of a chicken. However, at
    last it was done, and Sultan deprived of his feathers, floured, and
    trussed. I had no idea how this was all done, but I tried to make him
    "sit up" nicely like the chickens in the shops.


    He came up to the table looking magnificent       almost turkey-like in his
    proportions.


    "Hasn't this chicken rather an odd smell?" said our visitor.


    "How can you!" I answered. "It must be quite fresh       it's Sultan!"


    However, when we began to carve, the smell grew more and more potent.


    I had cooked Sultan without taking out his in'ards!


    There was no dinner that day except bread-sauce, beautifully made,
    well-cooked vegetables, and pastry like the foam of the sea. I had a
    wonderful hand for pastry!


    My hour of rising at this pleasant place near Mackery End in
    Hertfordshire was six. Then I washed the babies. I had a perfect mania
    for washing everything and everybody. We had one little servant, and I
    insisted on washing her head. Her mother came up from the village to
    protest.


    "Never washed her head in my life. Never washed any of my children's
    heads. And just look at their splendid hair!"


    After the washing I fed the animals. There were two hundred ducks and
    fowls to feed, as well as the children. By the time I had done this, and
    cooked the dinner, the morning had flown away. After the midday meal I
    sewed. Sometimes I drove out in the pony-cart. And in the evening I
    walked across the common to fetch the milk. The babies used to roam
    where they liked on this common in charge of a bulldog, while I sat and
    read.


    I studied cookery-books instead of parts       Mrs. Beeton instead of
    Shakespeare!


    Of course, I thought my children the most brilliant and beautiful
    children in the world, and, indeed, "this side idolatry," they were
    exceptional, and they had an exceptional bringing up. They were allowed
    no rubbishy picture-books, but from the first Japanese prints and fans
    lined their nursery walls, and Walter Crane was their classic. If
    injudicious friends gave the wrong sort of present, it was promptly
    burned. A mechanical mouse in which Edy, my little daughter, showed keen
    interest and delight, was taken away as being "realistic and common."
    Only wooden toys were allowed. This severe training proved so effective
    that when a doll dressed in a violent pink silk dress was given to Edy,
    she said it was "vulgar"!


    By that time she had found a tongue, but until she was two years old she
    never spoke a word, though she seemed to notice everything with her
    grave dark eyes. We were out driving when I heard her voice for the
    first time:


    "There's some more."


    She spoke quite distinctly. It was almost uncanny.


    "More what?" I asked in a trembling voice, afraid that having delivered
    herself once, she might lapse into dumbness.


    "Birds!"


    The nursemaid, Essie, described Edy tersely as "a piece," while Teddy,
    who was adored by every one because he was fat and fair and
    angelic-looking, she called "the feather of England."


    "The feather of England" was considered by his sister a great coward.
    She used to hit him on the head with a wooden spoon for crying, and
    exhort him, when he said, "Master Teddy afraid of the dark," to be a
    woman!


    I feel that if I go maundering on much longer about my children, some
    one will exclaim with a witty and delightful author when he saw "Peter
    Pan" for the seventh time: "Oh, for an hour of Herod!" When I think of
    little Edy bringing me in minute branches of flowers all the morning,
    with the reassuring intelligence that "there are lots more," I could
    cry. But why should any one be interested in that? Is it interesting to
    any one else that when she dug up a turnip in the garden for the first
    time, she should have come running in to beg me to come quick: "Miss Edy
    found a radish. It's as big as       as big as God!"


    When I took her to her first theater       it was Sanger's Circus       and the
    clown pretended to fall from the tightrope, and the drum went bang! she
    said: "Take me away! take me away! you ought never to have brought me
    here!" No wonder she was considered a dour child! I immediately and
    humbly obeyed.


    It was truly the simple life we led in Hertfordshire. From scrubbing
    floors and lighting fires, cooking, gardening, and harnessing the pony,
    I grew thinner than ever       as thin as a whipping-post, a hurdle, or a
    haddock! I went to church in blue-and-white cotton, with my servant in
    silk. "I don't half like it," she said. "They'll take you for the cook,
    and me for the lady!"


    We kept a goat, a dear fellow whom I liked very much until I caught him
    one day chasing my daughter. I seized him by his horns to inflict severe
    punishment; but then I saw that his eyes were exactly like mine, and it
    made me laugh so much that I let him go and never punished him at all.


    "Boo" became an institution in these days. She was the wife of a doctor
    who kept a private asylum in the neighboring village, and on his death
    she tried to look after the lunatics herself. But she wasn't at all
    successful! They kept escaping, and people didn't like it. This was my
    gain, for "Boo" came to look after me instead, and for the next thirty
    years I was her only lunatic, and she my most constant companion and
    dear and loyal friend.


    We seldom went to London. When we did, Ted nearly had a fit at seeing so
    many "we'els go wound." But we went to Normandy, and saw Lisieux,
    Mantes, Bayeux. Long afterwards, when I was feeling as hard as sandpaper
    on the stage, I had only to recall some of the divine music I had heard
    in those great churches abroad to become soft, melted, able to act. I
    remember in some cathedral we left little Edy sitting down below while
    we climbed up into the clerestory to look at some beautiful piece of
    architecture. The choir were practicing, and suddenly there rose a boy's
    voice, pure, effortless, and clear.... For years that moment stayed with
    me. When we came down to fetch Edy, she said:


    "Ssh! ssh! Miss Edy has seen the angels!"


    Oh, blissful quiet days! How soon they came to an end! Already the
    shadow of financial trouble fell across my peace. Yet still I never
    thought of returning to the stage.


    One day I was driving in a narrow lane, when the wheel of the pony-cart
    came off. I was standing there, thinking what I should do next, when a
    whole crowd of horsemen in "pink" came leaping over the hedge into the
    lane. One of them stopped and asked if he could do anything. Then he
    looked hard at me and exclaimed: "Good God! it's Nelly!"


    The man was Charles Reade.


    "Where have you been all these years?" he said.


    "I have been having a very happy time," I answered.


    "Well, you've had it long enough. Come back to the stage!"


    "No, never!"


    "You're a fool! You ought to come back."


    Suddenly I remembered the bailiff in the house a few miles away, and I
    said laughingly: "Well, perhaps, I would think of it if some one would
    give me forty pounds a week!"


    "Done!" said Charles Reade. "I'll give you that, and more, if you'll
    come and play Philippa Chester in 'The Wandering Heir.'"


    He went on to explain that Mrs. John Wood, who had been playing Philippa
    at the New Queen's, of which he was the lessee, would have to relinquish
    the part soon, because she was under contract to appear elsewhere. The
    piece was a great success, and promised to run a long time if he could
    find a good Philippa to replace Mrs. Wood. It was a kind of Rosalind
    part, and Charles Reade only exaggerated pardonably when he said that I
    should never have any part better suited to me!


    In a very short time after that meeting in the lane, it was announced
    that the new Philippa was to be an actress who was returning to the
    stage "after a long period of retirement." Only just before the first
    night did anyone guess who it was, and then there was great excitement
    among those who remembered me. The acclamation with which I was welcomed
    back on the first night surprised me. The papers were more flattering
    than they had ever been before. It was a tremendous success for me, and
    I was all the more pleased because I was following an accomplished
    actress in the part.


    It is curious how often I have "followed" others. I never "created" a
    part, as theatrical parlance has it, until I played Olivia at the Court,
    and I had to challenge comparison, in turn, with Miss Marie Wilton, Mrs.
    John Wood and Mrs. Kendal. Perhaps it was better for me than if I had
    had parts specially written for me, and with which no other names were
    associated.


    The hero of "The Wandering Heir," when I first took up the part of
    Philippa, was played by Edmund Leathes, but afterward by 
    Johnston
    Forbes-Robertson. Everyone knows how good-looking he is now, but as a
    boy he was wonderful       a dreamy, poetic-looking creature in a blue smock,
    far more of an artist than an actor       he promised to paint quite
    beautifully       and full of aspirations and ideals. In those days began a
    friendship between us which has lasted unbroken until this moment. His
    father and mother were delightful people, and very kind to me always.


    Everyone was kind to me at this time. Friends whom I had thought would
    be estranged by my long absence rallied round me and welcomed me as if
    it were six minutes instead of six years since I had dropped out of
    their ken. I was not yet a "made" woman, but I had a profitable
    engagement, and a delightful one, too, with Charles Reade, and I felt an
    enthusiasm for my work which had been wholly absent when I had returned
    to the stage the first time. My children were left in the country at
    first, but they came up and joined me when, in the year following "The
    Wandering Heir," I went to the Bancrofts at the
    Prince of Wales's. I
    never had the slightest fear of leaving them to their own devices, for
    they always knew how to amuse themselves, and were very independent and
    dependable in spite of their extreme youth. I have often thanked Heaven
    since that, with all their faults, my boy and girl have never been lazy
    and never dull. At this time Teddy always had a pencil in his hand, when
    he wasn't looking for his biscuit       he was a greedy little thing!       and Edy was hammering clothes onto her dolls with tin-tacks! Teddy said
    poetry beautifully, and when he and his sister were still tiny mites,
    they used to go through scene after scene of "As You Like It," for their
    own amusement, not for an audience, in the wilderness at
    Hampton Court.
    They were by no means prodigies, but it did not surprise me that my son,
    when he grew up, should be first a good actor, then an artist of some
    originality, and should finally turn all his brains and industry to new
    developments in the art of the theater. My daughter has acted also       not
    enough to please me, for I have a very firm belief in her talents       and
    has shown again and again that she can design and make clothes for the
    stage that are both lovely and effective. In all my most successful
    stage dresses lately she has had a hand, and if I had anything to do
    with a national theater, I should, without prejudice, put her in charge
    of the wardrobe at once!

    I may be a proud parent, but I have always refrained from "pushing" my
    children. They have had to fight for themselves, and to their mother
    their actual achievements have mattered very little. So long as they
    were not lazy, I have always felt that I could forgive them anything!


    And now Teddy and Edy       Teddy in a minute white piqué suit, and Edy in a
    tiny kimono, in which she looked as Japanese as everything which
    surrounded her       disappear from these pages for quite a long time. But
    all this time, you must understand, they are educating their mother!


    Charles Reade, having brought me back to the stage, and being my manager
    into the bargain, was deeply concerned about my progress as an actress.
    During the run of "The Wandering Heir" he used to sit in a private box
    every night to watch the play, and would send me round notes between
    the acts, telling me what I had done ill and what well in the preceding
    act. Dear, kind, unjust, generous, cautious, impulsive, passionate,
    gentle Charles Reade. Never have I known anyone who combined so many
    qualities, far asunder as the poles, in one single disposition. He was
    placid and turbulent, yet always majestic. He was inexplicable and
    entirely lovable       a stupid old dear, and as wise as Solomon! He seemed
    guileless, and yet had moments of suspicion and craftiness worthy of the
    wisdom of the serpent. One moment he would call me "dearest child"; the
    next, with indignant emphasis, "Madam!"


    When "The Wandering Heir" had at last exhausted its great popularity, I
    went on a tour with Charles Reade in several of his plays. In spite of
    his many and varied interests, he had entirely succumbed to the magic of
    the "irresistible theater," and it used to strike me as rather pathetic
    to see a man of his power and originality working the stage sea at
    nights, in company with a rough lad, in his dramatic version of "Hard
    Cash." In this play, which was known as "Our Seaman," I had a part which
    I could not bear to be paid twenty-five pounds a week for acting. I knew
    that the tour was not a financial success, and I ventured to suggest
    that it would be good economy to get some one else for Susan Merton. For
    answer I got a fiery "Madam, you are a rat! You desert a sinking ship!"
    My dear old companion, Boo, who was with me, resented this very much:
    "How can you say such things to my Nelly?"


    "Your Nelly!" said Charles Reade. "I love her a thousand times better
    than you do, or any puling woman."


    Another time he grew white with rage, and his dark eyes blazed, because
    the same "puling woman" said very lightly and playfully: "Why did poor
    Nell come home from rehearsal looking so tired yesterday? You work her
    too hard." He thought this unfair, as the work had to be done, and
    flamed out at us with such violence that it was almost impossible to
    identify him with the kind old gentleman of the Colonel Newcome type
    whom I had seen stand up at the Tom Taylors', on Sunday evenings, and
    sing "The Girl I Left Behind Me" with such pathos that he himself was
    moved to tears. But, though it was a painful time for both of us, it was
    almost worth while to quarrel with him, because when we made it up he
    was sure to give me some "treat"       a luncheon, a present, or a drive. We
    both felt we needed some jollification because we had suffered so much
    from being estranged. He used to say that there should be no such word
    as "quarrel," and one morning he wrote me a letter with the following
    postscript written in big letters:


  
                   "THERE DO EXIST SUCH THINGS AS HONEST MISUNDERSTANDINGS.

                  
"There, my Eleanora Delicia" (this was his name for me, my real, full name being Ellen Alicia), "stick that up in some place where you will often see it. Better put it on your looking-glass. And if you can once get those words into your noddle, it will save you a world of unhappiness."

  


    I think he was quite right about this. Would that he had been as right
    in his theories about stage management! He was a rare one for realism.
    He had preached it in all his plays, and when he produced a one-act
    play, "Rachael the Reaper," in front of "The Wandering Heir," he began
    to practice what he preached       jumped into reality up to the neck!


    He began by buying real pigs, real sheep, a real goat, and a
    real dog. Real litter was strewn all over the stage, much to the
    inconvenience of the unreal farm-laborer, Charles Kelly, who could not
    compete with it, although he looked as like a farmer as any actor could.
    They all looked their parts better than the real wall which ran across
    the stage, piteously naked of real shadows, owing to the absence of
    the real sun, and, of course, deficient in the painted shadows which
    make a painted wall look so like the real thing.


    Never, never can I forget Charles Reade's arrival at the theater in a
    four-wheeler with a goat and a lot of little pigs. When the cab drew up
    at the stage-door, the goat seemed to say, as plainly as any goat could:
    "I'm dashed if I stay in this cab any longer with these pigs!" and while
    Charles Reade was trying to pacify it, the piggies escaped!
    Unfortunately, they didn't all go in the same direction, and poor dear
    Charles Reade had a "divided duty." There was the goat, too, in a nasty
    mood. Oh, his serious face, as he decided to leave the goat and run for
    the pigs, with his loose trousers, each one a yard wide at least,
    flapping in the wind!


    "That's a relief, at any rate," said Charles Kelly, who was watching the
    flight of the pigs. "I sha'n't have those d              d pigs to spoil my acting
    as well as the d              d dog and the d              d goat!"


    How we all laughed when Charles Reade returned from the pig-hunt to
    rehearsal with the brief direction to the stage manager that the pigs
    would be "cut out."


    The reason for the real wall was made more evident when the real goat
    was tied up to it. A painted wall would never have stood such a strain.


    On the first night, the real dog bit Kelly's real ankles, and in real
    anger he kicked the real animal by a real mistake into the orchestra's
    real drum.


    So much for realism as practiced by Charles Reade! There was still
    something to remind him of the experiment in Rachael, the circus goat.
    Rachael       he was no she, but what of that?       was given the free run of the
    garden of Reade's house at Knightsbridge. He had everything that any
    normal goat could desire       a rustic stable, a green lawn, the best of
    food. Yet Rachael pined and grew thinner and thinner. One night when we
    were all sitting at dinner, with the French windows open onto the lawn
    because it was a hot night, Rachael came prancing into the room, looking
    happy, lively, and quite at home. All the time, while Charles Reade had
    been fashing himself to provide every sort of rural joy for his goat,
    the ungrateful beast had been longing for the naphtha lights of the
    circus, for lively conversation and the applause of the crowd.


    You can't force a goat any more than you can force a child to live the
    simple life. "N'Yawk's the place," said the child of a Bowery tenement
    in New York, on the night of her return from an enforced sojourn in
    Arcady. She hated picking daisies, and drinking rich new milk made her
    sick. When the kind teacher who had brought her to the country strove to
    impress her by taking her to see a cow milked, she remarked witheringly
    to the man who was milking: "Gee! You put it in!"


    Rachael's sentiments were of the same type, I think. "Back to the
    circus!" was his cry, not "Back to the land!"


    I hope, when he felt the sawdust under his feet again (I think Charles
    Reade sent him back to the ring), he remembered his late master with
    gratitude. To how many animals, and not only four-footed ones, was not
    Charles Reade generously kind, and to none of them more kind than to
    Ellen Terry.

          

    V
    THE ACTRESS AND THE PLAYWRIGHT
    THE END OF MY APPRENTICESHIP
    1874


    The relation between author and actor is a very important element in the
    life of the stage. It is the way with some dramatists to despise those
    who interpret their plays, to accuse us of ruining their creations, to
    suffer disappointment and rage because we do not, or cannot, carry out
    their ideas.


    Other dramatists admit that we players can teach them something; but I
    have noticed that it is generally in "the other fellow's" play that we
    can teach them, not in their own!


    As they are necessary to us, and we to them, the great thing is to
    reduce friction by sympathy. The actor should understand that the author
    can be of use to him; the author, on his side, should believe that the
    actor can be of service to the author, and sometimes in ways which only
    a long and severe training in the actor's trade can discover.


    The first author with whom I had to deal, at a critical point in my
    progress as an actress, was Charles Reade, and he helped me enormously.
    He might, and often did, make twelve suggestions that were wrong; but
    against them he would make one that was so right that its value was
    immeasurable and unforgettable.


    It is through the dissatisfaction of a man like Charles Reade that an
    actress learns       that is, if she is not conceited. Conceit is an
    insuperable obstacle to all progress. On the other hand, it is of little
    use to take criticism in a slavish spirit and to act on it without
    understanding it. Charles Reade constantly wrote and said things to me
    which were not absolutely just criticism; but they directed my attention
    to the true cause of the faults which he found in my performance, and
    put me on the way to mending them.


    A letter which he wrote me during the run of "The Wandering Heir" was
    such a wonderful lesson to me that I am going to quote it almost in
    full, in the hope that it may be a lesson to other actresses       "happy in
    this, they are not yet so old but they can learn"; unhappy in this, that
    they have never had a Charles Reade to give them a trouncing!


    Well, the letter begins with sheer eulogy. Eulogy is nice, but one does
    not learn anything from it. Had dear Charles Reade stopped after writing
    "womanly grace, subtlety, delicacy, the variety yet invariable
    truthfulness of the facial expression, compared with which the faces
    beside yours are wooden, uniform dolls," he would have done nothing to
    advance me in my art; but this was only the jam in which I was to take
    the powder!


    Here followed more jam       with the first taste of the powder:


  
                   "I prefer you for my Philippa to any other actress, and shall do so still, even if you will not, or cannot, throw more vigor into the lines that need it. I do not pretend to be as good a writer of plays as you are an actress [how naughty of him!], but I do pretend to be a great judge of acting in general. [He wasn't, although in particular details he was a brilliant critic and adviser.] And I know how my own lines and business ought to be rendered infinitely better than any one else, except the
Omniscient. It is only on this narrow ground I presume to teach a woman of your gifts. If I teach you Philippa, you will teach me Juliet; for I am very sure that when I have seen you act her, I shall know a vast deal more about her than I do at present.

                  
"No great quality of an actress is absent from your performance. Very often you have vigor. But in other places where it is as much required, or even more, you turn limp. You have limp lines, limp business, and in Act III. limp exits instead of ardent exits.      

  


    Except in the actual word used, he was perfectly right. I was not
    limp, but I was exhausted. By a natural instinct, I had produced my
    voice scientifically almost from the first, and I had found out for
    myself many things, which in these days of Delsarte systems and the
    science of voice-production, are taught. But when, after my six years'
    absence from the stage, I came back, and played a long and arduous part,
    I found that my breathing was still not right. This accounted for my
    exhaustion, or limpness and lack of vigor, as Charles Reade preferred to
    call it.


    As for the "ardent" exits, how right he was! That word set me on the
    track of learning the value of moving off the stage with a swift rush. I
    had always had the gift of being rapid in movement, but to have a
    gift, and to use it, are two very different things.


    I never realized that I was rather quick in movement until one day when
    I was sitting on a sofa talking to the famous throat specialist,
    Dr. Morell Mackenzie. In the middle of one of his sentences I said: "Wait a
    minute while I get a glass of water." I was out of the room and back so
    soon that he said, "Well, go and get it then!" and was paralyzed when he
    saw that the glass was in my hand and that I was sitting down again!


    Consider! That was one of Charles Reade's favorite expressions, and
    just hearing him say the word used to make me consider, and think, and
    come to conclusions       perhaps not always the conclusions that he wished,
    but suggested by him.


    In this matter of "ardent" exit, he wrote:


  
                   "The swift rush of the words, the personal rush, should carry you off the stage. It is in reality as easy as shelling peas, if you will only go by the right method instead of by the wrong. You have overcome far greater difficulties than this, yet night after night you go on suffering ignoble defeat at this point. Come, courage! You took a leaf out of Reade's dictionary at Manchester, and trampled on two difficulties       impossibilities, you called them.
That was on Saturday, Monday you knocked the poor impossibilities down. Tuesday you kicked them where they lay. Wednesday you walked placidly over their prostrate bodies!"

  


    The difficulty that he was now urging me to knock down was one of
    pace, and I am afraid that in all my stage life subsequently I never
    quite succeeded in kicking it or walking over its prostrate body!


    Looking backward, I remember many times when I failed in rapidity of
    utterance, and was "pumped" at moments when swiftness was essential.
    Pace is the soul of comedy, and to elaborate lines at the expense of
    pace is disastrous. Curiously enough, I have met and envied this gift of
    pace in actors who were not conspicuously talented in other respects,
    and no Rosalind that I have ever seen has had enough of it. Of course,
    it is not a question of swift utterance only, but of swift thinking. I
    am able to think more swiftly on the stage now than at the time Charles
    Reade wrote to me, and I only wish I were young enough to take advantage
    of it. But youth thinks slowly, as a rule.


    Vary the pace. Charles Reade was never tired of saying this, and,
    indeed, it is one of the foundations of all good acting.


  
                   "You don't seem quite to realize," he writes in the letter before me, "that uniformity of pace leads inevitably to languor. You should deliver a pistol-shot or two. Remember Philippa is a fiery girl; she can snap. If only for variety, she should snap James' head off when she says, 'Do I speak as if I loved them!'"

  


    My memories of the part of Philippa are rather vague, but I know that
    Reade was right in insisting that I needed more "bite" in the passages
    when I was dressed as a boy. Though he complimented me on my self-denial
    in making what he called "some sacrifice of beauty" to pass for a boy,
    "so that the audience can't say, 'Why, James must be a fool not to see
    she is a girl,'" he scolded me for my want of bluntness.


  
                   "Fix your mind on the adjective 'blunt' and the substantive       'pistol-shot'; they will do you good service."

  


    They did! And I recommend them to anyone who finds it hard to overcome
    monotony of pace and languor of diction.


  
                   "When you come to tell old Surefoot about his daughter's love," the letter goes on, "you should fall into a positive imitation of his manner: crest, motionless, and hands in front, and deliver your preambles with a nasal twang. But at the second invitation to speak out, you should cast this to the winds, and go into the other extreme of bluntness and rapidity. [Quite right!] When you meet him after the exposure, you should speak as you are coming to him and stop him in mid-career, and then attack him. You should also (in Act II.) get the pearls back into the tree before you say: 'Oh, I hope he did not see me!'"

  


    Yes, I remember that in both these places I used to muddle and blur the
    effect by doing the business and speaking at the same time. By acting on
    Reade's suggestion I gained confidence in making a pause.

  
                   "After the beating, wait at least ten seconds longer than you do       to rouse expectation       and when you do come on, make a little more of it. You ought to be very pale indeed       even to enter with a slight totter, done moderately, of course; and before you say a single word, you ought to stand shaking and with your brows knitting, looking almost terrible. Of course, I do not expect or desire to make a melodramatic actress of you, but still I think you capable of any effect, provided it is not sustained too long."

  


    A truer word was never spoken. It has never been in my power to
    sustain. In private life, I cannot sustain a hatred or a resentment.
    On the stage, I can pass swiftly from one effect to another, but I
    cannot fix one, and dwell on it, with that superb concentration which
    seems to me the special attribute of the tragic actress. To sustain,
    with me, is to lose the impression that I have created, not to increase
    its intensity.


  
                   "The last passage of the third act is just a little too hurried. Break the line. 'Now, James       for England and liberty!'"

  


    I remember that I never could see that he was right about that, and if I
    can't see a thing I can't do it. The author's idea must become mine
    before I can carry it out       at least, with any sincerity, and obedience
    without sincerity would be of small service to an author. It must be
    despairing to him, if he wants me to say a line in a certain way, to
    find that I always say it in another; but I can't help it. I have tried
    to act passages as I have been told, just because I was told and
    without conviction, and I have failed miserably and have had to go back
    to my own way.


  
                   "Climax is reached not only by rush but by increasing pace. Your exit speech is a failure at present, because you do not vary the pace of its delivery. Get by yourself for one half-hour       if you can! Get by the seaside, if you can, since there it was Demosthenes studied eloquence and overcame mountains       not mole-hills like this. Being by the seaside, study those lines by themselves: 'And then let them find their young gentleman, and find him quickly, for London shall not hold me long       no, nor England either.'

                  
"Study to speak these lines with great volubility and fire, and settle the exact syllable to run at."

  


    I remember that Reade, with characteristic generosity, gave me ten
    pounds and sent me to the seaside in earnest, as he suggests my doing,
    half in fun, in the letter. "I know you won't go otherwise," he said,
    "because you want to insure your life or do something of that sort.
    Here! go to Brighton       go anywhere by the sea for Sunday! Don't thank me!
    It's all for Philippa."


    As I read these notes of his on anti-climax, monotony of pace, and all
    the other offenses against scientific principles of acting which I
    committed in this one part, I feel more strongly than ever how important
    it is to master these principles. Until you have learned them and
    practiced them you cannot afford to discard them. There is all the
    difference in the world between departure from recognized rules by one
    who has learned to obey them, and neglect of them through want of
    training or want of skill or want of understanding. Before you can be
    eccentric you must know where the circle is.


    This is accepted, I am told, even in shorthand, where the pupil acquires
    the knowledge of a number of signs, only for the purpose of discarding
    them when he is proficient enough to make an individual system. It is
    also accepted in music, where only the advanced pianist or singer can
    afford to play tricks with tempo. And I am sure it should be accepted
    in acting.


    Nowadays acting is less scientific (except in the matter of
    voice-production) than it was when I was receiving hints, cautions, and
    advice from my two dramatist friends, Charles Reade and Tom Taylor; and
    the leading principles to which they attached importance have come to be
    regarded as old-fashioned and superfluous. This attitude is
    comparatively harmless in the interpretation of those modern plays in
    which parts are made to fit the actors and personality is everything.
    But those who have been led to believe that they can make their own
    rules find their mistake when they come to tackle Shakespeare or any of
    the standard dramatists in which the actors have to fit themselves to
    the parts. Then, if ever, technique is avenged!


    All my life the thing which has struck me as wanting on the stage is
    variety. Some people are "tone-deaf," and they find it physically
    impossible to observe the law of contrasts. But even a physical
    deficiency can be overcome by that faculty for taking infinite pains
    which may not be genius but is certainly a good substitute for it.


    When it comes to pointing out an example, Henry Irving is the monument,
    the great mark set up to show the genius of will. For years he worked
    to overcome the dragging leg, which seemed to attract more attention
    from some small-minded critics (sharp of eye, yet how dull of vision!)
    than all the mental splendor of his impersonations. He toiled, and he
    overcame this defect, just as he overcame his disregard of the vowels
    and the self-consciousness which in the early stages of his career used
    to hamper and incommode him. His self was to him on a first night what
    the shell is to a lobster on dry land. In "Hamlet," when we first acted
    together after that long-ago Katherine and Petruchio period at the
    Queen's, he used to discuss with me the secret of my freedom from
    self-consciousness; and I suggested a more swift entrance on the stage
    from the dressing-room. I told him that, in spite of the advantage in
    ease which I had gained through having been on the stage when still a
    mere child, I should be paralyzed with fright from over-acute
    realization of the audience if I stood at the wing for ten minutes, as
    he was in the habit of doing. He did not need me then, nor during the
    run of our next play, "The Lady of Lyons"; but when it came to Shylock,
    a quite new part to him, he tried the experiment, and, as he told me,
    with great comfort to himself and success with the audience.

    Only a great actor finds the difficulties of the actor's art infinite.
    Even up to the last five years of his life, Henry Irving was striving,
    striving. He never rested on old triumphs, never found a part in which
    there was no more to do. Once when I was touring with him in America, at
    the time when he was at the highest point of his fame, I watched him
    one day in the train       always a delightful occupation, for his face
    provided many pictures a minute       and being struck by a curious look,
    half puzzled, half despairing, asked him what he was thinking about.


    "I was thinking," he answered slowly, "how strange it is that I should
    have made the reputation I have as an actor, with nothing to help
    me       with no equipment. My legs, my voice       everything has been against
    me. For an actor who can't walk, can't talk, and has no face to speak
    of, I've done pretty well."


    And I, looking at that splendid head, those wonderful hands, the whole
    strange beauty of him, thought, "Ah, you little know!"

    PORTIA
    1875 


    The brilliant story of the Bancroft management of the old
    Prince of
    Wales's Theater was more familiar twenty years back than it is now. I
    think that few of the youngest playgoers who point out, on the first
    nights of important productions, a remarkably striking figure of a man

    Bancroft could give any adequate account of what he did for the English
    theater in the 'seventies. Nor do the public who see an elegant little
    lady starting for a drive from a certain house in Berkeley Square
    realize that this is Marie Wilton, afterward Mrs. Bancroft, now Lady
    Bancroft, the comedienne who created the heroines of Tom Robertson, and,
    with her husband, brought what is called the cup-and-saucer drama to
    absolute perfection.


    We players know quite well and accept with philosophy the fact that when
    we have done we are forgotten. We are sometimes told that we live too
    much in the public eye and enjoy too much public favor and attention;
    but at least we make up for it by leaving no trace of our short and
    merry reign behind us when it is over!


    I have never, even in Paris, seen anything more admirable than the
    ensemble of the Bancroft productions. Every part in the domestic
    comedies, the presentation of which, up to 1875, they had made their
    policy, was played with such point and finish that the more rough,
    uneven, and emotional acting of the present day has not produced
    anything so good in the same line. The Prince of Wales's Theater was the
    most fashionable in London, and there seemed no reason why the triumph
    of Robertson should not go on for ever.


    But that's the strange thing about theatrical success. However great, it
    is limited in its force and duration, as we found out at the Lyceum
    twenty years later. It was not only because the Bancrofts were ambitious
    that they determined on a Shakespearean revival in 1875: they felt that
    you can give the public too much even of a good thing, and thought that
    a complete change might bring their theater new popularity as well as
    new honor.


    I, however, thought little of this at the time. After my return to the
    stage in "The Wandering Heir" and my tour with Charles Reade, my
    interest in the theater again declined. It has always been my fate or my
    nature       perhaps they are really the same thing       to be very happy or
    very miserable. At this time I was very miserable. I was worried to
    death by domestic troubles and financial difficulties. The house in
    which I first lived in London, after I left Hertfordshire, had been
    dismantled of some of its most beautiful treasures by the brokers.
    Pressure was being put on me by well-meaning friends to leave this house
    and make a great change in my life. Everything was at its darkest when
    Mrs. Bancroft came to call on me and offered me the part of Portia in
    "The Merchant of Venice."


    I had, of course, known her before, in the way that all people in the
    theater seem to know each other, and I had seen her act; but on this
    day, when she came to me as a kind of messenger of Fate, the harbinger
    of the true dawn of my success, she should have had for me some special
    and extraordinary significance. I could invest that interview now with
    many dramatic features, but my memory, either because it is bad or
    because it is good, corrects my imagination.


    "May I come in?"


    An ordinary remark, truly, to stick in one's head for thirty-odd years!
    But it was made in such a very pretty voice       one of the most silvery
    voices I have ever heard from any woman except the late Queen Victoria,
    whose voice was like a silver stream flowing over golden stones.


    The smart little figure       Mrs. Bancroft was, above all things,
    petite       dressed in black       elegant Parisian black       came into a room
    which had been almost completely stripped of furniture. The floor was
    covered with Japanese matting, and at one end was a cast of the Venus
    of Milo, almost the same colossal size as the original.


    Mrs. Bancroft's wonderful gray eyes, examined it curiously. The room,
    the statue, and I myself must all have seemed very strange to her. I
    wore a dress of some deep yellow woolen material which my little
    daughter used to call the "frog dress," because it was speckled with
    brown like a frog's skin. It was cut like a Viollet-le-Duc tabard, and
    had not a trace of the fashion of the time. Mrs. Bancroft, however, did
    not look at me less kindly because I wore aesthetic clothes and was
    painfully thin. She explained that they were going to put on "The
    Merchant of Venice" at the Prince of Wales's, that she was to rest for a
    while for reasons connected with her health; that she and Mr. Bancroft
    had thought of me for Portia.


    Portia! It seemed too good to be true! I was a student when I was young.
    I knew not only every word of the part, but every detail of that period
    of Venetian splendor in which the action of the play takes place. I had
    studied Vecellio. Now I am old, it is impossible for me to work like
    that, but I never acknowledge that I get on as well without it.


    Mrs. Bancroft told me that the production would be as beautiful as money
    and thought could make it. The artistic side of the venture was to be in
    the hands of Mr. Godwin, who had designed my dress for Titania at
    Bristol.


    "Well, what do you say?" said Mrs. Bancroft. "Will you put your shoulder
    to the wheel with us?"


    I answered incoherently and joyfully, that of all things I had been
    wanting most to play in Shakespeare; that in Shakespeare I had always
    felt I would play for half the salary; that       oh, I don't know what I
    said! Probably it was all very foolish and unbusinesslike, but the
    engagement was practically settled before Mrs. Bancroft left the house,
    although I was charged not to say anything about it yet.


    But theater secrets are generally secrets de polichinelle. When I went
    to Charles Reade's house at Albert Gate on the following Sunday for one
    of his regular Sunday parties, he came up to me at once with a knowing
    look and said:


    "So you've got an engagement."


    "I'm not to say anything about it."


    "It's in Shakespeare!"


    "I'm not to tell."


    "But I know. I've been thinking it out. It's 'The Merchant of Venice.'"


    "Nothing is settled yet. It's on the cards."


    "I know! I know!" said wise old Charles. "Well, you'll never have such a
    good part as Philippa Chester!"


    "No, Nelly, never!" said Mrs. Seymour, who happened to overhear this.
    "They call Philippa a Rosalind part. Rosalind! Rosalind is not to be
    compared with it!"


    Between Mrs. Seymour and Charles Reade existed a friendship of that rare
    sort about which it is easy for people who are not at all rare,
    unfortunately, to say ill-natured things. Charles Reade worshiped Laura
    Seymour, and she understood him and sympathized with his work and his
    whims. She died before he did, and he never got over it. The great
    success of one of his last plays, "Drink," an adaptation from the
    French, in which Charles Warner is still thrilling audiences to this
    day, meant nothing to him because she was not alive to share it. The "In
    Memoriam" which he had inscribed over her grave is characteristic of the
    man, the woman, and their friendship:

HERE LIES THE GREAT HEART OF
LAURA SEYMOUR


    I liked Mrs. Seymour so much that I was hurt when I found that she had
    instructed Charles Reade to tell Nelly Terry "not to paint her face" in
    the daytime, and I was young enough to enjoy revenging myself in my own
    way. We used to play childish games at Charles Reade's house sometimes,
    and with "Follow my leader" came my opportunity. I asked for a basin of
    water and a towel and scrubbed my face with a significant thoroughness.
    The rules of the game meant that everyone had to follow my example! When
    I had dried my face I powdered it, and then darkened my eyebrows. I
    wished to be quite frank about the harmless little bit of artifice which
    Mrs. Seymour had exaggerated into a crime. She was now hoist with her
    own petard, for, being heavily made up, she could not and would not
    follow the leader. After this Charles Reade acquitted me of the use of
    "pigments red," but he still kept up a campaign against "Chalky," as he
    humorously christened my powder-puff. "Don't be pig-headed, love," he
    wrote to me once; "it is because Chalky does not improve you that I
    forbid it. Trust unprejudiced and friendly eyes and drop it altogether."


    Although Mrs. Seymour was naturally prejudiced where Charles Reade's
    work was concerned, she only spoke the truth, pardonably exaggerated,
    about the part of Philippa Chester. I know no part which is a patch on
    it for effectiveness; yet there is little in it of the stuff which
    endures. The play itself was too unbusiness like ever to become a
    classic.


    Not for years afterwards did I find out that I was not the "first
    choice" for Portia. The Bancrofts had tried the Kendals first, with the
    idea of making a double engagement; but the negotiations failed. Perhaps
    the rivalry between Mrs. Kendal and me might have become of more
    significance had she appeared as Portia at the Prince of Wales's and
    preferred Shakespeare to domestic comedy. In after years she played
    Rosalind       I never did, alas!       and quite recently acted with me in "The
    Merry Wives of Windsor"; but the best of her fame will always be
    associated with such plays as "The Squire," "The Ironmaster," "Lady Clancarty," and many more plays of that type. When she played with me in
    Shakespeare she laughingly challenged me to come and play with her in a
    modern piece, a domestic play, and I said, "Done!" but it has not been
    done yet, although in Mrs. Clifford's "The Likeness of the Night" there
    was a good medium for the experiment. I found Mrs. Kendal wonderful to
    act with. No other English actress has such extraordinary skill. Of
    course, people have said we are jealous of each other. "Ellen Terry Acts
    with Lifelong Enemy," proclaimed an American newspaper in five-inch
    type, when we played together as Mistress Page and Mistress Ford in
    Mr.
    Tree's Coronation production of "The Merry Wives of Windsor." But the
    enmity did not seem to worry us as much as the newspaper men over the
    Atlantic had represented.


    It was during this engagement in 1902 that a young actor who was
    watching us coming in at the stage-door at His Majesty's one day is
    reported to have said: "Look at Mr. Tree between his two 'stars'!"


    "You mean Ancient Lights!" answered the witty actress to whom the remark
    was made.


    However, "e'en in our ashes burn our wonted fires," or, to descend from
    the sublime to the ridiculous, and from the poetry of Gray to the
    pantomime gag of Drury Lane and Herbert Campbell, "Better to be a good
    old has-been than a never-was-er!"


    But it was long before the "has-been" days that Mrs. Kendal decided not
    to bring her consummately dexterous and humorous workmanship to the task
    of playing Portia, and left the field open for me. My fires were only
    just beginning to burn. Success I had had of a kind, and I had tasted
    the delight of knowing that audiences liked me, and had liked them back
    again. But never until I appeared as Portia at the Prince of Wales's had
    I experienced that awe-struck feeling which comes, I suppose, to no
    actress more than once in a lifetime       the feeling of the conqueror. In
    homely parlance, I knew that I had "got them" at the moment when I spoke
    the speech beginning, "You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand."


    "What can this be?" I thought. "Quite this thing has never come to me
    before! This is different! It has never been quite the same before."


    It was never to be quite the same again.


    Elation, triumph, being lifted on high by a single stroke of the mighty
    wing of glory       call it by any name, think of it as you like       it was as
    Portia that I had my first and last sense of it. And, while it made me
    happy, it made me miserable because I foresaw, as plainly as my own
    success, another's failure.

          

    
    

          

    ELLEN TERRY AS PORTIA

    From the collection of Miss Evelyn Smalley

          

    Charles Coghlan, an actor whose previous record was fine enough to
    justify his engagement as Shylock, showed that night the fatal quality
    of indecision.


    A worse performance than his, carried through with decision and attack,
    might have succeeded, but Coghlan's Shylock was not even bad. It was
    nothing.


    You could hardly hear a word he said. He spoke as though he had a sponge
    in his mouth, and moved as if paralyzed. The perspiration poured down
    his face; yet what he was doing no one could guess. It was a case of
    moral cowardice rather than incompetency. At rehearsals no one had
    entirely believed in him, and this, instead of stinging him into a
    resolution to triumph, had made him take fright and run away.


    People felt that they were witnessing a great play with a great part cut
    out, and "The Merchant of Venice" ran for three weeks!


    It was a pity, if only because a more gorgeous and complete little
    spectacle had never been seen on the English stage. Veronese's "Marriage
    in Cana" had inspired many of the stage pictures, and the expenditure in
    carrying them out had been lavish.


    In the casket scene I wore a dress like almond-blossom. I was very thin,
    but Portia and all the ideal young heroines of Shakespeare ought to
    be thin. Fat is fatal to ideality!


    I played the part more stiffly and more slowly at the Prince of Wales's
    than I did in later years. I moved and spoke slowly. The clothes seemed
    to demand it, and the setting of the play developed the Italian feeling
    in it, and let the English Elizabethan side take care of itself. The
    silver casket scene with the Prince of Aragon was preserved, and so was
    the last act, which had hitherto been cut out in nearly all stage
    versions.


    I have tried five or six different ways of treating Portia, but the way
    I think best is not the one which finds the heartiest response from my
    audiences. Has there ever been a dramatist, I wonder, whose parts admit
    of as many different interpretations as do Shakespeare's? There lies his
    immortality as an acting force. For times change, and parts have to be
    acted differently for different generations. Some parts are not
    sufficiently universal for this to be possible, but every ten years an
    actor can reconsider a Shakespeare part and find new life in it for his
    new purpose and new audiences.


    The aesthetic craze, with all its faults, was responsible for a great
    deal of true enthusiasm for anything beautiful. It made people welcome
    the Bancrofts' production of "The Merchant of Venice" with an
    appreciation which took the practical form of an offer to keep the
    performances going by subscription, as the general public was not
    supporting them. Sir Frederick and Lady Pollock,
    James Spedding,
    Edwin
    Arnold, Sir Frederick Leighton and others made the proposal to the Bancrofts, but nothing came of it.


    Short as the run of the play was, it was a wonderful time for me.
    Everyone seemed to be in love with me! I had sweethearts by the dozen,
    known and unknown. Most of the letters written to me I destroyed long
    ago, but the feeling of sweetness and light with which some of them
    filled me can never be destroyed. The task of reading and answering
    letters has been a heavy one all my life, but it would be ungrateful to
    complain of it. To some people expression is life itself. Half my
    letters begin: "I cannot help writing to tell you," and I believe that
    this is the simple truth. I, for one, should have been poorer, though my
    eyes might have been stronger, if they had been able to help it.


    There turns up to-day, out of a long-neglected box, a charming note
    about "The Merchant of Venice" from some unknown friend.


    "Playing to such houses," he wrote, "is not an encouraging pursuit; but
    to give to human beings the greatest pleasure that they are capable of
    receiving must always be worth doing. You have given me that pleasure,
    and I write to offer you my poor thanks. Portia has always been my
    favorite heroine, and I saw her last night as sweet and lovely as I had
    always hoped she might be. I hope that I shall see you again in other
    Shakespearean characters, and that nothing will tempt you to withhold
    your talents from their proper sphere."


    The audiences may have been scanty, but they were wonderful.
    O'Shaughnessy, Watts-Dunton,
    Oscar Wilde, Alfred Gilbert, and, I think
    Swinburne were there. A poetic and artistic atmosphere pervaded the
    front of the house as well as the stage itself.

    TOM TAYLOR AND LAVENDER SWEEP


    I have read in some of the biographies of me that have been published
    from time to time, that I was chagrined at Coghlan's fiasco because it
    brought my success as Portia so soon to an end. As a matter of fact, I
    never thought about it. I was just sorry for clever Coghlan, who was
    deeply hurt and took his defeat hardly and moodily. He wiped out the
    public recollection of it to a great extent by his Evelyn in "Money,"
    Sir Charles Pomander in "Masks and Faces," and Claude Melnotte in "The
    Lady of Lyons," which he played with me at the Princess's Theater for
    one night only in the August following the withdrawal of "The Merchant
    of Venice."


    I have been credited with great generosity for appearing in that single
    performance of "The Lady of Lyons." It was said that I wanted to help
    Coghlan reinstate himself, and so on. Very likely there was some such
    feeling in the matter, but there was also a good part and good
    remuneration! I remember that I played Lytton's proud heroine better
    then than I did at the Lyceum five years later, and Coghlan was more
    successful as Melnotte than Henry Irving. But I was never really good.
    I tried in vain to have sympathy with a lady who was addressed as
    "haughty cousin," yet whose very pride had so much inconsistency. How
    could any woman fall in love with a cad like Melnotte? I used to ask
    myself despairingly. The very fact that I tried to understand Pauline
    was against me. There is only one way to play her, and to be bothered by
    questions of sincerity and consistency means that you will miss that way
    for a certainty!


    I missed it, and fell between two stools. Finding that it was useless
    to depend upon feeling, I groped after the definite rules which had
    always governed the delivery of Pauline's fustian, and the fate that
    commonly overtakes those who try to put old wine into new bottles
    overtook me.


    I knew for instance, exactly how the following speech ought to be done,
    but I never could do it. It occurs in the fourth act, where Beauseant,
    after Pauline has been disillusioned, thinks it will be an easy matter
    to induce the proud beauty to fly with him:


  
                   "Go! (White to the lips.) Sir, leave this house! It is humble; but a husband's roof, however lowly, is, in the eyes of God and man, the temple of a wife's honor. (Tumultuous applause.) Know that I would rather starve       aye, starve       with him who has betrayed me than accept your lawful hand, even were you the prince whose name he bore. (Hurrying on quickly to prevent applause before the finish.) Go!"

  


    It is easy to laugh at Lytton's rhetoric, but very few dramatists have
    had a more complete mastery of theatrical situations, and that is a good
    thing to be master of. Why the word "theatrical" should have come to be
    used in a contemptuous sense I cannot understand. "Musical" is a word of
    praise in music; why not "theatrical" in a theater? A play in any age
    which holds the boards so continuously as "The Lady of Lyons" deserves
    more consideration than the ridicule of those who think that the world
    has moved on because our playwrights write more naturally than Lytton
    did. The merit of the play lay, not in its bombast, but in its
    situation.


    Before Pauline I had played Clara Douglas in a revival of "Money," and I
    found her far more interesting and possible. To act the balance of the
    girl was keen enjoyment; it foreshadowed some of that greater enjoyment
    I was to have in after years when playing Hermione       another well-judged,
    well-balanced mind, a woman who is not passion's slave, who never
    answers on the spur of the moment, but from the depths of reason and
    divine comprehension. I didn't agree with Clara Douglas's sentiments but
    I saw her point of view, and that was everything.


    Tom Taylor, like Charles Reade, never hesitated to speak plainly to me
    about my acting, and, after the first night of "Money," wrote me a
    letter full of hints and caution and advice:

                   "As I expected, you put feeling into every situation which gave you the opportunity, and the truth of your intention and expression seemed to bring a note of nature into the horribly sophisticated atmosphere of that hollow and most claptrappy of all Bulwerian stage offenses. Nothing could be better than the appeal to Evelyn in the last act. It was sweet, womanly and earnest, and rang true in every note.

                  
"But you were nervous and uncomfortable in many parts for want of sufficient rehearsal. These passages you will, no doubt, improve in nightly. I would only urge on you the great importance of studying to be quiet and composed, and not fidgeting. There was especially a trick of constantly twiddling with and looking at your fingers which you should, above all, be on your guard against.... I think, too, you showed too evident feeling in the earlier scene with Evelyn. A blind man must have read what you felt       your sentiment should be more masked.

                  
"Laura (Mrs. Taylor) absolutely hates the play. We both thought       detestable in his part, false in emphasis, violent and coarse. Generally the fault of the performance was, strange to say for that theater, overacting, want of repose, point, and finish. With you in essentials I was quite satisfied, but quiet       not so much movement of arms and hands. Bear this in mind for improvement; and go over your part to yourself with a view to it.

                  
"The Allinghams have been here to-day. They saw you twice as Portia, and were charmed. Mrs. Allingham wants to paint you. Allingham tells me that
Spedding is going to write an article on your Portia, and will include Clara Douglas. I am going to see
Salvini in 'Hamlet' to-morrow morning, but I would call in Charlotte Street between one and two, on the chance of seeing you and talking it over, and amplifying what I have said.

                  
"Ever your true old friend,

                  
"TOM TAYLOR."


    A true old friend indeed he was! I have already tried to convey how much
    I owed to him       how he stood by me and helped me in difficulties, and
    said generously and unequivocally, at the time of my separation from my
    first husband, that "the poor child was not to blame."


    I was very fond of my own father, but in many ways Tom Taylor was more
    of a father to me than my father in blood. Father was charming, but
    Irish and irresponsible. I think he loved my sister Floss and me most
    because we were the lawless ones of the family! It was not in his
    temperament to give wise advice and counsel. Having bequeathed to me
    light-heartedness and a sanguine disposition, and trained me splendidly
    for my profession in childhood, he became in after years a very
    cormorant for adulation of me!


    "Duchess, you might have been anything!" was his favorite comment, when
    I was not living up to his ideas of my position and attainments. And I
    used to answer: "I've played my cards for what I want."


    Years afterwards, when he and mother used to come to first nights at the
    Lyceum, the grossest flattery of me after the performance was not good
    enough for them.


    "How proud you must be of her!" someone would say. "How well this part
    suits her!"


    "Yes," father would answer, in a sort of "is-that-all-you-have-to-say"
    tone. "But she ought to play Rosalind!"


    To him I owe the gaiety of temperament which has enabled me to dance
    through the most harsh and desert passages of my life, just as he used
    to make Kate and me dance along the sordid London streets as we walked
    home from the Princess's Theater. He would make us come under his cloak,
    partly for warmth, partly to hide from us the stages of the journey
    home. From the comfortable darkness one of us would cry out:


    "Oh, I'm so tired! Aren't we nearly home? Where are we, father?"


    "You know Schwab, the baker?"


    "Yes, yes."


    "Well, we're not there yet!"


    As I grew up, this teasing, jolly, insouciant Irish father of mine was
    relieved of some of his paternal duties by Tom Taylor. It was not Nelly
    alone whom Tom Taylor fathered. He adopted the whole family.


    At Lavender Sweep, with the horse-chestnut blossoms strewing the drive
    and making it look like a tessellated pavement, all of us were always
    welcome, and Tom Taylor would often come to our house and ask mother to
    grill him a bone! Such intimate friendships are seldom possible in our
    busy profession, and there was never another Tom Taylor in my life.


    When we were not in London and could not go to Lavender Sweep to see
    him, he wrote almost daily to us. He was angry when other people
    criticised me, but he did not spare criticism himself.


    "Don't be Nelly Know-all," I remember his saying once. "I saw you
    floundering out of your depth to-night on the subject of butterflies!
    The man to whom you were talking is one of the greatest entomologists in
    Europe, and must have seen through you at once."


    When William Black's "Madcap Violet" was published, common report said
    that the heroine had been drawn for Ellen Terry, and some of the reviews
    made Taylor furious.


    "It's disgraceful! I shall deny it. Never will I let it be said of you
    that you could conceive any vulgarity. I shall write and contradict it.
    Indiscreet, high-spirited, full of surprises, you may be, but
    vulgar       never! I shall write at once."


    "Don't do that," I said. "Can't you see that the author hasn't described
    me, but only me in 'New Men and Old Acres'?" As this was Tom Taylor's
    own play, his rage against "Madcap Violet" was very funny! "There am I,
    just as you wrote it. My actions, manners, and clothes in the play are
    all reproduced. You ought to feel pleased, not angry."


    When his play "Victims" was being rehearsed at the Court Theater, an old
    woman and old actress who had, I think, been in the preceding play was
    not wanted. The day the management gave her her dismissal, she met
    Taylor outside the theater, and poured out a long story of distress. She
    had not a stocking to her foot, she owed her rent, she was starving.
    Wouldn't Mr. Taylor tell the management what dismissal meant to her?
    Wouldn't he get her taken back? Mr. Taylor would try, and Mr. Taylor
    gave her fifteen pounds in the street then and there!


    Mrs. Taylor wasn't surprised. She only wondered it wasn't thirty!


    "Tom the Adapter" was the Terry dramatist for many years. Kate played in
    many of the pieces which, some openly, some deviously, he brought into
    the English stage from the French. When Kate married, my turn came, and
    the interest that he had taken in my sister's talent he transferred in
    part to me, although I don't think he ever thought me her equal.
    Floss
    made her first appearance in the child's part in Taylor's play "A Sheep
    in Wolf's Clothing," and Marion her first appearance as Ophelia in his
    version of "Hamlet"       perhaps "perversion" would be an honester
    description! Taylor introduced a "fool" who went about whacking people,
    including the Prince, by way of brightening up the tragedy.


    I never saw my sister's Ophelia, but I know it was a fine send-off for
    her and that she must have looked lovely. Oh, what a pretty young girl
    she was! Her golden-brown eyes exactly matched her hair, and she was the
    winsomest thing imaginable! From the first she showed talent.


    From Taylor's letters I find       and, indeed, without them I could not have
    forgotten       that the good, kind friend never ceased to work in our
    interests. "I have recommended Flossy to play Lady Betty in the
    country." "I have written to the Bancrofts in favor of
    Forbes-Robertson
    for Bassanio." (Evidently this was in answer to a request from me.
    Naturally, the Bancrofts wanted someone of higher standing, but was I
    wrong about J. Forbes-Robertson? I think not!) "The mother came to see
    me the other day. I was extremely sorry to hear the bad news of
    Tom."
    (Tom was the black sheep of our family, but a fascinating wretch, all
    the same.) "I rejoice to think of your coming back," he writes another
    time, "to show the stage what an actress should be." "A thousand thanks
    for the photographs. I like the profile best. It is most Paolo Veronesish and gives the right notion of your Portia, although the color
    hardly suggests the golden gorgeousness of your dress and the blonde
    glory of the hair and complexion.... I hope you have seen the quiet
    little boxes at               's foolish article." (This refers to an article
    which attacked my Portia in Blackwood's Magazine.) "Of course, if               
    found his ideal in                he must dislike you in Portia, or in anything
    where it is a case of grace and spontaneity and Nature against
    affectation, over-emphasis, stilt, and false idealism       in short, utter
    lack of Nature. How can the same critic admire both? However, the
    public is with you, happily, as it is not always when the struggle is
    between good art and bad."


    I quote these dear letters from my friend, not in my praise, but in his.
    Until his death in 1880, he never ceased to write to me sympathetically
    and encouragingly; he rejoiced in my success the more because he had
    felt himself in part responsible for my marriage and its unhappy ending,
    and had perhaps feared that my life would suffer. Every little detail
    about me and my children, or about any of my family, was of interest to
    him. He was never too busy to give an attentive ear to my difficulties.
    "'Think of you lovingly if I can'!" he writes to me at a time when I had
    taken a course for which all blamed me, perhaps because they did not
    know enough to pardon enough       savoir tout c'est tout pardonner. "Can
    I think of you otherwise than lovingly? Never, if I know you and
    myself!"


    Tom Taylor got through an enormous amount of work. Dramatic critic and
    art critic for the Times, he was also editor of Punch and a busy
    playwright. Everyone who wanted an address written or a play altered
    came to him, and his house was a kind of Mecca for pilgrims from America
    and from all parts of the world. Yet he all the time occupied a position
    in a Government office       the Home Office, I think it was       and often
    walked from Whitehall to Lavender Sweep when his day's work was done. He
    was an enthusiastic amateur actor, his favorite part being Adam in "As
    You Like It," perhaps because tradition says this was a part that
    Shakespeare played; at any rate, he was very good in it. Gilbert and
    Sullivan, in very far-off days, used to be concerned in these amateur
    theatricals. Their names were not associated then, but Kate and I
    established a prophetic link by carrying on a mild flirtation, I with
    Arthur Sullivan, Kate with Mr. Gilbert!


    Taylor never wasted a moment. He pottered, but thought deeply all the
    time; and when I used to watch him plucking at his gray beard, I
    realized that he was just as busy as if his pen had been plucking at his
    paper. Many would-be writers complain that the necessity of earning a
    living in some other and more secure profession hinders them from
    achieving anything. What about Taylor at the Home Office, Charles Lamb
    at East India House, and Rousseau copying music for bread? It all
    depends on the point of view. A young lady in Chicago, who has written
    some charming short stories, told me how eagerly she was looking
    forward to the time when she would be able to give up teaching and
    devote herself entirely to a literary career. I wondered, and said I was
    never sure whether absolute freedom in such a matter was desirable.
    Perhaps Charles Lamb was all the better for being a slave at the desk
    for so many years.


    "Ah, but then, Charles Lamb wrote so little!" was the remarkable answer.


    Taylor did not write "so little." He wrote perhaps too much, and I think
    his heart was too strong for his brain. He was far too simple and
    lovable a being to be great. The atmosphere of gaiety which pervaded
    Lavender Sweep arose from his generous, kindly nature, which insisted
    that it was possible for everyone to have a good time.


    Once, when we were rushing to catch a train with him, Kate hanging onto
    one arm and I onto the other, we all three fell down the station steps.
    "Now, then, none of your jokes!" said a cross man behind us, who seemed
    to attribute our descent to rowdyism. Taylor stood up with his soft felt
    hat bashed over one eye, his spectacles broken, and laughed, and
    laughed, and laughed!


    Lavender Sweep was a sort of house of call for everyone of note.
    Mazzini
    stayed there some time, and Steele Mackaye, the American actor who
    played that odd version of "Hamlet" at the Crystal Palace with Polly as
    Ophelia. Perhaps a man with more acute literary conscience than Taylor
    would not have condescended to "write up" Shakespeare; perhaps a man of
    more independence and ambition would not have wasted his really fine
    accomplishment as a playwright for ever on adaptations. That was his
    weakness       if it was a weakness. He lived entirely for his age, and so
    was more prominent in it than Charles Reade, for instance, whose name,
    no doubt, will live longer.


    He put himself at the mercy of Whistler, once, in some Velasquez
    controversy of which I forget the details, but they are all set out, for
    those who like mordant ridicule, in "The Gentle Art of Making Enemies."


    When Tom Taylor criticised acting he wrote as an expert, and he often
    said illuminating things to me about actors and actresses which I could
    apply over again to some of the players with whom I have been associated
    since. "She is a curious example," he said once of an actress of great
    conscientiousness, "of how far seriousness, sincerity, and weight will
    supply the place of almost all the other qualities of an actress." When
    a famous classic actress reappeared as Rosalind, he described her
    performance as "all minute-guns and minauderies, ... a foot between
    every word, and the intensity of the emphasis entirely destroying all
    the spontaneity and flow of spirits which alone excuse and explain; ...
    as unlike Shakespeare's Rosalind, I will stake my head, as human
    personation could be!"


    There was some talk at that time (the early 'seventies) of my playing
    Rosalind at Manchester for Mr. Charles Calvert, and Tom Taylor urged me
    to do it. "Then," he said charmingly, "I can sing my stage Nunc
    Dimittis." The whole plan fell through, including a project for me to
    star as Juliet to the Romeo of a lady!


    I have already said that the Taylors' home was one of the most softening
    and culturing influences of my early life. Would that I could give an
    impression of the dear host at the head of his dinner-table, dressed in
    black silk knee-breeches and velvet cutaway coat       a survival of a
    politer time, not an affectation of it       beaming on his guests with his
    very brown eyes!


    Lavender is still associated in my mind with everything that is lovely
    and refined. My mother nearly always wore the color, and the Taylors
    lived at Lavender Sweep! This may not be an excellent reason for my
    feelings on the subject, but it is reason good enough.


    "Nature repairs her ravages," it is said, but not all. New things come
    into one's life       new loves, new joys, new interests, new friends       but
    they cannot replace the old. When Tom Taylor died, I lost a friend the
    like of whom I never had again.

          

    VI
    A YEAR WITH THE BANCROFTS


    My engagement with the Bancrofts lasted a little over a year. After
    Portia there was nothing momentous about it. I found Clara Douglas
    difficult, but I enjoyed playing her. I found Mabel Vane easy, and I
    enjoyed playing her, too, although there was less to be proud of in my
    success here. Almost anyone could have "walked in" to victory on such
    very simple womanly emotion as the part demanded. At this time friends
    who had fallen in love with Portia used to gather at the
    Prince of
    Wales's and applaud me in a manner more vigorous than judicious. It was
    their fault that it got about that I had hired a claque to clap me! Now,
    it seems funny, but at the time I was deeply hurt at the insinuation,
    and it cast a shadow over what would otherwise have been a very happy
    time.


    It is the way of the public sometimes, to keep all their enthusiasm for
    an actress who is doing well in a minor part, and to withhold it from
    the actress who is playing the leading part. I don't say for a minute
    that Mrs. Bancroft's Peg Woffington in "Masks and Faces" was not
    appreciated and applauded, but I know that my Mabel Vane was received
    with a warmth out of all proportion to the merits of my performance, and
    that this angered some of Mrs. Bancroft's admirers, and made them the
    bearers of ill-natured stories. Any unpleasantness that it caused
    between us personally was of the briefest duration. It would have been
    odd indeed if I had been jealous of her, or she of me. Apart from all
    else, I had met with my little bit of success in such a different field,
    and she was almost another Madame Vestris in popular esteem.


    When I was playing Blanche Hayes in "Ours," I nearly killed Mrs.
    Bancroft with the bayonet which it was part of the business of the play
    for me to "fool" with. I charged as usual; either she made a mistake and
    moved to the right instead of to the left, or I made a mistake.
    Anyhow, I wounded her in the arm. She had to wear it in a sling, and I
    felt very badly about it, all the more because of the ill-natured
    stories of its being no accident.


    Miss Marie Tempest is perhaps the actress of the present day who reminds
    me a little of what Mrs. Bancroft was at the Prince of Wales's, but
    neither nature nor art succeed in producing two actresses exactly alike.
    At her best Mrs. Bancroft was unapproachable. I think that the best
    thing I ever saw her do was the farewell to the boy in "Sweethearts." It
    was exquisite!


    In "Masks and Faces" Taylor and Reade had collaborated, and the exact
    share of each in the result was left to one's own discernment. I
    remember saying to Taylor one night at dinner when Reade was sitting
    opposite me, that I wished he (Taylor) would write me a part like that.
    "If only I could have an original part like Peg!"


    Charles Reade, after fixing me with his amused and very glittering
    eye, said across the table: "I have something for your private ear,
    Madam, after this repast!" And he came up with the ladies, sat by me,
    and, calling me "an artful toad"       a favorite expression of his for
    me!       told me that he, Charles Reade and no other, had written every
    line of Peg, and that I ought to have known it. I didn't know, as a
    matter of fact, but perhaps it was stupid of me. There was more of Tom
    Taylor in Mabel Vane.


    I played five parts in all at the Prince of Wales's, and I think I may
    claim that the Bancrofts found me a useful actress       ever the dull
    height of my ambition! They wanted Byron       the author of "Our Boys"       to
    write me a part in the new play, which they had ordered from him, but
    when "Wrinkles" turned up there was no part which they felt they could
    offer me, and I think Coghlan was also not included in the cast. At any
    rate, he was free to take me to see Henry Irving act. Coghlan was always
    raving about Irving at this time. He said that one evening spent in
    watching him act was the best education an actor could have. Seeing
    other people act, even if they are not Irvings, is always an education
    to us. I have never been to a theater yet without learning something. It
    must have been in the spring of 1876 that I received this note:

                   "Will you come in our box on Tuesday for
Queen Mary? Ever yours,

                  
"CHARLES T. COGHLAN.

                  
"P.S.       I am afraid that they will soon have to smooth their wrinkled front of the P. of W. Alas! Hélas! Ah, me!"


    This postscript, I think, must have referred to the approaching
    withdrawal of "Wrinkles" from the Prince of Wales's, and the return of
    Coghlan and myself to the cast.


    Meanwhile, we went to see Irving's King Philip.


    Well, I can only say that he never did anything better to the day of his
    death. Never shall I forget his expression and manner when Miss Bateman,
    as Queen Mary (she was very good, by the way), was pouring out her
    heart to him. The horrid, dead look, the cruel unresponsiveness, the
    indifference of the creature! While the poor woman protested and wept,
    he went on polishing up his ring! Then the tone in which he asked:


    "Is dinner ready?"


    It was the perfection of quiet malignity and cruelty.


    The extraordinary advance that he had made since the days when we had
    acted together at the Queen's Theater did not occur to me. I was just
    spellbound by a study in cruelty, which seemed to me a triumphant
    assertion of the power of the actor to create as well as to interpret,
    for Tennyson never suggested half what Henry Irving did.


    We talk of progress, improvement, and advance; but when I think of Henry
    Irving's Philip, I begin to wonder if Oscar Wilde was not profound as
    well as witty when he said that a great artist moves in a cycle of
    masterpieces, of which the last is no more perfect than the first. Only
    Irving's Petruchio stops me. But, then, he had not found himself. He was
    not an artist.


    "Why did Whistler paint him as Philip?" some one once asked me. How
    dangerous to "ask why" about anyone so freakish as Jimmy Whistler. But I
    answered then, and would answer now, that it was because, as Philip,
    Henry, in his dress without much color (from the common point of view),
    his long, gray legs, and Velasquez-like attitudes, looked like the kind
    of thing which Whistler loved to paint. Velasquez had painted a real
    Philip of the same race. Whistler would paint the actor who had created
    the Philip of the stage.

          

    
    

          

          

    HENRY IRVING AS PHILIP OF SPAIN

          

    From the painting by Whistler

          

    I have a note from Whistler written to Henry at a later date which
    refers to the picture, and suggests portraying him in all his
    characters. It is common knowledge that the sitter never cared much
    about the portrait. Henry had a strange affection for the wrong picture
    of himself. He disliked the Bastien Lepage, the Whistler, and the
    Sargent, which never even saw the light. He adored the weak, handsome
    picture by Millais, which I must admit, all the same, held the mirror up
    to one of the characteristics of Henry's face       its extreme refinement.
    Whistler's Philip probably seemed to him not nearly showy enough.


    Whistler I knew long before he painted the Philip. He gave me the most
    lovely dinner-set of blue and white Nanking that any woman ever
    possessed, and a set of Venetian glass, too good for a world where glass
    is broken. He sent my little girl a tiny Japanese kimono when Liberty
    was hardly a name. Many of his friends were my friends. He was with the
    dearest of those friends when he died.


    The most remarkable men I have known were, without a doubt, Whistler and
    Oscar Wilde. This does not imply that I liked them better or admired
    them more than the others, but there was something about both of them
    more instantaneously individual and audacious than it is possible to
    describe.


    When I went with Coghlan to see Henry Irving's Philip I was no stranger
    to his acting. I had been present with Tom Taylor, then dramatic critic
    of The Times, at the famous first night at the Lyceum in 1874, when
    Henry Irving put his fortune, counted not in gold, but in years of
    scorned delights and laborious days       years of constant study and
    reflection, of Spartan self-denial, and deep melancholy       I was present
    when he put it all to the touch "to win or lose it all." This is no
    exaggeration. Hamlet was by far the greatest part that he had ever
    played, or was ever to play. If he had failed       but why pursue it? He
    could not fail.


    Yet the success on the first night at the Lyceum in 1874 was not of that
    electrical, almost hysterical splendor which has greeted the momentous
    achievements of some actors. The first two acts were received with
    indifference. The people could not see how packed they were with superb
    acting       perhaps because the new Hamlet was so simple, so quiet, so free
    from the exhibition of actors' artifices which used to bring down the
    house in "Louis XI" and in "Richelieu," but which were really the easy
    things in acting, and in "Richelieu" (in my opinion) not especially well
    done. In "Hamlet" Henry Irving did not go to the audience. He made them
    come to him. Slowly but surely attention gave place to admiration,
    admiration to enthusiasm, enthusiasm to triumphant acclaim.


    I have seen many Hamlets       Fechter,
    Charles Kean, Rossi,
    Frederick Haas,
    Forbes-Robertson, and my own son, Gordon Craig, among them, but they
    were not in the same hemisphere! I refuse to go and see Hamlets now. I
    want to keep Henry Irving's fresh and clear in my memory until I die.


    When he engaged me to play Ophelia in 1878 he asked me to go down to
    Birmingham to see the play, and that night I saw what I shall always
    consider the perfection of acting. It had been wonderful in 1874. In
    1878 it was far more wonderful. It has been said that when he had the
    "advantage" of my Ophelia, his Hamlet "improved." I don't think so. He
    was always quite independent of the people with whom he acted.


    The Birmingham night he knew I was there. He played       I say it without
    vanity       for me. We players are not above that weakness, if it be a
    weakness. If ever anything inspires us to do our best it is the presence
    in the audience of some fellow-artist who must in the nature of things
    know more completely than any one what we intend, what we do, what we
    feel. The response from such a member of the audience flies across the
    footlights to us like a flame. I felt it once when I played Olivia
    before Eleonora Duse. I felt that she felt it once when she played
    Marguerite Gauthier for me.


    When I read "Hamlet" now, everything that Henry did in it seems to me
    more absolutely right, even than I thought at the time. I would give
    much to be able to record it all in detail       but it may be my
    fault       writing is not the medium in which this can be done. Sometimes I
    have thought of giving readings of "Hamlet," for I can remember every
    tone of Henry's voice, every emphasis, every shade of meaning that he
    saw in the lines and made manifest to the discerning. Yes, I think I
    could give some pale idea of what his Hamlet was if I read the play.


    "Words! words! words!" What is it to say, for instance, that the
    cardinal qualities of his Prince of Denmark were strength, delicacy,
    distinction? There was never a touch of commonness. Whatever he did or
    said, blood and breeding pervaded him.


    His "make-up" was very pale, and this made his face beautiful when one
    was close to him, but at a distance it gave him a haggard look. Some
    said he looked twice his age.


    He kept three things going at the same time       the antic madness, the
    sanity, the sense of the theater. The last was to all that he imagined
    and thought, what charity is said by St. Paul to be to all other
    virtues.


    He was never cross or moody       only melancholy. His melancholy was as
    simple as it was profound. It was touching, too, rather than defiant.
    You never thought that he was wantonly sad and enjoying his own misery.


    He neglected no coup de théâtre to assist him, but who notices the
    servants when the host is present?


    For instance, his first entrance as Hamlet was, what we call in the
    theater, very much "worked up." He was always a tremendous believer in
    processions, and rightly. It is through such means that Royalty keeps
    its hold on the feeling of the public, and makes its mark as a Figure
    and a Symbol. Henry Irving understood this. Therefore, to music so apt
    that it was not remarkable in itself, but merely a contribution to the
    general excited anticipation, the Prince of Denmark came on to the
    stage. I understood later on at the Lyceum what days of patient work had
    gone to the making of that procession.


    At its tail, when the excitement was at fever heat, came the solitary
    figure of Hamlet, looking extraordinarily tall and thin. The lights
    were turned down       another stage trick       to help the effect that the
    figure was spirit rather than man.


    He was weary       his cloak trailed on the ground. He did not wear the
    miniature of his father obtrusively round his neck! His attitude was one
    which I have seen in a common little illumination to the "Reciter,"
    compiled by Dr. Pinches (Henry Irving's old schoolmaster). Yet how right
    to have taken it, to have been indifferent to its humble origin! Nothing
    could have been better when translated into life by Irving's genius.


    The hair looked blue-black, like the plumage of a crow, the eyes
    burning       two fires veiled as yet by melancholy. But the appearance of
    the man was not single, straight or obvious, as it is when I describe
    it       any more than his passions throughout the play were. I only remember
    one moment when his intensity concentrated itself in a straightforward,
    unmistakable emotion, without side-current or back-water. It was when he
    said:


  
    
      
        
          
            
              
"The play's the thing
With which to catch the conscience of the King."

              
            
          
        
      
    
  


    and, as the curtain came down, was seen to be writing madly on his
    tablets against one of the pillars.


    "Oh, God, that I were a writer!" I paraphrase Beatrice with all my
    heart. Surely a writer could not string words together about Henry
    Irving's Hamlet and say nothing, nothing.


    "We must start this play a living thing," he used to say at rehearsals,
    and he worked until the skin grew tight over his face, until he became
    livid with fatigue, yet still beautiful, to get the opening lines said
    with individuality, suggestiveness, speed, and power.


  
     Bernardo: Who's there?


     Francisco: Nay, answer me; stand, and unfold yourself.


     Bernardo: Long live the King!


     Francisco: Bernardo?


     Bernardo: He.


     Francisco: You come most carefully upon your hour.


     Bernardo: 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.


     Francisco: For this relief much thanks; 'tis bitter cold....

  


    And all that he tried to make others do with these lines, he himself did
    with every line of his own part. Every word lived.


    Some said: "Oh, Irving only makes Hamlet a love poem!" They said that, I
    suppose, because in the Nunnery scene with Ophelia he was the lover
    above the prince and the poet. With what passionate longing his hands
    hovered over Ophelia at her words:

                   "Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind."


    His advice to the players was not advice. He did not speak it as an
    actor. Nearly all Hamlets in that scene give away the fact that they are
    actors, and not dilettanti of royal blood. Irving defined the way he
    would have the players speak as an order, an instruction of the merit
    of which he was regally sure. There was no patronizing flavor in his
    acting here, not a touch of "I'll teach you how to do it." He was
    swift       swift and simple       pausing for the right word now and again, as in
    the phrase "to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature." His slight pause
    and eloquent gesture was the all-embracing word "Nature" came in answer
    to his call, were exactly repeated unconsciously years later by the
    Queen of Roumania (Carmen Sylva). She was telling us the story of a
    play that she had written. The words rushed out swiftly, but
    occasionally she would wait for the one that expressed her meaning most
    comprehensively and exactly, and as she got it, up went her hand in
    triumph over her head. "Like yours in 'Hamlet,'" I told Henry at the
    time.


          

    
    

          

    HENRY IRVING AS HAMLET

    From the statue by E. Onslow Ford, R.A., in the Guildhall
    of the City of London

          

    I knew this Hamlet both ways       as an actress from the stage, and as an
    actress putting away her profession for the time as one of the
    audience       and both ways it was superb to me. Tennyson, I know, said it
    was not a perfect Hamlet. I wonder, then, where he hoped to find
    perfection!


    James Spedding, considered a fine critic in his day, said Irving was
    "simply hideous ... a monster!" Another of these fine critics declared
    that he never could believe in Irving's Hamlet after having seen "part
    (sic) of his performance as a murderer in a commonplace melodrama."
    Would one believe that any one could seriously write so stupidly as that
    about the earnest effort of an earnest actor, if it were not quoted by
    some of Irving's biographers?


    Some criticism, however severe, however misguided, remains within the
    bounds of justice, but what is one to think of the Quarterly Reviewer
    who declared that "the enormous pains taken with the scenery had ensured
    Mr. Irving's success"? The scenery was of the simplest       no money was
    spent on it even when the play was revived at the Lyceum after
    Colonel
    Bateman's death. Henry's dress probably cost him about £2!


    My Ophelia dress was made of material which could not have cost more
    than 2s. a yard, and not many yards were wanted, as I was at the time
    thin to vanishing point! I have the dress still, and, looking at it the
    other day, I wondered what leading lady now would consent to wear it.


    At all its best points, Henry's Hamlet was susceptible of absurd
    imitation. Think of this well, young actors, who are content to play for
    safety, to avoid ridicule at all costs, to be "natural"       oh, word most
    vilely abused! What sort of naturalness is this of Hamlet's?

"O, villain, villain, smiling damned villain!"


    Henry Irving's imitators could make people burst with laughter when they
    took off his delivery of that line. And, indeed, the original, too, was
    almost provocative of laughter       rightly so, for such emotional
    indignation has its funny as well as its terrible aspect. The mad, and
    all are mad who have, as Socrates put it, "a divine release from the
    common ways of men," may speak ludicrously, even when they speak the
    truth.


    All great acting has a certain strain of extravagance which the
    imitators catch hold of and give us the eccentric body without the
    sublime soul.


    From the first I saw this extravagance, this bizarrerie in Henry
    Irving's acting. I noticed, too, its infinite variety. In "Hamlet,"
    during the first scene with Horatio, Marcellus and Bernardo, he began by
    being very absent and distant. He exchanged greetings sweetly and
    gently, but he was the visionary. His feet might be on the ground, but
    his head was towards the stars "where the eternal are." Years later he
    said to me of another actor in "Hamlet": "He would never have seen the
    ghost." Well, there was never any doubt that Henry Irving saw it, and
    it was through his acting in the Horatio scene that he made us sure.


    As a bad actor befogs Shakespeare's meaning, so a good actor illuminates
    it. Bit by bit as Horatio talks, Hamlet comes back into the world. He is
    still out of it when he says:

"My father! Methinks I see my father."


    But the dreamer becomes attentive, sharp as a needle, with the words:
"For God's love, let me hear."


    Irving's face, as he listened to Horatio's tale, blazed with
    intelligence. He cross-examined the men with keenness and authority. His
    mental deductions as they answered were clearly shown. With "I would I
    had been there" the cloud of unseen witnesses with whom he had before
    been communing again descended. For a second or two Horatio and the rest
    did not exist for him.... So onward to the crowning couplet:


  
    
      
        
          
            
                   "... foul deeds will rise,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them to men's eyes."

            
          
        
      
    
  


    After having been very quiet and rapid, very discreet, he pronounced
    these lines in a loud, clear voice, dragged out every syllable as if
    there never could be an end to his horror and his rage.


    I had been familiar with the scene from my childhood       I had studied it;
    I had heard from my father how Macready acted in it, and now I found
    that I had a fool of an idea of it! That's the advantage of study,
    good people, who go to see Shakespeare acted. It makes you know
    sometimes what is being done, and what you never dreamed would be done
    when you read the scene at home.


    As one of the audience I was much struck by Irving's treatment of
    interjections and exclamations in "Hamlet." He breathed the line: "O,
    that this too, too solid flesh would melt," as one long yearning, and,
    "O horrible, O horrible! most horrible!" as a groan. When we first went
    to America his address at Harvard touched on this very subject, and it
    may be interesting to know that what he preached in 1885 he had
    practiced as far back as 1874.


  
                   "On the question of pronunciation, there is something to be said which I think in ordinary teaching is not sufficiently considered. Pronunciation should be simple and unaffected, but not always fashioned rigidly according to a dictionary standard. No less an authority than Cicero points out that pronunciation must vary widely according to the emotions to be expressed; that it may be broken or cut with a varying or direct sound, and that it serves for the actor the purpose of color to the painter, from which to draw variations. Take the simplest illustration. The formal pronunciation of A-h is 'Ah,' of O-h, 'Oh,' but you cannot stereotype the expression of emotion like this. These exclamations are words of one syllable, but the speaker who is sounding the gamut of human feeling will not be restricted in his pronunciation by dictionary rule. It is said of Edmund Kean that he never spoke such ejaculations, but always sighed or groaned them. Fancy an actor saying:

                  
'My Desdemona! Oh! oh! oh!'

                  
"Words are intended to express feelings and ideas, not to bind them in rigid fetters; the accents of pleasure are different from the accents of pain, and if a feeling is more accurately expressed as in nature by a variation of sound not provided by the laws of pronunciation, then such imperfect laws must be disregarded and nature vindicated!"

  


    It was of the address in which these words occur that a Boston hearer
    said that it was felt by every one present that "the truth had been
    spoken by a man who had learned it through living and not through
    theory."


    I leave his Hamlet for the present with one further reflection. It was
    in courtesy and humor that it differed most widely from other
    Hamlets that I have seen and heard of. This Hamlet was never rude to
    Polonius. His attitude towards the old Bromide (I thank you, Mr. Gelett
    Burgess, for teaching me that word which so lightly and charmingly
    describes the child of darkness and of platitude) was that of one who
    should say: "You dear, funny old simpleton, whom I have had to bear with
    all my life       how terribly in the way you seem now." With what slightly
    amused and cynical playfulness this Hamlet said: "I had thought some of
    Nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well; they imitated
    humanity so abominably."


    Hamlet was by far his greatest triumph, although he would not admit it
    himself       preferring in some moods to declare that his finest work was
    done in Macbeth, which was almost universally disliked.


    When I went with Coghlan to see Irving's Philip, this "Hamlet"
    digression may have suggested that I was not in the least surprised at
    what I saw. Being a person little given to dreaming, and always living
    wholly in the present, it did not occur to me to wonder if I should ever
    act with this marvelous man. He was not at this time lessee of the
    Lyceum       Colonel Bateman was still alive       and I looked no further than my
    engagement at the Prince of Wales's, although in a few months it was to
    come to an end.


    Although I was now earning a good salary, I still lived in lodgings at
    Camden Town, took an omnibus to and from the theater, and denied myself
    all luxuries. I did not take a house until I went to the Court Theater.
    It was then, too, that I had my first cottage       a wee place at
    Hampton
    Court where my children were very happy. They used to give performances
    of "As You Like It" for the benefit of the Palace custodians       old
    Crimean veterans, most of them       and when the children had grown up these
    old men would still ask affectionately after "little Miss Edy" and
    "Master Teddy," forgetting the passing of time.


    My little daughter was a very severe critic! I think if I had listened
    to her, I should have left the stage in despair. She saw me act for the
    first time as Mabel Vane, but no compliments were to be extracted from
    her.


    "You did look long and thin in your gray dress."


    "When you fainted I thought you was going to fall into the
    orchestra       you was so long."


    In "New Men and Old Acres" I had to play the piano while I conducted a
    conversation consisting on my side chiefly of haughty remarks to the
    effect that "blood would tell," to talk naturally and play at the same
    time. I "shied" at the lines, became self-conscious, and either sang the
    words or altered the rhythm of the tune to suit the pace of the speech.
    I grew anxious about it, and was always practicing it at home. After
    much hard work Edy used to wither me with:


    "That's not right!"


    Teddy was of a more flattering disposition, but very obstinate when he
    chose. I remember "wrastling" with him for hours over a little
    Blake
    poem which he had learned by heart, to say to his mother:


  
    
      
        
          
            
"When the voices of children are heard on the green,
       And laughing is heard on the hill,
My heart is at rest within my breast,
       And everything else is still.
Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,
       And the dews of the night arise,
Come, come, leave off play, and let us away,
       Till morning appears in the skies.

No, no, let us play, for yet it is day,
       And we cannot go to sleep.
Besides, in the sky the little birds fly,
       And the hills are all covered with sheep...."

            
          
        
      
    
  


    All went well until the last line. Then he came to a stop.

    Nothing would make him say sheep!


    With a face beaming with anxiety to please, looking adorable, he would
    offer any word but the right one.


    "And the hills are all covered with       "


    "With what, Teddy?"


    "Master Teddy don't know."


    "Something white, Teddy."


    "Snow?"


    "No, no       does snow rhyme with 'sleep'?"


    "Paper?"


    "No, no. Now, I am not going to the theater until you say the right
    word. What are the hills covered with?"


    "People."


    "Teddy, you're a very naughty boy."


    At this point he was put in the corner. His first suggestion when he
    came out was:


    "Grass? Trees?"


    "Are grass or trees white?" said the despairing mother with her eye on
    the clock, which warned her that, after all, she would have to go to the
    theater without winning.


    Meanwhile, Edy was murmuring: "Sheep, Teddy," in a loud aside, but
    Teddy would not say it, not even when both he and I burst into tears!


    At Hampton Court the two children, dressed in blue and white check
    pinafores, their hair closely cropped       the little boy fat and fair (at
    this time he bore a remarkable resemblance to Laurence's portrait of the
    youthful King of Rome), the little girl thin and dark       ran as wild as
    though the desert had been their playground instead of the gardens of
    this old palace of kings! They were always ready to show visitors (not
    so numerous then as now) the sights; prattled freely to them of "my
    mamma," who was acting in London, and showed them the new trees which
    they had assisted the gardeners to plant in the wild garden, and
    christened after my parts. A silver birch was Iolanthe, a maple Portia,
    an oak Mabel Vane. Through their kind offices many a stranger found it
    easy to follow the intricacies of the famous Maze. It was a fine life
    for them, surely, this unrestricted running to and fro in the gardens,
    with the great Palace as a civilizing influence!


    It was for their sake that I was most glad of my increasing prosperity
    in my profession. My engagement with the Bancrofts was exchanged at the
    close of the summer season of 1876 for an even more popular one with Mr.
    John Hare at the Court Theater, Sloane Square.


    I had learned a great deal at the Prince of Wales's, notably that the
    art of playing in modern plays in a tiny theater was quite different
    from the art of playing in the classics in a big theater. The methods
    for big and little theaters are alike, yet quite unlike. I had learned
    breadth in Shakespeare at the Princess's, and had had to employ it again
    in romantic plays for Charles Reade. The pit and gallery were the
    audience which we had to reach. At the Prince of Wales's I had to adopt
    a more delicate, more subtle, more intimate style. But the breadth had
    to be there just the same       as seen through the wrong end of the
    microscope. In acting one must possess great strength before one can be
    delicate in the right way. Too often weakness is mistaken for delicacy.


    Mr. Hare was one of the best stage managers that I have met during the
    whole of my long experience in the theater. He was snappy in manner,
    extremely irritable if anything went wrong, but he knew what he wanted,
    and he got it. No one has ever surpassed him in the securing of a
    perfect ensemble. He was the Meissonier among the theater artists.
    Very likely he would have failed if he had been called upon to produce
    "King John," but what better witness to his talent than that he knew his
    line and stuck to it?


    The members of his company were his, body and soul, while they were
    rehearsing. He gave them fifteen minutes for lunch, and any actor or
    actress who was foolish or unlucky enough to be a minute late, was sorry
    afterwards. Mr. Hare was peppery and irascible, and lost his temper
    easily.


    Personally, I always got on well with my new manager, and I ought to be
    grateful to him, if only because he gave me the second great opportunity
    of my career       the part of Olivia in Wills's play from "The Vicar of
    Wakefield." During this engagement at the Court I married again. I had
    met Charles Wardell, whose stage name was Kelly, when he was acting in
    "Rachael the Reaper" for Charles Reade. At the Court we played together
    in several pieces. He had not been bred an actor, but a soldier. He was
    in the 66th Regiment, and had fought in the Crimean War; been wounded,
    too       no carpet knight. His father was a clergyman, vicar of Winlaton,
    Northumberland       a charming type of the old-fashioned parson, a
    friendship with Sir Walter Scott in the background, and many little
    possessions of the great Sir Walter's in the foreground to remind one of
    what had been.


    Charlie Kelly, owing to his lack of training, had to be very carefully
    suited with a part before he shone as an actor. But when he was
    suited       his line was the bluff, hearty, kindly, soldier-like
    Englishman       he was better than many people who had twenty years' start
    of him in experience. This is absurdly faint praise. In such parts as
    Mr. Brown in "New Men and Old Acres," the farmer father in "Dora,"
    Diogenes in "Iris," no one could have bettered him. His most ambitious
    attempt was Benedick, which he played with me when I first appeared as
    Beatrice at Leeds. It was in many respects a splendid performance, and
    perhaps better for the play than the more polished, thoughtful, and
    deliberate Benedick of Henry Irving.


    Physically a manly, bulldog sort of a man, Charles Kelly possessed as an
    actor great tenderness and humor. It was foolish of him to refuse the
    part of Burchell in "Olivia," in which he would have made a success
    equal to that achieved by Terriss as the Squire. But he was piqued at
    not being cast for the Vicar, which he could not have played well, and
    stubbornly refused to play Burchell.


    Alas! many actors are just as blind to their true interests.


    We were married in 1876; and after I left the Court Theater for the
    Lyceum, we continued to tour together in the provinces during vacation
    time when the Lyceum was closed. These tours were very successful, but I
    never worked harder in my life! When we played "Dora" at Liverpool,
    Charles Reade, who had adapted the play from Tennyson's poem, wrote:


  
                   "Nincompoop!

                  
"What have you to fear from me for such a masterly performance! Be assured nobody can appreciate your value and Mr. Kelley's as I do. It is well played all round."


  


    VII
    EARLY DAYS AT THE LYCEUM


    It is humiliating to me to confess that I have not the faintest
    recollection of "Brothers," the play by
    Coghlan, in which I see by the
    evidence of an old play-bill that I made my first appearance under Mr.
    Hare's management. I remember another play by Coghlan, in which
    Henry Kemble made one of his early appearances in the part of a butler, and
    how funny he was, even in those days, in a struggle to get rid of a pet
    monkey       a "property" monkey made of brown wool with no "devil" in it,
    except that supplied by the comedian's imagination. We trusted to our
    acting, not to real monkeys and real dogs to bring us through, and when
    the acting was Henry Kemble's, it was good enough to rely upon!


    Charles Coghlan seems to have been consistently unlucky. Yet he was a
    good actor and a brilliant man. I always enjoyed his companionship;
    found him a pleasant, natural fellow, absorbed in his work, and not at
    all the "dangerous" man that some people represented him.


    Within less than a month from the date of the production of "Brothers,"
    "New Men and Old Acres" was put into the Court bill. It was not a new
    play, but the public at once began to crowd to see it, and I have heard
    that it brought Mr. Hare £30,000. My part, Lilian Vavasour, had been
    played in the original production by Mrs. Kendal, but it had been
    written for me by Tom Taylor when I was at the Haymarket, and it suited
    me very well. The revival was well acted all round. Charles Kelly was
    splendid as Mr. Brown, and Mr. Hare played a small part perfectly.


    H.B. Conway, a young actor whose good looks were talked of everywhere,
    was also in the cast. He was a descendant of Lord Byron's, and had a
    look of the handsomest portraits of the poet. With his bright hair
    curling tightly all over his well-shaped head, his beautiful figure, and
    charming presence, Conway created a sensation in the 'eighties almost
    equal to that made by the more famous beauty, Lillie Langtry.


    As an actor he belonged to the Terriss type, but he was not nearly as
    good as Terriss. Of his extraordinary failure in the Lyceum "Faust" I
    shall say something when I come to the Lyceum productions.


    After "New Men and Old Acres," Mr. Hare tried a posthumous play by Lord
    Lytton       "The House of Darnley." It was not a good play, and I was
    not good in it, although the pleasant adulation of some of my friends
    has made me out so. The play met with some success, and during its run
    Mr. Hare commissioned Wills to write "Olivia."


    I had known Wills before this through the Forbes-Robertsons. He was at
    one time engaged to one of the girls, but it was a good thing it ended
    in smoke. With all his charm, Wills was not cut out for a husband. He
    was Irish all over       the strangest mixture of the aristocrat and the
    sloven. He could eat a large raw onion every night like any peasant, yet
    his ideas were magnificent and instinct with refinement.


    A true Bohemian in money matters, he made a great deal out of his
    plays       and never had a farthing to bless himself with!


    In the theater he was charming       from an actor's point of view. He
    interfered very little with the stage management, and did not care to
    sit in the stalls and criticise. But he would come quietly to me and
    tell me things which were most illuminating, and he paid me the
    compliment of weeping at the wing while I rehearsed "Olivia."


    I was generally weeping, too, for Olivia, more than any part, touched
    me to the heart. I cried too much in it, just as I cried too much later
    on in the Nunnery scene in "Hamlet," and in the last act of "Charles I."
    My real tears on the stage have astonished some people, and have been
    the envy of others, but they have often been a hindrance to me. I have
    had to work to restrain them.


    Oddly enough, although "Olivia" was such a great success at the Court,
    it has never made much money since. The play could pack a tiny theater;
    it could never appeal in a big way to the masses. In itself it had a
    sure message       the love story of an injured woman is one of the cards in
    the stage pack which it is always safe to play       but against this there
    was a bad last act, one of the worst I have ever acted in. It was always
    being tinkered with, but patching and alteration only seems to weaken
    it.


    Mr. Hare produced "Olivia" perfectly. Marcus Stone designed the clothes,
    and I found my dresses       both faithful and charming as reproductions of
    the eighteenth century spirit       stood the advance of time and the
    progress of ideas when I played the part later at the Lyceum. I had not
    to alter anything. Henry Irving discovered the same thing about the
    scenery and stage management. They could not be improved upon. There was
    very little scenery at the Court, but a great deal of taste and care in
    selection.


    Every one was "Olivia" mad. The Olivia cap shared public favor with the
    Langtry bonnet. That most lovely and exquisite creature, Mrs. Langtry,
    could not go out anywhere, at the dawn of the 'eighties, without a crowd
    collecting to look at her! It was no rare thing to see the crowd, to ask
    its cause, to receive the answer, "Mrs. Langtry!" and to look in vain
    for the object of the crowd's admiring curiosity.

          

    
    

          

    LILLIE LANGTRY

    Photograph by the Vander Weyde Light

          

    This was all the more remarkable, and honorable to public taste, too,
    because Mrs. Langtry's was not a showy beauty. Her hair was the color
    that it had pleased God to make it; her complexion was her own; in
    evening dress she did not display nearly as much of her neck and arms as
    was the vogue, yet they outshone all other necks and arms through their
    own perfection.


    "No worker has a right to criticise publicly the work of another in
    the same field," Henry Irving once said to me, and Heaven forbid that I
    should disregard advice so wise! I am aware that the professional
    critics and the public did not transfer to Mrs. Langtry the actress the
    homage that they had paid to Mrs. Langtry the beauty, but I can only
    speak of the simplicity with which she approached her work, of her
    industry, and utter lack of vanity about her powers. When she played
    Rosalind (which my daughter, the best critic of acting I know, tells
    me was in many respects admirable), she wrote to me:

                   "Dear Nellie,       

                  
"I bundled through my part somehow last night, a disgraceful performance, and no waist-padding! Oh, what an impudent wretch you must think me to attempt such a part! I pinched my arm once or twice last night to see if it was really me. It was so sweet of you to write me such a nice letter, and then a telegram, too!

                  
"Yours ever, dear Nell,

                  
"LILLIE.

                  
"P.S.       I am rehearsing, all day       'The Honeymoon' next week. I love the hard work, and the thinking and study."


    Just at this time there was a great dearth on the stage of people with
    lovely diction, and Lillie Langtry had it. I can imagine that she spoke
    Rosalind's lines beautifully, and that her clear gray eyes and frank
    manner, too well-bred to be hoydenish, must have been of great value.


    To go back to "Olivia." Like all Hare's plays, it was perfectly cast.
    Where all were good, it will be admitted, I think, by every one who saw
    the production, that Terriss was the best. "As you stand there, whipping
    your boot, you look the very picture of vain indifference," Olivia says
    to Squire Thornhill in the first act, and never did I say it without
    thinking how absolutely to the life Terriss realized that description!


          

    
    

          

    WILLIAM TERRISS AS SQUIRE THORNHILL
    IN       OLIVIA      

          

    As I look back, I remember no figure in the theater more remarkable than
    Terriss. He was one of those heaven-born actors who, like kings by
    divine right, can, up to a certain point, do no wrong. Very often, like
    Dr. Johnson's "inspired idiot," Mrs. Pritchard, he did not know what he
    was talking about. Yet he "got there," while many cleverer men stayed
    behind. He had unbounded impudence, yet so much charm that no one could
    ever be angry with him. Sometimes he reminded me of a butcher-boy
    flashing past, whistling, on the high seat of his cart, or of Phaethon
    driving the chariot of the sun       pretty much the same thing, I imagine!
    When he was "dressed up" Terriss was spoiled by fine feathers; when he
    was in rough clothes, he looked a prince.


    He always commanded the love of his intimates as well as that of the
    outside public. To the end he was "Sailor Bill"       a sort of grown-up
    midshipmite, whose weaknesses provoked no more condemnation than the
    weaknesses of a child. In the theater he had the tidy habits of a
    sailor. He folded up his clothes and kept them in beautiful condition;
    and of a young man who had proposed for his daughter's hand he said:
    "The man's a blackguard! Why, he throws his things all over the room!
    The most untidy chap I ever saw!"


    Terriss had had every sort of adventure by land and sea before I acted
    with him at the Court. He had been midshipman, tea-planter, engineer,
    sheep-farmer, and horse-breeder. He had, to use his own words,
    "hobnobbed with every kind of queer folk, and found myself in extremely
    queer predicaments." The adventurous, dare-devil spirit of the roamer,
    the incarnate gipsy, always looked out of his insolent eyes. Yet,
    audacious as he seemed, no man was ever more nervous on the stage. On a
    first night he was shaking all over with fright, in spite of his
    confident and dashing appearance.


    His bluff was colossal. Once when he was a little boy and wanted money,
    he said to his mother: "Give me £5 or I'll jump out of the window." And
    she at once believed he meant it, and cried out: "Come back, come back!
    and I'll give you anything."


    He showed the same sort of "attack" with audiences. He made them
    believe in him the moment he stepped on to the stage.


    His conversation was extremely entertaining       and, let me add, ingenuous.
    One of his favorite reflections was: "Tempus fugit! So make the most of
    it. While you're alive, gather roses; for when you're dead, you're dead
    a d              d long time."


    He was a perfect rider, and loved to do cowboy "stunts" in Richmond Park
    while riding to the "Star and Garter."


    When he had presents from the front, which happened every night, he gave
    them at once to the call-boy or the gas-man. To the women-folk,
    especially the plainer ones, he was always delightful. Never was any man
    more adored by the theater staff. And children, my own Edy included,
    were simply daft about him. A little American girl, daughter of
    William Winter, the famous critic, when staying with me in England,
    announced gravely when we were out driving:


    "I've gone a mash on Terriss."


    There was much laughter. When it had subsided, the child said gravely:


    "Oh, you can laugh, but it's true. I wish I was hammered to him!"


    Perhaps if he had lived longer, Terriss would have lost his throne. He
    died as a beautiful youth, a kind of Adonis, although he was fifty years
    old when he was stabbed at the stage-door of the Adelphi Theater.


    Terriss had a beautiful mouth. That predisposed me in his favor at once!
    I have always been "cracked" on pretty mouths! I remember that I used to
    say "Naughty Teddy!" to my own little boy just for the pleasure of
    seeing him put out his under-lip, when his mouth looked lovely!


    At the Court Terriss was still under thirty, but doing the best work of
    his life. He never did anything finer than Squire Thornhill, although
    he was clever as Henry VIII. His gravity as Flutter in "The Belle's
    Stratagem" was very fetching; as Bucklaw in "Ravenswood" he looked
    magnificent, and, of course, as the sailor hero in Adelphi melodrama he
    was as good as could be. But it is as Thornhill that I like best to
    remember him. He was precisely the handsome, reckless, unworthy creature
    that good women are fools enough to love.


    In the Court production of "Olivia," both my children walked on to the
    stage for the first time. Teddy had such red cheeks that they made all
    the rouged cheeks look quite pale! Little Edy gave me a bunch of real
    flowers that she had picked in the country the day before.


    Young Norman Forbes-Robertson was the Moses of the original cast. He
    played the part again at the Lyceum. How charming he was! And how very,
    very young! He at once gave promise of being a good actor and of having
    done the right thing in following his brother on to the stage. At the
    present day I consider him the only actor on the stage who can play
    Shakespeare's fools as they should be played.


    Among the girls "walking on" was Kate Rorke. This made me take a special
    interest in watching what she did later on. No one who saw her fine
    performance in "The Profligate" could easily forget it, and I shall
    never understand why the London public ever let her go.


    It was during the run of "Olivia" that Henry Irving became sole lessee
    of the Lyceum Theater. For a long time he had been contemplating the
    step, but it was one of such magnitude that it could not be done in a
    hurry. I daresay he found it difficult to separate from
    Mrs. Bateman and
    from her daughter, who had for such a long time been his "leading lady."
    He had to be a little cruel, not for the last time, in a career devoted
    unremittingly and unrelentingly to his art and his ambition.


    It was said by an idle tongue in later years that rich ladies financed
    Henry Irving's ventures. The only shadow of foundation for this
    statement is that at the beginning of his tenancy of the Lyceum, the
    Baroness Burdett-Coutts lent him a certain sum of money, every farthing
    of which was repaid during the first few months of his management.


    The first letter that I ever received from Henry Irving was written on
    July 20, 1878, from 15A, Grafton Street, the house in which he lived
    during the entire period of his Lyceum management.

                   "Dear Miss Terry,       

                  
"I look forward to the pleasure of calling upon you on Tuesday next at two o'clock.

                  
"With every good wish, believe me, sincerely,

                  
"HENRY IRVING."


    The call was in reference to my engagement as Ophelia. Strangely
    characteristic I see it now to have been of Henry that he was content to
    take my powers as an actress more or less on trust. A mutual friend,
    Lady Pollock, had told him that I was the very person for him; that "all
    London" was talking of my Olivia; that I had acted well in Shakespeare
    with the Bancrofts; that I should bring to the Lyceum Theater what
    players call "a personal following." Henry chose his friends as
    carefully as he chose his company and his staff. He believed in Lady
    Pollock implicitly, and he did not       it is possible that he could
    not       come and see my Olivia for himself.


    I was living in Longridge Road when Henry Irving first came to see me.


    Not a word of our conversation about the engagement can I remember. I
    did notice, however, the great change that had taken place in the man
    since I had last met him in 1867. Then he was really almost ordinary
    looking       with a mustache, an unwrinkled face, and a sloping forehead.
    The only wonderful thing about him was his melancholy. When I was
    playing the piano once in the greenroom at the Queen's Theater, he came
    in and listened. I remember being made aware of his presence by his
    sigh       the deepest, profoundest, sincerest sigh I ever heard from any
    human being. He asked me if I would not play the piece again.


    The incident impressed itself on my mind, inseparably associated with a
    picture of him as he looked at thirty       a picture by no means pleasing.
    He looked conceited, and almost savagely proud of the isolation in which
    he lived. There was a touch of exaggeration in his appearance       a dash of
    Werther, with a few flourishes of Jingle! Nervously sensitive to
    ridicule, self-conscious, suffering deeply from his inability to express
    himself through his art, Henry Irving, in 1867, was a very different
    person from the Henry Irving who called on me at Longridge Road in 1878.


    In ten years he had found himself, and so lost himself       lost, I mean,
    much of that stiff, ugly, self-consciousness which had encased him as
    the shell encases the lobster. His forehead had become more massive, and
    the very outline of his features had altered. He was a man of the world,
    whose strenuous fighting now was to be done as a general       not, as
    hitherto, in the ranks. His manner was very quiet and gentle. "In
    quietness and confidence shall be your strength," says the Psalmist.
    That was always like Henry Irving.


    And here, perhaps, is the place to say that I, of all people, can
    perhaps appreciate Henry Irving least justly, although I was his
    associate on the stage for a quarter of a century, and was on the terms
    of the closest friendship with him for almost as long a time. He had
    precisely the qualities that I never find likable.


    He was an egotist       an egotist of the great type, never "a mean
    egotist," as he was once slanderously described       and all his faults
    sprang from egotism, which is in one sense, after all, only another name
    for greatness. So much absorbed was he in his own achievements that he
    was unable or unwilling to appreciate the achievements of others. I
    never heard him speak in high terms of the great foreign actors and
    actresses who from time to time visited England. It would be easy to
    attribute this to jealousy, but the easy explanation is not the true
    one. He simply would not give himself up to appreciation. Perhaps
    appreciation is a wasting though a generous quality of the mind and
    heart, and best left to lookers-on, who have plenty of time to develop
    it.


    I was with him when he saw Sarah Bernhardt act for the first time. The
    play was "Ruy Blas," and it was one of Sarah's bad days. She was
    walking through the part listlessly, and I was angry that there should
    be any ground for Henry's indifference. The same thing happened years
    later, when I took him to see Eleonora Duse. The play was "La
    Locandiera," in which to my mind she is not at her very best. He was
    surprised at my enthusiasm. There was an element of justice in his
    attitude towards the performance which infuriated me, but I doubt if he
    would have shown more enthusiasm if he had seen her at her very best.


    As the years went on he grew very much attached to Sarah Bernhardt, and
    admired her as a colleague whose managerial work in the theater was as
    dignified as his own, but of her superb powers as an actress, I don't
    believe he ever had a glimmering notion!


    Perhaps it is not true, but, as I believe it to be true, I may as well
    state it: It was never any pleasure to him to see the acting of other
    actors and actresses. All the same, Salvini's Othello I know he thought
    magnificent, but he would not speak of it.


    How dangerous it is to write things that may not be understood! What I
    have written I have written merely to indicate the qualities in Henry
    Irving's nature, which were unintelligible to me, perhaps because I have
    always been more woman than artist. He always put the theater first. He
    lived in it, he died in it. He had none of what I may call my
    bourgeois qualities       the love of being in love, the love of a home,
    the dislike of solitude. I have always thought it hard to find my
    inferiors. He was sure of his high place. He was far simpler than I in
    some ways. He would talk, for instance, in such an ingenuous way to
    painters and musicians that I blushed for him. But I know now that my
    blush was far more unworthy than his freedom from all pretentiousness in
    matters of art.


    He never pretended. One of his biographers has said that he posed as
    being a French scholar. Such a thing, and all things like it, were
    impossible to his nature. If it were necessary in one of his plays to
    say a few French words, he took infinite pains to learn them and said
    them beautifully.


    Henry once told me that in the early part of his career, before I knew
    him, he had been hooted because of his thin legs. The first service I
    did him was to tell him they were beautiful, and to make him give up
    padding them.


    "What do you want with fat, podgy, prize-fighter legs!" I expostulated.


    Praise to some people at certain stages of their career is more
    developing than blame. I admired the very things in Henry for which
    other people criticized him. I hope this helped him a little.


    I brought help, too, in pictorial matters. Henry Irving had had little
    training in such matters       I had had a great deal. Judgment about colors,
    clothes and lighting must be trained. I had learned from
    Mr. Watts,
    from Mr. Godwin, and from other artists, until a sense of decorative
    effect had become second nature to me.


    Before the rehearsals of "Hamlet" began at the Lyceum I went on a
    provincial tour with Charles Kelly, and played for the first time in
    "Dora," and "Iris," besides doing a steady round of old parts. In
    Birmingham I went to see Henry's Hamlet. (I have tried already, most
    inadequately, to say what it was to me.) I had also appeared for the
    first time as Lady Teazle       a part which I wish I was not too old to play
    now, for I could play it better. My performance in 1877 was not finished
    enough, not light enough. I think I did the screen scene well. When the
    screen was knocked over I did not stand still and rigid with eyes cast
    down. That seemed to me an attitude of guilt. Only a guilty woman,
    surely, in such a situation would assume an air of conscious virtue. I
    shrank back, and tried to hide my face       a natural movement, so it seemed
    to me, for a woman who had been craning forward, listening in increasing
    agitation to the conversation between Charles and Joseph Surface.


    I shall always regret that we never did "The School for Scandal," or any
    of the other classic comedies, at the Lyceum. There came a time when
    Henry was anxious for me to play Lady Teazle, but I opposed him, as I
    thought that I was too old. It should have been one of my best parts.


    "Star" performances, for the benefit of veteran actors retiring from the
    stage, were as common in my youth as now. About this time I played in
    "Money" for the benefit of Henry Compton, a fine comedian who had
    delighted audiences at the Haymarket for many years. On this occasion I
    did not play Clara Douglas as I had done during the revival at the
    Prince of Wales's, but the comedy part, Georgina Vesey. John Hare, Mr.
    and Mrs. Kendal, Henry Neville, Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft, and, last but not
    least, Benjamin Webster, who came out of his retirement to play
    Graves       "his original part"       were in the cast.


    I don't think that Webster ever appeared on the stage again, although
    he lived on for many years in an old-fashioned house near Kennington
    Church, and died at a great age. He has a descendant on the stage in Mr.
    Ben Webster, who acted with us at the Lyceum, and is now well known both
    in England and America.


    Henry Compton's son, Edward, was in this performance of "Money." He was
    engaged to the beautiful Adelaide Neilson, an actress whose brilliant
    career was cut off suddenly when she was riding in the Bois. She drank a
    glass of milk when she was overheated, was taken ill, and died. I am
    told that she commanded £700 a week in America, and in England people
    went wild over her Juliet. She looked like a child of the warm South,
    although she was born, I think, in Manchester, and her looks were much
    in her favor as Juliet. She belonged to the ripe, luscious, pomegranate
    type of woman. The only living actress with the same kind of beauty is
    Maxine Elliott.


    Adelaide Neilson had a short reign, but a most triumphant one. It was
    easy to understand it when one saw her. She was so gracious, so
    feminine, so lovely. She did things well, but more from instinct than
    anything else. She had no science. Edward Compton now takes his own
    company round the provinces in an excellent répertoire of old comedies.
    He has done as much to make country audiences familiar with them as
    Mr.
    Benson has done to make them familiar with Shakespeare.


    I come now to the Lyceum rehearsals of November, 1878. Although Henry
    Irving had played Hamlet for over two hundred nights in London, and for
    I don't know how many nights in the provinces, he always rehearsed in
    cloak and rapier. This careful attention to detail came back to my mind
    years afterwards, when he gave readings of Macbeth. He never gave a
    public reading without first going through the entire play at home       at
    home, that is to say, in a miserably uncomfortable hotel.


    During the first rehearsal he read every one's part except mine, which
    he skipped, and the power that he put into each part was extraordinary.
    He threw himself so thoroughly into it that his skin contracted and his
    eyes shone. His lips grew whiter and whiter, and his skin more and more
    drawn as the time went on, until he looked like a livid thing, but
    beautiful.


    He never got at anything easily, and often I felt angry that he would
    waste so much of his strength in trying to teach people to do things in
    the right way. Very often it only ended in his producing actors who gave
    colorless, feeble and unintelligent imitations of him. There were
    exceptions, of course.


    When it came to the last ten days before the date named for the
    production of "Hamlet," and my scenes with him were still unrehearsed, I
    grew very anxious and miserable. I was still a stranger in the theater,
    and in awe of Henry Irving personally; but I plucked up courage, and
    said:


    "I am very nervous about my first appearance with you. Couldn't we
    rehearse our scenes?"


    "We shall be all right!" he answered, "but we are not going to run the
    risk of being bottled up by a gas-man or a fiddler."


    When I spoke, I think he was conducting a band rehearsal. Although he
    did not understand a note of music, he felt, through intuition, what the
    music ought to be, and would pull it about and have alterations made. No
    one was cleverer than Hamilton Clarke, Henry's first musical director,
    and a most gifted composer, at carrying out his instructions. Hamilton
    Clarke often grew angry and flung out of the theater, saying that it was
    quite impossible to do what Mr. Irving required.


    "Patch it together, indeed!" he used to say to me indignantly, when I
    was told off to smooth him down. "Mr. Irving knows nothing about music,
    or he couldn't ask me to do such a thing."


    But the next day he would return with the score altered on the lines
    suggested by Henry, and would confess that the music was improved. "Upon
    my soul, it's better! The 'Guv'nor' was perfectly right."


    His Danish march in "Hamlet," his Brocken music in "Faust," and his
    music for "The Merchant of Venice" were all, to my mind, exactly
    right. The brilliant gifts of Clarke, before many years had passed,
    "o'er-leaped" themselves, and he ended his days in a lunatic asylum.


    The only person who did not profit by Henry's ceaseless labors was poor
    Ophelia. When the first night came, I did not play the part well,
    although the critics and the public were pleased. To myself I failed.
    I had not rehearsed enough. I can remember one occasion when I played
    Ophelia really well. It was in Chicago some ten years later. At Drury
    Lane, in 1896, when I played the mad scene for Nelly
    Farren's benefit,
    and took farewell of the part for ever, I was just damnable!

          

    
    

          

    ELLEN TERRY AS OPHELIA

    From a photograph taken in 1878, in the collection of Miss Evelyn Smalley

          

    Ophelia only pervades the scenes in which she is concerned until the
    mad scene. This was a tremendous thing for me, who am not capable of
    sustained effort, but can perhaps manage a cumulative effort better
    than most actresses. I have been told that Ophelia has "nothing to do"
    at first. I found so much to do! Little bits of business which, slight
    in themselves, contributed to a definite result, and kept me always in
    the picture.


    Like all Ophelias before (and after) me, I went to the madhouse to study
    wits astray. I was disheartened at first. There was no beauty, no
    nature, no pity in most of the lunatics. Strange as it may sound, they
    were too theatrical to teach me anything. Then, just as I was going
    away, I noticed a young girl gazing at the wall. I went between her and
    the wall to see her face. It was quite vacant, but the body expressed
    that she was waiting, waiting. Suddenly she threw up her hands and sped
    across the room like a swallow. I never forgot it. She was very thin,
    very pathetic, very young, and the movement was as poignant as it was
    beautiful.


    I saw another woman laugh with a face that had no gleam of laughter
    anywhere       a face of pathetic and resigned grief.


    My experiences convinced me that the actor must imagine first and
    observe afterwards. It is no good observing life and bringing the result
    to the stage without selection, without a definite idea. The idea must
    come first, the realism afterwards.


    Perhaps because I was nervous and irritable about my own part from
    insufficient rehearsal, perhaps because his responsibility as lessee
    weighed upon him, Henry Irving's Hamlet on the first night at the Lyceum
    seemed to me less wonderful than it had been at Birmingham. At
    rehearsals he had been the perfection of grace. On the night itself, he
    dragged his leg and seemed stiff from self-consciousness. He asked me
    later on if I thought the ill-natured criticism of his walk was in any
    way justified, and if he really said "Gud" for "God," and the rest of
    it. I said straight out that he did say his vowels in a peculiar way,
    and that he did drag his leg.


    I begged him to give up that dreadful, paralyzing waiting at the side
    for his cue, and after a time he took my advice. He was never obstinate
    in such matters. His one object was to find out, to test suggestion,
    and follow it if it stood his test.


    He was very diplomatic when he meant to have his own way. He never
    blustered or enforced or threatened. My first acquaintance with this
    side of him was made over my dresser for Ophelia. He had heard that I
    intended to wear black in the mad scene, and he intended me to wear
    white. When he first mentioned the subject, I had no idea that there
    would be any opposition. He spoke of my dresses, and I told him that as
    I was very anxious not to be worried about them at the last minute, they
    had been got on with early and were now finished.


    "Finished! That's very interesting! Very interesting. And what       er       what
    colors are they?"


    "In the first scene I wear a pinkish dress. It's all rose-colored with
    her. Her father and brother love her. The Prince loves her       and so she
    wears pink."


    "Pink," repeated Henry thoughtfully.


    "In the nunnery scene I have a pale, gold, amber dress       the most
    beautiful color. The material is a church brocade. It will 'tone down'
    the color of my hair. In the last scene I wear a transparent, black
    dress."


    Henry did not wag an eyelid.


    "I see. In mourning for her father."


    "No, not exactly that. I think red was the mourning color of the
    period. But black seems to me right       like the character, like the
    situation."


    "Would you put the dresses on?" said Henry gravely.


    At that minute Walter Lacy came up, that very Walter Lacy who had been
    with Charles Kean when I was a child, and who now acted as adviser to
    Henry Irving in his Shakespearean productions.


    "Ah, here's Lacy. Would you mind, Miss Terry, telling Mr. Lacy what you
    are going to wear?"


    Rather surprised, but still unsuspecting, I told Lacy all over again.
    Pink in the first scene, yellow in the second, black       


    You should have seen Lacy's face at the word "black." He was going to
    burst out, but Henry stopped him. He was more diplomatic than that!


    "They generally wear white, don't they?"


    "I believe so," I answered, "but black is more interesting."


    "I should have thought you would look much better in white."


    "Oh, no!" I said.


    And then they dropped the subject for that day. It was clever of him!


    The next day Lacy came up to me:


    "You didn't really mean that you are going to wear black in the mad
    scene?"


    "Yes, I did. Why not?"


    "Why not! My God! Madam, there must be only one black figure in this
    play, and that's Hamlet!"


    I did feel a fool. What a blundering donkey I had been not to see it
    before! I was very thrifty in those days, and the thought of having been
    the cause of needless expense worried me. So instead of the crêpe de
    Chine and miniver, which had been used for the black dress, I had for
    the white dress Bolton sheeting and rabbit, and I believe it looked
    better.


    The incident, whether Henry was right or not, led me to see that,
    although I knew more of art and archaeology in dress than he did, he had
    a finer sense of what was right for the scene. After this he always
    consulted me about the costumes, but if he said: "I want such and such a
    scene to be kept dark and mysterious," I knew better than to try and
    introduce pale-colored dresses into it.


    Henry always had a fondness for "the old actor," and would engage him in
    preference to the tyro any day. "I can trust them," he explained
    briefly.


    In the cast of "Hamlet" Mr. Forrester, Mr. Chippendale, and
    Tom Mead
    worthily repaid the trust. Mead, in spite of a terrible excellence in
    "Meadisms"       he substituted the most excruciatingly funny words for
    Shakespeare's when his memory of the text failed       was a remarkable
    actor. His voice as the Ghost was beautiful, and his appearance
    splendid. With his deep-set eyes, hawklike nose, and clear brow, he
    reminded me of the Rameses head in the British Museum.


    We had young men in the cast, too. There was one very studious youth who
    could never be caught loafing. He was always reading, or busy in the
    greenroom studying by turns the pictures of past actor-humanity with
    which the walls were peopled, or the present realities of actors who
    came in and out of the room. Although he was so much younger then,
    Mr. Pinero looked much as he does now. He played Rosencrantz very neatly.
    Consummate care, precision, and brains characterized his work as an
    actor always, but his chief ambition lay another way. Rosencrantz and
    the rest were his school of stage-craft.


    Kyrle Bellew, the Osric of the production, was another man of the
    future, though we did not know it. He was very handsome, a tremendous
    lady-killer! He wore his hair rather long, had a graceful figure, and a
    good voice, as became the son of a preacher who had the reputation of
    saying the Lord's Prayer so dramatically that his congregation sobbed.


    Frank Cooper, a descendant of the Kembles, another actor who has risen
    to eminence since, played Laertes. It was he who first led me onto the
    Lyceum stage. Twenty years later he became my leading man on the first
    tour I took independently of Henry Irving since my tours with my
    husband, Charles Kelly.


    VIII
    WORK AT THE LYCEUM


    When I am asked what I remember about the first ten years at the Lyceum,
    I can answer in one word: Work. I was hardly ever out of the theater.
    What with acting, rehearsing, and studying       twenty-five reference books
    were a "simple coming-in" for one part       I sometimes thought I should go
    blind and mad. It was not only for my parts at the Lyceum that I had to
    rehearse. From August to October I was still touring in the provinces on
    my own account. My brother George acted as my business manager. His
    enthusiasm was not greater than his loyalty and industry. When we were
    playing in small towns he used to rush into my dressing-room after the
    curtain was up and say excitedly:


    "We've got twenty-five more people in our gallery than the Blank Theater
    opposite!"


    Although he was very delicate, he worked for me like a slave. When my
    tours with Mr. Kelly ended in 1880 and I promised Henry Irving that in
    future I would go to the provincial towns with him, my brother was given
    a position at the Lyceum, where, I fear, his scrupulous and
    uncompromising honesty often got him into trouble. "Perks," as they are
    called in domestic service, are one of the heaviest additions to a
    manager's working expenses, and George tried to fight the system. He
    hurt no one so much as himself.


    One of my productions in the provinces was an English version of
    "Frou-Frou," made for me by my dear friend Mrs. Comyns Carr, who for
    many years designed the dresses that I wore in different Lyceum plays.
    "Butterfly," as "Frou-Frou" was called when it was produced in English,
    went well; indeed, the Scots of Edinburgh received it with overwhelming
    favor, and it served my purpose at the time, but when I saw
    Sarah
    Bernhardt play the part I wondered that I had had the presumption to
    meddle with it. It was not a case of my having a different view of the
    character and playing it according to my imagination, as it was, for
    instance, when Duse played "La Dame aux Camélias," and gave a
    performance that one could not say was inferior to Bernhardt's,
    although it was so utterly different. No people in their right senses
    could have accepted my "Frou-Frou" instead of Sarah's. What I lacked
    technically in it was pace.


    Of course, it is partly the language. English cannot be phrased as
    rapidly as French. But I have heard foreign actors, playing in the
    English tongue, show us this rapidity, this warmth, this fury       call it
    what you will       and have just wondered why we are, most of us, so
    deficient in it.


    Fechter had it, so had Edwin Forrest. When strongly moved, their
    passions and their fervor made them swift. The more Henry Irving felt,
    the more deliberate he became. I said to him once: "You seem to be
    hampered in the vehemence of passion." "I am," he answered. This is
    what crippled his Othello, and made his scene with Tubal in "The
    Merchant of Venice" the least successful to him. What it was to the
    audience is another matter. But he had to take refuge in speechless rage
    when he would have liked to pour out his words like a torrent.


    In the company which Charles Kelly and I took round the provinces in
    1880 were Henry Kemble and Charles Brookfield. Young Brookfield was just
    beginning life as an actor, and he was so brilliantly funny off the
    stage that he was always a little disappointing on it. My old
    manageress, Mrs. Wigan, first brought him to my notice, writing in a
    charming little note that she knew him "to have a power of personation
    very rare in an unpracticed actor," and that if we could give him varied
    practice, she would feel it a courtesy to her.


    I had reason to admire Mr. Brookfield's "powers of personation" when I
    was acting at Buxton. He and Kemble had no parts in one of our plays, so
    they amused themselves during their "off" night by hiring bath-chairs
    and pretending to be paralytics! We were acting in a hall, and the most
    infirm of the invalids visiting the place to take the waters were
    wheeled in at the back, and up the center aisle. In the middle of a very
    pathetic scene I caught sight of Kemble and Brookfield in their
    bath-chairs, and could not speak for several minutes.


    Mr. Brookfield does not tell this little story in his "Random
    Reminiscences." It is about the only one that he has left out! To my
    mind he is the prince of storytellers. All the cleverness that he should
    have put into his acting and his play-writing (of which since those
    early days he has done a great deal) he seems to have put into his life.
    I remember him more clearly as a delightful companion than an actor, and
    he won my heart at once by his kindness to my little daughter Edy, who
    accompanied me on this tour. He has too great a sense of humor to resent
    my inadequate recollection of him. Did he not in his own book quote
    gleefully from an obituary notice published on a false report of his
    death, the summary: "Never a great actor, he was invaluable in small
    parts. But after all it is at his club that he will be most missed!"


    In the last act of "Butterfly," as we called the English version of
    "Frou-Frou," where the poor woman is dying, her husband shows her a
    locket with a picture of her child in it. Night after night we used a
    "property" locket, but on my birthday, when we happened to be playing
    the piece, Charles Kelly bought a silver locket of Indian work and put
    inside it two little colored photographs of my children, Edy and
    Teddy,
    and gave it to me on the stage instead of the "property" one. When I
    opened it, I burst into very real tears! I have often wondered since if
    the audience that night knew that they were seeing real instead of
    assumed emotion! Probably the difference did not tell at all.


    At Leeds we produced "Much Ado About Nothing." I never played Beatrice
    as well again. When I began to "take soundings" from life for my idea of
    her, I found in my friend Anne Codrington (now Lady Winchilsea) what I
    wanted. There was before me a Beatrice       as fine a lady as ever lived, a
    great-hearted woman       beautiful, accomplished, merry, tender. When Nan
    Codrington came into a room it was as if the sun came out. She was the
    daughter of an admiral, and always tried to make her room look as like a
    cabin as she could. "An excellent musician," as Benedick hints Beatrice
    was, Nan composed the little song that I sang at the Lyceum in "The
    Cup," and very good it was, too.


          

    
    

          

    ELLEN TERRY AS BEATRICE

    From the collection of Miss Evelyn Smalley

          

    When Henry Irving put on "Much Ado About Nothing"       a play which he may
    be said to have done for me, as he never really liked the part of Benedick       I was not the same Beatrice at all. A great actor can do
    nothing badly, and there was so very much to admire in Henry Irving's
    Benedick. But he gave me little help. Beatrice must be swift, swift,
    swift! Owing to Henry's rather finicking, deliberate method as Benedick,
    I could never put the right pace into my part. I was also feeling
    unhappy about it, because I had been compelled to give way about a
    traditional "gag" in the church scene, with which we ended the fourth
    act. In my own production we had scorned this gag, and let the curtain
    come down on Benedick's line: "Go, comfort your cousin; I must say she
    is dead, and so farewell." When I was told that we were to descend to
    the buffoonery of:


  
    Beatrice: Benedick, kill him       kill him if you can.


    Benedick: As sure as I'm alive, I will!

  


    I protested, and implored Henry not to do it. He said that it was
    necessary: otherwise the "curtain" would be received in dead silence. I
    assured him that we had often had seven and eight calls without it. I
    used every argument, artistic and otherwise. Henry, according to his
    custom, was gentle, would not discuss it much, but remained obdurate.
    After holding out for a week, I gave in. "It's my duty to obey your
    orders, and do it," I said, "but I do it under protest." Then I burst
    into tears. It was really for his sake just as much as for mine. I
    thought it must bring such disgrace on him! Looking back on the
    incident, I find that the most humorous thing in connection with it was
    that the critics, never reluctant to accuse Henry of "monkeying" with
    Shakespeare if they could find cause, never noticed the gag at all!


    Such disagreements occurred very seldom. In "The Merchant of Venice" I
    found that Henry Irving's Shylock necessitated an entire revision of my
    conception of Portia, especially in the trial scene, but here there was
    no point of honor involved. I had considered, and still am of the same
    mind, that Portia in the trial scene ought to be very quiet. I saw an
    extraordinary effect in this quietness. But as Henry's Shylock was
    quiet, I had to give it up. His heroic saint was splendid, but it wasn't
    good for Portia.


    Of course, there were always injudicious friends to say that I had not
    "chances" enough at the Lyceum. Even my father said to me after
    "Othello":


    "We must have no more of these Ophelias and Desdemonas!"


    "Father!" I cried out, really shocked.


    "They're second fiddle parts       not the parts for you, Duchess."


    "Father!" I gasped out again, for really I thought Ophelia a pretty good
    part, and was delighted at my success with it.


    But granting these were "second fiddle" parts, I want to make quite
    clear that I had my turn of "first fiddle" ones. "Romeo and Juliet,"
    "Much Ado About Nothing," "Olivia," and "The Cup" all gave me finer
    opportunities than they gave Henry. In "The Merchant of Venice" and
    "Charles I." they were at least equal to his.


    I have sometimes wondered what I should have accomplished without Henry
    Irving. I might have had "bigger" parts, but it doesn't follow that they
    would have been better ones, and if they had been written by
    contemporary dramatists my success would have been less durable. "No
    actor or actress who doesn't play in the 'classics'       in Shakespeare or
    old comedy       will be heard of long," was one of Henry Irving's sayings,
    by the way, and he was right.


    It was a long time before we had much talk with each other. In the
    "Hamlet" days, Henry Irving's melancholy was appalling. I remember
    feeling as if I had laughed in church when he came to the foot of the
    stairs leading to my dressing-room, and caught me sliding down the
    banisters! He smiled at me, but didn't seem able to get over it.


    "Lacy," he said some days later, "what do you think! I found her the
    other day sliding down the banisters!"


    Some one says       I think it is Keats, in a letter       that the poet lives not
    in one, but in a thousand worlds, and the actor has not one, but a
    hundred natures. What was the real Henry Irving? I used to speculate!


    His religious upbringing always left its mark on him, though no one
    could be more "raffish" and mischievous than he when entertaining
    friends at supper in the Beefsteak Room, or chaffing his valued
    adjutants, Bram Stoker and Loveday. H.J. Loveday, our dear stage
    manager, was, I think, as absolutely devoted to Henry as anyone except
    his fox-terrier, Fussie. Loveday's loyalty made him agree with everything
    that Henry said, however preposterous, and didn't Henry trade on it
    sometimes!


    Once while he was talking to me, when he was making up, he absently took
    a white lily out of a bowl on the table and began to stripe and dot the
    petals with the stick of grease-paint in his hand. He pulled off one or
    two of the petals, and held it out to me.


    "Pretty flower, isn't it?"


    "Oh, don't be ridiculous, Henry!" I said.


    "You wait!" he said mischievously. "We'll show it to Loveday."


    Loveday was sent for on some business connected with the evening's
    performance. Henry held out the flower obtrusively, but Loveday wouldn't
    notice it.


    "Pretty, isn't it?" said Henry carelessly.


    "Very," said Loveday. "I always like those lilies. A friend of mine has
    his garden full of them, and he says they're not so difficult to grow if
    only you give 'em enough water."


    Henry's delight at having "taken in" Loveday was childish. But sometimes
    I think Loveday must have seen through these innocent jokes, only he
    wouldn't have spoiled "the Guv'nor's" bit of fun for the world.


    When Henry first met him he was conducting an orchestra. I forget the
    precise details, but I know that he gave up this position to follow
    Henry, that he was with him during the Bateman régime at the Lyceum, and
    that when the Lyceum became a thing of the past, he still kept the post
    of stage manager. He was literally "faithful unto death," for it was
    only at Henry's death that his service ended.


    Bram Stoker, whose recently published "Reminiscences of Irving" have
    told, as well as it ever can be told, the history of the Lyceum
    Theater under Irving's direction, was as good a servant in the front of
    the theater as Loveday was on the stage. Like a true Irishman, he has
    given me some lovely blarney in his book. He has also told all the
    stories that I might have told, and described every one connected with
    the Lyceum except himself. I can fill that deficiency to a certain
    extent by saying that he is one of the most kind and tender-hearted of
    men. He filled a difficult position with great tact, and was not so
    universally abused as most business managers, because he was always
    straight with the company, and never took a mean advantage of them.


    Stoker and Loveday were daily, nay, hourly, associated for many years
    with Henry Irving; but, after all, did they or any one else really
    know him? And what was Henry Irving's attitude. I believe myself that he
    never wholly trusted his friends, and never admitted them to his
    intimacy, although they thought he did, which was the same thing to
    them.


    From his childhood up, Henry was lonely. His chief companions in youth
    were the Bible and Shakespeare. He used to study "Hamlet" in the Cornish
    fields, when he was sent out by his aunt, Mrs. Penberthy, to call in the
    cows. One day, when he was in one of the deep, narrow lanes common in
    that part of England, he looked up and saw the face of a sweet little
    lamb gazing at him from the top of the bank. The symbol of the lamb in
    the Bible had always attracted him, and his heart went out to the dear
    little creature. With some difficulty he scrambled up the bank,
    slipping often in the damp, red earth, threw his arms round the lamb's
    neck and kissed it.


    The lamb bit him!


    Did this set-back in early childhood influence him? I wonder! He had
    another such set-back when he first went on the stage, and for some six
    weeks in Dublin was subjected every night to groans, hoots, hisses, and
    cat-calls from audiences who resented him because he had taken the place
    of a dismissed favorite. In such a situation an actor is not likely to
    take stock of reasons. Henry Irving only knew that the Dublin people
    made him the object of violent personal antipathy. "I played my parts
    not badly for me," he said simply, "in spite of the howls of execration
    with which I was received."


    The bitterness of this Dublin episode was never quite forgotten. It
    colored Henry Irving's attitude towards the public. When he made his
    humble little speeches of thanks to them before the curtain, there was
    always a touch of pride in the humility. Perhaps he would not have
    received adulation in quite the same dignified way if he had never known
    what it was to wear the martyr's "shirt of flame."


    This is the worst of my trying to give a consecutive narrative of my
    first years at the Lyceum. Henry Irving looms across them, reducing all
    events, all feelings, all that happened, and all that was suggested, to
    pigmy size.


    Let me speak generally of his method of procedure in producing a play.


    First he studied it for three months himself, and nothing in that play
    would escape him. Some one once asked him a question about "Titus
    Andronicus." "God bless my soul!" he said. "I never read it, so how
    should I know!" The Shakespearean scholar who had questioned him was a
    little shocked       a fact which Henry Irving, the closest observer of men,
    did not fail to notice.


    "When I am going to do 'Titus Andronicus,' or any other play," he said
    to me afterwards, "I shall know more about it than A               or any other
    student."


    There was no conceit in this. It was just a statement of fact. And it
    may not have been an admirable quality of Henry Irving's, but all his
    life he only took an interest in the things which concerned the work
    that he had in hand. When there was a question of his playing Napoleon,
    his room at Grafton Street was filled with Napoleonic literature. Busts
    of Napoleon, pictures of Napoleon, relics of Napoleon were everywhere.
    Then, when another play was being prepared, the busts, however fine,
    would probably go down to the cellar. It was not Napoleon who
    interested Henry Irving, but Napoleon for his purpose       two very
    different things.

          

    
    

          

    SIR HENRY IRVING

    From the painting by Sir John Millais, Bart., P.R.A.

          

    His concentration during his three months' study of the play which he
    had in view was marvelous. When, at the end of the three-months, he
    called the first rehearsal, he read the play exactly as it was going to
    be done on the first night. He knew exactly by that time what he
    personally was going to do on the first night, and the company did well
    to notice how he read his own part, for never again until the first
    night, though he rehearsed with them, would he show his conception so
    fully and completely.


    These readings, which took place sometimes in the greenroom or Beefsteak
    Room at the Lyceum, sometimes at his house in Grafton Street, were
    wonderful. Never were the names of the characters said by the reader,
    but never was there the slightest doubt as to which was speaking. Henry
    Irving swiftly, surely, acted every part in the piece as he read. While
    he read, he made notes as to the position of the characters and the
    order of the crowds and processions. At the end of the first reading he
    gave out the parts.


    The next day there was the "comparing" of the parts. It generally took
    place on the stage, and we sat down for it. Each person took his own
    character, and took up the cues to make sure that no blunder had been
    made in writing them out. Parts at the Lyceum were written, or printed,
    not typed.


    These first two rehearsals       the one devoted to the reading of the play,
    and the other to the comparing of the parts, were generally arranged for
    Thursday and Friday. Then there was two days' grace. On Monday came the
    first stand-up rehearsal on the stage.


    We then did one act straight through, and, after that, straight through
    again, even if it took all day. There was no luncheon interval. People
    took a bite when they could, or went without. Henry himself generally
    went without. The second day exactly the same method was pursued with
    the second act. All the time Henry gave the stage his personal
    direction, gave it keenly, and gave it whole. He was the sole
    superintendent of his rehearsals, with Mr. Loveday as his working
    assistant, and Mr. Allen as his prompter. This despotism meant much less
    wasted time than when actor-manager, "producer," literary adviser, stage
    manager, and any one who likes to offer a suggestion are all competing
    in giving orders and advice to a company.


    Henry Irving never spent much time on the women in the company, except
    in regard to position. Sometimes he would ask me to suggest things to
    them, to do for them what he did for the men. The men were as much like
    him when they tried to carry out his instructions as brass is like gold;
    but he never grew weary of "coaching" them, down to the most minute
    detail. Once during the rehearsals of "Hamlet" I saw him growing more
    and more fatigued with his efforts to get the actors who opened the play
    to perceive his meaning. He wanted the first voice to ring out like a
    pistol shot.


    "Who's there?"


    "Do give it up," I said. "It's no better!"


    "Yes, it's a little better," he answered quietly, "and so it's worth
    doing."


    From the first the scenery or substitute scenery was put upon the stage
    for rehearsal, and the properties or substitute properties were to hand.


    After each act had been gone through twice each day, it came to half an
    act once in a whole day, because of the development of detail. There was
    no detail too small for Henry Irving's notice. He never missed anything
    that was cumulative       that would contribute something to the whole
    effect.


    The messenger who came in to announce something always needed a great
    deal of rehearsal. There were processions, and half processions, quiet
    bits when no word was spoken. There was timing. Nothing was left to
    chance.


    In the master carpenter, Arnott, we had a splendid man. He inspired
    confidence at once through his strong, able personality, and, as time
    went on, deserved it through all the knowledge he acquired and through
    his excellence in never making a difficulty.


    "You shall have it," was no bluff from Arnott. You did "have it."


    We could not find precisely the right material for one of my dresses in
    "The Cup." At last, poking about myself in quest of it, I came across
    the very thing at Liberty's       a saffron silk with a design woven into it
    by hand with many-colored threads and little jewels. I brought a yard to
    rehearsal. It was declared perfect, but I declared the price
    prohibitive.


    "It's twelve guineas a yard, and I shall want yards and yards!"


    In these days I am afraid they would not only put such material on to
    the leading lady, but on to the supers too! At the Lyceum wanton
    extravagance was unknown.


    "Where can I get anything at all like it?"


    "You leave it to me," said Arnott. "I'll get it for you. That'll be all
    right.


    "But, Arnott, it's a hand-woven Indian material. How can you get it?"


    "You leave it to me," Arnott repeated in his slow, quiet, confident way.
    "Do you mind letting me have this yard as a pattern?"


    He went off with it, and before the dress rehearsal had produced about
    twenty yards of silk, which on the stage looked better than the
    twelve-guinea original.


    "There's plenty more if you want it," he said dryly.


    He had had some raw silk dyed the exact saffron. He had had two blocks
    made, one red and the other black, and the design had been printed, and
    a few cheap spangles had been added to replace the real jewels. My toga
    looked beautiful.


    This was but one of the many emergencies to which Arnott rose with
    talent and promptitude.


    With the staff of the theater he was a bit of a bully       one of those men
    not easily roused, but being vexed, "nasty in the extreme!" As a
    craftsman he had wonderful taste, and could copy antique furniture so
    that one could not tell the copy from the original.


    The great aim at the Lyceum was to get everything "rotten perfect," as
    the theatrical slang has it, before the dress rehearsal. Father's test
    of being rotten perfect was not a bad one. "If you can get out of bed in
    the middle of the night and do your part, you're perfect. If you can't,
    you don't really know it!"


    Henry Irving applied some such test to every one concerned in the
    production. I cannot remember any play at the Lyceum which did not begin
    punctually and end at the advertised time, except "Olivia," when some
    unwise changes in the last act led to delay.


    He never hesitated to discard scenery if it did not suit his purpose.
    There was enough scenery rejected in "Faust" to have furnished three
    productions, and what was finally used for the famous Brocken scene cost
    next to nothing.


    Even the best scene-painters sometimes think more of their pictures than
    of scenic effects. Henry would never accept anything that was not right
    theatrically as well as pictorially beautiful. His instinct in this
    was unerring and incomparable.


    I remember that at one scene-rehearsal every one was fatuously pleased
    with the scenery. Henry sat in the stalls talking about everything but
    the scenery. It was hard to tell what he thought.


    "Well, are you ready?" he asked at last.


    "Yes, sir."


    "My God! Is that what you think I am going to give the public?"


    Never shall I forget the astonishment of stage manager, scene-painter,
    and staff! It was never safe to indulge in too much self-satisfaction
    beforehand with Henry. He was always liable to drop such bombs!


    He believed very much in "front" scenes, seeing how necessary they were
    to the swift progress of Shakespeare's diverging plots. These cloths
    were sometimes so wonderfully painted and lighted that they constituted
    scenes of remarkable beauty. The best of all were the Apothecary scene
    in "Romeo and Juliet" and the exterior of Aufidius's house in
    "Coriolanus."


    We never had electricity installed at the Lyceum until Daly took the
    theater. When I saw the effect on the faces of the electric footlights,
    I entreated Henry to have the gas restored, and he did. We used gas
    footlights and gas limes there until we left the theater for good in 1902.

    To this I attribute much of the beauty of our lighting. I say "our"
    because this was a branch of Henry's work in which I was always his
    chief helper. Until electricity has been greatly improved and developed,
    it can never be to the stage what gas was. The thick softness of
    gaslight, with the lovely specks and motes in it, so like natural
    light, gave illusion to many a scene which is now revealed in all its
    naked trashiness by electricity.


    The artificial is always noticed and recognized as art by the
    superficial critic. I think this is what made some people think
    Irving
    was at his best in such parts as Louis XI, Dubosc, and Richard III. He
    could have played Louis XI three times a day "on his head," as the
    saying is. In "The Lyons Mail," Dubosc the wicked man was easy
    enough       strange that the unprofessional looker-on always admires the
    actor's art when it is employed on easy things!       but Lesurques, the
    good man in the same play ("The Lyons Mail"), was difficult. Any
    actor, skillful in the tricks of the business, can play the drunkard;
    but to play a good man sincerely, as he did here, to show that double
    thing, the look of guilt which an innocent man wears when accused of
    crime, requires great acting, for "the look" is the outward and
    visible sign of the inward and spiritual emotion       and this delicate
    emotion can only be perfectly expressed when the actor's heart and mind
    and soul and skill are in absolute accord.


          

    
    

          

    IRVING AS LOUIS XI

          

    In dual parts Irving depended little on make-up. Make-up was, indeed,
    always his servant, not his master. He knew its uselessness when not
    informed by the spirit. "The letter" (and in characterization
    grease-paint is the letter) "killeth       the spirit giveth life." His
    Lesurques was different from his Dubosc because of the way he held his
    shoulders, because of his expression. He always took a deep interest in
    crime (an interest which his sons have inherited), and often went to the
    police-court to study the faces of the accused. He told me that the
    innocent man generally looked guilty and hesitated when asked a
    question, but that the round, wide-open eyes corrected the bad
    impression. The result of this careful watching was seen in his
    expression as Lesurques. He opened his eyes wide. As Dubosc he kept them
    half closed.


    Our plays from 1878 to 1887 were "Hamlet," "The Lady of Lyons," "Eugene Aram," "Charles I.," "The Merchant of Venice," "Iolanthe," "The Cup,"
    "The Belle's Stratagem," "Othello," "Romeo and Juliet," "Much Ado About
    Nothing," "Twelfth Night," "Olivia," "Faust," "Raising the Wind," and
    "The Amber Heart." I give this list to keep myself straight. My mental
    division of the years at the Lyceum is before "Macbeth," and after.
    I divide it up like this, perhaps, because "Macbeth" was the most
    important of all our productions, if I judge it by the amount of
    preparation and thought that it cost us and by the discussion which it
    provoked.


    Of the characters played by Henry Irving in the plays of the first
    division       before "Macbeth," that is to say       I think every one knows that
    I considered Hamlet to be his greatest triumph. Sometimes I think that
    was so because it was the only part that was big enough for him. It was
    more difficult, and he had more scope in it than in any other. If there
    had been a finer part than Hamlet, that particular part would have been
    his finest.


    When one praises an actor in this way, one is always open to accusations
    of prejudice, hyperbole, uncritical gush, unreasoned eulogy, and the
    rest. Must a careful and deliberate opinion always deny a great man
    genius? If so, no careful and deliberate opinions from me!


    I have no doubt in the world of Irving's genius       no doubt that he is
    with David Garrick and Edmund Kean, rather than with other actors of
    great talents and great achievements       actors who rightly won high
    opinions from the multitude of their day, but who have not left behind
    them an impression of that inexplicable thing which we call genius.


    Since my great comrade died I have read many biographies of him, and
    nearly all of them denied what I assert. "Now, who shall arbitrate?" I
    find no contradiction of my testimony in the fact that he was not
    appreciated for a long time, that some found him like olives, an
    acquired taste, that others mocked and derided him.


    My father, who worshiped Macready, put Irving above him because of
    Irving's originality. The old school were not usually so generous.
    Fanny Kemble thought it necessary to write as follows of one who had had
    his share of misfortune and failure before he came into his kingdom and
    made her jealous, I suppose, for the dead kings among her kindred:


  
                   "I have seen some of the accounts and critics of Mr. Irving's acting, and rather elaborate ones of his Hamlet, which, however, give me no very distinct idea of his performance, and a very hazy one indeed of the part itself as seen from the point of view of his critics.
Edward Fitzgerald wrote me word that he looked like my people, and sent me a photograph to prove it, which I thought much more like Young than my father or uncle. I have not seen a play of Shakespeare's acted I do not know when. I think I should find such an exhibition extremely curious as well as entertaining."

  


    Now, shall I put on record what Henry Irving thought of Fanny Kemble! If
    there is a touch of malice in my doing so, surely the passage that I
    have quoted gives me leave.

    Having lived with Hamlet nearly all his life, studied the part when he
    was a clerk, dreamed of a day when he might play it, the young Henry
    Irving saw that Mrs. Butler, the famous Fanny Kemble, was going to give
    a reading of the play. His heart throbbed high with anticipation, for in
    those days TRADITION was everything       the name of Kemble a beacon and a
    star.


    The studious young clerk went to the reading.


    An attendant came on to the platform, first, and made trivial and
    apparently unnecessary alterations in the position of the reading desk.
    A glass of water and a book were placed on it.


    After a portentous wait, on swept a lady with an extraordinary flashing
    eye, a masculine and muscular outside. Pounding the book with terrific
    energy, as if she wished to knock the stuffing out of it, she announced
    in thrilling tones:


  
    
      
        
          
            
              
"'HAM       A       LETTE.'

By

Will       y       am Shak       es       peare."

              
            
          
        
      
    
  


    "I suppose this is all right," thought the young clerk, a little
    dismayed at the fierce and sectional enunciation.


    Then the reader came to Act I, Sc. 2, which the old actor (to leave the
    Kemble reading for a minute), with but a hazy notion of the text, used
    to begin:


  
    
      
        
          
"Although of Hamlet, our dear brother's death,
The memory be       memory be       (What is the color?) green"....

          
        
      
    
  


    When Fanny Kemble came to this scene the future Hamlet began to listen
    more intently.


  
     Gertrude: Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Ham       a       lette.


     Hamlet: I shall in all respects obey you, madam (obviously with a fiery flashing eye of hate upon the King).

  


    When he heard this and more like it, Henry Irving exercised his
    independence of opinion and refused to accept Fanny Kemble's view of the
    gentle, melancholy, and well-bred Prince of Denmark.


    He was a stickler for tradition, and always studied it, followed it,
    sometimes to his own detriment, but he was not influenced by the Kemble
    Hamlet, except that for some time he wore the absurd John Philip
    feather, which he would have been much better without!


    Let me pray that I, representing the old school, may never look on the
    new school with the patronizing airs of "Old Fitz"3 and Fanny Kemble.
    I wish that I could see the new school of acting in Shakespeare.
    Shakespeare must be kept up, or we shall become a third-rate nation!


    Henry told me this story of Fanny Kemble's reading without a spark of
    ill-nature, but with many a gleam of humor. He told me at the same time
    of the wonderful effect that Adelaide Kemble (Mrs. Sartoris) used to
    make when she recited Shelley's lines, beginning:


  
    
      
        
          
            
              
"Good-night       Ah, no, the hour is ill
       Which severs those it should unite.
Let us remain together still       
       Then it will be good-night!"

              
            
          
        
      
    
  


    I have already said that I never could cope with Pauline Deschapelles,
    and why Henry wanted to play Melnotte was a mystery. Claude Melnotte
    after Hamlet! Oddly enough, Henry was always attracted by fustian. He
    simply reveled in the big speeches. The play was beautifully staged; the
    garden scene alone probably cost as much as the whole of "Hamlet." The
    march past the window of the apparently unending army       that good old
    trick which sends the supers flying round the back-cloth to cross the
    stage again and again       created a superb effect. The curtain used to go
    up and down as often as we liked and chose to keep the army marching!
    The play ran some time, I suppose because even at our worst the public
    found something in our acting to like.


    As Ruth Meadowes I had very little to do, but what there was, was worth
    doing. The last act of "Eugene Aram," like the last act of "Ravenswood,"
    gave me opportunity. It was staged with a great appreciation of grim and
    poetic effect. Henry always thought that the dark, overhanging branch of
    the cedar was like the cruel outstretched hand of Fate. He called it the
    Fate Tree, and used it in "Hamlet," in "Eugene Aram," and in "Romeo and
    Juliet."


    In "Eugene Aram," the Fate Tree drooped low over the graves in the
    churchyard. On one of them Henry used to be lying in a black cloak as
    the curtain went up on the last act. Not until a moonbeam struck the
    dark mass did you see that it was a man.


    He played all such parts well. Melancholy and the horrors had a peculiar
    fascination for him       especially in these early days. But his recitation
    of the poem "Eugene Aram" was finer than anything in the
    play       especially when he did it in a frock-coat. No one ever looked so
    well in a frock-coat! He was always ready to recite it       used to do it
    after supper, anywhere. We had a talk about it once, and I told him that
    it was too much for a room. No man was ever more willing to listen to
    suggestion or less obstinate about taking advice. He immediately
    moderated his methods when reciting in a room, making it all the less
    theatrical. The play was a good répertoire play, and we did it later on
    in America with success. There the part of Houseman was played by
    Terriss, who was quite splendid in it, and at Chicago my little boy
    Teddy made his second appearance on any stage as Joey, a gardener's boy.
    He had, when still a mere baby, come on to the stage at the Court in
    "Olivia," and this must be counted his first appearance, although the
    chroniclers, ignoring both that and Joey in "Eugene Aram," say he
    never appeared at all until he played an important part in "The Dead
    Heart."


    It is because of Teddy that "Eugene Aram" is associated in my mind with
    one of the most beautiful sights upon the stage that I ever saw in my
    life. He was about ten or eleven at the time, and as he tied up the
    stage roses, his cheeks, untouched by rouge, put the reddest of them to
    shame! He was so graceful and natural; he spoke his lines with ease, and
    smiled all over his face! "A born actor!" I said, although Joey was my
    son. Whenever I think of him in that stage garden, I weep for pride, and
    for sorrow, too, because before he was thirty my son had left the
    stage       he who had it all in him. I have good reason to be proud of what
    he has done since, but I regret the lost actor always.


    Henry Irving could not at first keep away from melancholy pieces.
    Henrietta Maria was another sad part for me       but I used to play it well,
    except when I cried too much in the last act. The play had been one of
    the Bateman productions, and I had seen Miss Isabel Bateman as Henrietta
    Maria and liked her, although I could not find it possible to follow her
    example and play the part with a French accent! I constantly catch
    myself saying of Henry Irving, "That is by far the best thing that he
    ever did." I could say it of some things in "Charles I."       of the way he
    gave up his sword to Cromwell, of the way he came into the room in the
    last act and shut the door behind him. It was not a man coming on to a
    stage to meet some one. It was a king going to the scaffold, quietly,
    unobtrusively, and courageously. However often I played that scene with
    him, I knew that when he first came on he was not aware of my presence
    nor of any earthly presence: he seemed to be already in heaven.

          

    
    

          

    ELLEN TERRY AS HENRIETTA MARIA

          

          Much has been said of his "make-up" as Charles I. Edwin Long painted him
    a triptych of Vandyck heads, which he always had in his dressing-room,
    and which is now in my possession. He used to come on to the stage
    looking precisely like the Vandyck portraits, but not because he had
    been busy building up his face with wig-paste and similar atrocities.
    His make-up in this, as in other parts, was the process of assisting
    subtly and surely the expression from within. It was elastic, and never
    hampered him. It changed with the expression. As Charles, he was
    assisted by Nature, who had given him the most beautiful Stuart hands,
    but his clothes most actors would have consigned to the dust-bin! Before
    we had done with Charles I.       we played it together for the last time in
    1902       these clothes were really threadbare. Yet he looked in them every
    inch a king.


    His care of detail may be judged from the fact that in the last act his
    wig was not only grayer, but had far less hair in it. I should hardly
    think it necessary to mention this if I had not noticed how many actors
    seem to think that age may be procured by the simple expedient of
    dipping their heads, covered with mats of flourishing hair, into a
    flour-barrel!


    Unlike most stage kings, he never seemed to be assuming dignity. He
    was very, very simple.


    Wills has been much blamed for making Cromwell out to be such a
    wretch       a mean blackguard, not even a great bad man. But in plays the
    villain must not compete for sympathy with the hero, or both fall to the
    ground! I think that Wills showed himself a true poet in his play, and
    in the last act a great playwright. He gave us both wonderful
    opportunities, yet very few words were spoken.


    Some people thought me best in the camp scene in the third act, where I
    had even fewer lines to speak. I was proud of it myself when I found
    that it had inspired Oscar Wilde to write me this lovely sonnet:


  
    
      
        
          
            
In the lone tent, waiting for victory,
She stands with eyes marred by the mists of pain,
Like some wan lily overdrenched with rain;
The clamorous clang of arms, the ensanguined sky,
War's ruin, and the wreck of chivalry
To her proud soul no common fear can bring;
Bravely she tarrieth for her Lord, the King,
Her soul aflame with passionate ecstasy.
O, hair of gold! O, crimson lips! O, face
Made for the luring and the love of man!
With thee I do forget the toil and stress,
The loveless road that knows no resting place,
Time's straitened pulse, the soul's dread weariness,
My freedom, and my life republican!

            
          
        
      
    
  


    That phrase "wan lily" represented perfectly what I had tried to convey,
    not only in this part but in Ophelia. I hope I thanked Oscar enough at
    the time. Now he is dead, and I cannot thank him any more.... I had so
    much bad poetry written to me that these lovely sonnets from a real
    poet should have given me the greater pleasure. "He often has the poet's
    heart, who never felt the poet's fire." There is more good heart and
    kind feeling in most of the verses written to me than real poetry.


    "One must discriminate," even if it sounds unkind. At the time that
    Whistler was having one of his most undignified "rows" with a sitter
    over a portrait and wrangling over the price, another artist was
    painting frescoes in a cathedral for nothing. "It is sad that it should
    be so," a friend said to me, "but one must discriminate. The man
    haggling over the sixpence is the great artist!"


    How splendid it is that in time this is recognized. The immortal soul
    of the artist is in his work, the transient and mortal one is in his
    conduct.


    Another sonnet from Oscar Wilde       to Portia this time       is the first
    document that I find in connection with "The Merchant," as the play was
    always called by the theater staff.


  
    
      
        
          
            
"I marvel not Bassanio was so bold
To peril all he had upon the lead,
Or that proud Aragon bent low his head,
Or that Morocco's fiery heart grew cold;
For in that gorgeous dress of beaten gold,
Which is more golden than the golden sun,
No woman Veronese looked upon
Was half so fair as thou whom I behold.
Yet fairer when with wisdom as your shield
The sober-suited lawyer's gown you donned,
And would not let the laws of Venice yield
Antonio's heart to that accursed Jew       
O, Portia! take my heart; it is thy due:
I think I will not quarrel with the Bond."

            
          
        
      
    
  


    Henry Irving's Shylock dress was designed by Sir John Gilbert. It was
    never replaced, and only once cleaned by Henry's dresser and valet,
    Walter Collinson. Walter, I think, replaced "Doody," Henry's first
    dresser at the Lyceum, during the run of "The Merchant of Venice."
    Walter was a wig-maker by trade       assistant to Clarkson the elder. It was Doody who, on being asked his opinion of a production, said that it was
    fine       "not a join4 to be seen anywhere!" It was Walter who was asked
    by Henry to say which he thought his master's best part. Walter could
    not be "drawn" for a long time. At last he said Macbeth.


    This pleased Henry immensely, for, as I hope to show later on, he
    fancied himself in Macbeth more than in any other part.


    "It is generally conceded to be Hamlet," said Henry.


    "Oh, no, sir," said Walter, "Macbeth. You sweat twice as much in
    that."


    In appearance Walter was very like Shakespeare's bust in Stratford
    Church. He was a most faithful and devoted servant, and was the only
    person with Henry Irving when he died. Quiet in his ways, discreet,
    gentle, and very quick, he was the ideal dresser.


    The Lyceum production of "The Merchant of Venice" was not so strictly
    archaeological as the Bancrofts' had been, but it was very gravely
    beautiful and effective. If less attention was paid to details of
    costumes and scenery, the play itself was arranged and acted very
    attractively and always went with a swing. To the end of my partnership
    with Henry Irving it was a safe "draw" both in England and America. By
    this time I must have played Portia over a thousand times. During the
    first run of it the severe attack made on my acting of the part in
    Blackwood's Magazine is worth alluding to. The suggestion that I
    showed too much of a "coming-on" disposition in the Casket Scene
    affected me for years, and made me self-conscious and uncomfortable. At
    last I lived it down. Any suggestion of indelicacy in my treatment of
    a part always blighted me. Mr. Dodgson (Lewis Carroll, of the immortal
    "Alice in Wonderland") once brought a little girl to see me in "Faust."
    He wrote and told me that she had said (where Margaret begins to
    undress): "Where is it going to stop?" and that perhaps in consideration
    of the fact that it could affect a mere child disagreeably, I ought to
    alter my business!


    I had known dear Mr. Dodgson for years and years. He was as fond of me
    as he could be of any one over the age of ten, but I was furious. "I
    thought you only knew nice children," was all the answer that I gave
    him. "It would have seemed to me awful for a child to see harm where
    harm is; how much more when she sees it where harm is not."


    But I felt ashamed and shy whenever I played that scene. It was the
    Casket Scene over again.


    The unkind Blackwood article also blamed me for showing too plainly
    that Portia loves Bassanio before he has actually won her. This seemed
    to me unjust, if only because Shakespeare makes Portia say before
    Bassanio chooses the right casket:

"One half of me is yours       the other half yours       All yours!      


    Surely this suggests that she was not concealing her fondness like a
    Victorian maiden, and that Bassanio had most surely won her love, though
    not yet the right to be her husband.


    "There is a soul of goodness in things evil," and the criticism made me
    alter the setting of the scene, and so contrive it that Portia was
    behind and out of sight of the men who made hazard for her love.


    Dr. Furnivall, a great Shakespearean scholar, was so kind as to write me
    the following letter about Portia:


  
                   "Being founder and director of the New Shakespeare Society, I venture to thank you most heartily for your most charming and admirable impersonation of our poet's Portia, which I witnessed to-night with a real delight. You have given me a new light on the character, and by your so pretty by-play in the Casket Scene have made bright in my memory for ever the spot which almost all critics have felt dull, and I hope to say this in a new edition of       'Shakespeare.'"

  


    (He did say it, in "The Leopold" edition.)


  
                   "Again those touches of the wife's love in the advocate when Bassanio says he'd give up his wife for Antonio, and when you kissed your hand to him behind his back in the Ring bit       how pretty and natural they were! Your whole conception and acting of the character are so true to Shakespeare's lines that one longs he could be here to see you. A lady gracious and graceful, handsome, witty, loving and wise, you are his Portia to the life."

  


    That's the best of Shakespeare, I say. His characters can be
    interpreted in at least eight different ways, and of each way some one
    will say: "That is Shakespeare!" The German actress plays Portia as a
    low comedy part. She wears an eighteenth-century law wig, horn
    spectacles, a cravat (this last anachronism is not confined to Germans),
    and often a mustache! There is something to be said for it all, though I
    should not like to play the part that way myself.

    Lady Pollock, who first brought me to Henry Irving's notice as a
    possible leading lady, thought my Portia better at the Lyceum than it
    had been at the Prince of Wales's.


  
                   "Thanks, my dear Valentine and enchanting Portia," she writes to me in response to a photograph that I had sent her, "but the photographers don't see you as you are, and have not the poetry in them to do you justice.... You were especially admirable in the Casket Scene. You kept your by-play quieter, and it gained in effect from the addition of repose       and I rejoiced that you did not kneel to Bassanio at 'My Lord, my governor, my King.' I used to feel that too much like worship from any girl to her affianced, and Portia's position being one of command, I should doubt the possibility of such an action...."

  


    I think I received more letters about my Portia than about all my other
    parts put together. Many of them came from university men. One old
    playgoer wrote to tell me that he liked me better than my former
    instructress, Mrs. Charles Kean. "She mouthed it as she did most
    things.... She was not real       a staid, sentimental 'Anglaise,' and more
    than a little stiffly pokerish."


    Henry Irving's Shylock was generally conceded to be full of talent and
    reality, but some of his critics could not resist saying that this was
    not the Jew that Shakespeare drew! Now, who is in a position to say
    what is the Jew that Shakespeare drew? I think Henry Irving knew as
    well as most! Nay, I am sure that in his age he was the only person
    able to decide.


    Some said his Shylock was intellectual, and appealed more to the
    intellect of his audiences than to their emotions. Surely this is
    talking for the sake of talking. I recall so many things that touched
    people to the heart! For absolute pathos, achieved by absolute
    simplicity of means, I never saw anything in the theater to compare with
    his Shylock's return home over the bridge to his deserted house after
    Jessica's flight.


    A younger actor, producing "The Merchant of Venice" in recent years,
    asked Irving if he might borrow this bit of business. "By all means,"
    said Henry. "With great pleasure."


    "Then, why didn't you do it?" inquired my daughter bluntly when the
    actor was telling us how kind and courteous Henry had been in allowing
    him to use his stroke of invention.


    "What do you mean?" asked the astonished actor.


    My daughter told him that Henry had dropped the curtain on a stage full
    of noise, and light, and revelry. When it went up again the stage was
    empty, desolate, with no light but a pale moon, and all sounds of life
    at a great distance       and then over the bridge came the wearied figure of
    the Jew. This marked the passing of the time between Jessica's elopement
    and Shylock's return home. It created an atmosphere of silence, and the
    middle of the night.


    "You came back without dropping the curtain," said my daughter, "and
    so it wasn't a bit the same."


    "I couldn't risk dropping the curtain for the business," answered the
    actor, "because it needed applause to take it up again!"


    Henry Irving never grew tired of a part, never ceased to work at it,
    just as he never gave up the fight against his limitations. His diction,
    as the years went on, grew far clearer when he was depicting rage and
    passion. His dragging leg dragged no more. To this heroic perseverance
    he added an almost childlike eagerness in hearing any suggestion for the
    improvement of his interpretations which commended itself to his
    imagination and his judgment. From a blind man came the most
    illuminating criticism of his Shylock. The sensitive ear of the
    sightless hearer detected a fault in Henry Irving's method of delivering
    the opening line of his part:


    "Three thousand ducats       well!"


    "I hear no sound of the usurer in that," the blind man said at the end
    of the performance. "It is said with the reflective air of a man to whom
    money means very little."


    The justice of the criticism appealed strongly to Henry. He revised his
    reading not only of the first line, but of many other lines in which he
    saw now that he had not been enough of the money-lender.


    In more recent years he made one change in his dress. He asked my
    daughter       whose cleverness in such things he fully recognized       to put
    some stage jewels on to the scarf that he wore round his head when he
    supped with the Christians.


    "I have an idea that, when he went to that supper, he'd like to flaunt
    his wealth in the Christian dogs' faces. It will look well, too       'like
    the toad, ugly and venomous,' wearing precious jewels on his head!"


    The scarf, witnessing to that untiring love of throwing new light on his
    impersonations which distinguished Henry to the last, is now in my
    daughter's possession. She values no relic of him more unless it be the
    wreath of oak-leaves that she made him for "Coriolanus."


    We had a beautiful scene for this play       a garden with a dark pine forest
    in the distance. Henry was not good in it. He had a Romeo part which
    had not been written by Shakespeare. We played it instead of the last
    act of "The Merchant of Venice." I never liked it being left out, but
    people used to say, like parrots, that "the interest of the play ended
    with the Trial Scene," and Henry believed them       for a time. I never did.
    Shakespeare never gives up in the last act like most dramatists.


    Twice in "Iolanthe" I forgot that I was blind! The first time was when I
    saw old Tom Mead and Henry Irving groping for the amulet, which they had
    to put on my breast to heal me of my infirmity. It had slipped on to the
    floor, and both of them were too short-sighted to see it! Here was a
    predicament! I had to stoop and pick it up for them.

    The second time I put out my hand and cried: "Look out for my lilies,"
    when Henry nearly stepped on the bunch with which a little girl friend
    of mine supplied me every night I played the part.


    Iolanthe was one of Helen Faucit's great successes. I never saw this
    distinguished actress when she was in her prime. Her Rosalind, when she
    came out of her retirement to play a few performances, appeared to me
    more like a lecture on Rosalind, than like Rosalind herself: a lecture
    all young actresses would have greatly benefited by hearing, for it was
    of great beauty. I remember being particularly struck by her treatment
    of the lines in the scene where Celia conducts the mock marriage between
    Orlando and Ganymede. Another actress, whom I saw as Rosalind, said the
    words, "And I do take thee, Orlando, to be my husband," with a comical
    grimace to the audience. Helen Faucit flushed up and said the line with
    deep and true emotion, suggesting that she was, indeed, giving herself
    to Orlando. There was a world of poetry in the way she drooped over his
    hand.


    Mead distinguished himself in "Iolanthe" by speaking of "that immortal
    land where God hath His       His       er       room?       no       lodging?       no       where God
    hath His apartments!"


    The word he could not hit was, I think, "dwelling." He used often to try
    five or six words before he got the right one or the wrong one       it was
    generally the wrong one       in full hearing of the audience.

          

    IX
    LYCEUM PRODUCTIONS
    "THE MERCHANT OF VENICE" TO "ROMEO AND JULIET"


    "The Merchant of Venice" was acted two hundred and fifty consecutive
    nights on the occasion of the first production. On the hundredth night
    every member of the audience was presented with Henry Irving's acting
    edition of the play bound in white velum       a solid and permanent
    souvenir, paper, print and binding all being of the best. The famous Chiswick Press did all his work of this kind. On the title page was
    printed:


  
    
      
        
          
            
"I count myself in nothing else so happy
As in a soul remembering my good friends."

            
          
        
      
    
  


    At the close of the performance which took place on Saturday, February
    14, 1880, Henry entertained a party of 350 to supper on the stage. This
    was the first of those enormous gatherings which afterwards became an
    institution at the Lyceum.


    It was at this supper that Lord Houghton surprised us all by making a
    very sarcastic speech about the stage and actors generally. It was no
    doubt more interesting than the "butter" which is usually applied to the
    profession at such functions, but every one felt that it was rather rude
    to abuse long runs when the company were met to celebrate a hundredth
    performance!


    Henry Irving's answer was delightful. He spoke with good sense, good
    humour and good breeding, and it was all spontaneous. I wish that a
    phonograph had been in existence that night, and that a record had been
    taken of the speech. It would be so good for the people who have
    asserted that Henry Irving always employed journalists (when he could
    not get Poets Laureate!) to write his speeches for him! The voice was
    always the voice of Irving, if the hands were sometimes the hands of the
    professional writer. When Henry was thrown on his debating resources he
    really spoke better than when he prepared a speech, and his letters
    prove, if proof were needed, how finely he could write! Those who
    represent him as dependent in such matters on the help of literary hacks
    are just ignorant of the facts.


    During the many years that I played Portia I seldom had a Bassanio to my
    mind. It seems to be a most difficult part, to judge by the colorless
    and disappointing renderings that are given of it. George Alexander was
    far the best of my Bassanio bunch! Mr. Barnes, "handsome Jack Barnes,"
    as we called him, was a good actor, is a good actor still, as every one
    knows, but his gentility as Bassanio was overwhelming. It was said of
    him that he thought more of the rounding of his legs than the charms of
    his affianced wife, and that in the love-scenes he appeared to be taking
    orders for furniture! This was putting it unkindly, but there was some
    truth in it.


    He was so very dignified! My sister Floss (Floss was the first Lyceum Nerissa) and I once tried to make him laugh by substituting two "almond
    rings" for the real rings. "Handsome Jack" lost his temper, which made
    us laugh the more. He was quite right to be angry. Such fooling on the
    stage is very silly. I think it is one of the evils of long runs! When
    we had seen "handsome Jack Barnes" imperturbably pompous for two hundred
    nights in succession, it became too much for us, and the almond rings
    were the result.


    Mr. Tyars was the Prince of Morocco. Actors might come, and actors might
    go in the Lyceum company, but Tyars went on for ever. He never left
    Henry Irving's management, and was with him in that last performance of
    "Becket" at Bradford on October 13, 1905       the last performance ever
    given by Henry Irving who died the same night.


    Tyars was the most useful actor that we ever had in the company. I
    should think that the number of parts he has played in the same piece
    would constitute a theatrical record.


    I don't remember when Tom Mead first played the Duke, but I remember
    what happened!

"Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too."


    He began the speech in the Trial Scene very slowly.


    Between every word Henry was whispering: "Get on       get on!" Old Mead,
    whose memory was never good, became flustered, and at the end of the
    line came to a dead stop.


    "Get on, get on," said Henry.


    Mead looked round with dignity, opened his mouth and shut it, opened it
    again, and in his anxiety to oblige Henry, did get on indeed!       to the
    last line of the long speech.

                         "We all expect a gentle answer, Jew."

    The first line and the last line were all that we heard of the Duke's
    speech that night. It must have been the shortest version of it on
    record.


    This was the play with which the Lyceum reopened in the autumn of 1880.
    I was on the last of my provincial tours with Charles Kelly at the time,
    but I must have come up to see the revival, for I remember Henry Irving
    in it very distinctly. He had not played the dual rôle of Louis and
    Fabien del Franchi before, and he had to compete with old playgoers'
    memories of Charles Kean and Fechter. Wisely enough he made of it a
    "period" play, emphasizing its old-fashioned atmosphere. In 1891, when
    the play was revived, the D'Orsay costumes were noticed and considered
    piquant and charming. In 1880 I am afraid they were regarded with
    indifference as merely antiquated.


    The grace and elegance of Henry as the civilized brother I shall never
    forget. There was something in him to which the perfect style of the
    D'Orsay period appealed, and he spoke the stilted language with as much
    truth as he wore the cravat and the tight-waisted full-breasted coats.
    Such lines as       

"'Tis she! Her footstep beats upon my heart!"


    were not absurd from his lips.


    The sincerity of the period, he felt, lay in its elegance. A rough
    movement, a too undeliberate speech, and the absurdity of the thing might be
    given away. It was in fact given away by Terriss at
    Château-Renaud, who was not the smooth, graceful, courteous villain that
    Alfred Wigan had been and that Henry wanted. He told me that he paid
    Miss Fowler, an actress who in other respects was not very remarkable,
    an enormous salary because she could look the high-bred lady of elegant
    manners.


    It was in "The Corsican Brothers" that tableau curtains were first used
    at the Lyceum. They were made of red plush, which suited the old
    decoration of the theater. Those who only saw the Lyceum after its
    renovation in 1881 do not realize perhaps that before that date it was
    decorated in dull gold and dark crimson, and had funny boxes with high
    fronts like old-fashioned church pews. One of these boxes was rented
    annually by the Baroness Burdett-Coutts. It was rather like the toy
    cardboard theater which children used to be able to buy for sixpence.
    The effect was somber, but I think I liked it better than the cold,
    light, shallow, bastard Pompeian decoration of later days.


    In Hallam Tennyson's life of his father, I find that I described "The
    Cup" as a "great little play." After thirty years (nearly) I stick to
    that. Its chief fault was that it was not long enough, for it involved a
    tremendous production, tremendous acting, had all the heroic size of
    tragedy, and yet was all over so quickly that we could play a long play
    like "The Corsican Brothers" with it in a single evening.


          

    
    

          

    ELLEN TERRY AS CAMMA IN       THE CUP      
    ELLEN TERRY AS IOLANTHE

          

    Tennyson read the play to us at Eaton Place. There were present Henry
    Irving, Ellen Terry, William Terriss, Mr. Knowles, who had arranged the
    reading, my daughter Edy, who was then about nine, Hallam Tennyson,
    and a dog       I think Charlie, for the days of Fussie were not yet.


    Tennyson, like most poets, read in a monotone, rumbling on a low note
    in much the same way that Shelley is said to have screamed in a high
    one. For the women's parts he changed his voice suddenly, climbed up
    into a key which he could not sustain. In spite of this I was beginning
    to think how impressive it all was, when I looked up and saw Edy, who
    was sitting on Henry's knee, looking over his shoulder at young Hallam
    and laughing, and Henry, instead of reproaching her, on the broad grin.
    There was much discussion as to what the play should be called, and as
    to whether the names "Synorix" and "Sinnatus" would be confused.


    "I don't think they will," I said, for I thought this was a very small
    matter for the poet to worry about.


    "I do!" said Edy in a loud clear voice, "I haven't known one from the
    other all the time!"


    "Edy, be good!" I whispered.


    Henry, mischievous as usual, was delighted at Edy's independence, but
    her mother was unutterably ashamed.


    "Leave her alone," said Henry, "she's all right."


    Tennyson at first wanted to call the play "The Senator's Wife," then
    thought of "Sinnatus and Synorix," and finally agreed with us that "The
    Cup" was the best as it was the simplest title.


    The production was one of the most beautiful things that Henry Irving
    ever accomplished. It has been described again and again, but none of
    the descriptions are very successful. There was a vastness, a
    spaciousness of proportion about the scene in the Temple of Artemis
    which I never saw again upon the stage until my own son attempted
    something like it in the Church Scene that he designed for my
    production of "Much Ado About Nothing" in 1903.


    A great deal of the effect was due to the lighting. The gigantic figure
    of the many-breasted Artemis, placed far back in the scene-dock, loomed
    through a blue mist, while the foreground of the picture was in yellow
    light. The thrilling effect always to be gained on the stage by the
    simple expedient of a great number of people doing the same thing in the
    same way at the same moment, was seen in "The Cup," when the stage was
    covered with a crowd of women who raised their arms above their heads
    with a large, rhythmic, sweeping movement and then bowed to the goddess
    with the regularity of a regiment saluting.


    At rehearsals there was one girl who did this movement with peculiar
    grace. She wore a black velveteen dress, although it was very hot
    weather, and I called her "Hamlet." I used to chaff her about wearing
    such a grand dress at rehearsals, but she was never to be seen in any
    other. The girls at the theater told me that she was very poor, and that
    underneath her black velveteen dress, which she wore summer and winter,
    she had nothing but a pair of stockings and a chemise. Not long after
    the first night of "The Cup" she disappeared. I made inquiries about
    her, and found that she was dying in hospital. I went several times to
    see her. She looked so beautiful in the little white bed. Her great
    eyes, black, with weary white lids, used to follow me as I left the
    hospital ward, and I could not always tear myself away from their dumb
    beseechingness, but would turn back and sit down again by the bed. Once
    she asked me if I would leave something belonging to me that she might
    look at until I came again. I took off the amber and coral beads that I
    was wearing at the time and gave them to her. Two days later I had a
    letter from the nurse telling me that poor Hamlet was dead       that just
    before she died, with closed eyes, and gasping for breath, she sent her
    love to her "dear Miss Terry," and wanted me to know that the tall
    lilies I had brought her on my last visit were to be buried with her,
    but that she had wiped the coral and amber beads and put them in
    cotton-wool, to be returned to me when she was dead. Poor "Hamlet"!


    Quite as wonderful as the Temple Scene was the setting of the first act,
    which represented the rocky side of a mountain with a glimpse of a
    fertile table-land and a pergola with vines growing over it at the top.
    The acting in this scene all took place on different levels. The hunt
    swept past on one level; the entrance to the temple was on another. A
    goatherd played upon a pipe. Scenically speaking, it was not Greece, but
    Greece in Sicily, Capri, or some such hilly region.


    Henry Irving was not able to look like the full-lipped, full-blooded
    Romans such as we see in long lines in marble at the British Museum, so
    he conceived his own type of the blend of Roman intellect and sensuality
    with barbarian cruelty and lust. Tennyson was not pleased with him as
    Synorix! How he failed to delight in it as a picture I can't conceive.
    With a pale, pale face, bright red hair, gold armor and a tiger-skin, a
    diabolical expression and very thin crimson lips, Henry looked handsome
    and sickening at the same time. Lechery was written across his
    forehead.


    The first act was well within my means; the second was beyond them, but
    it was very good for me to try and do it. I had a long apostrophe to the
    goddess with my back turned to the audience, and I never tackled
    anything more difficult. My dresses, designed by Mr. Godwin, one of them
    with the toga made of that wonderful material which Arnott had printed,
    were simple, fine and free.


    I wrote to Tennyson's son Hallam after the first night that I knew his
    father would be delighted with Henry's splendid performance, but was
    afraid he would be disappointed in me.

                   "Dear Camma," he answered, "I have given your messages to my father, but believe me, who am not 'common report,' that he will thoroughly appreciate your noble, most beautiful and imaginative rendering of 'Camma.' My father and myself hope to see you soon, but not while this detestable cold weather lasts. We trust that you are not now really the worse for that night of nights.

                  
"With all our best wishes,

                  
"Yours ever sincerely,

                  
"HALLAM TENNYSON."

                  
"I quite agree with you as to H.I.'s Synorix."


    The music of "The Cup" was not up to the level of the rest.
    Lady Winchilsea's setting of "Moon on the field and the foam," written within
    the compass of eight notes, for my poor singing voice, which will not go
    up high nor down low, was effective enough, but the music as a whole was
    too "chatty" for a severe tragedy. One night when I was singing my very
    best:


  
    
      
        
          
            
              
"Moon, bring him home, bring him home,
Safe from the dark and the cold,"

              
            
          
        
      
    
  


    some one in the audience sneezed. Every one burst out laughing, and I
    had to laugh too. I did not even attempt the next line.


    "The Cup" was called a failure, but it ran 125 nights, and every night
    the house was crowded! On the hundredth night I sent Tennyson the Cup
    itself. I had it made in silver from Mr. Godwin's design       a
    three-handled cup, pipkin-shaped, standing on three legs.


    "The Cup" and "The Corsican Brothers" together made the bill too heavy
    and too long, even at a time when we still "rang up" at 7:30; and in the
    April following the production of Tennyson's beautiful tragedy       which I
    think in sheer poetic intensity surpasses "Becket," although it is not
    nearly so good a play       "The Belle's Stratagem" was substituted for "The
    Corsican Brothers." This was the first real rollicking comedy that a
    Lyceum audience had ever seen, and the way they laughed did my heart
    good. I had had enough of tragedy and the horrors by this time, and I
    could have cried with joy at that rare and welcome sight       an audience
    rocking with laughter. On the first night the play opened propitiously
    enough with a loud laugh due to the only accident of the kind that ever
    happened at the Lyceum. The curtain went up before the staff had
    "cleared," and Arnott, Jimmy and the rest were seen running for their
    lives out of the center entrance!


    People said that it was so clever of me to play Camma and Letitia Hardy
    (the comedy part in "The Belle's Stratagem") on the same evening. They
    used to say the same kind thing, "only more so," when Henry played
    Jingle and Matthias in "The Bells." But I never liked doing it. A tour
    de force is always more interesting to the looker-on than to the person
    who is taking part in it. One feels no pride in such an achievement,
    which ought to be possible to any one calling himself an actor.
    Personally, I never play comedy and tragedy on the same night without a
    sense that one is spoiling the other. Harmonies are more beautiful than
    contrasts in acting as in other things       and more difficult, too.


          

    
    

          

    ELLEN TERRY AS LETITIA HARDY IN       THE BELLE'S STRATAGEM      

          

    Henry Irving was immensely funny as Doricourt. We had sort of Beatrice
    and Benedick scenes together, and I began to notice what a lot his
    face did for him. There have only been two faces on the stage in my
    time       his and Duse's.


    My face has never been of much use to me, but my pace has filled the
    deficiency sometimes, in comedy at any rate. In "The Belle's Stratagem"
    the public had face and pace together, and they seemed to like it.


    There was one scene in which I sang "Where are you going to, my pretty
    maid?" I used to act it all the way through and give imitations of
    Doricourt       ending up by chucking him under the chin. The house rose at
    it!


    I was often asked at this time when I went out to a party if I would not
    sing that dear little song from "The Cup." When I said I didn't think it
    would sound very nice without the harp, as it was only a chant on two or
    three notes, some one would say:


    "Well, then, the song in 'The Belle's Stratagem'! That has no
    accompaniment!"


    "No," I used to answer, "but it isn't a song. It's a look here, a
    gesture there, a laugh anywhere, and Henry Irving's face everywhere!"


    Miss Winifred Emery came to us for "The Belle's Stratagem" and played
    the part that I had played years before at the Haymarket. She was
    bewitching, and in her white wig in the ball-room, beautiful as well.
    She knew how to bear herself on the stage instinctively, and could dance
    a minuet to perfection. The daughter of Sam Emery, a great comedian in a
    day of comedians, and the granddaughter of the Emery, it was not
    surprising that she should show aptitude for the stage.


    Mr. Howe was another new arrival in the Lyceum company. He was at his
    funniest as Mr. Hardy in "The Belle's Stratagem." It was not the first
    time that he had played my father in a piece (we had acted father and
    daughter in "The Little Treasure"), and I always called him "Daddy." The
    dear old man was much liked by every one. He had a tremendous pair of
    legs, was bluff and bustling in manner, though courtly too, and cared
    more about gardening than acting. He had a little farm at Isleworth, and
    he was one of those actors who do not allow the longest theatrical
    season to interfere with domesticity and horticulture! Because of his
    stout gaitered legs and his Isleworth estate, Henry called him "the
    agricultural actor." He was a good old port and whisky drinker, but he
    could carry his liquor like a Regency man.


    He was a walking history of the stage. "Yes, my dear," he used to say to
    me, "I was in the original cast of the first performance of 'The Lady of
    Lyons,' which Lord Lytton gave Macready as a present, and I was the
    original François when 'Richelieu' was produced. Lord Lytton wrote this
    part for a lady, but at rehearsal it was found that there was a good
    deal of movement awkward for a lady to do, so I was put into it."


    "What year was it, Daddy?"


    "God bless me, I must think.... It must have been about a year after Her
    Majesty took the throne."


    For forty years and nine months old Mr. Howe had acted at the Haymarket
    Theater! When he was first there, the theater was lighted with oil
    lamps, and when a lamp smoked or went out, one of the servants of the
    theater came on and lighted it up again during the action of the play.


    It was the acting of Edmund Kean in "Richard III." which first filled
    Daddy Howe with the desire to go on the stage. He saw the great actor
    again when he was living in retirement at Richmond       in those last sad
    days when the Baroness Burdett-Coutts (then the rich young heiress, Miss
    Angela Burdett-Coutts), driving up the hill, saw him sitting huddled up
    on one of the public seats and asked if she could do anything for him.


    "Nothing, I think," he answered sadly. "Ah yes, there is one thing. You
    were kind enough the other day to send me some very excellent brandy.
    Send me some more."5


    Of Henry Irving as an actor Mr. Howe once said to me that at first he
    was prejudiced against him because he was so different from the other
    great actors that he had known.


    "'This isn't a bit like Iago,' I said to myself when I first saw him in
    'Othello.' That was at the end of the first act. But he had commanded my
    attention to his innovations. In the second act I found myself deeply
    interested in watching and studying the development of his conception.
    In the third act I was fascinated by his originality. By the end of the
    play I wondered that I could ever have thought that the part ought to be
    played differently."


    Daddy Howe was the first member of the Lyceum company who got a
    reception from the audience on his entrance as a public favorite. He
    remained with us until his death, which took place on our fourth
    American tour in 1893.


    Every one has commended Henry Irving's kindly courtesy in inviting
    Edwin
    Booth to come and play with him at the Lyceum Theater. Booth was having
    a wretched season at the Princess's, which was when he went there a
    theater on the down-grade, and under a thoroughly commercial management.
    The great American actor, through much domestic trouble and bereavement,
    had more or less "given up" things. At any rate he had not the spirit
    which can combat such treatment as he received at the Princess's, where
    the pieces in which he appeared were "thrown" on to the stage with every
    mark of assumption that he was not going to be a success.


          

    
    

          

    EDWIN THOMAS BOOTH

    Yet, although he accepted with gratitude Henry Irving's suggestion that
    he should migrate from the Princess's to the Lyceum and appear there
    three times a week as Othello with the Lyceum company and its manager to
    support him, I cannot be sure that Booth's pride was not more hurt by
    this magnificent hospitality than it ever could have been by disaster.
    It is always more difficult to receive than to give.


    Few people thought of this, I suppose. I did, because I could imagine
    Henry Irving in America in the same situation       accepting the hospitality
    of Booth. Would not he too have been melancholy, quiet, unassertive,
    almost as uninteresting and uninterested as Booth was?


    I saw him first at a benefit performance at Drury Lane. I came to the
    door of the room where Henry was dressing, and Booth was sitting there
    with his back to me.


    "Here's Miss Terry," said Henry as I came round the door. Booth looked
    up at me swiftly. I have never in any face, in any country, seen such
    wonderful eyes. There was a mystery about his appearance and his
    manner       a sort of pride which seemed to say: "Don't try to know me, for
    I am not what I have been." He seemed broken, and devoid of ambition.


    At rehearsal he was very gentle and apathetic. Accustomed to playing
    Othello with stock companies, he had few suggestions to make about the
    stage-management. The part was to him more or less of a monologue.


    "I shall never make you black," he said one morning. "When I take your
    hand I shall have a corner of my drapery in my hand. That will protect
    you."


    I am bound to say that I thought of Mr. Booth's "protection" with some
    yearning the next week when I played Desdemona to Henry's Othello.
    Before he had done with me I was nearly as black as he.


    Booth was a melancholy, dignified Othello, but not great as
    Salvini was
    great. Salvini's Hamlet made me scream with mirth, but his Othello was
    the grandest, biggest, most glorious thing. We often prate of "reserved
    force." Salvini had it, for the simple reason that his was the gigantic
    force which may be restrained because of its immensity. Men have no need
    to dam up a little purling brook. If they do it in acting, it is tame,
    absurd and pretentious. But Salvini held himself in, and still his groan
    was like a tempest, his passion huge.


    The fact is that, apart from Salvini's personal genius, the foreign
    temperament is better fitted to deal with Othello than the English.
    Shakespeare's French and Italians, Greeks and Latins, medievals and
    barbarians, fancifuls and reals, all have a dash of Elizabethan English
    men in them, but not Othello.


    Booth's Othello was very helpful to my Desdemona. It is difficult to
    preserve the simple, heroic blindness of Desdemona to the fact that her
    lord mistrusts her, if her lord is raving and stamping under her nose!
    Booth was gentle in the scenes with Desdemona until the scene where
    Othello overwhelms her with the foul word and destroys her fool's
    paradise. Love does make fools of us all, surely, but I wanted to make
    Desdemona out the fool who is the victim of love and faith; not the
    simpleton, whose want of tact in continually pleading Cassio's cause is
    sometimes irritating to the audience.


    My greatest triumph as Desdemona was not gained with the audience but
    with Henry Irving! He found my endeavors to accept comfort from Iago so
    pathetic that they brought the tears to his eyes. It was the oddest
    sensation when I said "Oh, good Iago, what shall I do to win my lord
    again?" to look up       my own eyes dry, for Desdemona is past crying
    then       and see Henry's eyes at their biggest, luminous, soft and full of
    tears! He was, in spite of Iago and in spite of his power of identifying
    himself with the part, very deeply moved by my acting. But he knew how
    to turn it to his purpose: he obtrusively took the tears with his
    fingers and blew his nose with much feeling, softly and long (so much
    expression there is, by the way, in blowing the nose on the stage), so
    that the audience might think his emotion a fresh stroke of hypocrisy.


    Every one liked Henry's Iago. For the first time in his life he knew
    what it was to win unanimous praise. Nothing could be better, I think,
    than Mr. Walkley's6 description: "Daringly Italian, a true compatriot
    of the Borgias, or rather, better than Italians, that devil incarnate,
    an Englishman Italianate."


    One adored him, devil though he was. He was so full of charm, so
    sincerely the "honest" Iago, peculiarly sympathetic with Othello,
    Desdemona, Roderigo, all of them       except his wife. It was only in the
    soliloquies and in the scenes with his wife that he revealed his devil's
    nature. Could one ever forget those grapes which he plucked in the first
    act, and slowly ate, spitting out the seeds, as if each one represented
    a worthy virtue to be put out of his mouth, as God, according to the
    evangelist, puts out the lukewarm virtues. His Iago and his
    Romeo in
    different ways proved his power to portray Italian passions       the
    passions of lovely, treacherous people, who will either sing you a love
    sonnet or stab you in the back       you are not sure which!


    We played "Othello" for six weeks, three performances a week, to guinea
    stalls, and could have played it longer. Each week Henry and Booth
    changed parts. For both of them it was a change for the worse.


    Booth's Iago seemed deadly commonplace after Henry's. He was always the
    snake in the grass; he showed the villain in all the scenes. He could
    not resist the temptation of making polished and ornate effects.


    Henry Irving's Othello was condemned almost as universally as his Iago
    was praised. For once I find myself with the majority. He screamed and
    ranted and raved       lost his voice, was slow where he should have been
    swift, incoherent where he should have been strong. I could not bear to
    see him in the part. It was painful to me. Yet night after night he
    achieved in the speech to the Senate one of the most superb and
    beautiful bits of acting of his life. It was wonderful. He spoke the
    speech, beaming on Desdemona all the time. The gallantry of the thing is
    indescribable.


    I think his failure as Othello was one of the unspoken bitternesses of
    Henry's life. When I say "failure" I am of course judging him by his own
    standard, and using the word to describe what he was to himself, not
    what he was to the public. On the last night, he rolled up the clothes
    that he had worn as the Moor one by one, carefully laying one garment on
    top of the other, and then, half-humorously and very deliberately said,
    "Never again!" Then he stretched himself with his arms above his head
    and gave a great sigh of relief.


    Mr. Pinero was excellent as Roderigo in this production. He was always
    good in the "silly ass" type of part, and no one could say of him that
    he was playing himself!


    Desdemona is not counted a big part by actresses, but I loved playing
    it. Some nights I played it beautifully. My appearance was right       I was
    such a poor wraith of a thing. But let there be no mistake       it took
    strength to act this weakness and passiveness of Desdemona's. I soon
    found that, like Cordelia, she has plenty of character.


    Reading the play the other day, I studied the opening scene. It is the
    finest opening to a play I know.


    How many times Shakespeare draws fathers and daughters, and how little
    stock he seems to take of mothers! Portia and Desdemona, Cordelia,
    Rosalind and Miranda, Lady Macbeth, Queen Katherine and Hermione,
    Ophelia, Jessica, Hero, and many more are daughters of fathers, but of
    their mothers we hear nothing. My own daughter called my attention to
    this fact quite recently, and it is really a singular fact. Of mothers
    of sons there are plenty of examples: Constance, Volumnia, the Countess
    Rousillon, Gertrude; but if there are mothers of daughters at all, they
    are poor examples, like Juliet's mother and Mrs. Page. I wonder if in
    all the many hundreds of books written on Shakespeare and his plays this
    point has been taken up? I once wrote a paper on the "Letters in
    Shakespeare's Plays," and congratulated myself that they had never been
    made a separate study. The very day after I first read my paper before
    the British Empire Shakespeare League, a lady wrote to me from Oxford
    and said I was mistaken in thinking that there was no other contribution
    to the subject. She enclosed an essay of her own which had either been
    published or read before some society. Probably some one else has dealt
    with Shakespeare's patronage of fathers and neglect of mothers! I often
    wonder what the mothers of Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia were like! I
    think Lear must have married twice.


    This was the first of Henry Irving's great Shakespearean productions.
    "Hamlet" and "Othello" had been mounted with care, but, in spite of
    statements that I have seen to the contrary, they were not true
    reflections of Irving as a producer. In beauty I do not think that
    "Romeo and Juliet" surpassed "The Cup," but it was very sumptuous,
    impressive and Italian. It was the most elaborate of all the Lyceum
    productions. In it Henry first displayed his mastery of crowds. The
    brawling of the rival houses in the streets, the procession of girls to
    wake Juliet on her wedding morning, the musicians, the magnificent
    reconciliation of the two houses which closed the play, every one on the
    stage holding a torch, were all treated with a marvelous sense of
    pictorial effect.


    Henry once said to me: "'Hamlet' could be played anywhere on its acting
    merits. It marches from situation to situation. But 'Romeo and Juliet'
    proceeds from picture to picture. Every line suggests a picture. It is a
    dramatic poem rather than a drama, and I mean to treat it from that
    point of view."


    While he was preparing the production he revived "The Two Roses," a
    company in which as Digby Grant he had made a great success years
    before. I rehearsed the part of Lottie two or three times, but Henry
    released me because I was studying Juliet; and as he said, "You've got
    to do all you know with it."


    Perhaps the sense of this responsibility weighed on me. Perhaps I was
    neither young enough nor old enough to play Juliet. I read everything
    that had ever been written about her before I had myself decided what
    she was. It was a dreadful mistake. That was the first thing wrong with
    my Juliet       lack of original impulse.


    As for the second and the third and the fourth       well, I am not more
    than common vain, I trust, but I see no occasion to write them all
    down.


    It was perhaps the greatest opportunity that I had yet had at the
    Lyceum. I studied the part at my cottage at Hampton Court in a bedroom
    looking out over the park. There was nothing wrong with that. By the
    way, how important it is to be careful about environment and everything
    else when one is studying. One ought to be in the country, but not all
    the time.... It is good to go about and see pictures, hear music, and
    watch everything. One should be very much alone, and should study early
    and late       all night, if need be, even at the cost of sleep. Everything
    that one does or thinks or sees will have an effect upon the part,
    precisely as on an unborn child.


    I wish now that instead of reading how this and that actress had played
    Juliet, and cracking my brain over the different readings of her lines
    and making myself familiar with the different opinions of philosophers
    and critics, I had gone to Verona, and just imagined. Perhaps the most
    wonderful description of Juliet, as she should be acted, occurs in
    Gabriele d'Annunzio's "Il Fuoco." In the book an Italian actress tells
    her friend how she played the part when she was a girl of fourteen in an
    open-air theater near Verona. Could a girl of fourteen play such a part?
    Yes, if she were not youthful, only young with the youth of the poet,
    tragically old as some youth is.


    Now I understand Juliet better. Now I know how she should be played. But
    time is inexorable. At sixty, know what one may, one cannot play Juliet.


    I know that Henry Irving's production of "Romeo and Juliet" has been
    attributed to my ambition. What nonsense! Henry Irving now had in view
    the production of all Shakespeare's actable plays, and naturally "Romeo
    and Juliet" would come as early as possible in the programme.


    The music was composed by Sir Julius Benedict, and was exactly right.
    There was no leit-motiv, no attempt to reflect the passionate emotion
    of the drama, but a great deal of Southern joy, of flutes and wood and
    wind. At a rehearsal which had lasted far into the night I asked Sir
    Julius, who was very old, if he wasn't sleepy.


    "Sleepy! Good heavens, no! I never sleep more than two hours. It's the
    end of my life, and I don't want to waste it in sleep!"


    There is generally some "old 'un" in a company now who complains of
    insufficient rehearsals, and says, perhaps, "Think of Irving's
    rehearsals! They were the real thing." While we were rehearsing "Romeo
    and Juliet" I remember that Mrs. Stirling, a charming and ripe old
    actress whom Henry had engaged to play the nurse, was always groaning
    out that she had not rehearsed enough.


    "Oh, these modern ways!" she used to say. "We never have any rehearsals
    at all. How am I going to play the Nurse?"


    She played it splendidly       indeed, she as the Nurse and old
    Tom Mead as
    the Apothecary       the two "old 'uns" romped away with chief honors, had
    the play all to nothing.


    I had one battle with Mrs. Stirling over "tradition." It was in the
    scene beginning       


  
    
      
        
          
            
"The clock struck twelve when I did send the nurse,
And yet she is not here...."

            
          
        
      
    
  


    Tradition said that Juliet must go on coquetting and clicking over the
    Nurse to get the news of Romeo out of her. Tradition said that Juliet
    must give imitations of the Nurse on the line "Where's your mother?" in
    order to get that cheap reward, "a safe laugh." I felt that it was
    wrong. I felt that Juliet was angry with the Nurse. Each time she
    delayed in answering I lost my temper, with genuine passion. At "Where's
    your mother?" I spoke with indignation, tears and rage. We were a long
    time coaxing Mrs. Stirling to let the scene be played on these lines,
    but this was how it was played eventually.


    She was the only Nurse that I have ever seen who did not play the part
    like a female pantaloon. She did not assume any great decrepitude. In
    the "Cords" scene, where the Nurse tells Juliet of the death of Paris,
    she did not play for comedy at all, but was very emotional. Her parrot
    scream when she found me dead was horribly real and effective.


    Years before I had seen Mrs. Stirling act at the Adelphi with
    Benjamin
    Webster, and had cried out: "That's my idea of an actress!" In those
    days she was playing Olivia (in a version of the "Vicar of Wakefield" by
    Tom Taylor), Peg Woffington, and other parts of the kind. She swept on
    to the stage and in that magical way, never, never to be learned,
    filled it. She had such breadth of style, such a lovely voice, such a
    beautiful expressive eye! When she played the Nurse at the Lyceum her
    voice had become a little jangled and harsh, but her eye was still
    bright and her art had not abated       not one little bit! Nor had her
    charm. Her smile was the most fascinating, irresistible thing
    imaginable.


    The production was received with abuse by the critics. It was one of our
    failures, yet it ran a hundred and fifty nights!


    Henry Irving's Romeo had more bricks thrown at it even than my Juliet! I
    remember that not long after we opened, a well-known politician who had
    enough wit and knowledge of the theater to have taken a more original
    view, came up to me and said:


    "I say, E.T., why is Irving playing Romeo?"


    I looked at his distraught. "You should ask me why I am playing Juliet!
    Why are we any of us doing what we have to do?"


    "Oh, you're all right. But Irving!"


    "I don't agree with you," I said. I was growing a little angry by this
    time. "Besides, who would you have play Romeo?"


    "Well, it's so obvious. You've got Terriss in the cast."


    "Terriss!"


    "Yes. I don't doubt Irving's intellectuality, you know. As Romeo he
    reminds me of a pig who has been taught to play the fiddle. He does it
    cleverly, but he would be better employed in squealing. He cannot shine
    in the part like the fiddler. Terriss in this case is the fiddler."


    I was furious. "I am sorry you don't realize," I said, "that the worst
    thing Henry Irving could do would be better than the best of any one
    else."


    When dear Terris did play Romeo at the Lyceum two or three years later
    to the Juliet of Mary Anderson, he attacked the part with a good deal of
    fire. He was young, truly, and stamped his foot a great deal, was
    vehement and passionate. But it was so obvious that there was no
    intelligence behind his reading. He did not know what the part was
    about, and all the finer shades of meaning in it he missed. Yet the
    majority, with my political friend, would always prefer a Terriss as
    Romeo to a Henry Irving.


    I am not going to say that Henry's Romeo was good. What I do say is that
    some bits of it were as good as anything he ever did. In the big
    emotional scene (in the Friar's cell), he came to grief precisely as he
    had done in Othello. He screamed, grew slower and slower, and looked
    older and older. When I begin to think it over I see that he often
    failed in such scenes through his very genius for impersonation. An
    actor of commoner mould takes such scenes rhetorically       recites them,
    and gets through them with some success. But the actor who impersonates,
    feels, and lives such anguish or passion or tempestuous grief, does for
    the moment in imagination nearly die. Imagination impeded Henry Irving
    in what are known as "strong" scenes.


    He was a perfect Hamlet, a perfect Richard III., a perfect Shylock,
    except in the scene with Tubal, where I think his voice failed him. He
    was an imperfect Romeo; yet, as I have said, he did things in the part
    which were equal to the best of his perfect Hamlet.


    His whole attitude before he met Juliet was beautiful. He came on from
    the very back of the stage and walked over a little bridge with a book
    in his hand, sighing and dying for Rosaline. In Iago he had been
    Italian. Then it was the Italy of Venice. As Romeo it was the Italy of
    Tuscany. His clothes were as Florentine as his bearing. He ignored the
    silly tradition that Romeo must wear a feather in his cap. In the course
    of his study of the part he had found that the youthful fops and
    gallants of the period put in their hats anything that they had been
    given       some souvenir "dallying with the innocence of love." And he wore
    in his hat a sprig of crimson oleander.


    It is not usual, I think, to make much of the Rosaline episode. Henry
    Irving chose with great care a tall dark girl to represent Rosaline at
    the ball. Can I ever forget his face when suddenly in pursuit of her
    he saw me.... Once more I reflect that a face is the chiefest
    equipment of the actor.


    I know they said he looked too old       was too old for Romeo. In some
    scenes he looked aged as only a very young man can look. He was not
    boyish; but ought Romeo to be boyish?


    I am not supporting the idea of an elderly Romeo. When it came to the
    scenes where Romeo "poses" and is poetical but insincere, Henry did
    seem elderly. He couldn't catch the youthful pose of melancholy with its
    extravagant expression. It was in the repressed scenes, where the
    melancholy was sincere, the feeling deeper, and the expression slighter,
    that he was at his best.


    "He may be good, but he isn't Romeo," is a favorite type of criticism.
    But I have seen Duse and Bernhardt in "La Dame aux Camélias," and cannot
    say which is Marguerite Gauthier. Each has her own view of the
    character, and each is it according to her imagination.


    According to his imagination, Henry Irving was Romeo.


    Again in this play he used his favorite "fate" tree. It gloomed over the
    street along which Romeo went to the ball. It was in the scene with the
    Apothecary. Henry thought that it symbolized the destiny hanging over
    the lovers.


    It is usual for Romeo to go in to the dead body of Juliet lying in
    Capulet's monument through a gate on the level, as if the Capulets
    were buried but a few feet from the road. At rehearsals Henry Irving
    kept on saying: "I must go down to the vault." After a great deal of
    consideration he had an inspiration. He had the exterior of the vault in
    one scene, the entrance to it down a flight of steps. Then the scene
    changed to the interior of the vault, and the steps now led from a
    height above the stage. At the close of the scene, when the Friar and
    the crowd came rushing down into the tomb, these steps were thronged
    with people, each one holding a torch, and the effect was magnificent.


    At the opening of the Apothecary Scene, when Balthazar comes to tell
    Romeo of Juliet's supposed death, Henry was marvelous. His face grew
    whiter and whiter.


  
    
      
        
          
            
"Then she is well and nothing can be ill;
Her body sleeps in Capulet's monument."

            
          
        
      
    
  


    It was during the silence after those two lines that Henry Irving as
    Romeo had one of those sublime moments which an actor only achieves once
    or twice in his life. The only thing that I ever saw to compare with it
    was Duse's moment when she took Kellner's card in "Magda." There was
    absolutely no movement, but her face grew white, and the audience knew
    what was going on in her soul, as she read the name of the man who years
    before had seduced and deserted her.


    As Juliet I did not look right. My little daughter Edy, a born
    archaeologist, said: "Mother, you oughtn't to have a fringe." Yet,
    strangely enough, Henry himself liked me as Juliet. After the first
    night, or was it the dress rehearsal       I am not quite clear which       he
    wrote to me that "beautiful as Portia was, Juliet leaves her far, far
    behind. Never anybody acted more exquisitely the part of the performance
    which I saw from the front. 'Hie to high fortune,' and 'Where spirits
    resort' were simply incomparable.... Your mother looked very radiant
    last night. I told her how proud she should be, and she was.... The play
    will be, I believe, a mighty 'go,' for the beauty of it is bewildering.
    I am sure of this, for it dumbfounded them all last night. Now
    you       we       must make our task a delightful one by doing everything
    possible to make our acting easy and comfortable. We are in for a long
    run."


          

    
    

          

    ELLEN TERRY AS JULIET

          

    To this letter he added a very human postscript: "I have determined not
    to see a paper for a week       I know they'll cut me up, and I don't like
    it!"


    Yes, he was cut up, and he didn't like it, but a few people knew. One
    of them was Mr. Frankfort Moore, the novelist, who wrote to me of this
    "revealing Romeo, full of originality and power."


    "Are you affected by adverse criticism?" I was asked once. I answered
    then and I answer now, that legitimate adverse criticism has always been
    of use to me if only because it "gave me to think" furiously. Seldom
    does the outsider, however talented, as a writer and observer, recognize
    the actor's art, and often we are told that we are acting best when we
    are showing the works most plainly, and denied any special virtue when
    we are concealing our method. Professional criticism is most helpful,
    chiefly because it induces one to criticize oneself. "Did I give that
    impression to anyone? Then there must have been something wrong
    somewhere." The "something" is often a perfectly different blemish from
    that to which the critic drew attention.


    Unprofessional criticism is often more helpful still, but alas! one's
    friends are to one's faults more than a little blind, and to one's
    virtues very kind! It is through letters from people quite unknown to me
    that I have sometimes learned valuable lessons. During the run of "Romeo
    and Juliet" some one wrote and told me that if the dialogue at the ball
    could be taken in a lighter and quicker way, it would better express
    the manner of a girl of Juliet's age. The same unknown critic pointed
    out that I was too slow and studied in the Balcony Scene. She       I think
    it was a woman       was perfectly right.


    On the hundredth night, although no one liked my Juliet very much, I
    received many flowers, little tokens, and poems. To one bouquet was
    pinned a note which ran:


  
    
      
        
          
            
                   "To JULIET,
                               As a mark of respect and Esteem
                                           From the Gasmen of the Lyceum Theater."

            
          
        
      
    
  


    That alone would have made my recollections of "Romeo and Juliet"
    pleasant. But there was more. At the supper on the stage after the
    hundredth performance, Sarah Bernhardt was present. She said nice things
    to me, and I was enraptured that my "vraies larmes" should have pleased
    and astonished her! I noticed that she hardly ever moved, yet all the
    time she gave the impression of swift, butterfly movement. While
    talking to Henry she took some red stuff out of her bag and rubbed it on
    her lips! This frank "making-up" in public was a far more astonishing
    thing in the 'eighties than it would be now. But I liked Miss Sarah for
    it, as I liked her for everything.


    How wonderful she looked in those days! She was as transparent as an
    azalea, only more so; like a cloud, only not so thick. Smoke from a
    burning paper describes her more nearly! She was hollow-eyed, thin,
    almost consumptive-looking. Her body was not the prison of her soul, but
    its shadow.


    On the stage she has always seemed to me more a symbol, an ideal, an
    epitome than a woman. It is this quality which makes her so easy in
    such lofty parts as Phèdre. She is always a miracle. Let her play
    "L'Aiglon," and while matter-of-fact members of the audience are
    wondering if she looks really like the unfortunate King of Rome, and
    deciding against her and in favor of Maude Adams who did look the boy to
    perfection, more imaginative watchers see in Sarah's performance a truth
    far bigger than a mere physical resemblance. Rostand says in the
    foreword to his play, that in it he does not espouse this cause or that,
    but only tells the story of "one poor little boy." In another of his
    plays, "Cyrano de Bergerac," there is one poor little tune played on a
    pipe of which the hero says:

"Écoutez, Gascons, c'est toute la Gascogne."


    Though I am not French, and know next to nothing of the language, I
    thought when I saw Sarah's "L'Aiglon," that of that one poor little boy
    too might be said:

"Écoutez, Français, c'est toute la France!"


    It is this extraordinary decorative and symbolic quality of Sarah's
    which makes her transcend all personal and individual feeling on the
    stage. No one plays a love scene better, but it is a picture of love
    that she gives, a strange orchidaceous picture rather than a suggestion
    of the ordinary human passion as felt by ordinary human people. She is
    exotic       well, what else should she be? One does not, at any rate one
    should not, quarrel with an exquisite tropical flower and call it
    unnatural because it is not a buttercup or a cowslip.


    I have spoken of the face as the chief equipment of the actor. Sarah
    Bernhardt contradicts this at once. Her face does little for her. Her
    walk is not much. Nothing about her is more remarkable than the way she
    gets about the stage without one ever seeing her move. By what magic
    does she triumph without two of the richest possessions that an actress
    can have? Eleonora Duse has them. Her walk is the walk of the peasant,
    fine and free. She has the superb carriage of the head which goes with
    that fearless movement from the hips       and her face! There is nothing
    like it, nothing! But it is as the real woman, a particular woman, that
    Duse triumphs most. Her Cleopatra was insignificant compared with
    Sarah's       she is not so pictorial.


    How futile it is to make comparisons! Better far to thank heaven for
    both these women.


  
EXTRACT FROM MY DIARY


                        Saturday, June 11, 1892.       "To see 'Miss Sarah' as 'Cléopâtre' (Sardou superb!). She was inspired! The essence of Shakespeare's 'Cleopatra.' I went round and implored her to do Juliet. She said she was too old. She can never be old. 'Age cannot wither her.'


                        June 18.       "Again to see Sarah       this time 'La Dame aux Camélias.' Fine, marvelous. Her writing the letter, and the last act the best.


                        July 11.       "Telegraph says 'Frou-frou' was 'never at any time a character in which she (Sarah) excelled.' Dear me! When I saw it I thought it wonderful. It made me ashamed of ever having played it."

  


    Sarah Bernhardt has shown herself the equal of any man as a manager. Her
    productions are always beautiful; she chooses her company with
    discretion, and sees to every detail of the stage-management. In this
    respect she differs from all other foreign artists that I have seen. I
    have always regretted that Duse should play as a rule with such a
    mediocre company and should be apparently so indifferent to her
    surroundings. In "Adrienne Lecouvreur" it struck me that the careless
    stage-management utterly ruined the play, and I could not bear to see
    Duse as Adrienne beautifully dressed while the Princess and the other
    Court ladies wore cheap red velveteen and white satin and brought the
    pictorial level of the performance down to that of a "fit-up" or booth.


    Who could mention "Miss Sarah" (my own particular name for her) as being
    present at a supper-party without saying something about her by the way!
    Still, I have been a long time by the way. Now for Romeo and Juliet!


    At that 100th-night celebration I saw Mrs. Langtry in evening dress for
    the first time, and for the first time realized how beautiful she was.
    Her neck and shoulders kept me so busy looking that I could neither
    talk nor listen.


    "Miss Sarah" and I have always been able to understand one another,
    although I hardly know a word of French and her English is scanty. She
    too, liked my Juliet       she and Henry Irving! Well, that was charming,
    although I could not like it myself, except for my "Cords" scene, of
    which I shall always be proud.


    My dresser, Sarah Holland, came to me, I think, during "Romeo and
    Juliet." I never had any other dresser at the Lyceum except Sally's
    sister Lizzie, who dressed me during the first few years. Sally stuck to
    me loyally until the Lyceum days ended. Then she perceived "a divided
    duty." On one side was "the Guv'nor" with "the Guv'nor's" valet Walter,
    to whom she was devoted; on the other was a precarious in and out job
    with me, for after the Lyceum I never knew what I was going to do next.
    She chose to go with Henry, and it was she and Walter who dressed him
    for the last time when he lay dead in the hotel bedroom at Bradford.


          

    
    

          

    SARAH HOLLAND, ELLEN TERRY'S DRESSER

    Sally Holland's two little daughters "walked on" in "Romeo and Juliet."
    Henry always took an interest in the children in the theater, and was
    very kind to them. One night as we came down the stairs from our
    dressing-rooms to go home       the theater was quiet and deserted       we found
    a small child sitting forlornly and patiently on the lowest step.


    "Well, my dear, what are you doing here?" said Henry.


    "Waiting for mother, sir."


    "Are you acting in the theater?"


    "Yes, sir."


    "And what part do you take?"


    "Please, sir, first I'm a water-carrier, then I'm a little page, and
    then I'm a virgin."


    Henry and I sat down on the stairs and laughed until we cried! Little
    Flo Holland was one of the troop of "virgins" who came to wake Juliet on
    her bridal morn. As time went on she was promoted to more important
    parts, but she never made us laugh so much again.


    Her mother was a "character," a dear character. She had an
    extraordinarily open mind, and was ready to grasp each new play as it
    came along as a separate and entirely different field of operations! She
    was also extremely methodical, and only got flurried once in a blue
    moon. When we went to America and made the acquaintance of that dreadful
    thing, a "one-night stand," she was as precise and particular about
    having everything nice and in order for me as if we were going to stay
    in the town a month. Down went my neat square of white drugget; all the
    lights in my dressing-room were arranged as I wished. Everything was
    unpacked and ironed. One day when I came into some American theater to
    dress I found Sally nearly in tears.


    "What's the matter with you, Sally?" I asked.


    "I 'aven't 'ad a morsel to heat all day, dear, and I can't 'eat my
    iron."


    "Eat your iron, Sally! What do you mean?"


    "'Ow am I to iron all this, dear?" wailed Sally, picking up my Nance
    Oldfield apron and a few other trifles. "It won't get 'ot."


    Until then I really thought that Sally was being sardonic about an iron
    as a substitute for victuals!


    When she first began to dress me, I was very thin, so thin that it was
    really a grief to me. Sally would comfort me in my thin days by the
    terse compliment:


    "Beautiful and fat to-night, dear."


    As the years went on and I grew fat, she made a change in the
    compliment:


    "Beautiful and thin to-night, dear."


    Mr. Fernandez played Friar Laurence in "Romeo and Juliet." He was a very
    nervous actor, and it used to paralyze him with fright when I knelt down
    in the friar's cell with my back to the audience and put safety pins in
    the drapery I wore over my head to keep it in position while I said the
    lines,


  
    
      
        
          
            
"Are you at leisure, holy father, now
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?"

            
          
        
      
    
  


    Not long after the production of "Romeo and Juliet" I saw the
    performance of a Greek play       the "Electra," I think       by some Oxford
    students. A young woman veiled in black with bowed head was brought in
    on a chariot. Suddenly she lifted her head and looked round, revealing a
    face of such pure classic beauty and a glance of such pathos that I
    called out:


    "What a supremely beautiful girl!"


    Then I remembered that there were no women in the cast! The face
    belonged to a young Oxford man, Frank Benson.


    We engaged him to play Paris in "Romeo and Juliet," when George
    Alexander, the original Paris, left the Lyceum for a time. Already
    Benson gave promise of turning out quite a different person from the
    others. He had not nearly so much of the actor's instinct as Terriss,
    but one felt that he had far more earnestness. He was easily
    distinguished as a man with a purpose, one of those workers who "scorn
    delights and live laborious days." Those laborious days led him at last
    to the control of two or three companies, all traveling through Great
    Britain playing a Shakespearean répertoire. A wonderful organizer, a
    good actor (oddly enough, the more difficult the part the better he
    is       I like his Lear), and a man who has always been associated with
    high endeavor, Frank Benson's name is honored all over England. He was
    only at the Lyceum for this one production, but he always regarded Henry
    Irving as the source of the good work that he did afterwards.


    "Thank you very much," he wrote to me after his first night as Paris,
    "for writing me a word of encouragement.... I was very much ashamed and
    disgusted with myself all Sunday for my poverty-stricken and thin
    performance.... I think I was a little better last night. Indeed I was
    much touched at the kindness and sympathy of all the company and their
    efforts to make the awkward new boy feel at home.... I feel doubly
    grateful to you and Mr. Irving for the light you shed from the lamp of
    art on life now that I begin to understand the labor and weariness the
    process of trimming the Lamp entails."

    LYCEUM PRODUCTIONS (continued)

          
"MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING" TO "FAUST"
      

    Our success with "The Belle's Stratagem" had pointed to comedy, to
    Beatrice and Benedick in particular, because in Mrs. Cowley's old comedy
    we had had some scenes of the same type. I have already told of my first
    appearance as Beatrice at Leeds, and said that I never played the part
    so well again; but the Lyceum production was a great success, and
    Beatrice a great personal success for me. It is only in high comedy that
    people seem to know what I am driving at!


          

    
    

          

    TWO PORTRAITS OF ELLEN TERRY AS BEATRICE

    From the collection of Miss Frances Johnston

          

    The stage-management of the play was very good; the scenery nothing out
    of the ordinary except for the Church Scene. There was no question that
    it was a church, hardly a question that old Mead was a Friar. Henry
    had the art of making ceremonies seem very real.


    This was the first time that we engaged a singer from outside. Mr. Jack
    Robertson came into the cast to sing "Sigh no more, ladies," and made an
    enormous success.


    Johnston Forbes-Robertson made his first appearance at the Lyceum as
    Claudio. I had not acted with him since "The Wandering Heir," and his
    improvement as an actor in the ten years that had gone by since then was
    marvelous. I had once said to him that he had far better stick to his
    painting and become an artist instead of an actor. His Claudio made me
    "take it back." It was beautiful. I have seen many young actors play the
    part since then, but not one of them made it anywhere near as
    convincing. Forbes-Robertson put a touch of Leontes into it, a part
    which some years later he was to play magnificently, and through the
    subtle indication of consuming and insanely suspicious jealousy made
    Claudio's offensive conduct explicable at least. On the occasion of the
    performance at Drury Lane which the theatrical profession organized in
    1906 in honor of my Stage Jubilee, one of the items in the programme was
    a scene from "Much Ado about Nothing." I then played Beatrice for the
    last time and Forbes-Robertson played his old part of Claudio.


    During the run Henry commissioned him to paint a picture of the Church
    Scene, which was hung in the Beefsteak Room. The engravings printed from
    it were at one time very popular. When Johnston was asked why he had
    chosen that particular moment in the Church Scene, he answered modestly
    that it was the only moment when he could put himself as Claudio at the
    "side"! Some of the other portraits in the picture are Henry Irving,
    Terriss, who played Don Pedro; Jessie Millward as Hero, Mr. Glenny as
    Don John, Miss Amy Coleridge, Miss Harwood, Mr. Mead, and his daughter
    "Charley" Mead, a pretty little thing who was one of the pages.


    The Lyceum company was not a permanent one. People used to come, learn
    something, go away, and come back at a larger salary! Miss Emery left
    for a time, and then returned to play Hero and other parts. I liked her
    Hero better than Miss Millward's. Miss Millward had a sure touch;
    strength, vitality, interest; but somehow she was commonplace in the
    part.


    Henry used to spend hours and hours teaching people. I used to think
    impatiently: "Acting can't be taught." Gradually I learned to modify
    this conviction and to recognize that there are two classes of actors:


    1. Those who can only do what they are taught.


    2. Those who cannot be taught, but can be helped by suggestion to work
    out things for themselves.


    Henry said to me once: "What makes a popular actor? Physique! What makes
    a great actor? Imagination and sensibility." I tried to believe it. Then
    I thought to myself: "Henry himself is not quite what is understood by
    'an actor of physique,' and certainly he is popular. And that he is a
    great actor I know. He certainly has both imagination and 'sense and
    sensibility.'" After the lapse of years I begin to wonder if Henry was
    ever really popular. It was natural to most people to dislike his
    acting       they found it queer, as some find the painting of Whistler       but
    he forced them, almost against their will and nature, out of dislike
    into admiration. They had to come up to him, for never would he go down
    to them. This is not popularity.


    Brain allied with the instinct of the actor tells, but stupidity
    allied with the instinct of the actor tells more than brain alone. I
    have sometimes seen a clever man who was not a born actor play a small
    part with his brains, and have felt that the cleverness was telling more
    with the actors on the stage than with the audience.


    Terriss, like Mrs. Pritchard, if we are to believe what Dr. Johnson said
    of her, often did not know what on earth he was talking about! One
    morning we went over and over one scene in "Much Ado"       at least a dozen
    times I should think       and each time when Terriss came to the speech
    beginning:

"What needs the bridge much broader than the flood,"


    he managed to give a different emphasis. First it would be:


    "What! Needs the bridge much broader than the flood!" Then:


    "What needs the bridge much broader than the flood."


    After he had been floundering about for some time, Henry said:


    "Terriss, what's the meaning of that?"


    "Oh, get along, Guv'nor, you know!"


    Henry laughed. He never could be angry with Terriss, not even when he
    came to rehearsal full of absurd excuses. One day, however, he was so
    late that it was past a joke, and Henry spoke to him sharply.


    "I think you'll be sorry you've spoken to me like this, Guv'nor," said
    Terriss, casting down his eyes.


    "Now no hanky-panky tricks, Terriss."


    "Tricks, Guv'nor! I think you'll regret having said that when you hear
    that my poor mother passed away early this morning."


    And Terriss wept.


    Henry promptly gave him the day off. A few weeks later, when Terriss and
    I were looking through the curtain at the audience just before the play
    began, he said to me gaily:


    "See that dear old woman sitting in the fourth row of stalls       that's my
    dear old mother."


    The wretch had quite forgotten that he had killed her!


    He was the only person who ever ventured to "cheek" Henry, yet he never
    gave offense, not even when he wrote a letter of this kind:

                   "My dear Guv.,       

                  
"I hope you are enjoying yourself, and in the best of health. I very much want to play 'Othello' with you next year (don't laugh). Shall I study it up, and will you do it with me on tour if possible? Say yes, and lighten the drooping heart of yours sincerely,

                  
"WILL TERRISS."


    I have never seen any one at all like Terriss, and my father said the
    same. The only actor of my father's day, he used to tell me, who had a
    touch of the same insouciance and lawlessness was Leigh Murray, a famous
    jeune premier.


    One night he came into the theater soaked from head to foot.


    "Is it raining, Terriss?" said some one who noticed that he was wet.


    "Looks like it, doesn't it?" said Terriss carelessly.


    Later it came out that he had jumped off a penny steamboat into the
    Thames and saved a little girl's life. It was pretty brave, I think.


    Mr. Pinero, who was no longer a member of the Lyceum company when "Much
    Ado" was produced, wrote to Henry after the first night that it was "as
    perfect a representation of a Shakespearean play as I conceive to be
    possible. I think," he added, "that the work at your theater does so
    much to create new playgoers       which is what we want, far more I fancy
    than we want new theaters and perhaps new plays."


    A playgoer whose knowledge of the English stage extended over a period
    of fifty-five years, wrote another nice letter about "Much Ado" which
    was passed on to me because it had some ridiculously nice things about
    me in it.
                   SAVILE CLUB,

                        January 13, 1883.
      
                   "My dear Henry,       

                  
"I were an imbecile ingrate if I did not hasten to give you my warmest thanks for the splendid entertainment of last night. Such a performance is not a grand entertainment merely, or a glorious pastime, although it was all that. It was, too, an artistic display of the highest character, elevating in the vast audience their art instinct       as well as purifying any developed art in the possession of individuals.

                  
"I saw the Kean revivals of 1855-57, and I suppose 'The Winter's Tale' was the best of the lot. But it did not approach last night....

                  
"I was impressed more strongly than ever with the fact that the plays of Shakespeare were meant to be acted. The man who thinks that he can know Shakespeare by reading him is a shallow ass. The best critic and scholar would have been carried out of himself last night into the poet's heart, his mind-spirit.... The Terry was glorious.... The scenes in which she appeared       and she was in eight out of the sixteen       reminded me of nothing but the blessed sun that not only beautifies but creates. But she never acts so well as when I am there to see! That is a real lover's sentiment, and all lovers are vain men.

                  
"Terriss has 'come on' wonderfully, and his Don Pedro is princely and manful.

                  
"I have thus set down, my dear Irving, one or two things merely to show that my gratitude to you is not that of a blind gratified idiot, but of one whose intimate personal knowledge of the English stage entitles him to say what he owes to you."

"A.J. DUFFIELD."


    In 1891, when we revived "Much Ado," Henry's Benedick was far more
    brilliant than it was at first. In my diary, January 5, 1891, I wrote:


  
                   "Revival of 'Much Ado about Nothing.' Went most brilliantly. Henry has vastly improved upon his old rendering of Benedick. Acts larger now       not so 'finicking.' His model (of manner) is the Duke of Sutherland. VERY good. I did some parts better, I think       made Beatrice a nobler woman. Yet I failed to please myself in the Cathedral Scene."


                        Two days later.       "Played the Church Scene all right at last. More of a blaze. The little scene in the garden, too, I did better (in the last act). Beatrice has confessed her love, and is now
     softer. Her voice should be beautiful now, breaking out into playful defiance now and again, as of old. The last scene, too, I made much more merry, happy, soft."


                        January 8.       "I must make Beatrice more flashing at first, and
     softer afterwards. This will be an improvement upon my old reading of the part. She must be always merry and by turns scornful, tormenting, vexed, self-communing, absent, melting, teasing, brilliant, indignant, sad-merry, thoughtful, withering, gentle, humorous, and gay, Gay, Gay! Protecting (to Hero), motherly, very intellectual       a gallant creature and complete in mind and feature."

  


    After a run of two hundred and fifty nights, "Much Ado," although it was
    still drawing fine houses, was withdrawn as we were going to America in
    the autumn (of 1883) and Henry wanted to rehearse the plays that we were
    to do in the States by reviving them in London at the close of the
    summer season. It was during these revivals that I played Janette in "The
    Lyons Mail"       not a big part, and not well suited to me, but I played it
    well enough to support my theory that whatever I have not been, I
    have been a useful actress.


    I always associate "The Lyons Mail" with old Mead, whose performance of
    the father, Jerome Lesurques, was one of the most impressive things
    that this fine actor ever did with us. (Before Henry was ever heard of,
    Mead had played Hamlet at Drury Lane!) Indeed when he "broke up," Henry
    put aside "The Lyons Mail" for many years because he dreaded playing
    Lesurques' scene with his father without Mead.


    In the days just before the break-up, which came about because Mead was
    old, and       I hope there is no harm in saying of him what can be said of
    many men who have done finely in the world       too fond of "the wine when
    it is red," Henry use to suffer great anxiety in the scene, because he
    never knew what Mead was going to do or say next. When Jerome Lesurques
    is forced to suspect his son of crime, he has a line:

"Am I mad, or dreaming? Would I were."


    Mead one night gave a less poetic reading:

"Am I mad or drunk? Would I were!"


    It will be remembered by those who saw the play that Lesurques, an
    innocent man, will not commit the Roman suicide of honor at his father's
    bidding, and refuses to take up his pistol from the table. "What! you
    refuse to die by your own hands, do you?" says the elder Lesurques.
    "Then die like a dog by mine!" (producing a pistol from his pocket).


    One night, after having delivered the line with his usual force and
    impressiveness, Mead, after prolonged fumbling in his coat-tail pockets,
    added another:


    "D       , b              ! God bless my soul! Where's the pistol? I haven't got the
    pistol!"


    The last scene in the eventful history of "Meadisms" in "'The Lyons
    Mail" was when Mead came on to the stage in his own top-hat, went over
    to the sofa, and lay down, apparently for a nap! Not a word could Henry
    get from him, and Henry had to play the scene by himself. He did it in
    this way:


    "You say, father, that I," etc. "I answer you that it is false!"


    Mead had a remarkable foot. Norman Forbes called it an architectural
    foot. Bunions and gout combined to give it a gargoyled effect! One
    night, I forget whether it was in this play or another, Henry, pawing
    the ground with his foot before an "exit"       one of the mannerisms which
    his imitators delighted to burlesque       came down on poor old Mead's foot,
    bunion gargoyles and all! Hardly had Mead stopped cursing under his
    breath than on came Tyars, and brought down his weight heavily on the
    same foot. Directly Tyars came off the stage he looked for Mead in the
    wings and offered an apology.


    "I beg your pardon       I'm really awfully sorry, Mead."


    "Sorry! sorry!" the old man snorted. "It's a d              d conspiracy!"


    It was the dignity and gravity of Mead which made everything he said so
    funny. I am afraid that those who never knew him will wonder where the
    joke comes in.


    I forget what year he left us for good, but in a letter of Henry's dated
    September, 1888, written during a provincial tour of "Faust," when I was
    ill and my sister Marion played Margaret instead of me, I find this
    allusion to him:


    "Wenman does the Kitchen Witch now (I altered it this morning) and Mead
    the old one       the climber. Poor old chap, he'll not climb much longer!"


    This was one of the least successful of Henry's Shakespearean
    productions. Terriss looked all wrong as Orsino; many other people were
    miscast. Henry said to me a few years later when he thought of doing
    "The Tempest," "I can't do it without three great comedians. I ought
    never to have attempted 'Twelfth Night' without them."


    I don't think that I played Viola nearly as well as my sister Kate. Her
    "I am the man" was very delicate and charming. I overdid that. My
    daughter says: "Well, you were far better than any Viola that I have
    seen since, but you were too simple to make a great hit in it. I think
    that if you had played Rosalind the public would have thought you too
    simple in that. Somehow people expect these parts to be acted in a
    'principal boy' fashion, with sparkle and animation."


    We had the curious experience of being "booed" on the first night. It
    was not a comedy audience, and I think the rollickings of Toby Belch and
    his fellows were thought "low." Then people were put out by Henry's
    attempt to reserve the pit. He thought that the public wanted it. When
    he found that it was against their wishes he immediately gave in. His
    pride was the service of the public.


    His speech after the hostile reception of "Twelfth Night" was the only
    mistake that I ever knew him make. He was furious, and showed it.
    Instead of accepting the verdict, he trounced the first-night audience
    for giving it. He simply could not understand it!


    My old friend Rose Leclercq, who was in Charles Kean's company at the
    Princess's when I made my first appearance upon the stage, joined the
    Lyceum company to play Olivia. Strangely enough she had lost the touch
    for the kind of part. She, who had made one of her early successes as
    the spirit of Astarte in "Manfred," was known to a later generation of
    playgoers as the aristocratic dowager of stately presence and incisive
    repartee. Her son, Fuller Mellish, was also in the cast as Curio, and
    when we played "Twelfth Night" in America was promoted to the part of
    Sebastian, my double. In London my brother Fred played it. Directly he
    walked on to the stage, looking as like me as possible, yet a man all
    over, he was a success. I don't think that I have ever seen anything so
    unmistakable and instantaneous.


    In America "Twelfth Night" was liked far better than in London, but I
    never liked it. I thought our production dull, lumpy and heavy.
    Henry's Malvolio was fine and dignified, but not good for the play, and I never
    could help associating my Viola with physical pain. On the first night I
    had a bad thumb       I thought it was a whitlow       and had to carry my arm in
    a sling. It grew worse every night, and I felt so sick and faint from
    pain that I played most of my scenes sitting in a chair. One night
    Dr.
    Stoker, Bram Stoker's brother, came round between the scenes, and, after
    looking at my thumb, said:


    "Oh, that'll be all right. I'll cut it for you."


    He lanced it then and there, and I went on with my part for that
    night. George Stoker, who was just going off to Ireland, could not see
    the job through, but the next day I was in for the worst illness I ever
    had in my life. It was blood-poisoning, and the doctors were in doubt
    for a little as to whether they would not have to amputate my arm. They
    said that if George Stoker had not lanced the thumb that minute, I
    should have lost my arm.


    A disagreeable incident in connection with my illness was that a member
    of my profession made it the occasion of an unkind allusion (in a speech
    at the Social Science Congress) to "actresses who feign illness and have
    straw laid down before their houses, while behind the drawn blinds they
    are having riotous supper-parties, dancing the can-can and drinking
    champagne." Upon being asked for "name," the speaker would neither
    assert nor deny that it was Ellen Terry (whose poor arm at the time was
    as big as her waist, and that has never been very small!) that she
    meant.


    I think we first heard of the affair on our second voyage to America,
    during which I was still so ill that they thought I might never see
    Quebec, and Henry wrote a letter to the press       a "scorcher." He showed
    it to me on the boat. When I had read it, I tore it up and threw the
    bits into the sea.


    "It hasn't injured me in any way," I said. "Any answer would be
    undignified."


    Henry did what I wished in the matter, but, unlike me, whose heart I am
    afraid is of wax       no impression lasts long       he never forgot it, and
    never forgave. If the speech-maker chanced to come into a room where he
    was       he walked out. He showed the same spirit in the last days of his
    life, long after our partnership had come to an end. A literary club,
    not a hundred yards from Hyde Park Corner, "blackballed"' me (although I
    was qualified for election under the rules) for reasons with which I was
    never favored. The committee, a few months later, wished Henry Irving to
    be the guest of honor at one of the club dinners. The honor was
    declined.


    The first night of "Olivia" at the Lyceum was about the only
    comfortable first night that I have ever had! I was familiar with the
    part, and two of the cast, Terriss and Norman Forbes, were the same as
    at the Court, which made me feel all the more at home. Henry left a
    great deal of the stage-management to us, for he knew that he could not
    improve on Mr. Hare's production. Only he insisted on altering the last
    act, and made a bad matter worse. The division into two scenes wasted
    time, and nothing was gained by it. Never obstinate, Henry saw his
    mistake and restored the original end after a time. It was weak and
    unsatisfactory but not pretentious and bad like the last act he
    presented at the first performance.

          

    
    

          

    ELLEN TERRY'S FAVOURITE PHOTOGRAPH AS OLIVIA

    From the collection of Miss Evelyn Smalley

          

    We took the play too slowly at the Lyceum. That was often a fault there.
    Because Henry was slow, the others took their time from him, and the
    result was bad.


    The lovely scene of the vicarage parlor, in which we used a harpsichord
    and were accused of pedantry for our pains, did not look so well at the
    Lyceum as at the Court. The stage was too big for it.


    The critics said that I played Olivia better at the Lyceum, but I did
    not feel this myself.


    At first Henry did not rehearse the Vicar at all well. One day when he
    was stamping his foot very much, as if he was Matthias in "The Bells,"
    my little Edy, who was a terrible child and a wonderful critic, said:


    "Don't go on like that, Henry. Why don't you talk as you do to me and
    Teddy? At home you are the Vicar."


    The child's frankness did not offend Henry, because it was illuminating.
    A blind man had changed his Shylock; a little child changed his Vicar.
    When the first night came he gave a simple, lovable performance. Many
    people now understood and liked him as they had never done before. One
    of the things I most admired in it was his sense of the period.


    In this, as in other plays, he used to make his entrance in the skin
    of the part. No need for him to rattle a ladder at the side to get up
    excitement and illusion as Macready is said to have done. He walked on,
    and was the simple-minded old clergyman, just as he had walked on a
    prince in "Hamlet," a king in "Charles I.," and a saint in "Becket."


    A very handsome woman, descended from Mrs. Siddons and looking exactly
    like her, played the gipsy in "Olivia." The likeness was of no use,
    because the possessor of it had no talent. What a pity!


    "Olivia" has always been a family play. Edy and Ted walked on the stage
    for the first time in the Court "Olivia." In later years Ted played
    Moses and Edy made her first appearance in a speaking part as Polly
    Flamborough, and has since played both Sophia and the Gipsy. My brother
    Charlie's little girl Beatrice made her first appearance as Bill, my
    sister Floss played Olivia on a provincial tour, and my sister Marion
    played it at the Lyceum when I was ill.


    I saw Floss play it, and took from her a lovely and sincere bit of
    "business." In the third act, where the Vicar has found his erring
    daughter and has come to take her away from the inn, I had always
    hesitated at my entrance as if I were not quite sure what reception my
    father would give me after what had happened. Floss in the same
    situation came running in and went straight to her father, quite sure
    of his love if not of his forgiveness.


    I did not take some business which Marion did on Terriss's suggestion.
    Where Thornhill tells Olivia that she is not his wife, I used to thrust
    him away with both hands as I said       "Devil!"


    "It's very good, Nell, very fine," said Terriss to me, "but believe me,
    you miss a great effect there. You play it grandly, of course, but at
    that moment you miss it. As you say 'Devil!' you ought to strike me full
    in the face."


    "Oh, don't be silly, Terriss," I said, "she's not a pugilist."


    Of course I saw, apart from what was dramatically fit, what would
    happen.


    However Marion, very young, very earnest, very dutiful, anxious to
    please Terriss, listened eagerly to the suggestion during an understudy
    rehearsal.


    "No one could play this part better than your sister Nell," said Terriss
    to the attentive Marion, "but as I always tell her, she does miss one
    great effect. When Olivia says 'Devil!' she ought to hit me bang in the
    face."


    "Thank you for telling me," said Marion gratefully.


    "It will be much more effective," said Terriss.


    It was. When the night came for Marion to play the part, she struck out,
    and Terriss had to play the rest of the scene with a handkerchief held
    to his bleeding nose!


    I think it was as Olivia that Eleonora Duse first saw me act. She had
    thought of playing the part herself some time, but she said: "Never
    now!" No letter about my acting ever gave me the same pleasure as this
    from her:

                   "Madame,       Avec Olivia vous m'avez donné bonheur et peine. Bonheur part votre art qui est noble et sincère ... peine car je sens la tristesse au coeur quand je vois une belle et généreuse nature de femme, donner son âme à l'art       comme vous le faites       quand c'est la vie même, votre coeur même qui parle tendrement, douleureusement, noblement sous votre jeu. Je ne puis me débarrasser d'une certaine tristesse quand je vois des artistes si nobles et hauts tels que vous et Irving.... Si vous êtes si forts de soumettre (avec un travail continu) la vie à l'art, il faut done vous admirer comme des forces de la nature même qui auraient pourtant le droit de vivre pour elles-mêmes et non pour la foule. Je n'ose pas vous déranger, Madame, et d'ailleurs j'ai tant à faire aussi qu'il m'est impossible de vous dire de vive voix tout le grand plaisir que vous m'avez donné, mais puisque j'ai senti votre coeur, veuillez, chère Madame, croire au mien qui ne demande pas mieux dans cet instant que de vous admirer et de vous le dire tant bien que mal d'une manière quelconque. Bien à vous.

                  
"E. DUSE."


    When I wrote to Madame Duse the other day to ask her permission to
    publish this much-prized letter, she answered:

                   BUENOS AYRES,

                        Septembre 11, 1907.

                  
"Chère Ellen Terry,       

                  
"Au milieu du travail en Amérique, je reçois votre lettre envoyée à Florence.

                  
"Vous me demandez de publier mon ancienne lettre amicale. Oui, chère Ellen Terry; ce que j'ai donné vous appartient; ce que j'ai dit, je le peux encore, et je vous aime et admire comme toujours....

                  
"J'espère que vous accepterez cette ancienne lettre que j'ai rendue plus claire et un peu mieux écrite. Vous en serez contente avec moi car, ainsi faisant, j'ai eu le moyen de vous dire que je vous aime et de vous le dire deux fois.

                  
"A vous de coeur,

                  
"E. DUSE."


    Dear, noble Eleanora Duse, great woman, great artist       I can never
    appreciate you in words, but I store the delight that you have given me
    by your work, and the personal kindness that you have shown me, in the
    treasure-house of my heart!


          

    
    

          

    ELEANORA DUSE WITH LENBACH'S CHILD

    From the painting by Franz von Lenbach

          

    When I celebrated my stage jubilee you traveled all the way from Italy
    to support me on the stage at Drury Lane. When you stood near me,
    looking so beautiful with wings in your hair, the wings of glory they
    seemed to me, I could not thank you, but we kissed each other and you
    understood!


    "Clap-trap" was the verdict passed by many on the Lyceum "Faust," yet
    Margaret was the part I liked better than any other       outside
    Shakespeare. I played it beautifully sometimes. The language was often
    very commonplace       not nearly as poetic or dramatic as that of "Charles
    I."       but the character was all right       simple, touching, sublime.


    The Garden Scene I know was unsatisfactory. It was a bad, weak
    love-scene, but George Alexander as Faust played it admirably. Indeed he
    always acted like an angel with me; he was so malleable, ready to do
    anything. He was launched into the part at very short notice, after
    H.B.
    Conway's failure on the first night. Poor Conway! It was
    Coghlan as
    Shylock all over again.


    Henry called a rehearsal the next day       on Sunday, I think. The company
    stood about in groups on the stage while Henry walked up and down,
    speechless, but humming a tune occasionally, always a portentous sign
    with him. The scene set was the Brocken Scene, and Conway stood at the
    top of the slope as far away from Henry as he could get! He looked
    abject. His handsome face was very red, his eyes full of tears. He was
    terrified at the thought of what was going to happen. The actor was
    summoned to the office, and presently Loveday came out and said that Mr.
    George Alexander would play Faust the following night. Alec had been
    wonderful as Valentine the night before, and as Faust he more than
    justified Henry's belief in him. After that he never looked back. He had
    come to the Lyceum for the first time in 1882, an unknown quantity from
    a stock company in Glasgow, to play Caleb Decie in "The Two Roses." He
    then left us for a time, returned for "Faust," and remained in the
    Lyceum company for some years playing all Terriss's parts.


    Alexander had the romantic quality which was lacking in Terriss, but
    there was a kind of shy modesty about him which handicapped him when he
    played Squire Thornhill in "Olivia." "Be more dashing, Alec!" I used to
    say to him. "Well, I do my best," he said. "At the hotels I chuck all
    the barmaids under the chin, and pretend I'm a dog of a fellow for the
    sake of this part!" Conscientious, dear, delightful Alec! No one ever
    deserved success more than he did and used it better when it came, as
    the history of the St. James's Theater under his management proves. He
    had the good luck to marry a wife who was clever as well as charming,
    and could help him.


    The original cast of "Faust" was never improved upon. What Martha was
    ever so good as Mrs. Stirling? The dear old lady's sight had failed
    since "Romeo and Juliet," but she was very clever at concealing it. When
    she let Mephistopheles in at the door, she used to drop her work on the
    floor so that she could find her way back to her chair. I never knew why
    she dropped it       she used to do it so naturally with a start when
    Mephistopheles knocked at the door       until one night when it was in my
    way and I picked it up, to the confusion of poor Mrs. Stirling, who
    nearly walked into the orchestra.


    "Faust" was abused a good deal as a pantomime, a distorted caricature of
    Goethe, and a thoroughly inartistic production. But it proved the
    greatest of all Henry's financial successes. The Germans who came to see
    it, oddly enough, did not scorn it nearly as much as the English who
    were sensitive on behalf of the Germans, and the Goethe Society wrote a
    tribute to Henry Irving after his death, acknowledging his services to
    Goethe!


    It is a curious paradox in the theater that the play for which every one
    has a good word is often the play which no one is going to see, while
    the play which is apparently disliked and run down is crowded every
    night.


    Our preparations for the production of "Faust" included a delightful
    "grand tour" of Germany. Henry, with his accustomed royal way of doing
    things, took a party which included my daughter Edy, Mr. and Mrs. Comyns
    Carr, and Mr. Hawes Craven, who was to paint the scenery. We bought
    nearly all the properties used in "Faust" in Nuremberg, and many other
    things which we did not use, that took Henry's fancy. One beautifully
    carved escutcheon, the finest armorial device I ever saw, he bought at
    this time and presented it in after years to the famous American
    connoisseur, Mrs. Jack Gardiner. It hangs now in one of the rooms of her
    palace at Boston.


    It was when we were going in the train along one of the most beautiful
    stretches of the Rhine that Sally Holland, who accompanied us as my
    maid, said:       


    "Uncommon pretty scenery, dear, I must say!"


    When we laughed uncontrollably, she added:


    "Well, dear, I think so!"


    During the run of "Faust" Henry visited Oxford and gave his address on
    "Four Actors" (Burbage, Betterton, Garrick, Kean). He met there one of
    the many people who had recently been attacking him on the ground of too
    long runs and too much spectacle. He wrote me an amusing account of the
    duel between them:


  
"I had supper last night at New College after the affair. A               was there, and I had it out with him       to the delight of all.

"'Too much decoration,' etc., etc.

"I asked him what there was in 'Faust' in the matter of appointments, etc., that he would like left out?'

"Answer: Nothing.

"'Too long runs.'

"'You, sir, are a poet,' I said. 'Perhaps it may be my privilege some day to produce a play of yours. Would you like it to have a long run or a short one?' (Roars of laughter.)

"Answer: 'Well       er       well, of course, Mr. Irving, you       well       well, a short run, of course for art, but       '

"'Now, sir, you're on oath,' said I. 'Suppose that the fees were rolling in £10 and more a night       would you rather the play were a failure or a success?'

"'Well, well, as you put it       I must say       er       I would rather my play had a long run!'

"A               floored!

"He has all his life been writing articles running down good work and crying up the impossible, and I was glad to show him up a bit!

"The Vice-Chancellor made a most lovely speech after the address       an eloquent and splendid tribute to the stage.

"Bourchier presented the address of the 'Undergrads.' I never saw a young man in a greater funk       because, I suppose, he had imitated me so often!

"From the address:

"'We have watched with keen and enthusiastic interest the fine intellectual quality of all these representations from Hamlet to Mephistopheles with which you have enriched the contemporary stage. To your influence we owe deeper knowledge and more reverent study of the master mind of Shakespeare.'

"All very nice indeed!"

  


    I never cared much for Henry's Mephistopheles       a twopence colored part,
    anyway. Of course he had his moments       he had them in every part       but
    they were few. One of them was in the Prologue, when he wrote in the
    student's book, "Ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil." He never
    looked at the book, and the nature of the spirit appeared suddenly in
    a most uncanny fashion. Another was in the Spinning-wheel Scene when
    Faust defies Mephistopheles, and he silences him with, "I am a
    spirit." Henry looked to grow a gigantic height       to hover over the
    ground instead of walking on it. It was terrifying.


    I made valiant efforts to learn to spin before I played Margaret. My
    instructor was Mr. Albert Fleming, who, at the suggestion of
    Ruskin, had
    recently revived hand-spinning and hand-weaving in the North of England.
    I had always hated that obviously "property" spinning-wheel in the
    opera, and Margaret's unmarketable thread. My thread always broke, and
    at last I had to "fake" my spinning to a certain extent; but at least I
    worked my wheel right, and gave an impression that I could spin my pound
    of thread a day with the best.


          

    
    

          

    ELLEN TERRY AS MARGARET IN       FAUST      

          

    Two operatic stars did me the honor to copy my Margaret dress       Madame
    Albani and Madame Melba. It was rather odd, by the way, that many
    mothers who took their daughters to see the opera of "Faust" would not
    bring them to see the Lyceum play. One of these mothers was Princess
    Mary of Teck, a constant patron of most of our plays.


    Other people "missed the music." The popularity of an opera will often
    kill a play, although the play may have existed before the music was
    ever thought of. The Lyceum "Faust" held its own against Gounod. I liked
    our incidental music to the action much better. It was taken from many
    different sources and welded into an effective and beautiful whole by
    our clever musical director, Mr. Meredith Ball.


    In many ways "Faust" was our heaviest production. About four hundred
    ropes were used, each rope with a name. The list of properties and
    instructions to the carpenters became a joke among the theater staff.
    When Henry first took "Faust" into the provinces, the head carpenter at
    Liverpool, Myers by name, being something of a humorist, copied out the
    list on a long thin sheet of paper, which rolled up like a royal
    proclamation. Instead of "God save the Queen!" he wrote at the foot,
    with many flourishes: "God help Bill Myers!"


    The crowded houses at "Faust" were largely composed of "repeaters," as
    Americans call those charming playgoers who come to see a play again and
    again. We found favor with the artists and musicians too, even in Faust!
    Here is a nice letter I got during the run (it was a long one) from
    that gifted singer and good woman, Madame Antoinette Sterling:       

                   "My dear Miss Terry,       

                  
"I was quite as disappointed as yourself that you were not at St. James's Hall last Monday for my concert....
Jean Ingelow said she enjoyed the afternoon very much....

                  
"I wonder if you would like to come to luncheon some day and have a little chat with her? But perhaps you already know her. I love her dearly. She has one fault       she never goes to the theater. Oh my! What she misses, poor thing, poor thing! We have already seen 'Faust' twice, and are going again soon, and shall take the
George Macdonalds this time. The
Holman Hunts were delighted. He is one of the most interesting and clever men I have ever met, and she is very charming and clever too. How beautifully plain you write! Give me the recipe.
      
                   "With many kind greetings,
      
                   "Believe me sincerely yours,

                  
"ANTOINETTE STERLING MACKINLAY."


    My girl Edy was one of the angels in the vision in the last act of
    "Faust," an event which Henry commemorated in a little rhyme that he
    sent me on Valentine's Day with some beautiful flowers:


  
    
      
        
          
            
"White and red roses,
Sweet and fresh posies,
One bunch for Edy, Angel of mine       
One bunch for Nell, my dear Valentine."

            
          
        
      
    
  


    Mr. Toole ran a burlesque on the Lyceum "Faust," called
    "Faust-and-Loose." Henry did not care for burlesques as a rule. He
    thought Fred Leslie's exact imitation of him, face, spectacles,
    voice       everything was like Henry except the ballet-skirt       in the worst
    taste. But everything that Toole did was to him adorable. Marie Linden
    gave a really clever imitation of me as Marguerite. She and her sister
    Laura both had the trick of taking me off. I recognized the truth of
    Laura's caricature in the burlesque of "The Vicar of Wakefield" when as
    Olivia she made her entrance, leaping impulsively over a stile!


    There was an absurd chorus of girl "mashers" in "Faust-and-Loose,"
    dressed in tight black satin coats, who besides dancing and singing had
    lines in unison, such as "No, no!" "We will!" As one of these girls
    Violet Vanbrugh made her first appearance on the stage. In her case "we
    will!" proved prophetic. It was her plucky "I will get on" which finally
    landed her in her present successful position.


    Violet Barnes was the daughter of Prebendary Barnes of Exeter, who, when
    he found his daughter stage-struck, behaved far more wisely than most
    parents. He gave her £100 and sent her to London with her old nurse to
    look after her, saying that if she really "meant business" she would
    find an engagement before the £100 was gone. Violet had inherited some
    talent from her mother, who was a very clever amateur actress, and the
    whole family were fond of getting up entertainments. But Violet didn't
    know quite how far £100 would go, or wouldn't go. I happened to call on
    her at her lodgings near Baker Street one afternoon, and found her
    having her head washed, and crying bitterly all the time! She had come
    to the end of the £100, she had not got an engagement, and thought she
    would have to go home defeated. There was something funny in the tragic
    situation. Vi was sitting on the floor, drying her hair, crying, and
    drinking port wine to cure a cold in her head!


    I told her not to be a goose, but to cheer up and come and stay with me
    until something turned up. We packed the old nurse back to Devonshire.
    Violet came and stayed with me, and in due course something did turn up.
    Mr. Toole came to dinner, and Violet, acting on my instructions to ask
    every one she saw for an engagement, asked Mr. Toole! He said, "That's
    all right, my dear. Of course. Come down and see me to-morrow." Dear old
    Toole! The kindliest of men! Violet was with him for some time, and
    played at his theater in Mr. Barrie's first piece "Walker London." Her
    sister Irene, Seymour Hicks, and Mary Ansell (now Mrs. Barrie) were all
    in the cast.


    This was all I did to "help" Violet Vanbrugh, now Mrs. Arthur Bourchier
    and one of our best actresses, in her stage career. She helped herself,
    as most people do who get on. I am afraid that I have discouraged more
    stage aspirants than I have encouraged. Perhaps I have snubbed really
    talented people, so great is my horror of girls taking to the stage as a
    profession when they don't realize what they are about. I once told an
    elderly aspirant that it was quite useless for any one to go on the
    stage who had not either great beauty or great talent. She wrote saying
    that my letter had been a great relief to her, as now she was not
    discouraged. "I have both."


    There is one actress on the English stage whom I did definitely
    encourage, of whose talent I was certain.


    When my daughter was a student at the Royal Academy of Music,
    Dr. (now
    Sir Alexander) Mackenzie asked me to distribute the medals to the
    Elocution Class at the end of the term. I was quite "new to the job,"
    and didn't understand the procedure. No girl, I have learned since, can
    be given the gold medal until she has won both the bronze and the silver
    medals       that is, until she has been at the Academy three years. I was
    for giving the gold medalists, who only wanted certificates, bronze
    medals; and of one young girl who was in her first year and only
    entitled to a bronze medal, I said: "Oh, she must have the gold medal,
    of course!"


    She was a queer-looking child, handsome, with a face suggesting all
    manner of possibilities. When she stood up to read the speech from
    "Richard II." she was nervous, but courageously stood her ground. She
    began slowly, and with a most "fetching" voice, to think out the
    words. You saw her think them, heard her speak them. It was so different
    from the intelligent elocution, the good recitation, but bad
    impersonation of the others! "A pathetic face, a passionate voice, a
    brain," I thought to myself. It must have been at this point that the
    girl flung away the book and began to act, in an undisciplined way, of
    course, but with such true emotion, such intensity, that the tears came
    to my eyes. The tears came to her eyes too. We both wept, and then we
    embraced, and then we wept again. It was an easy victory for her. She
    was incomparably better than any one. "She has to work," I wrote in my
    diary that day. "Her life must be given to it, and then she will       well,
    she will achieve just as high as she works." Lena Pocock was the girl's
    name, but she changed it to Lena Ashwell when she went on the stage.


    In the days of the elocution class there was still some idea of her
    becoming a singer, but I strongly advised the stage, and wrote to my
    friend J. Comyns Carr, who was managing the Comedy Theater, that I knew
    a girl with "supreme talent" whom he ought to engage. Lena was engaged.
    After that she had her fight for success, but she went steadily forward.


    Henry Irving has often been attacked for not preferring
    Robert Louis
    Stevenson's "Macaire" to the version which he actually produced in 1883.
    It would have been hardly more unreasonable to complain of his producing
    "Hamlet" in preference to Mr. Gilbert's "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern."
    Stevenson's "Macaire" may have all the literary quality that is claimed
    for it, although I personally think Stevenson was only making a
    delightful idiot of himself in it. Anyhow, it is frankly a burlesque, a
    skit, a satire on the real Macaire. The Lyceum was not a burlesque
    house! Why should Henry have done it?


    It was funny to see Toole and Henry rehearsing together for "Macaire."
    Henry was always plotting to be funny. When Toole as Jacques Strop hid
    the dinner in his pocket, Henry, after much labor, thought of his hiding
    the plate inside his waistcoat. There was much laughter later on when
    Macaire, playfully tapping Strop with his stick, cracked the plate, and
    the pieces fell out! Toole hadn't to bother about such subtleties, and
    Henry's deep-laid plans for getting a laugh must have seemed funny to
    dear Toole, who had only to come on and say "Whoop!" and the audience
    roared!


    Henry's death as Macaire was one of a long list of splendid deaths.
    Macaire knows the game is up, and makes a rush for the French windows at
    the back of the stage. The soldiers on the stage shoot him before he
    gets away. Henry did not drop, but turned round, swaggered impudently
    down to the table, leaned on it, then suddenly rolled over, dead.


    Henry's production of "Werner" for one matinée was to do some one a good
    turn, and when Henry did a "good turn," he did it magnificently.7 We
    rehearsed the play as carefully as if we were in for a long run.
    Beautiful dresses were made for me by my friend Alice Carr. But when we
    had given that one matinée, they were put away for ever. The play may be
    described as gloom, gloom, gloom. It was worse than "The Iron Chest."


    While Henry was occupying himself with "Werner," I was pleasing myself
    with "The Amber Heart," a play by Alfred Calmour, a young man who was at
    this time Wills's secretary. I wanted to do it, not only to help
    Calmour, but because I believed in the play and liked the part of
    Ellaline. I had thought of giving a matinée of it at some other theater,
    but Henry, who at first didn't like my doing it at all, said: "You must
    do it at the Lyceum. I can't let you, or it, go out of the theater."


    So we had the matinée at the Lyceum. Mr. Willard and Mr. Beerbohm Tree
    were in the cast, and it was a great success. For the first time Henry
    saw me act       a whole part and from the "front" at least, for he had seen
    and liked scraps of my Juliet from the "side." Although he had known me
    such a long time, my Ellaline seemed to come quite as a surprise. "I
    wish I could tell you of the dream of beauty that you realized," he
    wrote after the performance. He bought the play for me, and I continued
    to do it "on and off" here and in America until 1902.

    From the collection of Miss Frances Johnston

          

    Many people said that I was good but the play was bad. This was hard on
    Alfred Calmour. He had created the opportunity for me, and few plays
    with the beauty of "The Amber Heart" have come my way since. "He thinks
    it's all his doing!" said Henry. "If he only knew!" "Well, that's the
    way of authors," I answered. "They imagine so much more about their work
    than we put into it, that although we may seem to the outsider to be
    creating, to the author we are, at our best, only doing our duty by
    him."


    Our next production was "Macbeth." Meanwhile we had visited America
    three times. It is now my intention to give some account of my tours in
    America, of my friends there, and of some of the impressions that the
    vast, wonderful country made on me.

          
XI
      

AMERICA
      
THE FIRST OF EIGHT TOURS
      

    The first time that there was any talk of my going to America was, I
    think, in 1874, when I was playing in "The Wandering Heir."
    Dion
    Boucicault wanted me to go, and dazzled me with figures, but I expect
    the cautious Charles Reade influenced me against accepting the
    engagement.


    When I did go in 1883, I was thirty-five and had an assured position in
    my profession. It was the first of eight tours, seven of which I went
    with Henry Irving. The last was in 1907 after his death. I also went to
    America one summer on a pleasure trip. The tours lasted three months at
    least, seven months at most. After a rough calculation, I find that I
    have spent not quite five years of my life in America. Five out of sixty
    is not a large proportion, yet I often feel that I am half American.
    This says a good deal for the hospitality of a people who can make a
    stranger feel so completely at home in their midst. Perhaps it also says
    something for my adaptableness!


    "When we do not speak of things with a partiality full of love, what we
    say is not worth being repeated." That was the answer of a courteous
    Frenchman who was asked for his impressions of a country. In any case it
    is imprudent to give one's impressions of America. The country is so
    vast and complex that even those who have amassed mountains of
    impressions soon find that there still are mountains more! I have lived
    in New York, Boston and Chicago for a month at a time, and have felt
    that to know any of these great cities even superficially would take a
    year. I have become acquainted with this and that class of American, but
    I realize that there are thousands of other classes that remain unknown
    to me.


    I set out in 1882 from Liverpool on board the Britannic with the fixed
    conviction that I should never, never return. For six weeks before we
    started, the word America had only to be breathed to me, and I burst
    into floods of tears! I was leaving my children, my bullfinch, my
    parrot, my "aunt" Boo, whom I never expected to see alive again, just
    because she said I never would; and I was going to face the unknown
    dangers of the Atlantic and of a strange, barbarous land. Our farewell
    performances in London had cheered me up a little       though I wept
    copiously at every one       by showing us that we should be missed. Henry
    Irving's position seemed to be confirmed and ratified by all that took
    place before his departure. The dinners he had to eat, the speeches that
    he had to make and to listen to, were really terrific!


    One speech at the Rabelais Club had, it was said, the longest peroration
    on record. It was this kind of thing: Where is our friend Irving going?
    He is not going like Nares to face the perils of the far North. He is
    not going like A               to face something else. He is not going to China,
    etc.,       and so on. After about the hundredth "he is not going,"
    Lord
    Houghton, who was one of the guests, grew very impatient and
    interrupted the orator with: "Of course he isn't! He's going to New York
    by the Cunard Line. It'll take him about a week!"


    Many people came to see us off at Liverpool, but I only remember seeing
    Mrs. Langtry and Oscar Wilde. It was at this time that Oscar Wilde had
    begun to curl his hair in the manner of the Prince Regent. "Curly hair
    to match the curly teeth," said some one. Oscar Wilde had ugly teeth,
    and he was not proud of his mouth. He used to put his hand to his mouth
    when he talked so that it should not be noticed. His brow and eyes were
    very beautiful.


    Well, I was not "disappointed in the Atlantic," as Oscar Wilde was the
    first to say, though many people have said it since without
    acknowledging its source.


    My first voyage was a voyage of enchantment to me. The ship was laden
    with pig-iron, and she rolled and rolled and rolled. She could never
    roll too much for me! I have always been a splendid sailor, and I feel
    jolly at sea. The sudden leap from home into the wilderness of waves
    does not give me any sensation of melancholy.


    What I thought I was going to see when I arrived in America I hardly
    remember. I had a vague idea that all American women wore red flannel
    shirts and carried bowie knives and that I might be sandbagged in the
    street! From somewhere or other I had derived an impression that New
    York was an ugly, noisy place.


    Ugly! When I first saw that marvelous harbor I nearly cried       it was so
    beautiful. Whenever I come now to the unequaled approach to New York I
    wonder what Americans must think of the approach from the sea to London!
    How different are the mean, flat, marshy banks of the Thames and the
    wooden toy lighthouse at Dungeness to the vast, spreading Hudson with
    its busy multitude of steamboats, and ferryboats, its wharf upon wharf,
    and its tall statue of Liberty dominating all the racket and bustle of
    the sea traffic of the world!


    That was one of the few times in America when I did not miss the poetry
    of the past. The poetry of the present, gigantic, colossal and enormous,
    made me forget it. The "sky-scrapers"       what a brutal name it is when one
    comes to think of it!       so splendid in the landscape now, did not exist
    in 1883, but I find it difficult to divide my early impressions from my
    later ones. There was Brooklyn Bridge though, hung up high in the air
    like a vast spider's web.


    Between 1883 and 1893 I noticed a great change in New York and other
    cities. In ten years they seemed to have grown with the energy of
    tropical plants. But between 1893 and 1907 I saw no evidence of such
    feverish increase. It is possible that the Americans are arriving at a
    stage when they can no longer beat the records! There is a vast
    difference between one of the old New York brownstone houses and one of
    the fourteen-storied buildings near the river, but between this and the
    Times Square Building or the still more amazing Flat Iron Building,
    which is said to oscillate at the top       it is so far from the
    ground       there is very little difference. I hear that they are now
    beginning to build downwards into the earth, but this will not change
    the appearance of New York for a long time.


    I had not to endure the wooden shed in which most people landing in
    America have to struggle with the Custom-house officials       a struggle as
    brutal as a "round in the ring," as Paul Bourget describes it. We were
    taken off the Britannic in a tug, and Mr. Abbey,
    Laurence Barrett, and
    many other friends met us       including the much-dreaded reporters.


    They were not a bit dreadful, but very quick to see what kind of a man
    Henry was. In a minute he was on the best of terms with them. He had on
    what I used to call his best "Jingle" manner       a manner full of
    refinement, bonhomie, elegance and geniality.


    "Have a cigar       have a cigar." That was the first remark of Henry's,
    which put every one at ease. He also wanted to be at ease and have a
    good smoke. It was just the right merry greeting to the press
    representatives of a nation whose sense of humor is far more to be
    relied on than its sense of reverence.


    "Now come on, all of you!" he said to the interviewers. He talked to
    them all in a mass and showed no favoritism. It says much for his tact
    and diplomacy that he did not "put his foot in it." The Americans are
    suspicious of servile adulation from a stranger, yet are very sensitive
    to criticism.


    "These gentlemen want to have a few words with you," said Henry to me
    when the reporters had done with him. Then with a mischievous expression
    he whispered: "Say something pleasant! Merry and bright!"


    Merry and bright! I felt it! The sense of being a stranger entering a
    strange land, the rushing sense of loneliness and foreignness was
    overpowering my imagination. I blew my nose hard and tried to keep back
    my tears, but the first reporter said: "Can I send any message to your
    friends in England?"


    I answered: "Tell them I never loved 'em so much as now," and burst into
    tears! No wonder that he wrote in his paper that I was "a woman of
    extreme nervous sensibility." Another of them said that "my figure was
    spare almost to attenuation." America soon remedied that. I began to put
    on flesh before I had been in the country a week, and it was during my
    fifth American tour that I became really fat for the first time in my
    life.

          

    
    

    MISS ELLEN TERRY IN 1883
    From a photograph taken at the time of her
    first appearance in America
    From the collection of Miss Evelyn Smalley


    When we landed I drove to the Hotel Dam, Henry to the Brevoort House.
    There was no Diana on the top of the Madison Square Building then. The
    building did not exist, to cheer the heart of a new arrival as the first
    evidence of beauty in the city. There were horse trams instead of
    cable cars, but a quarter of a century has not altered the peculiarly
    dilapidated carriages in which one drives from the dock, the muddy
    side-walks, and the cavernous holes in the cobble-paved streets. Had the
    elevated railway, the first sign of power that one notices after
    leaving the boat, begun to thunder through the streets? I cannot
    remember New York without it.


    I missed then, as I miss now, the numberless hansoms of London plying
    in the streets for hire. People in New York get about in the cars,
    unless they have their own carriages. The hired carriage has no reason
    for existing, and when it does, it celebrates its unique position by
    charging two dollars (8s.) for a journey which in London would not
    cost fifty cents (2s.)!


    I cried for two hours at the Hotel Dam! Then my companion, Miss
    Harries, came bustling in with: "Never mind! here's a piano!" and sat
    down and played "Annie Laurie" very badly until I screamed with
    laughter. Before the evening came my room was like a bower of roses, and
    my dear friends in America have been throwing bouquets at me in the same
    lavish way ever since. I had quite cheered up when Henry came to take me
    to see some minstrels who were performing at the Star Theater, the very
    theater where in a few days we were to open. I didn't understand many of
    the jokes which the American comedians made that night, but I liked
    their dry, cool way of making them. They did not "hand a lemon" or
    "skiddoo" in those days; American slang changes as quickly as thieves'
    slang, and only "Gee!" and "Gee-whiz!" seem to be permanent.


    There were very few theaters in New York when we first went there. All
    that part of the city which is now "up town" did not exist, and what was
    then "up" is now more than "down" town. The American stage has changed
    almost as much. In those days their most distinguished actors were
    playing Shakespeare or old comedy, and their new plays were chiefly
    "imported" goods. Even then there was a liking for local plays which
    showed the peculiarities of the different States, but they were more
    violent and crude than now. The original American genius and the true
    dramatic pleasure of the people is, I believe, in such plays, where very
    complete observation of certain phases of American life and very real
    pictures of manners are combined with comedy almost childlike in its
    naïveté. The sovereignty of the young girl which is such a marked
    feature in social life is reflected in American plays.


    This is by the way.


    What I want to make clear is that in 1883 there was no living American
    drama as there is now, that such productions of romantic plays and
    Shakespeare as Henry Irving brought over from England were unknown, and
    that the extraordinary success of our first tours would be impossible
    now. We were the first and we were pioneers, and we were new. To be
    new is everything in America.


    Such palaces as the Hudson Theater, New York, were not dreamed of when
    we were at the Star, which was, however, quite equal to any theater in
    London in front of the footlights. The stage itself, the lighting
    appliances, and the dressing-rooms were inferior.


    Henry made his first appearance in America in "The Bells." He was not at
    his best on the first night, but he could be pretty good even when he
    was not at his best. I watched him from a box. Nervousness made the
    company very slow. The audience was a splendid one       discriminating and
    appreciative. We felt that the Americans wanted to like us. We felt in
    a few days so extraordinarily at home. The first sensation of entering a
    foreign city was quickly wiped out.


    The difference in atmosphere disappears directly one understands it. I
    kept on coming across duplicates of "my friends in England." "How this
    girl reminds me of Alice." "How like that one is to Gill!" We had
    transported the Lyceum three thousand miles       that was all.


    On the second night in New York it was my turn. "Command yourself       this
    is the time to show you can act!" I said to myself as I went on to the
    stage of the Star Theater, dressed as Henrietta Maria. But I could not
    command myself. I played badly and cried too much in the last act. But
    the people liked me, and they liked the play, perhaps because it was
    historical; and of history the Americans are passionately fond. The
    audience took many points which had been ignored in London. I had always
    thought Henry as Charles I. most moving when he made that involuntary
    effort to kneel to his subject, Moray, but the Lyceum audiences never
    seemed to notice it. In New York the audience burst out into the most
    sympathetic spontaneous applause that I have ever heard in a theater.


    I know that there are some advanced stage reformers who prefer to think
    applause "vulgar," and would suppress it in the theater if they could.
    If they ever succeed they will suppress a great deal of good acting. It
    is said that the American actor, Edwin Forrest, once walked down to the
    footlights and said to the audience very gravely and sincerely: "If you
    don't applaud, I can't act," and I do sympathize with him. Applause is
    an instinctive, unconscious act expressing the sympathy between actors
    and audience. Just as our art demands more instinct than intellect in
    its exercise, so we demand of those who watch us an appreciation of the
    simple unconscious kind which finds an outlet in clapping rather than
    the cold, intellectual approval which would self-consciously think
    applause derogatory. I have yet to meet the actor who was sincere in
    saying that he disliked applause.


    My impression of the way the American women dressed in 1883 was not
    favorable. Some of them wore Indian shawls and diamond earrings. They
    dressed too grandly in the street and too dowdily in the theater. All
    this has changed. The stores in New York are now the most beautiful in
    the world, and the women are dressed to perfection. They are as clever
    at the demi-toilette as the Parisian, and the extreme neatness and
    smartness of their walking-gowns are very refreshing after the floppy,
    blowsy, trailing dresses, accompanied by the inevitable feather boa of
    which English girls, who used to be so tidy and "tailor-made," now seem
    so fond. The universal white "waist" is very pretty and trim on the
    American girl. It is one of the distinguishing marks of a land of the
    free, a land where "class" hardly exists. The girl in the store wears
    the white waist; so does the rich girl on Fifth Avenue. It costs
    anything from seventy-five cents to fifty dollars!


    London when I come back from America always seems at first like an
    ill-lighted village, strangely tame, peaceful and backward. Above all, I
    miss the sunlight of America, and the clear blue skies of an evening.


    "Are you glad to get back?" said an English friend.


    "Very."


    "It's a land of vulgarity, isn't it?"


    "Oh yes, if you mean by that a wonderful land       a land of sunshine and
    light, of happiness, of faith in the future!" I answered. I saw no
    misery or poverty there. Every one looked happy. What hurts me on coming
    back to England is the hopeless look on so many faces; the dejection
    and apathy of the people standing about in the streets. Of course there
    is poverty in New York, but not among the Americans. The Italians, the
    Russians, the Poles       all the host of immigrants washed in daily on the
    bosom of the Hudson       these are poor, but you don't see them unless you
    go Bowery-ways, and even then you can't help feeling that in their
    sufferings there is always hope. The barrow man of to-day is the
    millionaire of to-morrow! Vulgarity? I saw little of it. I thought that
    the people who had amassed large fortunes used their wealth beautifully.


    When a man is rich enough to build himself a big new house, he remembers
    some old house which he once admired, and he has it imitated with all
    the technical skill and care that can be had in America. This accounts
    for the odd jumble of styles in Fifth Avenue, along the lakeside in
    Chicago, in the new avenues in St. Louis and elsewhere. One
    millionaire's house is modeled on a French château, another on an old
    Colonial house in Virginia, another on a monastery in Mexico, another is
    like an Italian palazzo. And their imitations are never weak or
    pretentious. The architects in America seem to me to be far more able
    than ours, or else they have a freer hand and more money. It is sad to
    remember that Mr. Stanford White was one of the best of these splendid
    architects.


    It was Stanford White with Saint-Gaudens       that great sculptor, whose
    work dignifies nearly all the great cities in America       who had most to
    do with the Exhibition buildings of the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893.
    It was odd to see that fair dream city rising out of the lake, so far
    more beautiful in its fleeting beauty than the Chicago of the
    stock-yards and the Pit which had provided the money for its beauty. The
    millionaires did not interfere with the artists at all. They gave their
    thousands       and stood aside. The result was one of the loveliest things
    conceivable. Saint-Gaudens and the rest did their work as well as though
    the buildings were to endure for centuries instead of being burned in a
    year to save the trouble of pulling down! The World's Fair always
    recalled to me the story of Michael Angelo, who carved a figure in snow
    which, says the chronicler who saw it, "was superb."


    Saint-Gaudens gave me a cast of his medallion of Bastien-Lepage, and
    wrote to a friend of mine that "Bastien had 'le coeur au métier.' So
    has Miss Terry, and I will place that saying in the frame that is to
    replace the present unsatisfactory one." He was very fastidious about
    this frame, and took such a lot of trouble to get it right. It must have
    been very irritating to Saint-Gaudens when he fell a victim to that
    extraordinary official puritanism which sometimes exercises a petty
    censorship over works of art in America. The medal that he made for the
    World's Fair was rejected at Washington because it had on it a beautiful
    little nude figure of a boy holding an olive branch, emblematical of
    young America. I think a commonplace wreath and some lettering were
    substituted.


    Saint-Gaudens did the fine bas-relief of Robert Louis Stevenson which
    was chosen for the monument in St. Gile's Cathedral, Edinburgh. He gave
    my daughter a medallion cast from this, because he knew that she was a
    great lover of Stevenson. The bas-relief was dedicated to his friend
    Joe
    Evans. I knew Saint-Gaudens first through Joe Evans, an artist who,
    while he lived, was to me and to my daughter the dearest of all in
    America. His character was so fine and noble       his nature so perfect.
    Many were the birthday cards he did for me, original in design,
    beautiful in execution. Whatever he did he put the best of himself into
    it. I wrote to my daughter soon after his death:       


  
                   "I heard on Saturday that our dear Joe Evans is dangerously ill. Yesterday came the worst news. Joe was not happy, but he was just heroic, and this world wasn't half good enough for him. I keep on getting letters about him. He seems to have been so glad to die. It was like a child's funeral, I am told, and all his American friends seem to have been there       Saint-Gaudens,
Taber, etc. A poem about the dear fellow by Mr.
Gilder has one very good line in which he says the grave 'might snatch a brightness from his presence there.' I thought that was very happy, the love of light and gladness being the most remarkable thing about him, the dear sad Joe."
  


          

    
    

          

    THE BAS-RELIEF PORTRAIT OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

    Modeled by Augustus Saint-Gaudens for the St. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh.
    Saint-Gaudens gave a cast of this portrait to Miss Terry's daughter, Edith
    Craig

          

    Robert Taber, dear, and rather sad too, was a great friend of Joe's.
    They both came to me first in the shape of a little book in which was
    inscribed, "Never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender
    it." "Upon this hint I spake," the book began. It was all the work of a
    few boys and girls who from the gallery of the Star Theater, New York,
    had watched Irving's productions and learned to love him and me. Joe
    Evans had done a lovely picture by way of frontispiece of a group of
    eager heads hanging over the gallery's edge, his own and Taber's among
    them. Eventually Taber came to England and acted with Henry Irving in
    "Peter the Great" and other plays.


    Like his friend Joe, he too was heroic. His health was bad and his life
    none too happy       but he struggled on. His career was cut short by
    consumption, and he died in the Adirondacks in 1904.


    I cannot speak of all my friends in America, or anywhere, for the matter
    of that, individually. My personal friends are so many, and they are
    all wonderful       wonderfully staunch to me! I have "tried" them so, and
    they have never given me up as a bad job.


    My first friends of all in America were Mr. Bayard, afterwards the
    American Ambassador in London, and his sister, Mrs. Benoni Lockwood, her
    husband and their children. Now after all these years they are still my
    friends, and I can hope for none better to the end.


    William Winter, poet, critic and exquisite man, was one of the first to
    write of Henry with whole-hearted appreciation. But all the criticism in
    America, favorable and unfavorable, surprised us by the scholarly
    knowledge it displayed. In Chicago the notices were worthy of the
    Temps or the Journal des Débats. There was no attempt to force the
    personality of the writer into the foreground nor to write a style that
    should attract attention to the critic and leave the thing criticized to
    take care of itself. William Winter, and, of late years, Allan Dale,
    have had their personalities associated with their criticisms, but they
    are exceptions. Curiously enough the art of acting appears to bore most
    dramatic critics, the very people who might be expected to be interested
    in it. The American critics, however, at the time of our early visits,
    were keenly interested, and showed it by their observation of many
    points which our English critics had passed over. For instance, writing
    of "Much Ado about Nothing," one of the Americans said of Henry in the
    Church Scene that "something of him as a subtle interpreter of doubtful
    situations was exquisitely shown in the early part of this fine scene by
    his suspicion of Don John       felt by him alone, and expressed only by a
    quick covert look, but a look so full of intelligence as to proclaim him
    a sharer in the secret with his audience."


    "Wherein does the superiority lie?" wrote another critic in comparing
    our productions with those which had been seen in America up to 1884.
    "Not in the amount of money expended, but in the amount of brains;       in
    the artistic intelligence and careful and earnest pains with which every
    detail is studied and worked out. Nor is there any reason why Mr. Irving
    or any other foreigner should have a monopoly of either intelligence or
    pains. They are common property, and one man's money can buy them as
    well as another's. The defect in the American manager's policy
    heretofore has been that he has squandered his money upon high salaries
    for a few of his actors and costly, because unintelligent, expenditure
    for mere dazzle and show."


    William Winter soon became a great personal friend of ours, and visited
    us in England. He was one of the few sad people I met in America. He
    could have sat upon the ground and told "sad stories of the deaths of
    kings" with the best. He was very familiar with the poetry of the
    immediate past       Cowper, Coleridge, Gray, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats,
    and the rest. He liked us, so everything we did was right to him. He
    could not help being guided entirely by his feelings. If he disliked a
    thing, he had no use for it. Some men can say, "I hate this play, but
    of its kind it is admirable." Willie Winter could never take that
    unemotional point of view. In England he loved going to see graveyards,
    and knew where every poet was buried.


    His children came to stay with me in London. When we were all coming
    home from the theater one night after "Faust" (the year must have been
    1886) I said to little Willie:


    "Well, what do you think of the play?"


    "Oh my!" said he, "it takes the cake."


    "Takes the cake!" said his little sister scornfully, "it takes the
    ice-cream!"


    "Won't you give me a kiss?" said Henry to the same young miss one night.
    "No, I won't with all that blue stuff on your face." (He was made up
    for Mephistopheles.) Then, after a pause, "But why       why don't you take
    it!" She was only five years old at the time!


    I love the American papers, especially the Sunday ones, although they do
    weigh nearly half a ton! As for the interviewers, I never cease to
    marvel at their cleverness. I tell them nothing, and the next day I read
    their "story" and find that I have said the most brilliant things! The
    following delightful "skit" on one of these interviews suggested itself
    to my clever friend Miss Aimée Lowther:       


    WHAT CONSTITUTES CHARM


    AN ILLUSTRATED INTERVIEW WITH MISS ELLEN TERRY


    "Yes, I know that I am very charming," said Miss Ellen Terry, "a
    perfectly delightful creature, a Queen of Hearts, a regular witch!" she
    added thoughtfully, at the same time projecting a pip of the orange she
    was chewing, with inimitable grace and accurate aim into


    THE REPORTER'S EYE.


    "You know, at all events, that you have charm?" I said.


    "What do you think, you idiot! I exercise absolute power over my
    audiences       I cast over them an irresistible spell       I do with them what I
    will.... I am omnipotent, enthralling       and no wonder!"


    I looked at her across the table, wondering at so much simple modesty.


    "But feeling your power, you must often be tempted to experiment with
    it," I ventured.


    "Yes, now and then I am," replied Miss Terry. "Once, I remember, when I
    was to appear as Ophelia, on making my entrance and seeing the audience
    waiting breathlessly       as they always do       for what I was going to do
    next, I said to myself, 'You silly fools, you shall have a treat
    to-night       I will give you something you will appreciate more than
    Shakespeare!' Hastily slipping on a


    FALSE NOSE


    which I always carry in my pocket, I struck an attitude, and then turned

    A SOMERSAULT.


    "Ah! the applause, the delirious, intoxicating applause! That night I
    felt my power, that night I knew that I had wished I could have held
    them indefinitely! But I am only one of several gifted beings on the
    stage who are blessed with this mysterious quality. Dan Leno, Herbert
    Campbell, and Little Tich all have it. Dan Leno, in particular, rivets
    the attention of his audience by his entrancing by-play, even when he
    doesn't speak. And yet it is


    NOT HIS BEAUTY


    precisely that does it."


    At that moment Miss Terry's little grandchild, who was playing about the
    room,


    BEGAN TO HOWL


    most dismally.

    "Here is a little maid who was a charmer from her cradle," said the
    delightful actress, picking up the child and


    PLAYFULLY TOSSING


    it out of the third-floor window. Seeing me look relieved, though
    somewhat surprised, she said merrily: "I have plenty more of them at
    home, and they are


    ALL CHARMING,


    every one of them! If you want to be charming you must be natural       I
    always am. Even in my cradle I was


    QUITE NATURAL.


    And now, please go. Your conversation bores me inexpressibly, and your
    countenance, which is at once vacuous and singularly plain, disagrees
    with me thoroughly. Go! or I shall


    BE SICK!"


    So saying the great actress gave me a


    VIGOROUS KICK


    which landed me outside her room, considerably shaken, and entirely
    under the spell of her matchless charm.

SIR HENRY IRVING
From a snap-shot taken in the
United States

          

    For "quite a while" during the first tour I stayed in Washington with
    my friend Miss Olive Seward, and all the servants of that delightful
    household were colored. This was my first introduction to the negroes,
    whose presence more than anything else in the country, makes America
    seem foreign to European eyes. They are more sharply divided into high
    and low types than white people, and are not in the least alike in their
    types. It is safe to call any colored man "George." They all love it,
    perhaps because of George Washington, and most of them are really named
    George. I never met such perfect service as they can give. Some of
    them are delightful. The beautiful, full voice of the "darkey" is so
    attractive, so soothing, and they are so deft and gentle. Some of the
    women are beautiful, and all the young appeared to me to be well-formed.
    As for the babies! I washed two or three little piccaninnies when I was
    in the South, and the way they rolled their gorgeous eyes at me was "too
    cute," which means in British-English "fascinating."


    At the Washington house, the servants danced a cake-walk for me       the
    colored cook, a magnificent type, who "took the cake," saying, "that was
    because I chose a good handsome boy to dance with, Missie."


    They sang too. Their voices were beautiful       with such illimitable power,
    yet as sweet as treacle.


    The little page-boy had a pet of a wooly head. Henry once gave him a
    tip       "fee," as they call it in America       and said: "There, that's for a
    new wig when this one is worn out," gently pulling the astrakhan-like
    hair. The tip would have bought him many wigs, I think!


    "Why, Uncle Tom, how your face shines to-night!" said my hostess to one
    of the very old servants.


    "Yes, Missie, glycerine and rose-water, Missie!"


    He had taken some from her dressing-table to shine up his face in honor
    of me! A shiny complexion is considered to be a great beauty among the
    negroes! The dear old man! He was very bent and very old; and looked
    like one of the logs that he used to bring in for the fire       a log from
    some hoary, lichened tree whose life was long since past. He would
    produce a pin from his head when you wanted one; he had them stuck in
    his pad of white wooly hair: "Always handy then, Missie," he would say.


    "Ask them to sing 'Sweet Violets,' Uncle Tom."


    He was acting as a sort of master of the ceremonies at the entertainment
    the servants were giving me.


    "Don't think they know dat, Miss Olly."


    "Why, I heard them singing it the other night!" And she hummed the tune.


    "Oh, dat was 'Sweet Vio-letts,' Miss Olly!"


    Washington was the first city I had seen in America where the people did
    not hurry, and where the social life did not seem entirely the work of
    women. The men asserted themselves here as something more than machines
    in the background untiringly turning out the dollars, while their wives
    and daughters give luncheons and teas at which only women are present.


    Beautifully as the women dress, they talk very little about clothes. I
    was much struck by their culture       by the evidences that they had read
    far more and developed a more fastidious taste than most young
    Englishwomen. Yet it is all mixed up with extraordinary naïveté. The
    vivacity, the appearance, at least, of reality, the animation, the
    energy of American women delighted me. They are very sympathetic, too,
    in spite of a certain callousness which comes of regarding everything in
    life, even love, as "lots of fun." I did not think that they, or the men
    either, had much natural sense of beauty. They admire beauty in a
    curious way through their intellect. Nearly every American girl has a
    cast of the winged Victory of the Louvre in her room. She makes it a
    point of her education to admire it.


    There! I am beginning to generalize       the very thing I was resolute to
    avoid. How silly to generalize about a country which embraces such
    extremes of climate as the sharp winters of Boston and New York and the
    warm winds of Florida which blow through palms and orange groves!

          

    XII 
    SOME LIKES AND DISLIKES


    It is only human to make comparisons between American and English
    institutions, although they are likely to turn out as odious as the
    proverb says! The first institution in America that distressed me was
    the steam heat. It is far more manageable now than it was both in hotels
    and theaters, because there are more individual heaters. But how I
    suffered from it at first I cannot describe! I used to feel dreadfully
    ill, and when we could not turn the heat off at the theater, the plays
    always went badly. My voice was affected too. At Toledo once, it nearly
    went altogether. Then the next night, after a good fight for it, we got
    the theater cool, and the difference that it made to the play was
    extraordinary. I was in my best form, feeling well and jolly!


    No wonder the Americans drink ice-water and wear very thin clothes
    indoors. Their rooms are hotter than ours ever are, even in the height
    of the summer       when we have a summer! But no wonder, either, that
    Americans in England shiver at our cold, draughty rooms. They are
    brought up in hot-houses.


    If I did not like steam heat, I loved the ice which is such a feature at
    American meals. Everything is served on ice, and the ice-water, however
    pernicious the European may consider it as a drink, looks charming and
    cool in the hot rooms.


    I liked the traveling; but then we traveled in a very princely fashion.
    The Lyceum company and baggage occupied eight cars, and Henry's private
    parlor car was lovely. The only thing that we found was better
    understood in England, so far as railway traveling is concerned, was
    privacy. You may have a private car in America, but all the
    conductors on the train, and there is one to each car, can walk through
    it. So can any official, baggage man or newsboy who has the mind!


    The "parlor car" in America is more luxurious than our first class, but
    you travel in it (if you have no "private" car) with thirty other
    people.


    "What do you want to be private for?" asked an American, and you don't
    know how to answer, for you find that with them that privacy means
    concealment. For this reason, I believe, they don't have hedges or walls
    round their estates and gardens. "Why should we? We have nothing to
    hide!"


    In the cars, as in the rooms at one's hotel, the "cuspidor" is always
    with you as a thing of beauty! When I first went to America the "Ladies'
    Entrance" to the hotel was really necessary, because the ordinary
    entrance was impassable! Since then very severe laws against spitting in
    public places have been passed, and there is a great improvement. But
    the habit, I suppose due to the dryness of the climate, or to the very
    strong cigars smoked, or to chronic catarrh, or to a feeling of
    independence       "This is a free country and I can spit if I
    choose!"       remains sufficiently disgusting to a stranger visiting the
    country.


    The American voice is the one thing in the country that I find
    unbearable; yet the truly terrible variety only exists in one State, and
    is not widely distributed. I suppose it is its very assertiveness that
    makes one forget the very sweet voices that also exist in America. The
    Southern voice is very low in tone and soothing, like the "darkey"
    voice. It is as different from Yankee as the Yorkshire burr is from the
    Cockney accent.


    This question of accent is a very funny one. I had not been in America
    long when a friend said to me:


    "We like your voice. You have so little English accent!"


    This struck me as rather cool. Surely English should be spoken with an
    English accent, not with a French, German, or double-dutch one! Then I
    found that what they meant by an English accent was an English
    affectation of speech       a drawl with a tendency to "aw" and "ah"
    everything. They thought that every one in England who did not miss out
    aspirates where they should be, and put them in where they should not
    be, talked of "the rivah," "ma brothar," and so on. Their conclusion
    was, after all, quite as well founded as ours about their accent. The
    American intonation, with its freedom from violent emphasis, is, I
    think, rather pretty when the quality of the voice is sweet.


    Of course the Americans would have their jokes about Henry's method of
    speech. Ristori followed us once in New York, and a newspaper man said
    he was not sure whether she or Mr. Irving was the more difficult for an
    American to understand.


    "He pronounces the English tongue as it is pronounced by no other man,
    woman or child," wrote the critic, and proceeded to give a phonetically
    spelled version of Irving's delivery of Shylock's speech of Antonio.


  
    
      
        
          
            
"Wa thane, ett no eperes
Ah! um! yo ned m'clp
Ough! ough! Gaw too thane! Ha! um!
Yo com'n say
Ah! Shilok, um! ouch! we wode hev moanies!"

            
          
        
      
    
  


    I wonder if the clever American reporter stopped to think how his
    delivery of the same speech would look in print! As for the
    ejaculations, the interjections and grunts with which Henry interlarded
    the text, they often helped to reveal the meaning of Shakespeare to his
    audience       a meaning which many a perfect elocutionist has left perfectly
    obscure. The use of "m'" or "me" for "my" has often been hurled in my
    face as a reproach, but I never contracted "my" without good reason. I
    had a line in Olivia which I began by delivering as       

                   "My sorrows and my shame are my own."


    Then I saw that the "mys" sounded ridiculous, and abbreviated the two
    first ones into "me's."


    There were of course people ready to say that the Americans did not like
    Henry Irving as an actor, and that they only accepted him as a
    manager       that he triumphed in New York as he had done in London, through
    his lavish spectacular effects. This is all moonshine. Henry made his
    first appearance in "The Bells," his second in "Charles I.," his third
    in "Louis XI." By that time he had conquered, and without the aid of
    anything at all notable in the mounting of the plays. It was not until
    we did "The Merchant of Venice" that he gave the Americans anything of a
    "production."


    My first appearance in America in Shakespeare was as Portia, and I could
    not help feeling pleased by my success. A few weeks later I played
    Ophelia at Philadelphia. It is in Shakespeare that I have been best
    liked in America, and I consider that Beatrice was the part about which
    they were most enthusiastic.


    During our first tour we visited in succession New York, Philadelphia,
    Boston, Baltimore, Brooklyn, Chicago, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Detroit,
    and Toronto. To most of these places we paid return visits.


    "To what do you attribute your success, Mr. Irving?"


    "To my acting," was the simple reply.


    We never had poor houses except in Baltimore and St. Louis. Our journey
    to Baltimore was made in a blizzard. They were clearing the snow before
    us all the way from New Jersey, and we took forty-two hours to reach
    Baltimore! The bells of trains before us and behind us sounded very
    alarming. We opened in Baltimore on Christmas day. The audience was
    wretchedly small, but the poor things who were there had left their warm
    firesides to drive or tramp through the slush of melting snow, and each
    one who managed to reach the theater was worth a hundred on an ordinary
    night.


    At the hotel I put up holly and mistletoe, and produced from my trunks a
    real Christmas pudding that my mother had made. We had it for supper,
    and it was very good.


    It never does to repeat an experiment. Next year at Pittsburg my little
    son Teddy brought me out another pudding from England. For once we were
    in an uncomfortable hotel, and the Christmas dinner was deplorable. It
    began with burned hare soup.


    "It seems to me," said Henry, "that we aren't going to get anything to
    eat, but we'll make up for it by drinking!"


    He had brought his own wine out with him from England, and the company
    took him at his word and did make up for it!


    "Never mind!" I said, as the soup was followed by worse and worse.
    "There's my pudding!"


    It came on blazing, and looked superb. Henry tasted a mouthful.


    "Very odd," he said, "but I think this is a camphor pudding."


    He said it so politely, as if he might easily be mistaken!


    My maid in England had packed the pudding with my furs! It simply reeked
    of camphor.


    So we had to dine on Henry's wine and L.F. Austin's wit. This dear,
    brilliant man, now dead, acted for many years as Henry's secretary, and
    one of his gifts was the happy knack of hitting off people's
    peculiarities in rhyme. This dreadful Christmas dinner at Pittsburg was
    enlivened by a collection of such rhymes, which Mr. Austin called a
    "Lyceum Christmas Play."


    Every one roared with laughter until it came to the verse of which he
    was the victim, when suddenly he found the fun rather labored!


    The first verse was spoken by Loveday, who announces that the "Governor"
    has a new play which is "Wonderful!" a great word of Loveday's.


    George Alexander replies:


  
    
      
        
          
"But I say, Loveday, have I got a part in it,
That I can wear a cloak in and look smart in it?
Not that I care a fig for gaudy show, dear boy       
But juveniles must look well, don't you know, dear boy.
And shall I lordly hall and tuns of claret own?
And may I murmur love in dulcet baritone?
Tell me at least, this simple fact of it       
Can I beat Terriss hollow in one act of it?8
Pooh for Wenman's bass!9 Why should he make a boast of it?"

          
        
      
    
  


    Norman Forbes:


  
    
      
        
          
"If he has a voice, I have got the ghost of it!
When I pitch it low, you may say how weak it is,
When I pitch it high, heavens! what a squeak it is!
But I never mind; for what does it signify?
See my graceful hands, they're the things that dignify;
All the rest is froth, and egotism's dizziness       
Have I not played with Phelps?
(To Wenman)
I'll teach you all the business!"

          
        
      
    
  


    T. Mead:


    (Of whom much has already been written in these pages.)


  
    
      
        
          
"What's this about a voice? Surely you forget it, or
Wilfully conceal that I have no competitor!
I do not know the play, or even what the title is,
But safe to make success a charnel-house recital is!
So please to bear in mind, if I am not to fail in it,
That Hamlet's father's ghost must rob the Lyons Mail in it!
No! that's not correct! But you may spare your charity       
A good sepulchral groan's the thing for popularity!"

          
        
      
    
  


    H. Howe:


    (The "agricultural" actor, as Henry called him.)


  
    
      
        
          
"Boys, take my advice, the stage is not the question,
But whether at three score you'll all have my digestion.
Why yearn for plays, to pose as Brutuses or Catos in,
When you may get a garden to grow the best potatoes in?
You see that at my age by Nature's shocks unharmed I am!
Tho' if I sneeze but thrice, good heavens, how alarmed I am!
But act your parts like men, and tho' you all great sinners are,
You're sure to act like men wherever Irving's dinners are!"

          
        
      
    
  


    J.H. Allen (our prompter):


  
    
      
        
          
"Whatever be the play, I must have a hand in it,
For won't I teach the supers how to stalk and stand in it?
Tho' that blessed Shakespeare never gives a ray to them,
    I explain the text, and then it's clear as day to them!10
Plain as A B C is a plot historical,
When I overhaul allusions allegorical!
Shakespeare's not so bad; he'd have more pounds and pence in him,
If actors stood aside, and let me show the sense in him!"

          
        
      
    
  


    Louis Austin's little "Lyceum Play" was presented to me with a silver
    water-jug, a souvenir from the company, and ended up with the following
    pretty lines spoken by Katie Brown, a clever little girl who played all
    the small pages' parts at this time:


  
    
      
        
          
"Although I'm but a little page,
       Who waits for Portia's kind behest,
Mine is the part upon this stage
       To tell the plot you have not guessed.

"Dear lady, oft in Belmont's hall,
       Whose mistress is so sweet and fair,
Your humble slaves would gladly fall
       Upon their knees, and praise you there.

"To offer you this little gift,
       Dear Portia, now we crave your leave,
And let it have the grace to lift
       Our hearts to yours this Christmas eve.

"And so we pray that you may live
       Thro' many, many, happy years,
And feel what you so often give       
       The joy that is akin to tears!"

          
        
      
    
  


    How nice of Louis Austin! It quite made up for my mortification over the
    camphor pudding!


    Pittsburg has been called "hell with the lid off," and other insulting
    names. I have always thought it beautiful, especially at night when its
    furnaces make it look like a city of flame. The lovely park that the
    city has made on the heights that surround it is a lesson to Birmingham,
    Sheffield, and our other black towns. George Alexander said that
    Pittsburg reminded him of his native town of Sheffield. "Had he said
    Birmingham, now instead of Sheffield," wrote a Pittsburg newspaper man,
    "he would have touched our tender spot exactly. As it is, we can be as
    cheerful as the Chicago man was who boasted that his sweetheart 'came
    pretty near calling him "honey,"' when in fact she had called him 'Old
    Beeswax'!"


    When I played Ophelia for the first time in Chicago, I played the part
    better than I had ever played it before, and I don't believe I ever
    played it so well again. Why, it is almost impossible to say. I had
    heard a good deal of the crime of Chicago, that the people were a rough,
    murderous, sand-bagging crew. I ran on to the stage in the mad scene,
    and never have I felt such sympathy! This frail wraith, this poor
    demented thing, could hold them in the hollow of her hand.... It was
    splendid! "How long can I hold them?" I thought: "For ever!" Then I
    laughed. That was the best Ophelia laugh of my life       my life that is
    such a perfect kaleidoscope with the people and the places turning round
    and round.


    At the risk of being accused of indiscriminate flattery I must say that
    I liked all the American cities. Every one of them has a joke at the
    expense of the others. They talk in New York of a man who lost both his
    sons       "One died and the other went to live in Philadelphia." Pittsburg
    is the subject of endless criticism, and Chicago is "the limit." To me,
    indeed, it seemed "the limit"       of the industry, energy, and enterprise
    of man. In 1812 this vast city was only a frontier post       Fort Dearborn.
    In 1871 the town that first rose on these great plains was burned to the
    ground. The growth of the present Chicago began when I was a grown
    woman. I have celebrated my jubilee. Chicago will not do that for
    another fifteen years!


    I never visited the stock-yards. Somehow I had no curiosity to see a
    live pig turned in fifteen minutes into ham, sausages, hair-oil, and the
    binding for a Bible! I had some dread of being made sad by the spectacle
    of so much slaughter       of hating the Chicago of the "abattoir" as much as
    I had loved the Chicago of the Lake with the white buildings of the
    World's Fair shining on it, the Chicago built on piles in splendid
    isolation in the middle of the prairie, the Chicago of Marshall Field's
    beautiful palace of a store, the Chicago of my dear friends, the Chicago
    of my son's first appearance on the stage! Was it not a Chicago man who
    wrote of my boy, tending the roses in the stage garden in "Eugene Aram,"
    that he was "a most beautiful lad"!


  
                   "His eyes are full of sparkle, his smile is a ripple over his face, and his laugh is as cherry and natural as a bird's song.... This Joey is Miss Ellen Terry's son, and the apple of her eye. On this Wednesday night, January 14, 1885, he spoke his first lines upon the stage. His mother has high hopes of this child's dramatic future. He has the instinct and the soul of art in him. Already the theater is his home. His postures and his playfulness with the gardener, his natural and graceful movement, had been the subject of much drilling, of study and practice. He acquitted himself beautifully and received the wise congratulations of his mother, of Mr. Irving, and of the company."

  


    That is the nicest newspaper notice I have ever read!


    At Chicago I made my first speech. The Haverley Theater, at which we
    first appeared in 1884, was altered and rechristened the "Columbia" in
    1885. I was called upon for a speech after the special performance in
    honor of the occasion, consisting of scenes from "Charles I.," "Louis
    XI," "The Merchant of Venice," and "The Bells," had come to an end. I
    think it must be the shortest speech on record:


  
"Ladies and Gentlemen, I have been asked to christen your beautiful theater. 'Hail Columbia!'"

  


    When we acted in Brooklyn we used to stay in New York and drive over
    that wonderful bridge every night. There were no trolley cars on it
    then. I shall never forget how it looked in winter, with the snow and
    ice on it       a gigantic trellis of dazzling white, as incredible as a
    dream. The old stone bridges were works of art. This bridge, woven of
    iron and steel for a length of over 500 yards, and hung high in the air
    over the water so that great ships can pass beneath it, is the work of
    science. It looks as if it had been built by some power, not by men at
    all.


    It was during our week at Brooklyn in 1885 that Henry was ill, too ill
    to act for four nights. Alexander played Benedick, and got through it
    wonderfully well. Then old Mr. Mead did (did is the word) Shylock.
    There was no intention behind his words or what he did.


    I had such a funny batch of letters on my birthday that year. "Dear,
    sweet Miss Terry, etc., etc. Will you give me a piano?"!! etc., etc.
    Another: "Dear Ellen. Come to Jesus. Mary." Another, a lovely letter of
    thanks from a poor woman in the most ghastly distress, and lastly an
    offer of a two years' engagement in America. There was a simple coming
    in for one woman acting at Brooklyn on her birthday!


    Brooklyn is as sure a laugh in New York as the mother-in-law in a London
    music hall. "All cities begin by being lonesome," a comedian explained,
    "and Brooklyn has never gotten over it."


    My only complaint against Brooklyn was that they would not take
    Fussie
    in at the hotel there. Fussie, during these early American tours, was
    still my dog. Later on he became Henry's. He had his affections
    alienated by a course of chops, tomatoes, strawberries, "ladies'
    fingers" soaked in champagne, and a beautiful fur rug of his very own
    presented by the Baroness Burdett-Coutts!


    How did I come by Fussie? I went to Newmarket with Rosa Corder, whom
    Whistler painted. She was one of those plain-beautiful women who are so
    far more attractive than some of the pretty ones. She had wonderful
    hair       like a fair, pale veil, a white, waxen face, and a very good
    figure; and she wore very odd clothes. She had a studio in Southampton
    Row, and another at Newmarket where she went to paint horses. I went to
    Cambridge once and drove back with her across the heath to her studio.

          

    
    

          

    MISS ROSA CORDER

    From the painting by James McNeill Whistler

          

    "How wonderfully different are the expressions on terriers' faces," I
    said to her, looking at a painting of hers of a fox-terrier pup. "That's
    the only sort of dog I should like to have."


    "That one belonged to Fred Archer," Rosa Corder said. "I daresay he
    could get you one like it."


    We went out to find Archer. Curiously enough I had known the famous
    jockey at Harpenden when he was a little boy, and I believe used to come
    round with vegetables.


    "I'll send you a dog, Miss Terry, that won't be any trouble. He's got a
    very good head, a first-rate tail, stuck in splendidly, but his legs are
    too long. He'd follow you to America!"


    Prophetic words! On one of our departures for America, Fussie was left
    behind by mistake at Southampton. He could not get across the Atlantic,
    but he did the next best thing. He found his way back from there to his
    own theater in the Strand, London!


    Fred Archer sent him originally to the stage-door at the Lyceum. The man
    who brought him out from there to my house in Earl's Court said:


    "I'm afraid he gives tongue, Miss. He don't like music, anyway. There
    was a band at the bottom of your road, and he started hollering."


          

    
    

          

    ELLEN TERRY

    With her fox-terriers, Dummy and Fussie; from a photograph taken in 1889

          

    We were at luncheon when Fussie made his début into the family circle,
    and I very quickly saw his stomach was his fault. He had a great
    dislike to "Charles I."; we could never make out why. Perhaps it was
    because Henry wore armor in one act       and Fussie may have barked his
    shins against it. Perhaps it was the firing off of the guns; but more
    probably it was because the play once got him into trouble. As a rule
    Fussie had the most wonderful sense of the stage, and at rehearsal would
    skirt the edge of it, but never cross it. But at Brooklyn one night when
    we were playing "Charles I."       the last act, and that most pathetic part
    of it where Charles is taking a last farewell of his wife and
    children       Fussie, perhaps excited by his run over the bridge from New
    York, suddenly bounded on to the stage! The good children who were
    playing Princess Mary and Prince Henry didn't even smile; the audience
    remained solemn, but Henry and I nearly went into hysterics. Fussie knew
    directly that he had done wrong. He lay down on his stomach, then rolled
    over on his back, whimpering an apology       while carpenters kept on
    whistling and calling to him from the wings. The children took him up to
    the window at the back of the scene, and he stayed there cowering
    between them until the end of the play.


    America seems to have been always fatal to Fussie. Another time when
    Henry and I were playing in some charity performance in which
    John Drew
    and Maude Adams were also acting, he disgraced himself again. Henry
    having "done his bit" and put on hat and coat to leave the theater, Fussie thought the end of the performance must have come; the stage had
    no further sanctity for him, and he ran across it to the stage door
    barking! John Drew and Maude Adams were playing "A Pair of Lunatics."
    Maude Adams, sitting looking into the fire, did not see Fussie, but was
    amazed to hear John Drew departing madly from the text:


  
    
      
        
          
            
              
"Is this a dog I see before me,
His tail towards my hand?
Come, let me clutch thee."
              
            
          
        
      
    
  


    She began to think that he had really gone mad!


    When Fussie first came, Charlie was still alive, and I have often gone
    into Henry's dressing-room and seen the two dogs curled up in both the
    available chairs, Henry standing while he made up, rather than disturb
    them!


    When Charlie died, Fussie had Henry's idolatry all to himself. I have
    caught them often sitting quietly opposite each other at Grafton Street,
    just adoring each other! Occasionally Fussie would thump his tail on the
    ground to express his pleasure.


    Wherever we went in America the hotel people wanted to get rid of the
    dog. In the paper they had it that Miss Terry asserted that Fussie was a
    little terrier, while the hotel people regarded him as a pointer, and
    funny caricatures were drawn of a very big me with a very tiny dog, and
    a very tiny me with a dog the size of an elephant! Henry often walked
    straight out of an hotel where an objection was made to Fussie. If he
    wanted to stay, he had recourse to strategy. At Detroit the manager of
    the hotel said that dogs were against the rules. Being very tired Henry
    let Fussie go to the stables for the night, and sent Walter to look
    after him. The next morning he sent for the manager.


    "Yours is a very old-fashioned hotel, isn't it?"


    "Yes, sir, very old and ancient."


    "Got a good chef? I didn't think much of the supper last night; but
    still       the beds are comfortable enough       I am afraid you don't like
    animals?"


    "Yes, sir, in their proper place."


    "It's a pity," said Henry meditatively, "because you happen to be
    overrun by rats!"


    "Sir, you must have made a mistake. Such a thing couldn't       "


    "Well, I couldn't pass another night here without my dog," Henry
    interrupted. "But there are, I suppose, other hotels?"


    "If it will be any comfort to you to have your dog with you, sir, do by
    all means, but I assure you that he'll catch no rat here."


    "I'll be on the safe side," said Henry calmly.


    And so it was settled. That very night Fussie supped off, not rats, but
    terrapin and other delicacies in Henry's private sitting-room.


    It was the 1888 tour, the great blizzard year, that Fussie was left
    behind by mistake at Southampton. He jumped out at the station just
    before Southampton, where they stop to collect tickets. After this long
    separation, Henry naturally thought that the dog would go nearly mad
    with joy when he saw him again. He described to me the meeting in a
    letter.


  
                   "My dear Fussie gave me a terrible shock on Sunday night. When we got in, J              , Hatton, and I dined at the Cafe Royal. I told Walter to bring Fussie there. He did, and Fussie burst into the room while the waiter was cutting some mutton, when, what d'ye think       one bound at me       another instantaneous bound at the mutton, and from the mutton nothing would get him until he'd got his plateful.

                  
"Oh, what a surprise it was indeed! He never now will leave my side, my legs, or my presence, but I cannot but think, alas, of that seductive piece of mutton!"

  


    Poor Fussie! He met his death through the same weakness. It was at
    Manchester, I think. A carpenter had thrown down his coat with a ham
    sandwich in the pocket, over an open trap on the stage. Fussie, nosing
    and nudging after the sandwich, fell through and was killed instantly.
    When they brought up the dog after the performance, every man took his
    hat off.... Henry was not told until the end of the play.


    He took it so very quietly that I was frightened, and said to his son
    Laurence who was on that tour:


    "Do let's go to his hotel and see how he is."


    We drove there and found him sitting eating his supper with the poor
    dead Fussie, who would never eat supper any more, curled up in his rug
    on the sofa. Henry was talking to the dog exactly as if it were alive.
    The next day he took Fussie back in the train with him to London,
    covered with a coat. He is buried in the dogs' cemetery, Hyde Park.


    His death made an enormous difference to Henry. Fussie was his constant
    companion. When he died, Henry was really alone. He never spoke of what
    he felt about it, but it was easy to know.


    We used to get hints how to get this and that from watching Fussie! His
    look, his way of walking! He sang, whispered eloquently and low       then
    barked suddenly and whispered again! Such a lesson in the law of
    contrasts!


    The first time that Henry went to the Lyceum after Fussie's death, every
    one was anxious and distressed, knowing how he would miss the dog in his
    dressing-room. Then an odd thing happened. The wardrobe cat, who had
    never been near the room in Fussie's lifetime, came down and sat on
    Fussie's cushion! No one knew how the "Governor" would take it. But when
    Walter was sent out to buy some meat for it, we saw that Henry was not
    going to resent it! From that night onwards the cat always sat night
    after night in the same place, and Henry liked its companionship. In
    1902, when he left the theater for good, he wrote to me:


  
                   "The place is now given up to the rats       all light cut off, and only Barry11 and a foreman left. Everything of mine I've moved away, including the Cat!"

  


    I have never been to America yet without going to Niagara. The first
    time I saw the great falls I thought it all more wonderful than
    beautiful. I got away by myself from my party, and looked and looked at
    it, and I listened       and at last it became dreadful and I was
    frightened at it. I wouldn't go alone again, for I felt queer and
    wanted to follow the great flow of it. But at twelve o'clock, with the
    "sun upon the topmost height of the day's journey," most of Nature's
    sights appear to me to be at their plainest. In the evening, when the
    shadows grow long and all hard lines are blurred, how soft, how
    different, everything is! It was noontide, that garish cruel time of
    day, when I first came in sight of the falls. I'm glad I went again in
    other lights       but one should live by the side of all this greatness to
    learn to love it. Only once did I catch Niagara in beauty, with pits
    of color in its waters, no one color definite       all was wonderment,
    allurement, fascination. The last time I was there it was wonderful,
    but not beautiful any more. The merely stupendous, the merely marvelous,
    have always repelled me. I cannot realize, and become terribly weak
    and doddering. No terrific scene gives me pleasure. The great cañons
    give me unrest, just as the long low lines of my Sussex marshland near
    Winchelsea give me rest.

          

    
    

          

    MISS TERRY'S GARDEN AT WINCHELSEA

    From a photograph given by her to Miss Evelyn Smalley

          

    At Niagara William Terriss slipped and nearly lost his life. At night
    when he appeared as Bassanio, he shrugged his shoulders, lowered his
    eyelids, and said to me       


    "Nearly gone, dear,"       he would call everybody "dear"       "But Bill's luck!
    Tempus fugit!"


    What tempus had to do with it, I don't quite know!


    When we were first in Canada I tobogganed at Rosedale. I should say it
    was like flying! The start! Amazing! "Farewell to this world," I
    thought, as I felt my breath go. Then I shut my mouth, opened my eyes,
    and found myself at the bottom of the hill in a jiffy       "over hill, over
    dale, through bush, through briar!" I rolled right out of the toboggan
    when we stopped. A very nice Canadian man was my escort, and he helped
    me up the hill afterwards. I didn't like that part of the affair quite
    so much.


    Henry Irving would not come, much to my disappointment. He said that
    quick motion through the air always gave him the ear-ache. He had to
    give up swimming (his old Cornish Aunt Penberthy told me he delighted in
    swimming as a boy) just because it gave him most violent pains in the
    ear.


    Philadelphia, as I first knew it, was the most old-world place I saw in
    America, except perhaps Salem. Its redbrick side-walks, the trees in the
    streets, the low houses with their white marble cuffs and collars, the
    pretty design of the place, all give it a character of its own. The
    people, too, have a character of their own. They dress, or at least
    did dress, very quietly. This was the only sign of their Quaker
    origin, except a very fastidious taste       in plays as in other things.


    Mrs. Gillespie, the great-grandchild of Benjamin Franklin, was one of my
    earliest Philadelphia friends       a splendid type of the independent woman,
    a bit of the martinet, but immensely full of kindness and humor. She had
    a word to say in all Philadelphian matters. It would be difficult to
    imagine a greater contrast to Mrs. Gillespie of Philadelphia than
    Mrs.
    Fields of Boston, that other great American lady whom to know is a
    liberal education.


    Mrs. Fields reminded me of Lady Tennyson, Mrs. Tom Taylor, and Miss
    Hogarth (Dickens's sister-in-law) all rolled into one. Her house is full
    of relics of the past. There is a portrait of Dickens as a young man
    with long hair. He had a feminine face in those days, for all its
    strength. Hard by is a sketch of Keats by Severn, with a lock of the
    poet's hair. Opposite is a head of Thackeray, with a note in his
    handwriting fastened below. "Good-bye, Mrs. Fields; good-bye, my dear
    Fields; good-bye to all. I go home."


    Thackeray left Boston abruptly because a sudden desire to see his
    children had assailed him at Christmas time!


    As you sit in Mrs. Field's spacious room overlooking the Bay, you
    realize suddenly that before you ever came into it, Dickens and
    Thackeray were both here, that this beautiful old lady who so kindly
    smiles on you has smiled on them and on many other great men of letters
    long since dead. It is here that they seem most alive. This is the house
    where the culture of Boston seems no fad to make a joke about, but a
    rare and delicate reality.


    This       and Fen Court, the home of that wonderful woman
    Mrs. Jack
    Gardiner, who represents the present worship of beauty in Boston as Mrs.
    Fields represents its former worship of literary men. Fen Court is a
    house of enchantment, a palace, and Mrs. Gardiner is like a great
    princess in it. She has "great possessions" indeed, but her best, to my
    mind, is her most beautiful voice, even though I remember her garden by
    moonlight with the fountain playing, her books and her pictures, the Sargent portrait of herself presiding over one of the most splendid of
    those splendid rooms, where everything great in old art and new art is
    represented. What a portrait it is! Some one once said of Sargent that
    "behind the individual he finds the real, and behind the real, a whole
    social order."


    He has painted "Mrs. Jack" in a tight-fitting black dress with no
    ornament but her world-famed pearl necklace round her waist, and on her
    shoes rubies like drops of blood. The daring, intellectual face seems to
    say: "I have possessed everything that is worth possession, through the
    energy and effort and labor of the country in which I was born."


    Mrs. Gardiner represents all the poetry of the millionaire.


    Mrs. Gardiner's house filled me with admiration, but if I want rest and
    peace I just think of the houses of Mrs. James Fields and Oliver Wendell
    Holmes. He was another personage in Boston life when I first went there.
    Oh, the visits I inflicted on him       yet he always seemed pleased to see
    me, the cheery, kind man. It was generally winter when I called on him.
    At once it was "four feet upon a fender!" Four feet upon a fender was
    his idea of happiness, he told me, during one of these lengthy visits of
    mine to his house in Beacon Street.


    He came to see us in "Much Ado about Nothing" and, next day sent me some
    little volumes of his work with a lovely inscription on the front page.
    I miss him very much when I go to Boston now.

          

    
    

          

    MISS ELLEN TERRY IN 1898

    From the collection of Miss Evelyn Smalley

    Photographed by T.R. Annan

          

    In New York, how much I miss Mrs. Beecher I could never say. The
    Beechers were the most wonderful pair. What an actor he would have made!
    He read scenes from Shakespeare to Henry and me at luncheon one day. He
    sat next to his wife, and they held hands nearly all the while; I
    thought of that time when the great preacher was tried, and all through
    the trial his wife showed the world her faith in his innocence by
    sitting by his side and holding his hand.


    He was indeed a great preacher. I have a little faded card in my
    possession now: "Mrs. Henry W. Beecher." "Will ushers of Plymouth Church
    please seat the bearer in the Pastor's pew." And in the Pastor's pew I
    sat, listening to that magnificent bass-viol voice with its persuasive
    low accent, its torrential scorn! After the sermon I went to the
    Beechers' home. Mr. Beecher sat with a saucer of uncut gems by him on
    the table. He ran his hand through them from time to time, held them up
    to the light, admiring them and speaking of their beauty and color as
    eloquently as an hour before he had spoken of sin and death and
    redemption.


    He asked me to choose a stone, and I selected an aquamarine, and he had
    it splendidly mounted for me in Venetian style to wear in "The Merchant
    of Venice." Once when he was ill, he told me, his wife had some few
    score of his jewels set up in lead       a kind of small stained-glass
    window       and hung up opposite his bed. "It did me more good than the
    doctor's visits," he laughed out!


    Mrs. Beecher was very remarkable. She had a way of lowering her head and
    looking at you with a strange intentness       gravely       kindly and quietly.
    At her husband she looked a world of love, of faith, of undying
    devotion. She was fond of me, although I was told she disliked women
    generally and had been brought up to think all actresses children of
    Satan. Obedience to the iron rules which had always surrounded her had
    endowed her with extraordinary self-control. She would not allow herself
    ever to feel heat or cold, and could stand any pain or discomfort
    without a word of complaint.


    She told me once that when she and her sister were children, a friend
    had given them some lovely bright blue silk, and as the material was so
    fine they thought they would have it made up a little more smartly than
    was usual in their somber religious home. In spite of their father's
    hatred of gaudy clothes, they ventured on a little "V" at the neck,
    hardly showing more than the throat; but still, in a household where
    blue silk itself was a crime, it was a bold venture. They put on the
    dresses for the first time for five o'clock dinner, stole downstairs
    with trepidation, rather late, and took their seats as usual one on each
    side of their father. He was eating soup and never looked up. The little
    sisters were relieved. He was not going to say anything.


    No, he was not going to say anything, but suddenly he took a ladleful of
    the hot soup and dashed it over the neck of one sister; another ladleful
    followed quickly on the neck of the other.


    "Oh, father, you've burned my neck!"


    "Oh, father, you've spoiled my dress!"


    "Oh, father, why did you do that?"


    "I thought you might be cold," said the severe father
    significantly       malevolently.


    That a woman who had been brought up like this should form a friendship
    with me naturally caused a good deal of talk. But what did she care! She
    remained my true friend until her death, and wrote to me constantly when
    I was in England       such loving, wise letters, full of charity and simple
    faith. In 1889, after her husband's death, I wrote to her and sent my
    picture, and she replied:

                   "My darling Nellie,       

                  
"You cannot know how it soothes my extreme heart-loneliness to receive a token of remembrance, and word of cheer from those I have faithfully loved, and who knew and reverenced my husband.... Ellen Terry is very sweet as Ellaline, but dearer far as my Nellie."


    The Daly players were a revelation to me of the pitch of excellence
    which American acting had reached. My first night at Daly's was a night
    of enchantment. I wrote to Mr. Daly and said: "You've got a girl in your
    company who is the most lovely, humorous darling I have ever seen on the
    stage." It was Ada Rehan! Now of course I didn't "discover" her or any
    rubbish of that kind; the audience were already mad about her, but I did
    know her for what she was, even in that brilliant "all-star" company and
    before she had played in the classics and won enduring fame. The
    audacious, superb, quaint, Irish creature! Never have I seen such
    splendid high comedy! Then the charm of her voice       a little like
    Ethel
    Barrymore's when Miss Ethel is speaking very nicely       her smiles and
    dimples, and provocative, inviting coquetterie! Her Rosalind, her
    Country Wife, her Helena, her performance in "The Railroad of Love"! And
    above all, her Katherine in "The Taming of the Shrew"! I can only
    exclaim, not explain! Directly she came on I knew how she was going to
    do the part. She had such shy, demure fun. She understood, like all
    great comedians, that you must not pretend to be serious so sincerely
    that no one in the audience sees through it!


    As a woman off the stage Ada Rehan was even more wonderful than as a
    shrew on. She had a touch of dignity, of nobility, of beauty, rather
    like Eleonora Duse's. The mouth and the formation of the eye were
    lovely. Her guiltlessness of make-up off the stage was so attractive!
    She used to come in to a supper with a lovely shining face which scorned
    a powder puff. The only thing one missed was the red hair which seemed
    such a part of her on the stage.


    Here is a dear letter from the dear, written in 1890:

                   "My dear Miss Terry,       

                  
"Of course the first thing I was to do when I reached Paris was to write and thank you for your lovely red feathers. One week is gone. To-day it rains and I am compelled to stay at home, and at last I write. I thought you had forgotten me and my feathers long ago. So imagine my delight when they came at the very end. I liked it so. It seemed as if I lived all the time in your mind: and they came as a good-bye.

                  
"I saw but little of you, but in that little I found no change. That was gratifying to me, for I am over-sensitive, and would never trouble you if you had forgotten me. How I shall prize those feathers       Henry Irving's, presented by Ellen Terry to me for my Rosalind Cap. I shall wear them once and then put them by as treasures. Thank you so much for the pretty words you wrote me about 'As You Like It.' I was hardly fit on that matinée. The great excitement I went through during the London season almost killed me. I am going to try and rest, but I fear my nerves and heart won't let me.

                  
"You must try and read between the lines all I feel. I am sure you can if any one ever did, but I cannot put into words my admiration for you       and that comes from deep down in my heart. Good-bye, with all good wishes for your health and success.

                  
"I remain

                  
"Yours most affectionately,

                  
"ADA REHAN."


    I wish I could just once have played with Ada Rehan. When Mr. Tree could
    not persuade Mrs. Kendal to come and play in "The Merry Wives of
    Windsor" a second time, I hoped that Ada Rehan would come and rollick
    with me as Mrs. Ford       but it was not to be.


    Mr. Daly himself interested me greatly. He was an excellent manager, a
    man in a million. But he had no artistic sense. The productions of
    Shakespeare at Daly's were really bad from the pictorial point of view.
    But what pace and "ensemble" he got from his company!


    May Irwin was the low comedian who played the servants' parts in Daly's
    comedies from the German. I might describe her, except that she was far
    more genial, as a kind of female Rutland Barrington. On and off the
    stage her geniality distinguished her like a halo. It is a rare quality
    on the stage, yet without it the comedian has uphill work. I should say
    that May Irwin and J.B. Buckstone (the English actor and manager of the
    Haymarket Theater during the 'sixties) had it equally. Generous May
    Irwin! Lucky those who have her warm friendship and jolly, kind
    companionship!


    John Drew, the famous son of a famous mother, was another Daly player
    whom I loved. With what loyalty he supported Ada Rehan! He never played
    for his own hand but for the good of the piece. His mother,
    Mrs. John
    Drew, had the same quiet methods as Mrs. Alfred Wigan. Everything that
    she did told. I saw Mrs. Drew play Mrs. Malaprop, and it was a lesson to
    people who overact. Her daughter, Georgie Drew, Ethel Barrymore's
    mother, was also a charming actress. Maurice Barrymore was a brilliantly
    clever actor. Little Ethel, as I still call her, though she is a big
    "star," is carrying on the family traditions. She ought to play Lady Teazle. She may take it from me that she would make a success in it.


    Modjeska, who, though she is a Polish actress, lives in America and is
    associated with the American stage, made a great impression on me. She
    was exquisite in many parts, but in none finer than in "Adrienne
    Lecouvreur." Her last act electrified me. I have never seen it better
    acted, although I have seen all the great ones do it since. Her Marie
    Stuart, too, was a beautiful and distinguished performance. Her Juliet
    had lovely moments, but I did not so much care for that, and her broken
    English interfered with the verse of Shakespeare. Some years ago I met
    Modjeska and she greeted me so warmly and sweetly, although she was very
    ill.


    During my more recent tours in America Maude Adams is the actress of
    whom I have seen most, and "to see her is to love her!" In "The Little
    Minister" and in "Quality Street" I think she is at her best, but above
    all parts she herself is most adorable. She is just worshiped in
    America, and has an extraordinary effect       an educational effect upon
    all American girlhood.


    I never saw Mary Anderson act. That seems a strange admission, but
    during her wonderful reign at the Lyceum Theater, which she rented from
    Henry Irving, I was in America, and another time when I might have seen
    her act I was very ill and ordered abroad. I have, however, had the
    great pleasure of meeting her, and she has done me many little
    kindnesses. Hearing her praises sung on all sides, and her beauties
    spoken of everywhere, I was particularly struck by her modest evasion of
    publicity off the stage. I personally only knew her as a most
    beautiful woman       as kind as beautiful       constantly working for her
    religion       always kind, a good daughter, a good wife, a good woman.


    She cheered me before I first sailed for America by saying that her
    people would like me.


    "Since seeing you in Portia and Letitia," she wrote, "I am convinced you
    will take America by storm." Certainly she took England by storm!
    But she abandoned her triumphs almost as soon as they were gained. They
    never made her happy, she once told me, and I could understand her
    better than most since I had had success too, and knew that it did not
    mean happiness. I have a letter from her, written from St. Raphael soon
    after her marriage. It is nice to think that she is just as happy now as
    she was then       that she made no mistake when she left the stage, where
    she had such a brief and brilliant career.

                   "GRAND HOTEL DE VALESCURE,

"Dear Miss Terry,       

                  
"I am saying all kinds of fine things about your beautiful work in my book       which will appear shortly; but I cannot remember the name of the small part you made so attractive in the 'Lyons Mail.' It was the first one I had seen you in, and I wish to write my delightful impressions of it.

                  
"Will you be so very kind as to tell me the name of your character and the two Mr. Irving acted so wonderfully in that play?

    SIR HENRY IRVING

    From a portrait given by him to Miss Evelyn Smalley in 1896

          

    Henry and I were so fortunate as to gain the friendship and approval of
    Dr. Horace Howard Furness, perhaps the finest Shakespearean scholar in
    America, and editor of the "Variorum Shakespeare," which Henry
    considered the best of all editions       "the one which counts." It was in
    Boston, I think, that I disgraced myself at one of Dr. Furness's
    lectures. He was discussing "As You Like It" and Rosalind, and proving
    with much elaboration that English in Shakespeare's time was pronounced
    like a broad country dialect, and that Rosalind spoke Warwickshire! A
    little girl who was sitting in the row in front of me had lent me her
    copy of the play a moment before, and now, absorbed in Dr. Furness's
    argument, I forgot the book wasn't mine and began scrawling
    controversial notes in it with my very thick and blotty fountain pen.


    "Give me back my book! Give me my book!" screamed the little girl. "How
    dare you write in my book!" She began to cry with rage.


    Her mother tried to hush her up: "Don't, darling. Be quiet! It's Miss
    Ellen Terry."


    "I don't care! She's spoilt my nice book!"


    I am glad to say that when the little girl understood, she forgave me;
    and the spoilt book is treasured very much by a tall Boston young lady
    of eighteen who has replaced the child of seven years ago! Still, it was
    dreadful of me, and I did feel ashamed at the time.


    I saw "As You Like It" acted in New York once with every part (except
    the man who let down the curtain) played by a woman, and it was
    extraordinarily well done. The most remarkable bit of acting was by
    Janauschek, who played Jacques. I have never heard the speech beginning
    "All the world's a stage" delivered more finely, not even by Phelps, who
    was fine in the part.


    Mary Shaw's Rosalind was good, and the Silvius (who played it, now?) was
    charming.


    Unfortunately that one man, poor creature (no wonder he was nervous!),
    spoiled the end of the play by failing to ring down the curtain, at
    which the laughter was immoderate! Janauschek used to do a little sketch
    from the German called "Come Here!" which I afterwards did in England.


    In November, 1901, I wrote in my diary: "Philadelphia.       Supper at
    Henry's. Jefferson there, sweeter and more interesting than ever       and
    younger."


    Dear Joe Jefferson       actor, painter, courteous gentleman, profound
    student of Shakespeare! When the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy was
    raging in America (it really did rage there!) Jefferson wrote the most
    delicious doggerel about it. He ridiculed, and his ridicule killed the
    Bacon enthusiasts all the more dead because it was barbed with
    erudition.


    He said that when I first came into the box to see him as "Rip" he
    thought I did not like him, because I fidgeted and rustled and moved my
    place, as is my wicked way. "But I'll get her, and I'll hold her," he
    said to himself. I was held indeed       enthralled.


    In manner Jefferson was a little like Norman Forbes-Robertson. Perhaps
    that was why the two took such a fancy to each other. When Norman was
    walking with Jefferson one day, some one who met them said:


    "Your son?"


    "No," said Jefferson, "but I wish he were! The young man has such good
    manners!"


    Our first American tours were in 1883 and 1884; the third in 1887-88,
    the year of the great blizzard. Henry fetched us at half-past ten in the
    morning! His hotel was near the theater where we were to play at night.
    He said the weather was stormy, and we had better make for his hotel
    while there was time! The German actor Ludwig Barnay was to open in New
    York that night, but the blizzard affected his nerves to such an extent
    that he did not appear at all, and returned to Germany directly the
    weather improved!


    Most of the theaters closed for three days, but we remained open,
    although there was a famine in the town and the streets were impassable.
    The cold was intense. Henry sent Walter out to buy some violets for
    Barnay, and when he brought them in to the dressing room       he had only
    carried them a few yards       they were frozen so hard that they could have
    been chipped with a hammer!


    We rang up on "Faust" three-quarters of an hour late! This was not bad
    considering all things. Although the house was sold out, there was
    hardly any audience, and only a harp and two violins in the orchestra.
    Discipline was so strong in the Lyceum company that every member of it
    reached the theater by eight o'clock, although some of them had had to
    walk from Brooklyn Bridge.


    The Mayor of New York and his daughter managed to reach their box
    somehow. Then we thought it was time to begin. Some members of Daly's
    company, including John Drew, came in, and a few friends. It was the
    oddest, scantiest audience! But the enthusiasm was terrific!


    Five years went by before we visited America again. Five years in a
    country of rapid changes is a long time, long enough for friends to
    forget! But they didn't forget. This time we made new friends, too, in
    the Far West. We went to San Francisco, among other places. We attended
    part of a performance at the Chinese theater. Oh, those rows of
    impenetrable faces gazing at the stage with their long, shining,
    inexpressive eyes! What a look of the everlasting the Chinese have! "We
    have been before you       we shall be after you," they seem to say.


    Just as we were getting interested in the play, the interpreter rose and
    hurried us out. Something that was not for the ears of women was being
    said, but we did not know it!


    The chief incident of the fifth American tour was our production at
    Chicago of Laurence Irving's one-act play "Godefroi and Yolande." I
    regard that little play as an inspiration. By instinct the young author
    did everything right. The Chicago folk, in spite of the unpleasant theme
    of the play, recognized the genius of it, and received it splendidly.


    In 1901 I was ill, and hated the parts I was playing in America. The
    Lyceum was not what it had been. Everything was changed.


    In 1907       only the other day       I toured in America for the first time on
    my own account       playing modern plays for the first time. I made new
    friends and found my old ones still faithful.


    But this tour was chiefly momentous to me because at Pittsburg I was
    married for the third time, and married to an American. My marriage was
    my own affair, but very few people seemed to think so, and I was
    overwhelmed with "inquiries," kind and otherwise. Kindness and loyalty
    won the day. "If any one deserves to be happy, you do," many a friend
    wrote. Well, I am happy, and while I am happy, I cannot feel old.

    XIII
    THE MACBETH PERIOD


    Perhaps Henry Irving and I might have gone on with Shakespeare to the
    end of the chapter if he had not been in such a hurry to produce
    "Macbeth."


    We ought to have done "As You Like It" in 1888, or "The Tempest." Henry
    thought of both these plays. He was much attracted by the part of
    Caliban in "The Tempest," but, he said, "the young lovers are
    everything, and where are we going to find them?" He would have played
    Touchstone in "As You Like It," not Jacques, because Touchstone is in
    the vital part of the play.


    He might have delayed both "Macbeth" and "Henry VIII." He ought to have
    added to his list of Shakespearean productions "Julius Caesar," "King
    John," "As You Like It," "Antony and Cleopatra," "Richard II.," and
    "Timon of Athens." There were reasons "against," of course. In "Julius
    Caesar" he wanted to play Brutus. "That's the part for the actor," he
    said, "because it needs acting. But the actor-manager's part is
    Antony       Antony scores all along the line. Now when the actor and
    actor-manager fight in a play, and when there is no part for you in it,
    I think it's wiser to leave it alone."


    Every one knows when the luck first began to turn against Henry Irving.
    It was in 1896 when he revived "Richard III." On the first night he
    went home, slipped on the stairs in Grafton Street, broke a bone in his
    knee, aggravated the hurt by walking on it, and had to close the
    theater. It was that year, too, that his general health began to fail.
    For the ten years preceding his death he carried on an indomitable
    struggle against ill-health. Lungs and heart alike were weak. Only the
    spirit in that frail body remained as strong as ever. Nothing could bend
    it, much less break it.


    But I have not come to that sad time yet.


    "We all know when we do our best," said Henry once. "We are the only
    people who know." Yet he thought he did better in "Macbeth" than in
    "Hamlet"!


    Was he right after all?


    His view of "Macbeth," though attacked and derided and put to shame in
    many quarters, is as clear to me as the sunlight itself. To me it seems
    as stupid to quarrel with the conception as to deny the nose on one's
    face. But the carrying out of the conception was unequal. Henry's
    imagination was sometimes his worst enemy.


    When I think of his "Macbeth," I remember him most distinctly in the
    last act after the battle when he looked like a great famished wolf,
    weak with the weakness of a giant exhausted, spent as one whose
    exertions have been ten times as great as those of commoner men of
    rougher fiber and coarser strength.

"Of all men else I have avoided thee."


    Once more he suggested, as he only could suggest, the power of Fate.
    Destiny seemed to hang over him, and he knew that there was no hope, no
    mercy.


    The rehearsals for "Macbeth" were very exhausting, but they were
    splendid to watch. In this play Henry brought his manipulation of crowds
    to perfection. My acting edition of the play is riddled with rough
    sketches by him of different groups. Artists to whom I have shown them
    have been astonished by the spirited impressionism of these sketches.
    For his "purpose" Henry seems to have been able to do anything, even to
    drawing, and composing music! Sir Arthur Sullivan's music at first did
    not quite please him. He walked up and down the stage humming, and
    showing the composer what he was going to do at certain situations.
    Sullivan, with wonderful quickness and open-mindedness, caught his
    meaning at once.


    "Much better than mine, Irving       much better       I'll rough it out at once!"


    When the orchestra played the new version, based on that humming of
    Henry's, it was exactly what he wanted!


    Knowing what a task I had before me, I began to get anxious and worried
    about "Lady Mac." Henry wrote me such a nice letter about this:


  
                   "To-night, if possible, the last act. I want to get these great multitudinous scenes over and then we can attack our scenes.... Your sensitiveness is so acute that you must suffer sometimes. You are not like anybody else       see things with such lightning quickness and unerring instinct that dull fools like myself grow irritable and impatient sometimes. I feel confused when I'm thinking of one thing, and disturbed by another. That's all. But I do feel very sorry afterwards when I don't seem to heed what I so much value....

                  
"I think things are going well, considering the time we've been at it, but I see so much that is wanting that it seems almost impossible to get through properly. 'To-night commence, Matthias. If you sleep, you are lost!'"12

  


    At this time we were able to be of the right use to each other. Henry
    could never have worked with a very strong woman. I might have
    deteriorated, in partnership with a weaker man whose ends were less
    fine, whose motives were less pure. I had the taste and artistic
    knowledge that his upbringing had not developed in him. For years he did
    things to please me. Later on I gave up asking him. In "King Lear"
    Mrs. Nettleship made him a most beautiful cloak, but he insisted on wearing a
    brilliant purple velvet cloak with spangles all over it which swamped
    his beautiful make-up and his beautiful acting. Poor Mrs. Nettleship was
    almost in tears.


    "I'll never make you anything again       never!"


    One of Mrs. "Nettle's" greatest triumphs was my Lady Macbeth dress,
    which she carried out from Mrs. Comyns Carr's design. I am glad to think
    it is immortalized in Sargent's picture. From the first I knew that
    picture was going to be splendid. In my diary for 1888 I was always
    writing about it:


  
                   "The picture of me is nearly finished, and I think it magnificent. The green and blue of the dress is splendid, and the expression as Lady Macbeth holds the crown over her head is quite wonderful.

                  
"Henschel is sitting to Sargent. His concerts, I hear, can't be carried on another year for want of funds. What a shame!

                  
"Mr. Sargent is painting a head of Henry       very good, but mean about the chin at present.

                  
"Sargent's picture is talked of everywhere and quarreled about as much as my way of playing the part.

                  
"Sargent's 'Lady Macbeth' in the New Gallery is a great success. The picture is the sensation of the year. Of course opinions differ about it, but there are dense crowds round it day after day. There is talk of putting it on exhibition by itself."
      
      



      
  


    ELLEN TERRY AS LADY MACBETH

    From the painting by Sargent, in the Tate Gallery, London

          

    Since then it has gone over nearly the whole of Europe, and now is
    resting for life at the Tate Gallery. Sargent suggested by this picture
    all that I should have liked to be able to convey in my acting as Lady
    Macbeth.


  
                        My Diary.       "Everybody hates Sargent's head of Henry. Henry also. I like it, but not altogether. I think it perfectly wonderfully painted and like him, only not at his best by any means. There sat Henry and there by his side the picture, and I could scarce tell one from t'other. Henry looked white, with tired eyes, and holes in his cheeks and bored to death! And there was the picture with white face, tired eyes, holes in the cheeks and boredom in every line. Sargent tried to paint his smile and gave it up."

  


    Sargent said to me, I remember, upon Henry Irving's first visit to the
    studio to see the Macbeth picture of me, "What a Saint!" This to my mind
    promised well       that Sargent should see that side of Henry so swiftly.
    So then I never left off asking Henry to sit to Sargent, who wanted to
    paint him too, and said to me continually, "What a head!"


  
                        From my Diary.       "Sargent's picture is almost finished, and it is really splendid. Burne-Jones yesterday suggested two or three alterations about the color which Sargent immediately adopted, but Burne-Jones raves about the picture.

                  
"It ('Macbeth') is a most tremendous success, and the last three days' advance booking has been greater than ever was known, even at the Lyceum. Yes, it is a success, and I am a success, which amazes me, for never did I think I should be let down so easily. Some people hate me in it; some, Henry among them, think it my best part, and the critics differ, and discuss it hotly, which in itself is my best success of all! Those who don't like me in it are those who don't want, and don't like to read it fresh from Shakespeare, and who hold by the 'fiend' reading of the character.... One of the best things ever written on the subject, I think, is the essay of
J. Comyns Carr. That is as hotly discussed as the new 'Lady Mac'       all the best people agreeing with it. Oh, dear! It is an exciting time!"

  


    From a letter I wrote to my daughter, who was in Germany at the time:


  
                   "I wish you could see my dresses. They are superb, especially the first one: green beetles on it, and such a cloak! The photographs give no idea of it at all, for it is in color that it is so splendid. The dark red hair is fine. The whole thing is Rossetti       rich stained-glass effects, I play some of it well, but, of course, I don't do what I want to do yet. Meanwhile I shall not budge an inch in the reading of it, for that I know is right. Oh, it's fun, but it's precious hard work for I by no means make her a 'gentle, lovable woman' as some of 'em say. That's all pickles. She was nothing of the sort, although she was not a fiend, and did love her husband. I have to what is vulgarly called 'sweat at it,' each night."

  


    The few people who liked my Lady Macbeth, liked it very much. I hope I
    am not vain to quote this letter from Lady Pollock:


  
                   "...
Burne-Jones has been with me this afternoon: he was at 'Macbeth' last night, and you filled his whole soul with your beauty and your poetry.... He says you were a great Scandinavian queen; that your presence, your voice, your movement made a marvelously poetic harmony; that your dress was grandly imagined and grandly worn       and that he cannot criticize       he can only remember."

  


    But Burne-Jones by this time had become one of our most ardent admirers,
    and was prejudiced in my favor because my acting appealed to his eye.
    Still, the drama is for the eye as well as for the ear and the mind.


    Very early I learned that one had best be ambitious merely to please
    oneself in one's work a little       quietly. I coupled with this the
    reflection that one "gets nothing for nothing, and damned little for
    sixpence!"


    Here I was in the very noonday of life, fresh from Lady Macbeth and
    still young enough to play Rosalind, suddenly called upon to play a
    rather uninteresting mother in "The Dead Heart." However, my son
    Teddy
    made his first appearance in it, and had such a big success that I soon
    forgot that for me the play was rather "small beer."


    It had been done before, of course, by Benjamin Webster and George Vining. Henry engaged Bancroft for the Abbé, a part of quite as much
    importance as his own. It was only a melodrama, but Henry could always
    invest a melodrama with life, beauty, interest, mystery, by his methods
    of production.


  
                   "I'm full of French Revolution," he wrote to me when he was preparing the play for rehearsal, "and could pass an examination. In our play, at the taking of the Bastile we must have a starving crowd       hungry, eager, cadaverous faces. If that can be well carried out, the effect will be very terrible, and the contrast to the other crowd (the red and fat crowd       the blood-gorged ones who look as if they'd been all drinking wine       red wine, as Dickens says) would be striking.... It's tiresome stuff to read, because it depends so much on situations. I have been touching the book up though, and improved it here and there, I think.

                  
"A letter this morning from the illustrious Blank offering me his prompt book to look at.... I think I shall borrow the treasure. Why not? Of course he will say that he has produced the play and all that sort of thing; but what does that matter, if one can only get one hint out of it?

                  
"The longer we live, the more we see that if we only do our own work thoroughly well, we can be independent of everything else or anything that may be said....

                  
"I see in Landry a great deal of Manette       that same vacant gaze into years gone by when he crouched in his dungeon nursing his wrongs....

                  
"I shall send you another book soon to put any of your alterations and additions in. I've added a lot of little things with a few lines for you       very good, I think, though I say it as shouldn't       I know you'll laugh! They are perhaps not startling original, but better than the original, anyhow! Here they are       last act!

                  
"'Ah, Robert, pity me. By the recollections of our youth, I implore you to save my boy!' (Now for 'em!)

                  
"'If my voice recalls a tone that ever fell sweetly upon your ear, have pity on me! If the past is not a blank, if you once loved, have pity on me!' (Bravo!)

                  
"Now I call that very good, and if the 'If and the 'pitys' don't bring down the house, well it's a pity! I pity the pittites!

                  
"... I've just been copying out my part in an account book       a little more handy to put in one's pocket. It's really very short, but difficult to act, though, and so is yours. I like this 'piling up' sort of acting, and I am sure you will, when you play the part. It's restful. 'The Bells' is that sort of thing."

  


    The crafty old Henry! All this was to put me in conceit with my part!

          

    
    

          

    SIR HENRY IRVING

    From a photograph in the possession of Miss Evelyn Smalley

    Photographed by Crook, Edinburgh

          

    Many people at this time put me in conceit with my son, including dear
    Burne-Jones with his splendid gift of impulsive enthusiasm.

                   "THE GRANGE,
                  
"WEST KENSINGTON, W.
                  
"Sunday.

                  
"Most Dear Lady,       

                  
"I thought all went wonderfully last night, and no sign could I see of hitch or difficulty; and as for your boy, he looked a lovely little gentleman       and in his cups was perfect, not overdoing by the least touch a part always perilously easy to overdo. I too had the impertinence to be a bit nervous for you about him, but not when he appeared       so altogether I was quite happy.

                  
"... Irving was very noble       I thought I had never seen his face so beautified before       no, that isn't the word, and to hunt for the right one would be so like judicious criticism that I won't. Exalted and splendid it was       and you were you       YOU       and so all was well. I rather wanted more shouting and distant roar in the Bastille Scene       since the walls fell, like Jericho, by noise. A good dreadful growl always going on would have helped, I thought       and that was the only point where I missed anything.

                  
"And I was very glad you got your boy back again and that Mr. Irving was ready to have his head cut off for you; so it had what I call a good ending, and I am in bright spirits to-day, and ever

                  
"Your real friend,

                  
"E.B.-J."

                  
"I would come and growl gladly."


    There were terrible strikes all over England when we were playing "The
    Dead Heart." I could not help sympathizing with the strikers ... yet
    reading all about the French Revolution as I did then, I can't
    understand how the French nation can be proud of it when one remembers
    how they butchered their own great men, the leaders of the
    movement       Camille Desmoulins, Danton, Robespierre and the others. My man
    is Camille Desmoulins. I just love him.


    Plays adapted from novels are generally unsatisfactory. A whole story
    cannot be conveyed in three hours, and every reader of the story looks
    for something not in the play. Wills took from "The Vicar of Wakefield"
    an episode and did it right well, but there was no episode in "The
    Bride of Lammermoor" for Merivale to take. He tried to traverse the
    whole ground, and failed. But he gave me some lovely things to do in
    Lucy Ashton. I had to lose my poor wits, as in Ophelia, in the last act,
    and with hardly a word to say I was able to make an effect. The love
    scene at the well I did nicely too.

          

    
    

          

          ELLEN TERRY AS LUCY ASHTON IN       RAVENSWOOD      

          

    Seymour Lucas designed splendid dresses for this play. My "Ravenswood"
    riding dress set a fashion in ladies' coats for quite a long time. Mine
    was copied by Mr. Lucas from a leather coat of Lord Mohun's. He is said
    to have had it on when he was killed. At any rate there was a large stab
    in the back of the coat, and a blood-stain.


    This was my first speculation in play-buying! I saw it acted, and
    thought I could do something with it. Henry would not buy it, so I did!
    He let me do it first in front of a revival of "The Corsican Brothers"
    in 1891. It was a great success, although my son and I did not know a
    word on the first night and had our parts written out and pinned all
    over the furniture on the stage! Dear old Mr. Howe wrote to me that
    Teddy's performance was "more than creditable; it was exceedingly good
    and full of character, and with your own charming performance the piece
    was a great success." Since 1891 I must have played "Nance Oldfield"
    hundreds of times, but I never had an Alexander Oldworthy so good as my
    own son, although such talented young actors as Martin Harvey,
    Laurence
    Irving and, more recently, Harcourt Williams have all played it with me.


    Henry's pride as Cardinal Wolsey seemed to eat him. How wonderful he
    looked (though not fat and self-indulgent like the pictures of the real
    Wolsey) in his flame-colored robes! He had the silk dyed specially by
    the dyers to the Cardinal's College in Rome. Seymour Lucas designed the
    clothes. It was a magnificent production, but not very interesting to
    me. I played Katherine much better ten years later at Stratford-on-Avon
    at the Shakespeare Memorial Festival. I was stronger then, and more
    reposeful. This letter from Burne-Jones about "Henry VIII." is a
    delightful tribute to Henry Irving's treatment of the play:

                   "My Dear Lady,       

                  
"We went last night to the play (at my theater) to see Henry VIII.       Margaret and
Mackail and I. It was delicious to go out again and see mankind, after such evil days. How kind they were to me no words can say       I went in at a private door and then into a cosy box and back the same way, swiftly, and am marvelously the better for the adventure. No YOU, alas!

                  
"I have written to Mr. Irving just to thank him for his great kindness in making the path of pleasure so easy, for I go tremblingly at present. But I could not say to him what I thought of the Cardinal       a sort of shame keeps one from saying to an artist what one thinks of his work       but to you I can say how nobly he warmed up the story of the old religion to my exacting mind in that impersonation. I shall think always of dying monarchy in his Charles       and always of dying hierarchy in his Wolsey. How Protestant and dull all grew when that noble type had gone!

                  
"I can't go to church till red cardinals come back (and may they be of exactly that red) nor to Court till trumpets and banners come back       nor to evening parties till the dances are like that dance. What a lovely young Queen has been found. But there was no YOU.... Perhaps it was as well. I couldn't have you slighted even in a play, and put aside. When I go back to see you, as I soon will, it will be easier. Mr. Irving let me know you would not act, and proposed that I should go later on       wasn't that like him? So I sat with my children and was right happy; and, as usual, the streets looked dirty, and all the people muddy and black as we came away. Please not to answer this stuff.
      
                   "Ever yours affectionately,

                  
"E.B.-J.

                  
"       I wish that Cardinal could have been made Pope, and sat with his foot on the Earl of Surrey's neck. Also I wish to be a Cardinal; but then I sometimes want to be a pirate. We can't have all we want.

                  
"Your boy was very kind       I thought the race of young men who are polite and attentive to old fading ones had passed away with antique pageants       but it isn't so."

  
      
      



  


          

    HENRY IRVING AS CARDINAL WOLSEY IN       HENRY VIII      

    From the collection of Miss Evelyn Smalley

          

    When the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire gave the famous fancy dress
    ball at Devonshire House, Henry attended it in the robes which had
    appealed so strongly to Burne-Jones's imaginative eye. I was told by one
    who was present at this ball that as the Cardinal swept up the
    staircase, his long train held magnificently over his arm, a sudden wave
    of reality seemed to sweep upstairs with him, and reduce to the
    prettiest make-believe all the aristocratic masquerade that surrounded
    him.


    I renewed my acquaintance with "Henry VIII." in 1902, when I played
    Queen Katherine for Mr. Benson during the Shakespeare Memorial
    performances in April. I was pretty miserable at the time       the Lyceum
    reign was dying, and taking an unconscionably long time about it, which
    made the position all the more difficult. Henry Irving was reviving
    "Faust"       a wise step, as it had been his biggest "money-maker"       and it
    was impossible that I could play Margaret. There are some young parts
    that the actress can still play when she is no longer young: Beatrice,
    Portia, and many others come to mind. But I think that when the
    character is that of a young girl the betrayal of whose innocence is the
    main theme of the play, no amount of skill on the part of the actress
    can make up for the loss of youth.


    Suggestions were thrown out to me (not by Henry Irving, but by others
    concerned) that although I was too old for Margaret, I might play
    Martha! Well! well! I didn't quite see that. So I redeemed a promise
    given in jest at the Lyceum to Frank Benson twenty years earlier, and
    went off to Stratford-upon-Avon to play in Henry VIII.


    Mr. Benson was wonderful to work with. "I am proud to think," he wrote
    me just before our few rehearsals began, "that I have trained my folk
    (as I was taught by my elders and betters at the Lyceum) to be pretty
    quick at adapting themselves to anything that may be required of them,
    so that you need not be uneasy as to their not fitting in with your
    business."


    "My folk," as Mr. Benson called them, were excellent, especially Surrey
    (Harcourt Williams), Norfolk (Matheson Lang), Caperius (Fitzgerald), and
    Griffith (Nicholson). "Harcourt Williams," I wrote in my diary on the
    day of the dress-rehearsal, "will be heard of very shortly. He played
    Edgar in 'Lear' much better than Terriss, although not so good an actor
    yet."


    I played Katherine on Shakespeare's Birthday       such a lovely day, bright
    and sunny and warm. The performance went finely       and I made a little
    speech afterwards which was quite a success. I was presented publicly on
    the stage with the Certificate of Governorship of the Memorial Theater.


    During these pleasant days at Stratford, I went about in between the
    performances of "Henry VIII."       which was, I think, given three times a
    week for three weeks       seeing the lovely country and lovely friends who
    live there. A visit to Broadway and to beautiful Madame de Navarro (Mary
    Anderson) was particularly delightful. To see her looking so handsome,
    robust and fresh       so happy in her beautiful home, gave me the keenest
    pleasure. I also went to Stanways       the Elchos' home       a fascinating
    place. Lady Elcho showed me all over it, and she was not the least
    lovely thing in it.


    In Stratford I was rebuked by the permanent inhabitants for being kind
    to a little boy in professionally ragged clothing who made me, as he has
    made hundreds of others, listen to a long, made-up history of
    Stratford-on-Avon, Shakespeare, the Merchant of Venice, Julius Caesar
    and other things       the most hopeless mix! The inhabitants assured me that
    the boy was a little rascal, who begged and extorted money from visitors
    by worrying them with his recitation until they paid him to leave them
    alone.


    Long before I knew that the child was such a reprobate I had given him a
    pass to the gallery and a Temple Shakespeare! I derived such pleasure
    from his version of the "Mercy" speech from "The Merchant of Venice"
    that I still think he was ill-paid!


  
    
      
        
          
            
"The quality of mercy is not strange
It droppeth as the gentle rain from 'Eaven
Upon the place beneath; it is twicet bless.
It blesseth in that gives and in that takes
It is in the mightiest       in the mightiest
It becomes the throned monuk better than its crownd.

It's an appribute to God inself
It is in the thorny 'earts of kings
But not in the fit and dread of kings."

            
          
        
      
    
  


    I asked the boy what he meant to be when he was a man. He answered with
    decision: "A reciterer."


    I also asked him what he liked best in the play ("Henry VIII.").


    "When the blind went up and down and you smiled," he replied       surely a
    naïve compliment to my way of "taking a call"! Further pressed, he
    volunteered: "When you lay on the bed and died to please the angels."


          

    XIV
    LAST DAYS AT THE LYCEUM


    I had exactly ten years more with Henry Irving after "Henry VIII."
    During that time we did "King Lear," "Becket," "King Arthur,"
    "Cymbeline," "Madame Sans-Gêne," "Peter the Great" and "The Medicine
    Man." I feel too near to these productions to write about them. The
    first night of "Cymbeline" I felt almost dead. Nothing seemed right.
    "Everything is so slow, so slow," I wrote in my diary. "I don't feel a
    bit inspired, only dull and hide-bound." Yet Imogen was, I think, the
    only inspired performance of these later years. On the first night of
    "Sans-Gêne" I acted courageously and fairly well. Every one seemed to
    be delighted. The old Duke of Cambridge patted, or rather thumped, me
    on the shoulder and said kindly: "Ah, my dear, you can act!" Henry
    quite effaced me in his wonderful sketch of Napoleon. "It seems to me
    some nights," I wrote in my diary at the time, "as if I were watching
    Napoleon trying to imitate H.I., and I find myself immensely interested
    and amused in the watchings."


    "The Medicine Man" was, in my opinion, our only quite unworthy
    production.


  
                        From my Diary.       "Poor Taber has such an awful part in the play, and mine is even worse. It is short enough, yet I feel I can't cut too much of it.... The gem of the whole play is my hair! Not waved at all, and very filmy and pale. Henry, I admit, is splendid; but oh, it is all such rubbish!... If 'Manfred' and a few such plays are to succeed this, I simply must do something else."

  


    But I did not! I stayed on, as every one knows, when the Lyceum as a
    personal enterprise of Henry's was no more       when the farcical Lyceum
    Syndicate took over the theater. I played a wretched part in
    "Robespierre," and refused £12,000 to go to America with Henry in
    "Dante."


    In these days Henry was a changed man. He became more republican and
    less despotic as a producer. He left things to other people. As an actor
    he worked as faithfully as ever. Henley's stoical lines might have been
    written of him as he was in these last days:


  
    
      
        
          
            
              
"Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods there be
For my unconquerable soul.

"In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud:
Beneath the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody but unbowed."

              
            
          
        
      
    
  


    Henry Irving did not treat me badly. I hope I did not treat him badly.
    He revived "Faust" and produced "Dante." I would have liked to stay with
    him to the end of the chapter, but there was nothing for me to act in
    either of these plays. But we never quarreled. Our long partnership
    dissolved naturally. It was all very sad, but it could not be helped.


    It has always been a reproach against Henry Irving in some mouths that
    he neglected the modern English playwright; and of course the reproach
    included me to a certain extent. I was glad, then, to show that I
    could act in the new plays when Mr. Barrie wrote
    "Alice-sit-by-the-Fire" for me, and after some years' delay I was able
    to play in Mr. Bernard Shaw's "Captain Brassbound's Conversion." Of
    course I could not have played in "little" plays of this school at the
    Lyceum with Henry Irving, even if I had wanted to! They are essentially
    plays for small theaters.


    In Mr. Shaw's "A Man of Destiny" there were two good parts, and Henry,
    at my request, considered it, although it was always difficult to fit a
    one-act play into the Lyceum bill. For reasons of his own Henry never
    produced Mr. Shaw's play and there was a good deal of fuss made about it
    at the time (1897). But ten years ago Mr. Shaw was not so well known as
    he is now, and the so-called "rejection" was probably of use to him as
    an advertisement!


    "A Man of Destiny" has been produced since, but without any great
    success. I wonder if Henry and I could have done more with it?


    At this time Mr. Shaw and I frequently corresponded. It began by my
    writing to ask him, as musical critic of the Saturday Review, to tell
    me frankly what he thought of the chances of a composer-singer friend of
    mine. He answered "characteristically," and we developed a perfect fury
    for writing to each other! Sometimes the letters were on business,
    sometimes they were not, but always his were entertaining, and mine
    were, I suppose, "good copy," as he drew the character of Lady Cecily
    Waynflete in "Brassbound" entirely from my letters. He never met me
    until after the play was written. In 1902 he sent me this ultimatum:

                   "April 3, 1902.

                  
"Mr. Bernard Shaw's compliments to Miss Ellen Terry.

                  
"Mr. Bernard Shaw has been approached by Mrs. Langtry with a view to the immediate and splendid production of 'Captain Brassbound's Conversion.'

                  
"Mr. Bernard Shaw, with the last flash of a trampled-out love, has repulsed Mrs. Langtry with a petulance bordering on brutality.

                  
"Mr. Bernard Shaw has been actuated in this ungentlemanly and unbusinesslike course by an angry desire to seize Miss Ellen Terry by the hair and make her play Lady Cicely.

                  
"Mr. Bernard Shaw would be glad to know whether Miss Ellen Terry wishes to play Martha at the Lyceum instead.

                  
"Mr. Bernard Shaw will go to the length of keeping a minor part open for Sir Henry Irving when 'Faust' fails, if Miss Ellen Terry desires it.

                  
"Mr. Bernard Shaw lives in daily fear of Mrs. Langtry's recovering sufficiently from her natural resentment of his ill manners to reopen the subject.

                  
"Mr. Bernard Shaw begs Miss Ellen Terry to answer this letter.

                  
"Mr. Bernard Shaw is looking for a new cottage or house in the country, and wants advice on the subject.

                  
"Mr. Bernard Shaw craves for the sight of Miss Ellen Terry's once familiar handwriting."


    The first time he came to my house I was not present, but a young
    American lady who had long adored him from the other side of the
    Atlantic took my place as hostess (I was at the theater as usual); and I
    took great pains to have everything looking nice! I spent a long time
    putting out my best blue china, and ordered a splendid dinner, quite
    forgetting the honored guest generally dined off a Plasmon biscuit and a
    bean!


    Mr. Shaw read "Arms and the Man" to my young American friend (Miss
    Satty
    Fairchild) without even going into the dining-room where the blue china
    was spread out to delight his eye. My daughter Edy was present at the
    reading, and appeared so much absorbed in some embroidery, and paid the
    reader so few compliments about his play, that he expressed the opinion
    that she behaved as if she had been married to him for twenty years!


    The first time I ever saw Mr. Shaw in the flesh       I hope he will pardon
    me such an anti-vegetarian expression       was when he took his call after
    the first production of "Captain Brassbound's Conversion" by the Stage
    Society. He was quite unlike what I had imagined from his letters.


    When at last I was able to play in "Captain Brassbound's Conversion," I
    found Bernard Shaw wonderfully patient at rehearsal. I look upon him as
    a good, kind, gentle creature whose "brain-storms" are just due to the
    Irishman's love of a fight; they never spring from malice or anger. It
    doesn't answer to take Bernard Shaw seriously. He is not a man of
    convictions. That is one of the charms of his plays       to me at least. One
    never knows how the cat is really jumping. But it jumps. Bernard Shaw
    is alive, with nine lives, like that cat!


    On Whit Monday, 1902, I received a telegram from Mr. Tree saying that he
    was coming down to Winchelsea to see me on "an important matter of
    business." I was at the time suffering from considerable depression
    about the future.


    The Stratford-on-Avon visit had inspired me with the feeling that there
    was life in the old 'un yet and had distracted my mind from the
    strangeness of no longer being at the Lyceum permanently with Henry
    Irving. But there seemed to be nothing ahead, except two matinées a
    week with him at the Lyceum, to be followed by a provincial tour in
    which I was only to play twice a week, as Henry's chief attraction was
    to be "Faust." This sort of "dowager" engagement did not tempt me.
    Besides, I hated the idea of drawing a large salary and doing next to no
    work.


    So when Mr. Tree proposed that I should play Mrs. Page (Mrs. Kendal
    being Mrs. Ford) in "The Merry Wives of Windsor" at His Majesty's, it
    was only natural that I should accept the offer joyfully. I telegraphed
    to Henry Irving, asking him if he had any objection to my playing at His
    Majesty's. He answered: "Quite willing if proposed arrangements about matinées are adhered to."


    I have thought it worth while to give the facts about this engagement,
    because so many people seemed at the time, and afterwards, to think that
    I had treated Henry Irving badly by going to play in another theater,
    and that theater one where a certain rivalry with the Lyceum as regards
    Shakespearean productions had grown up. There was absolutely no
    foundation for the rumors that my "desertion" caused further
    estrangement between Henry Irving and me.


    "Heaven give you many, many merry days and nights," he telegraphed to me
    on the first night; and after that first night (the jolliest that I ever
    saw), he wrote delighting in my success.


    It was a success       there was no doubt about it! Some people accused the
    Merry Wives of rollicking and "mafficking" overmuch       but these were the
    people who forgot that we were acting in a farce, and that farce is
    farce, even when Shakespeare is the author.


    All the summer I enjoyed myself thoroughly. It was all such good
    fun       Mrs. Kendal was so clever and delightful to play with, Mr. Tree so
    indefatigable in discovering new funny "business."


    After the dress-rehearsal I wrote in my diary: "Edy has real genius for
    dresses for the stage." My dress for Mrs. Page was such a real
    thing       it helped me enormously       and I was never more grateful for my
    daughter's gift than when I played Mrs. Page.


    It was an admirable all-round cast       almost a "star" cast:
    Oscar Asche as
    Ford, poor Henry Kemble (since dead) as Dr. Caius,
    Courtice Pounds as
    Sir Hugh Evans, and Mrs. Tree as sweet Anne Page all rowed in the boat
    with precisely the right swing. There were no "passengers" in the cast.
    The audience at first used to seem rather amazed! This thwacking
    rough-and-tumble, Rabelaisian horse-play       Shakespeare! Impossible! But
    as the evening went on we used to capture even the most civilized, and
    force them to return to a simple Elizabethan frame of mind.


    In my later career I think I have had no success like this! Letters
    rained on me       yes, even love-letters, as if, to quote Mrs. Page, I were
    still in "the holiday-time of my beauty." As I would always rather make
    an audience laugh than see them weep, it may be guessed how much I
    enjoyed the hearty laughter at His Majesty's during the run of the
    madcap absurdity of "The Merry Wives of Windsor."


    All the time I was at His Majesty's I continued to play in matinées of
    "Charles I." and "The Merchant of Venice" at the Lyceum with Henry
    Irving. We went on negotiating, too, about the possibility of my
    appearing in "Dante," which Sardou had written specially for Irving, and
    on which he was relying for his next tour in America.


    On the 19th of July, 1902, I acted at the Lyceum for the very last time,
    although I did not know it then. These last Lyceum days were very sad.
    The reception given by Henry to the Indian Princes, who were in England
    for the Coronation, was the last flash of the splendid hospitality which
    had for so many years been one of the glories of the theater.


    During my provincial tour with Henry Irving in the autumn of this year I
    thought long and anxiously over the proposition that I should play in
    "Dante." I heard the play read, and saw no possible part for me in it. I
    refused a large sum of money to go to America with Henry Irving because
    I could not consent to play a part even worse than the one that I had
    played in "Robespierre." As things turned out, although "Dante" did
    fairly well at Drury Lane, the Americans would have none of it and Henry
    had to fall back upon his répertoire.


    Having made the decision against "Dante," I began to wonder what I
    should do. My partnership with Henry Irving was definitely broken, most
    inevitably and naturally "dissolved." There were many roads open to me.
    I chose one which was, from a financial point of view, madness.


    Instead of going to America, and earning £12,000, I decided to take a
    theater with my son, and produce plays in conjunction with him.


    I had several plays in view       an English translation of a French play
    about the patient Griselda, and a comedy by Miss Clo Graves among them.
    Finally, I settled upon Ibsen's "Vikings."


    We read it aloud on Christmas Day, and it seemed tremendous. Not in my
    most wildly optimistic moments did I think Hiordis, the chief female
    character       a primitive, fighting, free, open-air person       suited to me,
    but I saw a way of playing her more brilliantly and less weightily
    than the text suggested, and anyhow I was not thinking so much of the
    play for me as for my son. He had just produced Mr. Laurence Houseman's
    Biblical play "Bethlehem" in the hall of the Imperial Institute, and
    every one had spoken highly of the beauty of his work. He had previously
    applied the same principles to the mounting of operas by Handel and
    Purcell.


    It had been a great grief to me when I lost my son as an actor. I have
    never known any one with so much natural gift for the stage.
    Unconsciously he did everything right       I mean all the technical things
    over which some of us have to labor for years. The first part that he
    played at the Lyceum, Arthur St. Valery in "The Dead Heart," was good,
    and he went on steadily improving. The last part that he played at the
    Lyceum       Edward IV. in "Richard III."       was, maternal prejudice quite
    apart, a most remarkable performance.


    His record for 1891, when he was still a mere boy, was: Claudio (in
    "Much Ado about Nothing"), Mercutio, Modus, Charles Surface, Alexander
    Oldworthy, Moses (in "Olivia"), Lorenzo, Malcolm, Beauchamp; Meynard,
    and the Second Grave-Digger!


    Later on he played Hamlet, Macbeth and Romeo on a small provincial
    tour. His future as an actor seemed assured, but it wasn't! One day when
    he was with William Nicholson, the clever artist and one of the Beggarstaff Brothers of poster fame, he began chipping at a woodblock in
    imitation of Nicholson, and produced in a few hours an admirable
    wood-cut of Walt Whitman, then and always his particular hero. From that
    moment he had the "black and white" fever badly. Acting for a time
    seemed hardly to interest him at all. When his interest in the theater
    revived, it was not as an actor but as a stage director that he wanted
    to work.


    What more natural than that his mother should give him the chance of
    exploiting his ideas in London? Ideas he had in plenty       "unpractical"
    ideas people called them; but what else should ideas be?


    At the Imperial Theater, where I spent my financially unfortunate season
    in April 1903, I gave my son a free hand. I hope it will be remembered,
    when I am spoken of by the youngest critics after my death as a
    "Victorian" actress, lacking in enterprise, an actress belonging to the
    "old school," that I produced a spectacular play of Ibsen's in a manner
    which possibly anticipated the scenic ideas of the future by a century,
    of which at any rate the orthodox theater managers of the present age
    would not have dreamed.


    Naturally I am not inclined to criticize my son's methods. I think there
    is a great deal to be said for the views that he has expressed in his
    pamphlet on "The Art of the Theater," and when I worked with him I found
    him far from unpractical. It was the modern theater which was
    unpractical when he was in it! It was wrongly designed, wrongly built.
    We had to disembowel the Imperial behind scenes before he could even
    start, and then the great height of the proscenium made his lighting
    lose all its value. He always considered the pictorial side of the scene
    before its dramatic significance, arguing that this significance lay in
    the picture and in movement       the drama having originated not with the
    poet but with the dancer.


    When his idea of dramatic significance clashed with Ibsen's, strange
    things would happen.


    Mr. Bernard Shaw, though impressed by my son's work and the beauty that
    he brought on to the stage of the Imperial, wrote to me that the
    symbolism of the first act according to Ibsen should be Dawn, youth
    rising with the morning sun, reconciliation, rich gifts, brightness,
    lightness, pleasant feelings, peace. On to this sunlit scene stalks Hiordis, a figure of gloom, revenge, of feud eternal, of relentless
    hatred and uncompromising unforgetfulness of wrong. At the Imperial,
    said Mr. Shaw, the curtain rose on profound gloom. When you could see
    anything you saw eld and severity       old men with white hair impersonating
    the gallant young sons of Ornulf       everywhere murky cliffs and shadowy
    spears, melancholy       darkness!


    Into this symbolic night enter, in a blaze of limelight, a fair figure
    robed in complete fluffy white fur, a gay and bright Hiordis with a
    timid manner and hesitating utterance.


    The last items in the topsy-turviness of my son's practical significance
    were entirely my fault! Mr. Shaw was again moved to compliments when I
    revived "Much Ado about Nothing" under my son's direction at the
    Imperial. "The dance was delightful, but I would suggest the
    substitution of trained dancers for untrained athletes," he wrote.


    I singed my wings a good deal in the Imperial limelight, which, although
    our audience complained of the darkness on the stage, was the most
    serious drain on my purse. But a few provincial tours did something
    towards restoring some of the money that I had lost in management.


    On one of these tours I produced "The Good Hope," a play by the Dutch
    dramatist, Heijermans, dealing with life in a fishing village. Done into
    simple and vigorous English by Christopher St. John, the play proved a
    great success in the provinces. This was almost as new a departure for
    me as my season at the Imperial. The play was essentially modern in
    construction and development       full of action, but the action of incident
    rather than the action of stage situation. It had no "star" parts, but
    every part was good, and the gloom of the story was made bearable by the
    beauty of the atmosphere       of the sea, which played a bigger part in it
    than any of the visible characters.


    For the first time I played an old woman, a very homely old peasant
    woman too. It was not a big part, but it was interesting, and in the
    last act I had a little scene in which I was able to make the same kind
    of effect that I had made years before in the last act of
    "Ravenswood"       an effect of quiet and stillness.

    I flattered myself that I was able to assume a certain roughness and
    solidity of the peasantry in "The Good Hope," but although I stumbled
    about heavily in large sabots, I was told by the critics that I walked
    like a fairy and was far too graceful for a Dutch fisherwoman! It is a
    case of "Give a dog a bad name and hang him"       the bad name in my case
    being "a womanly woman"! What this means I scarcely apprehend, but I
    fancy it is intended to signify (in an actress) something sweet, pretty,
    soft, appealing, gentle and underdone. Is it possible that I convey
    that impression when I try to assume the character of a washerwoman or a
    fisherwoman? If so I am a very bad actress!


    My last Shakespearean part was Hermione in "A Winter's Tale." By some
    strange coincidence it fell to me to play it exactly fifty years after I
    had played the little boy Mamilius in the same play. I sometimes think
    that Fate is the best of stage managers! Hermione is a gravely beautiful
    part       well-balanced, difficult to act, but certain in its appeal. If
    only it were possible to put on the play in a simple way and arrange the
    scenes to knit up the raveled interest, I should hope to play Hermione
    again.

    MY STAGE JUBILEE


    When I had celebrated my stage jubilee in 1906, I suddenly began to feel
    exuberantly young again. It was very inappropriate, but I could not help
    it.


    The recognition of my fifty years of stage life by the public and by my
    profession was quite unexpected. Henry Irving had said to me not long
    before his death in 1905 that he believed that they (the theatrical
    profession) "intended to celebrate our jubilee." (If he had lived he
    would have completed his fifty years on the stage in the autumn of
    1906.) He said that there would be a monster performance at Drury Lane,
    and that already the profession were discussing what form it was to
    take.


    After his death, I thought no more of the matter. Indeed I did not want
    to think about it, for any recognition of my jubilee which did not
    include his, seemed to me very unnecessary.


    Of course I was pleased that others thought it necessary. I enjoyed all
    the celebrations. Even the speeches that I had to make did not spoil my
    enjoyment. But all the time I knew perfectly well that the great show of
    honor and "friending" was not for me alone. Never for one instant did I
    forget this, nor that the light of the great man by whose side I had
    worked for a quarter of a century was still shining on me from his
    grave.


    The difficulty was to thank people as they deserved. Stammering speeches
    could not do it, but I hope that they all understood. "I were but little
    happy, if I could say how much."


    Kindness on kindness's head accumulated! There was The Tribune
    testimonial. I can never forget that London's youngest newspaper first
    conceived the idea of celebrating my Stage Jubilee.13


    The matinée given in my honor at Drury Lane by the theatrical profession
    was a wonderful sight. The two things about it which touched me most
    deeply were my reception by the crowd who were waiting to get into the
    gallery when I visited them at two in the morning, and the presence of
    Eleonora Duse, who came all the way from Florence just to honor me. She
    told me afterwards that she would have come from South Africa or from
    Heaven, had she been there! I appreciated very much too, the kindness of
    Signor Caruso in singing for me. I did not know him at all, and the gift
    of his service was essentially the impersonal desire of an artist to
    honor another artist.


    I was often asked during these jubilee days, "how I felt about it all,"
    and I never could answer sensibly. The strange thing is that I don't
    know even now what was in my heart. Perhaps it was one of my chief joys
    that I had not to say good-bye at any of the celebrations. I could still
    speak to my profession as a fellow-comrade on the active list, and to
    the public as one still in their service.


    One of those little things almost too good to be true happened at the
    close of the Drury Lane matinée. A four-wheeler was hailed for me by the
    stage-door keeper, and my daughter and I drove off to
    Lady Bancroft's in
    Berkeley Square to leave some flowers. Outside the house, the cabman
    told my daughter that in old days he had often driven Charles Kean from
    the Princess's Theater, and that sometimes the little Miss Terrys were
    put inside the cab too and given a lift! My daughter thought it such an
    extraordinary coincidence that the old man should have come to the
    stage-door of Drury Lane by a mere chance on my jubilee day that she
    took his address, and I was to send him a photograph and remuneration.
    But I promptly lost the address, and was never able to trace the old
    man.

          

    APOLOGIA


    I have now nearly finished the history of my fifty years upon the stage.


    A good deal has been left out through want of skill in selection. Some
    things have been included which perhaps it would have been wiser to
    omit.


    I have tried my best to tell "all things faithfully," and it is possible
    that I have given offense where offense was not dreamed of; that some
    people will think that I should not have said this, while others,
    approving of "this," will be quite certain that I ought not to have said
    "that."

"One said it thundered ... another that an angel spake."


    It's the point of view, for I have "set down naught in malice."


    During my struggles with my refractory, fragmentary, and unsatisfactory
    memories, I have realized that life itself is a point of view: is, to
    put it more clearly, imagination.


    So if any one said to me at this point in my story: "And is this, then,
    what you call your life?" I should not resent the question one little
    bit.


    "We have heard," continues my imaginary and disappointed interlocutor,
    "a great deal about your life in the theater. You have told us of plays
    and parts and rehearsals, of actors good and bad, of critics and of
    playwrights, of success and failure, but after all, your whole life has
    not been lived in the theater. Have you nothing to tell us about your
    different homes, your family life, your social diversions, your friends
    and acquaintances? During your life there have been great changes in
    manners and customs; political parties have altered; a great Queen has
    died; your country has been engaged in two or three serious wars. Did
    all these things make no impression on you? Can you tell us nothing of
    your life in the world?"


    And I have to answer that I have lived very little in the world. After
    all, the life of an actress belongs to the theater as the life of a
    soldier belongs to the army, the life of a politician to the State, and
    the life of a woman of fashion to society.


    Certainly I have had many friends outside the theater, but I have had
    very little time to see them.


    I have had many homes, but I have had very little time to live in them!


    When I am not acting, the best part of my time is taken up by the most
    humdrum occupations. Dealing with my correspondence, even with the help
    of a secretary, is no insignificant work. The letters, chiefly
    consisting of requests for my autograph, or appeals to my charity, have
    to be answered. I have often been advised to ignore them       surely a
    course that would be both bad policy and bad taste on the part of a
    servant of the public. It would be unkind, too, to those ignorant of my
    busy life and the calls upon my time.


    Still, I sometimes wish that the cost of a postage stamp were a
    sovereign at least!



    In 1887, the year of Queen Victoria's Jubilee, I find that I wrote in my
    diary:       "I am not yet forty, but am pretty well worn out."


    It is twenty years since then, and I am still not worn out. Wonderful!

          

    THE DEATH OF HENRY IRVING


    It is commonly known, I think, that Henry Irving's health first began to
    fail in 1896.


    He went home to Grafton Street after the first night of the revival of
    "Richard III." and slipped on the stairs, injuring his knee. With
    characteristic fortitude, he struggled to his feet unassisted and walked
    to his room. This made the consequences of the accident far more
    serious, and he was not able to act for weeks.


    It was a bad year at the Lyceum.


    In 1898 when we were on tour he caught a chill. Inflammation of the
    lungs, bronchitis, pneumonia followed. His heart was affected. He was
    never really well again.


    When I think of his work during the next seven years, I could weep!
    Never was there a more admirable, extraordinary worker; never was any
    one more splendid-couraged and patient.


    The seriousness of his illness in 1898 was never really known. He nearly
    died.


  
                   "I am still fearfully anxious about H.," I wrote to my daughter at the time. "It will be a long time at the best before he gains strength.... But now I do hope for the best. I'm fairly well so far. All he wants is for me to keep my health, not my head. He knows I'm doing that! Last night I did three acts of 'Sans-Gêne' and 'Nance Oldfield' thrown in! That is a bit too much       awful work       and I can't risk it again."

                  
"A telegram just come: 'Steadily improving....' You should have seen Norman14 as Shylock! It was not a bare 'get-through.' It was       the first night       an admirable performance, as well as a plucky one.... H. is more seriously ill than anyone dreams.... His look! Like the last act of Louis XI."

  


    In 1902, on the last provincial tour that we ever went together, he was
    ill again, but he did not give in. One night when his cough was rending
    him, and he could hardly stand up from weakness, he acted so brilliantly
    and strongly that it was easy to believe in the triumph of mind over
    matter       in Christian Science, in fact!


    Strange to say, a newspaper man noticed the splendid power of his
    performance that night and wrote of it with uncommon discernment       a
    provincial critic, by the way.


    In London at the time they were always urging Henry Irving to produce
    new plays by new playwrights. But in the face of the failure of most of
    the new work, and of his departing strength, and of the extraordinary
    support given him in the old plays (during this 1902 tour we took £4,000
    at Glasgow in one week!), Henry took the wiser course in doing nothing
    but the old plays to the end of the chapter.


    I realized how near, not only the end of the chapter but the end of the
    book was, when he was taken ill at Wolverhampton in the spring of 1905.


    We had not acted together for more than two years then, and times were
    changed indeed.


    I went down to Wolverhampton when the news of his illness reached
    London. I arrived late and went to an hotel. It was not a good hotel,
    nor could I find a very good florist when I got up early the next day
    and went out with the intention of buying Henry some flowers. I wanted
    some bright-colored ones for him       he had always liked bright
    flowers       and this florist dealt chiefly in white flowers       funeral
    flowers.


    At last I found some daffodils       my favorite flower. I bought a bunch,
    and the kind florist, whose heart was in the right place if his flowers
    were not, found me a nice simple glass to put it in. I knew the sort of
    vase that I should find at Henry's hotel.


    I remembered, on my way to the doctor's       for I had decided to see the
    doctor first       that in 1892 when my dear mother died, and I did not act
    for a few nights, when I came back I found my room at the Lyceum filled
    with daffodils. "To make it look like sunshine," Henry said.


    The doctor talked to me quite frankly.


    "His heart is dangerously weak," he said.


    "Have you told him?" I asked.


    "I had to, because the heart being in that condition he must be
    careful."


    "Did he understand really?"


    "Oh, yes. He said he quite understood."


    Yet a few minutes later when I saw Henry, and begged him to remember
    what the doctor had said about his heart, he exclaimed: "Fiddle! It's
    not my heart at all! It's my breath!" (Oh the ignorance of great men
    about themselves!)


    "I also told him," the Wolverhampton doctor went on, "that he must not
    work so hard in future."


    I said: "He will, though,       and he's stronger than any one."


    Then I went round to the hotel.


    I found him sitting up in bed, drinking his coffee.


    He looked like some beautiful gray tree that I have seen in Savannah.
    His old dressing-gown hung about his frail yet majestic figure like some
    mysterious gray drapery.


    We were both very much moved, and said little.


    "I'm glad you've come. Two Queens have been kind to me this morning.
    Queen Alexandra telegraphed to say how sorry she was I was ill, and now
    you       "


    He showed me the Queen's gracious message.


    I told him he looked thin and ill, but rested.


    "Rested! I should think so. I have plenty of time to rest. They tell me
    I shall be here eight weeks. Of course I sha'n't, but still       It was that
    rug in front of the door. I tripped over it. A commercial traveler
    picked me up       a kind fellow, but d       n him, he wouldn't leave me
    afterwards       wanted to talk to me all night."


    I remembered his having said this, when I was told by his servant,
    Walter Collinson, that on the night of his death at Bradford, he
    stumbled over the rug when he walked into the hotel corridor.


    We fell to talking about work. He said he hoped that I had a good
    manager ... agreed very heartily with me about Frohman, saying he was
    always so fair       more than fair.


    "What a wonderful life you've had, haven't you?" I exclaimed, thinking
    of it all in a flash.


    "Oh, yes," he said quietly ... "a wonderful life       of work."


    "And there's nothing better, after all, is there?"


    "Nothing."


    "What have you got out of it all.... You and I are 'getting on,' as
    they say. Do you ever think, as I do sometimes, what you have got out of
    life?"


    "What have I got out of it?" said Henry, stroking his chin and smiling
    slightly. "Let me see.... Well, a good cigar, a good glass of wine       good
    friends." Here he kissed my hand with courtesy. Always he was so
    courteous; always his actions, like this little one of kissing my hand,
    were so beautifully timed. They came just before the spoken words, and
    gave them peculiar value.


    "That's not a bad summing-up of it all," I said. "And the end.... How
    would you like that to come?"


    "How would I like that to come?" He repeated my question lightly yet
    meditatively too. Then he was silent for some thirty seconds before he
    snapped his fingers       the action again before the words.


    "Like that!"


    I thought of the definition of inspiration       "A calculation rapidly
    made." Perhaps he had never thought of the manner of his death before.
    Now he had an inspiration as to how it would come.


    We were silent a long time, I thinking how like some splendid Doge of
    Venice he looked, sitting up in bed, his beautiful mobile hand stroking
    his chin.


    I agreed, when I could speak, that to be snuffed out like a candle would
    save a lot of trouble.


    After Henry Irving's sudden death in October of the same year, some of
    his friends protested against the statement that it was the kind of
    death that he desired       that they knew, on the contrary, that he thought
    sudden death inexpressibly sad.


    I can only say what he told me.


    I stayed with him about three hours at Wolverhampton. Before I left I
    went back to see the doctor again       a very nice man by the way, and
    clever.


    He told me that Henry ought never to play "The Bells" again, even if he
    acted again, which he said ought not to be.


    It was clever of the doctor to see what a terrible emotional strain "The
    Bells" put upon Henry       how he never could play the part of Matthias with
    ease as he could Louis XI., for example.


    Every time he heard the sound of the bells, the throbbing of his heart
    must have nearly killed him. He used always to turn quite white       there
    was no trick about it. It was imagination acting physically on the body.


    His death as Matthias       the death of a strong, robust man       was different
    from all his other stage deaths. He did really almost die       he imagined
    death with such horrible intensity. His eyes would disappear upwards,
    his face grow gray, his limbs cold.

    No wonder, then, that the first time that the Wolverhampton doctor's
    warning was disregarded, and Henry played "The Bells" at Bradford, his
    heart could not stand the strain. Within twenty-four hours of his last
    death as Matthias, he was dead.


    What a heroic thing was that last performance of Becket which came
    between! I am told by those who were in the company at the time that he
    was obviously suffering and dazed, this last night of life. But he went
    through it all as usual. The courteous little speech to the audience,
    the signing of a worrying boy's drawing at the stage-door       all that he
    had done for years, he did faithfully for the last time.

          

    
    

          

    HENRY IRVING AS BECKET

    Photographed by H.H. Hay Cameron

          

    Yes, I know it seems sad to the ordinary mind that he should have died
    in the entrance to an hotel in a country-town with no friend, no
    relation near him. Only his faithful and devoted servant Walter
    Collinson (whom, as was not his usual custom, he had asked to drive back
    to the hotel with him that night) was there. Do I not feel the tragedy
    of the beautiful body, for so many years the house of a thousand souls,
    being laid out in death by hands faithful and devoted enough, but not
    the hands of his kindred either in blood or in sympathy!


    I do feel it, yet I know it was more appropriate to such a man than the
    deathbed where friends and relations weep.


    Henry Irving belonged to England, not to a family. England showed that
    she knew it when she buried him in Westminster Abbey.


    Years before I had discussed, half in joke, the possibility of this
    honor. I remember his saying to me with great simplicity, when I asked
    him what he expected of the public after his death: "I should like them
    to do their duty by me. And they will       they will!"


    There was not a touch of arrogance in this, just as I hope there was no
    touch of heartlessness in me because my chief thought during the funeral
    in Westminster Abbey was: "How Henry would have liked it!" The right
    note was struck, as I think was not the case at Tennyson's funeral
    thirteen years earlier.


  
                   "Tennyson is buried to-day in Westminster Abbey," I wrote in my diary, October 12, 1892. "His majestic life and death spoke of him better than the service.... The music was poor and dull and weak, while he was strong. The triumphant should have been the sentiment expressed.... Faces one knew everywhere. Lord Salisbury looked fine. His massive head and sad eyes were remarkable. No face there, however, looked anything by the side of Henry's.... He looked very pale and slim and wonderful!"

  


    How terribly I missed that face at Henry's own funeral! I kept on
    expecting to see it, for indeed it seemed to me that he was directing
    the whole most moving and impressive ceremony. I could almost hear him
    saying, "Get on! get on!" in the parts of the service that dragged. When
    the sun       such a splendid, tawny sun       burst across the solemn misty gray
    of the Abbey, at the very moment when the coffin, under its superb pall
    of laurel leaves,15 was carried up the choir, I felt that it was an
    effect which he would have loved.


    I can understand any one who was present at Henry Irving's funeral
    thinking that this was his best memorial, and that any attempt to honor
    him afterwards would be superfluous and inadequate.


    Yet when some further memorial was discussed, it was not always easy to
    sympathize with those who said: "We got him buried in Westminster Abbey.
    What more do you want?"


    After all it was Henry Irving's commanding genius, and his devotion of
    it to high objects, his personal influence on the English people, which
    secured him burial among England's great dead. The petition for the
    burial presented to the Dean and Chapter, and signed, on the initiative
    of Henry Irving's leading fellow-actors, by representative personages of
    influence, succeeded only because of Henry's unique position.


    "We worked very hard to get it done," I heard said       more than once. And
    I often longed to answer: "Yes, and all honor to your efforts, but you
    worked for it between Henry's death and his funeral. He worked for it
    all his life!"


    I have always desired some other memorial to Henry Irving than his
    honored grave, not so much for his sake as for the sake of those who
    loved him and would gladly welcome the opportunity of some great test of
    their devotion.


    Henry Irving's profession decided last year, after much belated
    discussion, to put up a statue to him in the streets of London. I
    believe that it is to take the form of a portrait statue in academic
    robes. A statue can never at any time be a very happy memorial to an
    actor, who does not do his work in his own person, but through his
    imagination of many different persons. If statue it had to be, the work
    should have had a symbolic character. My dear friend Alfred Gilbert, one
    of the most gifted sculptors of this or any age, expressed a similar
    opinion to the committee of the memorial, and later on wrote to me as
    follows:


  
                   "I should never have attempted the representation of Irving as a mummer, nor literally as Irving disguised as this one or that one, but as Irving       the artistic exponent of other great artists' conceptions       Irving, the greatest illustrator of the greatest men's creations       he himself being a creator.

                  
"I had no idea of making use of Irving's facial and physical peculiarities as a means to perpetuate his life's work. The spirit of this work was worship of an ideal, and it was no fault of his that his strong personality dominated the honest conviction of his critics. These judged Irving as the man masquerading, not as the Artist interpreting, for the single reason that they were themselves overcome by the magic personality of a man above their comprehension.

                  
"I am convinced that Irving, when playing the rôle of whatever character he undertook to represent, lived in that character, and not as the actor playing the part for the applause of those in front       Charles I. was a masterpiece of conception as to the representation of a great gentleman. His Cardinal Wolsey was the most perfect presentation of greatness, of self-abnegation, and of power to suffer I can realize.... Jingle and Matthias were in Comedy and Tragedy combined, masterpieces of histrionic art. I could write volumes upon Irving as an actor, but to write of him as a man, and as a very great Artist, I should require more time than is still allotted to me of man's brief span of life and far, far more power than that which was given to those who wrote of him in a hurry during his lifetime.... Do you wonder, then, that I should rather elect to regard Irving in the abstract, when called
upon to suggest a fitting monument, than to promise a faithful portrait?... Let us be grateful, however, that a great artist is to be commemorated at all, side by side with the effigies of great Butchers of mankind, and ephemeral statesmen, the instigators of useless bloodshed...."

  


          ALFRED GILBERT AND OTHERS


    Alfred Gilbert was one of Henry's sincere admirers in the old Lyceum
    days, and now if you want to hear any one talk of those days
    brilliantly, delightfully, and whimsically, if you want to live first
    nights and Beefsteak Room suppers over again       if you want to have Henry
    Irving at the Garrick Club recreated before your eyes, it is only Alfred
    Gilbert who can do it for you!


    He lives now in Bruges, that beautiful dead city of canals and Hans
    Memlings, and when I was there a few years ago I saw him. I shall never
    forget his welcome! I let him know of my arrival, and within a few hours
    he sent a carriage to my hotel to bring me to his house. The seats of
    the fiacre were hidden by flowers! He had not long been in his house,
    and there were packing-cases still lying about in the spacious, desolate
    rooms looking into an old walled garden. But on the wall of the room in
    which we dined was a sketch by Raffaele, and the dinner, chiefly cooked
    by Mr. Gilbert himself,       the Savoy at its best!


    Some people regret that he has "buried" himself in Bruges, and that
    England has practically lost her best sculptor. I think that he will do
    some of the finest work of his life there, and meanwhile England should
    be proud of Alfred Gilbert.


    In a city which can boast of some of the ugliest and weakest statues in
    the world, he has, in the fountain erected to the memory of the good
    Lord Shaftesbury in Piccadilly Circus, created a thing of beauty which
    will be a joy to future generations of Londoners.


    The other day Mr. Frampton, one of the leaders of the younger school of
    English sculptors, said of the Gilbert fountain that it could hold its
    own with the finest work of the same kind done by the masters of the
    past. "They tell me," he said, "that it is inappropriate to its
    surroundings. It is. That's the fault of the surroundings. In a more
    enlightened age than this, Piccadilly Circus will be destroyed and
    rebuilt merely as a setting for Gilbert's jewel."


    "The name of Gilbert is honored in this house," went on Mr. Frampton. We
    were at the time looking at Henry Irving's death-mask which Mr. Frampton
    had taken, and a replica of which he had just given me. I thought of
    Henry's living face, alive with raffish humor and mischief, presiding at
    a supper in the Beefsteak Room       and of Alfred Gilbert's Beethoven-like
    head with its splendid lion-like mane of tawny hair. Those days were
    dead indeed.


    Now it seems to me that I did not appreciate them half enough       that I
    did not observe enough. Yet players should observe, if only for their
    work's sake. The trouble is that only certain types of men and
    women       the expressive types which are useful to us       appeal to our
    observation.


    I remember one supper very well at which Bastien-Lepage was present, and
    "Miss Sarah" too. The artist was lost in admiration of Henry's face, and
    expressed a strong desire to paint him. The Bastien-Lepage portrait
    originated that evening, and is certainly a Beefsteak Room portrait,
    although Henry gave two sittings for it afterwards at Grafton Street. At
    the supper itself Bastien-Lepage drew on a half-sheet of paper for me
    two little sketches, one of Sarah Bernhardt and the other of Henry,
    which are among my most precious relics.


          

    
    

          

    SIR HENRY IRVING

    From the painting by Jules Bastien-Lepage

          

    My portrait as Lady Macbeth by Sargent used to hang in the alcove in the
    Beefsteak Room when it was not away at some exhibition, and the artist
    and I have often supped under it       to me no infliction, for I have
    always loved the picture, and think it is far more like me than any
    other. Mr. Sargent first of all thought that he would paint me at the
    moment when Lady Macbeth comes out of the castle to welcome Duncan. He
    liked the swirl of the dress, and the torches and the women bowing down
    on either side. He used to make me walk up and down his studio until I
    nearly dropped in my heavy dress, saying suddenly as I got the
    swirl:       "That's it, that's it!" and rushing off to his canvas to throw
    on some paint in his wonderful inimitable fashion!


    But he had to give up that idea of the Lady Macbeth picture all the
    same. I was the gainer, for he gave me the unfinished sketch, and it is
    certainly very beautiful.


    By this sketch hangs a tale of Mr. Sargent's great-heartedness. When the
    details of my jubilee performance at Drury Lane were being arranged, the
    Committee decided to ask certain distinguished artists to contribute to
    the programme. They were all delighted about it, and such busy men as
    Sir Laurence Alma-Tadema, Mr. Abbey, Mr.
    Byam Shaw, Mr.
    Walter Crane,
    Mr. Bernard Partridge, Mr. James Pryde, Mr. Orpen, and Mr.
    William
    Nicholson all gave some of their work to me. Mr. Sargent was asked if he
    would allow the first Lady Macbeth study to be reproduced. He found that
    it would not reproduce well, so in the height of the season and of his
    work with fashionable sitters, he did an entirely new painting of the
    same subject, which would reproduce! This act of kind friendship I
    could never forget even if the picture were not in front of me at this
    minute to remind me of it. "You must think of me as one of the people
    bowing down to you in the picture," he wrote to me when he sent the new
    version for the programme. Nothing during my jubilee celebrations
    touched me more than this wonderful kindness of Mr. Sargent's.

    Burne-Jones would have done something for my jubilee programme too, I
    think, had he lived. He was one of my kindest friends, and his
    letters       he was a heaven-born letter-writer       were like no one else's;
    full of charm and humor and feeling. Once when I was starting for a long
    tour in America he sent me a picture with this particularly charming
    letter:

                   "The Grange,
                  
"July 14, 1897.

                  
"My dear Miss Terry,       

                  
"I never have the courage to throw you a huge bouquet as I should like to       so in default I send you a little sign of my homage and admiration. I made it purposely for you, which is its only excellence, and thought nothing but gold good enough to paint with for you       and now it's done, I am woefully disappointed. It looks such a poor wretch of a thing, and there is no time to make another before you go, so look mercifully upon it       it did mean so well       as you would upon a foolish friend, not holding it up to the light, but putting it in a corner and never showing it.

                  
"As to what it is about, I think it's a little scene in Heaven (I am always pretending to know so much about that place!), a sort of patrol going to look to the battlements, some such thought as in Marlowe's lovely line: 'Now walk the angels on the walls of Heaven.' But I wanted it to be so different, and my old eyes cannot help me to finish it as I want       so forgive it and accept it with all its accompanying crowd of good wishes to you. They were always in my mind as I did it.

                  
"And come back soon from that America and stay here, and never go away again. Indeed I do wish you boundless happiness, and for our sake, such a length of life that you might shudder if I were to say how long.

                  
"Ever your poor artist,

                  
"E.B.-J.

                  
"If it is so faint that you can scarcely see it, let that stand for modest humility and shyness       as I had only dared to whisper."


    Another time, when I had sent him a trifle for some charity, he wrote:

                   "Dear Lady,       

                  
"This morning came the delightful crinkly paper that always means you! If anybody else ever used it, I think I should assault them! I certainly wouldn't read their letter or answer it.

                  
"And I know the check will be very useful. If I thought much about those wretched homes, or saw them often, I should do no more work, I know. There is but one thing to do       to help with a little money if you can manage it, and then try hard to forget. Yes, I am certain that I should never paint again if I saw much of those hopeless lives that have no remedy. I know of such a dear lad about my Phil's age who has felt this so sharply that he has given his happy, lucky, petted life to give himself wholly to share their squalor and unlovely lives       doing all he can, of evenings when his work is over, to amuse such as have the heart to be amused, reading to them and telling them about histories and what not       anything he knows that can entertain them. And this he has daily done for about a year, and if he carries it on for his life time he shall have such a nimbus that he will look top-heavy with it.

                  
"No, you would always have been lovely and made some beauty about you if you had been born there       but I should have got drunk and beaten my family and been altogether horrible! When everything goes just as I like, and painting prospers a bit, and the air is warm and friends well and everything perfectly comfortable, I can just manage to behave decently, and a spoilt fool I am       that's the truth. But wherever you were, some garden would grow.

                  
"Yes, I know Winchelsea and Rye and Lynn and Hythe       all bonny places, and Hythe has a church it may be proud of. Under the sea is another Winchelsea, a poor drowned city       about a mile out at sea, I think, always marked in old maps as 'Winchelsea Dround.' If ever the sea goes back on that changing coast there may be great fun when the spires and towers come up again. It's a pretty land to drive in.

                  
"I am growing downright stupid       I can't work at all, nor think of anything. Will my wits ever come back to me?

                  
"And when are you coming back       when will the Lyceum be in its rightful hands again? I refuse to go there till you come back...."
      
      
                   "Dear Lady,       

                  
"I have finished four pictures: come and tell me if they will do. I have worked so long at them that I know nothing about them, but I want you to see them       and like them if you can.

                  
"All Saturday and Sunday and Monday they are visible. Come any time you can that suits you best       only come.

                  
"I do hope you will like them. If you don't you must really pretend to, else I shall be heartbroken. And if I knew what time you would come and which day, I would get Margaret here.

                  
"I have had them about four years       long before I knew you, and now they are done and I can hardly believe it. But tell me pretty pacifying lies and say you like them, even if you find them rubbish.

                  
"Your devoted and affectionate

                  
"E.B.-J."


    I went the next day to see the pictures with Edy. It was the "Briar
    Rose" series. They were beautiful. The lovely Lady Granby (now
    Duchess
    of Rutland) was there       reminding me, as always, of the reflection of
    something in water on a misty day. When she was Miss Violet Lindsay she
    did a drawing of me as Portia in the doctor's robes, which is I think
    very like me, as well as having all the charming qualities of her
    well-known pencil portraits.


    The artists all loved the Lyceum, not only the old school, but the young
    ones, who could have been excused for thinking that Henry Irving and I
    were a couple of old fogeys! William Nicholson and James Pryde, who
    began by working together as "The Beggarstaff Brothers," and in this
    period did a poster of Henry for "Don Quixote" and another for "Becket,"
    were as enthusiastic about the Lyceum as Burne-Jones had been. Mr. Pryde
    has done an admirable portrait of me as Nance Oldfield, and his "Irving
    as Dubosc" shows the most extraordinary insight.

          

    
    

          

    ELLEN TERRY AS NANCE OLDFIELD

    From a hitherto unpublished portrait

          

    "I have really tried to draw his personality" he wrote to me thanking
    me for having said I liked the picture (it was done after Henry's
    death).... "Irving's eyes in Dubosc always made my hair stand on end,
    and I paid great attention to the fact that one couldn't exactly say
    whether they were shut or open. Very terrifying...."


    Mr. Rothenstein, to whom I once sat for a lithograph, was another of the
    young artists who came a good deal to the Lyceum. I am afraid that I
    must be a very difficult "subject," yet I sit easily enough, and don't
    mind being looked at       an objection which makes some sitters constrained
    and awkward before the painter. Poor Mr. Rothenstein was much worried
    over his lithograph, yet "it was all right on the night," as actors say.

                   "Dear Miss Terry,       

                  
"My nights have been sleepless       my drawing sitting gibbering on my chest. I knew how fearfully I should stumble       that is why I wanted to do more drawings earlier. I have been working on the thing this morning, and I believe I improved it slightly. What I want now is a cloak       the simplest you have (perhaps the green one?), which I think would be better than the less simple and worrying lace fallalas in the drawing. I can put it on the lay figure and sketch it into the horror over the old lines. I think the darker stuff will make the face blonde       more delicate. Please understand how nervously excited I have been over the wretched drawing, how short it falls of any suggestion of that personality of which I cannot speak to you       which I should some day like to give a shadow of....

    one example of what I mean. Mr. Seymour Lucas designed it, and there was
    great difficulty in finding a material rich enough and somber enough at
    the same time. No one was so clever on such quests as Mrs. Comyns Carr.
    She was never to be misled by the appearance of the stuff in the hand,
    nor impressed by its price by the yard, if she did not think it would
    look right on the stage. As Katherine she wanted me to wear steely
    silver and bronzy gold, but all the brocades had such insignificant
    designs. If they had a silver design on them it looked under the lights
    like a scratch in white cotton! At last Mrs. Carr found a black satin
    which on the right side was timorously and feebly patterned with a
    meandering rose and thistle. On the wrong side of it was a sheet of
    silver       just the right steely silver because it was the wrong side!
    Mrs. Carr then started on another quest for gold that should be as right
    as that silver. She found it at last in some gold-lace antimacassars at
    Whiteley's! From these base materials she and Mrs. Nettleship
    constructed a magnificent queenly dress. Its only fault was that it was
    heavy.


    But the weight that I can carry on the stage has often amazed me. I
    remember that for "King Arthur" Mrs. Nettleship made me a splendid
    cloak embroidered all over with a pattern in jewels. At the
    dress-rehearsal when I made my entrance the cloak swept magnificently
    and I daresay looked fine, but I knew at once that I should never be
    able to act in it. I called out to Mrs. Nettleship and Alice Carr, who
    were in the stalls, and implored them to lighten it of some of the
    jewels.


    "Oh, do keep it as it is," they answered, "it looks splendid."


    "I can't breathe in it, much less act in it. Please send some one up to
    cut off a few stones."


    I went on with my part, and then, during a wait, two of Mrs.
    Nettleship's assistants came on to the stage and snipped off a jewel
    here and there. When they had filled a basket, I began to feel better!


    But when they tried to lift that basket, their united efforts could not
    move it!


    On one occasion I wore a dress made in eight hours! During the first
    week of the run of "The Merry Wives of Windsor" at His Majesty's, there
    was a fire in my dressing-room       an odd fire which was never accounted
    for. In the morning they found the dress that I had worn as Mrs. Page
    burnt to a cinder. A messenger from His Majesty's went to tell my
    daughter, who had made the ill-fated dress:


    "Miss Terry will, I suppose, have to wear one of our dresses to-night.
    Perhaps you could make her a new one by the end of the week."


    "Oh, that will be all right," said Edy, bluffing, "I'll make her a dress
    by to-night." She has since told me that she did not really think she
    could make it in time!


    She had at this time a workshop in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. All
    hands were called into the service, and half an hour after the message
    came from the theater the new dress was started. That was at 10.30.
    Before 7 p.m. the new dress was in my dressing-room at His Majesty's
    Theater.


    And best of all, it was a great improvement on the dress that had been
    burned! It stood the wear and tear of the first run of "Merry Wives" and
    of all the revivals, and is still as fresh as paint!


    That very successful dress cost no time. Another very successful
    dress       the white one that I wore in the Court Scene in "A Winter's
    Tale," cost no money. My daughter made it out of material of which a
    sovereign must have covered the cost.


    My daughter says to know what not to do is the secret of making stage
    dresses. It is not a question of time or of money, but of omission.


    One of the best "audiences" that actor or actress could wish for was Mr.
    Gladstone. He used often to come and see the play at the Lyceum from a
    little seat in the O.P. entrance, and he nearly always arrived five
    minutes before the curtain went up. One night I thought he would catch
    cold       it was a bitter night       and I lent him my white scarf!


    He could always give his whole great mind to the matter in hand. This
    made him one of the most comfortable people to talk to that I have ever
    met. In everything he was thorough, and I don't think he could have
    been late for anything.


    I contrasted his punctuality, when he came to see "King Lear," with the
    unpunctuality of Lord Randolph Churchill, who came to see the play the
    very next night with a party of men friends and arrived when the first
    act was over.


    Lord Randolph was, all the same, a great admirer of Henry Irving. He
    confessed to him once that he had never read a play of Shakespeare's in
    his life, but that after seeing Henry act he thought it was time to
    begin! A very few days later he pulverized us with his complete and
    masterly knowledge of at least half a dozen of the plays. He was a
    perfect person to meet at a dinner or supper       brilliantly entertaining,
    and queerly simple. He struck one as being able to master any subject
    that interested him, and once a Shakespeare performance at the Lyceum
    had fired his interest, there was nothing about that play, or about past
    performances of it, which he did not know! His beautiful wife (now Mrs.
    George Cornwallis West) wore a dress at supper one evening which gave me
    the idea for the Lady Macbeth dress, afterwards painted by Sargent. The
    bodice of Lady Randolph's gown was trimmed all over with green beetles'
    wings. I told Mrs. Comyns Carr about it, and she remembered it when she
    designed my Lady Macbeth dress and saw to its making by clever Mrs.
    Nettleship.


    Lady Randolph Churchill by sheer force of beauty of face and
    expressiveness would, I venture to prophesy, have been successful on the
    stage if fate had ever led her to it.

          

    "BEEFSTEAK" GUESTS AT THE LYCEUM


    The present Princess of Wales, when she was Princess May of Teck, used
    often to come to the Lyceum with her mother, Princess Mary, and to
    supper in the Beefsteak Room. In 1891 she chose to come as her birthday
    treat, which was very flattering to us.


    A record of those Beefsteak Room suppers would be a pleasant thing to
    possess. I have such a bad memory       I see faces round the table       the face
    of Liszt among them       and when I try to think when it was, or how it was,
    the faces vanish as people might out of a room when, after having
    watched them through a dim window-pane, one determines to open the
    door       and go in.


    Lady Dorothy Nevill, that distinguished lady of the old school       what a
    picture of a woman!       was always a fine theater-goer. Her face always
    cheered me if I saw it in the theater, and she was one of the most
    clever and amusing of the Beefsteak Room guests. As a hostess, sitting
    in her round chair, with her hair dressed to become her, irrespective
    of any period, leading this, that and the other of her guests to speak
    upon their particular subjects, she was simply the ideal.


    Singers were often among Henry Irving's guests in the Beefsteak
    Room       Patti, Melba, Calvé, Albani,
    Sims Reeves, Tamagno,
    Victor Maurel,
    and many others.


    Calvé! The New York newspapers wrote "Salve Calvé!" and I would echo
    them. She is the best singer-actress that I know. They tell me that
    Grisi and Mario were fine dramatically. When I saw them, they were on
    the point of retiring, and I was a child. I remember that Madame Grisi
    was very stout, but Mario certainly acted well. Trebelli was a noble
    actress; Maria Gay is splendid, and oh! Miss
    Mary Garden! Never shall I
    forget her acting in "Griselidis." Yet for all the talent of these
    singers whom I have named, and among whom I should surely have placed
    the incomparable Maurel, whose Iago was superb, I think that the arts of
    singing and acting can seldom be happily married. They quarrel all the
    while! A few operas seem to have been written with a knowledge of the
    difficulty of the conventions which intervene to prevent the expression
    of dramatic emotion; and these operas are contrived with amazing
    cleverness so that the acting shall have free play. Verdi in "Othello,"
    and Bizet in "Carmen" came nearest solving the problem.


    To go back to Calvé. She has always seemed to me a darling, as well as a
    great artist. She was entirely generous and charming to me when we were
    living for some weeks together in the same New York hotel. One wonderful
    Sunday evening I remember dining with her, and she sang and sang for me,
    as if she could never grow tired. One thing she said she had never sung
    so well before, and she laughed in her delicious rapturous way and sang
    it all over again.


    Her enthusiasm for acting, music, and her fellow-artists was
    magnificent. Oh, what a lovable creature! Such soft dark eyes and
    entreating ways, such a beautiful mixture of nobility and "câlinerie"!
    She would laugh and cry all in a moment like a child. That year in New
    York she was raved about, but all the excitement and enthusiasm that she
    created only seemed to please and amuse her. She was not in the least
    spoiled by the fuss.


    I once watched Patti sing from behind scenes at the Metropolitan Opera
    House, New York. My impression from that point of view was that she was
    actually a bird! She could not help singing! Her head, flattened on
    top, her nose tilted downwards like a lovely little beak, her throat
    swelling and swelling as it poured out that extraordinary volume of
    sound, all made me think that she must have been a nightingale before
    she was transmigrated into a human being! Near, I was amazed by the
    loudness of her song. I imagine that Tetrazzini, whom I have not yet
    heard, must have this bird-like quality.


    The dear kind-hearted Melba has always been a good friend of mine. The
    first time I met her was in New York at a supper party, and she had a
    bad cold, and therefore a frightful speaking voice for the moment! I
    shall never forget the shock that it gave me. Thank goodness I very soon
    afterwards heard her again when she hadn't a cold!


    "All's well that ends well." It ended very well. She spoke as
    exquisitely as she sang. She was one of the first to offer her services
    for my jubilee performance at Drury Lane, but unfortunately she was ill
    when the day came, and could not sing. She had her dresses in "Faust"
    copied from mine by Mrs. Nettleship, and I came across a note from her
    the other day thanking me for having introduced her to a dressmaker who
    was "an angel." Another note sent round to me during a performance of
    "King Arthur" in Boston I shall always prize.

                   "You are sublime, adorable ce soir.... I wish I were a millionaire       I would throw all my millions at your feet. If there is another procession, tell the stage manager to see those imps of Satan don't chew gum. It looks awful.

                  
"Love,

                  
"MELBA"


    I think that time it was the solemn procession of mourners following the
    dead body of Elaine who were chewing gum; but we always had to be
    prepared for it among our American "supers," whether they were angels or
    devils or courtiers!


    In "Faust" we "carried" about six leading witches for the Brocken Scene,
    and recruited the forty others from local talent in the different towns
    that we visited. Their general direction was to throw up their arms and
    look fierce at certain music cues. One night I noticed a girl going
    through the most terrible contortions with her jaw, and thought I must
    say something.


    "That's right, dear. Very good, but don't exaggerate."


    "How?" was all the answer that I got in the choicest nasal twang, and
    the girl continued to make faces as before.


    I was contemplating a second attempt, when Templeton, the limelight man,
    who had heard me speak to her, touched me gently on the shoulder.


    "Beg pardon, miss, she don't mean it. She's only chewing gum!"


    One of my earliest friends among literary folk was Mr. Charles
    Dodgson       or Lewis Carroll       or "Alice in Wonderland." Ah, that conveys
    something to you! I can't remember when I didn't know him. I think he
    must have seen Kate act as a child, and having given her "Alice"       he
    always gave his young friends "Alice" at once by way of establishing
    pleasant relations       he made a progress as the years went on through the
    whole family. Finally he gave "Alice" to my children.


    He was a splendid theater-goer, and took the keenest interest in all
    the Lyceum productions, frequently writing to me to point out slips in
    the dramatist's logic which only he would ever have noticed! He did not
    even spare Shakespeare. I think he wrote these letters for fun, as some
    people make puzzles, anagrams, or Limericks!


  
                   "Now I'm going to put before you a 'Hero-ic' puzzle of mine, but please remember I do not ask for your solution of it, as you will persist in believing, if I ask your help in a Shakespeare difficulty, that I am only jesting! However, if you won't attack it yourself, perhaps you would ask Mr. Irving some day how he explains it?

                  
"My difficulty is this:       Why in the world did not Hero (or at any rate Beatrice on her behalf) prove an 'alibi' in answer to the charge? It seems certain that she did not sleep in her room that night; for how could Margaret venture to open the window and talk from it, with her mistress asleep in the room? It would be sure to wake her. Besides Borachio says, after promising that Margaret shall speak with him out of Hero's chamber window, 'I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent.' (How he could possibly manage any such thing is another difficulty, but I pass over that.) Well then, granting that Hero slept in some other room that night, why didn't she say so? When Claudio asks her: 'What man was he talked with yesternight out at your window betwixt twelve and one?' why doesn't she reply: 'I talked with no man at that hour, my lord. Nor was I in my chamber yesternight, but in another, far from it, remote.' And this she could, of course, prove by the evidence of the housemaids, who must have known that she had occupied another room that night.

                  
"But even if Hero might be supposed to be so distracted as not to remember where she had slept the night before, or even whether she had slept anywhere, surely Beatrice has her wits about her! And when an arrangement was made, by which she was to lose, for one night, her twelve-months' bedfellow, is it conceivable that she didn't know where Hero passed the night? Why didn't she reply:

                  
"But good my lord sweet Hero slept not there:
                  
She had another chamber for the nonce.
                  
'Twas sure some counterfeit that did present
                  
Her person at the window, aped her voice,
                  
Her mien, her manners, and hath thus deceived
                  
My good Lord Pedro and this company?'

                  
"With all these excellent materials for proving an 'alibi' it is incomprehensible that no one should think of it. If only there had been a barrister present, to cross-examine Beatrice!

                  
"'Now, ma'am, attend to me, please, and speak up so that the jury can hear you. Where did you sleep last night? Where did Hero sleep? Will you swear that she slept in her own room? Will you swear that you do not know where she slept?' I feel inclined to quote old Mr. Weller and to say to Beatrice at the end of the play (only I'm afraid it isn't etiquette to speak across the footlights):

                  
"'Oh, Samivel, Samivel, vy vornt there a halibi?'"

  


    Mr. Dodgson's kindness to children was wonderful. He really loved them
    and put himself out for them. The children he knew who wanted to go on
    the stage were those who came under my observation, and nothing could
    have been more touching than his ceaseless industry on their behalf.


  
                   "I want to thank you," he wrote to me in 1894 from Oxford, "as heartily as words can do it for your true kindness in letting me bring D. behind the scenes to you. You will know without my telling you what an intense pleasure you thereby gave to a warm-hearted girl, and what love (which I fancy you value more than mere admiration) you have won from her. Her wild longing to try the stage will not, I think, bear the cold light of day when once she has tried it, and has realized what a lot of hard work and weary waiting and 'hope deferred' it involves. She doesn't, so far as I know, absolutely need, as N. does, to earn money for her own support. But I fancy she will find life rather a pinch, unless she can manage to do something in the way of earning money. So I don't like to advise her strongly against it, as I would with any one who had no such need.

                  
"Also thank you, thank you with all my heart, for all your great kindness to N. She does write so brightly and gratefully about all you do for her and say to her."

  


    "N." has since achieved great success on the music-halls and in
    pantomime. "D." is a leading lady!


    This letter to my sister Floss is characteristic of his "Wonderland"
    style when writing to children:

                   "Ch. Ch., January, 1874.

                  
"My dear Florence,       

                  
"Ever since that heartless piece of conduct of yours (I allude to the affair of the Moon and the blue silk gown) I have regarded you with a gloomy interest, rather than with any of the affection of former years       so that the above epithet 'dear' must be taken as conventional only, or perhaps may be more fitly taken in the sense in which we talk of a 'dear' bargain, meaning to imply how much it has cost us; and who shall say how many sleepless nights it has cost me to endeavor to unravel (a most appropriate verb) that 'blue silk gown'?

                  
"Will you please explain to Tom about that photograph of the family group which I promised him? Its history is an instructive one, as illustrating my habits of care and deliberation. In 1867 the picture was promised him, and an entry made in my book. In 1869, or thereabouts, I mounted the picture on a large card, and packed it in brown paper. In 1870, or 1871, or thereabouts, I took it with me to Guilford, that it might be handy to take with me when I went up to town. Since then I have taken it two or three times to London, and on each occasion (having forgotten to deliver it to him) I brought it back again. This was because I had no convenient place in London to leave it in. But now I have found such a place. Mr. Dubourg has kindly taken charge of it       so that it is now much nearer to its future owner than it has been for seven years. I quite hope, in the course of another year or two, to be able to remember to bring it to your house: or perhaps Mr. Dubourg may be calling even sooner than that and take it with him. You will wonder why I ask you to tell him instead of writing myself. The obvious reason is that you will be able, from sympathy, to put my delay in the most favorable light       to make him see that, as hasty puddings are not the best of puddings so hasty judgments are not the best of judgments, and that he ought to be content to wait even another seven years for his picture, and to sit 'like patience on a monument, smiling at grief.' This quotation, by the way, is altogether a misprint. Let me explain it to you. The passage originally stood, 'They sit like patients on the Monument, smiling at Greenwich.' In the next edition 'Greenwich' was printed short, 'Green'h,' and so got gradually altered into 'grief.' The allusion of course is to the celebrated Dr. Jenner, who used to send all his patients to sit on the top of the Monument (near London Bridge) to inhale fresh air, promising them that, when they were well enough, they should go to 'Greenwich Fair.' So of course they always looked out towards Greenwich, and sat smiling to think of the treat in store for them. A play was written on the subject of their inhaling the fresh air, and was for some time attributed to him (Shakespeare), but it is certainly not in his style. It was called 'The Wandering Air,' and was lately revived at the Queen's Theater. The custom of sitting on the Monument was given up when Dr. Jenner went mad, and insisted on it that the air was worse up there and that the lower you went the more airy it became. Hence he always called those little yards, below the pavement, outside the kitchen windows, 'the kitchen airier,' a name that is still in use.

                  
"All this information you are most welcome to use, the next time you are in want of something to talk about. You may say you learned it from 'a distinguished etymologist,' which is perfectly true, since any one who knows me by sight can easily distinguish me from all other etymologists.

"L. DODGSON."


    No two men could be more unlike than Mr. Dodgson and Mr. J.M. Barrie,
    yet there are more points of resemblance than "because there's a 'b' in
    both!"


    If "Alice in Wonderland" is the children's classic of the library, and
    one perhaps even more loved by the grown up children than by the others,
    "Peter Pan" is the children's stage classic, and here again elderly
    children are the most devoted admirers. I am a very old child, nearly
    old enough to be a "beautiful great-grandmother" (a part that I have
    entreated Mr. Barrie to write for me), and I go and see "Peter" year
    after year and love him more each time. There is one advantage in being
    a grown-up child       you are not afraid of the pirates or the crocodile.


    I first became an ardent lover of Mr. Barrie through "Sentimental
    Tommy," and I simply had to write and tell him how hugely I had enjoyed
    it. In reply I had a letter from Tommy himself!

                   "Dear Miss Ellen Terry,       

                  
"I just wonder at you. I noticed that Mr. Barrie the author (so-called) and his masterful wife had a letter they wanted to conceal from me, so I got hold of it, and it turned out to be from you, and not a line to me in it! If you like the book, it is me you like, not him, and it is to me you should send your love, not to him. Corp thinks, however, that you did not like to make the first overtures, and if that is the explanation, I beg herewith to send you my warm love (don't mention this to Elspeth) and to say that I wish you would come and have a game with us in the Den (don't let on to Grizel that I invited you). The first moment I saw you, I said to myself, 'This is the kind I like,' and while the people round about me were only thinking of your acting, I was wondering which would be the best way of making you my willing slave, and I beg to say that I believe I have 'found a way,' for most happily the very ones I want most to lord it over, are the ones who are least able to resist me.

                  
"We should have ripping fun. You would be Jean MacGregor, captive in the Queen's Bower, but I would climb up at the peril of my neck to rescue you, and you would faint in my strong arms, and wouldn't Grizel get a turn when she came upon you and me whispering sweet nothings in the Lovers' Walk? I think it advisible to say in writing that I would only mean them as nothings (because Grizel is really my one), but so long as they were sweet, what does that matter (at the time); and besides, you could love me genuinely, and I would carelessly kiss your burning tears away.

                  
"Corp is a bit fidgety about it, because he says I have two to love me already, but I feel confident that I can manage more than two.

"P.S.       Can you bring some of the Lyceum armor with you, and two hard-boiled eggs?"


    Henry Irving once thought of producing Mr. Barrie's play "The
    Professor's Love Story." He was delighted with the first act, but when
    he had read the rest he did not think the play would do for the Lyceum.
    It was the same with many plays which were proposed for us. The ideas
    sounded all right, but as a rule the treatment was too thin, and the
    play, even if good, on too small a scale for the theater.


    One of our playwrights of whom I always expected a great play was
    Mrs. Craigie (John Oliver Hobbes). A little one-act play of hers, "Journeys
    End in Lovers' Meeting"       in which I first acted with Johnston
    Forbes-Robertson and Terriss at a special matinée in 1894       brought about
    a friendship between us which lasted until her death. Of her it could
    indeed be said with poignant truth, "She should have died hereafter."
    Her powers had not nearly reached their limit.


    Pearl Craigie had a man's intellect       a woman's wit and apprehension.
    "Bright," as the Americans say, she always managed to be even in the
    dullest company, and she knew how to be silent at times, to give the
    "other fellow" a chance. Her executive ability was extraordinary.
    Wonderfully tolerant, she could at the same time not easily forgive any
    meanness or injustice that seemed to her deliberate. Hers was a splendid
    spirit.


    I shall always bless that little play of hers which first brought me
    near to so fine a creature. I rather think that I never met any one who
    gave out so much as she did. To me, at least, she gave, gave all the
    time. I hope she was not exhausted after our long "confabs." I was
    most certainly refreshed and replenished.


    The first performance of "Journeys End in Lovers' Meeting" she watched
    from a private box with the Princess of Wales (our present
    Queen) and
    Henry Irving. She came round afterwards just burning with enthusiasm
    and praising me for work which was really not good. She spoiled one for
    other women.


    Her best play was, I think, "The Ambassador," in which Violet Vanbrugh
    (now Mrs. Bourchier) played a pathetic part very beautifully, and made a
    great advance in her profession.


    There was some idea of Pearl Craigie writing a play for Henry Irving and
    me, but it never came to anything. There was a play of hers on the same
    subject as "The School for Saints," and another about Guizot.

                   "February 11, 1898.

                  
"My very dear Nell,       

                  
"I have an idea for a real four-act comedy (in these matters nothing daunts me!) founded on a charming little episode in the private lives of Princess Lieven (the famous Russian ambassadress) and the celebrated Guizot, the French Prime Minister and historian. I should have to veil the identity slightly, and also make the story a husband and wife story       it would be more amusing this way. It is comedy from beginning to end. Sir Henry would make a splendid Guizot, and you the ideal Madame de Lieven. Do let me talk it over with you. 'The School for Saints' was, as it were, a born biography. But the Lieven-Guizot idea is a play.

                  
"Yours ever affectionately,

                  
"PEARL MARY THERESA CRAIGIE."


    In another letter she writes:


  
"I am changing all my views about so-called 'literary' dialogue. It means pedantry. The great thing is to be lively."
  


    "A first night at the Lyceum" was an institution. I don't think that it
    has its parallel nowadays. It was not, however, to the verdict of all
    the brilliant friends who came to see us on the first night that Henry
    Irving attached importance. I remember some one saying to him after the
    first night of "Ravenswood": "I don't fancy that your hopes will be
    quite fulfilled about the play. I heard one or two on Saturday night       "


    "Ah yes," said Henry very carelessly and gently, "but you see there were
    so many friends there that night who didn't pay       friends. One must
    not expect too much from friends! The paying public will, I think,
    decide favorably."


    Henry never cared much for society, as the saying is       but as host in the
    Beefsteak Room he thoroughly enjoyed himself, and every one who came to
    his suppers seemed happy! Every conceivable type of person used to be
    present       and there, if one had the mind16 one could study the world
    in little.


    One of the liveliest guests was Sir Francis Burnand       who entirely
    contradicted the theory that professional comedians are always the most
    gloomy of men in company.


    A Sunday evening with the Burnand family at their home in The Bottoms
    was a treat Henry Irving and I often looked forward to       a particularly
    restful, lively evening. I think a big family       a "party" in itself       is
    the only "party" I like. Some of the younger Burnands have greatly
    distinguished themselves, and they are all perfect dears, so unaffected,
    kind, and genial.


    Sir Francis never jealously guarded his fun for Punch. He was always
    generous with it. Once when my son had an exhibition of his pictures, I
    asked Mr. Burnand, as he was then, to go and see it or send some one on
    Mr. Punch's staff. He answered characteristically!

                   "WHITEFRIARS,
                  
"London, E.C.

                  
"My dear Ellen Terry,       

                  
"Delighted to see your hand       'wish your face were with it' (Shakespeare).

                  
"Remember me (Shakespeare again       'Hamlet') to our Sir Henry. May you both live long and prosper!

    BITS FROM MY DIARY 


    What is a diary as a rule? A document useful to the person who keeps it,
    dull to the contemporary who reads it, invaluable to the student,
    centuries afterwards, who treasures it!


    Whatever interest the few diaries of mine that I have preserved may have
    for future psychologists and historians, they are for my present purpose
    almost worthless. Yet because things written at the time are considered
    by some people to be more reliable than those written years afterwards
    when memory calls in imagination to her help, I have hunted up a few
    passages from my diaries between 1887 and 1901; and now I give them in
    the raw for what they are worth       in my opinion nothing!


  
                        July 1887.       E.B.-J. (Sir Edward Burne-Jones) sent me a picture he has painted for me       a troop of little angels.


                        August 2.       (We were in Scotland.) Visited the "Blasted Heath." Behold a flourishing potato field! Smooth softness everywhere. We must blast our own heath when we do Macbeth!


                        November 29       -(We were in America.) Matinée "Faust"       Beecher Memorial. The whole affair was the strangest failure. H.I. himself took heaps of tickets, but the house was half empty.

                  
The following Saturday.       Matinée "Faust." House crammed. Why couldn't they have come when it was to honor Beecher?


                        January 1890.       In answer to some one who has said that Henry had all his plays written for him, he pointed out that of twenty-eight Lyceum productions only three were written "for" him       "Charles I.," "Eugene Aram," and "Vanderdecken."


                        February 27.       (My birthday.) Henry gave me a most exquisite wreath for the head. It is made of green stones and diamonds and is like a myrtle wreath. I never saw anything so simple and grand. It's lovely.

  


    (During this year our readings of "Macbeth" took place.)


  
                        April.       Visit to Trentham after the reading at Hanley. Next day to hotel at Bradford, where there were beetles in the beds!

                  
I see that Bulwer, speaking of Macready's Macbeth, says that Macbeth was a "trembler when opposed by his conscience, a warrior when defied by his foes."


                        August.       (At Winchelsea.) We drove to Cliffe End. Henry got the old pony along at a spanking rate, but I had to seize the reins now and again to save us from sudden death.


                        August 14.       Drove to Tenterden. Saw Clowe's Marionettes.
  


    (Henry saw one of their play-bills in a shop window, but found that the
    performances only took place in the evening. He found out the proprietor
    and asked him what were the takings on a good night. The man said £5, I
    think. Henry asked him if he would give him a special show for that sum.
    He was delighted. Henry and I and my daughter Edy and
    Fussie sat in
    solemn state in the empty tent and watched the show, which was most
    ingenious and clever. Clowe's Marionettes are still "on the road," but
    ever since that "command" performance of Henry's at Tenterden their bill
    has had two extra lines:
"Patronized by SIR HENRY IRVING
and
MISS ELLEN TERRY.")
      

  


                        September.       "Method," (in last act of "Ravenswood"), "to keep very still, and feel it all quietly and deeply." George Meredith, speaking of Romance, says: "The young who avoid that region, escape the title of Fool at the cost of a Celestial Crown." Good!


                        December.       Mr. Gladstone behind the scenes. He likes the last act very much.


                        January 14, 1892.       Prince Eddie died. Cardinal Manning died.


                        January 18.       (Just after successful production of "Henry VIII.") H.I. is hard at work, studying "Lear." This is what only a great man would do at such a moment in the hottest blush of success. No "swelled head"       only fervent endeavor to do better work. The fools hardly conceive what he is.


                        February 8.       Morell Mackenzie died.


                        March 1.       Mother died. Amazing courage in my father and sisters. She looked so lovely when she was dead.


                        March 7.       Went back to work.


                        October 6.       Tennyson died.


                        October 26.       A fine day. To call on the young Duchess of S              . What a sweet and beautiful young girl she is! I said I would write and ask
Mrs. Stirling to give her lessons, but feared she could not as she was ill.


                        November.       Heard from Mrs. Stirling: "I am too ill and weak to see any one in the way of lessons. I am just alive       in pain and distress always, but always anxious for news from the Lyceum. 'Lear' will be a great success, I am sure. I was Cordelia with Macready."


                        November 10.       First night of "Lear." Such a foggy day! H. was just marvelous, but indistinct from nervousness. T. spoke out, but who cared! Haviland was very good. My
Ted splendid in the little bit he had to do as Oswald. I was rather good to-night. It is a wee part, but fine.


                        December 7.       Poor Fred Leslie is dead. Typhoid. A thunderbolt to us all. Poor, bright, charming Fred Leslie!


                        December 31.       This has been a dark year. Mother died. Illness rife in the family. My son engaged       but that may turn out well if the young couple will not be too hasty. H.I. not well. Business by no means up to the proper point. A death in the Royal Family. Depression       depression!


                        March 9, 1897.       Eunice (Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher) is dead. Poor darling! She was a great friend to me.


                        April 10.       First night of "Sans-Gêne." A wonderful first-night audience. I acted courageously and fairly well. Extraordinary success.


                        April 14.       Princess Louise (Lorne) came to see the play and told me she was delighted. Little Elspeth Campbell was with her, looking lovely. I did not play well       was depressed and clumsy.


                        May 13.       It's all off about "The Man of Destiny" play with H.I. and
G.B.S.


                        May 15.       To "Princess and Butterfly" with Audrey and Aimée. Miss Fay Davis better than ever.


                        May 17       -Nutcombe Gould has lost his voice, and Ted was called upon at a moment's notice to play Hamlet at the Olympic to-night.


                        June 20.       Thanksgiving Service at St. Paul's for the
Queen's Jubilee. Went with Edy and Henry. Not at all adequate to the occasion was the ceremony. The Te Deum rather good, the sermon sensible, but the whole uninspired, unimpassioned and dull. The Prince and
Princess looked splendid.


                        June 22.       To Lady Glenesk's, Piccadilly. Wonderfullest sight I ever saw. All was perfect, but the little Queen herself more dignified than the whole procession put together!
Sarah B. was in her place at the Glenesks' at six in the morning.
Bancroft made a Knight. Mrs. Alma-Tadema's "at home."
Paderewski played. What a divinely beautiful face!


                        July 14.       The Women's Jubilee Dinner at the Grafton Galleries. Too ill to go. My guests were H.I.,
Burne-Jones, Max Beerbohm,
W. Nicholson, Jimmy Pryde,
Will Rothenstein, Graham Robertson,
Richard Harding Davis, Laurence Irving, Ted and
Edy.


                        December 11.       (In Manchester.) Poor old Fussie dropped down a trap 30 feet and died in a second.


                  December 16.       Willie Terriss was murdered this evening.                         Newspapers sent me a wire for "expressions of sympathy"!!


                        January 22, 1901.       (Tenterden.) Nine o'clock evening and the bell is tolling for our dearest Queen       Victoria, who died this evening just before seven o'clock       a grand, wise, good woman. A week ago she was driving out regularly. The courage of it!


                        January 23.       To Rye (from Winchelsea). The King proclaimed in the Market Place. The ceremony only took about five minutes. Very dull and undignified until the National Anthem, which upset us all.


                        January 26.       London last night when I arrived might have been Winchelsea when the sun goes down on all our wrath and arguments. No one in the streets ... empty buses crawling along. Black boards up at every shop window. All the gas half-mast high as well as the flags. I never saw such a mournful city, but why should they turn the gas down? Thrift, thrift, Horatio!


                        February 2.       The Queen's Funeral. From a balcony in S. James's I saw the most wonderful sight I have ever seen. The silence was extraordinary.... The tiny coffin on the gun-carriage drawn by the cream-colored ponies was the most pathetic, impressive object in all that great procession. All the grandest carriages were out for the occasion. The King and the German Emperor rode side by side.... The young Duke of Coburg, the Duchess of Albany's son, like Sir Galahad. I slept at Bridgewater House, but on my way to St. James's from there my clothes were torn and I was half squeezed to death. One man called out to me: "Ah, now you know what it feels like at the pit door, Miss Terry."


                        April 15.       Lyceum. "Coriolanus" produced. Went home directly after the play was over. I didn't seem to know a word of my part yesterday at the dress-rehearsal, but to-night I was as firm as if I had played it a hundred times.


                        April 16.       The critics who wrote their notices at the dress-rehearsal, and complained of my playing pranks with the text, were a little previous. Oh, how bad it makes one feel to find that they all think my Volumnia "sweet," and I thought I was fierce, contemptuous, overbearing. Worse, I felt as if I must be appearing like a cabman rating his Drury Lane wife!


                        April 20.       Beginning to play Volumnia a little better.


                        June 25.       Revival of "Charles I." The play went marvelously. I played first and last acts well. H. was magnificent. Ted saw play yesterday and says I don't "do Mrs. Siddons well." I know what he means. The last act too declamatory.


                        June 26.       Changed the "Mrs. Siddons" scene, and like it much better. Simpler       more nature       more feeling.


                        July 16.       Horrible suicide of Edith and Ida Yeoland. The poor girls were out of an engagement. Unequal to the fight for life.


                        July 20.       Last day of Lyceum season       "Coriolanus."

  


    (On that night, I remember, H.I. for the first time played Coriolanus
    beautifully. He discarded the disfiguring beard of the warrior that he
    had worn during the "run" earlier in the season       and now that one could
    see his face, all was well. When people speak of the evils of long runs,
    I should like to answer with a list of their advantages. An actor, even
    an actor of Henry Irving's caliber, hardly begins to play an immense
    part like Coriolanus for what it is worth until he has been doing it for
    fifty nights.)


  
                        November 16.       "New York. Saw delightful
Maude Adams in 'Quality Street'       charming play. She is most clever and attractive.
     Unusual above everything. Queer, sweet, entirely delightful."

  


    From these extracts, I hope it will be seen that by burning most of my
    diaries I did not inflict an unbearable loss upon present readers, or
    posterity!


    I am afraid that I think as little of the future as I do of the past.
    The present for me!


    If my impressions of my friends are scanty, let me say in my defense
    that actors and actresses necessarily see many people, but know very
    few.


    If there has been more in this book about my life in the theater than
    about my life outside it, the proportion is inevitable and natural. The
    maxim is well-worn that art is long and life is short, and there is no
    art, I think, which is longer than mine! At least, it always seems to me
    that no life can be long enough to meet its requirements.


    If I have not revealed myself to you, or succeeded in giving a faithful
    picture of an actor's life, perhaps I have shown what years of practice
    and labor are needed for the attainment of a permanent position on the
    stage. To quote Mrs. Nancy Oldfield:       

"Art needs all that we can bring to her, I assure you."

    FOOTNOTES





1 Since I wrote this, I have again visited my native town--this
time to receive its civic congratulations on the occasion of my jubilee, and as
recently as March of the present year I acted at the new Empire Theater.


2 Of course, all salaries are bigger now than they were then.
    The "stars" in old days earned large sums       Edmund Kean received two
    hundred and fifty pounds for four performances       but the ordinary members
    of a company were paid at a very moderate rate. I received fifteen
    shillings a week at the Princess's until I played Puck, when my salary
    was doubled.       E.T.


3 Edward FitzGerald.


4 A "join" in theatrical wig-makers' parlance is the point
    where the front-piece of the wig ends and the actor's forehead begins.]



5 This was a favorite story of Henry Irving's, and for that
reason alone I think it worth telling, although Sir Squire Bancroft assures me
that stubborn dates make it impossible that the tale should be true.


6 Mr. A.B. Walkley, the gifted dramatic critic of The
    Times.


7 From my Diary, June 1, 1887.       "Westland-Marston Benefit
    at the Lyceum. A triumphant success entirely due to the genius and
    admirable industry and devotion of H.I., for it is just the dullest play
    to read as ever was! He made it intensely interesting.      


8 Alexander had just succeeded Terriss as our leading young
man.


9 Wenman had a rolling bass voice of which he was very proud.
    He was a valuable actor, yet somehow never interesting. Young Norman
    Forbes-Robertson played Sir Andrew Ague Cheak with us on our second American
tour.


10 Once when Allen was rehearsing the supers in the Church
    Scene in "Much Ado about Nothing," we overheard him show the sense in
    Shakespeare like this:


    "This 'Ero let me tell you is a perfect lady, a nice, innercent young
    thing, and when the feller she's engaged to calls 'er an 'approved
    wanton,' you naturally claps yer 'ands to yer swords. A wanton is a kind
    of       well, you know she ain't what she ought to be!"


    Allen would then proceed to read the part of Claudio:

"... not to knit my soul to an approved wanton."


    Seven or eight times the supers clapped their "'ands to their swords"
    without giving Allen satisfaction.


    "No, no, no, that's not a bit like it, not a bit! If any of your sisters
    was 'ere and you 'eard me call 'er a               , would yer stand gapin' at me
    as if this was a bloomin' tea party!      


11 The stage-door keeper.


12 A quotation from       The Bells.      


13 I am sorry to say that since I wrote this The Tribune,
after a gallant fight for life, has gone to join the company of the courageous
enterprises which have failed.


14 Mr. Norman Forbes-Robertson.


15 Every lover of beauty and every lover of Henry Irving must
have breathed a silent thanksgiving that day to the friends who had that
inspiration and made the pall with their own hands.


16 "Wordsworth says he could write like Shakespeare if he had
    the mind. Obviously it is only the mind that is lacking."       Charles
    Lamb's Letters.

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
