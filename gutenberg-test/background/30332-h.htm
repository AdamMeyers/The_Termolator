<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">O</span> <span class="caps">love</span>, this morn when the sweet nightingale</span><br />
Had so long finished all he had to say,<br />
That thou hadst slept, and sleep had told his tale;<br />
And midst a peaceful dream had stolen away<br />
In fragrant dawning of the first of May,<br />
Didst thou see aught? didst thou hear voices sing<br />
Ere to the risen sun the bells 'gan ring?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For then methought the Lord of Love went by</span><br />
To take possession of his flowery throne,<br />
Ringed round with maids, and youths, and minstrelsy;<br />
A little while I sighed to find him gone,<br />
A little while the dawning was alone,<br />
And the light gathered; then I held my breath,<br />
And shuddered at the sight of Eld and Death.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Alas! Love passed me in the twilight dun,</span><br />
His music hushed the wakening ousel's song;<br />
But on these twain shone out the golden sun,<br />
And o'er their heads the brown bird's tune was strong,<br />
As shivering, twixt the trees they stole along;<br />
None noted aught their noiseless passing by,<br />
The world had quite forgotten it must die.</p></div>

That they had lived to see May once more smile<br />
Upon the earth; wherefore, as men who know<br />
How fast the bad days and the good days go,<br />
They gathered at the feast: the fair abode<br />
Wherein they sat, o'erlooked, across the road<br />
Unhedged green meads, which willowy streams passed through,<br />
And on that morn, before the fresh May dew<br />
Had dried upon the sunniest spot of grass,<br />
From bush to bush did youths and maidens pass<br />
In raiment meet for May apparelled,<br />
Gathering the milk-white blossoms and the red;<br />
And now, with noon long past, and that bright day<br />
Growing aweary, on the sunny way<br />
They wandered, crowned with flowers, and loitering,<br />
And weary, yet were fresh enough to sing<br />
The carols of the morn, and pensive, still<br />
Had cast away their doubt of death and ill,<br />
And flushed with love, no more grew red with shame.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So to the elders as they sat, there came,</span><br />
With scent of flowers, the murmur of that folk<br />
Wherethrough from time to time a song outbroke,<br />
Till scarce they thought about the story due;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>Yet, when anigh to sun-setting it grew,<br />
A book upon the board an elder laid,<br />
And turning from the open window said,<br />
"Too fair a tale the lovely time doth ask,<br />
For this of mine to be an easy task,<br />
Yet in what words soever this is writ,<br />
As for the matter, I dare say of it<br />
That it is lovely as the lovely May;<br />
Pass then the manner, since the learned say<br />
No written record was there of the tale,<br />
Ere we from our fair land of Greece set sail;<br />
How this may be I know not, this I know<br />
That such-like tales the wind would seem to blow<br />
From place to place, e'en as the feathery seed<br />
Is borne across the sea to help the need<br />
Of barren isles; so, sirs, from seed thus sown,<br />
This flower, a gift from other lands has grown.</p></div>

<h2>THE STORY OF CUPID AND PSYCHE.</h2>
<h3>ARGUMENT.</h3>

<p class="hang">Psyche, a king's daughter, by her exceeding beauty caused the people
to forget Venus; therefore the goddess would fain have destroyed her:
nevertheless she became the bride of Love, yet in an unhappy moment
lost him by her own fault, and wandering through the world suffered
many evils at the hands of Venus, for whom she must accomplish fearful
tasks. But the gods and all nature helped her, and in process of time
she was reunited to Love, forgiven by Venus, and made immortal by the
Father of gods and men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span class="big">I</span><span class="caps">n</span> the Greek land of old there was a King<br />
Happy in battle, rich in everything;<br />
Most rich in this, that he a daughter had<br />
Whose beauty made the longing city glad.<br />
She was so fair, that strangers from the sea<br />
Just landed, in the temples thought that she<br />
Was Venus visible to mortal eyes,<br />
New come from Cyprus for a world's surprise.<br />
She was so beautiful that had she stood<br />
On windy Ida by the oaken wood,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>And bared her limbs to that bold shepherd's gaze,<br />
Troy might have stood till now with happy days;<br />
And those three fairest, all have left the land<br />
And left her with the apple in her hand.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Psyche is her name in stories old,</span><br />
As ever by our fathers we were told.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All this beheld Queen Venus from her throne,</span><br />
And felt that she no longer was alone<br />
In beauty, but, if only for a while,<br />
This maiden matched her god-enticing smile;<br />
Therefore, she wrought in such a wise, that she,<br />
If honoured as a goddess, certainly<br />
Was dreaded as a goddess none the less,<br />
And midst her wealth, dwelt long in loneliness.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Two sisters had she, and men deemed them fair,</span><br />
But as King's daughters might be anywhere,<br />
And these to men of name and great estate<br />
Were wedded, while at home must Psyche wait.<br />
The sons of kings before her silver feet<br />
Still bowed, and sighed for her; in measures sweet<br />
The minstrels to the people sung her praise,<br />
Yet must she live a virgin all her days.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So to Apollo's fane her father sent,</span><br />
Seeking to know the dreadful Gods' intent,<br />
And therewith sent he goodly gifts of price<br />
A silken veil, wrought with a paradise,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>Three golden bowls, set round with many a gem,<br />
Three silver robes, with gold in every hem,<br />
And a fair ivory image of the god<br />
That underfoot a golden serpent trod;<br />
And when three lords with these were gone away,<br />
Nor could return until the fortieth day,<br />
Ill was the King at ease, and neither took<br />
Joy in the chase, or in the pictured book<br />
The skilled Athenian limner had just wrought,<br />
Nor in the golden cloths from India brought.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last the day came for those lords' return,</span><br />
And then 'twixt hope and fear the King did burn,<br />
As on his throne with great pomp he was set,<br />
And by him Psyche, knowing not as yet<br />
Why they had gone: thus waiting, at noontide<br />
They in the palace heard a voice outside,<br />
And soon the messengers came hurrying,<br />
And with pale faces knelt before the King,<br />
And rent their clothes, and each man on his head<br />
Cast dust, the while a trembling courtier read<br />
This scroll, wherein the fearful answer lay,<br />
Whereat from every face joy passed away.</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Oracle.</span></h3>

<div class="poem">
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">O</span> <span class="caps">father</span> of a most unhappy maid,</span><br />
O King, whom all the world henceforth shall know<br />
As wretched among wretches, be afraid<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>To ask the gods thy misery to show,<br />
But if thou needs must hear it, to thy woe<br />
Take back thy gifts to feast thine eyes upon,<br />
When thine own flesh and blood some beast hath won.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For hear thy doom, a rugged rock there is</span><br />
Set back a league from thine own palace fair,<br />
There leave the maid, that she may wait the kiss<br />
Of the fell monster that doth harbour there:<br />
This is the mate for whom her yellow hair<br />
And tender limbs have been so fashioned,<br />
This is the pillow for her lovely head.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O what an evil from thy loins shall spring,</span><br />
For all the world this monster overturns,<br />
He is the bane of every mortal thing,<br />
And this world ruined, still for more he yearns;<br />
A fire there goeth from his mouth that burns<br />
Worse than the flame of Phlegethon the red&mdash;<br />
To such a monster shall thy maid be wed.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And if thou sparest now to do this thing,</span><br />
I will destroy thee and thy land also,<br />
And of dead corpses shalt thou be the King,<br />
And stumbling through the dark land shalt thou go,<br />
Howling for second death to end thy woe;<br />
Live therefore as thou mayst and do my will,<br />
And be a King that men may envy still."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What man was there, whose face changed not for grief</span><br />
At hearing this? Psyche, shrunk like the leaf<br />
The autumn frost first touches on the tree,<br />
Stared round about with eyes that could not see,<br />
And muttered sounds from lips that said no word,<br />
And still within her ears the sentence heard<br />
When all was said and silence fell on all<br />
'Twixt marble columns and adorned wall.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then spoke the King, bowed down with misery:</span><br />
"What help is left! O daughter, let us die,<br />
Or else together fleeing from this land,<br />
From town to town go wandering hand in hand<br />
Thou and I, daughter, till all men forget<br />
That ever on a throne I have been set,<br />
And then, when houseless and disconsolate,<br />
We ask an alms before some city gate,<br />
The gods perchance a little gift may give,<br />
And suffer thee and me like beasts to live."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then answered Psyche, through her bitter tears,</span><br />
"Alas! my father, I have known these years<br />
That with some woe the gods have dowered me,<br />
And weighed 'gainst riches infelicity;<br />
Ill is it then against the gods to strive;<br />
Live on, O father, those that are alive<br />
May still be happy; would it profit me<br />
To live awhile, and ere I died to see<br />
Thee perish, and all folk who love me well,<br />
And then at last be dragged myself to hell<br />
Cursed of all men? nay, since all things must die,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>And I have dreamed not of eternity,<br />
Why weepest thou that I must die to-day?<br />
Why weepest thou? cast thought of shame away.<br />
The dead are not ashamed, they feel no pain;<br />
I have heard folk who spoke of death as gain&mdash;<br />
And yet&mdash;ah, God, if I had been some maid,<br />
Toiling all day, and in the night-time laid<br />
Asleep on rushes&mdash;had I only died<br />
Before this sweet life I had fully tried,<br />
Upon that day when for my birth men sung,<br />
And o'er the feasting folk the sweet bells rung."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And therewith she arose and gat away,</span><br />
And in her chamber, mourning long she lay,<br />
Thinking of all the days that might have been,<br />
And how that she was born to be a queen,<br />
The prize of some great conqueror of renown,<br />
The joy of many a country and fair town,<br />
The high desire of every prince and lord,<br />
One who could fright with careless smile or word<br />
The hearts of heroes fearless in the war,<br />
The glory of the world, the leading-star<br />
Unto all honour and all earthly fame&mdash;<br />
&mdash;Round goes the wheel, and death and deadly shame<br />
Shall be her lot, while yet of her men sing<br />
Unwitting that the gods have done this thing.<br />
Long time she lay there, while the sunbeams moved<br />
Over her body through the flowers she loved;<br />
And in the eaves the sparrows chirped outside,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Until for weariness she grew dry-eyed,<br />
And into an unhappy sleep she fell.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But of the luckless King now must we tell,</span><br />
Who sat devising means to 'scape that shame,<br />
Until the frightened people thronging came<br />
About the palace, and drove back the guards,<br />
Making their way past all the gates and wards;<br />
And, putting chamberlains and marshals by,<br />
Surged round the very throne tumultuously.<br />
Then knew the wretched King all folk had heard<br />
The miserable sentence, and the word<br />
The gods had spoken; and from out his seat<br />
He rose, and spoke in humble words, unmeet<br />
For a great King, and prayed them give him grace,<br />
While 'twixt his words the tears ran down his face<br />
On to his raiment stiff with golden thread.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But little heeded they the words he said,</span><br />
For very fear had made them pitiless;<br />
Nor cared they for the maid and her distress,<br />
But clashed their spears together and 'gan cry:<br />
"For one man's daughter shall the people die,<br />
And this fair land become an empty name,<br />
Because thou art afraid to meet the shame<br />
Wherewith the gods reward thy hidden sin?<br />
Nay, by their glory do us right herein!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ye are in haste to have a poor maid slain,"</span><br />
The King said; "but my will herein is vain,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>For ye are many, I one aged man:<br />
Let one man speak, if for his shame he can."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then stepped a sturdy dyer forth, who said,&mdash;</span><br />
"Fear of the gods brings no shame, by my head.<br />
Listen; thy daughter we would have thee leave<br />
Upon the fated mountain this same eve;<br />
And thither must she go right well arrayed<br />
In marriage raiment, loose hair as a maid,<br />
And saffron veil, and with her shall there go<br />
Fair maidens bearing torches, two and two;<br />
And minstrels, in such raiment as is meet<br />
The god-ordain&eacute;d fearful spouse to greet.<br />
So shalt thou save our wives and little ones,<br />
And something better than a heap of stones,<br />
Dwelt in by noisesome things, this town shall be,<br />
And thou thyself shalt keep thy sovereignty;<br />
But if thou wilt not do the thing I say,<br />
Then shalt thou live in bonds from this same day,<br />
And we will bear thy maid unto the hill,<br />
And from the dread gods save the city still."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then loud they shouted at the words he said,</span><br />
And round the head of the unhappy maid,<br />
Dreaming uneasily of long-past joys,<br />
Floated the echo of that dreadful noise,<br />
And changed her dreams to dreams of misery.<br />
But when the King knew that the thing must be,<br />
And that no help there was in this distress,<br />
He bade them have all things in readiness<br />
To take the maiden out at sun-setting,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>And wed her to the unknown dreadful thing.<br />
So through the palace passed with heavy cheer<br />
Her women gathering the sad wedding gear,<br />
Who lingering long, yet at the last must go,<br />
To waken Psyche to her bitter woe.<br />
So coming to her bower, they found her there,<br />
From head to foot rolled in her yellow hair,<br />
As in the saffron veil she should be soon<br />
Betwixt the setting sun and rising moon;<br />
But when above her a pale maiden bent<br />
And touched her, from her heart a sigh she sent,<br />
And waking, on their woeful faces stared,<br />
Sitting upright, with one white shoulder bared<br />
By writhing on the bed in wretchedness.<br />
Then suddenly remembering her distress,<br />
She bowed her head and 'gan to weep and wail<br />
But let them wrap her in the bridal veil,<br />
And bind the sandals to her silver feet,<br />
And set the rose-wreath on her tresses sweet:<br />
But spoke no word, yea, rather, wearily<br />
Turned from the yearning face and pitying eye<br />
Of any maid who seemed about to speak.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now through the garden trees the sun 'gan break,</span><br />
And that inevitable time drew near;<br />
Then through the courts, grown cruel, strange, and drear,<br />
Since the bright morn, they led her to the gate.<br />
Where she beheld a golden litter wait.<br />
Whereby the King stood, aged and bent to earth,<br />
The flute-players with faces void of mirth,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>The down-cast bearers of the ivory wands,<br />
The maiden torch-bearers' unhappy bands.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So then was Psyche taken to the hill,</span><br />
And through the town the streets were void and still;<br />
For in their houses all the people stayed,<br />
Of that most mournful music sore afraid.<br />
But on the way a marvel did they see,<br />
For, passing by, where wrought of ivory,<br />
There stood the Goddess of the flowery isle,<br />
All folk could see the carven image smile.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when anigh the hill's bare top they came,</span><br />
Where Psyche must be left to meet her shame,<br />
They set the litter down, and drew aside<br />
The golden curtains from the wretched bride,<br />
Who at their bidding rose and with them went<br />
Afoot amidst her maids with head down-bent,<br />
Until they came unto the drear rock's brow;<br />
And there she stood apart, not weeping now,<br />
But pale as privet blossom is in June.<br />
There as the quivering flutes left off their tune,<br />
In trembling arms the weeping, haggard King<br />
Caught Psyche, who, like some half-lifeless thing,<br />
Took all his kisses, and no word could say,<br />
Until at last perforce he turned away;<br />
Because the longest agony has end,<br />
And homeward through the twilight did they wend.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Psyche, now faint and bewildered,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>Remembered little of her pain and dread;<br />
Her doom drawn nigh took all her fear away,<br />
And left her faint and weary; as they say<br />
It haps to one who 'neath a lion lies,<br />
Who stunned and helpless feels not ere he dies<br />
The horror of the yellow fell, the red<br />
Hot mouth, and white teeth gleaming o'er his head;<br />
So Psyche felt, as sinking on the ground<br />
She cast one weary vacant look around,<br />
And at the ending of that wretched day<br />
Swooning beneath the risen moon she lay.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span class="big">N</span><span class="caps">ow</span> backward must our story go awhile<br />
And unto Cyprus the fair flowered isle,<br />
Where hid away from every worshipper<br />
Was Venus sitting, and her son by her<br />
Standing to mark what words she had to say,<br />
While in his dreadful wings the wind did play:<br />
Frowning she spoke, in plucking from her thigh<br />
The fragrant flowers that clasped it lovingly.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"In such a town, O son, a maid there is</span><br />
Whom any amorous man this day would kiss<br />

Down on the earth, while unto me one day<br />

And go through all my temples one by one<br />
And look what incense rises unto me;<br />
Hearken the talk of sailors from the sea<br />
Just landed, ever will it be the same,<br />
'Hast thou then seen her?'&mdash;Yea, unto my shame<br />
Within the temple that is call&eacute;d mine,<br />
As through the veil I watched the altar shine<br />
This happed; a man with outstretched hand there stood,<br />
Glittering in arms, of smiling joyous mood,<br />
With crisp, black hair, and such a face one sees<br />
But seldom now, and limbs like Hercules;<br />
But as he stood there in my holy place,<br />
Across mine image came the maiden's face,<br />
And when he saw her, straight the warrior said<br />
Turning about unto an earthly maid,<br />
'O, lady Venus, thou art kind to me<br />
After so much of wandering on the sea<br />
To show thy very body to me here,'<br />
But when this impious saying I did hear,<br />
I sent them a great portent, for straightway<br />
I quenched the fire, and no priest on that day<br />
Could light it any more for all his prayer.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"So must she fall, so must her golden hair</span><br />
Flash no more through the city, or her feet<br />
Be seen like lilies moving down the street;<br />
No more must men watch her soft raiment cling<br />
About her limbs, no more must minstrels sing<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>The praises of her arms and hidden breast.<br />
And thou it is, my son, must give me rest<br />
From all this worship wearisomely paid<br />
Unto a mortal who should be afraid<br />
To match the gods in beauty; take thy bow<br />
And dreadful arrows, and about her sow<br />
The seeds of folly, and with such an one<br />
I pray thee cause her mingle, fair my son,<br />
That not the poorest peasant girl in Greece<br />
Would look on for the gift of Jason's fleece.<br />
Do this, and see thy mother glad again,<br />
And free from insult, in her temples reign<br />
Over the hearts of lovers in the spring."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Mother," he said, "thou askest no great thing,</span><br />
Some wretch too bad for death I soon shall find,<br />
Who round her perfect neck his arms shall wind.<br />
She shall be driven from the palace gate<br />
Where once her crowd of worshippers would wait<br />
From earliest morning till the dew was dry<br />
On chance of seeing her gold gown glancing by;<br />
There through the storm of curses shall she go<br />
In evil raiment midst the winter snow,<br />
Or in the summer in rough sheepskins clad.<br />
And thus, O mother, shall I make thee glad<br />
Remembering all the honour thou hast brought<br />
Unto mine altars; since as thine own thought<br />
My thought is grown, my mind as thy dear mind."<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then straight he rose from earth and down the wind</span><br />
Went glittering 'twixt the blue sky and the sea,<br />
And so unto the place came presently<br />
Where Psyche dwelt, and through the gardens fair<br />
Passed seeking her, and as he wandered there<br />
Had still no thought but to do all her will,<br />
Nor cared to think if it were good or ill:<br />
So beautiful and pitiless he went,<br />
And toward him still the blossomed fruit-trees leant,<br />
And after him the wind crept murmuring,<br />
And on the boughs the birds forgot to sing.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Withal at last amidst a fair green close,</span><br />
Hedged round about with woodbine and red rose,<br />
Within the flicker of a white-thorn shade<br />
In gentle sleep he found the maiden laid<br />
One hand that held a book had fallen away<br />
Across her body, and the other lay<br />
Upon a marble fountain's plashing rim,<br />
Among whose broken waves the fish showed dim,<br />
But yet its wide-flung spray now woke her not,<br />
Because the summer day at noon was hot,<br />
And all sweet sounds and scents were lulling her.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So soon the rustle of his wings 'gan stir</span><br />
Her looser folds of raiment, and the hair<br />
Spread wide upon the grass and daisies fair,<br />
As Love cast down his eyes with a half smile<br />
Godlike and cruel; that faded in a while,<br />
And long he stood above her hidden eyes<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>With red lips parted in a god's surprise.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then very Love knelt down beside the maid</span><br />
And on her breast a hand unfelt he laid,<br />
And drew the gown from off her dainty feet,<br />
And set his fair cheek to her shoulder sweet,<br />
And kissed her lips that knew of no love yet,<br />
And wondered if his heart would e'er forget<br />
The perfect arm that o'er her body lay.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now by chance a damsel came that way,</span><br />
One of her ladies, and saw not the god,<br />
Yet on his shafts cast down had well-nigh trod<br />
In wakening Psyche, who rose up in haste<br />
And girded up her gown about her waist,<br />
And with that maid went drowsily away.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From place to place Love followed her that day</span><br />
And ever fairer to his eyes she grew,<br />
So that at last when from her bower he flew,<br />
And underneath his feet the moonlit sea<br />
Went shepherding his waves disorderly,<br />
He swore that of all gods and men, no one<br />
Should hold her in his arms but he alone;<br />
That she should dwell with him in glorious wise<br />
Like to a goddess in some paradise;<br />
Yea, he would get from Father Jove this grace<br />
That she should never die, but her sweet face<br />
And wonderful fair body should endure<br />
Till the foundations of the mountains sure<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>Were molten in the sea; so utterly<br />
Did he forget his mother's cruelty.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now that he might come to this fair end,</span><br />
He found Apollo, and besought him lend<br />
His throne of divination for a while,<br />
Whereby he did the priestess there beguile,<br />
To give the cruel answer ye have heard<br />
Unto those lords, who wrote it word by word,<br />
And back unto the King its threatenings bore,<br />
Whereof there came that grief and mourning sore,<br />
Of which ye wot; thereby is Psyche laid<br />
Upon the mountain-top; thereby, afraid<br />
Of some ill yet, within the city fair<br />
Cower down the people that have sent her there.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Withal did Love call unto him the Wind</span><br />
Called Zephyrus, who most was to his mind,<br />
And said, "O rainy wooer of the spring,<br />
I pray thee, do for me an easy thing;<br />
To such a hill-top go, O gentle Wind,<br />
And there a sleeping maiden shalt thou find;<br />
Her perfect body in thine arms with care<br />
Take up, and unto the green valley bear<br />
That lies before my noble house of gold;<br />
There leave her lying on the daisies cold."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, smiling, toward the place the fair Wind went</span><br />
While 'neath his wing the sleeping lilies bent,<br />
And flying 'twixt the green earth and the sea<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Made the huge anchored ships dance merrily,<br />
And swung round from the east the gilded vanes<br />
On many a palace, and from unhorsed wains<br />
Twitched off the wheat-straw in his hurried flight;<br />
But ere much time had passed he came in sight<br />
Of Psyche laid in swoon upon the hill,<br />
And smiling, set himself to do Love's will;<br />
For in his arms he took her up with care,<br />
Wondering to see a mortal made so fair,<br />
And came into the vale in little space,<br />
And set her down in the most flowery place;<br />
And then unto the plains of Thessaly<br />
Went ruffling up the edges of the sea.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now underneath the world the moon was gone,</span><br />
But brighter shone the stars so left alone,<br />
Until a faint green light began to show<br />
Far in the east, whereby did all men know,<br />
Who lay awake either with joy or pain,<br />
That day was coming on their heads again;<br />
Then widening, soon it spread to grey twilight,<br />
And in a while with gold the east was bright;<br />
The birds burst out a-singing one by one,<br />
And o'er the hill-top rose the mighty sun.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therewith did Psyche open wide her eyes,</span><br />
And rising on her arm, with great surprise<br />
Gazed on the flowers wherein so deep she lay,<br />
And wondered why upon that dawn of day<br />
Out in the fields she had lift up her head<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>Rather than in her balmy gold-hung bed.<br />
Then, suddenly remembering all her woes,<br />
She sprang upon her feet, and yet arose<br />
Within her heart a mingled hope and dread<br />
Of some new thing: and now she raised her head,<br />
And gazing round about her timidly,<br />
A lovely grassy valley could she see,<br />
That steep grey cliffs upon three sides did bound,<br />
And under these, a river sweeping round,<br />
With gleaming curves the valley did embrace,<br />
And seemed to make an island of that place;<br />
And all about were dotted leafy trees,<br />
The elm for shade, the linden for the bees,<br />
The noble oak, long ready for the steel<br />
Which in that place it had no fear to feel;<br />
The pomegranate, the apple, and the pear,<br />
That fruit and flowers at once made shift to bear,<br />
Nor yet decayed therefor, and in them hung<br />
Bright birds that elsewhere sing not, but here sung<br />
As sweetly as the small brown nightingales<br />
Within the wooded, deep Laconian vales.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But right across the vale, from side to side,</span><br />
A high white wall all further view did hide,<br />
But that above it, vane and pinnacle<br />
Rose up, of some great house beyond to tell,<br />
And still betwixt these, mountains far away<br />
Against the sky rose shadowy, cold, and grey.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She, standing in the yellow morning sun,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>Could scarcely think her happy life was done,<br />
Or that the place was made for misery;<br />
Yea, some lone heaven it rather seemed to be,<br />
Which for the coming band of gods did wait;<br />
Hope touched her heart; no longer desolate,<br />
Deserted of all creatures did she feel,<br />
And o'er her face sweet colour 'gan to steal,<br />
That deepened to a flush, as wandering thought<br />
Desires before unknown unto her brought,<br />
So mighty was the God, though far away.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But trembling midst her hope, she took her way</span><br />
Unto a little door midmost the wall,<br />
And still on odorous flowers her feet did fall,<br />
And round about her did the strange birds sing,<br />
Praising her beauty in their carolling.<br />
Thus coming to the door, when now her hand<br />
First touched the lock, in doubt she needs must stand,<br />
And to herself she said, "Lo, here the trap!<br />
And yet, alas! whatever now may hap,<br />
How can I 'scape the ill which waiteth me?<br />
Let me die now!" and herewith, tremblingly,<br />
She raised the latch, and her sweet sinless eyes<br />
Beheld a garden like a paradise,<br />
Void of mankind, fairer than words can say,<br />
Wherein did joyous harmless creatures play<br />
After their kind, and all amidst the trees<br />
Were strange-wrought founts and wondrous images;<br />
And glimmering 'twixt the boughs could she behold<br />
A house made beautiful with beaten gold,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>Whose open doors in the bright sun did gleam;<br />
Lonely, but not deserted did it seem.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long time she stood debating what to do,</span><br />
But at the last she passed the wicket through,<br />
Which, shutting clamorously behind her, sent<br />
A pang of fear throughout her as she went;<br />
But when through all that green place she had passed<br />
And by the palace porch she stood at last,<br />
And saw how wonderfully the wall was wrought,<br />
With curious stones from far-off countries brought,<br />
And many an image and fair history<br />
Of what the world has been, and yet shall be,<br />
And all set round with golden craftsmanship,<br />
Well-wrought as some renowned cup's royal lip,<br />
She had a thought again to turn aside:<br />
And yet again, not knowing where to bide,<br />
She entered softly, and with trembling hands<br />
Holding her gown; the wonder of all lands<br />
Met there the wonders of the land and sea.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now went she through the chambers tremblingly,</span><br />
And oft in going would she pause and stand,<br />
And drop the gathered raiment from her hand,<br />
Stilling the beating of her heart for fear<br />
As voices whispering low she seemed to hear,<br />
But then again the wind it seemed to be<br />
Moving the golden hangings doubtfully,<br />
Or some bewildered swallow passing close<br />
Unto the pane, or some wind-beaten rose.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon seeing that no evil thing came near,</span><br />
A little she began to lose her fear,<br />
And gaze upon the wonders of the place,<br />
And in the silver mirrors saw her face<br />
Grown strange to her amidst that loneliness,<br />
And stooped to feel the web her feet did press,<br />
Wrought by the brown slim-fingered Indian's toil<br />
Amidst the years of war and vain turmoil;<br />
Or she the figures of the hangings felt,<br />
Or daintily the unknown blossoms smelt,<br />
Or stood and pondered what new thing might mean<br />
The images of knight and king and queen<br />
Wherewith the walls were pictured here and there,<br />
Or touched rich vessels with her fingers fair,<br />
And o'er her delicate smooth cheek would pass<br />
The long-fixed bubbles of strange works of glass:<br />
So wandered she amidst these marvels new<br />
Until anigh the noontide now it grew.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last she came unto a chamber cool</span><br />
Paved cunningly in manner of a pool,<br />
Where red fish seemed to swim through floating weed<br />
And at the first she thought it so indeed,<br />
And took the sandals quickly from her feet,<br />
But when the glassy floor these did but meet<br />
The shadow of a long-forgotten smile<br />
Her anxious face a moment did beguile;<br />
And crossing o'er, she found a table spread<br />
With dainty food, as delicate white bread<br />
And fruits piled up and covered savoury meat,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>As though a king were coming there to eat,<br />
For the worst vessel was of beaten gold.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now when these dainties Psyche did behold</span><br />

She fain had eaten, but did nowise dare,<br />
Thinking she saw a god's feast lying there.<br />
But as she turned to go the way she came<br />
She heard a low soft voice call out her name,<br />
Then she stood still, and trembling gazed around,<br />
And seeing no man, nigh sank upon the ground,<br />
Then through the empty air she heard the voice.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O, lovely one, fear not! rather rejoice</span><br />
That thou art come unto thy sovereignty:<br />
Sit now and eat, this feast is but for thee,<br />
Yea, do whatso thou wilt with all things here,<br />
And in thine own house cast away thy fear,<br />
For all is thine, and little things are these<br />
So loved a heart as thine, awhile to please.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Be patient! thou art loved by such an one</span><br />
As will not leave thee mourning here alone,<br />
But rather cometh on this very night;<br />
And though he needs must hide him from thy sight<br />
Yet all his words of love thou well mayst hear,<br />
And pour thy woes into no careless ear.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Bethink thee then, with what solemnity</span><br />
Thy folk, thy father, did deliver thee<br />
To him who loves thee thus, and void of dread<br />
Remember, sweet, thou art a bride new-wed."<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now hearing this, did Psyche, trembling sore</span><br />
And yet with lighter heart than heretofore,<br />
Sit down and eat, till she grew scarce afeard;<br />
And nothing but the summer noise she heard<br />
Within the garden, then, her meal being done,<br />
Within the window-seat she watched the sun<br />
Changing the garden-shadows, till she grew<br />
Fearless and happy, since she deemed she knew<br />
The worst that could befall, while still the best<br />
Shone a fair star far off: and mid the rest<br />
This brought her after all her grief and fear,<br />
She said, "How sweet it would be, could I hear,<br />
Soft music mate the drowsy afternoon,<br />
And drown awhile the bees' sad murmuring tune<br />
Within these flowering limes." E'en as she spoke,<br />
A sweet-voiced choir of unknown unseen folk<br />
Singing to words that match the sense of these<br />
Hushed the faint music of the linden trees.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Song.</span></h3>
<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">O</span> <span class="caps">pensive,</span> tender maid, downcast and shy,</span><br />
Who turnest pale e'en at the name of love,<br />
And with flushed face must pass the elm-tree by<br />
Ashamed to hear the passionate grey dove<br />
Moan to his mate, thee too the god shall move,<br />
Thee too the maidens shall ungird one day,<br />
And with thy girdle put thy shame away.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What then, and shall white winter ne'er be done</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>Because the glittering frosty morn is fair?<br />
Because against the early-setting sun<br />
Bright show the gilded boughs though waste and bare?<br />
Because the robin singeth free from care?<br />
Ah! these are memories of a better day<br />
When on earth's face the lips of summer lay.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come then, beloved one, for such as thee</span><br />
Love loveth, and their hearts he knoweth well,<br />
Who hoard their moments of felicity,<br />
As misers hoard the medals that they tell,<br />
Lest on the earth but paupers they should dwell:<br />
"We hide our love to bless another day;<br />
The world is hard, youth passes quick," they say.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, little ones, but if ye could forget</span><br />
Amidst your outpoured love that you must die,<br />
Then ye, my servants, were death's conquerors yet,<br />
And love to you should be eternity<br />
How quick soever might the days go by:<br />
Yes, ye are made immortal on the day<br />
Ye cease the dusty grains of time to weigh.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou hearkenest, love? O, make no semblance then</span><br />
That thou art loved, but as thy custom is<br />
Turn thy grey eyes away from eyes of men,<br />
With hands down-dropped, that tremble with thy bliss,<br />
With hidden eyes, take thy first lover's kiss;<br />
Call this eternity which is to-day,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>Nor dream that this our love can pass away.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They ceased, and Psyche pondering o'er their song,</span><br />
Not fearing now that aught would do her wrong,<br />
About the chambers wandered at her will,<br />
And on the many marvels gazed her fill,<br />
Where'er she passed still noting everything,<br />
Then in the gardens heard the new birds sing<br />
And watched the red fish in the fountains play,<br />
And at the very faintest time of day<br />
Upon the grass lay sleeping for a while<br />
Midst heaven-sent dreams of bliss that made her smile;<br />
And when she woke the shades were lengthening,<br />
So to the place where she had heard them sing<br />
She came again, and through a little door<br />
Entered a chamber with a marble floor,<br />
Open a-top unto the outer air,<br />
Beneath which lay a bath of water fair,<br />
Paved with strange stones and figures of bright gold,<br />
And from the steps thereof could she behold<br />
The slim-leaved trees against the evening sky<br />
Golden and calm, still moving languidly.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So for a time upon the brink she sat,</span><br />
Debating in her mind of this and that,<br />
And then arose and slowly from her cast<br />
Her raiment, and adown the steps she passed<br />
Into the water, and therein she played,<br />
Till of herself at last she grew afraid,<br />
And of the broken image of her face,<br />
And the loud splashing in that lonely place.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>So from the bath she gat her quietly,<br />
And clad herself in whatso haste might be;<br />
And when at last she was apparelled<br />
Unto a chamber came, where was a bed<br />
Of gold and ivory, and precious wood<br />
Some island bears where never man has stood;<br />
And round about hung curtains of delight,<br />
Wherein were interwoven Day and Night<br />
Joined by the hands of Love, and round their wings<br />
Knots of fair flowers no earthly May-time brings.<br />
Strange for its beauty was the coverlet,<br />
With birds and beasts and flowers wrought over it;<br />
And every cloth was made in daintier wise<br />
Than any man on earth could well devise:<br />
Yea, there such beauty was in everything,<br />
That she, the daughter of a mighty king,<br />
Felt strange therein, and trembled lest that she,<br />
Deceived by dreams, had wandered heedlessly<br />
Into a bower for some fair goddess made.<br />
Yet if perchance some man had thither strayed,<br />
It had been long ere he had noted aught<br />
But her sweet face, made pensive by the thought<br />
Of all the wonders that she moved in there.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But looking round, upon a table fair</span><br />
She saw a book wherein old tales were writ,<br />
And by the window sat, to read in it<br />
Until the dusk had melted into night,<br />
When waxen tapers did her servants light<br />
With unseen hands, until it grew like day.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so at last upon the bed she lay,</span><br />
And slept a dreamless sleep for weariness,<br />
Forgetting all the wonder and distress.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But at the dead of night she woke, and heard</span><br />
A rustling noise, and grew right sore afeard,<br />
Yea, could not move a finger for affright;<br />
And all was darker now than darkest night.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Withal a voice close by her did she hear.</span><br />
"Alas, my love! why tremblest thou with fear,<br />
While I am trembling with new happiness?<br />
Forgive me, sweet, thy terror and distress:<br />
Not otherwise could this our meeting be.<br />
O loveliest! such bliss awaiteth thee,<br />
For all thy trouble and thy shameful tears.<br />
Such nameless honour, and such happy years,<br />
As fall not unto women of the earth.<br />
Loved as thou art, thy short-lived pains are worth<br />
The glory and the joy unspeakable<br />
Wherein the Treasure of the World shall dwell:<br />
A little hope, a little patience yet,<br />
Ere everything thou wilt, thou may'st forget,<br />
Or else remember as a well-told tale,<br />
That for some pensive pleasure may avail.<br />
Canst thou not love me, then, who wrought thy woe,<br />
That thou the height and depth of joy mightst know?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He spoke, and as upon the bed she lay,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>Trembling amidst new thoughts, he sent a ray<br />
Of finest love unto her inmost heart,<br />
Till, murmuring low, she strove the night to part,<br />
And like a bride who meets her love at last,<br />
When the long days of yearning are o'erpast,<br />
She reached to him her perfect arms unseen,<br />
And said, "O Love, how wretched I have been!<br />
What hast thou done?" And by her side he lay.<br />
Till just before the dawning of the day.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p><span class="big">T</span><span class="caps">he</span> sun was high when Psyche woke again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And turning to the place where he had lain</span><br />
And seeing no one, doubted of the thing<br />
That she had dreamed it, till a fair gold ring,<br />
Unseen before, upon her hand she found,<br />
And touching her bright head she felt it crowned<br />
With a bright circlet; then withal she sighed.<br />
And wondered how the oracle had lied,<br />
And wished her father knew it, and straightway<br />
Rose up and clad herself. Slow went the day,<br />
Though helped with many a solace, till came night;<br />
And therewithal the new, unseen delight,<br />
She learned to call her Love.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">So passed away</span><br />
The days and nights, until upon a day<br />
As in the shade, at noon she lay asleep.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>She dreamed that she beheld her sisters weep,<br />
And her old father clad in sorry guise,<br />
Grown foolish with the weight of miseries,<br />
Her friends black-clad and moving mournfully,<br />
And folk in wonder landed from the sea,<br />
At such a fall of such a matchless maid,<br />
And in some press apart her raiment laid<br />
Like precious relics, and an empty tomb<br />
Set in the palace telling of her doom.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therefore she wept in sleep, and woke with tears</span><br />
Still on her face, and wet hair round her ears,<br />
And went about unhappily that day,<br />
Framing a gentle speech wherewith to pray<br />
For leave to see her sisters once again,<br />
That they might know her happy, and her pain<br />
Turned all to joy, and honour come from shame.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so at last night and her lover came,</span><br />
And midst their fondling, suddenly she said,<br />
"O Love, a little time we have been wed,<br />
And yet I ask a boon of thee this night."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Psyche," he said, "if my heart tells me right,</span><br />
This thy desire may bring us bitter woe,<br />
For who the shifting chance of fate can know?<br />
Yet, forasmuch as mortal hearts are weak,<br />
To-morrow shall my folk thy sisters seek,<br />
And bear them hither; but before the day<br />
Is fully ended must they go away.<br />
And thou&mdash;beware&mdash;for, fresh and good and true,<br />
Thou knowest not what worldly hearts may do,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>Or what a curse gold is unto the earth.<br />
Beware lest from thy full heart, in thy mirth,<br />
Thou tell'st the story of thy love unseen:<br />
Thy loving, simple heart, fits not a queen."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then by her kisses did she know he frowned,</span><br />
But close about him her fair arms she wound,<br />
Until for happiness he 'gan to smile,<br />
And in those arms forgat all else awhile.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So the next day, for joy that they should come,</span><br />
Would Psyche further deck her strange new home,<br />
And even as she 'gan to think the thought,<br />
Quickly her will by unseen hands was wrought,<br />
Who came and went like thoughts. Yea, how should I<br />
Tell of the works of gold and ivory,<br />
The gems and images, those hands brought there<br />
The prisoned things of earth, and sea, and air,<br />
They brought to please their mistress? Many a beast,<br />
Such as King Bacchus in his reckless feast<br />
Makes merry with&mdash;huge elephants, snow-white<br />
With gilded tusks, or dusky-grey with bright<br />
And shining chains about their wrinkled necks;<br />
The mailed rhinoceros, that of nothing recks;<br />
Dusky-maned lions; spotted leopards fair<br />
That through the cane-brake move, unseen as air;<br />
The deep-mouthed tiger, dread of the brown man;<br />
The eagle, and the peacock, and the swan&mdash;<br />
&mdash;These be the nobles of the birds and beasts.<br />
But therewithal, for laughter at their feasts,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>They brought them the gods' jesters, such as be<br />
Quick-chattering apes, that yet in mockery<br />
Of anxious men wrinkle their ugly brows;<br />
Strange birds with pouches, birds with beaks like prows<br />
Of merchant-ships, with tufted crests like threads,<br />
With unimaginable monstrous heads.<br />
Lo, such as these, in many a gilded cage<br />
They brought, or chained for fear of sudden rage.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then strewed they scented branches on the floor,</span><br />
And hung rose-garlands up by the great door,<br />
And wafted incense through the bowers and halls,<br />
And hung up fairer hangings on the walls,<br />
And filled the baths with water fresh and clear,<br />
And in the chambers laid apparel fair,<br />
And spread a table for a royal feast.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then when from all these labours they had ceased,</span><br />
Psyche they sung to sleep with lullabies;<br />
Who slept not long, but opening soon her eyes,<br />
Beheld her sisters on the threshold stand:<br />
Then did she run to take them by the hand,<br />
And laid her cheek to theirs, and murmured words<br />
Of little meaning, like the moan of birds,<br />
While they bewildered stood and gazed around,<br />
Like people who in some strange land have found<br />
One that they thought not of; but she at last<br />
Stood back, and from her face the strayed locks cast,<br />
And, smiling through her tears, said, "Ah, that ye<br />
Should have to weep such useless tears for me!<br />
Alas, the burden that the city bears<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>For nought! O me, my father's burning tears,<br />
That into all this honour I am come!<br />
Nay, does he live yet? Is the ancient home<br />
Still standing? do the galleys throng the quays?<br />
Do the brown Indians glitter down the ways<br />
With rubies as of old? Yes, yes, ye smile,<br />
For ye are thinking, but a little while<br />
Apart from these has she been dwelling here;<br />
Truly, yet long enough, loved ones and dear,<br />
To make me other than I was of old,<br />
Though now when your dear faces I behold<br />
Am I myself again. But by what road<br />
Have ye been brought to this my new abode?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sister," said one, "I rose up from my bed</span><br />
It seems this morn, and being apparell&eacute;d,<br />
And walking in my garden, in a swoon<br />
Helpless and unattended I sank down,<br />
Wherefrom I scarce am waked, for as a dream<br />
Dost thou with all this royal glory seem,<br />
But for thy kisses and thy words, O love."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yea, Psyche," said the other, "as I drove</span><br />
The ivory shuttle through the shuttle-race,<br />
All was changed suddenly, and in this place<br />
I found myself, and standing on my feet,<br />
Where me with sleepy words this one did greet.<br />
Now, sister, tell us whence these wonders come<br />
With all the godlike splendour of your home."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sisters," she said, "more marvels shall ye see</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>When ye, have been a little while with me,<br />
Whereof I cannot tell you more than this<br />
That 'midst them all I dwell in ease and bliss,<br />
Well loved and wedded to a mighty lord,<br />
Fair beyond measure, from whose loving word<br />
I know that happier days await me yet.<br />
But come, my sisters, let us now forget<br />
To seek for empty knowledge; ye shall take<br />
Some little gifts for your lost sister's sake;<br />
And whatso wonders ye may see or hear<br />
Of nothing frightful have ye any fear."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wondering they went with her, and looking round,</span><br />
Each in the other's eyes a strange look found,<br />
For these, her mother's daughters, had no part<br />
In her divine fresh singleness of heart,<br />
But longing to be great, remembered not<br />
How short a time one heart on earth has got.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But keener still that guarded look now grew</span><br />
As more of that strange lovely place they knew,<br />
And as with growing hate, but still afeard,<br />
The unseen choirs' heart-softening strains they heard,<br />
Which did but harden these; and when at noon<br />
They sought the shaded waters' freshening boon,<br />
And all unhidden once again they saw<br />
That peerless beauty, free from any flaw,<br />
Which now at last had won its precious meed,<br />
Her kindness then but fed the fire of greed<br />
Within their hearts&mdash;her gifts, the rich attire<br />
Wherewith she clad them, where like sparks of fire<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>The many-coloured gems shone midst the pearls<br />
The soft silks' winding lines, the work of girls<br />
By the Five Rivers; their fair marvellous crowns,<br />
Their sandals' fastenings worth the rent of towns,<br />
Zones and carved rings, and nameless wonders fair,<br />
All things her faithful slaves had brought them there,<br />
Given amid kisses, made them not more glad;<br />
Since in their hearts the ravening worm they had<br />
That love slays not, nor yet is satisfied<br />
While aught but he has aught; yet still they tried<br />
To look as they deemed loving folk should look,<br />
And still with words of love her bounty took.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So at the last all being apparell&eacute;d,</span><br />
Her sisters to the banquet Psyche led,<br />
Fair were they, and each seemed a glorious queen<br />
With all that wondrous daintiness beseen,<br />
But Psyche clad in gown of dusky blue<br />
Little adorned, with deep grey eyes that knew<br />
The hidden marvels of Love's holy fire,<br />
Seemed like the soul of innocent desire,<br />
Shut from the mocking world, wherefrom those twain<br />
Seemed come to lure her thence with labour vain.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now having reached the place where they should eat,</span><br />
Ere 'neath the canopy the three took seat,<br />
The eldest sister unto Psyche said,<br />
"And he, dear love, the man that thou hast wed,<br />
Will he not wish to-day thy kin to see?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>Then could we tell of thy felicity<br />
The better, to our folk and father dear."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Psyche reddened, "Nay, he is not here,"</span><br />
She stammered, "neither will be here to-day,<br />
For mighty matters keep him far away."<br />
"Alas!" the younger sister said, "Say then,<br />
What is the likeness of this first of men;<br />
What sayest thou about his loving eyne,<br />
Are his locks black, or golden-red as thine?"<br />
"Black-haired like me," said Psyche stammering,<br />
And looking round, "what say I? like the king<br />
Who rules the world, he seems to me at least&mdash;<br />
Come, sisters, sit, and let us make good feast!<br />
My darling and my love ye shall behold<br />
I doubt not soon, his crispy hair of gold,<br />
His eyes unseen; and ye shall hear his voice,<br />
That in my joy ye also may rejoice."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then did they hold their peace, although indeed</span><br />
Her stammering haste they did not fail to heed.<br />
But at their wondrous royal feast they sat<br />
Thinking their thoughts, and spoke of this or that<br />
Between the bursts of music, until when<br />
The sun was leaving the abodes of men;<br />
And then must Psyche to her sisters say<br />
That she was bid, her husband being away,<br />
To suffer none at night to harbour there,<br />
No, not the mother that her body bare<br />
Or father that begat her, therefore they<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>Must leave her now, till some still happier day.<br />
And therewithal more precious gifts she brought<br />
Whereof not e'en in dreams they could have thought<br />
Things whereof noble stories might be told;<br />
And said; "These matters that you here behold<br />
Shall be the worst of gifts that you shall have;<br />
Farewell, farewell! and may the high gods save<br />
Your lives and fame; and tell our father dear<br />
Of all the honour that I live in here,<br />
And how that greater happiness shall come<br />
When I shall reach a long-enduring home."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then these, though burning through the night to stay,</span><br />
Spake loving words, and went upon their way,<br />
When weeping she had kissed them; but they wept<br />
Such tears as traitors do, for as they stepped<br />
Over the threshold, in each other's eyes<br />
They looked, for each was eager to surprise<br />
The envy that their hearts were filled withal,<br />
That to their lips came welling up like gall.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"So," said the first, "this palace without folk,</span><br />
These wonders done with none to strike a stroke.<br />
This singing in the air, and no one seen,<br />
These gifts too wonderful for any queen,<br />
The trance wherein we both were wrapt away,<br />
And set down by her golden house to-day&mdash;<br />
&mdash;These are the deeds of gods, and not of men;<br />
And fortunate the day was to her, when<br />
Weeping she left the house where we were born,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>And all men deemed her shamed and most forlorn."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then said the other, reddening in her rage,</span><br />
"She is the luckiest one of all this age;<br />
And yet she might have told us of her case,<br />
What god it is that dwelleth in the place,<br />
Nor sent us forth like beggars from her gate.<br />
And beggarly, O sister, is our fate,<br />
Whose husbands wring from miserable hinds<br />
What the first battle scatters to the winds;<br />
While she to us whom from her door she drives<br />
And makes of no account or honour, gives<br />
Such wonderful and priceless gifts as these,<br />
Fit to bedeck the limbs of goddesses!<br />
And yet who knows but she may get a fall?<br />
The strongest tower has not the highest wall,<br />
Think well of this, when you sit safe at home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By this unto the river were they come,</span><br />
Where waited Zephyrus unseen, who cast<br />
A languor over them that quickly passed<br />
Into deep sleep, and on the grass they sank;<br />
Then straightway did he lift them from the bank,<br />
And quickly each in her fair house set down,<br />
Then flew aloft above the sleeping town.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long in their homes they brooded over this,</span><br />
And how that Psyche nigh a goddess is;<br />
While all folk deemed that she quite lost had been<br />
For nought they said of all that they had seen.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now that night when she, with many a kiss,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Had told their coming, and of that and this<br />
That happed, he said, "These things, O Love, are well;<br />
Glad am I that no evil thing befell.<br />
And yet, between thy father's house and me<br />
Must thou choose now; then either royally<br />
Shalt thou go home, and wed some king at last,<br />
And have no harm for all that here has passed;<br />
Or else, my love, bear as thy brave heart may,<br />
This loneliness in hope of that fair day,<br />
Which, by my head, shall come to thee; and then<br />
Shalt thou be glorious to the sons of men,<br />
And by my side shalt sit in such estate<br />
That in all time all men shall sing thy fate."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But with that word such love through her he breathed,</span><br />
That round about him her fair arms she wreathed;<br />
And so with loving passed the night away,<br />
And with fresh hope came on the fresh May-day.<br />
And so passed many a day and many a night.<br />
And weariness was balanced with delight,<br />
And into such a mind was Psyche brought,<br />
That little of her father's house she thought,<br />
But ever of the happy day to come<br />
When she should go unto her promised home.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till she that threw the golden apple down</span><br />
Upon the board, and lighted up Troy town,<br />
On dusky wings came flying o'er the place,<br />
And seeing Psyche with her happy face<br />
Asleep beneath some fair tree blossoming,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>Into her sleep straight cast an evil thing;<br />
Whereby she dreamed she saw her father laid<br />
Panting for breath beneath the golden shade<br />
Of his great bed's embroidered canopy,<br />
And with his last breath moaning heavily<br />
Her name and fancied woes; thereat she woke,<br />
And this ill dream through all her quiet broke,<br />
And when next morn her Love from her would go,<br />
And going, as it was his wont to do,<br />
Would kiss her sleeping, he must find the tears<br />
Filling the hollows of her rosy ears<br />
And wetting half the golden hair that lay<br />
Twixt him and her: then did he speak and say,<br />
"O Love, why dost thou lie awake and weep,<br />
Who for content shouldst have good heart to sleep<br />
This cold hour ere the dawning?" Nought she said,<br />
But wept aloud. Then cried he, "By my head!<br />
Whate'er thou wishest I will do for thee;<br />
Yea, if it make an end of thee and me."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O Love," she said, "I scarce dare ask again,</span><br />
Yet is there in mine heart an aching pain<br />
To know what of my father is become:<br />
So would I send my sisters to my home,<br />
Because I doubt indeed they never told<br />
Of all my honour in this house of gold;<br />
And now of them a great oath would I take."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He said, "Alas! and hast thou been awake</span><br />
For them indeed? who in my arms asleep<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>Mightst well have been; for their sakes didst thou weep,<br />
Who mightst have smiled to feel my kiss on thee?<br />
Yet as thou wishest once more shall it be,<br />
Because my oath constrains me, and thy tears.<br />
And yet again beware, and make these fears<br />
Of none avail; nor waver any more,<br />
I pray thee: for already to the shore<br />
Of all delights and joys thou drawest nigh."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He spoke, and from the chamber straight did fly</span><br />
To highest heaven, and going softly then,<br />
Wearied the father of all gods and men<br />
With prayers for Psyche's immortality.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Meantime went Zephyrus across the sea,</span><br />
To bring her sisters to her arms again,<br />
Though of that message little was he fain,<br />
Knowing their malice and their cankered hearts.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For now these two had thought upon their parts</span><br />
And made up a false tale for Psyche's ear;<br />
For when awaked, to her they drew anear,<br />
Sobbing, their faces in their hands they hid,<br />
Nor when she asked them why this thing they did<br />
Would answer aught, till trembling Psyche said,<br />
"Nay, nay, what is it? is our father dead?<br />
Or do ye weep these tears for shame that ye<br />
Have told him not of my felicity,<br />
To make me weep amidst my new-found bliss?<br />
Be comforted, for short the highway is<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>To my forgiveness: this day shall ye go<br />
And take him gifts, and tell him all ye know<br />
Of this my unexpected happy lot."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amidst fresh sobs one said, "We told him not</span><br />
But by good counsel did we hide the thing,<br />
Deeming it well that he should feel the sting<br />
For once, than for awhile be glad again,<br />
And after come to suffer double pain."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Alas! what mean you, sister?" Psyche said,</span><br />
For terror waxing pale as are the dead.<br />
"O sister, speak!" "Child, by this loving kiss,"<br />
Spake one of them, "and that remembered bliss<br />
We dwelt in when our mother was alive,<br />
Or ever we began with ills to strive,<br />
By all the hope thou hast to see again<br />
Our aged father and to soothe his pain,<br />
I charge thee tell me,&mdash;Hast thou seen the thing<br />
Thou callest Husband?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Breathless, quivering,</span><br />
Psyche cried out, "Alas! what sayest thou?<br />
What riddles wilt thou speak unto me now?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Alas!" she said; "then is it as I thought.</span><br />
Sister, in dreadful places have we sought<br />
To learn about thy case, and thus we found<br />
A wise man, dwelling underneath the ground<br />
In a dark awful cave: he told to us<br />
A horrid tale thereof, and piteous,<br />
That thou wert wedded to an evil thing,<br />
A serpent-bodied fiend of poisonous sting,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>Bestial of form, yet therewith lacking not<br />
E'en such a soul as wicked men have got.<br />
Thus ages long agone the gods made him,<br />
And set him in a lake hereby to swim;<br />
But every hundred years he hath this grace,<br />
That he may change within this golden place<br />
Into a fair young man by night alone.<br />
Alas, my sister, thou hast cause to groan!<br />
What sayest thou?&mdash;<i>His words are fair and soft;</i><br />
<i>He raineth loving kisses on me oft,</i><br />
<i>Weeping for love; he tells me of a day</i><br />
<i>When from this place we both shall go away,</i><br />
<i>And he shall kiss me then no more unseen,</i><br />
<i>The while I sit by him a glorious queen</i>&mdash;&mdash;<br />
&mdash;Alas, poor child! it pleaseth thee, his kiss?<br />
Then must I show thee why he doeth this:<br />
Because he willeth for a time to save<br />
Thy body, wretched one! that he may have<br />
Both child and mother for his watery hell&mdash;<br />
Ah, what a tale this is for me to tell!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thou prayest us to save thee, and we can;</span><br />
Since for nought else we sought that wise old man,<br />
Who for great gifts and seeing that of kings<br />
We both were come, has told us all these things,<br />
And given us a fair lamp of hallowed oil<br />
That he has wrought with danger and much toil;<br />
And thereto has he added a sharp knife,<br />
In forging which he well-nigh lost his life,<br />
About him so the devils of the pit<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>Came swarming&mdash;O, my sister, hast thou it?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Straight from her gown the other one drew out</span><br />
The lamp and knife, which Psyche, dumb with doubt<br />
And misery at once, took in her hand.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then said her sister, "From this doubtful land</span><br />
Thou gav'st us royal gifts a while ago,<br />
But these we give thee, though they lack for show,<br />
Shall be to thee a better gift,&mdash;thy life.<br />
Put now in some sure place this lamp and knife,<br />
And when he sleeps rise silently from bed<br />
And hold the hallowed lamp above his head,<br />
And swiftly draw the charm&eacute;d knife across<br />
His cursed neck, thou well may'st bear the loss,<br />
Nor shall he keep his man's shape more, when he<br />
First feels the iron wrought so mysticly:<br />
But thou, flee unto us, we have a tale,<br />
Of what has been thy lot within this vale,<br />
When we have 'scaped therefrom, which we shall do<br />
By virtue of strange spells the old man knew.<br />
Farewell, sweet sister! here we may not stay,<br />
Lest in returning he should pass this way;<br />
But in the vale we will not fail to wait<br />
Till thou art loosened from thine evil fate."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus went they, and for long they said not aught,</span><br />
Fearful lest any should surprise their thought,<br />
But in such wise had envy conquered fear,<br />
That they were fain that eve to bide anear<br />
Their sister's ruined home; but when they came<br />
Unto the river, on them fell the same<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>Resistless languor they had felt before.<br />
And from the blossoms of that flowery shore<br />
Their sleeping bodies soon did Zephyr bear,<br />
For other folk to hatch new ills and care.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But on the ground sat Psyche all alone,</span><br />
The lamp and knife beside her, and no moan<br />
She made, but silent let the long hours go,<br />
Till dark night closed around her and her woe.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then trembling she arose, for now drew near</span><br />
The time of utter loneliness and fear,<br />
And she must think of death, who until now<br />
Had thought of ruined life, and love brought low;<br />
And with, that thought, tormenting doubt there came,<br />
And images of some unheard-of shame,<br />
Until forlorn, entrapped of gods she felt,<br />
As though in some strange hell her spirit dwelt.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet driven by her sisters' words at last,</span><br />
And by remembrance of the time now past,<br />
When she stood trembling, as the oracle<br />
With all its fearful doom upon her fell,<br />
She to her hapless wedding-chamber turned,<br />
And while the waxen tapers freshly burned<br />
She laid those dread gifts ready to her hand,<br />
Then quenched the lights, and by the bed did stand,<br />
Turning these matters in her troubled mind;<br />
And sometimes hoped some glorious man to find<br />
Beneath the lamp, fit bridegroom for a bride<br />
Like her; ah, then! with what joy to his side<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>Would she creep back in the dark silent night;<br />
But whiles she quaked at thought of what a sight<br />
The lamp might show her; the hot rush of blood<br />
The knife might shed upon her as she stood,<br />
The dread of some pursuit, the hurrying out,<br />
Through rooms where every sound would seem a shout<br />
Into the windy night among the trees,<br />
Where many a changing monstrous sight one sees,<br />
When nought at all has happed to chill the blood.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as among these evil thoughts she stood,</span><br />
She heard him coming, and straight crept to bed.<br />
And felt him touch her with a new-born dread,<br />
And durst not answer to his words of love.<br />
But when he slept, she rose that tale to prove.<br />
And sliding down as softly as might be,<br />
And moving through the chamber quietly,<br />
She gat the lamp within her trembling hand,<br />
And long, debating of these things, did stand<br />
In that thick darkness, till she seemed to be<br />
A dweller in some black eternity,<br />
And what she once had called the world did seem<br />
A hollow void, a colourless mad dream;<br />
For she felt so alone&mdash;three times in vain<br />
She moved her heavy hand, three times again<br />
It fell adown; at last throughout the place<br />
Its flame glared, lighting up her woeful face,<br />
Whose eyes the silken carpet did but meet,<br />
Grown strange and awful, and her own wan feet<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>As toward the bed she stole; but come thereto<br />
Back with dosed eyes and quivering lips, she threw<br />
Her lovely head, and strove to think of it,<br />
While images of fearful things did flit<br />
Before her eyes; thus, raising up the hand<br />
That bore the lamp, one moment did she stand<br />
As man's time tells it, and then suddenly<br />
Opened her eyes, but scarce kept back a cry<br />
At what she saw; for there before her lay<br />
The very Love brighter than dawn of day;<br />
And as he lay there smiling, her own name<br />
His gentle lips in sleep began to frame,<br />
And as to touch her face his hand did move;<br />
O then, indeed, her faint heart swelled for love,<br />
And she began to sob, and tears fell fast<br />
Upon the bed.&mdash;But as she turned at last<br />
To quench the lamp, there happed a little thing<br />
That quenched her new delight, for flickering<br />
The treacherous flame cast on his shoulder fair<br />
A burning drop; he woke, and seeing her there<br />
The meaning of that sad sight knew full well,<br />
Nor was there need the piteous tale to tell.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then on her knees she fell with a great cry,</span><br />
For in his face she saw the thunder nigh,<br />
And she began to know what she had done,<br />
And saw herself henceforth, unloved, alone,<br />
Pass onward to the grave; and once again<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>She heard the voice she now must love in vain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ah, has it come to pass? and hast thou lost</span><br />
A life of love, and must thou still be tossed<br />
One moment in the sun 'twixt night and night?<br />
And must I lose what would have been delight,<br />
Untasted yet amidst immortal bliss,<br />
To wed a soul made worthy of my kiss,<br />
Set in a frame so wonderfully made?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O wavering heart, farewell! be not afraid</span><br />
That I with fire will burn thy body fair,<br />
Or cast thy sweet limbs piecemeal through the air;<br />
The fates shall work thy punishment alone,<br />
And thine own memory of our kindness done.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Alas! what wilt thou do? how shalt thou bear</span><br />
The cruel world, the sickening still despair,<br />
The mocking, curious faces bent on thee,<br />
When thou hast known what love there is in me?<br />
O happy only, if thou couldst forget,<br />
And live unholpen, lonely, loveless yet,<br />
But untormented through the little span<br />
That on the earth ye call the life of man.<br />
Alas! that thou, too fair a thing to die,<br />
Shouldst so be born to double misery!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Farewell! though I, a god, can never know</span><br />
How thou canst lose thy pain, yet time will go<br />
Over thine head, and thou mayst mingle yet<br />
The bitter and the sweet, nor quite forget,<br />
Nor quite remember, till these things shall seem<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>The wavering memory of a lovely dream."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therewith he caught his shafts up and his bow,</span><br />
And striding through the chambers did he go,<br />
Light all around him; and she, wailing sore,<br />
Still followed after; but he turned no more,<br />
And when into the moonlit night he came<br />
From out her sight he vanished like a flame,<br />
And on the threshold till the dawn of day<br />
Through all the changes of the night she lay.</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">A</span><span class="caps">t</span> daybreak when she lifted up her eyes,</span><br />
She looked around with heavy dull surprise,<br />
And rose to enter the fair golden place;<br />
But then remembering all her piteous case<br />
She turned away, lamenting very sore,<br />
And wandered down unto the river shore;<br />
There, at the head of a green pool and deep,<br />
She stood so long that she forgot to weep,<br />
And the wild things about the water-side<br />
From such a silent thing cared not to hide;<br />
The dace pushed 'gainst the stream, the dragon-fly,<br />
With its green-painted wing, went flickering by;<br />
The water-hen, the lustred kingfisher,<br />
Went on their ways and took no heed of her;<br />
The little reed birds never ceased to sing,<br />
And still the eddy, like a living thing,<br />
Broke into sudden gurgles at her feet.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>But 'midst these fair things, on that morning sweet,<br />
How could she, weary creature, find a place?<br />
She moved at last, and lifting up her face,<br />
Gathered her raiment up and cried, "Farewell,<br />
O fairest lord! and since I cannot dwell<br />
With thee in heaven, let me now hide my head<br />
In whatsoever dark place dwell the dead!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with that word she leapt into the stream,</span><br />
But the kind river even yet did deem<br />
That she should live, and, with all gentle care,<br />
Cast her ashore within a meadow fair.<br />
Upon the other side, where Shepherd Pan<br />
Sat looking down upon the water wan,<br />
Goat-legged and merry, who called out, "Fair maid<br />
Why goest thou hurrying to the feeble shade<br />
Whence none return? Well do I know thy pain,<br />
For I am old, and have not lived in vain;<br />
Thou wilt forget all that within a while,<br />
And on some other happy youth wilt smile;<br />
And sure he must be dull indeed if he<br />
Forget not all things in his ecstasy<br />
At sight of such a wonder made for him,<br />
That in that clinging gown makes mine eyes swim,<br />
Old as I am: but to the god of Love<br />
Pray now, sweet child, for all things can he move."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Weeping she passed him, but full reverently,</span><br />
And well she saw that she was not to die<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>Till she had filled the measure of her woe.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So through the meads she passed, half blind and slow,</span><br />
And on her sisters somewhat now she thought;<br />
And, pondering on the evil they had wrought,<br />
The veil fell from her, and she saw their guile.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Alas!" she said, "can death make folk so vile?</span><br />
What wonder that the gods are glorious then,<br />
Who cannot feel the hates and fears of men?<br />
Sisters, alas, for what ye used to be!<br />
Once did I think, whatso might hap to me,<br />
Still at the worst, within your arms to find<br />
A haven of pure love; then were ye kind,<br />
Then was your joy e'en as my very own&mdash;<br />
And now, and now, if I can be alone<br />

That is my best: but that can never be,<br />
For your unkindness still shall stay with me<br />
When ye are dead&mdash;But thou, my love! my dear!<br />
Wert thou not kind?&mdash;I should have lost my fear<br />
Within a little&mdash;Yea, and e'en just now<br />
With angry godhead on thy lovely brow,<br />
Still thou wert kind&mdash;And art thou gone away<br />
For ever? I know not, but day by day<br />
Still will I seek thee till I come to die,<br />
And nurse remembrance of felicity<br />
Within my heart, although it wound me sore;<br />
For what am I but thine for evermore!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thenceforth her back upon the world she turned</span><br />
As she had known it; in her heart there burned<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>Such deathless love, that still untired she went:<br />
The huntsman dropping down the woody bent,<br />
In the still evening, saw her passing by,<br />
And for her beauty fain would draw anigh,<br />
But yet durst not; the shepherd on the down<br />
Wondering, would shade his eyes with fingers brown,<br />
As on the hill's brow, looking o'er the lands,<br />
She stood with straining eyes and clinging hands,<br />
While the wind blew the raiment from her feet;<br />
The wandering soldier her grey eyes would meet,<br />
That took no heed of him, and drop his own;<br />
Like a thin dream she passed the clattering town;<br />
On the thronged quays she watched the ships come in<br />
Patient, amid the strange outlandish din;<br />
Unscared she saw the sacked towns' miseries,<br />
And marching armies passed before her eyes.<br />
And still of her the god had such a care<br />
That none might wrong her, though alone and fair.<br />
Through rough and smooth she wandered many a day,<br />
Till all her hope had well-nigh passed away.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Meanwhile the sisters, each in her own home,</span><br />
Waited the day when outcast she should come<br />
And ask their pity; when perchance, indeed,<br />
They looked to give her shelter in her need,<br />
And with soft words such faint reproaches take<br />
As she durst make them for her ruin's sake;<br />
But day passed day, and still no Psyche came,<br />
And while they wondered whether, to their shame,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>Their plot had failed, or gained its end too well,<br />
And Psyche slain, no tale thereof could tell.&mdash;<br />
Amidst these things, the eldest sister lay<br />
Asleep one evening of a summer day,<br />
Dreaming she saw the god of Love anigh,<br />
Who seemed to say unto her lovingly,<br />
"Hail unto thee, fair sister of my love;<br />
Nor fear me for that thou her faith didst prove,<br />
And found it wanting, for thou, too, art fair,<br />
Nor is her place filled; rise, and have no care<br />
For father or for friends, but go straightway<br />
Unto the rock where she was borne that day;<br />
There, if thou hast a will to be my bride,<br />
Put thou all fear of horrid death aside,<br />
And leap from off the cliff, and there will come<br />
My slaves, to bear thee up and take thee home.<br />
Haste then, before the summer night grows late,<br />
For in my house thy beauty I await!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So spake the dream; and through the night did sail,</span><br />
And to the other sister bore the tale,<br />
While this one rose, nor doubted of the thing,<br />
Such deadly pride unto her heart did cling;<br />
But by the tapers' light triumphantly,<br />
Smiling, her mirrored body did she eye,<br />
Then hastily rich raiment on her cast<br />
And through the sleeping serving-people passed,<br />
And looked with changed eyes on the moonlit street,<br />
Nor scarce could feel the ground beneath her feet.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>But long the time seemed to her, till she came<br />
There where her sister once was borne to shame;<br />
And when she reached the bare cliff's rugged brow<br />
She cried aloud, "O Love, receive me now,<br />
Who am not all unworthy to be thine!"<br />
And with that word, her jewelled arms did shine<br />
Outstretched beneath the moon, and with one breath<br />
She sprung to meet the outstretched arms of Death,<br />
The only god that waited for her there,<br />
And in a gathered moment of despair<br />
A hideous thing her traitrous life did seem.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But with the passing of that hollow dream</span><br />
The other sister rose, and as she might,<br />
Arrayed herself alone in that still night,<br />
And so stole forth, and making no delay<br />
Came to the rock anigh the dawn of day;<br />
No warning there her sister's spirit gave,<br />
No doubt came nigh the fore-doomed soul to save,<br />
But with a fever burning in her blood,<br />
With glittering eyes and crimson cheeks she stood<br />
One moment on the brow, the while she cried,<br />
"Receive me, Love, chosen to be thy bride<br />
From all the million women of the world!"<br />
Then o'er the cliff her wicked limbs were hurled,<br />
Nor has the language of the earth a name<br />
For that surprise of terror and of shame.</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">N</span><span class="caps">ow,</span> midst her wanderings, on a hot noontide,</span><br />
Psyche passed down a road, where, on each side<br />
The yellow cornfields lay, although as yet<br />
Unto the stalks no sickle had been set;<br />
The lark sung over them, the butterfly<br />
Flickered from ear to ear distractedly,<br />
The kestrel hung above, the weasel peered<br />
From out the wheat-stalks on her unafeard,<br />
Along the road the trembling poppies shed<br />
On the burnt grass their crumpled leaves and red;<br />
Most lonely was it, nothing Psyche knew<br />
Unto what land of all the world she drew;<br />
Aweary was she, faint and sick at heart,<br />
Bowed to the earth by thoughts of that sad part<br />
She needs must play: some blue flower from the corn<br />
That in her fingers erewhile she had borne,<br />
Now dropped from them, still clung unto her gown;<br />
Over the hard way hung her head adown<br />
Despairingly, but still her weary feet<br />
Moved on half conscious, her lost love to meet.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So going, at the last she raised her eyes,</span><br />
And saw a grassy mound before her rise<br />
Over the yellow plain, and thereon was<br />
A marble fane with doors of burnished brass,<br />
That 'twixt the pillars set about it burned;<br />
So thitherward from off the road she turned,<br />
And soon she heard a rippling water sound,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>And reached a stream that girt the hill around,<br />
Whose green waves wooed her body lovingly;<br />
So looking round, and seeing no soul anigh,<br />
Unclad, she crossed the shallows, and there laid<br />
Her dusty raiment in the alder-shade,<br />
And slipped adown into the shaded pool,<br />
And with the pleasure of the water cool<br />
Soothed her tired limbs awhile, then with a sigh<br />
Came forth, and clad her body hastily,<br />
And up the hill made for the little fane.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when its threshold now her feet did gain,</span><br />
She, looking through the pillars of the shrine,<br />
Beheld therein a golden image shine<br />
Of golden Ceres; then she passed the door,<br />
And with bowed head she stood awhile before<br />
The smiling image, striving for some word<br />
That did not name her lover and her lord,<br />
Until midst rising tears at last she prayed:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O kind one, if while yet I was a maid</span><br />
I ever did thee pleasure, on this day<br />
Be kind to me, poor wanderer on the way,<br />
Who strive my love upon the earth to meet!<br />
Then let me rest my weary, doubtful feet<br />
Within thy quiet house a little while,<br />
And on my rest if thou wouldst please to smile,<br />
And send me news of my own love and lord,<br />
It would not cost thee, lady, many a word."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But straight from out the shrine a sweet voice came,</span><br />
"O Psyche, though of me thou hast no blame,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>And though indeed thou sparedst not to give<br />
What my soul loved, while happy thou didst live,<br />
Yet little can I give now unto thee,<br />
Since thou art rebel, slave, and enemy<br />
Unto the love-inspiring Queen; this grace<br />
Thou hast alone of me, to leave this place<br />
Free as thou camest, though the lovely one<br />
Seeks for the sorceress who entrapped her son<br />
In every land, and has small joy in aught,<br />
Until before her presence thou art brought."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Psyche, trembling at the words she spake,</span><br />
Durst answer nought, nor for that counsel's sake<br />
Could other offerings leave except her tears,<br />
As now, tormented by the new-born fears<br />
The words divine had raised in her, she passed<br />
The brazen threshold once again, and cast<br />
A dreary hopeless look across the plain,<br />
Whose golden beauty now seemed nought and vain<br />
Unto her aching heart; then down the hill<br />
She went, and crossed the shallows of the rill,<br />
And wearily she went upon her way,<br />
Nor any homestead passed upon that day,<br />
Nor any hamlet, and at night lay down<br />
Within a wood, far off from any town.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There, waking at the dawn, did she behold,</span><br />
Through the green leaves, a glimmer as of gold,<br />
And, passing on, amidst an oak-grove found<br />
A pillared temple gold-adorned and round,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>Whose walls were hung with rich and precious things,<br />
Worthy to be the ransom of great kings;<br />
And in the midst of gold and ivory<br />
An image of Queen Juno did she see;<br />
Then her heart swelled within her, and she thought,<br />
"Surely the gods hereto my steps have brought,<br />
And they will yet be merciful and give<br />
Some little joy to me, that I may live<br />
Till my Love finds me." Then upon her knees<br />
She fell, and prayed, "O Crown of goddesses,<br />
I pray thee, give me shelter in this place,<br />
Nor turn away from me thy much-loved face,<br />
If ever I gave golden gifts to thee<br />
In happier times when my right hand was free."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then from the inmost shrine there came a voice</span><br />
That said, "It is so, well mayst thou rejoice<br />
That of thy gifts I yet have memory,<br />
Wherefore mayst thou depart forewarned and free;<br />
Since she that won the golden apple lives,<br />
And to her servants mighty gifts now gives<br />
To find thee out, in whatso land thou art,<br />
For thine undoing; loiter not, depart!<br />
For what immortal yet shall shelter thee<br />
From her that rose from out the unquiet sea?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Psyche moaned out in her grief and fear,</span><br />
"Alas! and is there shelter anywhere<br />
Upon the green flame-hiding earth?" said she,<br />
"Or yet beneath it is there peace for me?<br />
O Love, since in thine arms I cannot rest,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>Or lay my weary head upon thy breast,<br />
Have pity yet upon thy love forlorn,<br />
Make me as though I never had been born!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then wearily she went upon her way,</span><br />
And so, about the middle of the day,<br />
She came before a green and flowery place,<br />
Walled round about in manner of a chase,<br />
Whereof the gates as now were open wide;<br />
Fair grassy glades and long she saw inside<br />
Betwixt great trees, down which the unscared deer<br />
Were playing; yet a pang of deadly fear,<br />
She knew not why, shot coldly through her heart,<br />
And thrice she turned as though she would depart,<br />
And thrice returned, and in the gateway stood<br />
With wavering feet: small flowers as red as blood<br />
Were growing up amid the soft green grass,<br />
And here and there a fallen rose there was,<br />
And on the trodden grass a silken lace,<br />
As though crowned revellers had passed by the place<br />
The restless sparrows chirped upon the wall<br />
And faint far music on her ears did fall,<br />
And from the trees within, the pink-foot doves<br />
Still told their weary tale unto their loves,<br />
And all seemed peaceful more than words could say.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then she, whose heart still whispered, "Keep away."</span><br />
Was drawn by strong desire unto the place,<br />
So toward the greenest glade she set her face,<br />
Murmuring, "Alas! and what a wretch am I,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>That I should fear the summer's greenery!<br />
Yea, and is death now any more an ill,<br />
When lonely through the world I wander still."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when she was amidst those ancient groves,</span><br />
Whose close green leaves and choirs of moaning doves<br />
Shut out the world, then so alone she seemed,<br />
So strange, her former life was but as dreamed;<br />
Beside the hopes and fears that drew her on,<br />
Till so far through that green place she had won,<br />
That she a rose-hedged garden could behold<br />
Before a house made beautiful with gold;<br />
Which, to her mind beset with that past dream,<br />
And dim foreshadowings of ill fate, did seem<br />
That very house, her joy and misery,<br />
Where that fair sight her longing eyes did see<br />
They should not see again; but now the sound<br />
Of pensive music echoing all around,<br />
Made all things like a picture, and from thence<br />
Bewildering odours floating, dulled her sense,<br />
And killed her fear, and, urged by strong desire<br />
To see how all should end, she drew yet nigher,<br />
And o'er the hedge beheld the heads of girls<br />
Embraced by garlands fresh and orient pearls,<br />
And heard sweet voices murmuring; then a thrill<br />
Of utmost joy all memory seemed to kill<br />
Of good or evil, and her eager hand<br />
Was on the wicket, then her feet did stand<br />
Upon new flowers, the while her dizzied eyes<br />
Gazed wildly round on half-seen mysteries,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>And wandered from unnoting face to face.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For round a fountain midst the flowery place</span><br />
Did she behold full many a minstrel girl;<br />
While nigh them, on the grass in giddy whirl,<br />
Bright raiment and white limbs and sandalled feet<br />
Flew round in time unto the music sweet,<br />
Whose strains no more were pensive now nor sad,<br />
But rather a fresh sound of triumph had;<br />
And round the dance were gathered damsels fair,<br />
Clad in rich robes adorned with jewels rare;<br />
Or little hidden by some woven mist,<br />
That, hanging round them, here a bosom kissed<br />
And there a knee, or driven by the wind<br />
About some lily's bowing stem was twined.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when a little Psyche's eyes grew clear,</span><br />
A sight they saw that brought back all her fear<br />
A hundred-fold, though neither heaven nor earth<br />
To such a fair sight elsewhere could give birth;<br />
Because apart, upon a golden throne<br />
Of marvellous work, a woman sat alone,<br />
Watching the dancers with a smiling face,<br />
Whose beauty sole had lighted up the place.<br />
A crown there was upon her glorious head,<br />
A garland round about her girdlestead,<br />
Where matchless wonders of the hidden sea<br />
Were brought together and set wonderfully;<br />
Naked she was of all else, but her hair<br />
About her body rippled here and there,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>And lay in heaps upon the golden seat,<br />
And even touched the gold cloth where her feet<br />
Lay amid roses&mdash;ah, how kind she seemed!<br />
What depths of love from out her grey eyes beamed!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well might the birds leave singing on the trees</span><br />
To watch in peace that crown of goddesses,<br />
Yet well might Psyche sicken at the sight,<br />
And feel her feet wax heavy, her head light;<br />
For now at last her evil day was come,<br />
Since she had wandered to the very home<br />
Of her most bitter cruel enemy.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Half-dead, yet must she turn about to flee,</span><br />
But as her eyes back o'er her shoulder gazed,<br />
And with weak hands her clinging gown she raised,<br />
And from her lips unwitting came a moan,<br />
She felt strong arms about her body thrown,<br />
And, blind with fear, was haled along till she<br />
Saw floating by her faint eyes dizzily<br />
That vision of the pearls and roses fresh,<br />
The golden carpet and the rosy flesh.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, as in vain she strove to make some sound,</span><br />
A sweet voice seemed to pierce the air around<br />
With bitter words; her doom rang in her ears,<br />
She felt the misery that lacketh tears.<br />
"Come hither, damsels, and the pearl behold<br />
That hath no price? See now the thrice-tried gold,<br />
That all men worshipped, that a god would have<br />
To be his bride! how like a wretched slave<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>She cowers down, and lacketh even voice<br />
To plead her cause! Come, damsels, and rejoice,<br />
That now once more the waiting world will move,<br />
Since she is found, the well-loved soul of love!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And thou poor wretch, what god hath led thee here?</span><br />
Art thou so lost in this abyss of fear,<br />
Thou canst not weep thy misery and shame?<br />
Canst thou not even speak thy shameful name?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But even then the flame of fervent love</span><br />
In Psyche's tortured heart began to move,<br />
And gave her utterance, and she said, "Alas!<br />
Surely the end of life has come to pass<br />
For me, who have been bride of very Love,<br />
Yet love still bides in me, O Seed of Jove,<br />
For such I know thee; slay me, nought is lost!<br />
For had I had the will to count the cost<br />
And buy my love with all this misery,<br />
Thus and no otherwise the thing should be.<br />
Would I were dead, my wretched beauty gone,<br />
No trouble now to thee or any one!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with that last word did she hang her head,</span><br />
As one who hears not, whatsoe'er is said;<br />
But Venus rising with a dreadful cry<br />
Said, "O thou fool, I will not let thee die!<br />
But thou shalt reap the harvest thou hast sown<br />
And many a day thy wretched lot bemoan.<br />
Thou art my slave, and not a day shall be<br />
But I will find some fitting task for thee,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>Nor will I slay thee till thou hop'st again.<br />
What, thinkest thou that utterly in vain<br />
Jove is my sire, and in despite my will<br />
That thou canst mock me with thy beauty still?<br />
Come forth, O strong-armed, punish this new slave,<br />
That she henceforth a humble heart may have."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All round about the damsels in a ring</span><br />
Were drawn to see the ending of the thing,<br />
And now as Psyche's eyes stared wildly round<br />
No help in any face of them she found<br />
As from the fair and dreadful face she turned<br />
In whose grey eyes such steadfast anger burned;<br />
Yet midst her agony she scarcely knew<br />

What thing it was the goddess bade them do,<br />
And all the pageant, like a dreadful dream<br />
Hopeless and long-enduring grew to seem;<br />
Yea, when the strong-armed through the crowd did break,<br />
Girls like to those, whose close-locked squadron shake<br />
The echoing surface of the Asian plain,<br />
And when she saw their threatening hands, in vain<br />
She strove to speak, so like a dream it was;<br />
So like a dream that this should come to pass,<br />
And 'neath her feet the green earth opened not.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when her breaking heart again waxed hot</span><br />
With dreadful thoughts and prayers unspeakable<br />
As all their bitter torment on her fell,<br />
When she her own voice heard, nor knew its sound,<br />
And like red flame she saw the trees and ground,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>Then first she seemed to know what misery<br />
To helpless folk upon the earth can be.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But while beneath the many moving feet</span><br />
The small crushed flowers sent up their odour sweet,<br />
Above sat Venus, calm, and very fair,<br />
Her white limbs bared of all her golden hair,<br />
Into her heart all wrath cast back again,<br />
As on the terror and the helpless pain<br />
She gazed with gentle eyes, and unmoved smile;<br />
Such as in Cyprus, the fair blossomed isle,<br />
When on the altar in the summer night<br />
They pile the roses up for her delight,<br />
Men see within their hearts, and long that they<br />
Unto her very body there might pray.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last to them some dainty sign she made</span><br />
To hold their cruel hands, and therewith bade<br />
To bear her slave new gained from out her sight<br />
And keep her safely till the morrow's light:<br />
So her across the sunny sward they led<br />
With fainting limbs, and heavy downcast head,<br />
And into some nigh lightless prison cast<br />
To brood alone o'er happy days long past<br />
And all the dreadful times that yet should be.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But she being gone, one moment pensively</span><br />
The goddess did the distant hills behold,<br />
Then bade her girls bind up her hair of gold,<br />
And veil her breast, the very forge of love,<br />
With raiment that no earthly shuttle wove,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>And 'gainst the hard earth arm her lovely feet:<br />
Then she went forth, some shepherd king to meet<br />
Deep in the hollow of a shaded vale,<br />
To make his woes a long-enduring tale.</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">B</span><span class="caps">ut</span> over Psyche, hapless and forlorn,</span><br />
Unseen the sun rose on the morrow morn,<br />
Nor knew she aught about the death of night<br />
Until her gaoler's torches filled with light<br />
The dreary place, blinding her unused eyes,<br />
And she their voices heard that bade her rise;<br />
She did their bidding, yet grown faint and pale<br />
She shrank away and strove her arms to veil<br />
In her gown's bosom, and to hide from them<br />
Her little feet within her garment's hem;<br />
But mocking her, they brought her thence away,<br />
And led her forth into the light of day,<br />
And brought her to a marble cloister fair<br />
Where sat the queen on her adorn&eacute;d chair,<br />
But she, as down the sun-streaked place they came,<br />
Cried out, "Haste! ye, who lead my grief and shame."<br />
And when she stood before her trembling, said,<br />
"Although within a palace thou wast bred<br />
Yet dost thou carry but a slavish heart,<br />
And fitting is it thou shouldst learn thy part,<br />
And know the state whereunto thou art brought;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>Now, heed what yesterday thy folly taught,<br />
And set thyself to-day my will to do;<br />
Ho ye, bring that which I commanded you."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then forth came two, and each upon her back</span><br />
Bore up with pain a huge half-bursten sack,<br />
Which, setting down, they opened on the floor,<br />
And from their hempen mouths a stream did pour<br />
Of mingled seeds, and grain, peas, pulse, and wheat,<br />
Poppies and millet, and coriander sweet,<br />
And many another brought from far-off lands,<br />
Which mingling more with swift and ready hands<br />
They piled into a heap confused and great.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then said Venus, rising from her seat,</span><br />
"Slave, here I leave thee, but before the night<br />
These mingled seeds thy hands shall set aright,<br />
All laid in heaps, each after its own kind,<br />
And if in any heap I chance to find<br />
An alien seed; thou knowest since yesterday<br />
How disobedient slaves the forfeit pay."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therewith she turned and left the palace fair</span><br />
And from its outskirts rose into the air,<br />
And flew until beneath her lay the sea,<br />
Then, looking on its green waves lovingly,<br />
Somewhat she dropped, and low adown she flew<br />
Until she reached the temple that she knew<br />
Within a sunny bay of her fair isle.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Psyche sadly labouring all the while</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>With hopeless heart felt the swift hours go by,<br />
And knowing well what bitter mockery<br />
Lay in that task, yet did she what she might<br />
That something should be finished ere the night,<br />
And she a little mercy yet might ask;<br />
But the first hours of that long feverish task<br />
Passed amid mocks; for oft the damsels came<br />
About her, and made merry with her shame,<br />
And laughed to see her trembling eagerness,<br />
And how, with some small lappet of her dress,<br />
She winnowed out the wheat, and how she bent<br />
Over the millet, hopelessly intent;<br />
And how she guarded well some tiny heap<br />
But just begun, from their long raiments' sweep;<br />
And how herself, with girt gown, carefully<br />
She went betwixt the heaps that 'gan to lie<br />
Along the floor; though they were small enow,<br />
When shadows lengthened and the sun was low;<br />
But at the last these left her labouring,<br />
Not daring now to weep, lest some small thing<br />
Should 'scape her blinded eyes, and soon far off<br />
She heard the echoes of their careless scoff.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Longer the shades grew, quicker sank the sun,</span><br />
Until at last the day was well-nigh done,<br />
And every minute did she think to hear<br />
The fair Queen's dreaded footsteps drawing near;<br />
But Love, that moves the earth, and skies, and sea,<br />
Beheld his old love in her misery,<br />
And wrapped her heart in sudden gentle sleep;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>And meanwhile caused unnumbered ants to creep<br />
About her, and they wrought so busily<br />
That all, ere sundown, was as it should be,<br />
And homeward went again the kingless folk.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bewildered with her joy again she woke,</span><br />
But scarce had time the unseen hands to bless,<br />
That thus had helped her utter feebleness,<br />
Ere Venus came, fresh from the watery way,<br />
Panting with all the pleasure of the day;<br />
But when she saw the ordered heaps, her smile<br />
Faded away, she cried out, "Base and vile<br />
Thou art indeed, this labour fitteth thee;<br />
But now I know thy feigned simplicity,<br />
Thine inward cunning, therefore hope no more,<br />
Since thou art furnished well with hidden lore,<br />
To 'scape thy due reward, if any day<br />
Without some task accomplished, pass away!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So with a frown she passed on, muttering,</span><br />
"Nought have I done, to-morrow a new thing."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So the next morning Psyche did they lead</span><br />
Unto a terrace o'er a flowery mead,<br />
Where Venus sat, hid from the young sun's rays,<br />
Upon the fairest of all summer days;<br />
She pointed o'er the meads as they drew nigh,<br />
And said, "See how that stream goes glittering by,<br />
And on its banks my golden sheep now pass,<br />
Cropping sweet mouthfuls of the flowery grass;<br />
If thou, O cunning slave, to-day art fain<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>To save thyself from well-remembered pain,<br />
Put forth a little of thy hidden skill,<br />
And with their golden fleece thy bosom fill;<br />
Yet make no haste, but ere the sun is down<br />
Cast it before my feet from out thy gown;<br />
Surely thy labour is but light to-day."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then sadly went poor Psyche on her way,</span><br />
Wondering wherein the snare lay, for she knew<br />
No easy thing it was she had to do;<br />
Nor had she failed indeed to note the smile<br />
Wherewith the goddess praised her for the guile<br />
That she, unhappy, lacked so utterly.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amidst these thoughts she crossed the flowery lea,</span><br />
And came unto the glittering river's side;<br />
And, seeing it was neither deep nor wide,<br />
She drew her sandals off, and to the knee<br />
Girt up her gown, and by a willow-tree<br />
Went down into the water, and but sank<br />
Up to mid-leg therein; but from the bank<br />
She scarce had gone three steps, before a voice<br />
Called out to her, "Stay, Psyche, and rejoice<br />
That I am here to help thee, a poor reed,<br />
The soother of the loving hearts that bleed,<br />
The pourer forth of notes, that oft have made<br />
The weak man strong, and the rash man afraid.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sweet child, when by me now thy dear foot trod,</span><br />
I knew thee for the loved one of our god;<br />
Then prithee take my counsel in good part;<br />
Go to the shore again, and rest thine heart<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>In sleep awhile, until the sun get low,<br />
And then across the river shalt thou go<br />
And find these evil creatures sleeping fast,<br />
And on the bushes whereby they have passed<br />
Much golden wool; take what seems good to thee,<br />
And ere the sun sets go back easily.<br />
But if within that mead thou sett'st thy feet<br />
While yet they wake, an ill death shalt thou meet,<br />
For they are of a cursed man-hating race,<br />
Bred by a giant in a lightless place."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But at these words soft tears filled Psyche's eyes</span><br />
As hope of love within her heart did rise;<br />
And when she saw she was not helpless yet<br />
Her old desire she would not quite forget;<br />
But turning back, upon the bank she lay<br />
In happy dreams till nigh the end of day;<br />
Then did she cross and gather of the wool,<br />
And with her bosom and her gown-skirt full<br />
Came back to Venus at the sun-setting;<br />
But she afar off saw it glistering<br />
And cried aloud, "Go, take the slave away,<br />
And keep her safe for yet another day,<br />
And on the morning will I think again<br />
Of some fresh task, since with so little pain<br />
She doeth what the gods find hard enow;<br />
For since the winds were pleased this waif to blow<br />
Unto my door, a fool I were indeed,<br />
If I should fail to use her for my need."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So her they led away from that bright sun,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>Now scarce more hopeful that the task was done,<br />
Since by those bitter words she knew full well<br />
Another tale the coming day would tell.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the next morn upon a turret high,</span><br />
Where the wind kissed her raiment lovingly,<br />
Stood Venus waiting her; and when she came<br />
She said, "O slave, thy city's very shame,<br />
Lift up thy cunning eyes, and looking hence<br />
Shalt thou behold betwixt these battlements,<br />
A black and barren mountain set aloof<br />
From the green hills, shaped like a palace roof.<br />
Ten leagues from hence it lieth, toward the north,<br />
And from its rocks a fountain welleth forth,<br />
Black like itself, and floweth down its side,<br />
And in a while part into Styx doth glide,<br />
And part into Cocytus runs away,<br />
Now coming thither by the end of day,<br />
Fill me this ewer from out the awful stream;<br />
Such task a sorceress like thee will deem<br />
A little matter; bring it not to pass,<br />
And if thou be not made of steel or brass,<br />
To-morrow shalt thou find the bitterest day<br />
Thou yet hast known, and all be sport and play<br />
To what thy heart in that hour shall endure&mdash;<br />
Behold, I swear it, and my word is sure!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She turned therewith to go down toward the sea,</span><br />
To meet her lover, who from Thessaly<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>Was come from some well-foughten field of war.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Psyche, wandering wearily afar,</span><br />
Reached the bare foot of that black rock at last,<br />
And sat there grieving for the happy past,<br />
For surely now, she thought, no help could be,<br />
She had but reached the final misery,<br />
Nor had she any counsel but to weep.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For not alone the place was very steep,</span><br />
And craggy beyond measure, but she knew<br />
What well it was that she was driven to,<br />
The dreadful water that the gods swear by,<br />
For there on either hand, as one draws nigh,<br />
Are long-necked dragons ready for the spring,<br />
And many another monstrous nameless thing,<br />
The very sight of which is well-nigh death;<br />
Then the black water as it goes crieth,<br />
"Fly, wretched one, before you come to die!<br />
Die, wretched man! I will not let you fly!<br />
How have you heart to come before me here?<br />
You have no heart, your life is turned to fear!"<br />
Till the wretch falls adown with whirling brain,<br />
And far below the sharp rocks end his pain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well then might Psyche wail her wretched fate,</span><br />
And strive no more, but sitting weep and wait<br />
Alone in that black land for kindly death,<br />
With weary sobbing, wasting life and breath;<br />
But o'er her head there flew the bird of Jove,<br />
The bearer of his servant, friend of Love,<br />
Who, when he saw her, straightway towards her flew,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>And asked her why she wept, and when he knew,<br />
And who she was, he said, "Cease all thy fear,<br />
For to the black waves I thy ewer will bear,<br />
And fill it for thee; but, remember me,<br />
When thou art come unto thy majesty."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then straight he flew, and through the dragon's wings</span><br />
Went carelessly, nor feared their clatterings,<br />
But set the ewer, filled, in her right hand,<br />
And on that day saw many another land.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Psyche through the night toiled back again,</span><br />
And as she went, she thought, "Ah! all is vain,<br />
For though once more I just escape indeed,<br />
Yet hath she many another wile at need;<br />
And to these days when I my life first learn,<br />
With unavailing longing shall I turn,<br />
When this that seemeth now so horrible<br />
Shall then seem but the threshold of her hell.<br />
Alas! what shall I do? for even now<br />
In sleep I see her pitiless white brow,<br />
And hear the dreadful sound of her commands,<br />
While with my helpless body and bound hands<br />
I tremble underneath the cruel whips;<br />
And oft for dread of her, with quivering lips<br />
I wake, and waking know the time draws nigh<br />
When nought shall wake me from that misery&mdash;<br />
Behold, O Love, because of thee I live,<br />
Because of thee, with these things still I strive."</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">N</span><span class="caps">ow</span> with the risen sun her weary feet</span><br />
The late-strewn roses of the floor did meet<br />
Upon the marble threshold of the place;<br />
But she being brought before the matchless face,<br />
Fresh with the new life of another day,<br />
Beheld her wondering, for the goddess lay<br />
With half-shut eyes upon her golden bed,<br />
And when she entered scarcely turned her head,<br />
But smiling spake, "The gods are good to thee,<br />
Nor shalt thou always be mine enemy;<br />
But one more task I charge thee with to-day,<br />
Now unto Proserpine take thou thy way,<br />
And give this golden casket to her hands,<br />
And pray the fair Queen of the gloomy lands<br />
To fill the void shell with that beauty rare<br />
That long ago as queen did set her there;<br />
Nor needest thou to fail in this new thing,<br />
Who hast to-day the heart and wit to bring<br />
This dreadful water, and return alive;<br />
And, that thou may'st the more in this thing strive,<br />
If thou returnest I will show at last<br />
My kindness unto thee, and all the past<br />
Shalt thou remember as an ugly dream."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now at first to Psyche did it seem</span><br />
Her heart was softening to her, and the thought<br />
Swelled her full heart to sobbing, and it brought<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>Into her yearning eyes half-happy tears:<br />
But on her way cold thoughts and dreadful fears<br />
Rose in her heart, for who indeed could teach<br />
A living soul that dread abode to reach<br />
And yet return? and then once more it seemed<br />
The hope of mercy was but lightly dreamed,<br />
And she remembered that triumphant smile,<br />
And needs must think, "This is the final wile,<br />
Alas! what trouble must a goddess take<br />
So weak a thing as this poor heart to break.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"See now this tower! from off its top will I</span><br />
Go quick to Proserpine&mdash;ah, good to die!<br />
Rather than hear those shameful words again,<br />
And bear that unimaginable pain<br />
Which she has hoarded for to-morrow morn;<br />
Now is the ending of my life forlorn!<br />
O Love, farewell, thou seest all hope is dead,<br />
Thou seest what torments on my wretched head<br />
Thy bitter mother doth not cease to heap;<br />
Farewell, O Love, for thee and life I weep.<br />
Alas, my foolish heart! alas, my sin!<br />
Alas, for all the love I could not win!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now was this tower both old enough and grey,</span><br />
Built by some king forgotten many a day,<br />
And no man dwelt there, now that bitter war<br />
From that bright land had long been driven afar;<br />
There now she entered, trembling and afraid;<br />
But 'neath her doubtful steps the dust long laid<br />
In utter rest, rose up into the air,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>And wavered in the wind that down the stair<br />
Rushed to the door; then she drew back a pace,<br />
Moved by the coolness of the lonely place<br />
That for so long had seen no ray of sun.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then shuddering did she hear these words begun,</span><br />
Like a wind's moaning voice, "Have thou no fear<br />
The hollow words of one long slain to hear!<br />
Thou livest, and thy hope is not yet dead,<br />
And if thou heedest me, thou well may'st tread<br />
The road to hell, and yet return again.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For thou must go o'er many a hill and plain</span><br />
Until to Sparta thou art come at last,<br />
And when the ancient city thou hast passed<br />
A mountain shalt thou reach, that men now call<br />
Mount T&aelig;narus, that riseth like a wall<br />
'Twixt plain and upland, therein shalt thou find<br />
The wide mouth of a cavern huge and blind,<br />
Wherein there cometh never any sun,<br />
Whose dreadful darkness all things living shun;<br />
This shun thou not, but yet take care to have<br />
Three honey-cakes thy soul alive to save,<br />
And in thy mouth a piece of money set,<br />
Then through the dark go boldly, and forget<br />
The stories thou hast heard of death and hell,<br />
And heed my words, and then shall all be well.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For when thou hast passed through that cavern blind,</span><br />
A place of dim grey meadows shalt thou find,<br />
Wherethrough to inmost hell a path doth lead,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>Which follow thou, with diligence and heed;<br />
For as thou goest there, thou soon shalt see<br />
Two men like peasants loading painfully<br />
A fallen ass; these unto thee will call<br />
To help them, but give thou no heed at all,<br />
But pass them swiftly; and then soon again<br />
Within a shed three crones shalt thou see plain<br />
Busily weaving, who shall bid thee leave<br />
The road and fill their shuttles while they weave,<br />
But slacken not thy steps for all their prayers,<br />
For these are shadows only, and set snares.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"At last thou comest to a water wan,</span><br />
And at the bank shall be the ferryman<br />
Surly and grey; and when he asketh thee<br />
Of money for thy passage, hastily<br />
Show him thy mouth, and straight from off thy lip<br />
The money he will take, and in his ship<br />
Embark thee and set forward; but beware,<br />
For on thy passage is another snare;<br />
From out the waves a grisly head shall come,<br />
Most like thy father thou hast left at home,<br />
And pray for passage long and piteously,<br />
But on thy life of him have no pity,<br />
Else art thou lost; also thy father lives,<br />
And in the temples of the high gods gives<br />
Great daily gifts for thy returning home.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"When thou unto the other side art come,</span><br />
A palace shalt thou see of fiery gold,<br />
And by the door thereof shalt thou behold<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>An ugly triple monster, that shall yell<br />
For thine undoing; now behold him well,<br />
And into each mouth of him cast a cake,<br />
And no more heed of thee then shall he take,<br />
And thou may'st pass into a glorious hall<br />
Where many a wonder hangs upon the wall;<br />
But far more wonderful than anything<br />
The fair slim consort of the gloomy King,<br />
Arrayed all royally shalt thou behold,<br />
Who sitting on a carven throne of gold,<br />
Whene'er thou enterest shall rise up to thee,<br />
And bid thee welcome there most lovingly,<br />
And pray thee on a royal bed to sit,<br />
And share her feast; yet eat thou not of it,<br />
But sitting on the ground eat bread alone,<br />
Then do thy message kneeling by her throne;<br />
And when thou hast the gift, return with speed;<br />
The sleepy dog of thee shall take no heed,<br />
The ferryman shall bear thee on thy way<br />
Without more words, and thou shalt see the day<br />
Unharmed if that dread box thou openest not;<br />
But if thou dost, then death shall be thy lot.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O beautiful, when safe thou com'st again,</span><br />
Remember me, who lie here in such pain<br />
Unburied; set me in some tomb of stone.<br />
When thou hast gathered every little bone;<br />
But never shalt thou set thereon a name,<br />
Because my ending was with grief and shame,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>Who was a Queen like thee long years agone,<br />
And in this tower so long have lain alone."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, pale and full of trouble, Psyche went</span><br />
Bearing the casket, and her footsteps bent<br />
To Laced&aelig;mon, and thence found her way<br />
To T&aelig;narus, and there the golden day<br />
For that dark cavern did she leave behind;<br />
Then, going boldly through it, did she find<br />
The shadowy meads which that wide way ran through,<br />
Under a seeming sky 'twixt grey and blue;<br />
No wind blew there, there was no bird or tree,<br />
Or beast, and dim grey flowers she did but see<br />
That never faded in that changeless place,<br />
And if she had but seen a living face<br />
Most strange and bright she would have thought it there,<br />
Or if her own face, troubled yet so fair,<br />
The still pools by the road-side could have shown<br />
The dimness of that place she might have known;<br />
But their dull surface cast no image back,<br />
For all but dreams of light that land did lack.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So on she passed, still noting every thing,</span><br />
Nor yet had she forgotten there to bring<br />
The honey-cakes and money: in a while<br />
She saw those shadows striving hard to pile<br />
The bales upon the ass, and heard them call,<br />
"O woman, help us! for our skill is small<br />
And we are feeble in this place indeed;"<br />
But swiftly did she pass, nor gave them heed,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>Though after her from far their cries they sent.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then a long way adown that road she went,</span><br />
Not seeing aught, till, as the Shade had said,<br />
She came upon three women in a shed<br />
Busily weaving, who cried, "Daughter, leave<br />
The beaten road a while, and as we weave<br />
Fill thou our shuttles with these endless threads,<br />
For here our eyes are sleepy, and our heads<br />
Are feeble in this miserable place."<br />
But for their words she did but mend her pace,<br />
Although her heart beat quick as she passed by.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then on she went, until she could espy</span><br />
The wan, grey river lap the leaden bank<br />
Wherefrom there sprouted sparsely sedges rank,<br />
And there the road had end in that sad boat<br />
Wherein the dead men unto Minos float;<br />
There stood the ferryman, who now, seeing her, said,<br />
"O living soul, that thus among the dead<br />
Hast come, on whatso errand, without fear,<br />
Know thou that penniless none passes here;<br />
Of all the coins that rich men have on earth<br />
To buy the dreadful folly they call mirth,<br />
But one they keep when they have passed the grave<br />
That o'er this stream a passage they may have;<br />
And thou, though living, art but dead to me,<br />
Who here, immortal, see mortality<br />
Pass, stripped of this last thing that men desire<br />
Unto the changeless meads or changeless fire."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Speechless she shewed the money on her lip</span><br />
Which straight he took, and set her in the ship,<br />
And then the wretched, heavy oars he threw<br />
Into the rowlocks and the flood they drew;<br />
Silent, with eyes that looked beyond her face,<br />
He laboured, and they left the dreary place.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But midmost of that water did arise</span><br />
A dead man, pale, with ghastly staring eyes<br />
That somewhat like her father still did seem,<br />
But in such wise as figures in a dream;<br />
Then with a lamentable voice it cried,<br />
"O daughter, I am dead, and in this tide<br />
For ever shall I drift, an unnamed thing,<br />
Who was thy father once, a mighty king,<br />
Unless thou take some pity on me now,<br />
And bid the ferryman turn here his prow,<br />
That I with thee to some abode may cross;<br />
And little unto thee will be the loss,<br />
And unto me the gain will be to come<br />
To such a place as I may call a home,<br />
Being now but dead and empty of delight,<br />
And set in this sad place 'twixt dark and light."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now at these words the tears ran down apace</span><br />
For memory of the once familiar face,<br />
And those old days, wherein, a little child<br />
'Twixt awe and love beneath those eyes she smiled;<br />
False pity moved her very heart, although<br />
The guile of Venus she failed not to know,<br />
But tighter round the casket clasped her hands,<br />
And shut her eyes, remembering the commands<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>Of that dead queen: so safe to land she came.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there in that grey country, like a flame</span><br />
Before her eyes rose up the house of gold,<br />
And at the gate she met the beast threefold,<br />
Who ran to meet her open-mouthed, but she<br />
Unto his jaws the cakes cast cunningly,<br />
But trembling much; then on the ground he lay<br />
Lolling his heads, and let her go her way;<br />
And so she came into the mighty hall,<br />
And saw those wonders hanging on the wall,<br />
That all with pomegranates was covered o'er<br />
In memory of the meal on that sad shore,<br />
Whereby fair Enna was bewept in vain,<br />
And this became a kingdom and a chain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But on a throne, the Queen of all the dead</span><br />
She saw therein with gold-embrac&eacute;d head,<br />
In royal raiment, beautiful and pale;<br />
Then with slim hands her face did Psyche veil<br />
In worship of her, who said, "Welcome here,<br />
O messenger of Venus! thou art dear<br />
To me thyself indeed, for of thy grace<br />
And loveliness we know e'en in this place;<br />
Rest thee then, fair one, on this royal bed<br />
And with some dainty food shalt thou be fed;<br />
Ho, ye who wait, bring in the tables now!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therewith were brought things glorious of show</span><br />
On cloths and tables royally beseen,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>By damsels each one fairer than a queen,<br />
The very latchets of whose shoes were worth<br />
The royal crown of any queen on earth;<br />
But when upon them Psyche looked, she saw<br />
That all these dainty matters without flaw<br />
Were strange of shape and of strange-blended hues<br />
So every cup and plate did she refuse<br />
Those lovely hands brought to her, and she said,<br />
"O Queen, to me amidst my awe and dread<br />
These things are nought, my message is not done,<br />
So let me rest upon this cold grey stone,<br />
And while my eyes no higher than thy feet<br />
Are lifted, eat the food that mortals eat."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therewith upon the floor she sat her down</span><br />
And from the folded bosom of her gown<br />
Drew forth her bread and ate, while with cold eyes<br />
Regarding her 'twixt anger and surprise,<br />
The Queen sat silent for awhile, then spoke,<br />
"Why art thou here, wisest of living folk?<br />
Depart in haste, lest thou shouldst come to be<br />
Thyself a helpless thing and shadowy!<br />
Give me the casket then, thou need'st not say<br />
Wherefore thou thus hast passed the awful way;<br />
Bide there, and for thy mistress shalt thou have<br />
The charm that beauty from all change can save."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Psyche rose, and from her trembling hand</span><br />
Gave her the casket, and awhile did stand<br />
Alone within the hall, that changing light<br />
From burning streams, and shadowy waves of night<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>Made strange and dread, till to her, standing there<br />
The world began to seem no longer fair,<br />
Life no more to be hoped for, but that place<br />
The peaceful goal of all the hurrying race,<br />
The house she must return to on some day.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then sighing scarcely could she turn away</span><br />
When with the casket came the Queen once more,<br />
And said, "Haste now to leave this shadowy shore<br />
Before thou changest; even now I see<br />
Thine eyes are growing strange, thou look'st on me<br />
E'en as the linnet looks upon the snake.<br />
Behold, thy wisely-guarded treasure take,<br />
And let thy breath of life no longer move<br />
The shadows with the memories of past love."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Psyche at that name, with quickened heart</span><br />
Turned eagerly, and hastened to depart<br />
Bearing that burden, hoping for the day;<br />
Harmless, asleep, the triple monster lay,<br />
The ferryman did set her in his boat<br />
Unquestioned, and together did they float<br />
Over the leaden water back again:<br />
Nor saw she more those women bent with pain<br />
Over their weaving, nor the fallen ass,<br />
But swiftly up the grey road did she pass<br />
And well-nigh now was come into the day<br />
By hollow T&aelig;narus, but o'er the way<br />
The wings of Envy brooded all unseen;<br />
Because indeed the cruel and fair Queen<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>Knew well how she had sped; so in her breast,<br />
Against the which the dreadful box was pressed,<br />
Grew up at last this foolish, harmful thought.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Behold how far this beauty I have brought</span><br />
To give unto my bitter enemy;<br />
Might I not still a very goddess be<br />
If this were mine which goddesses desire,<br />
Yea, what if this hold swift consuming fire,<br />
Why do I think it good for me to live,<br />
That I my body once again may give<br />
Into her cruel hands&mdash;come death! come life!<br />
And give me end to all the bitter strife!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therewith down by the wayside did she sit</span><br />
And turned the box round, long regarding it;<br />
But at the last, with trembling hands, undid<br />
The clasp, and fearfully raised up the lid;<br />
But what was there she saw not, for her head<br />
Fell back, and nothing she remember&eacute;d<br />
Of all her life, yet nought of rest she had,<br />
The hope of which makes hapless mortals glad;<br />
For while her limbs were sunk in deadly sleep<br />
Most like to death, over her heart 'gan creep<br />
Ill dreams; so that for fear and great distress<br />
She would have cried, but in her helplessness<br />
Could open not her mouth, or frame a word;<br />
Although the threats of mocking things she heard,<br />
And seemed, amidst new forms of horror bound,<br />
To watch strange endless armies moving round,<br />
With all their sleepless eyes still fixed on her,<br />
Who from that changeless place should never stir.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>Moveless she lay, and in that dreadful sleep<br />
Scarce had the strength some few slow tears to weep.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there she would have lain for evermore,</span><br />
A marble image on the shadowy shore<br />
In outward seeming, but within oppressed<br />
With torments, knowing neither hope nor rest<br />
But as she lay the Ph&oelig;nix flew along<br />
Going to Egypt, and knew all her wrong,<br />
And pitied her, beholding her sweet face,<br />
And flew to Love and told him of her case;<br />
And Love, in guerdon of the tale he told,<br />
Changed all the feathers of his neck to gold,<br />
And he flew on to Egypt glad at heart.<br />
But Love himself gat swiftly for his part<br />
To rocky T&aelig;narus, and found her there<br />
Laid half a furlong from the outer air.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But at that sight out burst the smothered flame</span><br />
Of love, when he remembered all her shame,<br />
The stripes, the labour, and the wretched fear,<br />
And kneeling down he whispered in her ear,<br />
"Rise, Psyche, and be mine for evermore,<br />
For evil is long tarrying on this shore."<br />
Then when she heard him, straightway she arose,<br />
And from her fell the burden of her woes;<br />
And yet her heart within her well-nigh broke,<br />
When she from grief to happiness awoke;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>And loud her sobbing was in that grey place,<br />
And with sweet shame she covered up her face.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But her dear hands, all wet with tears, he kissed,</span><br />
And taking them about each dainty wrist<br />
Drew them away, and in a sweet voice said,<br />
"Raise up again, O Psyche, that dear head,<br />
And of thy simpleness have no more shame;<br />
Thou hast been tried, and cast away all blame<br />
Into the sea of woes that thou didst bear,<br />
The bitter pain, the hopelessness, the fear&mdash;<br />
Holpen a little, loved with boundless love<br />
Amidst them all&mdash;but now the shadows move<br />
Fast toward the west, earth's day is well-nigh done,<br />
One toil thou hast yet; by to-morrow's sun<br />
Kneel the last time before my mother's feet,<br />
Thy task accomplished; and my heart, O sweet,<br />
Shall go with thee to ease thy toilsome way;<br />
Farewell awhile! but that so glorious day<br />
I promised thee of old, now cometh fast,<br />
When even hope thy soul aside shall cast,<br />
Amidst the joy that thou shalt surely win."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So saying, all that sleep he shut within</span><br />
The dreadful casket, and aloft he flew,<br />
But slowly she unto the cavern drew<br />
Scarce knowing if she dreamed, and so she came<br />
Unto the earth where yet the sun did flame<br />
Low down between the pine-trunks, tall and red,<br />
And with its last beams kissed her golden head.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">W</span><span class="caps">ith</span> what words Love unto the Father prayed</span><br />
I know not, nor what deeds the balance weighed;<br />
But this I know, that he prayed not in vain,<br />
And Psyche's life the heavenly crown shall gain;<br />
So round about the messenger was sent<br />
To tell immortals of their King's intent,<br />
And bid them gather to the Father's hall.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But while they got them ready at his call,</span><br />
On through the night was Psyche toiling still,<br />
To whom no pain nor weariness seemed ill<br />
Since now once more she knew herself beloved;<br />
But when the unresting world again had moved<br />
Round into golden day, she came again<br />
To that fair place where she had borne such pain,<br />
And flushed and joyful in despite her fear,<br />
Unto the goddess did she draw anear,<br />
And knelt adown before her golden seat,<br />
Laying the fatal casket at her feet;<br />
Then at the first no word the Sea-born said,<br />
But looked afar over her golden head,<br />
Pondering upon the mighty deeds of fate;<br />
While Psyche still, as one who well may wait,<br />
Knelt, calm and motionless, nor said a word,<br />
But ever thought of her sweet lovesome lord.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last the Queen said, "Girl, I bid thee rise,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>For now hast thou found favour in mine eyes;<br />
And I repent me of the misery<br />
That in this place thou hast endured of me,<br />
Although because of it, thy joy indeed<br />
Shall now be more, that pleasure is thy meed."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then bending, on the forehead did she kiss</span><br />
Fair Psyche, who turned red for shame and bliss;<br />
But Venus smiled again on her, and said,<br />
"Go now, and bathe, and be as well arrayed<br />
As thou shouldst be, to sit beside my son;<br />
I think thy life on earth is well-nigh done."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So thence once more was Psyche led away,</span><br />
And cast into no prison on that day,<br />
But brought unto a bath beset with flowers,<br />
Made dainty with a fount's sweet-smelling showers,<br />
And there being bathed, e'en in such fair attire<br />
As veils the glorious Mother of Desire<br />
Her limbs were veiled, then in the wavering shade,<br />
Amidst the sweetest garden was she laid,<br />
And while the damsels round her watch did keep,<br />
At last she closed her weary eyes in sleep,<br />
And woke no more to earth, for ere the day<br />
Had yet grown late, once more asleep she lay<br />
Within the West Wind's mighty arms, nor woke<br />
Until the light of heaven upon her broke,<br />
And on her trembling lips she felt the kiss<br />
Of very Love, and mortal yet, for bliss<br />
Must fall a-weeping. O for me! that I,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>Who late have told her woe and misery,<br />
Must leave untold the joy unspeakable<br />
That on her tender wounded spirit fell!<br />
Alas! I try to think of it in vain,<br />
My lyre is but attuned to tears and pain,<br />
How shall I sing the never-ending day?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Led by the hand of Love she took her way</span><br />
Unto a vale beset with heavenly trees,<br />
Where all the gathered gods and goddesses<br />
Abode her coming; but when Psyche saw<br />
The Father's face, she fainting with her awe<br />
Had fallen, but that Love's arm held her up.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then brought the cup-bearer a golden cup,</span><br />
And gently set it in her slender hand,<br />
And while in dread and wonder she did stand,<br />
The Father's awful voice smote on her ear,<br />
"Drink now, O beautiful, and have no fear!<br />
For with this draught shalt thou be born again.<br />
And live for ever free from care and pain."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, pale as privet, took she heart to drink,</span><br />
And therewithal most strange new thoughts did think,<br />
And unknown feelings seized her, and there came<br />
Sudden remembrance, vivid as a flame,<br />
Of everything that she had done on earth,<br />
Although it all seemed changed in weight and worth,<br />
Small things becoming great, and great things small;<br />
And godlike pity touched her therewithal<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>For her old self, for sons of men that die;<br />
And that sweet new-born immortality<br />
Now with full love her rested spirit fed.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then in that concourse did she lift her head,</span><br />
And stood at last a very goddess there,<br />
And all cried out at seeing her grown so fair.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So while in heaven quick passed the time away,</span><br />
About the ending of that lovely day,<br />
Bright shone the low sun over all the earth<br />
For joy of such a wonderful new birth.</p></div>

Grew faint and scanty, now his tale had done,<br />

And in those old hearts did the story move<br />
Remembrance of the mighty deeds of love,<br />

Till tears unseen were in their ancient eyes,<br />
And in their yearning hearts unspoken prayers,<br />
And idle seemed the world with all its cares.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Few words they said; the balmy odorous wind</span><br />
Wandered about, some resting-place to find;<br />
The young leaves rustled 'neath its gentle breath,<br />

Adding unnoticed fragrance to the night;<br />
But, as they pondered, a new golden light<br />
Streamed over the green garden, and they heard<br />
Sweet voices sing some ancient poet's word<br />
In praise of May, and then in sight there came<br />
The minstrels' figures underneath the flame<br />
Of scented torches passing 'twixt the trees,<br />
And soon the dusky hall grew bright with these,<br />
And therewithal they put all thought away,<br />
And midst the tinkling harps drank deep to May.</p></div>

The hope of summer oft had been o'ercast,<br />
Ere midst the gardens they once more were met;<br />

The changeful agony of doubtful spring,<br />
For summer pregnant with so many a thing<br />
Was at the door; right hot had been the day<br />

<h2>THE WRITING ON THE IMAGE.</h2>

<h3>ARGUMENT.</h3>

<p class="hang">How on an image that stood anciently in Rome were written certain
words, which none understood, until a Scholar, coming there, knew
their meaning, and thereby discovered great marvels, but withal died
miserably.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">I</span><span class="caps">n</span> half-forgotten days of old,</span><br />
As by our fathers we were told,<br />
Within the town of Rome there stood<br />
An image cut of cornel wood,<br />
And on the upraised hand of it<br />
Men might behold these letters writ:<br />
"<span class="smcap">Percute hic</span>:" which is to say,<br />
In that tongue that we speak to-day,<br />
"<i>Strike here!</i>" nor yet did any know<br />
The cause why this was written so.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus in the middle of the square,</span><br />
In the hot sun and summer air,<br />
The snow-drift and the driving rain,<br />
That image stood, with little pain,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>For twice a hundred years and ten;<br />
While many a band of striving men<br />
Were driven betwixt woe and mirth<br />
Swiftly across the weary earth,<br />
From nothing unto dark nothing:<br />
And many an emperor and king,<br />
Passing with glory or with shame,<br />
Left little record of his name,<br />
And no remembrance of the face<br />
Once watched with awe for gifts or grace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fear little, then, I counsel you,</span><br />
What any son of man can do;<br />
Because a log of wood will last<br />
While many a life of man goes past,<br />
And all is over in short space.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now so it chanced that to this place</span><br />
There came a man of Sicily,<br />
Who when the image he did see,<br />
Knew full well who, in days of yore,<br />
Had set it there; for much strange lore,<br />
In Egypt and in Babylon,<br />
This man with painful toil had won;<br />
And many secret things could do;<br />
So verily full well he knew<br />
That master of all sorcery<br />
Who wrought the thing in days gone by,<br />
And doubted not that some great spell<br />
It guarded, but could nowise tell<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>What it might be. So, day by day,<br />
Still would he loiter on the way,<br />
And watch the image carefully,<br />
Well mocked of many a passer-by.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on a day he stood and gazed</span><br />
Upon the slender finger, raised<br />
Against a doubtful cloudy sky,<br />
Nigh noontide; and thought, "Certainly<br />
The master who made thee so fair<br />
By wondrous art, had not stopped there,<br />
But made thee speak, had he not thought<br />
That thereby evil might be brought<br />
Upon his spell." But as he spoke,<br />
From out a cloud the noon sun broke<br />
With watery light, and shadows cold:<br />
Then did the Scholar well behold<br />
How, from that finger carved to tell<br />
Those words, a short black shadow fell<br />
Upon a certain spot of ground,<br />
And thereon, looking all around<br />
And seeing none heeding, went straightway<br />
Whereas the finger's shadow lay,<br />
And with his knife about the place<br />
A little circle did he trace;<br />
Then home he turned with throbbing head,<br />
And forthright gat him to his bed,<br />
And slept until the night was late<br />
And few men stirred from gate to gate.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So when at midnight he did wake,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>Pickaxe and shovel did he take,<br />
And, going to that now silent square,<br />
He found the mark his knife made there,<br />
And quietly with many a stroke<br />
The pavement of the place he broke:<br />
And so, the stones being set apart,<br />
He 'gan to dig with beating heart,<br />
And from the hole in haste he cast<br />
The marl and gravel; till at last,<br />
Full shoulder high, his arms were jarred,<br />
For suddenly his spade struck hard<br />
With clang against some metal thing:<br />
And soon he found a brazen ring,<br />
All green with rust, twisted, and great<br />
As a man's wrist, set in a plate<br />
Of copper, wrought all curiously<br />
With words unknown though plain to see,<br />
Spite of the rust; and flowering trees,<br />
And beasts, and wicked images,<br />
Whereat he shuddered: for he knew<br />
What ill things he might come to do,<br />
If he should still take part with these<br />
And that Great Master strive to please.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But small time had he then to stand</span><br />
And think, so straight he set his hand<br />
Unto the ring, but where he thought<br />
That by main strength it must be brought<br />
From out its place, lo! easily<br />
It came away, and let him see<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>A winding staircase wrought of stone,<br />
Wherethrough the new-come wind did moan.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then thought he, "If I come alive</span><br />
From out this place well shall I thrive,<br />
For I may look here certainly<br />
The treasures of a king to see,<br />
A mightier man than men are now.<br />
So in few days what man shall know<br />
The needy Scholar, seeing me<br />
Great in the place where great men be,<br />
The richest man in all the land?<br />
Beside the best then shall I stand,<br />
And some unheard-of palace have;<br />
And if my soul I may not save<br />
In heaven, yet here in all men's eyes<br />
Will I make some sweet paradise,<br />
With marble cloisters, and with trees<br />
And bubbling wells, and fantasies,<br />
And things all men deem strange and rare,<br />
And crowds of women kind and fair,<br />
That I may see, if so I please,<br />
Laid on the flowers, or mid the trees<br />
With half-clad bodies wandering.<br />
There, dwelling happier than the king,<br />
What lovely days may yet be mine!<br />
How shall I live with love and wine,<br />
And music, till I come to die!<br />
And then&mdash;&mdash;Who knoweth certainly<br />
What haps to us when we are dead?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>Truly I think by likelihead<br />
Nought haps to us of good or bad;<br />
Therefore on earth will I be glad<br />
A short space, free from hope or fear;<br />
And fearless will I enter here<br />
And meet my fate, whatso it be."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now on his back a bag had he,</span><br />
To bear what treasure he might win,<br />
And therewith now did he begin<br />
To go adown the winding stair;<br />
And found the walls all painted fair<br />
With images of many a thing,<br />
Warrior and priest, and queen and king,<br />
But nothing knew what they might be.<br />
Which things full clearly could he see,<br />
For lamps were hung up here and there<br />
Of strange device, but wrought right fair,<br />
And pleasant savour came from them.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last a curtain, on whose hem</span><br />
Unknown words in red gold were writ,<br />
He reached, and softly raising it<br />
Stepped back, for now did he behold<br />
A goodly hall hung round with gold,<br />
And at the upper end could see<br />
Sitting, a glorious company:<br />
Therefore he trembled, thinking well<br />
They were no men, but fiends of hell.<br />
But while he waited, trembling sore,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>And doubtful of his late-earned lore,<br />
A cold blast of the outer air<br />
Blew out the lamps upon the stair<br />
And all was dark behind him; then<br />
Did he fear less to face those men<br />
Than, turning round, to leave them there<br />
While he went groping up the stair.<br />
Yea, since he heard no cry or call<br />
Or any speech from them at all,<br />
He doubted they were images<br />
Set there some dying king to please<br />
By that Great Master of the art;<br />
Therefore at last with stouter heart<br />
He raised the cloth and entered in<br />
In hope that happy life to win,<br />
And drawing nigher did behold<br />
That these were bodies dead and cold<br />
Attired in full royal guise,<br />
And wrought by art in such a wise<br />
That living they all seemed to be,<br />
Whose very eyes he well could see,<br />
That now beheld not foul or fair,<br />
Shining as though alive they were.<br />
And midmost of that company<br />
An ancient king that man could see,<br />
A mighty man, whose beard of grey<br />
A foot over his gold gown lay;<br />
And next beside him sat his queen<br />
Who in a flowery gown of green<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>And golden mantle well was clad,<br />
And on her neck a collar had<br />
Too heavy for her dainty breast;<br />
Her loins by such a belt were prest<br />
That whoso in his treasury<br />
Held that alone, a king might be.<br />
On either side of these, a lord<br />
Stood heedfully before the board,<br />
And in their hands held bread and wine<br />
For service; behind these did shine<br />
The armour of the guards, and then<br />
The well-attir&eacute;d serving-men,<br />
The minstrels clad in raiment meet;<br />
And over against the royal seat<br />
Was hung a lamp, although no flame<br />
Was burning there, but there was set<br />
Within its open golden fret<br />
A huge carbuncle, red and bright;<br />
Wherefrom there shone forth such a light<br />
That great hall was as clear by it,<br />
As though by wax it had been lit,<br />
As some great church at Easter-tide.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now set a little way aside,</span><br />
Six paces from the da&iuml;s stood<br />
An image made of brass and wood,<br />
In likeness of a full-armed knight<br />
Who pointed 'gainst the ruddy light<br />
A huge shaft ready in a bow.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pondering how he could come to know</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>What all these marvellous matters meant,<br />
About the hall the Scholar went,<br />
Trembling, though nothing moved as yet;<br />
And for awhile did he forget<br />
The longings that had brought him there<br />
In wondering at these marvels fair;<br />
And still for fear he doubted much<br />
One jewel of their robes to touch.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as about the hall he passed</span><br />
He grew more used to them at last,<br />
And thought, "Swiftly the time goes by,<br />
And now no doubt the day draws nigh<br />
Folk will be stirring: by my head<br />
A fool I am to fear the dead,<br />
Who have seen living things enow,<br />
Whose very names no man can know,<br />
Whose shapes brave men might well affright<br />
More than the lion in the night<br />
Wandering for food;" therewith he drew<br />
Unto those royal corpses two,<br />
That on dead brows still wore the crown;<br />
And midst the golden cups set down<br />
The rugged wallet from his back,<br />
Patched of strong leather, brown and black.<br />
Then, opening wide its mouth, took up<br />
From off the board, a golden cup<br />
The King's dead hand was laid upon,<br />
Whose unmoved eyes upon him shone<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>And recked no more of that last shame<br />
Than if he were the beggar lame,<br />
Who in old days was wont to wait<br />
For a dog's meal beside the gate.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of which shame nought our man did reck.</span><br />
But laid his hand upon the neck<br />
Of the slim Queen, and thence undid<br />
The jewelled collar, that straight slid<br />
Down her smooth bosom to the board.<br />
And when these matters he had stored<br />
Safe in his sack, with both their crowns,<br />
The jewelled parts of their rich gowns,<br />
Their shoes and belts, brooches and rings,<br />
And cleared the board of all rich things,<br />
He staggered with them down the hall.<br />
But as he went his eyes did fall<br />
Upon a wonderful green stone,<br />
Upon the hall-floor laid alone;<br />
He said, "Though thou art not so great<br />
To add by much unto the weight<br />
Of this my sack indeed, yet thou,<br />
Certes, would make me rich enow,<br />
That verily with thee I might<br />
Wage one-half of the world to fight<br />
The other half of it, and I<br />
The lord of all the world might die;&mdash;<br />
I will not leave thee;" therewithal<br />
He knelt down midmost of the hall,<br />
Thinking it would come easily<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>Into his hand; but when that he<br />
Gat hold of it, full fast it stack,<br />
So fuming, down he laid his sack,<br />
And with both hands pulled lustily,<br />
But as he strained, he cast his eye<br />
Back to the da&iuml;s; there he saw<br />
The bowman image 'gin to draw<br />
The mighty bowstring to his ear,<br />
So, shrieking out aloud for fear,<br />
Of that rich stone he loosed his hold<br />
And catching up his bag of gold,<br />
Gat to his feet: but ere he stood<br />
The evil thing of brass and wood<br />
Up to his ear the notches drew;<br />
And clanging, forth the arrow flew,<br />
And midmost of the carbuncle<br />
Clanging again, the forked barbs fell,<br />
And all was dark as pitch straightway.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So there until the judgment day</span><br />
Shall come and find his bones laid low<br />
And raise them up for weal or woe,<br />
This man must bide; cast down he lay<br />
While all his past life day by day<br />
In one short moment he could see<br />
Drawn out before him, while that he<br />
In terror by that fatal stone<br />
Was laid, and scarcely dared to moan.<br />
But in a while his hope returned,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>And then, though nothing he discerned,<br />
He gat him up upon his feet,<br />
And all about the walls he beat<br />
To find some token of the door,<br />
But never could he find it more,<br />
For by some dreadful sorcery<br />
All was sealed close as it might be<br />
And midst the marvels of that hall<br />
This scholar found the end of all.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But in the town on that same night,</span><br />
An hour before the dawn of light,<br />
Such storm upon the place there fell,<br />
That not the oldest man could tell<br />
Of such another: and thereby<br />
The image was burnt utterly,<br />
Being stricken from the clouds above;<br />
And folk deemed that same bolt did move<br />
The pavement where that wretched one<br />
Unto his foredoomed fate had gone,<br />
Because the plate was set again<br />
Into its place, and the great rain<br />
Washed the earth down, and sorcery<br />
Had hid the place where it did lie.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So soon the stones were set all straight,</span><br />
But yet the folk, afraid of fate,<br />
Where once the man of cornel wood<br />
Through many a year of bad and good<br />
Had kept his place, set up alone<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>Great Jove himself, cut in white stone,<br />
But thickly overlaid with gold.<br />
"Which," saith my tale, "you may behold<br />
Unto this day, although indeed<br />
Some Lord or other, being in need,<br />
Took every ounce of gold away."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now, this tale in some past day</span><br />
Being writ, I warrant all is gone,<br />
Both gold and weather-beaten stone.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be merry, masters, while ye may,</span><br />
For men much quicker pass away.</p></div>

Of other tales of treasure-seekers balked,<br />

Nitocris' tomb, the Niblungs' fatal hoard,<br />
The serpent-guarded treasures of the dead;<br />
Then of how men would be remember&eacute;d<br />
When they are gone; and more than one could tell<br />
Of what unhappy things therefrom befell;<br />
Or how by folly men have gained a name;<br />
A name indeed, not hallowed by the fame<br />

Wilt thou not make us happy on this day?<br />
Across the river thy soft breezes blow<br />
Sweet with the scent of beanfields far away,<br />
Above our heads rustle the aspens grey,<br />
Calm is the sky with harmless clouds beset,<br />
No thought of storm the morning vexes yet.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">See, we have left our hopes and fears behind</span><br />
To give our very hearts up unto thee;<br />
What better place than this then could we find<br />
By this sweet stream that knows not of the sea,<br />
That guesses not the city's misery,<br />
This little stream whose hamlets scarce have names,<br />
This far-off, lonely mother of the Thames?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here then, O June, thy kindness will we take;</span><br />
And if indeed but pensive men we seem,<br />
What should we do? thou wouldst not have us wake<br />
From out the arms of this rare happy dream<br />
And wish to leave the murmur of the stream,<br />
The rustling boughs, the twitter of the birds,<br />
And all thy thousand peaceful happy words.</p></div>

That they should go unto a house that stood<br />
On their chief river, so upon a day<br />
With favouring wind and tide they took their way<br />
Up the fair stream; most lovely was the time<br />
Even amidst the days of that fair clime,<br />
And still the wanderers thought about their lives,<br />
And that desire that rippling water gives<br />
To youthful hearts to wander anywhere.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So midst sweet sights and sounds a house most fair</span><br />
They came to, set upon the river side<br />
Where kindly folk their coming did abide;<br />
There they took land, and in the lime-trees' shade<br />
Beneath the trees they found the fair feast laid,<br />
And sat, well pleased; but when the water-hen<br />
Had got at last to think them harmless men,<br />
And they with rest, and pleasure, and old wine,<br />
Began to feel immortal and divine,<br />
An elder spoke, "O gentle friends, the day<br />
Amid such calm delight now slips away,<br />
And ye yourselves are grown so bright and glad<br />
I care not if I tell you something sad;<br />
Sad, though the life I tell you of passed by,<br />
Unstained by sordid strife or misery;<br />
Sad, because though a glorious end it tells,<br />
Yet on the end of glorious life it dwells,<br />
And striving through all things to reach the best<br />
Upon no midway happiness will rest."</p></div>

<h2>THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS.</h2>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p class="hang">Admetus, King of Pher&aelig; in Thessaly, received unwittingly Apollo as his
servant, by the help of whom he won to wife Alcestis, daughter of
Pelias: afterwards too, as in other things, so principally in this,
Apollo gave him help, that when he came to die, he obtained of the
Fates for him, that if another would die willingly in his stead, then
he should live still; and when to every one else this seemed
impossible, Alcestis gave her life for her husband's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">M</span><span class="caps">idst</span> sunny grass-clad meads that slope adown</span><br />
To lake B&oelig;beis stands an ancient town,<br />
Where dwelt of old a lord of Thessaly,<br />
The son of Pheres and fair Clymene,<br />
Who had to name Admetus: long ago<br />
The dwellers by the lake have ceased to know<br />
His name, because the world grows old, but then<br />
He was accounted great among great men;<br />
Young, strong, and godlike, lacking nought at all<br />
Of gifts that unto royal men might fall<br />
In those old simple days, before men went<br />
To gather unseen harm and discontent,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>Along with all the alien merchandise<br />
That rich folk need, too restless to be wise.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now on the fairest of all autumn eves,</span><br />
When midst the dusty, crumpled, dying leaves<br />
The black grapes showed, and every press and vat<br />
Was newly scoured, this King Admetus sat<br />
Among his people, wearied in such wise<br />
By hopeful toil as makes a paradise<br />
Of the rich earth; for light and far away<br />
Seemed all the labour of the coming day,<br />
And no man wished for more than then he had,<br />
Nor with another's mourning was made glad.<br />
There in the pillared porch, their supper done,<br />
They watched the fair departing of the sun;<br />
The while the soft-eyed well-girt maidens poured<br />
The joy of life from out the jars long stored<br />
Deep in the earth, while little like a king,<br />
As we call kings, but glad with everything,<br />
The wise Thessalian sat and blessed his life,<br />
So free from sickening fear and foolish strife.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But midst the joy of this festivity,</span><br />
Turning aside he saw a man draw nigh,<br />
Along the dusty grey vine-bordered road<br />
That had its ending at his fair abode;<br />
He seemed e'en from afar to set his face<br />
Unto the King's adorn&eacute;d reverend place,<br />
And like a traveller went he wearily,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>And yet as one who seems his rest to see.<br />
A staff he bore, but nowise was he bent<br />
With scrip or wallet; so withal he went<br />
Straight to the King's high seat, and standing near,<br />
Seemed a stout youth and noble, free from fear,<br />
But peaceful and unarmed; and though ill clad,<br />
And though the dust of that hot land he had<br />
Upon his limbs and face, as fair was he<br />
As any king's son you might lightly see,<br />
Grey-eyed and crisp-haired, beautiful of limb,<br />
And no ill eye the women cast on him.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But kneeling now, and stretching forth his hand,</span><br />
He said, "O thou, the king of this fair land,<br />
Unto a banished man some shelter give,<br />
And help me with thy goods that I may live:<br />
Thou hast good store, Admetus, yet may I,<br />
Who kneel before thee now in misery,<br />
Give thee more gifts before the end shall come<br />
Than all thou hast laid safely in thine home."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Rise up, and be my guest," Admetus said,</span><br />
"I need no gifts for this poor gift of bread,<br />
The land is wide, and bountiful enow.<br />
What thou canst do, to-morrow thou shalt show,<br />
And be my man, perchance; but this night rest<br />
Not questioned more than any passing guest.<br />
Yea, even if a great king thou hast spilt,<br />
Thou shall not answer aught but as thou wilt."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then the man rose and said, "O King, indeed</span><br />
Of thine awarded silence have I need,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>Nameless I am, nameless what I have done<br />
Must be through many circles of the sun.<br />
But for to-morrow&mdash;let me rather tell<br />
On this same eve what things I can do well,<br />
And let me put mine hand in thine and swear<br />
To serve thee faithfully a changing year;<br />
Nor think the woods of Ossa hold one beast<br />
That of thy tenderest yearling shall make feast,<br />
Whiles that I guard thy flocks, and thou shalt bear<br />
Thy troubles easier when thou com'st to hear<br />
The music I can make. Let these thy men<br />
Witness against me if I fail thee, when<br />
War falls upon thy lovely land and thee."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then the King smiled, and said, "So let it be,</span><br />
Well shalt thou serve me, doing far less than this,<br />
Nor for thy service due gifts shalt thou miss:<br />
Behold I take thy faith with thy right hand,<br />
Be thou true man unto this guarded land.<br />
Ho ye! take this my guest, find raiment meet<br />
Wherewith to clothe him; bathe his wearied feet,<br />
And bring him back beside my throne to feast."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But to himself he said, "I am the least</span><br />
Of all Thessalians if this man was born<br />
In any earthly dwelling more forlorn<br />
Than a king's palace."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">Then a damsel slim</span><br />
Led him inside, nought loth to go with him,<br />
And when the cloud of steam had curled to meet<br />
Within the brass his wearied dusty feet,<br />
She from a carved press brought him linen fair,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>And a new-woven coat a king might wear,<br />
And so being clad he came unto the feast,<br />
But as he came again, all people ceased<br />
What talk they held soever, for they thought<br />
A very god among them had been brought;<br />
And doubly glad the king Admetus was<br />
At what that dying eve had brought to pass,<br />
And bade him sit by him and feast his fill.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So there they sat till all the world was still,</span><br />
And 'twixt the pillars their red torches' shine<br />
Held forth unto the night a joyous sign.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span class="big">S</span><span class="caps">o</span> henceforth did this man at Pher&aelig; dwell,<br />
And what he set his hand to wrought right well,<br />
And won much praise and love in everything,<br />
And came to rule all herdsmen of the King;<br />
But for two things in chief his fame did grow;<br />
And first that he was better with the bow<br />
Than any 'twixt Olympus and the sea,<br />
And then that sweet, heart-piercing melody<br />
He drew out from the rigid-seeming lyre,<br />
And made the circle round the winter fire<br />
More like to heaven than gardens of the May.<br />
So many a heavy thought he chased away<br />
From the King's heart, and softened many a hate,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>And choked the spring of many a harsh debate;<br />
And, taught by wounds, the snatchers of the wolds<br />
Lurked round the gates of less well-guarded folds.<br />
Therefore Admetus loved him, yet withal,<br />
Strange doubts and fears upon his heart did fall;<br />
For morns there were when he the man would meet,<br />
His hair wreathed round with bay and blossoms sweet,<br />
Gazing distraught into the brightening east,<br />
Nor taking heed of either man or beast,<br />
Or anything that was upon the earth.<br />
Or sometimes, midst the hottest of the mirth,<br />
Within the King's hall, would he seem to wake<br />
As from a dream, and his stringed tortoise take<br />
And strike the cords unbidden, till the hall<br />
Filled with the glorious sound from wall to wall,<br />
Trembled and seemed as it would melt away,<br />
And sunken down the faces weeping lay<br />
That erewhile laughed the loudest; only he<br />
Stood upright, looking forward steadily<br />
With sparkling eyes as one who cannot weep,<br />
Until the storm of music sank to sleep.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But this thing seemed the doubtfullest of all</span><br />
Unto the King, that should there chance to fall<br />
A festal day, and folk did sacrifice<br />
Unto the gods, ever by some device<br />
The man would be away: yet with all this<br />
His presence doubled all Admetus' bliss,<br />
And happy in all things he seemed to live,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>And great gifts to his herdsman did he give.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now the year came round again to spring,</span><br />
And southward to Iolchos went the King;<br />
For there did Pelias hold a sacrifice<br />
Unto the gods, and put forth things of price<br />
For men to strive for in the people's sight;<br />
So on a morn of April, fresh and bright,<br />
Admetus shook the golden-studded reins,<br />
And soon from windings of the sweet-banked lanes<br />
The south wind blew the sound of hoof and wheel,<br />
Clatter of brazen shields and clink of steel<br />
Unto the herdsman's ears, who stood awhile<br />
Hearkening the echoes with a godlike smile,<br />
Then slowly gat him foldwards, murmuring,<br />
"Fair music for the wooing of a King."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But in six days again Admetus came,</span><br />
With no lost labour or dishonoured name;<br />
A scarlet cloak upon his back he bare<br />
A gold crown on his head, a falchion fair<br />
Girt to his side; behind him four white steeds,<br />
Whose dams had fed full in Nis&aelig;an meads;<br />
All prizes that his valiant hands had won<br />
Within the guarded lists of Tyro's son.<br />
Yet midst the sound of joyous minstrelsy<br />
No joyous man in truth he seemed to be;<br />
So that folk looking on him said, "Behold,<br />
The wise King will not show himself too bold<br />
Amidst his greatness: the gods too are great,<br />
And who can tell the dreadful ways of fate?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Howe'er it was, he gat him through the town,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>And midst their shouts at last he lighted down<br />
At his own house, and held high feast that night;<br />
And yet by seeming had but small delight<br />
In aught that any man could do or say:<br />
And on the morrow, just at dawn of day,<br />
Rose up and clad himself, and took his spear.<br />
And in the fresh and blossom-scented air<br />
Went wandering till he reach B&oelig;beis' shore;<br />
Yet by his troubled face set little store<br />
By all the songs of birds and scent of flowers;<br />
Yea, rather unto him the fragrant hours<br />
Were grown but dull and empty of delight.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So going, at the last he came in sight</span><br />
Of his new herdsman, who that morning lay<br />
Close by the white sand of a little bay<br />
The teeming ripple of B&oelig;beis lapped;<br />
There he in cloak of white-wooled sheepskin wrapped<br />
Against the cold dew, free from trouble sang,<br />
The while the heifers' bells about him rang<br />
And mingled with the sweet soft-throated birds<br />
And bright fresh ripple: listen, then, these words<br />
Will tell the tale of his felicity,<br />
Halting and void of music though they be.</p></div>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cumbered with lies and soiled with shame?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And if the gods care not for you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What is this folly ye must do</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To win some mortal's feeble heart?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O fools! when each man plays his part,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And heeds his fellow little more</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than these blue waves that kiss the shore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Take heed of how the daisies grow.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O fools! and if ye could but know</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How fair a world to you is given.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O brooder on the hills of heaven,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When for my sin thou drav'st me forth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hadst thou forgot what this was worth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thine own hand had made? The tears of men,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The death of threescore years and ten,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The trembling of the timorous race&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had these things so bedimmed the place</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thine own hand made, thou couldst not know</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To what a heaven the earth might grow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If fear beneath the earth were laid,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If hope failed not, nor love decayed.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He stopped, for he beheld his wandering lord,</span><br />
Who, drawing near, heard little of his word,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>And noted less; for in that haggard mood<br />
Nought could he do but o'er his sorrows brood,<br />
Whate'er they were, but now being come anigh,<br />
He lifted up his drawn face suddenly,<br />
And as the singer gat him to his feet,<br />
His eyes Admetus' troubled eyes did meet,<br />
As with some speech he now seemed labouring,<br />
Which from his heart his lips refused to bring.<br />
Then spoke the herdsman, "Master, what is this,<br />
That thou, returned with honour to the bliss,<br />
The gods have given thee here, still makest show<br />
To be some wretch bent with the weight of woe?<br />
What wilt thou have? What help there is in me<br />
Is wholly thine, for in felicity<br />
Within thine house thou still hast let me live,<br />
Nor grudged most noble gifts to me to give."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yea," said Admetus, "thou canst help indeed,</span><br />
But as the spring shower helps the unsown mead.<br />
Yet listen: at Iolchos the first day<br />
Unto Diana's house I took my way,<br />
Where all men gathered ere the games began,<br />
There, at the right side of the royal man,<br />
Who rules Iolchos, did his daughter stand,<br />
Who with a suppliant bough in her right hand<br />
Headed the band of maidens; but to me<br />
More than a goddess did she seem to be,<br />
Nor fit to die; and therewithal I thought<br />
That we had all been thither called for nought<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>But that her bridegroom Pelias might choose,<br />
And with that thought desire did I let loose,<br />
And striving not with Love, I gazed my fill,<br />
As one who will not fear the coming ill:<br />
All, foolish were mine eyes, foolish my heart,<br />
To strive in such a marvel to have part!<br />
What god shall wed her rather? no more fear<br />
Than vexes Pallas vexed her forehead clear,<br />
Faith shone from out her eyes, and on her lips<br />
Unknown love trembled; the Ph&oelig;nician ships<br />
Within their dark holds nought so precious bring<br />
As her soft golden hair, no daintiest thing<br />
I ever saw was half so wisely wrought<br />
As was her rosy ear; beyond all thought,<br />
All words to tell of, her veiled body showed,<br />
As, by the image of the Three-formed bowed,<br />
She laid her offering down; then I drawn near<br />
The murmuring of her gentle voice could hear,<br />
As waking one hears music in the morn,<br />
Ere yet the fair June sun is fully born;<br />
And sweeter than the roses fresh with dew<br />
Sweet odours floated round me, as she drew<br />
Some golden thing from out her balmy breast<br />
With her right hand, the while her left hand pressed<br />
The hidden wonders of her girdlestead;<br />
And when abashed I sank adown my head,<br />
Dreading the god of Love, my eyes must meet<br />
The happy bands about her perfect feet.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What more? thou know'st perchance what thing love is?</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>Kindness, and hot desire, and rage, and bliss,<br />
None first a moment; but before that day<br />
No love I knew but what might pass away<br />
When hot desire was changed to certainty,<br />
Or not abide much longer; e'en such stings<br />
Had smitten me, as the first warm day brings<br />
When March is dying; but now half a god<br />
The crowded way unto the lists I trod,<br />
Yet hopeless as a vanquished god at whiles,<br />
And hideous seemed the laughter and the smiles,<br />
And idle talk about me on the way.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But none could stand before me on that day,</span><br />
I was as god-possessed, not knowing how<br />
The King had brought her forth but for a show,<br />
To make his glory greater through the land:<br />
Therefore at last victorious did I stand<br />
Among my peers, nor yet one well-known name<br />
Had gathered any honour from my shame.<br />
For there indeed both men of Thessaly,<br />
&OElig;tolians, Thebans, dwellers by the sea,<br />
And folk of Attica and Argolis,<br />
Arcadian woodmen, islanders, whose bliss<br />
Is to be tossed about from wave to wave,<br />
All these at last to me the honour gave,<br />
Nor did they grudge it: yea, and one man said,<br />
A wise Thessalian with a snowy head,<br />
And voice grown thin with age, 'O Pelias,<br />
Surely to thee no evil thing it was<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>That to thy house this rich Thessalian<br />
Should come, to prove himself a valiant man<br />
Amongst these heroes; for if I be wise<br />
By dint of many years, with wistful eyes<br />
Doth he behold thy daughter, this fair maid;<br />
And surely, if the matter were well weighed,<br />
Good were it both for thee and for the land<br />
That he should take the damsel by the hand<br />
And lead her hence, for ye near neighbours dwell;<br />
What sayest thou, King, have I said ill or well?'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"With that must I, a fool, stand forth and ask</span><br />
If yet there lay before me some great task<br />
That I must do ere I the maid should wed,<br />
But Pelias, looking on us, smiled and said,<br />
'O neighbour of Larissa, and thou too,<br />
O King Admetus, this may seem to you<br />
A little matter; yea, and for my part<br />
E'en such a marriage would make glad my heart;<br />
But we the blood of Salmoneus who share<br />
With godlike gifts great burdens also bear,<br />
Nor is this maid without them, for the day<br />
On which her maiden zone she puts away<br />
Shall be her death-day, if she wed with one<br />
By whom this marvellous thing may not be done,<br />
For in the traces neither must steeds paw<br />
Before my threshold, or white oxen draw<br />
The wain that comes my maid to take from me,<br />
Far other beasts that day her slaves must be:<br />
The yellow lion 'neath the lash must roar,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>And by his side unscared, the forest boar<br />
Toil at the draught: what sayest thou then hereto,<br />
O lord of Pher&aelig;, wilt thou come to woo<br />
In such a chariot, and win endless fame,<br />
Or turn thine eyes elsewhere with little shame?'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What answered I? O herdsman, I was mad</span><br />
With sweet love and the triumph I had had.<br />
I took my father's ring from off my hand,<br />
And said, 'O heroes of the Grecian land,<br />
Be witnesses that on my father's name<br />
For this man's promise, do I take the shame<br />
Of this deed undone, if I fail herein;<br />
Fear not, O Pelias, but that I shall win<br />
This ring from thee, when I shall come again<br />
Through fair Iolchos, driving that strange wain.<br />
Else by this token, thou, O King, shalt have<br />
Pher&aelig; my home, while on the tumbling wave<br />
A hollow ship my sad abode shall be.'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"So driven by some hostile deity,</span><br />
Such words I said, and with my gifts hard won,<br />
But little valued now, set out upon<br />
My homeward way: but nearer as I drew<br />
To mine abode, and ever fainter grew<br />
In my weak heart the image of my love,<br />
In vain with fear my boastful folly strove;<br />
For I remembered that no god I was<br />
Though I had chanced my fellows to surpass;<br />
And I began to mind me in a while<br />
What murmur rose, with what a mocking smile<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>Pelias stretched out his hand to take the ring.<br />
Made by my drunkard's gift now twice a king:<br />
And when unto my palace-door I came<br />
I had awakened fully to my shame;<br />
For certainly no help is left to me,<br />
But I must get me down unto the sea<br />
And build a keel, and whatso things I may<br />
Set in her hold, and cross the watery way<br />
Whither Jove bids, and the rough winds may blow<br />
Unto a land where none my folly know,<br />
And there begin a weary life anew."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Eager and bright the herdsman's visage grew</span><br />
The while this tale was told, and at the end<br />
He said, "Admetus, I thy life may mend,<br />
And thou at lovely Pher&aelig; still may dwell;<br />
Wait for ten days, and then may all be well,<br />
And thou to fetch thy maiden home may go,<br />
And to the King thy team unheard-of show.<br />
And if not, then make ready for the sea<br />
Nor will I fail indeed to go with thee,<br />
And 'twixt the halyards and the ashen oar<br />
Finish the service well begun ashore;<br />
But meanwhile do I bid thee hope the best;<br />
And take another herdsman for the rest,<br />
For unto Ossa must I go alone<br />
To do a deed not easy to be done."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then springing up he took his spear and bow</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>And northward by the lake-shore 'gan to go;<br />
But the King gazed upon him as he went,<br />
Then, sighing, turned about, and homeward bent<br />
His lingering steps, and hope began to spring<br />
Within his heart, for some betokening<br />
He seemed about the herdsman now to see<br />
Of one from mortal cares and troubles free.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so midst hopes and fears day followed day,</span><br />
Until at last upon his bed he lay<br />
When the grey, creeping dawn had now begun<br />
To make the wide world ready for the sun<br />
On the tenth day: sleepless had been the night<br />
And now in that first hour of gathering light<br />
For weariness he slept, and dreamed that he<br />
Stood by the border of a fair, calm sea<br />
At point to go a-shipboard, and to leave<br />
Whatever from his sire he did receive<br />
Of land or kingship; and withal he dreamed<br />
That through the cordage a bright light there gleamed<br />
Far off within the east; and nowise sad<br />
He felt at leaving all he might have had,<br />
But rather as a man who goes to see<br />
Some heritage expected patiently.<br />
But when he moved to leave the firm fixed shore,<br />
The windless sea rose high and 'gan to roar,<br />
And from the gangway thrust the ship aside,<br />
Until he hung over a chasm wide<br />
Vocal with furious waves, yet had no fear<br />
For all the varied tumult he might hear,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>But slowly woke up to the morning light<br />
That to his eyes seemed past all memory bright,<br />
And then strange sounds he heard, whereat his heart<br />
Woke up to joyous life with one glad start,<br />
And nigh his bed he saw the herdsman stand,<br />
Holding a long white staff in his right hand,<br />
Carved with strange figures; and withal he said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Awake, Admetus! loiter not a-bed,</span><br />
But haste thee to bring home thy promised bride,<br />
For now an ivory chariot waits outside,<br />
Yoked to such beasts as Pelias bade thee bring;<br />
Whose guidance thou shalt find an easy thing,<br />
If in thine hands thou holdest still this rod,<br />
Whereon are carved the names of every god<br />

That rules the fertile earth; but having come<br />
Unto King Pelias' well-adorn&eacute;d home,<br />
Abide not long, but take the royal maid,<br />
And let her dowry in thy wain be laid,<br />
Of silver and fine cloth and unmixed gold,<br />
For this indeed will Pelias not withhold<br />
When he shall see thee like a very god.<br />
Then let thy beasts, ruled by this carven rod,<br />
Turn round to Pher&aelig;; yet must thou abide<br />
Before thou comest to the streamlet's side<br />
That feed its dykes; there, by the little wood<br />
Wherein unto Diana men shed blood,<br />
Will I await thee, and thou shalt descend<br />
And hand-in-hand afoot through Pher&aelig; wend;<br />
And yet I bid thee, this night let thy bride<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>Apart among the womenfolk abide;<br />
That on the morrow thou with sacrifice<br />
For these strange deeds may pay a fitting price."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as he spoke with something like to awe,</span><br />
His eyes and much-changed face Admetus saw,<br />
And voiceless like a slave his words obeyed;<br />
For rising up no more delay he made,<br />
But took the staff and gained the palace-door<br />
Where stood the beasts, whose mingled whine and roar<br />
Had wrought his dream; there two and two they stood,<br />
Thinking, it might be, of the tangled wood,<br />
And all the joys of the food-hiding trees,<br />
But harmless as their painted images<br />
'Neath some dread spell; then, leaping up, he took<br />
The reins in hand and the bossed leather shook,<br />
And no delay the conquered beasts durst make<br />
But drew, not silent; and folk just awake<br />
When he went by, as though a god they saw,<br />
Fell on their knees, and maidens come to draw<br />
Fresh water from the fount sank trembling down,<br />
And silence held the babbling wakened town.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So 'twixt the dewy hedges did he wend,</span><br />
And still their noise afar the beasts did send,<br />
His strange victorious advent to proclaim,<br />
Till to Iolchos at the last he came,<br />
And drew anigh the gates, whence in affright<br />
The guards fled, helpless at the wondrous sight;<br />
And through the town news of the coming spread<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>Of some great god so that the scared priests led<br />
Pale suppliants forth; who, in unmeet attire<br />
And hastily-caught boughs and smouldering fire<br />
Within their censers, in the market-place<br />
Awaited him with many an upturned face,<br />
Trembling with fear of that unnamed new god;<br />
But through the midst of them his lions trod<br />
With noiseless feet, nor noted aught their prey,<br />
And the boars' hooves went pattering on the way,<br />
While from their churning tusks the white foam flew<br />
As raging, helpless, in the trace they drew.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Pelias, knowing all the work of fate,</span><br />
Sat in his brazen-pillared porch to wait<br />
The coming of the King; the while the maid<br />
In her fair marriage garments was arrayed,<br />
And from strong places of his treasury<br />
Men brought fine scarlet from the Syrian sea,<br />
And works of brass, and ivory, and gold;<br />
But when the strange yoked beasts he did behold<br />
Come through the press of people terrified,<br />
Then he arose and o'er the clamour cried,<br />
"Hail, thou, who like a very god art come<br />
To bring great honour to my damsel's home;"<br />
And when Admetus tightened rein before<br />
The gleaming, brazen-wrought, half-opened door.<br />
He cried to Pelias, "Hail, to thee, O King;<br />
Let me behold once more my father's ring,<br />
Let me behold the prize that I have won,<br />
Mine eyes are wearying now to look upon."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Fear not," he said, "the Fates are satisfied;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Yet wilt thou not descend and here abide,<br />
Doing me honour till the next bright morn<br />
Has dried the dew upon the new-sprung corn,<br />
That we in turn may give the honour due<br />
To such a man that such a thing can do,<br />
And unto all the gods may sacrifice?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Nay," said Admetus, "if thou call'st me wise,</span><br />
And like a very god thou dost me deem,<br />
Shall I abide the ending of the dream<br />
And so gain nothing? nay, let me be glad<br />
That I at least one godlike hour have had<br />
At whatsoever time I come to die,<br />
That I may mock the world that passes by,<br />
And yet forgets it." Saying this, indeed,<br />
Of Pelias did he seem to take small heed,<br />
But spoke as one unto himself may speak,<br />
And still the half-shut door his eyes did seek,<br />
Wherethrough from distant rooms sweet music came,<br />
Setting his over-strain&eacute;d heart a-flame,<br />
Because amidst the Lydian flutes he thought<br />
From place to place his love the maidens brought.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Pelias said, "What can I give to thee</span><br />
Who fail'st so little of divinity?<br />
Yet let my slaves lay these poor gifts within<br />
Thy chariot, while my daughter strives to win<br />
The favour of the spirits of this place,<br />
Since from their altars she must turn her face<br />
For ever now; hearken, her flutes I hear,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>From the last chapel doth she draw anear."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then by Admetus' feet the folk 'gan pile</span><br />
The precious things, but he no less the while<br />
Stared at the door ajar, and thought it long<br />
Ere with the flutes mingled the maidens' song,<br />
And both grew louder, and the scarce-seen floor<br />
Was fluttering with white raiment, and the door<br />
By slender fingers was set open wide,<br />
And midst her damsels he beheld the bride<br />
Ungirt, with hair unbound and garlanded:<br />
Then Pelias took her slender hand and said,<br />
"Daughter, this is the man that takes from thee<br />
Thy curse midst women, think no more to be<br />
Childless, unloved, and knowing little bliss;<br />
But now behold how like a god he is,<br />
And yet with what prayers for the love of thee<br />
He must have wearied some divinity,<br />
And therefore in thine inmost heart be glad<br />
That thou 'mongst women such a man hast had."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then she with wondering eyes that strange team saw</span><br />
A moment, then as one with gathering awe<br />
Might turn from Jove's bird unto very Jove,<br />
So did she raise her grey eyes to her love,<br />
But to her brow the blood rose therewithal,<br />
And she must tremble, such a look did fall<br />
Upon her faithful eyes, that none the less<br />
Would falter aught, for all her shamefastness,<br />
But rather to her lover's hungry eyes<br />
Gave back a tender look of glad surprise,<br />
Wherein love's flame began to flicker now.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Withal, her father kissed her on the brow,</span><br />
And said, "O daughter, take this royal ring,<br />
And set it on the finger of the King,<br />
And come not back; and thou, Admetus, pour<br />
This wine to Jove before my open door,<br />
And glad at heart take back thine own with thee."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then with that word Alcestis silently,</span><br />
And with no look cast back, and ring in hand,<br />
Went forth, and soon beside her love did stand,<br />
Nor on his finger failed to set the ring;<br />
And then a golden cup the city's King<br />
Gave to him, and he poured and said, "O thou,<br />
From whatsoever place thou lookest now,<br />
What prayers, what gifts unto thee shall I give<br />
That we a little time with love may live?<br />
A little time of love, then fall asleep<br />
Together, while the crown of love we keep."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So spake he, and his strange beasts turned about,</span><br />
And heeded not the people's wavering shout<br />
That from their old fear and new pleasure sprung,<br />
Nor noted aught of what the damsels sung,<br />
Or of the flowers that after them they cast,<br />
But like a dream the guarded city passed,<br />
And 'twixt the song of birds and blossoms' scent<br />
It seemed for many hundred years they went,<br />
Though short the way was unto Pher&aelig;'s gates;<br />
Time they forgat, and gods, and men, and fates,<br />
However nigh unto their hearts they were;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>The woodland boars, the yellow lords of fear<br />
No more seemed strange to them, but all the earth<br />
With all its changing sorrow and wild mirth<br />
In that fair hour seemed new-born to the twain,<br />
Grief seemed a play forgot, a pageant vain,<br />
A picture painted, who knows where or when,<br />
With soulless images of restless men;<br />
For every thought but love was now gone by,<br />
And they forgot that they should ever die.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when they came anigh the sacred wood,</span><br />
There, biding them, Admetus' herdsman stood,<br />
At sight of whom those yoke-fellows unchecked<br />
Stopped dead and little of Admetus recked<br />
Who now, as one from dreams not yet awake,<br />
Drew back his love and did his wain forsake,<br />
And gave the carven rod and guiding bands<br />
Into the waiting herdsman's outstretched hands,<br />
But when he would have thanked him for the thing<br />
That he had done, his speechless tongue must cling<br />
Unto his mouth, and why he could not tell.<br />
But the man said, "No words! thou hast done well<br />
To me, as I to thee; the day may come<br />
When thou shalt ask me for a fitting home,<br />
Nor shalt thou ask in vain; but hasten now,<br />
And to thine house this royal maiden show,<br />
Then give her to thy women for this night.<br />
But when thou wakest up to thy delight<br />
To-morrow, do all things that should be done,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>Nor of the gods, forget thou any one,<br />
And on the next day will I come again<br />
To tend thy flocks upon the grassy plain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But now depart, and from thine home send here</span><br />
Chariot and horse, these gifts of thine to bear<br />
Unto thine house, and going, look not back<br />
Lest many a wished-for thing thou com'st to lack."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then hand in hand together, up the road</span><br />
The lovers passed unto the King's abode,<br />
And as they went, the whining snort and roar<br />
From the yoked beasts they heard break out once more<br />
And then die off, as they were led away,<br />
But whether to some place lit up by day,<br />
Or, 'neath the earth, they knew not, for the twain<br />
Went hastening on, nor once looked back again.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But soon the minstrels met them, and a band</span><br />
Of white-robed damsels flowery boughs in hand,<br />
To bid them welcome to that pleasant place.<br />
Then they, rejoicing much, in no long space<br />
Came to the brazen-pillared porch, whereon<br />
From 'twixt the passes of the hills yet shone<br />
The dying sun; and there she stood awhile<br />
Without the threshold, a faint tender smile<br />
Trembling upon her lips 'twixt love and shame,<br />
Until each side of her a maiden came<br />
And raised her in their arms, that her fair feet<br />
The polished brazen threshold might not meet,<br />
And in Admetus' house she stood at last.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But to the women's chamber straight she passed</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>Bepraised of all,&mdash;and so the wakeful night<br />
Lonely the lovers passed e'en as they might.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the next day with many a sacrifice,</span><br />
Admetus wrought, for such a well-won prize,<br />
A life so blest, the gods to satisfy,<br />
And many a matchless beast that day did die<br />
Upon the altars; nought unlucky seemed<br />
To be amid the joyous crowd that gleamed<br />
With gold and precious things, and only this<br />
Seemed wanting to the King of Pher&aelig;'s bliss,<br />
That all these pageants should be soon past by,<br />
And hid by night the fair spring blossoms lie.</p></div>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">Y</span><span class="caps">et</span> on the morrow-morn Admetus came,</span><br />
A haggard man oppressed with grief and shame<br />
Unto the spot beside B&oelig;beis' shore<br />
Whereby he met his herdsman once before,<br />
And there again he found him flushed and glad,<br />
And from the babbling water newly clad,<br />
Then he with downcast eyes these words began,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O thou, whatso thy name is, god or man,</span><br />
Hearken to me; meseemeth of thy deed<br />
Some dread immortal taketh angry heed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Last night the height of my desire seemed won,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>All day my weary eyes had watched the sun<br />
Rise up and sink, and now was come the night<br />
When I should be alone with my delight;<br />
Silent the house was now from floor to roof,<br />
And in the well-hung chambers, far aloof,<br />
The feasters lay; the moon was in the sky,<br />
The soft spring wind was wafting lovingly<br />
Across the gardens fresh scents to my sweet,<br />
As, troubled with the sound of my own feet,<br />
I passed betwixt the pillars, whose long shade<br />
Black on the white red-vein&eacute;d floor was laid:<br />
So happy was I that the briar-rose,<br />
Rustling outside within the flowery close,<br />
Seemed but Love's odorous wing&mdash;too real all seemed<br />
For such a joy as I had never dreamed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Why do I linger, as I lingered not</span><br />
In that fair hour, now ne'er to be forgot<br />
While my life lasts?&mdash;Upon the gilded door<br />
I laid my hand; I stood upon the floor<br />
Of the bride-chamber, and I saw the bride,<br />
Lovelier than any dream, stand by the side<br />
Of the gold bed, with hands that hid her face:<br />
One cry of joy I gave, and then the place<br />
Seemed changed to hell as in a hideous dream.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Still did the painted silver pillars gleam</span><br />
Betwixt the scented torches and the moon;<br />
Still did the garden shed its odorous boon<br />
Upon the night; still did the nightingale<br />
Unto his brooding mate tell all his tale:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>But, risen 'twixt my waiting love and me,<br />
As soundless as the dread eternity,<br />
Sprung up from nothing, could mine eyes behold<br />
A huge dull-gleaming dreadful coil that rolled<br />
In changing circles on the pavement fair.<br />
Then for the sword that was no longer there<br />
My hand sank to my side; around I gazed,<br />
And 'twixt the coils I met her grey eyes, glazed<br />
With sudden horror most unspeakable;<br />
And when mine own upon no weapon fell,<br />
For what should weapons do in such a place,<br />
Unto the dragon's head I set my face,<br />
And raised bare hands against him, but a cry<br />
Burst on mine ears of utmost agony<br />
That nailed me there, and she cried out to me,<br />
'O get thee hence; alas, I cannot flee!<br />
They coil about me now, my lips to kiss.<br />
O love, why hast thou brought me unto this?'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Alas, my shame! trembling, away I slunk,</span><br />
Yet turning saw the fearful coil had sunk<br />
To whence it came, my love's limbs freed I saw,<br />
And a long breath at first I heard her draw<br />
As one redeemed, then heard the hard sobs come,<br />
And wailings for her new accurs&eacute;d home.<br />
But there outside across the door I lay,<br />
Like a scourged hound, until the dawn of day;<br />
And as her gentle breathing then I heard<br />
As though she slept, before the earliest bird<br />
Began his song, I wandered forth to seek<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>Thee, O strange man, e'en as thou seest me, weak<br />
With all the torment of the night, and shamed<br />
With such a shame as never shall be named<br />
To aught but thee&mdash;Yea, yea, and why to thee<br />
Perchance this ends all thou wilt do for me?&mdash;<br />
What then, and have I not a cure for that?<br />
Lo, yonder is a rock where I have sat<br />
Full many an hour while yet my life was life,<br />
With hopes of all the coming wonder rife.<br />
No sword hangs by my side, no god will turn<br />
This cloudless hazy blue to black, and burn<br />
My useless body with his lightning flash;<br />
But the white waves above my bones may wash,<br />
And when old chronicles our house shall name<br />
They may leave out the letters and the shame,<br />
That make Admetus, once a king of men&mdash;<br />
And how could I be worse or better then?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As one who notes a curious instrument</span><br />
Working against the maker's own intent,<br />
The herdsman eyed his wan face silently,<br />
And smiling for a while, and then said he,&mdash;<br />
"Admetus, thou, in spite of all I said,<br />
Hast drawn this evil thing upon thine head,<br />
Forgetting her who erewhile laid the curse<br />
Upon the maiden, so for fear of worse<br />
Go back again; for fair-limbed Artemis<br />
Now bars the sweet attainment of thy bliss;<br />
So taking heart, yet make no more delay<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>But worship her upon this very day,<br />
Nor spare for aught, and of thy trouble make<br />
No semblance unto any for her sake;<br />
And thick upon the fair bride-chamber floor<br />
Strew dittany, and on each side the door<br />
Hang up such poppy-leaves as spring may yield;<br />
And for the rest, myself may be a shield<br />
Against her wrath&mdash;nay, be thou not too bold<br />
To ask me that which may not now be told.<br />
Yea, even what thou deemest, hide it deep<br />
Within thine heart, and let thy wonder sleep,<br />
For surely thou shalt one day know my name,<br />
When the time comes again that autumn's flame<br />
Is dying off the vine-boughs, overturned,<br />
Stripped of their wealth. But now let gifts be burned<br />
To her I told thee of, and in three days<br />
Shall I by many hard and rugged ways<br />
Have come to thee again to bring thee peace.<br />
Go, the sun rises and the shades decrease."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, thoughtfully, Admetus gat him back,</span><br />
Nor did the altars of the Huntress lack<br />
The fattest of the flocks upon that day.<br />
But when night came, in arms Admetus lay<br />
Across the threshold of the bride-chamber,<br />
And nought amiss that night he noted there,<br />
But durst not enter, though about the door<br />
Young poppy-leaves were twined, and on the floor,<br />
Not flowered as yet with downy leaves and grey,<br />
Fresh dittany beloved of wild goats lay.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when the whole three days and nights were done,</span><br />
The herdsman came with rising of the sun,<br />
And said, "Admetus, now rejoice again,<br />
Thy prayers and offerings have not been in vain,<br />
And thou at last mayst come unto thy bliss;<br />
And if thou askest for a sign of this,<br />
Take thou this token; make good haste to rise,<br />
And get unto the garden-close that lies<br />
Below these windows sweet with greenery,<br />
And in the midst a marvel shalt thou see,<br />
Three white, black-hearted poppies blossoming,<br />
Though this is but the middle of the spring."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor was it otherwise than he had said,</span><br />
And on that day with joy the twain were wed,<br />
And 'gan to lead a life of great delight;<br />
But the strange woeful history of that night,<br />
The monstrous car, the promise to the King,<br />
All these through weary hours of chiselling<br />
Were wrought in stone, and in Diana's wall<br />
Set up, a joy and witness unto all.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But neither so would wing&eacute;d time abide,</span><br />
The changing year came round to autumn-tide,<br />
Until at last the day was fully come<br />
When the strange guest first reached Admetus' home.<br />
Then, when the sun was reddening to its end,<br />
He to Admetus' brazen porch did wend,<br />
Whom there he found feathering a poplar dart,<br />
Then said he, "King, the time has come to part.<br />
Come forth, for I have that to give thine ear<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>No man upon the earth but thou must hear."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then rose the King, and with a troubled look</span><br />
His well-steeled spear within his hand he took,<br />
And by his herdsman silently he went<br />
As to a peak&eacute;d hill his steps he bent,<br />
Nor did the parting servant speak one word,<br />
As up they climbed, unto his silent lord,<br />
Till from the top he turned about his head<br />
From all the glory of the gold light, shed<br />
Upon the hill-top by the setting sun,<br />
For now indeed the day was well-nigh done,<br />
And all the eastern vale was grey and cold;<br />
But when Admetus he did now behold,<br />
Panting beside him from the steep ascent,<br />
One much-changed godlike look on him he bent.<br />
And said, "O mortal, listen, for I see<br />
Thou deemest somewhat of what is in me;<br />
Fear not! I love thee, even as I can<br />
Who cannot feel the woes and ways of man<br />
In spite of this my seeming, for indeed<br />
Now thou beholdest Jove's immortal seed,<br />
And what my name is I would tell thee now,<br />
If men who dwell upon the earth as thou<br />
Could hear the name and live; but on the earth.<br />
With strange melodious stories of my birth,<br />
Ph&oelig;bus men call me, and Latona's son.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And now my servitude with thee is done,</span><br />
And I shall leave thee toiling on thine earth,<br />
This handful, that within its little girth<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>Holds that which moves you so, O men that die;<br />
Behold, to-day thou hast felicity,<br />
But the times change, and I can see a day<br />
When all thine happiness shall fade away;<br />
And yet be merry, strive not with the end,<br />
Thou canst not change it; for the rest, a friend<br />
This year has won thee who shall never fail;<br />
But now indeed, for nought will it avail<br />
To say what I may have in store for thee,<br />
Of gifts that men desire; let these things be,<br />
And live thy life, till death itself shall come,<br />
And turn to nought the storehouse of thine home,<br />
Then think of me; these feathered shafts behold,<br />
That here have been the terror of the wold,<br />
Take these, and count them still the best of all<br />
Thine envied wealth, and when on thee shall fall<br />
By any way the worst extremity,<br />
Call upon me before thou com'st to die,<br />
And lay these shafts with incense on a fire,<br />
That thou mayst gain thine uttermost desire."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He ceased, but ere the golden tongue was still</span><br />
An odorous mist had stolen up the hill,<br />
And to Admetus first the god grew dim,<br />
And then was but a lovely voice to him,<br />
And then at last the sun had sunk to rest,<br />
And a fresh wind blew lightly from the west<br />
Over the hill-top, and no soul was there;<br />
But the sad dying autumn field-flowers fair,<br />
Rustled dry leaves about the windy place,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>Where even now had been the godlike face,<br />
And in their midst the brass-bound quiver lay.<br />
Then, going further westward, far away,<br />
He saw the gleaming of Peneus wan<br />
'Neath the white sky, but never any man,<br />
Except a grey-haired shepherd driving down<br />
From off the long slopes to his fold-yard brown<br />
His woolly sheep, with whom a maiden went,<br />
Singing for labour done and sweet content<br />
Of coming rest; with that he turned again,<br />
And took the shafts up, never sped in vain,<br />
And came unto his house most deep in thought<br />
Of all the things the varied year had brought.</p></div>


<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">T</span><span class="caps">henceforth</span> in bliss and honour day by day</span><br />
His measured span of sweet life wore away.<br />
A happy man he was; no vain desire<br />
Of foolish fame had set his heart a-fire;<br />
No care he had the ancient bounds to change,<br />
Nor yet for him must idle soldiers range<br />
From place to place about the burdened land,<br />
Or thick upon the ruined cornfields stand;<br />
For him no trumpets blessed the bitter war,<br />
Wherein the right and wrong so mingled are,<br />
That hardly can the man of single heart<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>Amid the sickening turmoil choose his part;<br />
For him sufficed the changes of the year,<br />
The god-sent terror was enough of fear<br />
For him; enough the battle with the earth,<br />
The autumn triumph over drought and dearth.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Better to him than wolf-moved battered shields,</span><br />
O'er poor dead corpses, seemed the stubble-fields<br />
Danced down beneath the moon, until the night<br />
Grew dreamy with a shadowy sweet delight,<br />
And with the high-risen moon came pensive thought,<br />
And men in love's despite must grow distraught<br />
And loiter in the dance, and maidens drop<br />
Their gathered raiment, and the fifer stop<br />
His dancing notes the pensive drone that chid,<br />
And as they wander to their dwellings, hid<br />
By the black shadowed trees, faint melody,<br />
Mournful and sweet, their soft good-night must be.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far better spoil the gathering vat bore in</span><br />
Unto the pressing shed, than midst the din<br />
Of falling houses in war's waggon lies<br />
Besmeared with redder stains than Tyrian dyes;<br />
Or when the temple of the sea-born one<br />
With glittering crowns and gallant raiment shone,<br />
Fairer the maidens seemed by no chain bound,<br />
But such as amorous arms might cast around<br />
Their lovely bodies, than the wretched band<br />
Who midst the shipmen by the gangway stand;<br />
Each lonely in her speechless misery,<br />
And thinking of the worse time that shall be,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>When midst of folk who scarce can speak her name,<br />
She bears the uttermost of toil and shame.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Better to him seemed that victorious crown,</span><br />
That midst the reverent silence of the town<br />
He oft would set upon some singer's brow<br />
Than was the conqueror's diadem, blest now<br />
By lying priests, soon, bent and bloody, hung<br />
Within the thorn by linnets well besung,<br />
Who think but little of the corpse beneath,<br />
Though ancient lands have trembled at his breath.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But to this King&mdash;fair Ceres' gifts, the days</span><br />
Whereon men sung in flushed Ly&aelig;us' praise<br />
Tales of old time, the bloodless sacrifice<br />
Unto the goddess of the downcast eyes<br />
And soft persuading lips, the ringing lyre<br />
Unto the bearer of the holy fire<br />
Who once had been amongst them&mdash;things like these<br />
Seemed meet to him men's yearning to appease,<br />
These were the triumphs of the peaceful king.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so, betwixt seed-time and harvesting,</span><br />
With little fear his life must pass away;<br />
And for the rest, he, from the self-same day<br />
That the god left him, seemed to have some share<br />
In that same godhead he had harboured there:<br />
In all things grew his wisdom and his wealth,<br />
And folk beholding the fair state and health<br />
Wherein his land was, said, that now at last<br />
A fragment of the Golden Age was cast<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>Over the place, for there was no debate,<br />
And men forgot the very name of hate.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor failed the love of her he erst had won</span><br />
To hold his heart as still the years wore on,<br />
And she, no whit less fair than on the day<br />
When from Iolchos first she passed away,<br />
Did all his will as though he were a god,<br />
And loving still, the downward way she trod.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Honour and love, plenty and peace, he had;</span><br />
Nor lacked for aught that makes a wise man glad,<br />
That makes him like a rich well-honoured guest<br />
Scarce sorry when the time comes, for the rest,<br />
That at the end perforce must bow his head.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet&mdash;was death not much remember&eacute;d,</span><br />
As still with happy men the manner is?<br />
Or, was he not so pleased with this world's bliss,<br />
As to be sorry when the time should come<br />
When but his name should hold his ancient home<br />
While he dwelt nowhere? either way indeed,<br />
Will be enough for most men's daily need,<br />
And with calm faces they may watch the world,<br />
And note men's lives hither and thither hurled,<br />
As folk may watch the unfolding of a play&mdash;<br />
Nor this, nor that was King Admetus' way,<br />
For neither midst the sweetness of his life<br />
Did he forget the ending of the strife,<br />
Nor yet for heavy thoughts of passing pain<br />
Did all his life seem lost to him or vain,<br />
A wasteful jest of Jove, an empty dream;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>Rather before him did a vague hope gleam,<br />
That made him a great-hearted man and wise,<br />
Who saw the deeds of men with far-seeing eyes,<br />
And dealt them pitying justice still, as though<br />
The inmost heart of each man he did know;<br />
This hope it was, and not his kingly place<br />
That made men's hearts rejoice to see his face<br />
Rise in the council hall; through this, men felt<br />
That in their midst a son of man there dwelt<br />
Like and unlike them, and their friend through all;<br />
And still as time went on, the more would fall<br />
This glory on the King's belov&eacute;d head,<br />
And round his life fresh hope and fear were shed.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet at the last his good days passed away,</span><br />
And sick upon his bed Admetus lay,<br />
'Twixt him and death nought but a lessening veil<br />
Of hasty minutes, yet did hope not fail,<br />
Nor did bewildering fear torment him then,<br />
But still as ever, all the ways of men<br />
Seemed dear to him: but he, while yet his breath<br />
Still held the gateway 'gainst the arms of death,<br />
Turned to his wife, who, bowed beside the bed,<br />
Wept for his love, and dying goodlihead,<br />
And bade her put all folk from out the room,<br />
Then going to the treasury's rich gloom<br />
To bear the arrows forth, the Lycian's gift.<br />
So she, amidst her blinding tears, made shift<br />
To find laid in the inmost treasury<br />
Those shafts, and brought them unto him, but he,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>Beholding them, beheld therewith his life,<br />
Both that now past, with many marvels rife,<br />
And that which he had hoped he yet should see.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then spoke he faintly, "Love, 'twixt thee and me</span><br />
A film has come, and I am failing fast:<br />
And now our ancient happy life is past;<br />
For either this is death's dividing hand,<br />
And all is done, or if the shadowy land<br />
I yet escape, full surely if I live<br />
The god with life some other gift will give,<br />
And change me unto thee: e'en at this tide<br />
Like a dead man among you all I bide,<br />
Until I once again behold my guest,<br />
And he has given me either life or rest:<br />
Alas, my love! that thy too loving heart<br />
Nor with my life or death can have a part.<br />
O cruel words! yet death is cruel too:<br />
Stoop down and kiss me, for I yearn for you<br />
E'en as the autumn yearneth for the sun."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O love, a little time we have been one,</span><br />
And if we now are twain weep not therefore;<br />
For many a man on earth desireth sore<br />
To have some mate upon the toilsome road,<br />
Some sharer of his still increasing load,<br />
And yet for all his longing and his pain<br />
His troubled heart must seek for love in vain,<br />
And till he dies still must he be alone&mdash;<br />
But now, although our love indeed is gone,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>Yet to this land as thou art leal and true<br />
Set now thine hand to what I bid thee do,<br />
Because I may not die; rake up the brands<br />
Upon the hearth, and from these trembling hands<br />
Cast incense thereon, and upon them lay<br />
These shafts, the relics of a happier day,<br />
Then watch with me; perchance I may not die,<br />
Though the supremest hour now draws anigh<br />
Of life or death&mdash;O thou who madest me,<br />
The only thing on earth alike to thee,<br />
Why must I be unlike to thee in this?<br />
Consider, if thou dost not do amiss<br />
To slay the only thing that feareth death<br />
Or knows its name, of all things drawing breath<br />
Upon the earth: see now for no short hour,<br />
For no half-halting death, to reach me slower<br />
Than other men, I pray thee&mdash;what avail<br />
To add some trickling grains unto the tale<br />
Soon told, of minutes thou dost snatch away<br />
From out the midst of that unending day<br />
Wherein thou dwellest? rather grant me this<br />
To right me wherein thou hast done amiss,<br />
And give me life like thine for evermore."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So murmured he, contending very sore</span><br />
Against the coming death; but she meanwhile<br />
Faint with consuming love, made haste to pile<br />
The brands upon the hearth, and thereon cast<br />
Sweet incense, and the feathered shafts at last;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>Then, trembling, back unto the bed she crept,<br />
And lay down by his side, and no more wept,<br />
Nay scarce could think of death for very love<br />
That in her faithful heart for ever strove<br />
'Gainst fear and grief: but now the incense-cloud<br />
The old familiar chamber did enshroud,<br />
And on the very verge of death drawn close<br />
Wrapt both their weary souls in strange repose,<br />
That through sweet sleep sent kindly images<br />
Of simple things; and in the midst of these,<br />
Whether it were but parcel of their dream,<br />
Or that they woke to it as some might deem,<br />
I know not, but the door was opened wide,<br />
And the King's name a voice long silent cried,<br />
And Ph&oelig;bus on the very threshold trod,<br />
And yet in nothing liker to a god<br />
Than when he ruled Admetus' herds, for he<br />
Still wore the homespun coat men used to see<br />
Among the heifers in the summer morn,<br />
And round about him hung the herdsman's horn,<br />
And in his hand he bore the herdsman's spear<br />
And cornel bow, the prowling dog-wolfs fear,<br />
Though empty of its shafts the quiver was.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He to the middle of the room did pass,</span><br />
And said, "Admetus, neither all for nought<br />
My coming to thee is, nor have I brought<br />
Good tidings to thee; poor man, thou shalt live<br />
If any soul for thee sweet life will give<br />
Enforced by none: for such a sacrifice<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>Alone the fates can deem a fitting price<br />
For thy redemption; in no battle-field,<br />
Maddened by hope of glory life to yield,<br />
To give it up to heal no city's shame<br />
In hope of gaining long-enduring fame;<br />
For whoso dieth for thee must believe<br />
That thou with shame that last gift wilt receive,<br />
And strive henceforward with forgetfulness<br />
The honied draught of thy new life to bless.<br />
Nay, and moreover such a glorious heart<br />
Who loves thee well enough with life to part<br />
But for thy love, with life must lose love too,<br />
Which e'en when wrapped about in weeds of woe<br />
Is godlike life indeed to such an one.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And now behold, three days ere life is done</span><br />
Do the Fates give thee, and I, even I,<br />
Upon thy life have shed felicity<br />
And given thee love of men, that they in turn<br />
With fervent love of thy dear love might burn.<br />
The people love thee and thy silk-clad breast,<br />
Thine open doors have given thee better rest<br />
Than woods of spears or hills of walls might do.<br />
And even now in wakefulness and woe<br />
The city lies, calling to mind thy love<br />
Wearying with ceaseless prayers the gods above.<br />
But thou&mdash;thine heart is wise enough to know<br />
That they no whit from their decrees will go."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So saying, swiftly from the room he passed;</span><br />
But on the world no look Admetus cast,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>But peacefully turned round unto the wall<br />
As one who knows that quick death must befall:<br />
For in his heart he thought, "Indeed too well<br />
I know what men are, this strange tale to tell<br />
To those that live with me: yea, they will weep,<br />
And o'er my tomb most solemn days will keep,<br />
And in great chronicles will write my name,<br />
Telling to many an age my deeds and fame.<br />
For living men such things as this desire,<br />
And by such ways will they appease the fire<br />
Of love and grief: but when death comes to stare<br />
Full in men's faces, and the truth lays bare,<br />
How can we then have wish for anything,<br />
But unto life that gives us all to cling?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So said he, and with closed eyes did await,</span><br />
Sleeping or waking, the decrees of fate.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now Alcestis rose, and by the bed</span><br />
She stood, with wild thoughts passing through her head.<br />
Dried were her tears, her troubled heart and sore<br />
Throbbed with the anguish of her love no more.<br />
A strange look on the dying man she cast,<br />
Then covered up her face and said, "O past!<br />
Past the sweet times that I remember well!<br />
Alas, that such a tale my heart can tell!<br />
Ah, how I trusted him! what love was mine!<br />
How sweet to feel his arms about me twine,<br />
And my heart beat with his! what wealth of bliss<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>To hear his praises! all to come to this,<br />
That now I durst not look upon his face,<br />
Lest in my heart that other thing have place.<br />
That which I knew not, that which men call hate.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O me, the bitterness of God and fate!</span><br />
A little time ago we two were one;<br />
I had not lost him though his life was done,<br />
For still was he in me&mdash;but now alone<br />
Through the thick darkness must my soul make moan,<br />
For I must die: how can I live to bear<br />
An empty heart about, the nurse of fear?<br />
How can I live to die some other tide,<br />
And, dying, hear my loveless name outcried<br />
About the portals of that weary land<br />
Whereby my shadowy feet should come to stand.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Alcestis! O Alcestis, hadst thou known</span><br />
That thou one day shouldst thus be left alone,<br />
How hadst thou borne a living soul to love!<br />
Hadst thou not rather lifted hands to Jove,<br />
To turn thine heart to stone, thy front to brass,<br />
That through this wondrous world thy soul might pass,<br />
Well pleased and careless, as Diana goes<br />
Through the thick woods, all pitiless of those<br />
Her shafts smite down? Alas! how could it be<br />
Can a god give a god's delights to thee?<br />
Nay rather, Jove, but give me once again,<br />
If for one moment only, that sweet pain<br />
The love I had while still I thought to live!<br />
Ah! wilt thou not, since unto thee I give<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>My life, my hope?&mdash;But thou&mdash;I come to thee.<br />
Thou sleepest: O wake not, nor speak to me<br />
In silence let my last hour pass away,<br />
And men forget my bitter feeble day."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With that she laid her down upon the bed,</span><br />
And nestling to him, kissed his weary head,<br />
And laid his wasted hand upon her breast,<br />
Yet woke him not; and silence and deep rest<br />
Fell on that chamber. The night wore away<br />
Mid gusts of wailing wind, the twilight grey<br />
Stole o'er the sea, and wrought his wondrous change<br />
On things unseen by night, by day not strange,<br />
But now half seen and strange; then came the sun,<br />
And therewithal the silent world and dun<br />
Waking, waxed many-coloured, full of sound,<br />
As men again their heap of troubles found,<br />
And woke up to their joy or misery.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But there, unmoved by aught, those twain did lie,</span><br />
Until Admetus' ancient nurse drew near<br />
Unto the open door, and full of fear<br />
Beheld them moving not, and as folk dead;<br />
Then, trembling with her eagerness and dread,<br />
She cried, "Admetus! art thou dead indeed?<br />
Alcestis! livest thou my words to heed?<br />
Alas, alas, for this Thessalian folk!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But with her piercing cry the King awoke,</span><br />
And round about him wildly 'gan to stare,<br />
As a bewildered man who knows not where<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>He has awakened: but not thin or wan<br />
His face was now, as of a dying man,<br />
But fresh and ruddy; and his eyes shone clear,<br />
As of a man who much of life may bear.<br />
And at the first, but joy and great surprise<br />
Shone out from those awakened, new-healed eyes;<br />
But as for something more at last he yearned,<br />
Unto his love with troubled brow he turned,<br />
For still she seemed to sleep: alas, alas!<br />
Her lonely shadow even now did pass<br />
Along the changeless fields, oft looking back,<br />
As though it yet had thought of some great lack.<br />
And here, the hand just fallen from off his breast<br />
Was cold; and cold the bosom his hand pressed.<br />
And even as the colour lit the day<br />
The colour from her lips had waned away;<br />
Yet still, as though that longed-for happiness<br />
Had come again her faithful heart to bless,<br />
Those white lips smiled, unwrinkled was her brow,<br />
But of her eyes no secrets might he know,<br />
For, hidden by the lids of ivory,<br />
Had they beheld that death a-drawing nigh.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then o'er her dead corpse King Admetus hung,</span><br />
Such sorrow in his heart as his faint tongue<br />
Refused to utter; yet the just-past night<br />
But dimly he remembered, and the sight<br />
Of the Far-darter, and the dreadful word<br />
That seemed to cleave all hope as with a sword:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>Yet stronger in his heart a knowledge grew,<br />
That nought it was but her fond heart and true<br />
That all the marvel for his love had wrought,<br />
Whereby from death to life he had been brought;<br />
That dead, his life she was, as she had been<br />
His life's delight while still she lived a queen.<br />
And he fell wondering if his life were gain,<br />
So wrapt as then in loneliness and pain;<br />
Yet therewithal no tears would fill his eyes,<br />
For as a god he was.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Then did he rise</span><br />
And gat him down unto the Council-place,<br />
And when the people saw his well-loved face<br />
Then cried aloud for joy to see him there.<br />
And earth again to them seemed blest and fair.<br />
And though indeed they did lament in turn,<br />
When of Alcestis' end they came to learn,<br />
Scarce was it more than seeming, or, at least,<br />
The silence in the middle of a feast,<br />
When men have memory of their heroes slain.<br />
So passed the order of the world again,<br />
Victorious Summer crowning lusty Spring,<br />
Rich Autumn faint with wealth of harvesting,<br />
And Winter the earth's sleep; and then again<br />
Spring, Summer, Autumn, and the Winter's pain:<br />
And still and still the same the years went by.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Time, who slays so many a memory,</span><br />
Brought hers to light, the short-lived loving Queen;<br />
And her fair soul, as scent of flowers unseen,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>Sweetened the turmoil of long centuries.<br />
For soon, indeed, Death laid his hand on these,<br />
The shouters round the throne upon that day.<br />
And for Admetus, he, too, went his way,<br />
Though if he died at all I cannot tell;<br />
But either on the earth he ceased to dwell,<br />
Or else, oft born again, had many a name.<br />
But through all lands of Greece Alcestis' fame<br />
Grew greater, and about her husband's twined<br />
Lived, in the hearts of far-off men enshrined.<br />
See I have told her tale, though I know not<br />
What men are dwelling now on that green spot<br />
Anigh B&oelig;beis, or if Pher&aelig; still,<br />
With name oft changed perchance, adown the hill<br />
Still shows its white walls to the rising sun.<br />
&mdash;The gods at least remember what is done.</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">S</span><span class="caps">trange</span> felt the wanderers at his tale, for now</span><br />
Their old desires it seemed once more to show<br />
Unto their altered hearts, when now the rest,<br />
Most surely coming, of all things seemed best;&mdash;<br />
&mdash;Unless, by death perchance they yet might gain<br />
Some space to try such deeds as now in vain<br />
They heard of amidst stories of the past;<br />
Such deeds as they for that wild hope had cast<br />
From out their hands&mdash;they sighed to think of it,<br />
And how as deedless men they there must sit.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet, with the measured falling of that rhyme</span><br />
Mingled the lovely sights and glorious time,<br />
Whereby, in spite of hope long past away,<br />
In spite of knowledge growing day by day<br />
Of lives so wasted, in despite of death,<br />
With sweet content that eve they drew their breath,<br />
And scarce their own lives seemed to touch them more<br />
Than that dead Queen's beside B&oelig;b&eacute;is' shore;<br />
Bitter and sweet so mingled in them both,<br />
Their lives and that old tale, they had been loth,<br />
Perchance, to have them told another way.&mdash;<br />
So passed the sun from that fair summer day.</p></div>


<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">J</span><span class="caps">une</span> drew unto its end, the hot bright days</span><br />
Now gat from men as much of blame as praise,<br />
As rainless still they passed, without a cloud,<br />
And growing grey at last, the barley bowed<br />
Before the south-east wind. On such a day<br />
These folk amid the trellised roses lay,<br />
And careless for a little while at least,<br />
Crowned with the mingled blossoms held their feast:<br />
Nor did the garden lack for younger folk,<br />
Who cared no more for burning summer's yoke<br />
Than the sweet breezes of the April-tide;<br />
But through the thick trees wandered far and wide<br />
From sun to shade, and shade to sun again,<br />
Until they deemed the elders would be fain<br />
To hear the tale, and shadows longer grew:<br />
Then round about the grave old men they drew,<br />
Both youths and maidens; and beneath their feet<br />
The grass seemed greener, and the flowers more sweet<br />
Unto the elders, as they stood around.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So through the calm air soon arose the sound</span><br />
Of one old voice as now a Wanderer spoke.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>"O friends, and ye, fair loving gentle folk,<br />
Would I could better tell a tale to-day;<br />
But hark to this, which while our good ship lay<br />
Within the Weser such a while agone,<br />
A Fleming told me, as we sat alone<br />
One Sunday evening in the Rose-garland,<br />
And all the other folk were gone a-land<br />
After their pleasure, like sea-faring men.<br />
Surely I deem it no great wonder then<br />
That I remember everything he said,<br />
Since from that Sunday eve strange fortune led<br />
That keel and me on such a weary way&mdash;<br />
Well, at the least it serveth you to-day."</p></div>

<h2>THE LADY OF THE LAND.</h2>

<h3>ARGUMENT.</h3>

<p class="hang">A certain man having landed on an island in the Greek Sea found there
a beautiful damsel, whom he would fain have delivered from a strange
and dreadful doom, but failing herein, he died soon afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">I</span><span class="caps">t</span> happened once, some men of Italy</span><br />
Midst the Greek Islands went a sea-roving,<br />
And much good fortune had they on the sea:<br />
Of many a man they had the ransoming,<br />
And many a chain they gat, and goodly thing;<br />
And midst their voyage to an isle they came,<br />
Whereof my story keepeth not the name.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now though but little was there left to gain,</span><br />
Because the richer folk had gone away,<br />
Yet since by this of water they were fain<br />
They came to anchor in a land-locked bay,<br />
Whence in a while some went ashore to play,<br />
Going but lightly armed in twos or threes,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>For midst that folk they feared no enemies.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of these fellows that thus went ashore,</span><br />
One was there who left all his friends behind;<br />
Who going inland ever more and more,<br />
And being left quite alone, at last did find<br />
A lonely valley sheltered from the wind,<br />
Wherein, amidst an ancient cypress wood,<br />
A long-deserted ruined castle stood.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wood, once ordered in fair grove and glade,</span><br />
With gardens overlooked by terraces,<br />
And marble-pav&eacute;d pools for pleasure made,<br />
Was tangled now, and choked with fallen trees;<br />
And he who went there, with but little ease<br />
Must stumble by the stream's side, once made meet<br />
For tender women's dainty wandering feet.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The raven's croak, the low wind choked and drear,</span><br />
The baffled stream, the grey wolf's doleful cry,<br />
Were all the sounds that mariner could hear,<br />
As through the wood he wandered painfully;<br />
But as unto the house he drew anigh,<br />
The pillars of a ruined shrine he saw,<br />
The once fair temple of a fallen law.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No image was there left behind to tell</span><br />
Before whose face the knees of men had bowed;<br />
An altar of black stone, of old wrought well,<br />
Alone beneath a ruined roof now showed<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>The goal whereto the folk were wont to crowd,<br />
Seeking for things forgotten long ago,<br />
Praying for heads long ages laid a-low.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Close to the temple was the castle-gate,</span><br />
Doorless and crumbling; there our fellow turned,<br />
Trembling indeed at what might chance to wait<br />
The prey entrapped, yet with a heart that burned<br />
To know the most of what might there be learned,<br />
And hoping somewhat too, amid his fear,<br />
To light on such things as all men hold dear.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Noble the house was, nor seemed built for war,</span><br />
But rather like the work of other days,<br />
When men, in better peace than now they are,<br />
Had leisure on the world around to gaze,<br />
And noted well the past times' changing ways;<br />
And fair with sculptured stories it was wrought,<br />
By lapse of time unto dim ruin brought.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now as he looked about on all these things,</span><br />
And strove to read the mouldering histories,<br />
Above the door an image with wide wings,<br />
Whose unclad limbs a serpent seemed to seize,<br />
He dimly saw, although the western breeze,<br />
And years of biting frost and washing rain,<br />
Had made the carver's labour well-nigh vain.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But this, though perished sore, and worn away,</span><br />
He noted well, because it seemed to be,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>After the fashion of another day,<br />
Some great man's badge of war, or armoury,<br />
And round it a carved wreath he seemed to see;<br />
But taking note of these things, at the last<br />
The mariner beneath the gateway passed.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there a lovely cloistered court he found,</span><br />
A fountain in the midst o'erthrown and dry,<br />
And in the cloister briers twining round<br />
The slender shafts; the wondrous imagery<br />
Outworn by more than many years gone by,<br />
Because the country people, in their fear<br />
Of wizardry, had wrought destruction here;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And piteously these fair things had been maimed;</span><br />
There stood great Jove, lacking his head of might;<br />
Here was the archer, swift Apollo, lamed;<br />
The shapely limbs of Venus hid from sight<br />
By weeds and shards; Diana's ankles light<br />
Bound with the cable of some coasting ship;<br />
And rusty nails through Helen's maddening lip.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therefrom unto the chambers did he pass,</span><br />
And found them fair still, midst of their decay,<br />
Though in them now no sign of man there was,<br />
And everything but stone had passed away<br />
That made them lovely in that vanished day;<br />
Nay, the mere walls themselves would soon be gone<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>And nought be left but heaps of mouldering stone.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he, when all the place he had gone o'er.</span><br />
And with much trouble clomb the broken stair,<br />
And from the topmost turret seen the shore<br />
And his good ship drawn up at anchor there,<br />
Came down again, and found a crypt most fair<br />
Built wonderfully beneath the greatest hall,<br />
And there he saw a door within the wall,<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well-hinged, close shut; nor was there in that place</span><br />
Another on its hinges, therefore he<br />
Stood there and pondered for a little space,<br />
And thought, "Perchance some marvel I shall see,<br />
For surely here some dweller there must be,<br />
Because this door seems whole, and new, and sound.<br />
While nought but ruin I can see around."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So with that word, moved by a strong desire,</span><br />
He tried the hasp, that yielded to his hand,<br />
And in a strange place, lit as by a fire<br />
Unseen but near, he presently did stand;<br />
And by an odorous breeze his face was fanned,<br />
As though in some Arabian plain he stood,<br />
Anigh the border of a spice-tree wood.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He moved not for awhile, but looking round,</span><br />
He wondered much to see the place so fair,<br />
Because, unlike the castle above ground,<br />
No pillager or wrecker had been there;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>It seemed that time had passed on otherwhere,<br />
Nor laid a finger on this hidden place,<br />
Rich with the wealth of some forgotten race.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With hangings, fresh as when they left the loom,</span><br />
The walls were hung a space above the head,<br />
Slim ivory chairs were set about the room,<br />
And in one corner was a dainty bed,<br />
That seemed for some fair queen apparell&eacute;d;<br />
And marble was the worst stone of the floor,<br />
That with rich Indian webs was covered o'er.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wanderer trembled when he saw all this,</span><br />
Because he deemed by magic it was wrought;<br />
Yet in his heart a longing for some bliss,<br />
Whereof the hard and changing world knows nought,<br />
Arose and urged him on, and dimmed the thought<br />
That there perchance some devil lurked to slay<br />
The heedless wanderer from the light of day.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over against him was another door</span><br />
Set in the wall, so, casting fear aside,<br />
With hurried steps he crossed the varied floor,<br />
And there again the silver latch he tried<br />
And with no pain the door he opened wide,<br />
And entering the new chamber cautiously<br />
The glory of great heaps of gold could see.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the floor uncounted medals lay,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>Like things of little value; here and there<br />
Stood golden caldrons, that might well outweigh<br />
The biggest midst an emperor's copper-ware,<br />
And golden cups were set on tables fair,<br />
Themselves of gold; and in all hollow things<br />
Were stored great gems, worthy the crowns of kings.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The walls and roof with gold were overlaid,</span><br />
And precious raiment from the wall hung down;<br />
The fall of kings that treasure might have stayed,<br />
Or gained some longing conqueror great renown,<br />
Or built again some god-destroyed old town;<br />
What wonder, if this plunderer of the sea<br />
Stood gazing at it long and dizzily?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But at the last his troubled eyes and dazed</span><br />
He lifted from the glory of that gold,<br />
And then the image, that well-nigh erased<br />
Over the castle-gate he did behold,<br />
Above a door well wrought in coloured gold<br />
Again he saw; a naked girl with wings<br />
Enfolded in a serpent's scaly rings.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And even as his eyes were fixed on it</span><br />
A woman's voice came from the other side,<br />
And through his heart strange hopes began to flit<br />
That in some wondrous land he might abide<br />
Not dying, master of a deathless bride,<br />
So o'er the gold which now he scarce could see<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>He went, and passed this last door eagerly.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then in a room he stood wherein there was</span><br />
A marble bath, whose brimming water yet<br />
Was scarcely still; a vessel of green glass<br />
Half full of odorous ointment was there set<br />
Upon the topmost step that still was wet,<br />
And jewelled shoes and women's dainty gear,<br />
Lay cast upon the varied pavement near.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In one quick glance these things his eyes did see,</span><br />
But speedily they turned round to behold<br />
Another sight, for throned on ivory<br />
There sat a woman, whose wet tresses rolled<br />
On to the floor in waves of gleaming gold,<br />
Cast back from such a form as, erewhile shown<br />
To one poor shepherd, lighted up Troy town.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Naked she was, the kisses of her feet</span><br />
Upon the floor a dying path had made<br />
From the full bath unto her ivory seat;<br />
In her right hand, upon her bosom laid,<br />
She held a golden comb, a mirror weighed<br />
Her left hand down, aback her fair head lay<br />
Dreaming awake of some long vanished day.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her eyes were shut, but she seemed not to sleep,</span><br />
Her lips were murmuring things unheard and low,<br />
Or sometimes twitched as though she needs must weep<br />
Though from her eyes the tears refused to flow,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>And oft with heavenly red her cheek did glow,<br />
As if remembrance of some half-sweet shame<br />
Across the web of many memories came.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There stood the man, scarce daring to draw breath</span><br />
For fear the lovely sight should fade away;<br />
Forgetting heaven, forgetting life and death,<br />
Trembling for fear lest something he should say<br />
Unwitting, lest some sob should yet betray<br />
His presence there, for to his eager eyes<br />
Already did the tears begin to rise.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as he gazed she moved, and with a sigh</span><br />
Bent forward, dropping down her golden head;<br />
"Alas, alas! another day gone by,<br />
Another day and no soul come," she said;<br />
"Another year, and still I am not dead!"<br />
And with that word once more her head she raised,<br />
And on the trembling man with great eyes gazed.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then he imploring hands to her did reach,</span><br />
And toward her very slowly 'gan to move<br />
And with wet eyes her pity did beseech,<br />
And seeing her about to speak he strove<br />
From trembling lips to utter words of love;<br />
But with a look she stayed his doubtful feet,<br />
And made sweet music as their eyes did meet.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For now she spoke in gentle voice and clear,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>Using the Greek tongue that he knew full well;<br />
"What man art thou, that thus hast wandered here.<br />
And found this lonely chamber where I dwell?<br />
Beware, beware! for I have many a spell;<br />
If greed of power and gold have led thee on,<br />
Not lightly shall this untold wealth be won.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But if thou com'st here, knowing of my tale,</span><br />
In hope to bear away my body fair,<br />
Stout must thine heart be, nor shall that avail<br />
If thou a wicked soul in thee dost bear;<br />
So once again I bid thee to beware,<br />
Because no base man things like this may see,<br />
And live thereafter long and happily."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Lady," he said, "in Florence is my home,</span><br />
And in my city noble is my name;<br />
Neither on peddling voyage am I come,<br />
But, like my fathers, bent to gather fame;<br />
And though thy face has set my heart a-flame<br />
Yet of thy story nothing do I know,<br />
But here have wandered heedlessly enow.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But since the sight of thee mine eyes did bless,</span><br />
What can I be but thine? what wouldst thou have?<br />
From those thy words, I deem from some distress<br />
By deeds of mine thy dear life I might save;<br />
O then, delay not! if one ever gave<br />
His life to any, mine I give to thee;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>Come, tell me what the price of love must be?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Swift death, to be with thee a day and night</span><br />
And with the earliest dawning to be slain?<br />
Or better, a long year of great delight,<br />
And many years of misery and pain?<br />
Or worse, and this poor hour for all my gain?<br />
A sorry merchant am I on this day,<br />
E'en as thou wiliest so must I obey."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She said, "What brave words! nought divine am I,</span><br />
But an unhappy and unheard-of maid<br />
Compelled by evil fate and destiny<br />
To live, who long ago should have been laid<br />
Under the earth within the cypress shade.<br />
Hearken awhile, and quickly shalt thou know<br />
What deed I pray thee to accomplish now.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"God grant indeed thy words are not for nought!</span><br />
Then shalt thou save me, since for many a day<br />
To such a dreadful life I have been brought:<br />
Nor will I spare with all my heart to pay<br />
What man soever takes my grief away;<br />
Ah! I will love thee, if thou lovest me<br />
But well enough my saviour now to be.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"My father lived a many years agone</span><br />
Lord of this land, master of all cunning,<br />
Who ruddy gold could draw from out grey stone,<br />
And gather wealth from many an uncouth thing,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>He made the wilderness rejoice and sing,<br />
And such a leech he was that none could say<br />
Without his word what soul should pass away.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Unto Diana such a gift he gave,</span><br />
Goddess above, below, and on the earth,<br />
That I should be her virgin and her slave<br />
From the first hour of my most wretched birth;<br />
Therefore my life had known but little mirth<br />
When I had come unto my twentieth year<br />
And the last time of hallowing drew anear.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"So in her temple had I lived and died</span><br />
And all would long ago have passed away,<br />
But ere that time came, did strange things betide,<br />
Whereby I am alive unto this day;<br />
Alas, the bitter words that I must say!<br />
Ah! can I bring my wretched tongue to tell<br />
How I was brought unto this fearful hell.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"A queen I was, what gods I knew I loved,</span><br />
And nothing evil was there in my thought,<br />
And yet by love my wretched heart was moved<br />
Until to utter ruin I was brought!<br />
Alas! thou sayest our gods were vain and nought,<br />
Wait, wait, till thou hast heard this tale of mine.<br />
Then shalt thou think them devilish or divine.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Hearken! in spite of father and of vow</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>I loved a man; but for that sin I think<br />
Men had forgiven me&mdash;yea, yea, even thou;<br />
But from the gods the full cup must I drink,<br />
And into misery unheard of sink,<br />
Tormented when their own names are forgot,<br />
And men must doubt e'er if they lived or not.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Glorious my lover was unto my sight,</span><br />
Most beautiful,&mdash;of love we grew so fain<br />
That we at last agreed, that on a night<br />
We should be happy, but that he were slain<br />
Or shut in hold, and neither joy nor pain<br />
Should else forbid that hoped-for time to be;<br />
So came the night that made a wretch of me.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ah I well do I remember all that night,</span><br />
When through the window shone the orb of June,<br />
And by the bed flickered the taper's light,<br />
Whereby I trembled, gazing at the moon:<br />
Ah me! the meeting that we had, when soon<br />
Into his strong, well-trusted arms I fell,<br />
And many a sorrow we began to tell.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ah me I what parting on that night we had!</span><br />
I think the story of my great despair<br />
A little while might merry folk make sad;<br />
For, as he swept away my yellow hair<br />
To make my shoulder and my bosom bare,<br />
I raised mine eyes, and shuddering could behold<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>A shadow cast upon the bed of gold:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Then suddenly was quenched my hot desire</span><br />
And he untwined his arms; the moon so pale<br />
A while ago, seemed changed to blood and fire,<br />
And yet my limbs beneath me did not fail,<br />
And neither had I strength to cry or wail,<br />
But stood there helpless, bare, and shivering,<br />
With staring eyes still fixed upon the thing.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Because the shade that on the bed of gold</span><br />
The changed and dreadful moon was throwing down<br />
Was of Diana, whom I did behold,<br />
With knotted hair, and shining girt-up gown,<br />
And on the high white brow, a deadly frown<br />
Bent upon us, who stood scarce drawing breath,<br />
Striving to meet the horrible sure death.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"No word at all the dreadful goddess said,</span><br />
But soon across my feet my lover lay,<br />
And well indeed I knew that he was dead;<br />
And would that I had died on that same day!<br />
For in a while the image turned away,<br />
And without words my doom I understood,<br />
And felt a horror change my human blood.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And there I fell, and on the floor I lay</span><br />
By the dead man, till daylight came on me,<br />
And not a word thenceforward could I say<br />
For three years, till of grief and misery,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>The lingering pest, the cruel enemy,<br />
My father and his folk were dead and gone,<br />
And in this castle I was left alone:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And then the doom foreseen upon me fell,</span><br />
For Queen Diana did my body change<br />
Into a fork-tongued dragon flesh and fell,<br />
And through the island nightly do I range,<br />
Or in the green sea mate with monsters strange,<br />
When in the middle of the moonlit night<br />
The sleepy mariner I do affright.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But all day long upon this gold I lie</span><br />
Within this place, where never mason's hand<br />
Smote trowel on the marble noisily;<br />
Drowsy I lie, no folk at my command,<br />
Who once was called the Lady of the Land;<br />
Who might have bought a kingdom with a kiss,<br />
Yea, half the world with such a sight as this."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And therewithal, with rosy fingers light,</span><br />
Backward her heavy-hanging hair she threw,<br />
To give her naked beauty more to sight;<br />
But when, forgetting all the things he knew,<br />
Maddened with love unto the prize he drew,<br />
She cried, "Nay, wait! for wherefore wilt thou die,<br />
Why should we not be happy, thou and I?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Wilt thou not save me? once in every year</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>This rightful form of mine that thou dost see<br />
By favour of the goddess have I here<br />
From sunrise unto sunset given me,<br />
That some brave man may end my misery.<br />
And thou&mdash;art thou not brave? can thy heart fail,<br />
Whose eyes e'en now are weeping at my tale?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Then listen! when this day is overpast,</span><br />
A fearful monster shall I be again,<br />
And thou mayst be my saviour at the last,<br />
Unless, once more, thy words are nought and vain;<br />
If thou of love and sovereignty art fain,<br />
Come thou next morn, and when thou seest here<br />
A hideous dragon, have thereof no fear,<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But take the loathsome head up in thine hands,</span><br />
And kiss it, and be master presently<br />
Of twice the wealth that is in all the lands,<br />
From Cathay to the head of Italy;<br />
And master also, if it pleaseth thee,<br />
Of all thou praisest as so fresh and bright,<br />
Of what thou callest crown of all delight.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ah! with what joy then shall I see again</span><br />
The sunlight on the green grass and the trees,<br />
And hear the clatter of the summer rain,<br />
And see the joyous folk beyond the seas.<br />
Ah, me! to hold my child upon my knees,<br />
After the weeping of unkindly tears,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>And all the wrongs of these four hundred years.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Go now, go quick! leave this grey heap of stone;</span><br />
And from thy glad heart think upon thy way,<br />
How I shall love thee&mdash;yea, love thee alone,<br />
That bringest me from dark death unto day;<br />
For this shall be thy wages and thy pay;<br />
Unheard-of wealth, unheard-of love is near,<br />
If thou hast heart a little dread to bear."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therewith she turned to go; but he cried out,</span><br />
"Ah! wilt thou leave me then without one kiss,<br />
To slay the very seeds of fear and doubt,<br />
That glad to-morrow may bring certain bliss?<br />
Hast thou forgotten how love lives by this,<br />
The memory of some hopeful close embrace,<br />
Low whispered words within some lonely place?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But she, when his bright glittering eyes she saw,</span><br />
And burning cheeks, cried out, "Alas, alas!<br />
Must I be quite undone, and wilt thou draw<br />
A worse fate on me than the first one was?<br />
O haste thee from this fatal place to pass!<br />
Yet, ere thou goest, take this, lest thou shouldst deem<br />
Thou hast been fooled by some strange midday dream."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So saying, blushing like a new-kissed maid,</span><br />
From off her neck a little gem she drew,<br />
That, 'twixt those snowy rose-tinged hillocks laid,<br />
The secrets of her glorious beauty knew;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>And ere he well perceived what she would do,<br />
She touched his hand, the gem within it lay,<br />
And, turning, from his sight she fled away.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then at the doorway where her rosy heel</span><br />
Had glanced and vanished, he awhile did stare,<br />
And still upon his hand he seemed to feel<br />
The varying kisses of her fingers fair;<br />
Then turned he toward the dreary crypt and bare,<br />
And dizzily throughout the castle passed,<br />
Till by the ruined fane he stood at last.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then weighing still the gem within his hand,</span><br />
He stumbled backward through the cypress wood,<br />
Thinking the while of some strange lovely land,<br />
Where all his life should be most fair and good;<br />
Till on the valley's wall of hills he stood,<br />
And slowly thence passed down unto the bay<br />
Red with the death of that bewildering day.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">T</span><span class="caps">he</span> next day came, and he, who all the night</span><br />
Had ceaselessly been turning in his bed,<br />
Arose and clad himself in armour bright,<br />
And many a danger he remember&eacute;d;<br />
Storming of towns, lone sieges full of dread,<br />
That with renown his heart had borne him through,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>And this thing seemed a little thing to do.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So on he went, and on the way he thought</span><br />
Of all the glorious things of yesterday,<br />
Nought of the price whereat they must be bought,<br />
But ever to himself did softly say,<br />
"No roaming now, my wars are passed away,<br />
No long dull days devoid of happiness,<br />
When such a love my yearning heart shall bless."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus to the castle did he come at last,</span><br />
But when unto the gateway he drew near,<br />
And underneath its ruined archway passed<br />
Into the court, a strange noise did he hear,<br />
And through his heart there shot a pang of fear,<br />
Trembling, he gat his sword into his hand,<br />
And midmost of the cloisters took his stand.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But for a while that unknown noise increased</span><br />
A rattling, that with strident roars did blend,<br />
And whining moans; but suddenly it ceased,<br />
A fearful thing stood at the cloister's end,<br />
And eyed him for a while, then 'gan to wend<br />
Adown the cloisters, and began again<br />
That rattling, and the moan like fiends in pain.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as it came on towards him, with its teeth</span><br />
The body of a slain goat did it tear,<br />
The blood whereof in its hot jaws did seethe,<br />
And on its tongue he saw the smoking hair;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>Then his heart sank, and standing trembling there,<br />
Throughout his mind wild thoughts and fearful ran,<br />
"Some fiend she was," he said, "the bane of man."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet he abode her still, although his blood</span><br />
Curdled within him: the thing dropped the goat,<br />
And creeping on, came close to where he stood,<br />
And raised its head to him, and wrinkled throat,<br />
Then he cried out and wildly at her smote,<br />
Shutting his eyes, and turned and from the place<br />
Ran swiftly, with a white and ghastly face.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But little things rough stones and tree-trunks seemed,</span><br />
And if he fell, he rose and ran on still;<br />
No more he felt his hurts than if he dreamed,<br />
He made no stay for valley or steep hill,<br />
Heedless he dashed through many a foaming rill,<br />
Until he came unto the ship at last<br />
And with no word into the deep hold passed.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Meanwhile the dragon, seeing him clean gone.</span><br />
Followed him not, but crying horribly,<br />
Caught up within her jaws a block of stone<br />
And ground it into powder, then turned she,<br />
With cries that folk could hear far out at sea,<br />
And reached the treasure set apart of old,<br />
To brood above the hidden heaps of gold.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet was she seen again on many a day</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>By some half-waking mariner, or herd,<br />
Playing amid the ripples of the bay,<br />
Or on the hills making all things afeard,<br />
Or in the wood, that did that castle gird,<br />
But never any man again durst go<br />
To seek her woman's form, and end her woe.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As for the man, who knows what things he bore?</span><br />
What mournful faces peopled the sad night,<br />
What wailings vexed him with reproaches sore,<br />
What images of that nigh-gained delight!<br />
What dreamed caresses from soft hands and white,<br />
Turning to horrors ere they reached the best,<br />
What struggles vain, what shame, what huge unrest?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No man he knew, three days he lay and raved,</span><br />
And cried for death, until a lethargy<br />
Fell on him, and his fellows thought him saved;<br />
But on the third night he awoke to die;<br />
And at Byzantium doth his body lie<br />
Between two blossoming pomegranate trees,<br />
Within the churchyard of the Genoese.</p></div>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">A</span> <span class="caps">moment's</span> silence as his tale had end,</span><br />
And then the wind of that June night did blend<br />
Their varied voices, as of that and this<br />
They fell to talk: of those fair islands' bliss<br />
They knew in other days, of hope they had<br />
To live there long an easy life and glad,<br />
With nought to vex them; and the younger men<br />
Began to nourish strange dreams even then<br />
Of sailing east, as these had once sailed west;<br />
Because the story of that luckless quest<br />
With hope, not fear, had filled their joyous hearts<br />
And made them dream of new and noble parts<br />
That they might act; of raising up the name<br />
Their fathers bore, and winning boundless fame.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These too with little patience seemed to hear,</span><br />
That story end with shame and grief and fear;<br />
A little thing the man had had to do,<br />
They said, if longing burned within him so.<br />
But at their words the older men must bow<br />
Their heads, and, smiling, somewhat thoughtful grow,<br />
Remembering well how fear in days gone by<br />
Had dealt with them, and poisoned wretchedly<br />
Good days, good deeds, and longings for all good:<br />
Yet on the evil times they would not brood,<br />
But sighing, strove to raise the weight of years,<br />
And no more memory of their hopes and fears<br />
They nourished, but such gentle thoughts as fed<br />
The pensiveness which that sweet season bred.</p></div>

And thine eyes shone with joyous memories;<br />
Fair was the early morn, and fair wert thou,<br />
And I was happy&mdash;Ah, be happy now!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peace and content without us, love within</span><br />
That hour there was, now thunder and wild rain,<br />
Have wrapped the cowering world, and foolish sin,<br />

Can we regain what we have lost meanwhile?<br />

<h2>THE SON OF CR&OElig;SUS.</h2>

<h3>ARGUMENT.</h3>

<p class="hang">Cr&oelig;sus, King of Lydia, dreamed that he saw his son slain by an iron
weapon, and though by every means he strove to avert this doom from
him, yet thus it happened, for his son was slain by the hand of the
man who seemed least of all likely to do the deed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">O</span><span class="caps">f</span> Cr&oelig;sus tells my tale, a king of old</span><br />
In Lydia, ere the Mede fell on the land,<br />
A man made mighty by great heaps of gold,<br />
Feared for the myriads strong of heart and hand<br />
That 'neath his banners wrought out his command,<br />
And though his latter ending happed on ill,<br />
Yet first of every joy he had his fill.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Two sons he had, and one was dumb from birth;</span><br />
The other one, that Atys had to name,<br />
Grew up a fair youth, and of might and worth,<br />
And well it seemed the race wherefrom he came<br />
From him should never get reproach or shame:<br />
But yet no stroke he struck before his death,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>In no war-shout he spent his latest breath.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now Cr&oelig;sus, lying on his bed anight</span><br />
Dreamed that he saw this dear son laid a-low,<br />
And folk lamenting he was slain outright,<br />
And that some iron thing had dealt the blow;<br />
By whose hand guided he could nowise know,<br />
Or if in peace by traitors it were done,<br />
Or in some open war not yet begun.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Three times one night this vision broke his sleep,</span><br />
So that at last he rose up from his bed,<br />
That he might ponder how he best might keep<br />
The threatened danger from so dear a head;<br />
And, since he now was old enough to wed,<br />
The King sent men to search the lands around,<br />
Until some matchless maiden should be found;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That in her arms this Atys might forget</span><br />
The praise of men, and fame of history,<br />
Whereby full many a field has been made wet<br />
With blood of men, and many a deep green sea<br />
Been reddened therewithal, and yet shall be;<br />
That her sweet voice might drown the people's praise,<br />
Her eyes make bright the uneventful days.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So when at last a wonder they had brought,</span><br />
From some sweet land down by the ocean's rim.<br />
Than whom no fairer could by man be thought,<br />
And ancient dames, scanning her limb by limb,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>Had said that she was fair enough for him,<br />
To her was Atys married with much show,<br />
And looked to dwell with her in bliss enow.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in meantime afield he never went,</span><br />
Either to hunting or the frontier war,<br />
No dart was cast, nor any engine bent<br />
Anigh him, and the Lydian men afar<br />
Must rein their steeds, and the bright blossoms mar<br />
If they have any lust of tourney now,<br />
And in far meadows must they bend the bow.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And also through the palace everywhere</span><br />
The swords and spears were taken from the wall<br />
That long with honour had been hanging there,<br />
And from the golden pillars of the hall;<br />
Lest by mischance some sacred blade should fall,<br />
And in its falling bring revenge at last<br />
For many a fatal battle overpast.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And every day King Cr&oelig;sus wrought with care</span><br />
To save his dear son from that threatened end,<br />
And many a beast he offered up with prayer<br />
Unto the gods, and much of wealth did spend,<br />
That they so prayed might yet perchance defend<br />
That life, until at least that he were dead,<br />
With earth laid heavy on his unseeing head.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But in the midst even of the wedding feast</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>There came a man, who by the golden hall<br />
Sat down upon the steps, and man or beast<br />
He heeded not, but there against the wall<br />
He leaned his head, speaking no word at all,<br />
Till, with his son and son's wife, came the King,<br />
And then unto his gown the man did cling.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What man art thou?" the King said to him then,</span><br />
"That in such guise thou prayest on thy knee;<br />
Hast thou some fell foe here among my men?<br />
Or hast thou done an ill deed unto me?<br />
Or has thy wife been carried over sea?<br />
Or hast thou on this day great need of gold?<br />
Or say, why else thou now art grown so bold."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O King," he said, "I ask no gold to-day,</span><br />
And though indeed thy greatness drew me here,<br />
No wrong have I that thou couldst wipe away;<br />
And nought of mine the pirate folk did bear<br />
Across the sea; none of thy folk I fear:<br />
But all the gods are now mine enemies,<br />
Therefore I kneel before thee on my knees.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For as with mine own brother on a day</span><br />
Within the running place at home I played,<br />
Unwittingly I smote him such-a-way<br />
That dead upon the green grass he was laid;<br />
Half-dead myself I fled away dismayed,<br />
Wherefore I pray thee help me in my need,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>And purify my soul of this sad deed.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"If of my name and country thou wouldst know,</span><br />
In Phrygia yet my father is a king,<br />
Gordius, the son of Midas, rich enow<br />
In corn and cattle, golden cup and ring;<br />
And mine own name before I did this thing<br />
Was called Adrastus, whom, in street and hall,<br />
The slayer of his brother men now call."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Friend," said the King, "have thou no fear of me;</span><br />
For though, indeed, I am right happy now,<br />
Yet well I know this may not always be,<br />
And I may chance some day to kneel full low,<br />
And to some happy man mine head to bow<br />
With prayers to do a greater thing than this,<br />
Dwell thou with us, and win again thy bliss.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For in this city men in sport and play</span><br />
Forget the trouble that the gods have sent;<br />
Who therewithal send wine, and many a may<br />
As fair as she for whom the Trojan went,<br />
And many a dear delight besides have lent,<br />
Which, whoso is well loved of them shall keep<br />
Till in forgetful death he falls asleep.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Therefore to-morrow shall those rites be done</span><br />
That kindred blood demands that thou hast shed,<br />
That if the mouth of thine own mother's son<br />
Did hap to curse thee ere he was quite dead,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>The curse may lie the lighter on thine head,<br />
Because the flower-crowned head of many a beast<br />
Has fallen voiceless in our glorious feast."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then did Adrastus rise and thank the King,</span><br />
And the next day when yet low was the sun,<br />
The sacrifice and every other thing<br />
That unto these dread rites belonged, was done;<br />
And there Adrastus dwelt, hated of none,<br />
And loved of many, and the King loved him,<br />
For brave and wise he was and strong of limb.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But chiefly amongst all did Atys love</span><br />
The luckless stranger, whose fair tales of war<br />
The Lydian's heart abundantly did move,<br />
And much they talked of wandering out afar<br />
Some day, to lands where many marvels are,<br />
With still the Phrygian through all things to be<br />
The leader unto all felicity.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now at this time folk came unto the King</span><br />
Who on a forest's borders dwelling were,<br />
Wherein there roamed full many a dangerous thing,<br />
As wolf and wild bull, lion and brown bear;<br />
But chiefly in that forest was the lair<br />
Of a great boar that no man could withstand.<br />
And many a woe he wrought upon the land.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since long ago that men in Calydon</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>Held chase, no beast like him had once been seen<br />
He ruined vineyards lying in the sun,<br />
After his harvesting the men must glean<br />
What he had left; right glad they had not been<br />
Among the tall stalks of the ripening wheat,<br />
The fell destroyer's fatal tusks to meet.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For often would the lonely man entrapped</span><br />
In vain from his dire fury strive to hide<br />
In some thick hedge, and other whiles it happed<br />
Some careless stranger by his place would ride,<br />
And the tusks smote his fallen horse's side,<br />
And what help then to such a wretch could come<br />
With sword he could not draw, and far from home?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or else girls, sent their water-jars to fill,</span><br />
Would come back pale, too terrified to cry,<br />
Because they had but seen him from the hill;<br />
Or else again with side rent wretchedly,<br />
Some hapless damsel midst the brake would lie.<br />
Shortly to say, there neither man nor maid<br />
Was safe afield whether they wrought or played.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therefore were come these dwellers by the wood</span><br />
To pray the King brave men to them to send,<br />
That they might live; and if he deemed it good,<br />
That Atys with the other knights should wend,<br />
They thought their grief the easier should have end;<br />
For both by gods and men they knew him loved,<br />
And easily by hope of glory moved.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O Sire," they said, "thou know'st how Hercules</span><br />
Was not content to wait till folk asked aid,<br />
But sought the pests among their guarded trees;<br />
Thou know'st what name the Theban Cadmus made,<br />
And how the bull of Marathon was laid<br />
Dead on the fallows of the Athenian land,<br />
And how folk worshipped Atalanta's hand.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Fair would thy son's name look upon the roll</span><br />
Wherein such noble deeds as this are told;<br />
And great delight shall surely fill thy soul,<br />
Thinking upon his deeds when thou art old,<br />
And thy brave heart is waxen faint and cold:<br />
Dost thou not know, O King, how men will strive<br />
That they, when dead, still in their sons may live?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He shuddered as they spoke, because he thought,</span><br />
Most certainly a winning tale is this<br />
To draw him from the net where he is caught,<br />
For hearts of men grow weary of all bliss;<br />
Nor is he one to be content with his,<br />
If he should hear the trumpet-blast of fame<br />
And far-off people calling on his name.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Good friends," he said, "go, get ye back again.</span><br />
And doubt not I will send you men to slay<br />
This pest ye fear: yet shall your prayer be vain<br />
If ye with any other speak to-day;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>And for my son, with me he needs must stay,<br />
For mighty cares oppress the Lydian land.<br />
Fear not, for ye shall have a noble band."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with that promise must they be content,</span><br />
And so departed, having feasted well.<br />
And yet some god or other ere they went,<br />
If they were silent, this their tale must tell<br />
To more than one man; therefore it befell,<br />
That at the last Prince Atys knew the thing,<br />
And came with angry eyes unto the King.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Father," he said, "since when am I grown vile</span><br />
Since when am I grown helpless of my hands?<br />
Or else what folk, with words enwrought with guile<br />
Thine ears have poisoned; that when far-off lands<br />
My fame might fill, by thy most strange commands<br />
I needs must stay within this slothful home,<br />
Whereto would God that I had never come?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What! wilt thou take mine honour quite away</span><br />
Wouldst thou, that, as with her I just have wed<br />
I sit among thy folk at end of day,<br />
She should be ever turning round her head<br />
To watch some man for war apparelled<br />
Because he wears a sword that he may use,<br />
Which grace to me thou ever wilt refuse?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Or dost thou think, when thou hast run thy race</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>And thou art gone, and in thy stead I reign,<br />
The people will do honour to my place,<br />
Or that the lords leal men will still remain,<br />
If yet my father's sword be sharp in vain?<br />
If on the wall his armour still hang up,<br />
While for a spear I hold a drinking-cup?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O Son!" quoth Cr&oelig;sus, "well I know thee brave</span><br />
And worthy of high deeds of chivalry;<br />
Therefore the more thy dear life would I save,<br />
Which now is threatened by the gods on high;<br />
Three times one night I dreamed I saw thee die,<br />
Slain by some deadly iron-pointed thing,<br />
While weeping lords stood round thee in a ring."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then loud laughed Atys, and he said again,</span><br />
"Father, and did this ugly dream tell thee<br />
What day it was on which I should be slain?<br />
As may the gods grant I may one day be,<br />
And not from sickness die right wretchedly,<br />
Groaning with pain, my lords about my bed,<br />
Wishing to God that I were fairly dead;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But slain in battle, as the Lydian kings</span><br />
Have died ere now, in some great victory,<br />
While all about the Lydian shouting rings<br />
Death to the beaten foemen as they fly.<br />
What death but this, O father! should I die?<br />
But if my life by iron shall be done,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>What steel to-day shall glitter in the sun?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yea, father, if to thee it seemeth good</span><br />
To keep me from the bright steel-bearing throng,<br />
Let me be brave at least within the wood;<br />
For surely, if thy dream be true, no wrong<br />
Can hap to me from this beast's tushes strong:<br />
Unless perchance the beast is grown so wise,<br />
He haunts the forest clad in Lydian guise."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Cr&oelig;sus said: "O Son, I love thee so,</span><br />
That thou shalt do thy will upon this tide:<br />
But since unto this hunting thou must go,<br />
A trusty friend along with thee shall ride,<br />
Who not for anything shall leave thy side.<br />
I think, indeed, he loves thee well enow<br />
To thrust his heart 'twixt thee and any blow.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Go then, O Son, and if by some short span</span><br />
Thy life be measured, how shall it harm thee,<br />
If while life last thou art a happy man?<br />
And thou art happy; only unto me<br />
Is trembling left, and infelicity:<br />
The trembling of the man who loves on earth,<br />
But unto thee is hope and present mirth.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Nay, be thou not ashamed, for on this day</span><br />
I fear not much: thou read'st my dream aright,<br />
No teeth or claws shall take thy life away.<br />
And it may chance, ere thy last glorious fight,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>I shall be blinded by the endless night;<br />
And brave Adrastus on this day shall be<br />
Thy safeguard, and shall give good heart to me.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Go then, and send him hither, and depart;</span><br />
And as the heroes did so mayst thou do,<br />
Winning such fame as well may please thine heart."<br />
With that word from the King did Atys go,<br />
Who, left behind, sighed, saying, "May it be so,<br />
Even as I hope; and yet I would to God<br />
These men upon my threshold ne'er had trod."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So when Adrastus to the King was come</span><br />
He said unto him, "O my Phrygian friend,<br />
We in this land have given thee a home,<br />
And 'gainst all foes your life will we defend:<br />
Wherefore for us that life thou shouldest spend,<br />
If any day there should be need therefor;<br />
And now a trusty friend I need right sore.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Doubtless ere now thou hast heard many say</span><br />
There is a doom that threatens my son's life;<br />
Therefore this place is stript of arms to-day,<br />
And therefore still bides Atys with his wife,<br />
And tempts not any god by raising strife;<br />
Yet none the less by no desire of his,<br />
To whom would war be most abundant bliss.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And since to-day some glory he may gain</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>Against a monstrous bestial enemy<br />
And that the meaning of my dream is plain;<br />
That saith that he by steel alone shall die,<br />
His burning wish I may not well deny,<br />
Therefore afield to-morrow doth he wend<br />
And herein mayst thou show thyself my friend&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For thou as captain of his band shalt ride,</span><br />
And keep a watchful eye of everything,<br />
Nor leave him whatsoever may betide:<br />
Lo, thou art brave, the son of a great king,<br />
And with thy praises doth this city ring,<br />
Why should I tell thee what a name those gain,<br />
Who dying for their friends, die not in vain?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then said Adrastus, "Now were I grown base</span><br />
Beyond all words, if I should spare for aught<br />
In guarding him, so sit with smiling face,<br />
And of this matter take no further thought,<br />
Because with my life shall his life be bought,<br />
If ill should hap; and no ill fate it were,<br />
If I should die for what I hold so dear."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then went Adrastus, and next morn all things,</span><br />
That 'longed unto the hunting were well dight,<br />
And forth they went clad as the sons of kings,<br />
Fair was the morn, as through the sunshine bright<br />
They rode, the Prince half wild with great delight,<br />
The Phrygian smiling on him soberly,<br />
And ever looking round with watchful eye.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So through the city all the rout rode fast,</span><br />
With many a great black-muzzled yellow hound;<br />
And then the teeming country-side they passed,<br />
Until they came to sour and rugged ground,<br />
And there rode up a little heathy mound,<br />
That overlooked the scrubby woods and low,<br />
That of the beast's lair somewhat they might know.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there a good man of the country-side</span><br />
Showed them the places where he mostly lay;<br />
And they, descending, through the wood did ride,<br />
And followed on his tracks for half the day.<br />
And at the last they brought him well to bay,<br />
Within an oozy space amidst the wood,<br />
About the which a ring of alders stood.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So when the hounds' changed voices clear they heard</span><br />
With hearts aflame on towards him straight they drew<br />
Atys the first of all, of nought afeard,<br />
Except that folk should say some other slew<br />
The beast; and lustily his horn he blew,<br />
Going afoot; then, mighty spear in hand,<br />
Adrastus headed all the following band.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now when they came unto the plot of ground</span><br />
Where stood the boar, hounds dead about him lay<br />
Or sprawled about, bleeding from many a wound,<br />
But still the others held him well at bay,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>Nor had he been bestead thus ere that day.<br />
But yet, seeing Atys, straight he rushed at him,<br />
Speckled with foam, bleeding in flank and limb.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Atys stood and cast his well-steeled spear</span><br />
With a great shout, and straight and well it flew;<br />
For now the broad blade cutting through the ear,<br />
A stream of blood from out the shoulder drew.<br />
And therewithal another, no less true,<br />
Adrastus cast, whereby the boar had died:<br />
But Atys drew the bright sword from his side,<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to the tottering beast he drew anigh:</span><br />
But as the sun's rays ran adown the blade<br />
Adrastus threw a javelin hastily,<br />
For of the mighty beast was he afraid,<br />
Lest by his wounds he should not yet be stayed,<br />
But with a last rush cast his life away,<br />
And dying there, the son of Cr&oelig;sus slay.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But even as the feathered dart he hurled,</span><br />
His strained, despairing eyes, beheld the end,<br />
And changed seemed all the fashion of the world,<br />
And past and future into one did blend,<br />
As he beheld the fixed eyes of his friend,<br />
That no reproach had in them, and no fear,<br />
For Death had seized him ere he thought him near.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Adrastus shrieked, and running up he caught</span><br />
The falling man, and from his bleeding side<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>Drew out the dart, and, seeing that death had brought<br />
Deliverance to him, he thereby had died;<br />
But ere his hand the luckless steel could guide,<br />
And he the refuge of poor souls could win,<br />
The horror-stricken huntsmen had rushed in.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And these, with blows and cries he heeded nought</span><br />
His unresisting hands made haste to bind;<br />
Then of the alder-boughs a bier they wrought,<br />
And laid the corpse thereon, and 'gan to wind<br />
Homeward amidst the tangled wood and blind,<br />
And going slowly, at the eventide,<br />
Some leagues from Sardis did that day abide.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Onward next morn the slaughtered man they bore,</span><br />
With him that slew him, and at end of day<br />
They reached the city, and with mourning sore<br />
Toward the King's palace did they take their way.<br />
He in an open western chamber lay<br />
Feasting, though inwardly his heart did burn<br />
Until that Atys should to him return.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when those wails first smote upon his ear</span><br />
He set the wine-cup down, and to his feet<br />
He rose, and bitter all-consuming fear<br />
Swallowed his joy, and nigh he went to meet<br />
That which was coming through the weeping street;<br />
But in the end he thought it good to wait,<br />
And stood there doubting all the ills of fate.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when at last up to that royal place</span><br />
Folk brought the thing he once had held so dear<br />
Still stood the King, staring with ghastly face<br />
As they brought forth Adrastus and the bier,<br />
But spoke at last, slowly without a tear,<br />
"O Phrygian man, that I did purify,<br />
Is it through thee that Atys came to die?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O King," Adrastus said, "take now my life,</span><br />
With whatso torment seemeth good to thee,<br />
As my word went, for I would end this strife,<br />
And underneath the earth lie quietly;<br />
Nor is it my will here alive to be:<br />
For as my brother, so Prince Atys died,<br />
And this unlucky hand some god did guide."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then as a man constrained, the tale he told</span><br />
From end to end, nor spared himself one whit:<br />
And as he spoke, the wood did still behold,<br />
The trodden grass, and Atys dead on it;<br />
And many a change o'er the King's face did flit<br />
Of kingly rage, and hatred and despair,<br />
As on the slayer's face he still did stare.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last he said, "Thy death avails me nought.</span><br />
The gods themselves have done this bitter deed,<br />
That I was all too happy was their thought,<br />
Therefore thy heart is dead and mine doth bleed,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>And I am helpless as a trodden weed:<br />
Thou art but as the handle of the spear,<br />
The caster sits far off from any fear.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yet, if thy hurt they meant, I can do this,&mdash;</span><br />
&mdash;Loose him and let him go in peace from me&mdash;<br />
I will not slay the slayer of all my bliss;<br />
Yet go, poor man, for when thy face I see<br />
I curse the gods for their felicity.<br />
Surely some other slayer they would have found,<br />
If thou hadst long ago been under ground.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Alas, Adrastus! in my inmost heart</span><br />
I knew the gods would one day do this thing,<br />
But deemed indeed that it would be thy part<br />
To comfort me amidst my sorrowing;<br />
Make haste to go, for I am still a King!<br />
Madness may take me, I have many hands<br />
Who will not spare to do my worst commands."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With that Adrastus' bonds were done away,</span><br />
And forthwith to the city gates he ran,<br />
And on the road where they had been that day<br />
Rushed through the gathering night; and some lone man<br />
Beheld next day his visage wild and wan,<br />
Peering from out a thicket of the wood<br />
Where he had spilt that well-belov&eacute;d blood.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now the day of burial pomp must be,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>And to those rites all lords of Lydia came<br />
About the King, and that day, they and he<br />
Cast royal gifts of rich things on the flame;<br />
But while they stood and wept, and called by name<br />
Upon the dead, amidst them came a man<br />
With raiment rent, and haggard face and wan:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who when the marshals would have thrust him out</span><br />
And men looked strange on him, began to say,<br />
"Surely the world is changed since ye have doubt<br />
Of who I am; nay, turn me not away,<br />
For ye have called me princely ere to-day&mdash;<br />
Adrastus, son of Gordius, a great king,<br />
Where unto Pallas Phrygian maidens sing.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O Lydians, many a rich thing have ye cast</span><br />
Into this flame, but I myself will give<br />
A greater gift, since now I see at last<br />
The gods are wearied for that still I live,<br />
And with their will, why should I longer strive?<br />
Atys, O Atys, thus I give to thee<br />
A life that lived for thy felicity."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And therewith from his side a knife he drew,</span><br />
And, crying out, upon the pile he leapt,<br />
And with one mighty stroke himself he slew.<br />
So there these princes both together slept,<br />
And their light ashes, gathered up, were kept<br />
Within a golden vessel wrought all o'er<br />
With histories of this hunting of the boar.</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">A</span> <span class="caps">gentle</span> wind had risen midst his tale,</span><br />
That bore the sweet scents of the fertile vale<br />
In at the open windows; and these men<br />
The burden of their years scarce noted then,<br />
Soothed by the sweet luxurious summer time,<br />
And by the cadence of that ancient rhyme,<br />
Spite of its saddening import; nay, indeed,<br />
Of some such thoughts the Wanderers had need<br />
As that tale gave them&mdash;Yea, a man shall be<br />
A wonder for his glorious chivalry,<br />
First in all wisdom, of a prudent mind,<br />
Yet none the less him too his fate shall find<br />
Unfenced by these, a man 'mongst other men.<br />
Yea, and will Fortune pick out, now and then,<br />
The noblest for the anvil of her blows;<br />
Great names are few, and yet, indeed, who knows<br />
What greater souls have fallen 'neath the stroke<br />
Of careless fate? Purblind are most of folk,<br />
The happy are the masters of the earth<br />
Which ever give small heed to hapless worth;<br />
So goes the world, and this we needs must bear<br />
Like eld and death: yet there were some men there<br />
Who drank in silence to the memory<br />
Of those who failed on earth great men to be,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>Though better than the men who won the crown.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when the sun was fairly going down</span><br />
They left the house, and, following up the stream,<br />
In the low sun saw the kingfisher gleam<br />
'Twixt bank and alder, and the grebe steal out<br />
From the high sedge, and, in his restless doubt,<br />
Dive down, and rise to see what men were there:<br />
They saw the swallow chase high up in air<br />
The circling gnats; the shaded dusky pool<br />
Broke by the splashing chub; the ripple cool,<br />
Rising and falling, of some distant weir<br />
They heard, till it oppressed the listening ear,<br />
As twilight grew: so back they turned again<br />
Glad of their rest, and pleasure after pain.</p></div>

That now the roses did well-nigh forget,<br />
For hot July was drawing to an end,<br />
And August came the fainting year to mend<br />
With fruit and grain; so 'neath the trellises,<br />
Nigh blossomless, did they lie well at ease,<br />
And watched the poppies burn across the grass,<br />
And o'er the bindweed's bells the brown bee pass<br />
Still murmuring of his gains: windless and bright<br />
The morn had been, to help their dear delight;<br />
But heavy clouds ere noon grew round the sun,<br />
And, halfway to the zenith, wild and dun<br />
The sky grew, and the thunder growled afar;<br />
But, ere the steely clouds began their war,<br />
A change there came, and, as by some great hand,<br />
The clouds that hung in threatening o'er the land<br />
Were drawn away; then a light wind arose<br />
That shook the light stems of that flowery close,<br />
And made men sigh for pleasure; therewithal<br />
Did mirth upon the feasting elders fall,<br />
And they no longer watched the lowering sky,<br />
But called aloud for some new history.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then spoke the Suabian, "Sirs, this tale is told</span><br />
Among our searchers for fine stones and gold,<br />

For I the written book did never see,<br />
Made by some Fleming, as I think, wherein<br />
Is told this tale of wilfulness and sin."</p></div>

<h2>THE WATCHING OF THE FALCON.</h2>

<h3>ARGUMENT.</h3>

<p class="hang">The case of this falcon was such, that whoso watched it without
sleeping for seven days and seven nights, had his first wish granted
him by a fay lady, that appeared to him thereon; and some wished one
thing, and some another. But a certain king, who watched the falcon
daily, would wish for nought but the love of that fay; which wish
being accomplished, was afterwards his ruin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">A</span><span class="caps">cross</span> the sea a land there is,</span><br />
Where, if fate will, may men have bliss,<br />
For it is fair as any land:<br />
There hath the reaper a full hand,<br />
While in the orchard hangs aloft<br />
The purple fig, a-growing soft;<br />
And fair the trellised vine-bunches<br />
Are swung across the high elm-trees;<br />
And in the rivers great fish play,<br />
While over them pass day by day<br />
The laden barges to their place.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>There maids are straight, and fair of face,<br />
And men are stout for husbandry,<br />
And all is well as it can be<br />
Upon this earth where all has end.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For on them God is pleased to send</span><br />
The gift of Death down from above.<br />
That envy, hatred, and hot love,<br />
Knowledge with hunger by his side,<br />
And avarice and deadly pride,<br />
There may have end like everything<br />
Both to the shepherd and the king:<br />
Lest this green earth become but hell<br />
If folk for ever there should dwell.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full little most men think of this,</span><br />
But half in woe and half in bliss<br />
They pass their lives, and die at last<br />
Unwilling, though their lot be cast<br />
In wretched places of the earth,<br />
Where men have little joy from birth<br />
Until they die; in no such case<br />
Were those who tilled this pleasant place.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There soothly men were loth to die,</span><br />
Though sometimes in his misery<br />
A man would say "Would I were dead!"<br />
Alas! full little likelihead<br />
That he should live for ever there.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So folk within that country fair</span><br />
Lived on, nor from their memories drave<br />
The thought of what they could not have.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>And without need tormented still<br />
Each other with some bitter ill;<br />
Yea, and themselves too, growing grey<br />
With dread of some long-lingering day,<br />
That never came ere they were dead<br />
With green sods growing on the head;<br />
Nowise content with what they had,<br />
But falling still from good to bad<br />
While hard they sought the hopeless best<br />
And seldom happy or at rest<br />
Until at last with lessening blood<br />
One foot within the grave they stood.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now so it chanced that in this land</span><br />
There did a certain castle stand,<br />
Set all alone deep in the hills,<br />
Amid the sound of falling rills<br />
Within a valley of sweet grass,<br />
To which there went one narrow pass<br />
Through the dark hills, but seldom trod.<br />
Rarely did horse-hoof press the sod<br />
About the quiet weedy moat,<br />
Where unscared did the great fish float;<br />
Because men dreaded there to see<br />
The uncouth things of fa&euml;rie;<br />
Nathless by some few fathers old<br />
These tales about the place were told<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That neither squire nor seneschal</span><br />
Or varlet came in bower or hall,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>Yet all things were in order due,<br />
Hangings of gold and red and blue,<br />
And tables with fair service set;<br />
Cups that had paid the C&aelig;sar's debt<br />
Could he have laid his hands on them;<br />
Dorsars, with pearls in every hem,<br />
And fair embroidered gold-wrought things,<br />
Fit for a company of kings;<br />
And in the chambers dainty beds,<br />
With pillows dight for fair young heads;<br />
And horses in the stables were,<br />
And in the cellars wine full clear<br />
And strong, and casks of ale and mead;<br />
Yea, all things a great lord could need.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For whom these things were ready there</span><br />
None knew; but if one chanced to fare<br />
Into that place at Easter-tide,<br />
There would he find a falcon tied<br />
Unto a pillar of the Hall;<br />
And such a fate to him would fall,<br />
That if unto the seventh night,<br />
He watched the bird from dark to light,<br />
And light to dark unceasingly,<br />
On the last evening he should see<br />
A lady beautiful past words;<br />
Then, were he come of clowns or lords,<br />
Son of a swineherd or a king,<br />
There must she grant him anything<br />
Perforce, that he might dare to ask,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>And do his very hardest task<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But if he slumbered, ne'er again</span><br />
The wretch would wake for he was slain<br />
Helpless, by hands he could not see,<br />
And torn and mangled wretchedly.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now said these elders&mdash;Ere this tide</span><br />
Full many folk this thing have tried,<br />
But few have got much good thereby;<br />
For first, a many came to die<br />
By slumbering ere their watch was done;<br />
Or else they saw that lovely one,<br />
And mazed, they knew not what to say;<br />
Or asked some toy for all their pay,<br />
That easily they might have won,<br />
Nor staked their lives and souls thereon;<br />
Or asking, asked for some great thing<br />
That was their bane; as to be king<br />
One asked, and died the morrow morn<br />
That he was crowned, of all forlorn.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet thither came a certain man,</span><br />
Who from being poor great riches wan<br />
Past telling, whose grandsons now are<br />
Great lords thereby in peace and war.<br />
And in their coat-of-arms they bear,<br />
Upon a field of azure fair,<br />
A castle and a falcon, set<br />
Below a chief of golden fret.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in our day a certain knight</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>Prayed to be worsted in no fight,<br />
And so it happed to him: yet he<br />
Died none the less most wretchedly.<br />
And all his prowess was in vain,<br />
For by a losel was he slain,<br />
As on the highway side he slept<br />
One summer night, of no man kept.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such tales as these the fathers old</span><br />
About that lonely castle told;<br />
And in their day the King must try<br />
Himself to prove that mystery,<br />
Although, unless the fay could give<br />
For ever on the earth to live,<br />
Nought could he ask that he had not:<br />
For boundless riches had he got,<br />
Fair children, and a faithful wife;<br />
And happily had passed his life,<br />
And all fulfilled of victory,<br />
Yet was he fain this thing to see.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So towards the mountains he set out</span><br />
One noontide, with a gallant rout<br />
Of knights and lords, and as the day<br />
Began to fail came to the way<br />
Where he must enter all alone,<br />
Between the dreary walls of stone.<br />
Thereon to that fair company<br />
He bade farewell, who wistfully<br />
Looked backward oft as home they rode,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>But in the entry he abode<br />
Of that rough unknown narrowing pass,<br />
Where twilight at the high noon was.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then onward he began to ride:</span><br />
Smooth rose the rocks on every side,<br />
And seemed as they were cut by man;<br />
Adown them ever water ran,<br />
But they of living things were bare,<br />
Yea, not a blade of grass grew there;<br />
And underfoot rough was the way,<br />
For scattered all about there lay<br />
Great jagged pieces of black stone.<br />
Throughout the pass the wind did moan,<br />
With such wild noises, that the King<br />
Could almost think he heard something<br />
Spoken of men; as one might hear<br />
The voices of folk standing near<br />
One's chamber wall: yet saw he nought<br />
Except those high walls strangely wrought,<br />
And overhead the strip of sky.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So, going onward painfully,</span><br />
He met therein no evil thing,<br />
But came about the sun-setting<br />
Unto the opening of the pass,<br />
And thence beheld a vale of grass<br />
Bright with the yellow daffodil;<br />
And all the vale the sun did fill<br />
With his last glory. Midmost there<br />
Rose up a stronghold, built four-square,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>Upon a flowery grassy mound,<br />
That moat and high wall ran around.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thereby he saw a walled pleasance,</span><br />
With walks and sward fit for the dance<br />
Of Arthur's court in its best time,<br />
That seemed to feel some magic clime;<br />
For though through all the vale outside<br />
Things were as in the April-tide,<br />
And daffodils and cowslips grew<br />
And hidden the March violets blew,<br />
Within the bounds of that sweet close<br />
Was trellised the bewildering rose;<br />
There was the lily over-sweet,<br />
And starry pinks for garlands meet;<br />
And apricots hung on the wall<br />
And midst the flowers did peaches fall,<br />
And nought had blemish there or spot.<br />
For in that place decay was not.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Silent awhile the King abode</span><br />
Beholding all, then on he rode<br />
And to the castle-gate drew nigh,<br />
Till fell the drawbridge silently,<br />
And when across it he did ride<br />
He found the great gates open wide,<br />
And entered there, but as he passed<br />
The gates were shut behind him fast,<br />
But not before that he could see<br />
The drawbridge rise up silently.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then round he gazed oppressed with awe,</span><br />
And there no living thing he saw<br />
Except the sparrows in the eaves,<br />
As restless as light autumn leaves<br />
Blown by the fitful rainy wind.<br />
Thereon his final goal to find,<br />
He lighted off his war-horse good<br />
And let him wander as he would,<br />
When he had eased him of his gear;<br />
Then gathering heart against his fear.<br />
Just at the silent end of day<br />
Through the fair porch he took his way<br />
And found at last a goodly hall<br />
With glorious hangings on the wall,<br />
Inwrought with trees of every clime,<br />
And stories of the ancient time,<br />
But all of sorcery they were.<br />
For o'er the da&iuml;s Venus fair,<br />
Fluttered about by many a dove,<br />
Made hopeless men for hopeless love,<br />
Both sick and sorry; there they stood<br />
Wrought wonderfully in various mood,<br />
But wasted all by that hid fire<br />
Of measureless o'er-sweet desire,<br />
And let the hurrying world go by<br />
Forgetting all felicity.<br />
But down the hall the tale was wrought<br />
How Argo in old time was brought<br />
To Colchis for the fleece of gold.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>And on the other side was told<br />
How mariners for long years came<br />
To Circe, winning grief and shame.<br />
Until at last by hardihead<br />
And craft, Ulysses won her bed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long upon these the King did look</span><br />
And of them all good heed he took;<br />
To see if they would tell him aught<br />
About the matter that he sought,<br />
But all were of the times long past;<br />
So going all about, at last<br />
When grown nigh weary of his search<br />
A falcon on a silver perch,<br />
Anigh the da&iuml;s did he see,<br />
And wondered, because certainly<br />
At his first coming 'twas not there;<br />
But 'neath the bird a scroll most fair,<br />
With golden letters on the white<br />
He saw, and in the dim twilight<br />
By diligence could he read this:&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>"Ye who have not enow of bliss,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And in this hard world labour sore,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>By manhood here may get you more,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And be fulfilled of everything,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Till ye be masters of the King.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And yet, since I who promise this</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Am nowise God to give man bliss</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Past ending, now in time beware,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And if you live in little care</i></span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Then turn aback and home again,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Lest unknown woe ye chance to gain</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>In wishing for a thing untried."</i></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A little while did he abide,</span><br />
When he had read this, deep in thought,<br />
Wondering indeed if there were aught<br />
He had not got, that a wise man<br />
Would wish; yet in his mind it ran<br />
That he might win a boundless realm,<br />
Yea, come to wear upon his helm<br />
The crown of the whole conquered earth;<br />
That all who lived thereon, from birth<br />
To death should call him King and Lord,<br />
And great kings tremble at his word,<br />
Until in turn he came to die.<br />
Therewith a little did he sigh,<br />
But thought, "Of Alexander yet<br />
Men talk, nor would they e'er forget<br />
My name, if this should come to be,<br />
Whoever should come after me:<br />
But while I lay wrapped round with gold<br />
Should tales and histories manifold<br />
Be written of me, false and true;<br />
And as the time still onward drew<br />
Almost a god would folk count me,<br />
Saying, 'In our time none such be.'"<br />
But therewith did he sigh again,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>And said, "Ah, vain, and worse than vain!<br />
For though the world forget me nought,<br />
Yet by that time should I be brought<br />
Where all the world I should forget,<br />
And bitterly should I regret<br />
That I, from godlike great renown,<br />
To helpless death must fall adown:<br />
How could I bear to leave it all?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then straight upon his mind did fall</span><br />
Thoughts of old longings half forgot,<br />
Matters for which his heart was hot<br />
A while ago: whereof no more<br />
He cared for some, and some right sore<br />
Had vexed him, being fulfilled at last.<br />
And when the thought of these had passed<br />
Still something was there left behind,<br />
That by no torturing of his mind<br />
Could he in any language name,<br />
Or into form of wishing frame.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last he thought, "What matters it,</span><br />
Before these seven days shall flit<br />
Some great thing surely shall I find,<br />
That gained will not leave grief behind,<br />
Nor turn to deadly injury.<br />
So now will I let these things be<br />
And think of some unknown delight."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now, therewithal, was come the night</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>And thus his watch was well begun;<br />
And till the rising of the sun,<br />
Waking, he paced about the hall,<br />
And saw the hangings on the wall<br />
Fade into nought, and then grow white<br />
In patches by the pale moonlight,<br />
And then again fade utterly<br />
As still the moonbeams passed them by;<br />
Then in a while, with hope of day,<br />
Begin a little to grow grey,<br />
Until familiar things they grew,<br />
As up at last the great sun drew,<br />
And lit them with his yellow light<br />
At ending of another night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then right glad was he of the day,</span><br />
That passed with him in such-like way;<br />
For neither man nor beast came near,<br />
Nor any voices did he hear.<br />
And when again it drew to night<br />
Silent it passed, till first twilight<br />
Of morning came, and then he heard<br />
The feeble twittering of some bird,<br />
That, in that utter silence drear,<br />
Smote harsh and startling on his ear.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therewith came on that lonely day</span><br />
That passed him in no other way;<br />
And thus six days and nights went by<br />
And nothing strange had come anigh.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on that day he well-nigh deemed</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>That all that story had been dreamed.<br />
Daylight and dark, and night and day,<br />
Passed ever in their wonted way;<br />
The wind played in the trees outside,<br />
The rooks from out the high trees cried;<br />
And all seemed natural, frank, and fair,<br />
With little signs of magic there.<br />
Yet neither could he quite forget<br />
That close with summer blossoms set,<br />
And fruit hung on trees blossoming,<br />
When all about was early spring.<br />
Yea, if all this by man were made,<br />
Strange was it that yet undecayed<br />
The food lay on the tables still<br />
Unchanged by man, that wine did fill<br />
The golden cups, yet bright and red.<br />
And all was so apparell&eacute;d<br />
For guests that came not, yet was all<br />
As though that servants filled the hall.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So waxed and waned his hopes, and still</span><br />
He formed no wish for good or ill.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And while he thought of this and that</span><br />
Upon his perch the falcon sat<br />
Unfed, unhooded, his bright eyes<br />
Beholders of the hard-earned prize,<br />
Glancing around him restlessly,<br />
As though he knew the time drew nigh<br />
When this long watching should be done.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">So little by little fell the sun,</span><br />
From high noon unto sun-setting;<br />
And in that lapse of time the King,<br />
Though still he woke, yet none the less<br />
Was dreaming in his sleeplessness<br />
Of this and that which he had done<br />
Before this watch he had begun;<br />
Till, with a start, he looked at last<br />
About him, and all dreams were past;<br />
For now, though it was past twilight<br />
Without, within all grew as bright<br />
As when the noon-sun smote the wall,<br />
Though no lamp shone within the hall.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then rose the King upon his feet,</span><br />
And well-nigh heard his own heart beat,<br />
And grew all pale for hope and fear,<br />
As sound of footsteps caught his ear<br />
But soft, and as some fair lady,<br />
Going as gently as might be,<br />
Stopped now and then awhile, distraught<br />
By pleasant wanderings of sweet thought.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nigher the sound came, and more nigh,</span><br />
Until the King unwittingly<br />
Trembled, and felt his hair arise,<br />
But on the door still kept his eyes.<br />
That opened soon, and in the light<br />
There stepped alone a lady bright,<br />
And made straight toward him up the hall.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In golden garments was she clad</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>And round her waist a belt she had<br />
Of emeralds fair, and from her feet,<br />
That shod with gold the floor did meet,<br />
She held the raiment daintily,<br />
And on her golden head had she<br />
A rose-wreath round a pearl-wrought crown,<br />
Softly she walked with eyes cast down,<br />
Nor looked she any other than<br />
An earthly lady, though no man<br />
Has seen so fair a thing as she.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So when her face the King could see</span><br />
Still more he trembled, and he thought,<br />
"Surely my wish is hither brought,<br />
And this will be a goodly day<br />
If for mine own I win this may."<br />
And therewithal she drew anear<br />
Until the trembling King could hear<br />
Her very breathing, and she raised<br />
Her head and on the King's face gazed<br />
With serious eyes, and stopping there,<br />
Swept from her shoulders her long hair,<br />
And let her gown fall on her feet,<br />
Then spoke in a clear voice and sweet:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Well hast thou watched, so now, O King,</span><br />
Be bold, and wish for some good thing;<br />
And yet, I counsel thee, be wise.<br />
Behold, spite of these lips and eyes,<br />
Hundreds of years old now am I<br />
And have seen joy and misery.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>And thou, who yet hast lived in bliss.<br />
I bid thee well consider this;<br />
Better it were that men should live<br />
As beasts, and take what earth can give,<br />
The air, the warm sun and the grass<br />
Until unto the earth they pass,<br />
And gain perchance nought worse than rest<br />
Than that not knowing what is best<br />
For sons of men, they needs must thirst<br />
For what shall make their lives accurst.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Therefore I bid thee now beware,</span><br />
Lest getting something seeming fair,<br />
Thou com'st in vain to long for more<br />
Or lest the thing thou wishest for<br />
Make thee unhappy till thou diest,<br />
Or lest with speedy death thou buyest<br />
A little hour of happiness<br />
Or lazy joy with sharp distress.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Alas, why say I this to thee,</span><br />
For now I see full certainly,<br />
That thou wilt ask for such a thing,<br />
It had been best for thee to fling<br />
Thy body from a mountain-top,<br />
Or in a white hot fire to drop,<br />
Or ever thou hadst seen me here,<br />
Nay then be speedy and speak clear."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then the King cried out eagerly,</span><br />
Grown fearless, "Ah, be kind to me!<br />
Thou knowest what I long for then!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>Thou know'st that I, a king of men,<br />
Will ask for nothing else than thee!<br />
Thou didst not say this could not be,<br />
And I have had enough of bliss,<br />
If I may end my life with this."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Hearken," she said, "what men will say</span><br />
When they are mad; before to-day<br />
I knew that words such things could mean,<br />
And wondered that it could have been.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Think well, because this wished-for joy,</span><br />
That surely will thy bliss destroy,<br />
Will let thee live, until thy life<br />
Is wrapped in such bewildering strife<br />
That all thy days will seem but ill&mdash;<br />
Now wilt thou wish for this thing still?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Wilt thou then grant it?" cried the King;</span><br />
"Surely thou art an earthly thing,<br />
And all this is but mockery,<br />
And thou canst tell no more than I<br />
What ending to my life shall be."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Nay, then," she said, "I grant it thee</span><br />
Perforce; come nigh, for I am thine<br />
Until the morning sun doth shine,<br />
And only coming time can prove<br />
What thing I am."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Dizzy with love,</span><br />
And with surprise struck motionless<br />
That this divine thing, with far less<br />
Of striving than a village maid,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>Had yielded, there he stood afraid,<br />
Spite of hot words and passionate,<br />
And strove to think upon his fate.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as he stood there, presently</span><br />
With smiling face she drew anigh,<br />
And on his face he felt her breath.<br />
"O love," she said, "dost thou fear death?<br />
Not till next morning shalt thou die,<br />
Or fall into thy misery."<br />
Then on his hand her hand did fall,<br />
And forth she led him down the hall,<br />
Going full softly by his side.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O love," she said, "now well betide</span><br />
The day whereon thou cam'st to me.<br />
I would this night a year might be,<br />
Yea, life-long; such life as we have,<br />
A thousand years from womb to grave."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then that clinging hand seemed worth</span><br />
Whatever joy was left on earth,<br />
And every trouble he forgot,<br />
And time and death remembered not:<br />
Kinder she grew, she clung to him<br />
With loving arms, her eyes did swim<br />
With love and pity, as he strove<br />
To show the wisdom of his love;<br />
With trembling lips she praised his choice,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>And said, "Ah, well may'st thou rejoice,<br />
Well may'st thou think this one short night<br />
Worth years of other men's delight.<br />
If thy heart as mine own heart is,<br />
Sunk in a boundless sea of bliss;<br />
O love, rejoice with me! rejoice!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as she spoke, her honied voice</span><br />
Trembled, and midst of sobs she said,<br />
"O love, and art thou still afraid?<br />
Return, then, to thine happiness,<br />
Nor will I love thee any less;<br />
But watch thee as a mother might<br />
Her child at play."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">With strange delight</span><br />
He stammered out, "Nay, keep thy tears<br />
for me, and for my ruined years<br />
Weep love, that I may love thee more,<br />
My little hour will soon be o'er."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ah, love," she said, "and thou art wise</span><br />
As men are, with long miseries<br />
Buying these idle words and vain,<br />
My foolish love, with lasting pain;<br />
And yet, thou wouldst have died at last<br />
If in all wisdom thou hadst passed<br />
Thy weary life: forgive me then,<br />
In pitying the sad life of men."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then in such bliss his soul did swim,</span><br />
But tender music unto him<br />
Her words were; death and misery<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>But empty names were grown to be,<br />
As from that place his steps she drew,<br />
And dark the hall behind them grew.</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">B</span><span class="caps">ut</span> end comes to all earthly bliss,</span><br />
And by his choice full short was his;<br />
And in the morning, grey and cold,<br />
Beside the da&iuml;s did she hold<br />
His trembling hand, and wistfully<br />
He, doubting what his fate should be,<br />
Gazed at her solemn eyes, that now,<br />
Beneath her calm, untroubled brow,<br />
Were fixed on his wild face and wan;<br />
At last she said, "Oh, hapless man,<br />
Depart! thy full wish hast thou had;<br />
A little time thou hast been glad,<br />
Thou shalt be sorry till thou die.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And though, indeed, full fain am I</span><br />
This might not be; nathless, as day<br />
Night follows, colourless and grey,<br />
So this shall follow thy delight,<br />
Your joy hath ending with last night&mdash;<br />
Nay, peace, and hearken to thy fate.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Strife without peace, early and late,</span><br />
Lasting long after thou art dead,<br />
And laid with earth upon thine head;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>War without victory shalt thou have,<br />
Defeat, nor honour shalt thou save;<br />
Thy fair land shall be rent and torn,<br />
Thy people be of all forlorn,<br />
And all men curse thee for this thing."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She loosed his hand, but yet the King</span><br />
Said, "Yea, and I may go with thee?<br />
Why should we part? then let things be<br />
E'en as they will!" "Poor man," she said,<br />
"Thou ravest; our hot love is dead,<br />
If ever it had any life:<br />
Go, make thee ready for the strife<br />
Wherein thy days shall soon be wrapped;<br />
And of the things that here have happed<br />
Make thou such joy as thou may'st do;<br />
But I from this place needs must go,<br />
Nor shalt thou ever see me more<br />
Until thy troubled life is o'er:<br />
Alas I to say 'farewell' to thee<br />
Were nought but bitter mockery.<br />
Fare as thou may'st, and with good heart<br />
Play to the end thy wretched part."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therewith she turned and went from him,</span><br />
And with such pain his eyes did swim<br />
He scarce could see her leave the place;<br />
And then, with troubled and pale face,<br />
He gat him thence: and soon he found<br />
His good horse in the base-court bound;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>So, loosing him, forth did he ride,<br />
For the great gates were open wide,<br />
And flat the heavy drawbridge lay.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So by the middle of the day,</span><br />
That murky pass had he gone through,<br />
And come to country that he knew;<br />
And homeward turned his horse's head.<br />
And passing village and homestead<br />
Nigh to his palace came at last;<br />
And still the further that he passed<br />
From that strange castle of the fays,<br />
More dreamlike seemed those seven days,<br />
And dreamlike the delicious night;<br />
And like a dream the shoulders white,<br />
And clinging arms and yellow hair,<br />
And dreamlike the sad morning there.<br />
Until at last he 'gan to deem<br />
That all might well have been a dream&mdash;<br />
Yet why was life a weariness?<br />
What meant this sting of sharp distress?<br />
This longing for a hopeless love,<br />
No sighing from his heart could move?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or else, 'She did not come and go</span><br />
As fays might do, but soft and slow<br />
Her lovely feet fell on the floor;<br />
She set her fair hand to the door<br />
As any dainty maid might do;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>And though, indeed, there are but few<br />
Beneath the sun as fair as she,<br />
She seemed a fleshly thing to be.<br />
Perchance a merry mock this is,<br />
And I may some day have the bliss<br />
To see her lovely face again,<br />
As smiling she makes all things plain.<br />
And then as I am still a king,<br />
With me may she make tarrying<br />
Full long, yea, till I come to die."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therewith at last being come anigh</span><br />
Unto his very palace gate,<br />
He saw his knights and squires wait<br />
His coming, therefore on the ground<br />
He lighted, and they flocked around<br />
Till he should tell them of his fare.<br />
Then mocking said he, "Ye may dare,<br />
The worst man of you all, to go<br />
And watch as I was bold to do;<br />
For nought I heard except the wind,<br />
And nought I saw to call to mind."<br />
So said he, but they noted well<br />
That something more he had to tell<br />
If it had pleased him; one old man,<br />
Beholding his changed face and wan,<br />
Muttered, "Would God it might be so!<br />
Alas! I fear what fate may do;<br />
Too much good fortune hast thou had<br />
By anything to be more glad<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>Than thou hast been, I fear thee then<br />
Lest thou becom'st a curse to men."<br />
But to his place the doomed King passed,<br />
And all remembrance strove to cast<br />
From out his mind of that past day,<br />
And spent his life in sport and play.</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">G</span><span class="caps">reat</span> among other kings, I said</span><br />
He was before he first was led<br />
Unto that castle of the fays,<br />
But soon he lost his happy days<br />
And all his goodly life was done.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And first indeed his best-loved son,</span><br />
The very apple of his eye,<br />
Waged war against him bitterly;<br />
And when this son was overcome<br />
And taken, and folk led him home,<br />
And him the King had gone to meet,<br />
Meaning with gentle words and sweet<br />
To win him to his love again,<br />
By his own hand he found him slain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I know not if the doomed King yet</span><br />
Remembered the fay lady's threat,<br />
But troubles upon troubles came:<br />
His daughter next was brought to shame,<br />
Who unto all eyes seemed to be<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>The image of all purity,<br />
And fleeing from the royal place<br />
The King no more beheld her face.<br />
Then next a folk that came from far<br />
Sent to the King great threats of war,<br />
But he, full-fed of victory,<br />
Deemed this a little thing to be,<br />
And thought the troubles of his home<br />
Thereby he well might overcome<br />
Amid the hurry of the fight.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His foemen seemed of little might,</span><br />
Although they thronged like summer bees<br />
About the outlying villages,<br />
And on the land great ruin brought.<br />
Well, he this barbarous people sought<br />
With such an army as seemed meet<br />
To put the world beneath his feet;<br />
The day of battle came, and he,<br />
Flushed with the hope of victory,<br />
Grew happy, as he had not been<br />
Since he those glorious eyes had seen.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They met,&mdash;his solid ranks of steel</span><br />
There scarcely more the darts could feel<br />
Of those new foemen, than if they<br />
Had been a hundred miles away:&mdash;<br />
They met,&mdash;a storied folk were his<br />
To whom sharp war had long been bliss,<br />
A thousand years of memories<br />
Were flashing in their shielded eyes;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>And grave philosophers they had<br />
To bid them ever to be glad<br />
To meet their death and get life done<br />
Midst glorious deeds from sire to son.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And those they met were beasts, or worse,</span><br />
To whom life seemed a jest, a curse;<br />
Of fame and name they had not heard;<br />
Honour to them was but a word,<br />
A word spoke in another tongue;<br />
No memories round their banners clung,<br />
No walls they knew, no art of war,<br />
By hunger were they driven afar<br />
Unto the place whereon they stood,<br />
Ravening for bestial joys and blood.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No wonder if these barbarous men</span><br />
Were slain by hundreds to each ten<br />
Of the King's brave well-armoured folk,<br />
No wonder if their charges broke<br />
To nothing, on the walls of steel,<br />
And back the baffled hordes must reel.<br />
So stood throughout a summer day<br />
Scarce touched the King's most fair array,<br />
Yet as it drew to even-tide<br />
The foe still surged on every side,<br />
As hopeless hunger-bitten men,<br />
About his folk grown wearied then.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therewith the King beheld that crowd</span><br />
Howling and dusk, and cried aloud,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>"What do ye, warriors? and how long<br />
Shall weak folk hold in check the strong?<br />
Nay, forward banners! end the day<br />
And show these folk how brave men play."<br />
The young knights shouted at his word,<br />
But the old folk in terror heard<br />
The shouting run adown the line,<br />
And saw men flush as if with wine&mdash;<br />
"O Sire," they said, "the day is sure,<br />
Nor will these folk the night endure<br />
Beset with misery and fears."<br />
Alas I they spoke to heedless ears;<br />
For scarce one look on them he cast<br />
But forward through the ranks he passed,<br />
And cried out, "Who will follow me<br />
To win a fruitful victory?"<br />
And toward the foe in haste he spurred,<br />
And at his back their shouts he heard,<br />
Such shouts as he ne'er heard again.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They met&mdash;ere moonrise all the plain</span><br />
Was filled by men in hurrying flight<br />
The relics of that shameful fight;<br />
The close array, the full-armed men,<br />
The ancient fame availed not then,<br />
The dark night only was a friend<br />
To bring that slaughter to an end;<br />
And surely there the King had died.<br />
But driven by that back-rushing tide<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>Against his will he needs must flee;<br />
And as he pondered bitterly<br />
On all that wreck that he had wrought,<br />
From time to time indeed he thought<br />
Of the fay woman's dreadful threat.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But everything was not lost yet;</span><br />
Next day he said, great was the rout<br />
And shameful beyond any doubt,<br />
But since indeed at eventide<br />
The flight began, not many died,<br />
And gathering all the stragglers now<br />
His troops still made a gallant show&mdash;<br />
Alas! it was a show indeed;<br />
Himself desponding, did he lead<br />
His beaten men against the foe,<br />
Thinking at least to lie alow<br />
Before the final rout should be<br />
But scarce upon the enemy<br />
Could these, whose shaken banners shook<br />
The frightened world, now dare to look;<br />
Nor yet could the doomed King die there<br />
A death he once had held most fair;<br />
Amid unwounded men he came<br />
Back to his city, bent with shame,<br />
Unkingly, midst his great distress,<br />
Yea, weeping at the bitterness<br />
Of women's curses that did greet<br />
His passage down the troubled street<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But sight of all the things they loved,</span><br />
The memory of their manhood moved<br />
Within the folk, and aged men<br />
And boys must think of battle then.<br />
And men that had not seen the foe<br />
Must clamour to the war to go.<br />
So a great army poured once more<br />
From out the city, and before<br />
The very gates they fought again,<br />
But their late valour was in vain;<br />
They died indeed, and that was good,<br />
But nought they gained for all the blood<br />
Poured out like water; for the foe,<br />
Men might have stayed a while ago,<br />
A match for very gods were grown,<br />
So like the field in June-tide mown<br />
The King's men fell, and but in vain<br />
The remnant strove the town to gain;<br />
Whose battlements were nought to stay<br />
An untaught foe upon that day,<br />
Though many a tale the annals told<br />
Of sieges in the days of old,<br />
When all the world then knew of war<br />
From that fair place was driven afar.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As for the King, a charmed life</span><br />
He seemed to bear; from out that strife<br />
He came unhurt, and he could see,<br />
As down the valley he did flee<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>With his most wretched company,<br />
His palace flaming to the sky.<br />
Then in the very midst of woe<br />
His yearning thoughts would backward go<br />
Unto the castle of the fay;<br />
He muttered, "Shall I curse that day,<br />
The last delight that I have had,<br />
For certainly I then was glad?<br />
And who knows if what men call bliss<br />
Had been much better now than this<br />
When I am hastening to the end."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That fearful rest, that dreaded friend,</span><br />
That Death, he did not gain as yet;<br />
A band of men he soon did get,<br />
A ruined rout of bad and good,<br />
With whom within the tangled wood,<br />
The rugged mountain, he abode,<br />
And thenceforth oftentimes they rode<br />
Into the fair land once called his,<br />
And yet but little came of this,<br />
Except more woe for Heaven to see<br />
Some little added misery<br />
Unto that miserable realm:<br />
The barbarous foe did overwhelm<br />
The cities and the fertile plain,<br />
And many a peaceful man was slain,<br />
And many a maiden brought to shame.<br />
And yielded towns were set aflame;<br />
For all the land was masterless.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long dwelt the King in great distress,</span><br />
From wood to mountain ever tost,<br />
Mourning for all that he had lost,<br />
Until it chanced upon a day,<br />
Asleep in early morn he lay,<br />
And in a vision there did see<br />
Clad all in black, that fay lady<br />
Whereby all this had come to pass,<br />
But dim as in a misty glass:<br />
She said, "I come thy death to tell<br />
Yet now to thee may say 'farewell,'<br />
For in a short space wilt thou be<br />
Within an endless dim country<br />
Where thou may'st well win woe or bliss,"<br />
Therewith she stooped his lips to kiss<br />
And vanished straightway from his sight.<br />
So waking there he sat upright<br />
And looked around, but nought could see<br />
And heard but song-birds' melody,<br />
For that was the first break of day.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then with a sigh adown he lay</span><br />
And slept, nor ever woke again,<br />
For in that hour was he slain<br />
By stealthy traitors as he slept.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He of a few was much bewept,</span><br />
But of most men was well forgot<br />
While the town's ashes still were hot<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>The foeman on that day did burn.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As for the land, great Time did turn</span><br />
The bloody fields to deep green grass,<br />
And from the minds of men did pass<br />
The memory of that time of woe,<br />
And at this day all things are so<br />
As first I said; a land it is<br />
Where men may dwell in rest and bliss<br />
If so they will&mdash;Who yet will not,<br />
Because their hasty hearts are hot<br />
With foolish hate, and longing vain<br />
The sire and dam of grief and pain.</p></div>

Although those old men shared the happiness<br />

Amidst the Roman's handiwork, behold<br />
Far off the long-roofed church; the shepherd binds<br />

Down in the foss the river fed of old,<br />
That through long lapse of time has grown to be<br />
The little grassy valley that you see.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rest here awhile, not yet the eve is still,</span><br />
The bees are wandering yet, and you may hear<br />
The barley mowers on the trench&eacute;d hill,<br />
The sheep-bells, and the restless changing weir,<br />
All little sounds made musical and clear<br />
Beneath the sky that burning August gives.<br />
While yet the thought of glorious Summer lives.<br />

<h2>PYGMALION AND THE IMAGE.</h2>

<h3>ARGUMENT.</h3>

<p class="hang">A man of Cyprus, a sculptor named Pygmalion, made an image of a woman,
fairer than any that had yet been seen, and in the end came to love
his own handiwork as though it had been alive: wherefore, praying to
Venus for help, he obtained his end, for she made the image alive
indeed, and a woman, and Pygmalion wedded her.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">A</span><span class="caps">t</span> Amathus, that from the southern side</span><br />
Of Cyprus, looks across the Syrian sea,<br />
There did in ancient time a man abide<br />
Known to the island-dwellers, for that he<br />
Had wrought most godlike works in imagery,<br />
And day by day still greater honour won,<br />
Which man our old books call Pygmalion.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet in the praise of men small joy he had,</span><br />
But walked abroad with downcast brooding face.<br />
Nor yet by any damsel was made glad;<br />
For, sooth to say, the women of that place<br />
Must seem to all men an accursed race,<br />
Who with the Turner of all Hearts once strove<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>And now their hearts must carry lust for love.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon a day it chanced that he had been</span><br />
About the streets, and on the crowded quays,<br />
Rich with unopened wealth of bales, had seen<br />
The dark-eyed merchants of the southern seas<br />
In chaffer with the base Prop&oelig;tides,<br />
And heavy-hearted gat him home again,<br />
His once-loved life grown idle, poor, and vain.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there upon his images he cast</span><br />
His weary eyes, yet little noted them,<br />
As still from name to name his swift thought passed.<br />
For what to him was Juno's well-wrought hem,<br />
Diana's shaft, or Pallas' olive-stem?<br />
What help could Hermes' rod unto him give,<br />
Until with shadowy things he came to live?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet note, that though, while looking on the sun,</span><br />
The craftsman o'er his work some morn of spring<br />
May chide his useless labour never done,<br />
For all his murmurs, with no other thing<br />
He soothes his heart, and dulls thought's poisonous sting,<br />
And thus in thought's despite the world goes on;<br />
And so it was with this Pygmalion.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unto the chisel must he set his hand,</span><br />
And slowly, still in troubled thought must pace,<br />
About a work begun, that there doth stand,<br />
And still returning to the self-same place,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>Unto the image now must set his face,<br />
And with a sigh his wonted toil begin,<br />
Half-loathed, half-loved, a little rest to win.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lessening marble that he worked upon,</span><br />
A woman's form now imaged doubtfully,<br />
And in such guise the work had he begun,<br />
Because when he the untouched block did see<br />
In wandering veins that form there seemed to be,<br />
Whereon he cried out in a careless mood,<br />
"O lady Venus, make this presage good!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And then this block of stone shall be thy maid,</span><br />
And, not without rich golden ornament,<br />
Shall bide within thy quivering myrtle-shade."<br />
So spoke he, but the goddess, well content,<br />
Unto his hand such godlike mastery sent,<br />
That like the first artificer he wrought,<br />
Who made the gift that woe to all men brought.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet, but such as he was wont to do,</span><br />
At first indeed that work divine he deemed,<br />
And as the white chips from the chisel flew<br />
Of other matters languidly he dreamed,<br />
For easy to his hand that labour seemed,<br />
And he was stirred with many a troubling thought,<br />
And many a doubt perplexed him as he wrought.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet, again, at last there came a day</span><br />
When smoother and more shapely grew the stone<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>And he, grown eager, put all thought away<br />
But that which touched his craftsmanship alone,<br />
And he would gaze at what his hands had done,<br />
Until his heart with boundless joy would swell<br />
That all was wrought so wonderfully well.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet long it was ere he was satisfied,</span><br />
And with the pride that by his mastery<br />
This thing was done, whose equal far and wide<br />
In no town of the world a man could see,<br />
Came burning longing that the work should be<br />
E'en better still, and to his heart there came<br />
A strange and strong desire he could not name.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The night seemed long, and long the twilight seemed,</span><br />
A vain thing seemed his flowery garden fair;<br />
Though through the night still of his work he dreamed,<br />
And though his smooth-stemmed trees so nigh it were,<br />
That thence he could behold the marble hair;<br />
Nought was enough, until with steel in hand<br />
He came before the wondrous stone to stand.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No song could charm him, and no histories</span><br />
Of men's misdoings could avail him now,<br />
Nay, scarcely seaward had he turned his eyes,<br />
If men had said, "The fierce Tyrrhenians row<br />
Up through the bay, rise up and strike a blow<br />
For life and goods;" for nought to him seemed dear<br />
But to his well-loved work to be anear.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then vexed he grew, and knowing not his heart,</span><br />
Unto himself he said, "Ah, what is this,<br />
That I who oft was happy to depart,<br />
And wander where the boughs each other kiss<br />
'Neath the west wind, now have no other bliss<br />
But in vain smoothing of this marble maid,<br />
Whose chips this month a drachma had outweighed?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Lo I will get me to the woods and try</span><br />
If I my woodcraft have forgotten quite,<br />
And then, returning, lay this folly by,<br />
And eat my fill, and sleep my sleep anight,<br />
And 'gin to carve a Hercules aright<br />
Upon the morrow, and perchance indeed<br />
The Theban will be good to me at need."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With that he took his quiver and his bow,</span><br />
And through the gates of Amathus he went,<br />
And toward the mountain slopes began to go,<br />
Within the woods to work out his intent.<br />
Fair was the day, the honied beanfield's scent<br />
The west wind bore unto him, o'er the way<br />
The glittering noisy poplar leaves did play.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All things were moving; as his hurried feet</span><br />
Passed by, within the flowery swathe he heard<br />
The sweeping of the scythe, the swallow fleet<br />
Rose over him, the sitting partridge stirred<br />
On the field's edge; the brown bee by him whirred,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>Or murmured in the clover flowers below.<br />
But he with bowed-down head failed not to go.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last he stopped, and, looking round, he said,</span><br />
"Like one whose thirtieth year is well gone by,<br />
The day is getting ready to be dead;<br />
No rest, and on the border of the sky<br />
Already the great banks of dark haze lie;<br />
No rest&mdash;what do I midst this stir and noise?<br />
What part have I in these unthinking joys?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With that he turned, and toward the city-gate</span><br />
Through the sweet fields went swifter than he came,<br />
And cast his heart into the hands of fate;<br />
Nor strove with it, when higher 'gan to flame<br />
That strange and strong desire without a name;<br />
Till panting, thinking of nought else, once more<br />
His hand was on the latch of his own door.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One moment there he lingered, as he said,</span><br />
"Alas! what should I do if she were gone?"<br />
But even with that word his brow waxed red<br />
To hear his own lips name a thing of stone,<br />
As though the gods some marvel there had done,<br />
And made his work alive; and therewithal<br />
In turn great pallor on his face did fall.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But with a sigh he passed into the house,</span><br />
Yet even then his chamber-door must hold,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>And listen there, half blind and timorous,<br />
Until his heart should wax a little bold;<br />
Then entering, motionless and white and cold,<br />
He saw the image stand amidst the floor<br />
All whitened now by labour done before.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blinded with tears, his chisel up he caught,</span><br />
And, drawing near, and sighing, tenderly<br />
Upon the marvel of the face he wrought,<br />
E'en as he used to pass the long days by;<br />
But his sighs changed to sobbing presently,<br />
And on the floor the useless steel he flung,<br />
And, weeping loud, about the image clung.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Alas!" he cried, "why have I made thee then,</span><br />
That thus thou mockest me? I know indeed<br />
That many such as thou are loved of men,<br />
Whose passionate eyes poor wretches still will lead<br />
Into their net, and smile to see them bleed;<br />
But these the god's made, and this hand made thee<br />
Who wilt not speak one little word to me."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then from the image did he draw aback</span><br />
To gaze on it through tears: and you had said,<br />
Regarding it, that little did it lack<br />
To be a living and most lovely maid;<br />
Naked it was, its unbound locks were laid<br />
Over the lovely shoulders; with one hand<br />
Reached out, as to a lover, did it stand,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The other held a fair rose over-blown;</span><br />
No smile was on the parted lips, the eyes<br />
Seemed as if even now great love had shown<br />
Unto them, something of its sweet surprise,<br />
Yet saddened them with half-seen mysteries,<br />
And still midst passion maiden-like she seemed,<br />
As though of love unchanged for aye she dreamed.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reproachfully beholding all her grace,</span><br />
Pygmalion stood, until he grew dry-eyed,<br />
And then at last he turned away his face<br />
As if from her cold eyes his grief to hide;<br />
And thus a weary while did he abide,<br />
With nothing in his heart but vain desire,<br />
The ever-burning, unconsuming fire.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when again he turned his visage round</span><br />
His eyes were brighter and no more he wept,<br />
As if some little solace he had found,<br />
Although his folly none the more had slept,<br />
Rather some new-born god-sent madness kept<br />
His other madness from destroying him,<br />
And made the hope of death wax faint and dim;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For, trembling and ashamed, from out the street</span><br />
Strong men he called, and faint with jealousy<br />
He caused them bear the ponderous, moveless feet<br />
Unto the chamber where he used to lie,<br />
So in a fair niche to his bed anigh,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>Unwitting of his woe, they set it down,<br />
Then went their ways beneath his troubled frown.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then to his treasury he went, and sought</span><br />
Fair gems for its adornment, but all there<br />
Seemed to his eager eyes but poor and nought,<br />
Not worthy e'en to touch her rippled hair.<br />
So he, departing, through the streets 'gan fare,<br />
And from the merchants at a mighty cost<br />
Bought gems that kings for no good deed had lost.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These then he hung her senseless neck around,</span><br />
Set on her fingers, and fair arms of stone,<br />
Then cast himself before her on the ground,<br />
Praying for grace for all that he had done<br />
In leaving her untended and alone;<br />
And still with every hour his madness grew<br />
Though all his folly in his heart he knew.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last asleep before her feet he lay,</span><br />
Worn out with passion, yet this burning pain<br />
Returned on him, when with the light of day<br />
He woke and wept before her feet again;<br />
Then of the fresh and new-born morning fain,<br />
Into his garden passed, and therefrom bore<br />
New spoil of flowers his love to lay before.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A little altar, with fine gold o'erlaid,</span><br />
Was in his house, that he a while ago<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>At some great man's command had deftly made,<br />
And this he now must take and set below<br />
Her well-wrought feet, and there must red flame glow<br />
About sweet wood, and he must send her thence<br />
The odour of Arabian frankincense.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then as the smoke went up, he prayed and said,</span><br />
"Thou, image, hear'st me not, nor wilt thou speak,<br />
But I perchance shall know when I am dead,<br />
If this has been some goddess' sport, to seek<br />
A wretch, and in his heart infirm and weak<br />
To set her glorious image, so that he,<br />
Loving the form of immortality,<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"May make much laughter for the gods above:</span><br />
Hear me, and if my love misliketh thee<br />
Then take my life away, for I will love<br />
Till death unfeared at last shall come to me,<br />
And give me rest, if he of might may be<br />
To slay the love of that which cannot die,<br />
The heavenly beauty that can ne'er pass by."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No word indeed the moveless image said,</span><br />
But with the sweet grave eyes his hands had wrought<br />
Still gazed down on his bowed imploring head,<br />
Yet his own words some solace to him brought,<br />
Gilding the net wherein his soul was caught<br />
With something like to hope, and all that day<br />
Some tender words he ever found to say;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And still he felt as something heard him speak;</span><br />
Sometimes he praised her beauty, and sometimes<br />
Reproached her in a feeble voice and weak,<br />
And at the last drew forth a book of rhymes,<br />
Wherein were writ the tales of many climes,<br />
And read aloud the sweetness hid therein<br />
Of lovers' sorrows and their tangled sin.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when the sun went down, the frankincense</span><br />
Again upon the altar-flame he cast<br />
That through the open window floating thence<br />
O'er the fresh odours of the garden passed;<br />
And so another day was gone at last,<br />
And he no more his love-lorn watch could keep,<br />
But now for utter weariness must sleep.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But in the night he dreamed that she was gone,</span><br />
And knowing that he dreamed, tried hard to wake<br />
And could not, but forsaken and alone<br />
He seemed to weep as though his heart would break,<br />
And when the night her sleepy veil did take<br />
From off the world, waking, his tears he found<br />
Still wet upon the pillow all around.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then at the first, bewildered by those tears,</span><br />
He fell a-wondering wherefore he had wept,<br />
But suddenly remembering all his fears,<br />
Panting with terror, from the bed he leapt,<br />
But still its wonted place the image kept,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>Nor moved for all the joyful ecstasy<br />
Wherewith he blessed the day that showed it nigh.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then came the morning offering and the day,</span><br />
Midst flowers and words of love and kisses sweet<br />
From morn, through noon, to evening passed away,<br />
And scarce unhappy, crouching at her feet<br />
He saw the sun descend the sea to meet;<br />
And scarce unhappy through the darkness crept<br />
Unto his bed, and midst soft dreaming slept.</p></div>


<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">B</span><span class="caps">ut</span> the next morn, e'en while the incense-smoke</span><br />
At sun-rising curled round about her head,<br />
Sweet sound of songs the wonted quiet broke<br />
Down in the street, and he by something led,<br />
He knew not what, must leave his prayer unsaid,<br />
And through the freshness of the morn must see<br />
The folk who went with that sweet minstrelsy;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Damsels and youths in wonderful attire,</span><br />
And in their midst upon a car of gold<br />
An image of the Mother of Desire,<br />
Wrought by his hands in days that seemed grown old<br />
Though those sweet limbs a garment did enfold,<br />
Coloured like flame, enwrought with precious things,<br />
Most fit to be the prize of striving kings.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then he remembered that the manner was</span><br />
That fair-clad priests the lovely Queen should take<br />
Thrice in the year, and through the city pass,<br />
And with sweet songs the dreaming folk awake;<br />
And through the clouds a light there seemed to break<br />
When he remembered all the tales well told<br />
About her glorious kindly deeds of old.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So his unfinished prayer he finished not,</span><br />
But, kneeling, once more kissed the marble feet,<br />
And, while his heart with many thoughts waxed hot,<br />
He clad himself with fresh attire and meet<br />
For that bright service, and with blossoms sweet<br />
Entwined with tender leaves he crowned his head,<br />
And followed after as the goddess led.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But long and vain unto him seemed the way</span><br />
Until they came unto her house again;<br />
Long years, the while they went about to lay<br />
The honey-hiding dwellers on the plain,<br />
The sweet companions of the yellowing grain<br />
Upon her golden altar; long and long<br />
Before, at end of their delicious song,<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They stripped her of her weed with reverend hands</span><br />
And showed the ivory limbs his hand had wrought;<br />
Yea, and too long e'en then ere those fair bands,<br />
Dispersing here and there, the shadow sought<br />
Of Indian spice-trees o'er the warm sea brought<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>And toward the splashing of the fountain turned,<br />
Mocked the noon sun that o'er the cloisters burned.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when the crowd of worshippers was gone</span><br />
And through the golden dimness of the place<br />
The goddess' very servants paced alone,<br />
Or some lone damsel murmured of her case<br />
Apart from prying eyes, he turned his face<br />
Unto that image made with toil and care,<br />
In days when unto him it seemed most fair.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dusky and dim, though rich with gems and gold,</span><br />
The house of Venus was; high in the dome<br />
The burning sun-light you could now behold,<br />
From nowhere else the light of day might come,<br />
To shame the Shame-faced Mother's lovely home;<br />
A long way off the shrine, the fresh sea-breeze,<br />
Now just arising, brushed the myrtle-trees.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The torches of the flower-crowned, singing band</span><br />
Erewhile, indeed, made more than daylight there,<br />
Lighting the painted tales of many a land,<br />
And carven heroes, with their unused glare;<br />
But now a few soft, glimmering lamps there were<br />
And on the altar a thin, flickering flame<br />
Just showed the golden letters of her name.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blue in the dome yet hung the incense-cloud,</span><br />
And still its perfume lingered all around;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>And, trodden by the light-foot, fervent crowd,<br />
Thick lay the summer flowers upon the ground,<br />
And now from far-off halls uprose the sound<br />
Of Lydian music, and the dancer's cry,<br />
As though some door were opened suddenly.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So there he stood, some help from her to gain,</span><br />
Bewildered by that twilight midst of day;<br />
Downcast with listening to the joyous strain<br />
He had no part in, hopeless with delay<br />
Of all the fair things he had meant to say;<br />
Yet, as the incense on the flame he cast,<br />
From stammering lips and pale these words there passed,&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O thou forgotten help, dost thou yet know</span><br />
What thing it is I need, when even I,<br />
Bent down before thee in this shame and woe,<br />
Can frame no set of words to tell thee why<br />
I needs must pray, O help me or I die!<br />
Or slay me, and in slaying take from me<br />
Even a dead man's feeble memory.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Say not thine help I have been slow to seek;</span><br />
Here have I been from the first hour of morn,<br />
Who stand before thy presence faint and weak,<br />
Of my one poor delight left all forlorn;<br />
Trembling with many fears, the hope outworn<br />
I had when first I left my love, my shame,<br />
To call upon thine oft-sung glorious name."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He stopped to catch his breath, for as a sob</span><br />
Did each word leave his mouth; but suddenly,<br />
Like a live thing, the thin flame 'gan to throb<br />
And gather force, and then shot up on high<br />
A steady spike of light, that drew anigh<br />
The sunbeam in the dome, then sank once more<br />
Into a feeble flicker as before.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But at that sight the nameless hope he had</span><br />
That kept him living midst unhappiness,<br />
Stirred in his breast, and with changed face and glad<br />
Unto the image forward must he press<br />
With words of praise his first word to redress,<br />
But then it was as though a thick black cloud<br />
Altar, and fire, and ivory limbs did shroud.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He staggered back, amazed and full of awe,</span><br />
But when, with anxious eyes, he gazed around,<br />
About him still the worshippers he saw<br />
Sunk in their wonted works, with no surprise<br />
At what to him seemed awful mysteries;<br />
Therewith he sighed and said, "This, too, I dream,<br />
No better day upon my life shall beam."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet for long upon the place he gazed</span><br />
Where other folk beheld the lovely Queen;<br />
And while he looked the dusky veil seemed raised,<br />
And every thing was as it erst had been;<br />
And then he said, "Such marvels I have seen<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>As some sick man may see from off his bed:<br />
Ah, I am sick, and would that I were dead!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therewith, not questioning his heart at all,</span><br />
He turned away and left the holy place,<br />
When now the wide sun reddened towards his fall,<br />
And a fresh west wind held the clouds in chase;<br />
But coming out, at first he hid his face<br />
Dazed with the light, and in the porch he stood,<br />
Nor wished to move, or change his dreary mood.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet in a while the freshness of the eve</span><br />
Pierced to his weary heart, and with a sigh<br />
He raised his head, and slowly 'gan to leave<br />
The high carved pillars; and so presently<br />
Had passed the grove of whispering myrtles by,<br />
And, mid the many noises of the street,<br />
Made himself brave the eyes of men to meet.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thronged were the ways with folk in gay attire,</span><br />
Nursing the end of that festivity;<br />
Girls fit to move the moody man's desire<br />
Brushed past him, and soft dainty minstrelsy<br />
He heard amid the laughter, and might see,<br />
Through open doors, the garden's green delight,<br />
Where pensive lovers waited for the night;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or resting dancers round the fountain drawn,</span><br />
With faces flushed unto the breeze turned round,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>Or wandering o'er the fragrant trodden lawn,<br />
Took up their fallen garlands from the ground,<br />
Or languidly their scattered tresses bound,<br />
Or let their gathered raiment fall adown,<br />
With eyes downcast beneath their lovers' frown.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What hope Pygmalion yet might have, when he</span><br />
First left the pillars of the dreamy place,<br />
Amid such sights had vanished utterly.<br />
He turned his weary eyes from face to face,<br />
Nor noted them, as at a lagging pace<br />
He gat towards home, and still was murmuring,<br />
"Ah life, sweet life! the only godlike thing!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as he went, though longing to be there</span><br />
Whereas his sole desire awaited him,<br />
Yet did he loath to see the image fair,<br />
White and unchanged of face, unmoved of limb,<br />
And to his heart came dreamy thoughts and dim<br />
That unto some strange region he might come,<br />
Nor ever reach again his loveless home.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet soon, indeed, before his door he stood,</span><br />
And, as a man awaking from a dream,<br />
Seemed waked from his old folly; nought seemed good<br />
In all the things that he before had deemed<br />
At least worth life, and on his heart there streamed<br />
Cold light of day&mdash;he found himself alone,<br />
Reft of desire, all love and madness gone.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet for that past folly must he weep,</span><br />
As one might mourn the parted happiness<br />
That, mixed with madness, made him smile in sleep;<br />
And still some lingering sweetness seemed to bless<br />
The hard life left of toil and loneliness,<br />
Like a past song too sweet, too short, and yet<br />
Emmeshed for ever in the memory's net.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Weeping he entered, murmuring, "O fair Queen,</span><br />
I thank thee that my prayer was not for nought,<br />
Truly a present helper hast thou been<br />
To those who faithfully thy throne have sought!<br />
Yet, since with pain deliverance I have bought,<br />
Hast thou not yet some gift in store for me,<br />
That I thine happy slave henceforth may be?"</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">T</span><span class="caps">hus</span> to his chamber at the last he came,</span><br />
And, pushing through the still half-opened door,<br />
He stood within; but there, for very shame<br />
Of all the things that he had done before,<br />
Still kept his eyes bent down upon the floor,<br />
Thinking of all that he had done and said<br />
Since he had wrought that luckless marble maid.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet soft his thoughts were, and the very place</span><br />
Seemed perfumed with some nameless heavenly air<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>So gaining courage, did he raise his face<br />
Unto the work his hands had made so fair,<br />
And cried aloud to see the niche all bare<br />
Of that sweet form, while through his heart again<br />
There shot a pang of his old yearning pain.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet while he stood, and knew not what to do</span><br />
With yearning, a strange thrill of hope there came,<br />
A shaft of new desire now pierced him through,<br />
And therewithal a soft voice called his name,<br />
And when he turned, with eager eyes aflame,<br />
He saw betwixt him and the setting sun<br />
The lively image of his lov&eacute;d one.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He trembled at the sight, for though her eyes,</span><br />
Her very lips, were such as he had made,<br />
And though her tresses fell but in such guise<br />
As he had wrought them, now was she arrayed<br />
In that fair garment that the priests had laid<br />
Upon the goddess on that very morn,<br />
Dyed like the setting sun upon the corn.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Speechless he stood, but she now drew anear,</span><br />
Simple and sweet as she was wont to be,<br />
And all at once her silver voice rang clear,<br />
Filling his soul with great felicity,<br />
And thus she spoke, "Pygmalion, come to me,<br />
O dear companion of my new-found life,<br />
For I am called thy lover and thy wife.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Listen, these words the Dread One bade me say</span><br />
That was with me e'en now, <i>Pygmalion,</i><br />
<i>My new-made soul I give to thee to-day,</i><br />
<i>Come, feel the sweet breath that thy prayer has won,</i><br />
<i>And lay thine hand this heaving breast upon!</i><br />
<i>Come love, and walk with me between the trees,</i><br />
<i>And feel the freshness of the evening breeze.</i><br />
<br />
<i>"Sweep mine hair round thy neck; behold my feet,</i><br />
<i>The oft-kissed feet thou thoughtst should never move,</i><br />
<i>Press down the daisies! draw me to thee, sweet,</i><br />
<i>And feel the warm heart of thy living love</i><br />
<i>Beat against thine, and bless the Seed of Jove</i><br />
<i>Whose loving tender heart hath wrought all this,</i><br />
<i>And wrapped us both in such a cloud of bliss.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ah, thou art wise to know what this may mean!</span><br />
Sweet seem the words to me, and needs must I<br />
Speak all the lesson of the lovely Queen:<br />
But this I know, I would we were more nigh,<br />
I have not heard thy voice but in the cry<br />
Thou utteredst then, when thou believedst gone<br />
The marvel of thine hands, the maid of stone."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She reached her hand to him, and with kind eyes</span><br />
Gazed into his; but he the fingers caught<br />
And drew her to him, and midst ecstasies<br />
Passing all words, yea, well-nigh passing thought,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>Felt that sweet breath that he so long had sought,<br />
Felt the warm life within her heaving breast<br />
As in his arms his living love he pressed.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as his cheek touched hers he heard her say,</span><br />
"Wilt thou not speak, O love? why dost thou weep?<br />
Art thou then sorry for this long-wished day,<br />
Or dost thou think perchance thou wilt not keep<br />
This that thou holdest, but in dreamy sleep?<br />
Nay, let us do the bidding of the Queen,<br />
And hand in hand walk through thy garden green;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Then shalt thou tell me, still beholding me,</span><br />
Full many things whereof I wish to know,<br />
And as we walk from whispering tree to tree<br />
Still more familiar to thee shall I grow,<br />
And such things shalt thou say unto me now<br />
As when thou deemedst thou wast quite alone,<br />
A madman, kneeling to a thing of stone."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But at that word a smile lit up his eyes</span><br />
And therewithal he spake some loving word,<br />
And she at first looked up in grave surprise<br />
When his deep voice and musical she heard,<br />
And clung to him as grown somewhat afeard;<br />
Then cried aloud and said, "O mighty one!<br />
What joy with thee to look upon the sun."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then into that fair garden did they pass</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>And all the story of his love he told,<br />
And as the twain went o'er the dewy grass,<br />
Beneath the risen moon could he behold<br />
The bright tears trickling down, then, waxen bold,<br />
He stopped and said, "Ah, love, what meaneth this?<br />
Seest thou how tears still follow earthly bliss?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then both her white arms round his neck she threw</span><br />
And sobbing said, "O love, what hurteth me?<br />
When first the sweetness of my life I knew,<br />
Not this I felt, but when I first saw thee<br />
A little pain and great felicity<br />
Rose up within me, and thy talk e'en now<br />
Made pain and pleasure ever greater grow?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O sweet," he said, "this thing is even love,</span><br />
Whereof I told thee; that all wise men fear,<br />
But yet escape not; nay, to gods above,<br />
Unless the old tales lie, it draweth near.<br />
But let my happy ears I pray thee hear<br />
Thy story too, and how thy blessed birth<br />
Has made a heaven of this once lonely earth."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"My sweet," she said, "as yet I am not wise,</span><br />
Or stored with words, aright the tale to tell,<br />
But listen: when I opened first mine eyes<br />
I stood within the niche thou knowest well,<br />
And from mine hand a heavy thing there fell<br />
Carved like these flowers, nor could I see things clear,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>And but a strange confus&egrave;d noise could hear.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"At last mine eyes could see a woman fair,</span><br />
But awful as this round white moon o'erhead.<br />
So that I trembled when I saw her there,<br />
For with my life was born some touch of dread,<br />
And therewithal I heard her voice that said,<br />
'Come down, and learn to love and be alive,<br />
For thee, a well-prized gift, to-day I give.'<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Then on the floor I stepped, rejoicing much,</span><br />
Not knowing why, not knowing aught at all,<br />
Till she reached out her hand my breast to touch,<br />
And when her fingers thereupon did fall,<br />
Thought came unto my life, and therewithal<br />
I knew her for a goddess, and began<br />
To murmur in some tongue unknown to man.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And then indeed not in this guise was I,</span><br />
No sandals had I, and no saffron gown,<br />
But naked as thou knowest utterly,<br />
E'en as my limbs beneath thine hand had grown,<br />
And this fair perfumed robe then fell adown<br />
Over the goddess' feet and swept the ground,<br />
And round her loins a glittering belt was bound.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But when the stammering of my tongue she heard</span><br />
Upon my trembling lips her hand she laid,<br />
And spoke again, 'Nay, say not any word,<br />
All that thine heart would say I know unsaid,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>Who even now thine heart and voice have made;<br />
But listen rather, for thou knowest now<br />
What these words mean, and still wilt wiser grow.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'Thy body, lifeless till I gave it life,</span><br />
A certain man, my servant, well hath wrought<br />
I give thee to him as his love and wife,<br />
With all thy dowry of desire and thought,<br />
Since this his yearning heart hath ever sought;<br />
Now from my temple is he on the way,<br />
Deeming to find thee e'en as yesterday;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'Bide thou his coming by the bed-head there,</span><br />
And when thou seest him set his eyes upon<br />
Thine empty niche, and hear'st him cry for care,<br />
Then call him by his name, Pygmalion,<br />
And certainly thy lover hast thou won;<br />
But when he stands before thee silently,<br />
Say all these words that I shall teach to thee.'<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"With that she said what first I told thee, love</span><br />
And then went on, 'Moreover thou shalt say<br />
That I, the daughter of almighty Jove,<br />
Have wrought for him this long-desired day;<br />
In sign whereof, these things that pass away,<br />
Wherein mine image men have well arrayed,<br />
I give thee for thy wedding gear, O maid.'<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Therewith her raiment she put off from her.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>And laid bare all her perfect loveliness,<br />
And, smiling on me, came yet more anear,<br />
And on my mortal lips her lips did press,<br />
And said, 'Now herewith shalt thou love no less<br />
Than Psyche loved my son in days of old;<br />
Farewell, of thee shall many a tale be told.'<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And even with that last word was she gone,</span><br />
How, I know not, and I my limbs arrayed<br />
In her fair gift, and waited thee alone&mdash;<br />
Ah, love, indeed the word is true she said,<br />
For now I love thee so, I grow afraid<br />
Of what the gods upon our heads may send&mdash;<br />
I love thee so, I think upon the end."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What words he said? How can I tell again</span><br />
What words they said beneath the glimmering light,<br />
Some tongue they used unknown to loveless men<br />
As each to each they told their great delight,<br />
Until for stillness of the growing night<br />
Their soft sweet murmuring words seemed growing loud<br />
And dim the moon grew, hid by fleecy cloud.</p></div>

The rougher voices of the toiling men<br />

<h2>OGIER THE DANE.</h2>

<h3>ARGUMENT.</h3>

<p class="hang">When Ogier was born, six fay ladies came to the cradle where he lay,
and gave him various gifts, as to be brave and happy and the like; but
the sixth gave him to be her love when he should have lived long in
the world: so Ogier grew up and became the greatest of knights, and at
last, after many years, fell into the hands of that fay, and with her,
as the story tells, he lives now, though he returned once to the
world, as is shown in the process of this tale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">W</span><span class="caps">ithin</span> some Danish city by the sea,</span><br />
Whose name, changed now, is all unknown to me,<br />
Great mourning was there one fair summer eve,<br />
Because the angels, bidden to receive<br />
The fair Queen's lovely soul in Paradise,<br />
Had done their bidding, and in royal guise<br />
Her helpless body, once the prize of love,<br />
Unable now for fear or hope to move,<br />
Lay underneath the golden canopy;<br />
And bowed down by unkingly misery<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>The King sat by it, and not far away,<br />
Within the chamber a fair man-child lay,<br />
His mother's bane, the king that was to be,<br />
Not witting yet of any royalty,<br />
Harmless and loved, although so new to life.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Calm the June evening was, no sign of strife</span><br />
The clear sky showed, no storm grew round the sun,<br />
Unhappy that his day of bliss was done;<br />
Dumb was the sea, and if the beech-wood stirred,<br />
'Twas with the nestling of the grey-winged bird<br />
Midst its thick leaves; and though the nightingale<br />
Her ancient, hapless sorrow must bewail,<br />
No more of woe there seemed within her song<br />
Than such as doth to lovers' words belong,<br />
Because their love is still unsatisfied.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But to the King, on that sweet eventide,</span><br />
No earth there seemed, no heaven when earth was gone;<br />
No help, no God! but lonely pain alone;<br />
And he, midst unreal shadows, seemed to sit<br />
Himself the very heart and soul of it.<br />
But round the cradle of the new-born child<br />
The nurses now the weary time beguiled<br />
With stories of the just departed Queen;<br />
And how, amid the heathen folk first seen,<br />
She had been won to love and godliness;<br />
And as they spoke, e'en midst his dull distress,<br />
An eager whisper now and then did smite<br />
Upon the King's ear, of some past delight,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>Some once familiar name, and he would raise<br />
His weary head, and on the speaker gaze<br />
Like one about to speak, but soon again<br />
Would drop his head and be alone with pain,<br />
Nor think of these; who, silent in their turn,<br />
Would sit and watch the waxen tapers burn<br />
Amidst the dusk of the quick-gathering night,<br />
Until beneath the high stars' glimmering light,<br />
The fresh earth lay in colourless repose.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So passed the night, and now and then one rose</span><br />
From out her place to do what might avail<br />
To still the new-born infant's fretful wail;<br />
Or through the softly-opened door there came<br />
Some nurse new waked, who, whispering low the name<br />
Of her whose turn was come, would take her place;<br />
Then toward the King would turn about her face<br />
And to her fellows whisper of the day,<br />
And tell again of her just past away.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So waned the hours, the moon arose and grew,</span><br />
From off the sea a little west-wind blew,<br />
Rustling the garden-leaves like sudden rain;<br />
And ere the moon began to fall again<br />
The wind grew cold, a change was in the sky,<br />
And in deep silence did the dawn draw nigh:<br />
Then from her place a nurse arose to light<br />
Fresh hallowed lights, for, dying with the night,<br />
The tapers round about the dead Queen were;<br />
But the King raised his head and 'gan to stare<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>Upon her, as her sweeping gown did glide<br />
About the floor, that in the stillness cried<br />
Beneath her careful feet; and now as she<br />
Had lit the second candle carefully,<br />
And on its silver spike another one<br />
Was setting, through her body did there run<br />
A sudden tremor, and the hand was stayed<br />
That on the dainty painted wax was laid;<br />
Her eyelids fell down and she seemed to sleep,<br />
And o'er the staring King began to creep<br />
Sweet slumber too; the bitter lines of woe<br />
That drew his weary face did softer grow,<br />
His eyelids dropped, his arms fell to his side;<br />
And moveless in their places did abide<br />
The nursing women, held by some strong spell,<br />
E'en as they were, and utter silence fell<br />
Upon the mournful, glimmering chamber fair.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now light footsteps coming up the stair,</span><br />
Smote on the deadly stillness, and the sound<br />
Of silken dresses trailing o'er the ground;<br />
And heavenly odours through the chamber passed,<br />
Unlike the scents that rose and lily cast<br />
Upon the freshness of the dying night;<br />
Then nigher drew the sound of footsteps light<br />
Until the door swung open noiselessly&mdash;<br />
A mass of sunlit flowers there seemed to be<br />
Within the doorway, and but pale and wan<br />
The flame showed now that serveth mortal man,<br />
As one by one six seeming ladies passed<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>Into the room, and o'er its sorrow cast<br />
That thoughtless sense of joy bewildering,<br />
That kisses youthful hearts amidst of spring;<br />
Crowned were they, in such glorious raiment clad,<br />
As yet no merchant of the world has had<br />
Within his coffers; yet those crowns seemed fair<br />
Only because they kissed their odorous hair,<br />
And all that flowery raiment was but blessed<br />
By those fair bodies that its splendour pressed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now to the cradle from that glorious band,</span><br />
A woman passed, and laid a tender hand<br />
Upon the babe, and gently drew aside<br />
The swathings soft that did his body hide;<br />
And, seeing him so fair and great, she smiled,<br />
And stooped, and kissed him, saying, "O noble child,<br />
Have thou a gift from Gloriande this day;<br />
For to the time when life shall pass away<br />
From this dear heart, no fear of death or shame,<br />
No weariness of good shall foul thy name."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So saying, to her sisters she returned;</span><br />
And one came forth, upon whose brow there burned<br />
A crown of rubies, and whose heaving breast<br />
With happy rings a golden hauberk pressed;<br />
She took the babe, and somewhat frowning said,<br />
"This gift I give, that till thy limbs are laid<br />
At rest for ever, to thine honoured life<br />
There never shall be lacking war and strife,<br />
That thou a long-enduring name mayst win,<br />
And by thy deeds, good pardon for thy sin."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">With that another, who, unseen, meanwhile</span><br />
Had drawn anigh, said with a joyous smile,<br />
"And this forgotten gift to thee I give,<br />
That while amidst the turmoil thou dost live,<br />
Still shalt thou win the game, and unto thee<br />
Defeat and shame but idle words shall be."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then back they turned, and therewithal, the fourth</span><br />
Said, "Take this gift for what it may be worth<br />
For that is mine to give; lo, thou shalt be<br />
Gentle of speech, and in all courtesy<br />
The first of men: a little gift this is,<br />
After these promises of fame and bliss."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then toward the babe the fifth fair woman went;</span><br />
Grey-eyed she was, and simple, with eyes bent<br />
Down on the floor, parted her red lips were,<br />
And o'er her sweet face marvellously fair<br />
Oft would the colour spread full suddenly;<br />
Clad in a dainty gown and thin was she,<br />
For some green summer of the fay-land dight,<br />
Tripping she went, and laid her fingers light<br />
Upon the child, and said, "O little one,<br />
As long as thou shalt look upon the sun<br />
Shall women long for thee; take heed to this<br />
And give them what thou canst of love and bliss."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, blushing for her words, therefrom she past,</span><br />
And by the cradle stood the sixth and last,<br />
The fairest of them all; awhile she gazed<br />
Down on the child, and then her hand she raised,<br />
And made the one side of her bosom bare;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>"Ogier," she said, "if this be foul or fair<br />
Thou know'st not now, but when thine earthly life<br />
Is drunk out to the dregs, and war and strife<br />
Have yielded thee whatever joy they may,<br />
Thine head upon this bosom shalt thou lay;<br />
And then, despite of knowledge or of God,<br />
Will we be glad upon the flowery sod<br />
Within the happy country where I dwell:<br />
Ogier, my love that is to be, farewell!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She turned, and even as they came they passed</span><br />
From out the place, and reached the gate at last<br />
That oped before their feet, and speedily<br />
They gained the edges of the murmuring sea,<br />
And as they stood in silence, gazing there<br />
Out to the west, they vanished into air,<br />
I know not how, nor whereto they returned.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But mixed with twilight in the chamber burned</span><br />
The flickering candles, and those dreary folk,<br />
Unlike to sleepers, from their trance awoke,<br />
But nought of what had happed meanwhile they knew<br />
Through the half-opened casements now there blew<br />
A sweet fresh air, that of the flowers and sea<br />
Mingled together, smelt deliciously,<br />
And from the unseen sun the spreading light<br />
Began to make the fair June blossoms bright,<br />
And midst their weary woe uprose the sun,<br />
And thus has Ogier's noble life begun.</p></div>

He ruled o'er kingdoms where his name no more<br />
Is had in memory, and on many a shore<br />
He left his sweat and blood to win a name<br />
Passing the bounds of earthly creatures' fame.<br />
A love he won and lost, a well-loved son<br />
Whose little day of promise soon was done:<br />
A tender wife he had, that he must leave<br />
Before his heart her love could well receive;<br />
Those promised gifts, that on his careless head<br />
In those first hours of his fair life were shed<br />
He took unwitting, and unwitting spent,<br />
Nor gave himself to grief and discontent<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>Because he saw the end a-drawing nigh.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where is he now? in what land must he die,</span><br />
To leave an empty name to us on earth?<br />
A tale half true, to cast across our mirth<br />
Some pensive thoughts of life that might have been;<br />
Where is he now, that all this life has seen?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Behold, another eve upon the earth</span><br />
Than that calm evening of the warrior's birth;<br />
The sun is setting in the west, the sky<br />
Is bright and clear and hard, and no clouds lie<br />
About the golden circle of the sun;<br />
But East, aloof from him, heavy and dun<br />
Steel-grey they pack with edges red as blood,<br />
And underneath them is the weltering flood<br />
Of some huge sea, whose tumbling hills, as they<br />
Turn restless sides about, are black or grey,<br />
Or green, or glittering with the golden flame;<br />
The wind has fallen now, but still the same<br />
The mighty army moves, as if to drown<br />
This lone, bare rock, whose shear scarped sides of brown<br />
Cast off the weight of waves in clouds of spray.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Alas! what ships upon an evil day</span><br />
Bent over to the wind in this ill sea?<br />
What navy, whose rent bones lie wretchedly<br />
Beneath these cliffs? a mighty one it was,<br />
A fearful storm to bring such things to pass.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This is the loadstone rock; no armament</span><br />
Of warring nations, in their madness bent<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>Their course this way; no merchant wittingly<br />
Has steered his keel unto this luckless sea;<br />
Upon no shipman's card its name is writ,<br />
Though worn-out mariners will speak of it<br />
Within the ingle on the winter's night,<br />
When all within is warm and safe and bright,<br />
And the wind howls without: but 'gainst their will<br />
Are some folk driven here, and then all skill<br />
Against this evil rock is vain and nought,<br />
And unto death the shipmen soon are brought;<br />
For then the keel, as by a giant's hand,<br />
Is drawn unto that mockery of a land,<br />
And presently unto its sides doth cleave;<br />
When if they 'scape swift death, yet none may leave<br />
The narrow limits of that barren isle,<br />
And thus are slain by famine in a while<br />
Mocked, as they say, by night with images<br />
Of noble castles among groves of trees,<br />
By day with sounds of merry minstrelsy.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sun sinks now below this hopeless sea,</span><br />
The clouds are gone, and all the sky is bright;<br />
The moon is rising o'er the growing night,<br />
And by its shine may ye behold the bones<br />
Of generations of these luckless ones<br />
Scattered about the rock; but nigh the sea<br />
Sits one alive, who uncomplainingly<br />
Awaits his death. White-haired is he and old,<br />
Arrayed in royal raiment, bright with gold,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>But tarnished with the waves and rough salt air;<br />
Huge is he, of a noble face and fair,<br />
As for an ancient man, though toil and eld<br />
Furrow the cheeks that ladies once beheld<br />
With melting hearts&mdash;Nay, listen, for he speaks!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"God, Thou hast made me strong! nigh seven weeks</span><br />
Have passed since from the wreck we haled our store,<br />
And five long days well told, have now passed o'er<br />
Since my last fellow died, with my last bread<br />
Between his teeth, and yet I am not dead.<br />
Yea, but for this I had been strong enow<br />
In some last bloody field my sword to show.<br />
What matter? soon will all be past and done,<br />
Where'er I died I must have died alone:<br />
Yet, Caraheu, a good death had it been<br />
Dying, thy face above me to have seen,<br />
And heard my banner flapping in the wind,<br />
Then, though my memory had not left thy mind,<br />
Yet hope and fear would not have vexed thee more<br />
When thou hadst known that everything was o'er;<br />
But now thou waitest, still expecting me,<br />
Whose sail shall never speck thy bright blue sea.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And thou, Clarice, the merchants thou mayst call,</span><br />
To tell thee tales within thy pictured hall,<br />
But never shall they tell true tales of me:<br />

No more on my sails shall they look adown.<br />

Husbands and children, other friends and wives,<br />

A little thing indeed it seems to be<br />
To give this life up, since it needs must go<br />
Some time or other; now at last I know<br />
How foolishly men play upon the earth,<br />
When unto them a year of life seems worth<br />
Honour and friends, and these vague hopes and sweet<br />
That like real things my dying heart do greet,<br />
Unreal while living on the earth I trod,<br />
And but myself I knew no other god.<br />
Behold, I thank Thee that Thou sweet'nest thus<br />

If of another I had heard it told."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What man is this, who weak and worn and old</span><br />
Gives up his life within that dreadful isle,<br />
And on the fearful coming death can smile?<br />
Alas! this man, so battered and outworn,<br />
Is none but he, who, on that summer morn,<br />
Received such promises of glorious life:<br />
Ogier the Dane this is, to whom all strife<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>Was but as wine to stir awhile the blood,<br />
To whom all life, however hard, was good:<br />
This is the man, unmatched of heart and limb,<br />
Ogier the Dane, whose sight has waxed not dim<br />
For all the years that he on earth has dwelt;<br />
Ogier the Dane, that never fear has felt,<br />
Since he knew good from ill; Ogier the Dane,<br />
The heathen's dread, the evil-doer's bane.</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">B</span><span class="caps">right</span> had the moon grown as his words were done,</span><br />
And no more was there memory of the sun<br />
Within the west, and he grew drowsy now.<br />
And somewhat smoother was his wrinkled brow<br />
As thought died out beneath the hand of sleep,<br />
And o'er his soul forgetfulness did creep,<br />
Hiding the image of swift-coming death;<br />
Until as peacefully he drew his breath<br />
As on that day, past for a hundred years,<br />
When, midst the nurse's quickly-falling tears,<br />
He fell asleep to his first lullaby.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The night changed as he slept, white clouds and high</span><br />
Began about the lonely moon to close;<br />
And from the dark west a new wind arose,<br />
And with the sound of heavy-falling waves<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>Mingled its pipe about the loadstone caves;<br />
But when the twinkling stars were hid away,<br />
And a faint light and broad, like dawn of day,<br />
The moon upon that dreary country shed,<br />
Ogier awoke, and lifting up his head<br />
And smiling, muttered, "Nay, no more again;<br />
Rather some pleasure new, some other pain,<br />
Unthought of both, some other form of strife;"<br />
For he had waked from dreams of his old life,<br />
And through St. Omer's archer-guarded gate<br />
Once more had seemed to pass, and saw the state<br />
Of that triumphant king; and still, though all<br />
Seemed changed, and folk by other names did call<br />
Faces he knew of old, yet none the less<br />
He seemed the same, and, midst that mightiness,<br />
Felt his own power, and grew the more athirst<br />
For coming glory, as of old, when first<br />
He stood before the face of Charlemaine,<br />
A helpless hostage with all life to gain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now, awake, his worn face once more sank</span><br />
Between his hands, and, murmuring not, he drank<br />
The draught of death that must that thirst allay.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But while he sat and waited for the day</span><br />
A sudden light across the bare rock streamed,<br />
Which at the first he noted not, but deemed<br />
The moon her fleecy veil had broken through;<br />
But ruddier indeed this new light grew<br />
Than were the moon's grey beams, and, therewithal<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>Soft far-off music on his ears did fall;<br />
Yet moved he not, but murmured, "This is death.<br />
An easy thing like this to yield my breath,<br />
Awake, yet dreaming, with no sounds of fear,<br />
No dreadful sights to tell me it is near;<br />
Yea, God, I thank Thee!" but with that last word<br />
It seemed to him that he his own name heard<br />
Whispered, as though the wind had borne it past;<br />
With that he gat unto his feet at last,<br />
But still awhile he stood, with sunken head,<br />
And in a low and trembling voice he said,<br />
"Lord, I am ready, whither shall I go?<br />
I pray Thee unto me some token show."<br />
And, as he said this, round about he turned,<br />
And in the east beheld a light that burned<br />
As bright as day; then, though his flesh might fear<br />
The coming change that he believed so near,<br />
Yet did his soul rejoice, for now he thought<br />
Unto the very heaven to be brought:<br />
And though he felt alive, deemed it might be<br />
That he in sleep had died full easily.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then toward that light did he begin to go,</span><br />
And still those strains he heard, far off and low,<br />
That grew no louder; still that bright light streamed<br />
Over the rocks, yet nothing brighter seemed,<br />
But like the light of some unseen bright flame<br />
Shone round about, until at last he came<br />
Unto the dreary islet's other shore,<br />
And then the minstrelsy he heard no more,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>And softer seemed the strange light unto him,<br />
But yet or ever it had grown quite dim,<br />
Beneath its waning light could he behold<br />
A mighty palace set about with gold,<br />
Above green meads and groves of summer trees<br />
Far-off across the welter of the seas;<br />
But, as he gazed, it faded from his sight,<br />
And the grey hidden moon's diffused soft light,<br />
Which soothly was but darkness to him now,<br />
His sea-girt island prison did but show.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But o'er the sea he still gazed wistfully,</span><br />
And said, "Alas! and when will this go by<br />
And leave my soul in peace? must I still dream<br />
Of life that once so dear a thing did seem,<br />
That, when I wake, death may the bitterer be?<br />
Here will I sit until he come to me,<br />
And hide mine eyes and think upon my sin,<br />
That so a little calm I yet may win<br />
Before I stand within the awful place."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then down he sat and covered up his face.</span><br />
Yet therewithal his trouble could not hide,<br />
Nor waiting thus for death could he abide,<br />
For, though he knew it not, the yearning pain<br />
Of hope of life had touched his soul again&mdash;<br />
If he could live awhile, if he could live!<br />
The mighty being, who once was wont to give<br />
The gift of life to many a trembling man;<br />
Who did his own will since his life began;<br />
Who feared not aught, but strong and great and free<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>Still cast aside the thought of what might be;<br />
Must all this then be lost, and with no will,<br />
Powerless and blind, must he some fate fulfil,<br />
Nor know what he is doing any more?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon he arose and paced along the shore,</span><br />
And gazed out seaward for the blessed light;<br />
But nought he saw except the old sad sight,<br />
The ceaseless tumbling of the billows grey,<br />
The white upspringing of the spurts of spray<br />
Amidst that mass of timbers, the rent bones<br />
Of the sea-houses of the hapless ones<br />
Once cast like him upon this deadly isle.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He stopped his pacing in a little while,</span><br />
And clenched his mighty hands, and set his teeth,<br />
And gazing at the ruin underneath,<br />
He swung from off the bare cliff's jagged brow,<br />
And on some slippery ledge he wavered now,<br />
Without a hand-hold, and now stoutly clung<br />
With hands alone, and o'er the welter hung,<br />
Not caring aught if thus his life should end;<br />
But safely amidst all this did he descend<br />
The dreadful cliff, and since no beach was there,<br />
But from the depths the rock rose stark and bare,<br />
Nor crumbled aught beneath the hammering sea,<br />
Upon the wrecks he stood unsteadily.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now, amid the clamour of the waves,</span><br />
And washing to-and-fro of beams and staves,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>Dizzy with hunger, dreamy with distress,<br />
And all those days of fear and loneliness,<br />
The ocean's tumult seemed the battle's roar,<br />
His heart grew hot, as when in days of yore<br />
He heard the cymbals clash amid the crowd<br />
Of dusky faces; now he shouted loud,<br />
And from crushed beam to beam began to leap,<br />
And yet his footing somehow did he keep<br />
Amidst their tossing, and indeed the sea<br />
Was somewhat sunk upon the island's lee.<br />
So quickly on from wreck to wreck he passed,<br />
And reached the outer line of wrecks at last,<br />
And there a moment stood unsteadily,<br />
Amid the drift of spray that hurried by,<br />
And drew Courtain his sword from out its sheath,<br />
And poised himself to meet the coming death,<br />
Still looking out to sea; but as he gazed,<br />
And once or twice his doubtful feet he raised<br />
To take the final plunge, that heavenly strain<br />
Over the washing waves he heard again,<br />
And from the dimness something bright he saw<br />
Across the waste of waters towards him draw;<br />
And hidden now, now raised aloft, at last<br />
Unto his very feet a boat was cast,<br />
Gilded inside and out, and well arrayed<br />
With cushions soft; far fitter to have weighed<br />
From some sweet garden on the shallow Seine,<br />
Or in a reach of green Thames to have lain,<br />
Than struggle with that huge confus&eacute;d sea;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>But Ogier gazed upon it doubtfully<br />
One moment, and then, sheathing Courtain, said,<br />
"What tales are these about the newly dead<br />
The heathen told? what matter, let all pass;<br />
This moment as one dead indeed I was,<br />
And this must be what I have got to do,<br />
I yet perchance may light on something new<br />
Before I die; though yet perchance this keel<br />
Unto the wondrous mass of charm&eacute;d steel<br />
Is drawn as others." With that word he leapt<br />
Into the boat, and o'er the cushions crept<br />
From stem to stern, but found no rudder there,<br />
Nor any oars, nor were the cushions fair<br />
Made wet by any dashing of the sea.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now while he pondered how these things could be,</span><br />
The boat began to move therefrom at last,<br />
But over him a drowsiness was cast,<br />
And as o'er tumbling hills the skiff did pass,<br />
He clean forgot his death and where he was.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last he woke up to a sunny day,</span><br />
And, looking round, saw that his shallop lay<br />
Moored at the edge of some fair tideless sea<br />
Unto an overhanging thick-leaved tree,<br />
Where in the green waves did the low bank dip<br />
Its fresh and green grass-covered daisied lip;<br />
But Ogier looking thence no more could see<br />
That sad abode of death and misery,<br />
Nor aught but wide and empty ocean, grey<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>With gathering haze, for now it neared midday;<br />
Then from the golden cushions did he rise,<br />
And wondering still if this were Paradise<br />
He stepped ashore, but drew Courtain his sword<br />
And muttered therewithal a holy word.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fair was the place, as though amidst of May,</span><br />
Nor did the brown birds fear the sunny day,<br />
For with their quivering song the air was sweet;<br />
Thick grew the field-flowers underneath his feet,<br />
And on his head the blossoms down did rain,<br />
Yet mid these fair things slowly and with pain<br />
He 'gan to go, yea, even when his foot<br />
First touched the flowery sod, to his heart's root<br />
A coldness seemed to strike, and now each limb<br />
Was growing stiff, his eyes waxed bleared and dim,<br />
And all his stored-up memory 'gan to fail,<br />
Nor yet would his once mighty heart avail<br />
For lamentations o'er his chang&eacute;d lot;<br />
Yet urged by some desire, he knew not what,<br />
Along a little path 'twixt hedges sweet,<br />
Drawn sword in hand, he dragged his faltering feet,<br />
For what then seemed to him a weary way,<br />
Whereon his steps he needs must often stay<br />
And lean upon the mighty well-worn sword<br />
That in those hands, grown old, for king or lord<br />
Had small respect in glorious days long past.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But still he crept along, and at the last</span><br />
Came to a gilded wicket, and through this<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>Entered a garden fit for utmost bliss,<br />
If that might last which needs must soon go by:<br />
There 'gainst a tree he leaned, and with a sigh<br />
He said, "O God, a sinner I have been,<br />
And good it is that I these things have seen<br />
Before I meet what Thou hast set apart<br />
To cleanse the earthly folly from my heart;<br />
But who within this garden now can dwell<br />
Wherein guilt first upon the world befell?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A little further yet he staggered on,</span><br />
Till to a fountain-side at last he won,<br />
O'er which two white-thorns their sweet blossoms shed.<br />
There he sank down, and laid his weary head<br />
Beside the mossy roots, and in a while<br />
He slept, and dreamed himself within the isle;<br />
That splashing fount the weary sea did seem,<br />
And in his dream the fair place but a dream;<br />
But when again to feebleness he woke<br />
Upon his ears that heavenly music broke,<br />
Not faint or far as in the isle it was,<br />
But e'en as though the minstrels now did pass<br />
Anigh his resting-place; then fallen in doubt,<br />
E'en as he might, he rose and gazed about,<br />
Leaning against the hawthorn stem with pain;<br />
And yet his straining gaze was but in vain,<br />
Death stole so fast upon him, and no more<br />
Could he behold the blossoms as before,<br />
No more the trees seemed rooted to the ground,<br />
A heavy mist seemed gathering all around,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>And in its heart some bright thing seemed to be,<br />
And round his head there breathed deliciously<br />
Sweet odours, and that music never ceased.<br />
But as the weight of Death's strong hand increased<br />
Again he sank adown, and Courtain's noise<br />
Within the scabbard seemed a farewell voice<br />
Sent from the world he loved so well of old,<br />
And all his life was as a story told,<br />
And as he thought thereof he 'gan to smile<br />
E'en as a child asleep, but in a while<br />
It was as though he slept, and sleeping dreamed,<br />
For in his half-closed eyes a glory gleamed,<br />
As though from some sweet face and golden hair,<br />
And on his breast were laid soft hands and fair,<br />
And a sweet voice was ringing in his ears,<br />
Broken as if with flow of joyous tears;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ogier, sweet friend, hast thou not tarried long?</span><br />
Alas! thine hundred years of strife and wrong!"<br />
Then he found voice to say, "Alas! dear Lord,<br />
Too long, too long; and yet one little word<br />
Right many a year agone had brought me here."<br />
Then to his face that face was drawn anear,<br />
He felt his head raised up and gently laid<br />
On some kind knee, again the sweet voice said,<br />
"Nay, Ogier, nay, not yet, not yet, dear friend!<br />
Who knoweth when our link&eacute;d life shall end,<br />
Since thou art come unto mine arms at last,<br />
And all the turmoil of the world is past?<br />
Why do I linger ere I see thy face<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>As I desired it in that mourning place<br />
So many years ago&mdash;so many years,<br />
Thou knewest not thy love and all her fears?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Alas!" he said, "what mockery then is this</span><br />
That thou wilt speak to me of earthly bliss?<br />
No longer can I think upon the earth,<br />
Have I not done with all its grief and mirth?<br />
Yes, I was Ogier once, but if my love<br />
Should come once more my dying heart to move,<br />
Then must she come from 'neath the milk-white walls<br />
Whereon to-day the hawthorn blossom falls<br />
Outside St. Omer's&mdash;art thou she? her name<br />
Which I remembered once mid death and fame<br />
Is clean forgotten now; but yesterday,<br />
Meseems, our son, upon her bosom lay:<br />
Baldwin the fair&mdash;what hast thou done with him<br />
Since Charlot slew him? All, mine eyes wax dim;<br />
Woman, forbear! wilt thou not let me die?<br />
Did I forget thee in the days gone by?<br />
Then let me die, that we may meet again!"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He tried to move from her, but all in vain,</span><br />
For life had well-nigh left him, but withal<br />
He felt a kiss upon his forehead fall,<br />
And could not speak; he felt slim fingers fair<br />
Move to his mighty sword-worn hand, and there<br />
Set on some ring, and still he could not speak,<br />
And once more sleep weighed down his eyelids weak.</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">B</span><span class="caps">ut,</span> ah! what land was this he woke unto?</span><br />
What joy was this that filled his heart anew?<br />
Had he then gained the very Paradise?<br />
Trembling, he durst not at the first arise,<br />
Although no more he felt the pain of eld,<br />
Nor durst he raise his eyes that now beheld<br />
Beside him the white flowers and blades of grass;<br />
He durst not speak, lest he some monster was.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But while he lay and hoped, that gentle voice</span><br />
Once more he heard; "Yea, thou mayst well rejoice<br />
Thou livest still, my sweet, thou livest still,<br />
Apart from every earthly fear and ill;<br />
Wilt thou not love me, who have wrought thee this,<br />
That I like thee may live in double bliss?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Ogier rose up, nowise like to one</span><br />
Whose span of earthly life is nigh outrun,<br />
But as he might have risen in old days<br />
To see the spears cleave the fresh morning haze;<br />
But, looking round, he saw no change there was<br />
In the fair place wherethrough he first did pass,<br />
Though all, grown clear and joyous to his eyes,<br />
Now looked no worse than very Paradise;<br />
Behind him were the thorns, the fountain fair<br />
Still sent its glittering stream forth into air,<br />
And by its basin a fair woman stood,<br />
And as their eyes met his new-heal&eacute;d blood<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>Rushed to his face; with unused thoughts and sweet<br />
And hurrying hopes, his heart began to beat.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fairest of all creatures did she seem;</span><br />
So fresh and delicate you well might deem<br />
That scarce for eighteen summers had she blessed<br />
The happy, longing world; yet, for the rest,<br />
Within her glorious eyes such wisdom dwelt<br />
A child before her had the wise man felt,<br />
And with the pleasure of a thousand years<br />
Her lips were fashioned to move joy or tears<br />
Among the longing folk where she might dwell,<br />
To give at last the kiss unspeakable.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In such wise was she clad as folk may be,</span><br />
Who, for no shame of their humanity,<br />
For no sad changes of the imperfect year,<br />
Rather for added beauty, raiment wear;<br />
For, as the heat-foretelling grey-blue haze<br />
Veils the green flowery morn of late May-days,<br />
Her raiment veiled her; where the bands did meet<br />
That bound the sandals to her dainty feet,<br />
Gems gleamed; a fresh rose-wreath embraced her head,<br />
And on her breast there lay a ruby red.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So with a supplicating look she turned</span><br />
To meet the flame that in his own eyes burned,<br />
And held out both her white arms lovingly,<br />
As though to greet him as he drew anigh.<br />
Stammering he said, "Who art thou? how am I<br />
So cured of all my evils suddenly,<br />
That certainly I felt no mightier, when,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>Amid the backward rush of beaten men,<br />
About me drooped the axe-torn Oriflamme?<br />
Alas! I fear that in some dream I am."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ogier," she said, "draw near, perchance it is</span><br />
That such a name God gives unto our bliss;<br />
I know not, but if thou art such an one<br />
As I must deem, all days beneath the sun<br />
That thou hadst had, shall be but dreams indeed<br />
To those that I have given thee at thy need.<br />
For many years ago beside the sea<br />
When thou wert born, I plighted troth with thee:<br />
Come near then, and make mirrors of mine eyes,<br />
That thou mayst see what these my mysteries<br />
Have wrought in thee; surely but thirty years,<br />
Passed amidst joy, thy new born body bears,<br />
Nor while thou art with me, and on this shore<br />
Art still full-fed of love, shalt thou seem more.<br />
Nay, love, come nigher, and let me take thine hand,<br />
The hope and fear of many a warring land,<br />
And I will show thee wherein lies the spell,<br />
Whereby this happy change upon thee fell."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a shy youth before some royal love,</span><br />
Close up to that fair woman did he move,<br />
And their hands met; yet to his chang&eacute;d voice<br />
He dared not trust; nay, scarcely could rejoice<br />
E'en when her balmy breath he 'gan to feel,<br />
And felt strange sweetness o'er his spirit steal<br />
As her light raiment, driven by the wind,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>Swept round him, and, bewildered and half-blind<br />
His lips the treasure of her lips did press,<br />
And round him clung her perfect loveliness.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For one sweet moment thus they stood, and then</span><br />
She drew herself from out his arms again,<br />
And panting, lovelier for her love, did stand<br />
Apart awhile, then took her lover's hand,<br />
And, in a trembling voice, made haste to say,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O Ogier, when thou camest here to-day,</span><br />
I feared indeed, that in my play with fate,<br />
I might have seen thee e'en one day too late,<br />
Before this ring thy finger should embrace;<br />
Behold it, love, and thy keen eyes may trace<br />
Faint figures wrought upon the ruddy gold;<br />
My father dying gave it me, nor told<br />
The manner of its making, but I know<br />
That it can make thee e'en as thou art now<br />
Despite the laws of God&mdash;shrink not from me<br />
Because I give an impious gift to thee&mdash;<br />
Has not God made me also, who do this?<br />
But I, who longed to share with thee my bliss,<br />
Am of the fays, and live their changeless life,<br />
And, like the gods of old, I see the strife<br />
That moves the world, unmoved if so I will;<br />
For we the fruit, that teaches good and ill,<br />
Have never touched like you of Adam's race;<br />
And while thou dwellest with me in this place<br />
Thus shalt thou be&mdash;ah, and thou deem'st, indeed,<br />
That thou shalt gain thereby no happy meed<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>Reft of the world's joys? nor canst understand<br />
How thou art come into a happy land?&mdash;<br />
Love, in thy world the priests of heaven still sing,<br />
And tell thee of it many a joyous thing;<br />
But think'st thou, bearing the world's joy and pain,<br />
Thou couldst live there? nay, nay, but born again<br />
Thou wouldst be happy with the angels' bliss;<br />
And so with us no otherwise it is,<br />
Nor hast thou cast thine old life quite away<br />
Even as yet, though that shall be to-day.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But for the love and country thou hast won,</span><br />
Know thou, that thou art come to Avallon,<br />
That is both thine and mine; and as for me,<br />
Morgan le Fay men call me commonly<br />
Within the world, but fairer names than this<br />
I have for thee and me, 'twixt kiss and kiss."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, what was this? and was it all in vain,</span><br />
That she had brought him here this life to gain?<br />
For, ere her speech was done, like one turned blind<br />
He watched the kisses of the wandering wind<br />
Within her raiment, or as some one sees<br />
The very best of well-wrought images<br />
When he is blind with grief, did he behold<br />
The wandering tresses of her locks of gold<br />
Upon her shoulders; and no more he pressed<br />
The hand that in his own hand lay at rest:<br />
His eyes, grown dull with changing memories,<br />
Could make no answer to her glorious eyes:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>Cold waxed his heart, and weary and distraught,<br />
With many a cast-by, hateful, dreary thought,<br />
Unfinished in the old days; and withal<br />
He needs must think of what might chance to fall<br />
In this life new-begun; and good and bad<br />
Tormented him, because as yet he had<br />
A worldly heart within his frame made new,<br />
And to the deeds that he was wont to do<br />
Did his desires still turn. But she a while<br />
Stood gazing at him with a doubtful smile,<br />
And let his hand fall down; and suddenly<br />
Sounded sweet music from some close nearby,<br />
And then she spoke again: "Come, love, with me,<br />
That thou thy new life and delights mayst see."<br />
And gently with that word she led him thence,<br />
And though upon him now there fell a sense<br />
Of dreamy and unreal bewilderment,<br />
As hand in hand through that green place they went,<br />
Yet therewithal a strain of tender love<br />
A little yet his restless heart did move.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So through the whispering trees they came at last</span><br />
To where a wondrous house a shadow cast<br />
Across the flowers, and o'er the daisied grass<br />
Before it, crowds of lovely folk did pass,<br />
Playing about in carelessness and mirth,<br />
Unshadowed by the doubtful deeds of earth;<br />
And from the midst a band of fair girls came,<br />
With flowers and music, greeting him by name,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>And praising him; but ever like a dream<br />
He could not break, did all to Ogier seem.<br />
And he his old world did the more desire,<br />
For in his heart still burned unquenched the fire,<br />
That through the world of old so bright did burn:<br />
Yet was he fain that kindness to return,<br />
And from the depth of his full heart he sighed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then toward the house the lovely Queen did guide</span><br />
His listless steps, and seemed to take no thought<br />
Of knitted brow or wandering eyes distraught,<br />
But still with kind love lighting up her face<br />
She led him through the door of that fair place,<br />
While round about them did the damsels press;<br />
And he was moved by all that loveliness<br />
As one might be, who, lying half asleep<br />
In the May morning, notes the light wind sweep<br />
Over the tulip-beds: no more to him<br />
Were gleaming eyes, red lips, and bodies slim,<br />
Amidst that dream, although the first surprise<br />
Of hurried love wherewith the Queen's sweet eyes<br />
Had smitten him, still in his heart did stir.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so at last he came, led on by her</span><br />
Into a hall wherein a fair throne was,<br />
And hand in hand thereto the twain did pass;<br />
And there she bade him sit, and when alone<br />
He took his place upon the double throne,<br />
She cast herself before him on her knees,<br />
Embracing his, and greatly did increase<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>The shame and love that vexed his troubled heart:<br />
But now a line of girls the crowd did part,<br />
Lovelier than all, and Ogier could behold<br />
One in their midst who bore a crown of gold<br />
Within her slender hands and delicate;<br />
She, drawing nigh, beside the throne did wait<br />
Until the Queen arose and took the crown,<br />
Who then to Ogier's lips did stoop adown<br />
And kissed him, and said, "Ogier, what were worth<br />
Thy miserable days of strife on earth,<br />
That on their ashes still thine eyes are turned?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, as she spoke these words, his changed heart burned</span><br />
With sudden memories, and thereto had he<br />
Made answer, but she raised up suddenly<br />
The crown she held and set it on his head,<br />
"Ogier," she cried, "those troublous days are dead;<br />
Thou wert dead with them also, but for me;<br />
Turn unto her who wrought these things for thee!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, as he felt her touch, a mighty wave</span><br />
Of love swept o'er his soul, as though the grave<br />
Did really hold his body; from his seat<br />
He rose to cast himself before her feet;<br />
But she clung round him, and in close embrace<br />
The twain were locked amidst that thronging place.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thenceforth new life indeed has Ogier won,</span><br />
And in the happy land of Avallon<br />
Quick glide the years o'er his unchanging head;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>There saw he many men the world thought dead,<br />
Living like him in sweet forgetfulness<br />
Of all the troubles that did once oppress<br />
Their vainly-struggling lives&mdash;ah, how can I<br />
Tell of their joy as though I had been nigh?<br />
Suffice it that no fear of death they knew,<br />
That there no talk there was of false or true,<br />
Of right or wrong, for traitors came not there;<br />
That everything was bright and soft and fair,<br />
And yet they wearied not for any change,<br />
Nor unto them did constancy seem strange.<br />
Love knew they, but its pain they never had,<br />
But with each other's joy were they made glad;<br />
Nor were their lives wasted by hidden fire,<br />
Nor knew they of the unfulfilled desire<br />
That turns to ashes all the joys of earth,<br />
Nor knew they yearning love amidst the dearth<br />
Of kind and loving hearts to spend it on,<br />
Nor dreamed of discontent when all was won;<br />
Nor need they struggle after wealth and fame;<br />
Still was the calm flow of their lives the same,<br />
And yet, I say, they wearied not of it&mdash;<br />
So did the promised days by Ogier flit.</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">T</span><span class="caps">hink</span> that a hundred years have now passed by,</span><br />
Since ye beheld Ogier lie down to die<br />
Beside the fountain; think that now ye are<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>In France, made dangerous with wasting war;<br />
In Paris, where about each guarded gate,<br />
Gathered in knots, the anxious people wait,<br />
And press around each new-come man to learn<br />
If Harfleur now the pagan wasters burn,<br />
Or if the Rouen folk can keep their chain,<br />
Or Pont de l'Arche unburnt still guards the Seine?<br />
Or if 'tis true that Andelys succour wants?<br />
That Vernon's folk are fleeing east to Mantes?<br />
When will they come? or rather is it true<br />
That a great band the Constable o'erthrew<br />
Upon the marshes of the lower Seine,<br />
And that their long-ships, turning back again,<br />
Caught by the high-raised waters of the bore<br />
Were driven here and there and cast ashore?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such questions did they ask, and, as fresh men</span><br />
Came hurrying in, they asked them o'er again,<br />
And from scared folk, or fools, or ignorant,<br />
Still got new lies, or tidings very scant.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now amidst these men at last came one,</span><br />
A little ere the setting of the sun,<br />
With two stout men behind him, armed right well,<br />
Who ever as they rode on, sooth to tell,<br />
With doubtful eyes upon their master stared,<br />
Or looked about like troubled men and scared.<br />
And he they served was noteworthy indeed;<br />
Of ancient fashion were his arms and weed,<br />
Rich past the wont of men in those sad times;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>His face was bronzed, as though by burning climes,<br />
But lovely as the image of a god<br />
Carved in the days before on earth Christ trod;<br />
But solemn were his eyes, and grey as glass,<br />
And like to ruddy gold his fine hair was:<br />
A mighty man he was, and taller far<br />
Than those who on that day must bear the war<br />
The pagans waged: he by the warders stayed<br />
Scarce looked on them, but straight their words obeyed<br />
And showed his pass; then, asked about his name<br />
And from what city of the world he came,<br />
Said, that men called him now the Ancient Knight,<br />
That he was come midst the king's men to fight<br />
From St. Omer's; and as he spoke, he gazed<br />
Down on the thronging street as one amazed,<br />
And answered no more to the questioning<br />
Of frightened folk of this or that sad thing;<br />
But, ere he passed on, turned about at last<br />
And on the wondering guard a strange look cast,<br />
And said, "St. Mary! do such men as ye<br />
Fight with the wasters from across the sea?<br />
Then, certes, are ye lost, however good<br />
Your hearts may be; not such were those who stood<br />
Beside the Hammer-bearer years agone."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So said he, and as his fair armour shone</span><br />
With beauty of a time long passed away,<br />
So with the music of another day<br />
His deep voice thrilled the awe-struck, listening folk.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet from the crowd a mocking voice outbroke,</span><br />
That cried, "Be merry, masters, fear ye nought,<br />
Surely good succour to our side is brought;<br />
For here is Charlemaine come off his tomb<br />
To save his faithful city from its doom."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yea," said another, "this is certain news,</span><br />
Surely ye know how all the carvers use<br />
To carve the dead man's image at the best,<br />
That guards the place where he may lie at rest;<br />
Wherefore this living image looks indeed,<br />
Spite of his ancient tongue and marvellous weed,<br />
To have but thirty summers."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">At the name</span><br />
Of Charlemaine, he turned to whence there came<br />
The mocking voice, and somewhat knit his brow,<br />
And seemed as he would speak, but scarce knew how;<br />
So with a half-sigh soon sank back again<br />
Into his dream, and shook his well-wrought rein,<br />
And silently went on upon his way.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And this was Ogier: on what evil day</span><br />
Has he then stumbled, that he needs must come,<br />
Midst war and ravage, to the ancient home<br />
Of his desires? did he grow weary then,<br />
And wish to strive once more with foolish men<br />
For worthless things? or is fair Avallon<br />
Sunk in the sea, and all that glory gone?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nay, thus it happed&mdash;One day she came to him</span><br />
And said, "Ogier, thy name is waxing dim<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>Upon the world that thou rememberest not;<br />
The heathen men are thick on many a spot<br />
Thine eyes have seen, and which I love therefore;<br />
And God will give His wonted help no more.<br />
Wilt thou, then, help? canst thou have any mind<br />
To give thy banner once more to the wind?<br />
Since greater glory thou shalt win for this<br />
Than erst thou gatheredst ere thou cam'st to bliss:<br />
For men are dwindled both in heart and frame,<br />
Nor holds the fair land any such a name<br />
As thine, when thou wert living midst thy peers;<br />
The world is worser for these hundred years."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From his calm eyes there gleamed a little fire,</span><br />
And in his voice was something of desire,<br />
To see the land where he was used to be,<br />
As now he answered: "Nay, choose thou for me,<br />
Thou art the wisest; it is more than well<br />
Within this peaceful place with thee to dwell:<br />
Nor ill perchance in that old land to die,<br />
If, dying, I keep not the memory<br />
Of this fair life of ours." "Nay, nay," said she,<br />
"As to thy dying, that shall never be,<br />
Whiles that thou keep'st my ring&mdash;and now, behold,<br />
I take from thee thy charmed crown of gold,<br />
And thou wilt be the Ogier that thou wast<br />
Ere on the loadstone rock thy ship was cast:<br />
Yet thou shalt have thy youthful body still,<br />
And I will guard thy life from every ill."<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">So was it done, and Ogier, armed right well,</span><br />
Sleeping, was borne away by some strong spell,<br />
And set upon the Flemish coast; and thence<br />
Turned to St. Omer's, with a doubtful sense<br />
Of being in some wild dream, the while he knew<br />
That great delight forgotten was his due,<br />
That all which there might hap was of small worth.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So on he went, and sometimes unto mirth</span><br />
Did his attire move the country-folk,<br />
But oftener when strange speeches from him broke<br />
Concerning men and things for long years dead,<br />
He filled the listeners with great awe and dread;<br />
For in such wild times as these people were<br />
Are men soon moved to wonder and to fear.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now through the streets of Paris did he ride,</span><br />
And at a certain hostel did abide<br />
Throughout that night, and ere he went next day<br />
He saw a book that on a table lay,<br />
And opening it 'gan read in lazy mood:<br />
But long before it in that place he stood,<br />
Noting nought else; for it did chronicle<br />
The deeds of men whom once he knew right well,<br />
When they were living in the flesh with him:<br />
Yea, his own deeds he saw, grown strange and dim<br />
Already, and true stories mixed with lies,<br />
Until, with many thronging memories<br />
Of those old days, his heart was so oppressed,<br />
He 'gan to wish that he might lie at rest,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>Forgetting all things: for indeed by this<br />
Little remembrance had he of the bliss<br />
That wrapped his soul in peaceful Avallon.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But his changed life he needs must carry on;</span><br />
For ye shall know the Queen was gathering men<br />
To send unto the good King, who as then<br />
In Rouen lay, beset by many a band<br />
Of those who carried terror through the land,<br />
And still by messengers for help he prayed:<br />
Therefore a mighty muster was being made,<br />
Of weak and strong, and brave and timorous,<br />
Before the Queen anigh her royal house.<br />
So thither on this morn did Ogier turn,<br />
Some certain news about the war to learn;<br />
And when he came at last into the square,<br />
And saw the ancient palace great and fair<br />
Rise up before him as in other days,<br />
And in the merry morn the bright sun's rays<br />
Glittering on gathered helms and moving spears,<br />
He 'gan to feel as in the long-past years,<br />
And his heart stirred within him. Now the Queen<br />
Came from within, right royally beseen,<br />
And took her seat beneath a canopy,<br />
With lords and captains of the war anigh;<br />
And as she came a mighty shout arose,<br />
And round about began the knights to close,<br />
Their oath of fealty to swear anew,<br />
And learn what service they had got to do.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>But so it was, that some their shouts must stay<br />
To gaze at Ogier as he took his way<br />
Through the thronged place; and quickly too he gat<br />
Unto the place whereas the Lady sat,<br />
For men gave place unto him, fearing him:<br />
For not alone was he most huge of limb,<br />
And dangerous, but something in his face,<br />
As his calm eyes looked o'er the crowded place,<br />
Struck men with awe; and in the ancient days,<br />
When men might hope alive on gods to gaze,<br />
They would have thought, "The gods yet love our town<br />
And from the heavens have sent a great one down."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Withal unto the throne he came so near,</span><br />
That he the Queen's sweet measured voice could hear;<br />
And swiftly now within him wrought the change<br />
That first he felt amid those faces strange;<br />
And his heart burned to taste the hurrying life<br />
With such desires, such changing sweetness rife.<br />
And yet, indeed, how should he live alone,<br />
Who in the old past days such friends had known?<br />
Then he began to think of Caraheu,<br />
Of Bellicent the fair, and once more knew<br />
The bitter pain of rent and ended love.<br />
But while with hope and vain regret he strove,<br />
He found none 'twixt him and the Queen's high seat,<br />
And, stepping forth, he knelt before her feet<br />
And took her hand to swear, as was the way<br />
Of doing fealty in that ancient day,<br />
And raised his eyes to hers; as fair was she<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>As any woman of the world might be<br />
Full-limbed and tall, dark-haired, from her deep eyes,<br />
The snare of fools, the ruin of the wise,<br />
Love looked unchecked; and now her dainty hand,<br />
The well-knit holder of the golden wand,<br />
Trembled in his, she cast her eyes adown,<br />
And her sweet brow was knitted to a frown,<br />
As he, the taker of such oaths of yore,<br />
Now unto her all due obedience swore,<br />
Yet gave himself no name; and now the Queen,<br />
Awed by his voice as other folk had been,<br />
Yet felt a trembling hope within her rise<br />
Too sweet to think of, and with love's surprise<br />
Her cheek grew pale; she said, "Thy style and name<br />
Thou tellest not, nor what land of thy fame<br />
Is glad; for, certes, some land must be glad,<br />
That in its bounds her house thy mother had."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Lady," he said, "from what far land I come</span><br />
I well might tell thee, but another home<br />
Have I long dwelt in, and its name have I<br />
Forgotten now, forgotten utterly<br />
Who were my fellows, and what deeds they did;<br />
Therefore, indeed, shall my first name be hid<br />
And my first country; call me on this day<br />
The Ancient Knight, and let me go my way."<br />
He rose withal, for she her fingers fair<br />
Had drawn aback, and on him 'gan to stare<br />
As one afeard; for something terrible<br />
Was in his speech, and that she knew right well,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>Who 'gan to love him, and to fear that she,<br />
Shut out by some strange deadly mystery,<br />
Should never gain from him an equal love;<br />
Yet, as from her high seat he 'gan to move,<br />
She said, "O Ancient Knight, come presently,<br />
When we have done this muster, unto me,<br />
And thou shalt have thy charge and due command<br />
For freeing from our foes this wretched land!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Ogier made his reverence and went,</span><br />
And somewhat could perceive of her intent;<br />
For in his heart life grew, and love with life<br />
Grew, and therewith, 'twixt love and fame, was strife.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, as he slowly gat him from the square,</span><br />
Gazing at all the people gathered there,<br />
A squire of the Queen's behind him came,<br />
And breathless, called him by his new-coined name,<br />
And bade him turn because the Queen now bade,<br />
Since by the muster long she might be stayed,<br />
That to the palace he should bring him straight,<br />
Midst sport and play her coming back to wait;<br />
Then Ogier turned, nought loath, and with him went,<br />
And to a postern-gate his steps he bent,<br />
That Ogier knew right well in days of old;<br />
Worn was it now, and the bright hues and gold<br />
Upon the shields above, with lapse of days,<br />
Were faded much: but now did Ogier gaze<br />
Upon the garden where he walked of yore,<br />
Holding the hands that he should see no more;<br />
For all was changed except the palace fair,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>That Charlemaine's own eyes had seen built there<br />
Ere Ogier knew him; there the squire did lead<br />
The Ancient Knight, who still took little heed<br />
Of all the things that by the way he said,<br />
For all his thoughts were on the days long dead.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There in the painted hall he sat again,</span><br />
And 'neath the pictured eyes of Charlemaine<br />
He ate and drank, and felt it like a dream;<br />
And midst his growing longings yet might deem<br />
That he from sleep should wake up presently<br />
In some fair city on the Syrian sea,<br />
Or on the brown rocks of the loadstone isle.<br />
But fain to be alone, within a while<br />
He gat him to the garden, and there passed<br />
By wondering squires and damsels, till at last,<br />
Far from the merry folk who needs must play,<br />
If on the world were coming its last day,<br />
He sat him down, and through his mind there ran<br />
Faint thoughts of that day, when, outworn and wan,<br />
He lay down by the fountain-side to die.<br />
But when he strove to gain clear memory<br />
Of what had happed since on the isle he lay<br />
Waiting for death, a hopeless castaway,<br />
Thought, failing him, would rather bring again<br />
His life among the peers of Charlemaine,<br />
And vex his soul with hapless memories;<br />
Until at last, worn out by thought of these,<br />
And hopeless striving to find what was true,<br />
And pondering on the deeds he had to do<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>Ere he returned, whereto he could not tell,<br />
Sweet sleep upon his wearied spirit fell.<br />
And on the afternoon of that fair day,<br />
Forgetting all, beneath the trees he lay.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Meanwhile the Queen, affairs of state being done,</span><br />
Went through the gardens with one dame alone<br />
Seeking for Ogier, whom at last she found<br />
Laid sleeping on the daisy-sprinkled ground.<br />
Dreaming, I know not what, of other days.<br />
Then on him for a while the Queen did gaze,<br />
Drawing sweet poison from the lovely sight,<br />
Then to her fellow turned, "The Ancient Knight&mdash;<br />
What means he by this word of his?" she said;<br />
"He were well mated with some lovely maid<br />
Just pondering on the late-heard name of love."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Softly, my lady, he begins to move,"</span><br />
Her fellow said, a woman old and grey;<br />
"Look now, his arms are of another day;<br />
None know him or his deeds; thy squire just said<br />
He asked about the state of men long dead;<br />
I fear what he may be; look, seest thou not<br />
That ring that on one finger he has got,<br />
Where figures strange upon the gold are wrought:<br />
God grant that he from hell has not been brought<br />
For our confusion, in this doleful war,<br />
Who surely in enough of trouble are<br />
Without such help;" then the Queen turned aside<br />
Awhile, her drawn and troubled face to hide,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>For lurking dread this speech within her stirred;<br />
But yet she said, "Thou sayest a foolish word,<br />
This man is come against our enemies<br />
To fight for us." Then down upon her knees<br />
Fell the old woman by the sleeping knight,<br />
And from his hand she drew with fingers light<br />
The wondrous ring, and scarce again could rise<br />
Ere 'neath the trembling Queen's bewildered eyes<br />
The change began; his golden hair turned white,<br />
His smooth cheek wrinkled, and his breathing light<br />
Was turned to troublous struggling for his breath,<br />
And on his shrunk lips lay the hand of death;<br />
And, scarce less pale than he, the trembling Queen<br />
Stood thinking on the beauty she had seen<br />
And longed for, but a little while ago,<br />
Yet with her terror still her love did grow,<br />
And she began to weep as though she saw<br />
Her beauty e'en to such an ending draw.<br />
And 'neath her tears waking he oped his eyes,<br />
And strove to speak, but nought but gasping sighs<br />
His lips could utter; then he tried to reach<br />
His hand to them, as though he would beseech<br />
The gift of what was his: but all the while<br />
The crone gazed on them with an evil smile,<br />
Then holding toward the Queen that wondrous ring,<br />
She said, "Why weep'st thou? having this fair thing,<br />
Thou, losing nought the beauty that thou hast,<br />
May'st watch the vainly struggling world go past,<br />
Thyself unchanged." The Queen put forth her hand<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>And took the ring, and there awhile did stand<br />
And strove to think of it, but still in her<br />
Such all-absorbing longings love did stir,<br />
So young she was, of death she could not think,<br />
Or what a cup eld gives to man to drink;<br />
Yet on her finger had she set the ring<br />
When now the life that hitherto did cling<br />
To Ogier's heart seemed fading quite away,<br />
And scarcely breathing with shut eyes he lay.<br />
Then, kneeling down, she murmured piteously,<br />
"Ah, wilt thou love me if I give it thee,<br />
And thou grow'st young again? what should I do<br />
If with the eyes thou thus shalt gain anew<br />
Thou shouldst look scorn on me?" But with that word<br />
The hedge behind her, by the west wind stirred,<br />
Cast fear into her heart of some one nigh,<br />
And therewith on his finger hastily<br />
She set the ring, then rose and stood apart<br />
A little way, and in her doubtful heart<br />
With love and fear was mixed desire of life.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But standing so, a look with great scorn rife</span><br />
The elder woman, turning, cast on her,<br />
Pointing to Ogier, who began to stir;<br />
She looked, and all she erst saw now did seem<br />
To have been nothing but a hideous dream,<br />
As fair and young he rose from off the ground<br />
And cast a dazed and puzzled look around,<br />
Like one just waked from sleep in some strange place;<br />
But soon his grave eyes rested on her face,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>And turned yet graver seeing her so pale,<br />
And that her eyes were pregnant with some tale<br />
Of love and fear; she 'neath his eyes the while<br />
Forced her pale lips to semblance of a smile,<br />
And said, "O Ancient Knight, thou sleepest then?<br />
While through this poor land range the heathen men<br />
Unmet of any but my King and Lord:<br />
Nay, let us see the deeds of thine old sword."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Queen," said he, "bid me then unto this work,</span><br />
And certes I behind no wall would lurk,<br />
Nor send for succour, while a scanty folk<br />
Still followed after me to break the yoke:<br />
I pray thee grace for sleeping, and were fain<br />
That I might rather never sleep again<br />
Then have such wretched dreams as I e'en now<br />
Have waked from."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">Lovelier she seemed to grow</span><br />
Unto him as he spoke; fresh colour came<br />
Into her face, as though for some sweet shame,<br />
While she with tearful eyes beheld him so,<br />
That somewhat even must his burnt cheek glow,<br />
His heart beat faster. But again she said,<br />
"Nay, will dreams burden such a mighty head?<br />
Then may I too have pardon for a dream:<br />
Last night in sleep I saw thee, who didst seem<br />
To be the King of France; and thou and I<br />
Were sitting at some great festivity<br />
Within the many-peopled gold-hung place."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The blush of shame was gone as on his face</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>She gazed, and saw him read her meaning clear<br />
And knew that no cold words she had to fear,<br />
But rather that for softer speech he yearned.<br />
Therefore, with love alone her smooth cheek burned;<br />
Her parted lips were hungry for his kiss,<br />
She trembled at the near approaching bliss;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nathless, she checked her love a little while,</span><br />
Because she felt the old dame's curious smile<br />
Upon her, and she said, "O Ancient Knight,<br />
If I then read my last night's dream aright,<br />
Thou art come here our very help to be,<br />
Perchance to give my husband back to me;<br />
Come then, if thou this land art fain to save,<br />
And show the wisdom thou must surely have<br />
Unto my council; I will give thee then<br />
What charge I may among my valiant men;<br />
And certes thou wilt do so well herein,<br />
That, ere long, something greater shalt thou win:<br />
Come, then, deliverer of my throne and land,<br />
And let me touch for once thy mighty hand<br />
With these weak fingers."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">As she spoke, she met</span><br />
His eager hand, and all things did forget<br />
But for one moment, for too wise were they<br />
To cast the coming years of joy away;<br />
Then with her other hand her gown she raised<br />
And led him thence, and o'er her shoulder gazed<br />
At her old follower with a doubtful smile,<br />
As though to say, "Be wise, I know thy guile!"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But slowly she behind the lovers walked,</span><br />
Muttering, "So be it! thou shalt not be balked<br />
Of thy desire; be merry! I am wise,<br />
Nor will I rob thee of thy Paradise<br />
For any other than myself; and thou<br />
May'st even happen to have had enow<br />
Of this new love, before I get the ring,<br />
And I may work for thee no evil thing."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now ye shall know that the old chronicle,</span><br />
Wherein I read all this, doth duly tell<br />
Of all the gallant deeds that Ogier did,<br />
There may ye read them; nor let me be chid<br />
If I therefore say little of these things,<br />
Because the thought of Avallon still clings<br />
Unto my heart, and scarcely can I bear<br />
To think of that long, dragging, useless year,<br />
Through which, with dulled and glimmering memory,<br />
Ogier was grown content to live and die<br />
Like other men; but this I have to say,<br />
That in the council chamber on that day<br />
The Old Knight showed his wisdom well enow,<br />
While fainter still with love the Queen did grow<br />
Hearing his words, beholding his grey eyes<br />
Flashing with fire of warlike memories;<br />
Yea, at the last he seemed so wise indeed<br />
That she could give him now the charge, to lead<br />
One wing of the great army that set out<br />
From Paris' gates, midst many a wavering shout,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>Midst trembling prayers, and unchecked wails and tears,<br />
And slender hopes and unresisted fears.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now ere he went, upon his bed he lay,</span><br />
Newly awakened at the dawn of day,<br />
Gathering perplex&eacute;d thoughts of many a thing,<br />
When, midst the carol that the birds did sing<br />
Unto the coming of the hopeful sun,<br />
He heard a sudden lovesome song begun<br />
'Twixt two young voices in the garden green,<br />
That seemed indeed the farewell of the Queen.</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<p>Soothed by the pleasure that the music brought<br />
And sweet desire, and vague and dreamy thought<br />
Of happiness it seemed to promise him,<br />
He lay and listened till his eyes grew dim,<br />
And o'er him 'gan forgetfulness to creep<br />
Till in the growing light he lay asleep,<br />
Nor woke until the clanging trumpet-blast<br />
Had summoned him all thought away to cast:<br />
Yet one more joy of love indeed he had<br />
Ere with the battle's noise he was made glad;<br />
For, as on that May morning forth they rode<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>And passed before the Queen's most fair abode,<br />
There at a window was she waiting them<br />
In fair attire with gold in every hem,<br />
And as the Ancient Knight beneath her passed<br />
A wreath of flowering white-thorn down she cast,<br />
And looked farewell to him, and forth he set<br />
Thinking of all the pleasure he should get<br />
From love and war, forgetting Avallon<br />
And all that lovely life so lightly won;<br />
Yea, now indeed the earthly life o'erpast<br />
Ere on the loadstone rock his ship was cast<br />
Was waxing dim, nor yet at all he learned<br />
To 'scape the fire that erst his heart had burned.<br />
And he forgat his deeds, forgat his fame,<br />
Forgat the letters of his ancient name<br />
As one waked fully shall forget a dream,<br />
That once to him a wondrous tale did seem.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now I, though writing here no chronicle</span><br />
E'en as I said, must nathless shortly tell<br />
That, ere the army Rouen's gates could gain<br />
By a broad arrow had the King been slain,<br />
And helpless now the wretched country lay<br />
Beneath the yoke, until the glorious day<br />
When Ogier fell at last upon the foe,<br />
And scattered them as helplessly as though<br />
They had been beaten men without a name:<br />
So when to Paris town once more he came<br />
Few folk the memory of the King did keep<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>Within their hearts, and if the folk did weep<br />
At his returning, 'twas for joy indeed<br />
That such a man had risen at their need<br />
To work for them so great deliverance,<br />
And loud they called on him for King of France.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But if the Queen's heart were the more a-flame</span><br />
For all that she had heard of his great fame,<br />
I know not; rather with some hidden dread<br />
Of coming fate, she heard her lord was dead,<br />
And her false dream seemed coming true at last,<br />
For the clear sky of love seemed overcast<br />
With clouds of God's great judgments, and the fear<br />
Of hate and final parting drawing near.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So now when he before her throne did stand</span><br />
Amidst the throng as saviour of the land,<br />
And she her eyes to his kind eyes did raise,<br />
And there before all her own love must praise;<br />
Then did she fall a-weeping, and folk said,<br />
"See, how she sorrows for the newly dead!<br />
Amidst our joy she needs must think of him;<br />
Let be, full surely shall her grief wax dim<br />
And she shall wed again."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">So passed the year,</span><br />
While Ogier set himself the land to clear<br />
Of broken remnants of the heathen men,<br />
And at the last, when May-time came again,<br />
Must he be crowned King of the twice-saved land,<br />
And at the altar take the fair Queen's hand<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>And wed her for his own. And now by this<br />
Had he forgotten clean the woe and bliss<br />
Of his old life, and still was he made glad<br />
As other men; and hopes and fears he had<br />
As others, and bethought him not at all<br />
Of what strange days upon him yet should fall<br />
When he should live and these again be dead.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now drew the time round when he should be wed,</span><br />
And in his palace on his bed he lay<br />
Upon the dawning of the very day:<br />
'Twixt sleep and waking was he, and could hear<br />
E'en at that hour, through the bright morn and clear,<br />
The hammering of the folk who toiled to make<br />
Some well-wrought stages for the pageant's sake,<br />
Though hardly yet the sparrows had begun<br />
To twitter o'er the coming of the sun,<br />
Nor through the palace did a creature move.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There in the sweet entanglement of love</span><br />
Midst languid thoughts of greater bliss he lay,<br />
Remembering no more of that other day<br />
Than the hot noon remembereth of the night,<br />
Than summer thinketh of the winter white.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that sweet hour he heard a voice that cried,</span><br />
"Ogier, Ogier!" then, opening his eyes wide,<br />
And rising on his elbow, gazed around,<br />
And strange to him and empty was the sound<br />
Of his own name; "Whom callest thou?" he said<br />
"For I, the man who lie upon this bed,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>Am Charles of France, and shall be King to-day,<br />
But in a year that now is passed away<br />
The Ancient Knight they called me: who is this,<br />
Thou callest Ogier, then, what deeds are his?<br />
And who art thou?" But at that word a sigh,<br />
As of one grieved, came from some place anigh<br />
His bed-side, and a soft voice spake again,<br />
"This Ogier once was great amongst great men;<br />
To Italy a helpless hostage led;<br />
He saved the King when the false Lombard fled,<br />
Bore forth the Oriflamme and gained the day;<br />
Charlot he brought back, whom men led away,<br />
And fought a day-long fight with Caraheu.<br />
The ravager of Rome his right hand slew;<br />
Nor did he fear the might of Charlemaine,<br />
Who for a dreary year beset in vain<br />
His lonely castle; yet at last caught then,<br />
And shut in hold, needs must he come again<br />
To give an unhoped great deliverance<br />
Unto the burdened helpless land of France:<br />
Denmark he gained thereafter, and he wore<br />
The crown of England drawn from trouble sore;<br />
At Tyre then he reigned, and Babylon<br />
With mighty deeds he from the foemen won;<br />
And when scarce aught could give him greater fame,<br />
He left the world still thinking on his name.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"These things did Ogier, and these things didst thou,</span><br />
Nor will I call thee by a new name now<br />
Since I have spoken words of love to thee&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>Ogier, Ogier, dost thou remember me,<br />
E'en if thou hast no thought of that past time<br />
Before thou camest to our happy clime?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As this was said, his mazed eyes saw indeed</span><br />
A lovely woman clad in dainty weed<br />
Beside his bed, and many a thought was stirred<br />
Within his heart by that last plaintive word,<br />
Though nought he said, but waited what should come<br />
"Love," said she, "I am here to bring thee home;<br />
Well hast thou done all that thou cam'st to do,<br />
And if thou bidest here, for something new<br />
Will folk begin to cry, and all thy fame<br />
Shall then avail thee but for greater blame;<br />
Thy love shall cease to love thee, and the earth<br />
Thou lovest now shall be of little worth<br />
While still thou keepest life, abhorring it<br />
Behold, in men's lives that so quickly flit<br />
Thus is it, how then shall it be with thee,<br />
Who some faint image of eternity<br />
Hast gained through me?&mdash;alas, thou heedest not!<br />
On all these changing things thine heart is hot&mdash;<br />
Take then this gift that I have brought from far,<br />
And then may'st thou remember what we are;<br />
The lover and the loved from long ago."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He trembled, and more memory seemed to grow</span><br />
Within his heart as he beheld her stand,<br />
Holding a glittering crown in her right hand:<br />
"Ogier," she said, "arise and do on thee<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>The emblems of thy worldly sovereignty,<br />
For we must pass o'er many a sea this morn."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He rose, and in the glittering tunic worn</span><br />
By Charlemaine he clad himself, and took<br />
The ivory hand, that Charlemaine once shook<br />
Over the people's heads in days of old;<br />
Then on his feet he set the shoes of gold.<br />
And o'er his shoulders threw the mantle fair,<br />
And set the gold crown on his golden hair:<br />
Then on the royal chair he sat him down,<br />
As though he deemed the elders of the town<br />
Should come to audience; and in all he seemed<br />
To do these things e'en as a man who dreamed.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now adown the Seine the golden sun</span><br />
Shone out, as toward him drew that lovely one<br />
And took from off his head the royal crown,<br />
And, smiling, on the pillow laid it down<br />
And said, "Lie there, O crown of Charlemaine,<br />
Worn by a mighty man, and worn in vain,<br />
Because he died, and all the things he did<br />
Were changed before his face by earth was hid;<br />
A better crown I have for my love's head,<br />
Whereby he yet shall live, when all are dead<br />
His hand has helped." Then on his head she set<br />
The wondrous crown, and said, "Forget, forget!<br />
Forget these weary things, for thou hast much<br />
Of happiness to think of."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">At that touch</span><br />
He rose, a happy light gleamed in his eyes;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>And smitten by the rush of memories,<br />
He stammered out, "O love! how came we here?<br />
What do we in this land of Death and Fear?<br />
Have I not been from thee a weary while?<br />
Let us return&mdash;I dreamed about the isle;<br />
I dreamed of other years of strife and pain,<br />
Of new years full of struggles long and vain."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She took him by the hand and said, "Come, love,</span><br />
I am not changed;" and therewith did they move<br />
Unto the door, and through the sleeping place<br />
Swiftly they went, and still was Ogier's face<br />
Turned on her beauty, and no thought was his<br />
Except the dear returning of his bliss.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But at the threshold of the palace-gate</span><br />
That opened to them, she awhile did wait,<br />
And turned her eyes unto the rippling Seine<br />
And said, "O love, behold it once again!"<br />
He turned, and gazed upon the city grey<br />
Smit by the gold of that sweet morn of May;<br />
He heard faint noises as of wakening folk<br />
As on their heads his day of glory broke;<br />
He heard the changing rush of the swift stream<br />
Against the bridge-piers. All was grown a dream<br />
His work was over, his reward was come,<br />
Why should he loiter longer from his home?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A little while she watched him silently,</span><br />
Then beckoned him to follow with a sigh,<br />
And, raising up the raiment from her feet,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>Across the threshold stepped into the street;<br />
One moment on the twain the low sun shone,<br />
And then the place was void, and they were gone<br />
How I know not; but this I know indeed,<br />
That in whatso great trouble or sore need<br />
The land of France since that fair day has been,<br />
No more the sword of Ogier has she seen.</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="big">S</span><span class="caps">uch</span> was the tale he told of Avallon.</span><br />
E'en such an one as in days past had won<br />
His youthful heart to think upon the quest;<br />
But to those old hearts nigh in reach of rest,<br />
Not much to be desired now it seemed&mdash;<br />
Perchance the heart that of such things had dreamed<br />
Had found no words in this death-laden tongue<br />
We speak on earth, wherewith they might be sung;<br />
Perchance the changing years that changed his heart<br />
E'en in the words of that old tale had part,<br />
Changing its sweet to bitter, to despair<br />
The foolish hope that once had glittered there&mdash;<br />
Or think, that in some bay of that far home<br />
They then had sat, and watched the green waves come<br />
Up to their feet with many promises;<br />
Or the light wind midst blossom-laden trees,<br />
In the sweet Spring had weighted many a word<br />
Of no worth now, and many a hope had stirred<br />
Long dead for ever.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Howsoe'er that be</span><br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
