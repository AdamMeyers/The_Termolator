FLEURY, CLAUDE (1640-1723), French ecclesiastical historian,
was born at Paris on the 6th of December 1640. Destined for
the bar, he was educated at the aristocratic college of Clermont
(now that of Louis-le-Grand). In 1658 he was nominated an
advocate to the parlement of Paris, and for nine years followed
the legal profession. But he had long been of a religious disposition,
and in 1667 turned from law to theology. He had been
some time in orders when Louis XIV., in 1672, selected him as
tutor of the princes of Conti, with such success that the king
next entrusted to him the education of the count of Vermandois,
one of his natural sons, on whose death in 1683 Fleury received
for his services the Cistercian abbey of Loc-Dieu, in the diocese
of Rhodez. In 1689 he was appointed sub-preceptor of the dukes
of Burgundy, of Anjou, and of Berry, and thus became intimately
associated with FÃ©nelon, their chief tutor. In 1696 he was
elected to fill the place of La BruyÃ¨re in the French Academy;
and on the completion of the education of the young princes
the king bestowed upon him the rich priory of Argenteuil, in the
diocese of Paris (1706). On assuming this benefice he resigned,
with rare disinterestedness, that of the abbey of Loc-Dieu.
About this time he began his great work, the first of the kind in
France, and one for which he had been collecting materials
for thirty years&mdash;the Histoire ecclÃ©siastique. Fleury&rsquo;s evident
intention was to write a history of the church for all classes of
society; but at the time in which his great work appeared it
was less religion than theology that absorbed the attention of
the clergy and the educated public; and his work accordingly
appealed to the student rather than to the popular reader,
dwelling as it does very particularly on questions of doctrine,
of discipline, of supremacy, and of rivalry between the priesthood
and the imperial power. Nevertheless it had a great success.
The first edition, printed at Paris in 20 volumes 4to, 1691, was
followed by many others, among which may be mentioned that
of Brussels, in 32 vols. 8vo, 1692, and that of Nismes, in 25 vols.
8vo, 1778 to 1780. The work of Fleury only comes down to the
year 1414. It was continued by J. Claude Fabre and Goujet
down to 1595, in 16 vols. 4to. In consulting the work of Fleury
and its supplement, the general table of contents, published
by Rondel, Paris, 1758, 1 vol. 4to, will be found very useful.
Translations have been made of the entire work into Latin,
German and Italian. The Latin translation, published at
Augsburg, 1758-1759, 85 vols. 8vo, carries the work down to
1684. Fleury, who had been appointed confessor to the young
king Louis XV. in 1716, because, as the duke of Orleans said,
he was neither Jansenist nor Molinist, nor Ultramontanist, but
Catholic, died on the 14th of July 1723. His great learning was
equalled by the modest simplicity of his life and the uprightness
of his conduct.


Fleury left many works besides his Histoire ecclÃ©siastique. The
following deserve special mention:&mdash;Histoire du droit franÃ§ois (1674,
12mo); M&oelig;urs des IsraÃ©lites (1681, 12mo); M&oelig;urs des ChrÃ©tiens
(1682, 12mo); TraitÃ© du choix et de la mÃ©thode des Ã©tudes (1686,
2 vols. 12mo); Les Devoirs des maÃ®tres et des domestiques (1688,
12mo). A number of the smaller works were published in one volume
at Paris in 1807. The Roman Congregation of the Index condemned
his CatÃ©chisme historique (1679) and the Institution du droit ecclÃ©siastique
(1687).

FLIEDNER, THEODOR (1800-1864), German Protestant
divine, was born on the 21st of January 1800 at Epstein (near
Wiesbaden), the small village in which his father was pastor.
He studied theology at the universities of Giessen and GÃ¶ttingen,
and at the theological seminary of Herborn, and at the age of
twenty he passed his final examination. After a year spent
in teaching and preaching, in 1821 he accepted a call from the
Protestant church at Kaiserswerth, a little town on the Rhine,
a few miles below DÃ¼sseldorf. To help his people and to provide
an endowment for his church, he undertook journeys in 1822
through part of Germany, and then in 1823 to Holland and
England. He met with considerable success, and had opportunities
of observing what was being done towards prison reform;
in England he made the acquaintance of the philanthropist
Elizabeth Fry. The German prisons were then in a very bad
state. The prisoners were huddled together in dirty rooms,
badly fed, and left in complete idleness. No one dreamed of
instructing them, or of collecting statistics to form the basis
of useful legislation on the subject. Fliedner, at first singly,
undertook the work. He applied for permission to be imprisoned
for some time, in order that he might look at prison life from the
inside. This petition was refused, but he was allowed to hold
fortnightly services in the DÃ¼sseldorf prison, and to visit the
inmates individually. Those interested in the subject banded
themselves together, and on the 18th of June 1826 the first
Prison Society of Germany (Rheinisch-WestfÃ¤lischer GefÃ¤ngnisverein)
was founded. In 1833 Fliedner opened in his own
parsonage garden at Kaiserswerth a refuge for discharged
female convicts. His circle of practical philanthropy rapidly
increased. The state of the sick poor had for some time excited
his interest, and it seemed to him that hospitals might be
best served by an organized body of specially trained women.
Accordingly in 1836 he began the first deaconess house, and
the hospital at Kaiserswerth. By their ordination vows the
deaconesses devoted themselves to the care of the poor, the sick
and the young; but their engagements were not final&mdash;they
might leave their work and return to ordinary life if they chose.
In addition to these institutions Fliedner founded in 1835 an
infant school, then a normal school for infant school mistresses
(1836), an orphanage for orphan girls of the middle class (1842),
and an asylum for female lunatics (1847). Moreover, he assisted
at the foundation and in the management of similar institutions,
not only in Germany, but in various parts of Europe.

In 1849 he resigned his pastoral charge, and from 1849 to 1851
he travelled over a large part of Europe, America and the East&mdash;the
object of his journeys being to found &ldquo;mother houses,&rdquo;
which were to be not merely training schools for deaconesses, but
also centres whence other training establishments might arise.
He established a deaconess house in Jerusalem, and after his
return assisted by counsel and money in the erection of establishments
at Constantinople, Smyrna, Alexandria and Bucharest.
Among his later efforts may be mentioned the Christian house of
refuge for female servants in Berlin (connected with which other
institutions soon arose) and the &ldquo;house of evening rest&rdquo; for
retired deaconesses at Kaiserswerth. In 1855 Fliedner received
the degree of doctor in theology from the university of Bonn, in
recognition rather of his practical activity than of his theological
attainments. He died on the 4th of October 1864, leaving behind
him over 100 stations attended by 430 deaconesses; and these
by 1876 had increased to 150 with an attendance of 600.

Fliedner&rsquo;s son Fritz Fliedner (1845-1901), after studying
in Halle and TÃ¼bingen, became in 1870 chaplain to the embassy in
502
Madrid. He followed in his father&rsquo;s footsteps by founding
several philanthropic institutions in Spain. He was also the
author of a number of books, amongst which was an autobiography,
Aus meinem Leben. Erinnerungen und Erfahrungen
(1901).


Theodor Fliedner&rsquo;s writings are almost entirely of a practical
character. He edited a periodical, Der Armen und Kranken Freund,
which contained information regarding the various institutions, and
also the yearly almanac of the Kaiserswerth institution. Besides purely
educational and devotional works, he wrote Buch der MÃ¤rtyrer (1852);
Kurze Geschichte der Entstehung der ersten evang. Liebesanstalten zu
Kaiserswerth (1856); Nachricht Ã¼ber das Diakonissen-Werk in der
Christ. Kirche (5th ed., 1867); Die evangel. MÃ¤rtyrer Ungarns und
SiebenbÃ¼rgens; and Beschreibung der Reise nach Jerusalem und
Constantinopel. All were published at Kaiserswerth. There is a
translation of the German life by C. Winkworth (London, 1867).

und Wirkens (3rd ed., 1892). See also on Fliedner and his work

Stephen (London, 1871); W.F. Stevenson&rsquo;s Praying and Working
(London, 1865).




FLIGHT and FLYING. Of the many scientific problems of
modern times, there are few possessing a wider or more enduring
interest than that of aerial navigation (see also Aeronautics).
To fly has always been an object of ambition with man; nor
will this occasion surprise when we remember the marvellous
freedom enjoyed by volant as compared with non-volant animals.
The subject of aviation is admittedly one of extreme difficulty.
To tread upon the air (and this is what is really meant) is, at
first sight, in the highest degree utopian; and yet there are
thousands of living creatures which actually accomplish this
feat. These creatures, however varied in form and structure,
all fly according to one and the same principle; and this is a
significant fact, as it tends to show that the air must be attacked
in a particular way to ensure flight. It behoves us then at the
outset to scrutinize very carefully the general configuration of
flying animals, and in particular the size, shape and movements
of their flying organs.

Flying animals differ entirely from sailing ships and from
balloons, with which they are not unfrequently though erroneously
compared; and a flying machine constructed upon proper
principles can have nothing in common with either of those
creations. The ship floats upon water and the balloon upon air;
but the ship differs from the balloon, and the ship and the balloon
differ from the flying creature and flying machine. The water
and air, moreover, have characteristics of their own. The
analogies which connect the water with the air, the ship with the
balloon, and the ship and the balloon with the flying creature
and flying machine are false analogies. A sailing ship is supported
by the water and requires merely to be propelled; a
flying creature and a flying machine constructed on the living
type require to be both supported and propelled. This arises
from the fact that water is much denser than air, and because
water supports on its surface substances which fall through air.
While water and air are both fluid media, they are to be distinguished
from each other in the following particulars. Water
is comparatively very heavy, inelastic and incompressible;
air, on the other hand, is comparatively very light, elastic and
compressible. If water be struck with violence, the recoil
obtained is great when compared with the recoil obtained from
air similarly treated. In water we get a maximum recoil with a
minimum of displacement; in air, on the contrary, we obtain a
minimum recoil with a maximum of displacement. Water and
air when unconfined yield readily to pressure. They thus form
movable fulcra to bodies acting upon them. In order to meet
these peculiarities the travelling organs of aquatic and flying
animals (whether they be feet, fins, flippers or wings) are made
not of rigid but of elastic materials. The travelling organs,
moreover, increase in size in proportion to the tenuity of the fluid
to be acted upon. The difference in size of the travelling organs
of animals becomes very marked when the land animals are
contrasted with the aquatic, and the aquatic with the aerial,
as in figs. 1, 2 and 3.

The peculiarities of water and air as supporting media are well
illustrated by a reference to swimming, diving and flying birds.
A bird when swimming extends its feet simultaneously or alternately
in a backward direction, and so obtains a forward recoil.
The water supports the bird, and the feet simply propel. In
this case the bird is lighter than the water, and the long axis of
the body is horizontal (a of fig. 4). When the bird dives, or flies
under water, the long axis of the body is inclined obliquely downwards
and forwards, and the bird forces itself into and beneath the
water by the action of its feet, or wings, or both. In diving or sub-aquatic
flight the feet strike upwards and backwards, the wings
downwards and backwards (b of fig. 4). In aerial flying everything
is reversed. The long axis of the bird is inclined obliquely
upwards and forwards, and the wings strike, not downwards
and backwards, but downwards and forwards (c of fig. 4). These
changes in the direction of the long axis of the bird in swimming,
diving and flying, and in the direction of the stroke of the wings
in sub-aquatic and aerial flight, are due to the fact that the bird
is heavier than the air and lighter than the water.

The physical properties of water and air explain in a great
measure how the sailing ship differs from the balloon, and how
the latter differs from the flying creature and flying machine
constructed on the natural type. The sailing ship is, as it were,
immersed in two oceans, viz. an ocean of water and an ocean
of air&mdash;the former being greatly heavier and denser than the
latter. The ocean of water buoys or floats the ship, and the
ocean of air, or part of it in motion, swells the sails which propel
the ship. The moving air, which strikes the sails directly, strikes
the hull of the vessel indirectly and forces it through the water,
which, as explained, is a comparatively dense fluid. When the
503
ship is in motion it can be steered either by the sails alone, or by
the rudder alone, or by both combined. A balloon differs from
a sailing ship in being immersed in only one ocean, viz. the ocean
of air. It resembles the ship in floating upon the air, as the ship
floats upon the water; in other words, the balloon is lighter than
the air, as the ship is lighter than the water. But here all analogy
ceases. The ship, in virtue of its being immersed in two fluids
having different densities, can be steered and made to tack about
in a horizontal plane in any given direction. This in the case of
the balloon, immersed in one fluid, is impossible. The balloon
in a calm can only rise and fall in a vertical line. Its horizontal
movements, which ought to be the more important, are accidental
movements due to air currents, and cannot be controlled; the
balloon, in short, cannot be guided. One might as well attempt
to steer a boat carried along by currents of water in the absence
of oars, sails and wind, as to steer a balloon carried along by
currents of air. The balloon has no hold upon the air, and this
consequently cannot be employed as a fulcrum for regulating
its course. The balloon, because of its vast size and from its
being lighter than the air, is completely at the mercy of the wind.
It forms an integral part, so to speak, of the wind for the time
being, and the direction of the wind in every instance determines
the horizontal motion of the balloon. The force required to
propel a balloon against even a moderate breeze would result in its
destruction. The balloon cannot be transferred with any degree
of certainty from one point of the earth&rsquo;s surface to another,
and hence the chief danger in its employment. It may, quite as
likely as not, carry its occupants out to sea. The balloon is a
mere lifting machine and is in no sense to be regarded as a flying
machine. It resembles the flying creature only in this, that it is
immersed in the ocean of air in which it sustains itself. The mode
of suspension is wholly different. The balloon floats because it
is lighter than the air; the flying creature floats because it extracts
from the air, by the vigorous downward action of its wings,
a certain amount of upward recoil. The balloon is passive; the
flying creature is active. The balloon is controlled by the wind;
the flying creature controls the wind. The balloon in the absence
of wind can only rise and fall in a vertical line; the flying creature
can fly in a horizontal plane in any given direction. The balloon
is inefficient because of its levity; the flying creature is efficient
because of its weight.

Weight, however paradoxical it may appear, is necessary to
flight. Everything which flies is vastly heavier than the air.
The inertia of the mass of the flying creature enables it to control
and direct its movements in the air. Many are of opinion that
flight is a mere matter of levity and power. This is quite a mistake.
No machine, however light and powerful, will ever fly
whose travelling surfaces are not properly fashioned and properly
applied to the air.

It was supposed at one time that the air sacs of birds contributed
in some mysterious way to flight, but
this is now known to be erroneous.
The bats and some of the best-flying
birds have no air sacs. Similar remarks
are to be made of the heated
air imprisoned within the bones of
certain birds.1 Feathers even are not
necessary to flight. Insects and bats
have no feathers, and yet fly well.
The only facts in natural history
which appear even indirectly to
countenance the flotation theory are
the presence of a swimming bladder
in some fishes, and the existence of
membranous expansions or pseudo-wings
in certain animals, such as
the flying fish, flying dragon and
flying squirrel. As, however, the
animals referred to do not actually
fly, but merely dart into the air and
there sustain themselves for brief
intervals, they afford no real support
to the theory. The so-called floating
animals are depicted at figs. 5, 6 and 7.

(Draco haematopogon).

(Galeopithecus volans); also called

Fig. 7.&mdash;The Flying Fish (Exocoetus exiliens).

It has been asserted, and with some
degree of plausibility, that a fish
lighter than the water might swim, and that a bird lighter
than the air might fly: it ought, however, to be borne in mind
that, in point of fact, a fish lighter than the water could not hold
its own if the water were in the least perturbed, and that a bird
lighter than the air would be swept into space by even a moderate
504
breeze without hope of return. Weight and power are always
associated in living animals, and the fact that living animals are
made heavier than the medium they are to navigate may be
regarded as a conclusive argument in favour of weight being
necessary alike to the swimming of the fish and the flying of the
bird. It may be stated once for all that flying creatures are for
the most part as heavy, bulk for bulk, as other animals, and that
flight in every instance is the product, not of superior levity,
but of weight and power directed upon properly constructed
flying organs.

This fact is important as bearing on the construction of flying
machines. It shows that a flying machine need not necessarily
be a light, airy structure exposing an immoderate amount of
surface. On the contrary, it favours the belief that it should
be a compact and moderately heavy and powerful structure,
which trusts for elevation and propulsion entirely to its flying
appliances&mdash;whether actively moving wings, or screws, or aeroplanes
wedged forward by screws. It should attack and subdue
the air, and never give the air an opportunity of attacking or
subduing it. It should smite the air intelligently and as a master,
and its vigorous well-directed thrusts should in every instance
elicit an upward and forward recoil. The flying machine must be
multum in parvo. It must launch itself in the ocean of air, and
must extract from that air, by means of its travelling surfaces&mdash;however
fashioned and however applied&mdash;the recoil or resistance
necessary to elevate and carry it forward. Extensive inert
surfaces indeed are contra-indicated in a flying machine, as they
approximate it to the balloon, which, as has been shown, cannot
maintain its position in the air if there are air currents. A flying
machine which could not face air currents would necessarily be
a failure. To obviate this difficulty we are forced to fall back
upon weight, or rather the structures and appliances which weight
represents. These appliances as indicated should not be unnecessarily
expanded, but when expanded they should, wherever
practicable, be converted into actively moving flying surfaces,
in preference to fixed or inert dead surfaces.

The question of surface is a very important one in aviation:
it naturally resolves itself into one of active and passive surface.
As there are active and passive surfaces in the flying animal,
so there are, or should be, active and passive surfaces in the flying
machine. Art should follow nature in this matter. The active
surfaces in flying creatures are always greatly in excess of the
passive ones, from the fact that the former virtually increase in
proportion to the spaces through which they are made to travel.
Nature not only distinguishes between active and passive surfaces
in flying animals, but she strikes a just balance between them,
and utilizes both. She regulates the surfaces to the strength and
weight of the flying creature and the air currents to which the
surfaces are to be exposed and upon which they are to operate.
In her calculations she never forgets that her flying subjects are
to control and not to be controlled by the air. As a rule she
reduces the passive surfaces of the body to a minimum; she
likewise reduces as far as possible the actively moving or flying
surfaces. While, however, diminishing the surfaces of the flying
animal as a whole, she increases as occasion demands the active
or wing surfaces by wing movements, and the passive or dead
surfaces by the forward motion of the body in progressive
flight. She knows that if the wings are driven with sufficient
rapidity they practically convert the spaces through which they
move into solid bases of support; she also knows that the body
in rapid flight derives support from all the air over which it passes.
The manner in which the wing surfaces are increased by the
wing movements will be readily understood from the accompanying
illustrations of the blow-fly with its wings at rest and in
motion (figs. 8 and 9). In fig. 8 the surfaces exposed by the body
of the insect and the wings are, as compared with those of fig. 9,
trifling. The wing would have much less purchase on fig. 8 than
on fig. 9, provided the surfaces exposed by the latter were passive
or dead surfaces. But they are not dead surfaces: they represent
the spaces occupied by the rapidly vibrating wings, which are
actively moving flying organs. As, moreover, the wings travel at
a much higher speed than any wind that blows, they are superior
to and control the wind; they enable the insect to dart through
the wind in whatever direction it pleases.

The reader has only to imagine figs. 8 and 9 cut out in paper to
realize that extensive, inert, horizontal aeroplanes2 in a flying
machine would be a mistake. It is found to be so practically,
as will be shown by and by. Fig. 9 so cut out would be heavier
than fig. 8, and if both were exposed to a current of air, fig. 9
would be more blown about than fig. 8.

It is true that in beetles and certain other insects there are the
elytra or wing cases&mdash;thin, light, horny structures inclined
slightly upwards&mdash;which in the act of flight are spread out
and act as sustainers or gliders. The elytra, however, are comparatively
long narrow structures which occupy a position in
front of the wings, of which they may be regarded as forming
the anterior parts. The elytra are to the delicate wings of some
insects what the thick anterior margins are to stronger wings.
The elytra, moreover, are not wholly passive structures. They
can be moved, and the angles made by their under surfaces with
the horizon adjusted. Finally, they are not essential to flight,
as flight in the great majority of instances is performed without
them. The elytra serve as protectors to the wings when the
wings are folded upon the back of the insect, and as they are
extended on either side of the body more or less horizontally when
the insect is flying they contribute to flight indirectly, in virtue
of their being carried forward by the body in motion.

Natural Flight.&mdash;The manner in which the wings of the insect
traverse the air, so as practically to increase the basis of support,
raises the whole subject of natural flight. It is necessary, therefore,
at this stage to direct the attention of the reader somewhat
fully to the subject of flight, as witnessed in the insect, bird and
bat, a knowledge of natural flight preceding, and being in some
sense indispensable to, a knowledge of artificial flight. The
bodies of flying creatures are, as a rule, very strong, comparatively
light and of an elongated form,&mdash;the bodies of birds being
specially adapted for cleaving the air. Flying creatures, however,
are less remarkable for their strength, shape and comparative
levity than for the size and extraordinarily rapid and complicated
movements of their wings. Prof. J. Bell Pettigrew first satisfactorily
analysed those movements, and reproduced them by
the aid of artificial wings. This physiologist in 18673 showed
that all natural wings, whether of the insect, bird or bat, are
screws structurally, and that they act as screws when they are
made to vibrate, from the fact that they twist in opposite
directions during the down and up strokes. He also explained
that all wings act upon a common principle, and that they
present oblique, kite-like surfaces to the air, through which they
pass much in the same way that an oar passes through water
in sculling. He further pointed out that the wings of flying
creatures (contrary to received opinions, and as has been already
indicated) strike downwards and forwards during the down
strokes, and upwards and forwards during the up strokes. Lastly
he demonstrated that the wings of flying creatures, when the
505
bodies of said creatures are fixed, describe figure-of-8 tracks in
space&mdash;the figure-of-8 tracks, when the bodies are released and
advancing as in rapid flight, being opened out and converted
into waved tracks.


It may be well to explain here that a claim has been set up by his
admirers for the celebrated artist, architect and engineer, Leonardo
da Vinci, to be regarded as the discoverer of the principles and
practice of flight (see Theodore Andrea Cook, Spirals in Nature and
Art, 1903). The claim is, however, unwarranted; Leonardo&rsquo;s chief
work on flight, bearing the title Codice sul Volo degli Uccelli e Varie
Altre Materie, written in 1505, consists of a short manuscript of
twenty-seven small quarto pages, with simple sketch illustrations
interspersed in the text. In addition he makes occasional references
to flight in his other manuscripts, which are also illustrated. In
none of Leonardo&rsquo;s manuscripts, however, and in none of his figures,
is the slightest hint given of his having any knowledge of the spiral
movements made by the wing in flight or of the spiral structure of the
wing itself. It is claimed that Leonardo knew the direction of the
stroke of the wing, as revealed by recent researches and proved by
modern instantaneous photography. As a matter of fact, Leonardo
gives a wholly inaccurate account of the direction of the stroke of
the wing. He states that the wing during the down stroke strikes
downwards and backwards, whereas in reality it strikes downwards
and forwards. In speaking of artificial flight Leonardo says: &ldquo;The
wings have to row downwards and backwards to support the machine
on high, so that it moves forward.&rdquo; In speaking of natural flight he
remarks: &ldquo;If in its descent the bird rows backwards with its wings
the bird will move rapidly; this happens because the wings strike
the air which successively runs behind the bird to fill the void
whence it comes.&rdquo; There is nothing in Leonardo&rsquo;s writings to show
that he knew either the anatomy or physiology of the wing in the
modern sense.


Pettigrew&rsquo;s discovery of the figure-of-8 and waved movements
made by the wing in stationary and progressive flight was confirmed
some two years after it was made by Prof. E.J. Marey
of Paris4 by the aid of the &ldquo;sphygmograph.&rdquo;5 The movements
in question are now regarded as fundamental, from the fact
that they are alike essential to natural and artificial flight.

The following is Pettigrew&rsquo;s description of wings and wing
movements published in 1867:&mdash;



Fig. 10.&mdash;Right Wing of the Beetle (Goliathus
micans) when at rest; seen from above.

Fig. 11.&mdash;Right Wing of the Beetle (Goliathus
micans) when in motion; seen from
behind. This figure shows how the wing twists
and untwists when in action, and how it forms
a true screw.


&ldquo;The wings of insects and birds are, as a rule, more or less triangular
in shape, the base of the triangle being directed towards the
body, its sides anteriorly and posteriorly. They are also conical on
section from within outwards and from before backwards, this shape
converting the pinions into delicately graduated instruments balanced
with the utmost nicety to satisfy the requirements of the muscular
system on the one hand and the resistance and resiliency of the air
on the other. While all wings are graduated as explained, innumerable
varieties occur as to their general contour, some being falcated
or scythe-like, others oblong, others rounded or circular, some lanceolate
and some linear. The wings of insects may consist either of one
or two pairs&mdash;the anterior or upper pair, when two are present,
being in some instances greatly modified and presenting a corneous
condition. They are then known as elytra, from the Gr. &#7956;&#955;&#965;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;,
a sheath. Both pairs are composed of a duplicature of the integument,
or investing membrane, and are strengthened in various directions
by a system of hollow, horny tubes, known to entomologists as
the neurae or nervures. These nervures taper towards the extremity
of the wing, and are strongest towards its root and anterior margin,
where they supply the place of the arm in birds and bats. The neurae
are arranged at the axis of the wing after the manner of a fan or
spiral stair&mdash;the anterior one occupying a higher position than that
farther back, and so of the others. As this arrangement extends also
to the margins, the wings are more or less twisted upon themselves
and present a certain degree of convexity on their superior or upper
surface, and a corresponding concavity on their inferior or under
surface,&mdash;their free edges supplying those fine curves which act with
such efficacy upon the air in obtaining the maximum of resistance
and the minimum of displacement. As illustrative examples of the
form of wings alluded to, those of the beetle, bee and fly may be cited&mdash;the
pinions in those insects acting as helices, or twisted levers, and
elevating weights much greater than the area of the wings would seem
to warrant&rdquo; (figs. 10 and 11).... &ldquo;To confer on the wings the
multiplicity of movements which they require, they are supplied
with double hinge or compound joints, which enable them to move
not only in an upward, downward, forward and backward direction,
but also at various intermediate degrees of obliquity. An insect with
wings thus hinged may, as far as steadiness of body is concerned, be
not inaptly compared to a compass set upon gimbals, where the universality
of motion in one direction ensures comparative fixedness
in another.&rdquo;... &ldquo;All wings obtain their leverage by presenting
oblique surfaces to
the air, the degree
of obliquity gradually
increasing in a
direction from behind,
forwards and
downwards, during
extension when the
sudden or effective
stroke is being given,
and gradually decreasing
in an opposite
direction during
flexion, or when the
wing is being more
slowly recovered preparatory
to making
a second stroke. The
effective stroke in
insects, and this
holds true also of
birds, is therefore delivered downwards and forwards, and not, as the
majority of writers believe, vertically, or even slightly backwards....
The wing in the insect is more flattened than in the bird; and advantage
is taken on some occasions of this circumstance, particularly in
heavy-bodied, small-winged, quick-flying insects, to reverse the pinion
more or less completely during the down and up strokes.&rdquo;... &ldquo;This
is effected in the following manner. The posterior margin of
the wing is made to rotate, during the down stroke, in a direction
from above downwards and from behind forwards&mdash;the anterior
margin travelling in an opposite direction and reciprocating.
The wing may thus be said to attack the air by a screwing
movement from above. During the up or return stroke, on the other
hand, the posterior margin rotates in a direction from below upwards
and from before backwards, so that by a similar but reverse screwing
motion the pinion attacks the air from beneath.&rdquo;... &ldquo;A figure-of-8,
compressed laterally and placed obliquely with its long axis running
from left to right of the spectator, represents the movements in
question. The down and up strokes, as will be seen from this account,
cross each other, the wing smiting the air during its descent from
above, as in the bird and bat, and during its ascent from below as
in the flying fish and boy&rsquo;s kite&rdquo; (fig. 12).



Fig. 12 shows the figure-of-8 made by the margins of the wing in
extension (continuous line), and flexion (dotted line). As the tip of
the wing is mid-way between its margins, a line between the continuous
and dotted lines gives the figure-of-8 made by the tip. The
arrows indicate the reversal of the planes of the wing, and show how
the down and up strokes cross each other.

... &ldquo;The figure-of-8 action of the wing explains how an insect
or bird may fix itself in the air, the backward and forward reciprocating
action of the pinion affording support, but no propulsion.
In these instances the backward and forward strokes are made to
counterbalance each other. Although the figure-of-8 represents with
considerable fidelity the twisting of the wing upon its axis during
extension and flexion, when the insect is playing its wings before an
object, or still better when it is artificially fixed, it is otherwise when
the down stroke is added and the insect is fairly on the wing and progressing
rapidly. In this case the wing, in virtue of its being carried
forward by the body in motion, describes an undulating or spiral
course, as shown in fig. 13.&rdquo;

... &ldquo;The down and up strokes are compound movements&mdash;the
termination of the down stroke embracing the beginning of the
up stroke, and the termination of the up stroke including the beginning
of the down stroke. This is necessary in order that the down
and up strokes may glide into each other in such a manner as to
prevent jerking and unnecessary retardation.&rdquo;6...

as seen from behind. These show the
screw-like configuration of the wing, and
also how the wing twists and untwists
during its action.

&ldquo;The wing of the bird, like that of the insect, is concavo-convex,
and more or less twisted upon itself when extended, so that the anterior
or thick margin of the pinion presents a different degree of curvature
to that of the posterior or thin margin. This twisting is in a great
measure owing to the manner in which the bones of the wing are
twisted upon themselves, and the spiral nature of their articular
surfaces&mdash;the long axes of the joints always intersecting each other
at right angles, and the bones of the elbow and wrist making a quarter
of a turn or so during extension and the same amount during flexion.
As a result of this disposition of the articular surfaces, the wing may
be shot out or extended, and retracted or flexed in nearly the same
plane, the bones composing the wing rotating on their axes during
either movement (fig. 14). The secondary action, or the revolving of
the component bones on their own axes, is of the greatest importance
in the movements of the wing, as it communicates to the hand and
forearm, and consequently to the primary and secondary feathers
which they bear, the precise angles necessary for flight. It in fact
ensures that the wing, and the curtain or fringe of the wing which
the primary and secondary feathers form, shall be screwed into and
down upon the wind in extension, and unscrewed or withdrawn
from the wind during flexion. The wing of the bird may therefore
be compared to a huge gimlet or auger, the axis of the gimlet representing
the bones of the wing, the flanges or spiral thread of the gimlet
the primary and secondary
feathers&rdquo; (figs. 15 and 16)....
&ldquo;From this description
it will be evident that
by the mere rotation of the
bones of the forearm and
hand the maximum and
minimum of resistance is
secured much in the same
way that this object is
attained by the alternate
dipping and feathering of
an oar.&rdquo;... &ldquo;The wing, both when at rest and when in motion,
may not inaptly be compared to the blade of an ordinary screw
propeller as employed in navigation. Thus the general outline of
the wing corresponds closely
with the outline of the
propeller (figs. 11, 16 and
18), and the track described
by the wing in space is
twisted upon itself propeller
fashion7 (figs. 12, 20, 21,
22, 23). The great velocity
with which the wing is
driven converts the impression
or blur made by it
into what is equivalent to a
solid for the time being, in the same way that the spokes of a wheel
in violent motion, as is well understood, more or less completely
occupy the space contained within the rim or circumference of the
wheel&rdquo; (figs. 9, 20 and 21).

... &ldquo;The wing of the bat bears a considerable resemblance to
that of the insect, inasmuch as it consists of a delicate, semi-transparent,
continuous
membrane, supported in
divers directions, particularly
towards its
anterior margin, by a
system of osseous stays
or stretchers which confer
upon it the degree
of rigidity requisite for
flight. It is, as a rule,
deeply concave on its
under or ventral surface,
and in this respect resembles
the wing of the
heavy-bodied birds. The movement of the bat&rsquo;s wing in extension
is a spiral one, the spiral running alternately from below upwards
and forwards and from above downwards and backwards. The
action of the wing of the bat, and the movements of its component
bones, are essentially
the same as in the bird&rdquo;
(figs. 17 and 18).

... &ldquo;The wing strikes
the air precisely as a
boy&rsquo;s kite would if it
were jerked by its string,
the only difference being
that the kite is pulled
forwards upon the wind
by the string and the
hand, whereas in the
insect, bird and bat
the wing is pushed forwards on the wind by the weight of the body
and the power residing in the pinion itself&rdquo; (fig. 19).8




Fig. 19.&mdash;The Cape Barn-owl (Strix capensis), showing the kite-like
surfaces presented by the ventral aspect of the wings and body
in flight.

The figure-of-8 and kite-like action of the wing referred to
lead us to explain how it happens that the wing, which in many
instances is a comparatively small and delicate organ, can yet
attack the air with such vigour as to extract from it the recoil
necessary to elevate and propel the flying creature. The accompanying
figures from one of Pettigrew&rsquo;s later memoirs9 will
serve to explain the rationale (figs. 20, 21, 22 and 23).

As will be seen from these figures, the wing during its vibration
sweeps through a comparatively very large space. This space,
as already explained, is practically a solid basis of support for
the wing and for the flying animal. The wing attacks the air
in such a manner as virtually to have no slip&mdash;this for two
reasons. The wing reverses instantly and acts as a kite during
nearly the entire down and up strokes. The angles, moreover,
made by the wing with the horizon during the down and up
strokes are at no two intervals the same, but (and this is a
507
remarkable circumstance) they are always adapted to the speed
at which the wing is travelling for the time being. The increase
and decrease in the angles made by the wing as it hastens to
and fro are due partly to the resistance offered by the air, and
partly to the mechanism and mode of application of the wing
to the air. The wing, during its vibrations, rotates upon two
separate centres, the tip rotating round the root of the wing as
an axis (short axis of wing), the posterior margin rotating around
the anterior margin (long axis of wing). The wing is really
eccentric in its nature, a remark which applies also to the rowing
feathers of the bird&rsquo;s wing. The compound rotation goes on
throughout the entire down and up strokes, and is intimately
associated with the power which the wing enjoys of alternately
seizing and evading the air.



Figs. 20, 21, 22 and 23 show the area mapped out by the left wing
of the Wasp when the insect is fixed and the wing made to vibrate.
These figures illustrate the various angles made by the wing with the
horizon as it hastens to and fro, and show how the wing reverses and
reciprocates, and how it twists upon itself in opposite directions, and
describes a figure-of-8 track in space. Figs. 20 and 22 represent the
forward or down stroke (a b c d e f g), figs. 21 and 23 the backward
or up stroke (g h i j k l a). The terms forward and back strokes are
here employed with reference to the head of the insect, x, x&prime;, line
to represent the horizon. If fig. 22, representing the down or forward
stroke, be placed upon fig. 23, representing the up or backward
stroke, it will be seen that the wing crosses its own track more or less
completely at every stage of the down and up strokes.

The compound rotation of the wing is greatly facilitated by
the wing being elastic and flexible. It is this which causes the
wing to twist and untwist diagonally on its long axis when it is
made to vibrate. The twisting referred to is partly a vital and
partly a mechanical act;&mdash;that is, it is occasioned in part by
the action of the muscles and in part by the greater resistance
experienced from the air by the tip and posterior margin of the
wing as compared with the root and anterior margin,&mdash;the resistance
experienced by the tip and posterior margin causing
them to reverse always subsequently to the root and anterior
margin, which has the effect of throwing the anterior and posterior
margins of the wing into figure-of-8 curves, as shown at figs.
9, 11, 12, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22 and 23.

The compound rotation of the wing, as seen in the bird, is
represented in fig. 24.

Not the least curious feature of the wing movements is the
remarkable power which the wing possesses of making and
utilizing its own currents. Thus, when the wing descends it
draws after it a strong current, which, being met by the wing
during its ascent, greatly increases the efficacy of the up stroke.
Similarly and conversely, when the wing ascends, it creates an
upward current, which, being met by the wing when it descends,
powerfully contributes to the efficiency of the down stroke.
This statement can be readily verified by experiment both with
natural and artificial wings. Neither the up nor the down strokes
are complete in themselves.

The wing to act efficiently must be driven at a certain speed,
and in such a manner that the down and up strokes shall glide
into each other. It is only in this way that the air can be made
to pulsate, and that the rhythm of the wing and the air waves
can be made to correspond. The air must be seized and let go
in a certain order and at a certain speed to extract a maximum
recoil. The rapidity of the wing movements is regulated by the
size of the wing, small wings being driven at a very much higher
speed than larger ones. The different parts of the wing, moreover,
travel at different degrees of velocity&mdash;the tip and posterior
margin of the wing always rushing through a much greater
space, in a given time, than the root and anterior margin.

Fig. 26.&mdash;In this figure f, f&rsquo; represent
the movable fulcra furnished by the
air, p p&rsquo; the power residing in the wing,
and b the body to be moved. In order
to make the problem of flight more intelligible,
the lever formed by the wing
is prolonged beyond the body (b), and
to the root of the wing so extended the
weight (w, w&prime;) is attached; x represents
the universal joint by which the wing
is attached to the body. When the
wing ascends as shown at p, the air
(fulcrum f) resists its upward passage,
and forces the body (b) or its representative
(w) slightly downwards.
When the wing descends as shown at
p&rsquo;, the air (fulcrum f&prime;) resists its downward
passage, and forces the body (b)
or its representative (w&prime;) slightly upwards.
From this it follows that when
the wing rises the body falls, and vice
versa&mdash;the wing describing the arc of
a large circle (f f&prime;), the body (b), or the
weights (w, w&prime;) representing it, describing
the arc of a small circle.

The rapidity of travel of the insect wing is in some cases
enormous. The wasp, for instance, is said to ply its wings at
the rate of 110, and the common house-fly at the rate of 330
beats per second. Quick as are the vibrations of natural wings,
the speed of certain parts of the wing is amazingly increased.
Wings as a rule are long and narrow. As a consequence, a
comparatively slow and very
limited movement at the root
confers great range and immense
speed at the tip, the
speed of each portion of the
wing increasing as the root of
the wing is receded from. This
is explained on a principle well
understood in mechanics, viz.
that when a wing or rod
hinged at one end is made to
move in a circle, the tip or
free end of the wing or rod
describes a much wider circle
in a given time than a portion
of the wing or rod nearer the
hinge (fig. 25).

One naturally inquires why
the high speed of wings, and
why the progressive increase
of speed at their tips and
posterior margins? The
answer is not far to seek. If
the wings were not driven at
a high speed, and if they were
not eccentrics made to revolve
upon two separate axes, they
would of necessity be large
cumbrous structures; but
large heavy wings would be difficult to work, and what is
worse, they would (if too large), instead of controlling the
air, be controlled by it, and so cease to be flying organs.

There is, however, another reason why wings should be made
to vibrate at high speeds. The air, as explained, is a very light,
thin, elastic medium, which yields on the slightest pressure, and
unless the wings attacked it with great violence the necessary
recoil or resistance could not be obtained. The atmosphere,
because of its great tenuity, mobility and comparative imponderability,
presents little resistance to bodies passing through it at
low velocities. If, however, the speed be greatly accelerated,
508
the action of even an ordinary cane is sufficient to elicit a recoil.
This comes of the action and reaction of matter, the resistance
experienced varying according to the density of the atmosphere
and the shape, extent and velocity of the body acting upon it.
While, therefore, scarcely any impediment is offered to the progress
of an animal in motion in the air, it is often exceedingly
difficult to compress the air with sufficient rapidity and energy
to convert it into a suitable fulcrum for securing the necessary
support and forward impetus. This arises from the fact that
bodies moving in air experience a minimum of resistance and
occasion a maximum of displacement. Another and very obvious
difficulty is traceable to the great disparity in the weight of air
as compared with any known solid, and the consequent want of
buoying or sustaining power which that disparity involves. If
we compare air with water we find it is nearly 1000 times lighter.
To meet these peculiarities the insect, bird and bat are furnished
with extensive flying surfaces in the shape of wings, which they
apply with singular velocity and power to the air, as levers of
the third order. In this form of lever the power is applied
between the fulcrum and the weight to be raised. The power
is represented by the wing, the fulcrum by the air, and the
weight by the body of the flying animal. Although the third
order of lever is particularly inefficient when the fulcrum is rigid
and immobile, it possesses singular advantages when these
conditions are reversed, that is, when the fulcrum, as happens
with the air, is elastic and yielding. In this instance a very slight
movement at the root of the pinion, or that end of the lever
directed towards the body,
is followed by an immense
sweep of the extremity of
the wing, where its elevating
and propelling power
is greatest&mdash;this arrangement
ensuring that the
large quantity of air
necessary for support and
propulsion shall be compressed
under the most
favourable conditions.

In this process the
weight of the body performs
an important part,
by acting upon the inclined
planes formed by
the wings in the plane of
progression. The power
and the weight may thus
be said to reciprocate, the
two sitting as it were side
by side and blending their
peculiar influences to produce
a common result, as
indicated at fig. 26.

When the wings descend
they elevate the body, the
wings being active and
the body passive; when
the body descends it contributes
to the elevation of
the wings,10 the body being
active and the wings more or less passive. It is in this way that
weight forms a factor in flight, the wings and the weight of the body
reciprocating and mutually assisting and relieving each other.
This is an argument for employing four wings in artificial flight,&mdash;the
wings being so arranged that the two which are up shall
always by their fall mechanically elevate the two which are
down. Such an arrangement is calculated greatly to conserve
the driving power, and as a consequence, to reduce the weight.



Fig. 27.&mdash;a, b, quill feathers; c,
cork; d, e, f, g, downward and forward
curved trajectory made by the
feathers and cork before reaching the
ground (h, i).

That the weight of the body plays an important part in the
production of flight may be proved by a very simple experiment.
If two quill feathers are fixed in an ordinary cork, and so arranged
that they expand and arch
above it (fig. 27), it is found
that if the apparatus be
dropped from a vertical
height of 3 yds. it does
not fall vertically downwards,
but downwards and
forwards in a curve, the
forward travel amounting
in some instances to a yard
and a half. Here the cork,
in falling, acts upon the
feathers (which are to all
intents and purposes wings),
and these in turn act upon
the air, in such a manner as
to produce a horizontal
transference.

In order to utilize the air
as a means of transit, the body in motion, whether it moves
in virtue of the life it possesses, or because of a force super-added,
must be heavier than air. It must tread with its
wings and rise upon the air as a swimmer upon the water,
or as a kite upon the wind. This is necessary for the simple
reason that the body must be active, the air passive. The
flying body must act against gravitation, and elevate and
carry itself forward at the expense of the air and of the force
which resides in it, whatever that may be. If it were otherwise&mdash;if
it were rescued from the law of gravitation on the
one hand, and bereft of independent movement on the other,
it would float about uncontrolled and uncontrollable like an
ordinary balloon.

In flight one of two things is necessary. Either the wings must
attack the air with great violence, or the air in rapid motion must
attack the wings: either suffices. If a bird attempts to fly in a
calm, the wings must be made to smite the air after the manner
of a boy&rsquo;s kite with great vigour and at a high speed. In this
case the wings fly the bird. If, however, the bird is fairly
launched in space and a stiff breeze is blowing, all that is required
in many instances is to extend the wings at a slight upward
angle to the horizon so that the under parts of the wings present
kite-like surfaces. In these circumstances the rapidly moving
air flies the bird. The flight of the albatross supplies the necessary
illustration. If by any chance this magnificent bird alights
upon the sea he must flap and beat the water and air with his
wings with tremendous energy until he gets fairly launched.
This done he extends his enormous pinions11 and sails majestically
along, seldom deigning to flap his wings, the breeze doing the
work for him. A familiar illustration of the same principle may
be witnessed any day when children are engaged in the pastime
of kite-flying. If two boys attempt to fly a kite in a calm, the
one must hold up the kite and let go when the other runs. In
this case the under surface of the kite is made to strike the still
air. If, however, a stiff autumn breeze be blowing, it suffices if
the boy who formerly ran when the kite was let go stands still.
In this case the air in rapid motion strikes the under surface
of the kite and forces it up. The string and the hand are to the
kite what the weight of the flying creature is to the inclined
planes formed by its wings.

The area of the insect, bird and bat, when the wings are fully
expanded, is greater than that of any other class of animal,
their weight being proportionally less. As already stated,
however, it ought never to be forgotten that even the lightest
insect, bird or bat is vastly heavier than the air, and that no
fixed relation exists between the weight of body and expanse
of wing in any of the orders. We have thus light-bodied and
509
large-winged insects and birds, as the butterfly and heron; and
others with heavy bodies and small wings, as the beetle and
partridge. Similar remarks are to be made of bats. Those
apparent inconsistencies in the dimensions of the body and wings
are readily explained by the greater muscular development
of the heavy-bodied, small-winged insects, birds and bats, and
the increased power and rapidity with which the wings in them
are made to oscillate. This is of the utmost importance in the
science of aviation, as showing that flight may be attained by a
heavy powerful animal with comparatively small wings, as well
as by a lighter one with greatly enlarged wings. While, therefore,
there is apparently no correspondence between the area of the
wing and the animal to be raised, there is, except in the case of
sailing insects, birds and bats, an unvarying relation as to the
weight and number of oscillations; so that the problem of flight
would seem to resolve itself into one of weight, power, velocity
and small surfaces, versus buoyancy, debility, diminished speed
and extensive surfaces&mdash;weight in either case being a sine qua
non.



Fig. 28.&mdash;Hawk and Pigeon.

That no fixed relation exists between the area of the wings and
the size and weight of the body to
be elevated is evident on comparing
the dimensions of the wings and
bodies of the several orders of insects,
bats and birds. If such comparison
be made, it will be found that the
pinions in some instances diminish
while the bodies increase, and the
converse. No practical good can
therefore accrue to aviation from
elaborate measurements of the wings
and body of any flying thing; neither
can any rule be laid down as to the
extent of surface required for sustaining
a given weight in the air.
The statements here advanced are
borne out by the fact that the wings
of insects, bats and birds may be
materially reduced without impairing
their powers of flight. In such
cases the speed with which the
wings are driven is increased in
the direct ratio of the mutilation.
The inference to be deduced from the foregoing is plainly this,
that even in large-bodied, small-winged insects and birds the
wing-surface is greatly in excess, the surplus wing area supplying
that degree of elevating and sustaining power which is necessary
to prevent undue exertion on the part of the volant animal. In
this we have a partial explanation of the buoyancy of insects,
and the great lifting power possessed by birds and bats,&mdash;the
bats carrying their young without inconvenience, the birds elevating
surprising quantities of fish, game, carrion, &amp;c. (fig. 28).

While as explained, no definite relation exists between the
weight of a flying animal and the size of its flying surfaces, there
being, as stated, heavy-bodied and small-winged insects, birds
and bats, and the converse, and while, as has been shown, flight
is possible within a wide range, the wings being, as a rule, in
excess of what are required for the purposes of flight,&mdash;still it
appears from the researches of L. de Lucy that there is a general
law, to the effect that the larger the volant animal, the smaller,
by comparison, are its flying surfaces. The existence of such
a law is very encouraging so far as artificial flight is concerned,
for it shows that the flying surfaces of a large, heavy, powerful
flying machine will be comparatively small, and consequently
comparatively compact and strong. This is a point of very
considerable importance, as the object desiderated in a flying
machine is elevating capacity.

De Lucy tabulated his results as under:&mdash;

&ldquo;It is easy, by the aid of this table, to follow the order, always
decreasing, of the surfaces, in proportion as the winged animal increases
in size and weight. Thus, in comparing the insects with one
another, we find that the gnat, which weighs 460 times less than the
stag-beetle, has 14 times more of surface. The lady-bird weighs
150 times less than the stag-beetle, and possesses 5 times more of
surface, &amp;c. It is the same with the birds. The sparrow weighs
about 10 times less than the pigeon, and has twice as much surface.
The pigeon weighs about 8 times less than the stork, and has twice
as much surface. The sparrow weighs 339 times less than the
Australian crane, and possesses 7 times more surface, &amp;c. If now
we compare the insects and the birds, the gradation will become
even much more striking. The gnat, for example, weighs 97,000
times less than the pigeon, and has 40 times more surface; it weighs
three millions of times less than the crane of Australia, and possesses
140 times more of surface than this latter, the weight of which is
about 9 kilogrammes 500 grammes (25 &#8468; 5 oz. 9 dwt. troy, 20 &#8468; 15 oz.
2Â¼ dr. avoirdupois).

&ldquo;The Australian crane, the heaviest bird weighed, is that which has
the smallest amount of surface, for, referred to the kilogramme, it
does not give us a surface of more than 899 square centimetres (139
sq. in.), that is to say, about an eleventh part of a square metre.
But every one knows that these grallatorial animals are excellent
birds of flight. Of all travelling birds they undertake the longest
and most remote journeys. They are, in addition, the eagle excepted,
the birds which elevate themselves the highest, and the flight of which
is the longest maintained.&rdquo;12


The way in which the natural wing rises and falls on the air,
and reciprocates with the body of the flying creature, has a very
obvious bearing upon artificial flight. In natural flight the body
of the flying creature falls slightly forward in a curve when the
510
wing ascends, and is slightly elevated in a curve when the wing
descends. The wing and body are consequently always playing
at cross purposes, the wing rising when the body is falling and
vice versa. The alternate rise and fall of the body and wing of
the bird are well seen when contemplating the flight of the gull
from the stern of a steamboat, as the bird is following in the wake
of the vessel. The complementary movements referred to are
indicated at fig. 29, where the continuous waved line represents
the trajectory made by the wing, and the dotted waved line that
made by the body. As will be seen from this figure, the wing
advances both when it rises and when it falls. It is a peculiarity
of natural wings, and of artificial wings constructed on the
principle of living wings, that when forcibly elevated or depressed,
even in a strictly vertical direction, they inevitably dart forward.
If, for instance, the wing is suddenly depressed in a vertical
direction, as at a b of fig. 29, it at once darts downwards and
forwards in a double curve (see continuous line of figure) to c,
thus converting the vertical down stroke into a down, oblique,
forward stroke. If, again, the wing be suddenly elevated in a
strictly vertical direction, as at c d, the wing as certainly darts
upwards and forwards in a double curve to e, thus converting
the vertical up strokes into an upward, oblique, forward stroke.
The same thing happens when the wing is depressed from e to f
and elevated from g to h, the wing describing a waved track as at
e g, g i.



Fig. 29 shows how in progressive flight the wing and the body
describe waved tracks,&mdash;the crests of the waves made by the wing
(a, c, e, g, i) being placed opposite the crests of the waves made by
the body (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

There are good reasons why the wings should always be in
advance of the body. A bird when flying is a body in motion;
but a body in motion tends to fall not vertically downwards,
but downwards and forwards. The wings consequently must
be made to strike forwards and kept in advance of the body of the
bird if they are to prevent the bird from falling downwards and
forwards. If the wings were to strike backwards in aerial flight,
the bird would turn a forward somersault.

That the wings invariably strike forwards during the down and
up strokes in aerial flight is proved alike by observation and
experiment. If any one watches a bird rising from the ground
or the water, he cannot fail to perceive that the head and body
are slightly tilted upwards, and that the wings are made to
descend with great vigour in a downward and forward direction.
The dead natural wing and a properly constructed artificial
wing act in precisely the same way. If the wing of a gannet,
just shot, be removed and made to flap in what the operator
believes to be a strictly vertical downward direction, the tip of
the wing, in spite of him, will dart forwards between 2 and 3 ft.&mdash;the
amount of forward movement being regulated by the
rapidity of the down stroke. This is a very striking experiment.
The same thing happens with a properly constructed artificial
wing. The down stroke with the artificial as with the natural
wing is invariably converted into an oblique, downward and
forward stroke. No one ever saw a bird in the air flapping its
wings towards its tail. The old idea was that the wings during
the down stroke pushed the body of the bird in an upward and
forward direction; in reality the wings do not push but pull, and
in order to pull they must always be in advance of the body to
be flown. If the wings did not themselves fly forward, they could
not possibly cause the body of the bird to fly forward. It is the
wings which cause the bird to fly.

It only remains to be stated that the wing acts as a true kite,
during both the down and the up strokes, its under concave
or biting surface, in virtue of the forward travel communicated
to it by the body of the flying creature, being closely applied
to the air, during both its ascent and its descent. This explains
how the wing furnishes a persistent buoyancy alike when it rises
and when it falls (fig. 30).



Fig. 30 shows the kite-like action of the wing during the down and
up strokes, how the angles made by the wing with the horizon (a, b)
vary at every stage of these strokes, and how the wing evades the
superimposed air during the up stroke, and seizes the nether air
during the down stroke. In this figure the spaces between the double
dotted lines (c g, i b) represent the down strokes, the single dotted line
(h, i) representing the up stroke. The kite-like surfaces and angles
made by the wing with the horizon (a, b) during the down strokes
are indicated at c d e f g, j k l m,&mdash;those made during the up strokes
being indicated at g h i. As the down and up strokes run into each
other, and the convex surface of the wing is always directed upwards
and the concave surface downwards, it follows that the upper surface
of the wing evades in a great measure the upper air, while the under
surface seizes the nether air. It is easy to understand from this
figure how the wing always flying forwards furnishes a persistent
buoyancy.

The natural kite formed by the wing differs from the artificial
kite only in this, that the former is capable of being moved in
all its parts, and is more or less flexible and elastic, whereas the
latter is comparatively rigid. The flexibility and elasticity of
the kite formed by the natural wing are rendered necessary by
the fact that the wing, as already stated, is practically hinged
at its root and along its anterior margin, an arrangement which
necessitates its several parts travelling at different degrees of
speed, in proportion as they are removed from the axes of
rotation. Thus the tip travels at a higher speed than the root,
and the posterior margin than the anterior margin. This begets a
twisting diagonal movement of the wing on its long axis, which, but
for the elasticity referred to, would break the wing into fragments.
The elasticity contributes also to the continuous play of the wing,
and ensures that no two parts of it shall reverse at exactly the
same instant. If the wing was inelastic, every part of it would
reverse at precisely the same moment, and its vibration would be
characterized by pauses or dead points at the end of the down
and up strokes which would be fatal to it as a flying organ.
The elastic properties of the wing are absolutely essential, when
the mechanism and movements of the pinion are taken into
account. A rigid wing can never be an effective flying instrument.

The kite-like surfaces referred to in natural flight are those
upon which the constructors of flying machines very properly
ground their hopes of ultimate success. These surfaces may be
conferred on artificial wings, aeroplanes, aerial screws or similar
structures; and these structures, if we may judge from what
we find in nature, should be of moderate size and elastic. The power
of the flying organs will be increased if they are driven at a comparatively
high speed, and particularly if they are made to
reverse and reciprocate, as in this case they will practically
create the currents upon which they are destined to rise and
advance. The angles made by the kite-like surfaces with the
horizon should vary according to circumstances. They should
be small when the speed is high, and vice versa. This, as stated,
is true of natural wings. It should also be true of artificial wings
and their analogues.

Artificial Flight.&mdash;We are now in a position to enter upon a
consideration of artificial wings and wing movements, and of
artificial flight and flying machines.

We begin with artificial wings. The first properly authenticated
account of an artificial wing was given by G.A. Borelli
in 1670. This author, distinguished alike as a physiologist,
mathematician and mechanician, describes and figures a bird
with artificial wings, each of which consists of a rigid rod in front
and flexible feathers behind. The wings are represented as striking
vertically downwards, as the annexed duplicate of Borelli&rsquo;s figure
shows (fig. 31).



Fig. 31.

     wing, consisting of a rigid rod.

     wing, consisting of flexible
     feathers.
b c, Anterior; and
f,   Posterior margins of the left
     wing same as the right.

r g, d h, Vertical direction of the
    down stroke of the wing.

Borelli was of opinion that flight resulted from the application
of an inclined plane, which beats the air, and which has a wedge
511
action. He, in fact, endeavours to prove that a bird wedges
itself forward upon the air by the perpendicular vibration of its
wings, the wings during their action forming a wedge, the base of
which (c b e) is directed towards
the head of the bird,
the apex (a f) being directed
towards the tail (d). In the
196th proposition of his work
(De motu animalium, Leiden,
1685) he states that&mdash;


&ldquo;If the expanded wings of a
bird suspended in the air shall
strike the undisturbed air beneath
it with a motion perpendicular
to the horizon, the bird
will fly with a transverse motion
in a plane parallel with the
horizon.&rdquo; &ldquo;If,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;the
wings of the bird be expanded,
and the under surfaces of the
wings be struck by the air
ascending perpendicularly to the
horizon with such a force as
shall prevent the bird gliding
downwards (i.e. with a tendency
to glide downwards) from
falling, it will be urged in a
horizontal direction.&rdquo;

The same argument is restated
in different words as under:&mdash;&ldquo;If the air under the wings be
struck by the flexible portions of the wings (flabella, literally fly
flaps or small fans) with a motion perpendicular to the horizon, the
sails (vela) and flexible portions of the wings (flabella) will yield in
an upward direction and form a wedge, the point of which is
directed towards the tail. Whether, therefore, the air strikes the
wings from below, or the wings strike the air from above, the result
is the same,&mdash;the posterior or flexible margins of the wings yield
in an upward direction, and in so doing urge the bird in a horizontal
direction.&rdquo;


There are three points in Borelli&rsquo;s argument to which it is
necessary to draw attention: (1) the direction of the down
stroke: it is stated to be vertically downwards; (2) the construction
of the anterior margin of the wing: it is stated to consist
of a rigid rod; (3) the function delegated to the posterior margin
of the wing: it is said to yield in an upward direction during the
down stroke.

With regard to the first point. It is incorrect to say the wing
strikes vertically downwards, for, as already explained, the body
of a flying bird is a body in motion; but as a body in motion
tends to fall downwards and forwards, the wing must strike
downwards and forwards in order effectually to prevent its fall.
Moreover, in point of fact, all natural wings, and all artificial
wings constructed on the natural type, invariably strike downwards
and forwards.

With regard to the second point, viz. the supposed rigidity
of the anterior margin of the wing, it is only necessary to examine
the anterior margins of natural wings to be convinced that they
are in every case flexible and elastic. Similar remarks apply to
properly constructed artificial wings. If the anterior margins of
natural and artificial wings were rigid, it would be impossible
to make them vibrate smoothly and continuously. This is a
matter of experiment. If a rigid rod, or a wing with a rigid
anterior margin, be made to vibrate, the vibration is characterized
by an unequal jerky motion, at the end of the down and up
strokes, which contrasts strangely with the smooth, steady
fanning movement peculiar to natural wings.

As to the third point, viz. the upward bending of the posterior
margin of the wing during the down stroke, it is necessary to
remark that the statement is true if it means a slight upward
bending, but that it is untrue if it means an extensive upward
bending.

Borelli does not state the amount of upward bending, but one
of his followers, E.J. Marey, maintains that during the down
stroke the wing yields until its under surface makes a backward
angle with the horizon of 45Â°. Marey further states that during
the up stroke the wing yields to a corresponding extent in an
opposite direction&mdash;the posterior margin of the wing, according
to him, passing through an angle of 90Â°, plus or minus according
to circumstances, every time the wing rises and falls.

That the posterior margin of the wing yields to a slight extent
during both the down and up strokes will readily be admitted,
alike because of the very delicate and highly elastic properties
of the posterior margins of the wing, and because of the comparatively
great force employed in its propulsion; but that it
does not yield to the extent stated by Marey is a matter of
absolute certainty. This admits of direct proof. If any one
watches the horizontal or upward flight of a large bird he will
observe that the posterior or flexible margin of the wing never
rises during the down stroke to a perceptible extent, so that the
under surface of the wing, as a whole, never looks backwards.
On the contrary, he will perceive that the under surface of the
wing (during the down stroke) invariably looks forwards and
forms a true kite with the horizon, the angles made by the kite
varying at every part of the down stroke, as shown more
particularly at c d e f g, i j k l m of fig. 30.

The authors who have adopted Borelli&rsquo;s plan of artificial wing,
and who have endorsed his mechanical views of the wing&rsquo;s action
most fully, are J. Chabrier, H.E.G. Strauss-DÃ¼rckheim and
Marey. Borelli&rsquo;s artificial wing, it will be remembered, consists
of a rigid rod in front and a flexible sail behind. It is also made
to strike vertically downwards. According to Chabrier, the wing
has only one period of activity. He believes that if the wing be
suddenly lowered by the depressor muscles, it is elevated solely
by the reaction of the air. There is one unanswerable objection
to this theory: the birds and bats, and some if not all the insects,
have distinct elevator muscles, and can elevate their wings at
pleasure when not flying and when, consequently, the reaction
of the air is not elicited. Strauss-DÃ¼rckheim agrees with Borelli
both as to the natural and the artificial wing. He is of opinion
that the insect abstracts from the air by means of the inclined
plane a component force (composant) which it employs to support
and direct itself. In his theology of nature he describes a schematic
wing as consisting of a rigid ribbing in front, and a flexible
sail behind. A membrane so constructed will, according to him,
be fit for flight. It will suffice if such a sail elevates and lowers
itself successively. It will of its own accord dispose itself as an
inclined plane, and receiving obliquely the reaction of the air,
it transfers into tractile force a part of the vertical impulsion it
has received. These two parts of the wing, moreover, are equally
indispensable to each other.

Marey repeats Borelli and DÃ¼rckheim with very trifling
modifications, so late as 1869. He describes two artificial wings,
the one composed of a rigid rod and sail&mdash;the rod representing
the stiff anterior margin of the wing; the sail, which is made of
paper bordered with cardboard, the flexible posterior margin.
The other wing consists of a rigid nervure in front and behind of
thin parchment which supports fine rods of steel. He states that
if the wing only elevates and depresses itself, &ldquo;the resistance of
the air is sufficient to produce all the other movements. In
effect (according to Marey) the wing of an insect has not the power
of equal resistance in every part. On the anterior margin the
extended nervures make it rigid, while behind it is fine and
flexible. During the vigorous depression of the wing, the nervure
has the power of remaining rigid, whereas the flexible portion,
being pushed in an upward direction on account of the resistance
it experiences from the air, assumes an oblique position which
causes the upper surface of the wing to look forwards.&rdquo; The
reverse of this, in Marey&rsquo;s opinion, takes place during the elevation
of the wing&mdash;the resistance of the air from above causing
the upper surface of the wing to look backwards.... &ldquo;At first,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;the plane of the wing is parallel with the body of the
animal. It lowers itself&mdash;the front part of the wing strongly
resists, the sail which follows it being flexible yields. Carried by
the ribbing (the anterior margin of the wing) which lowers itself,
the sail or posterior margin of the wing being raised meanwhile
by the air, which sets it straight again, the sail will take an intermediate
position and incline itself about 45Â° plus or minus according
to circumstances.... The wing continues its movements
of depression inclined to the horizon; but the impulse of the air,
512
which continues its effect, and naturally acts upon the surface
which it strikes, has the power of resolving itself into two forces,
a vertical and a horizontal force; the first suffices to raise the
animal, the second to move it along.&rdquo;13 Marey, it will be
observed, reproduces Borelli&rsquo;s artificial wing, and even his text,
at a distance of nearly two centuries.

The artificial wing recommended by Pettigrew is a more exact
imitation of nature than either of the foregoing. It is of a more
or less triangular form, thick at the root and anterior margin,
and thin at the tip and posterior margin. No part of it is rigid.
It is, on the contrary, highly elastic and flexible throughout.
It is furnished with springs at its root to contribute to its continued
play, and is applied to the air by a direct piston action
in such a way that it descends in a downward and forward
direction during the down stroke, and ascends in an upward and
forward direction during the up stroke. It elevates and propels
both when it rises and falls. It, moreover, twists and untwists
during its action and describes figure-of-8 and waved tracks in
space, precisely as the natural wing does. The twisting is most
marked at the tip and posterior margin, particularly that half of
the posterior margin next the tip. The wing when in action may
be divided into two portions by a line running diagonally between
the tip of the wing anteriorly and the root of the wing posteriorly.
The tip and posterior parts of the wing are more active than the
root and anterior parts, from the fact that the tip and posterior
parts (the wing is an eccentric) always travel through greater
spaces, in a given time, than the root and anterior parts.

stretching of the

bands contributes to the
continuous play of the wing,
by preventing dead points
at the end of the down and
up strokes. The wing is
free to move in a vertical
and horizontal direction
and at any degree of
obliquity.

The wing is so constructed that the posterior margin yields
freely in a downward direction during the up stroke, while it
yields comparatively little in an upward direction during the
down stroke; and this is a distinguishing feature, as the wing
is thus made to fold and elude the air more or less completely
during the up stroke, whereas it is made to expand and seize
the air with avidity during the down stroke. The oblique line
referred to as running diagonally across the wing virtually divides
the wing into an active and a passive part, the former elevating
and propelling, the latter sustaining.

It is not possible to determine with exactitude the precise
function discharged by each part of the wing, but experiment
tends to show that the tip of the wing elevates, the posterior
margin propels, and the root sustains.

The wing&mdash;and this is important&mdash;is driven by a direct piston
action with an irregular hammer-like movement, the pinion
having communicated to it a smart click at the beginning of
every down stroke&mdash;the up stroke being more uniform. The
following is the arrangement (fig. 32). If the artificial wing here
represented (fig. 32) be compared with the natural wing as
depicted at fig. 33, it will be seen that there is nothing in the one
which is not virtually reproduced in the other. In addition to
the foregoing, Pettigrew recommended a double elastic wing to
be applied to the air like a steam-hammer, by being fixed to the
head of the piston. This wing, like the single wing described,
twists and untwists as it rises and falls, and possesses all the
characteristics of the natural wing (fig. 34).

During the up stroke of the piston the wing is very decidedly convex
on its upper surface (a b c d, A A&prime;); its under surface (e f g h, A A&prime;)
being deeply concave and inclined obliquely upwards and forwards.
It thus evades, to a considerable extent, the air during the up stroke.
During the down stroke of the piston the wing is flattened out in every
direction, and its extremities twisted in such a manner as to form
two screws, as seen at a&prime; b&prime; c&prime; d&prime;, e&prime; f&prime; g&prime; h&prime;, B, B&prime;. The active area of
the wing is by this arrangement considerably diminished during

during the up stroke. i, j, k, elastic band to regulate the expansion

He also recommends an elastic aerial screw consisting of two
blades, which taper and become thinner towards the tips and
posterior margins. When the screw is made to rotate, the blades,
because of their elasticity, assume a great variety of angles, the
angles being least where the speed of the blades is greatest and
vice versa. The pitch of the blades is thus regulated by the
speed attained (fig. 35).

The peculiarity of Pettigrew&rsquo;s wings and screws consists in
their elasticity, their twisting action, and their great comparative
length and narrowness. They offer little resistance to the air
when they are at rest, and when in motion the speed with which
they are driven is such as to ensure that the comparatively
large spaces through which they travel shall practically be
converted into solid bases of support.

After Pettigrew enunciated his views (1867) as to the screw
configuration and elastic properties of natural wings, and more
especially after his introduction of spiral, elastic artificial wings,
and elastic screws, a great revolution took place in the construction
of flying models. Elastic aeroplanes were advocated by
513
D.S. Brown,14 elastic aerial screws by J. Armour,15 and elastic
aeroplanes, wings and screws by Alphonse PÃ©naud.16

PÃ©naud&rsquo;s experiments are alike interesting and instructive.
He constructed models to fly by three different methods:&mdash;(a)
by means of screws acting vertically upwards; (b) by aeroplanes
propelled horizontally by screws; and (c) by wings which
flapped in an upward and downward direction. An account of
his helicoptÃ¨re or screw model appeared in the Aeronaut for
January 1872, but before giving a description of it, it may be well
to state very briefly what is known regarding the history of the
screw as applied to the air.



Fig. 36.&mdash;Cayley&rsquo;s Flying Model.

The first suggestion on this subject was given by A.J.P.
Paucton in 1768. This author, in his treatise on the ThÃ©orie
de la vis d&rsquo;ArchimÃ¨de, describes a machine provided with two
screws which he calls a &ldquo;ptÃ©rophores.&rdquo; In 1796 Sir George
Cayley gave a practical illustration of the efficacy of the screw
as applied to the air by constructing a small machine, consisting
of two screws made of quill feathers, a representation of which
we annex (fig. 36). Sir George writes as under:&mdash;


&ldquo;As it may be an amusement to some of your readers to see a
machine rise in the air by mechanical means, I will conclude my
present communication by describing an instrument of this kind,
which any one can construct at the expense of ten minutes&rsquo; labour.

&ldquo;a and b, fig. 36, are two corks, into each of which are inserted
four wing feathers from any bird, so as to be slightly inclined like
the sails of a windmill, but in opposite directions in each set. A
round shaft is fixed in the cork a, which ends in a sharp point. At
the upper part of the cork b is fixed a whalebone bow, having a small
pivot hole in its centre to receive the point of the shaft. The bow is
then to be strung equally on each side to the upper portion of the
shaft, and the little machine is completed. Wind up the string by
turning the flyers different ways, so that the spring of the bow may
unwind them with their anterior edges ascending; then place the
cork with the bow attached to it upon a table, and with a finger on
the upper cork press strong enough to prevent the string from unwinding,
and, taking it away suddenly, the instrument will rise to the
ceiling.&rdquo;


Cayley&rsquo;s screws were peculiar, inasmuch as they were superimposed
and rotated in opposite directions. He estimated that
if the area of the screws was increased to 200 sq. ft., and
moved by a man, they would elevate him. His interesting
experiment is described at length, and the apparatus figured
in Nicolson&rsquo;s Journal, 1809, p. 172.

Other experimenters, such as J. Degen in 1816 and Ottoris
Sarti in 1823, followed Cayley at moderate intervals, constructing
flying models on the vertical screw principle. In 1842 W.H.
Phillips succeeded, it is stated, in elevating a steam model by
the aid of revolving fans, which according to his account flew
across two fields after having attained a great altitude; and in
1859 H. Bright took out a patent for a machine to be sustained
by vertical screws. In 1863 the subject of aviation by vertical
screws received a fresh impulse from the experiments of Gustave
de Ponton d&rsquo;AmÃ©court, G. de la Landelle, and A. Nadar, who
exhibited models driven by clock-work springs, which ascended
with graduated weights a distance of from 10 to 12 ft. These
models were so fragile that they usually broke in coming in contact
with the ground in their descent. Their flight, moreover, was
unsatisfactory, from the fact that it only lasted a few seconds.



Fig. 37.&mdash;De la Landelle&rsquo;s Flying-machine. m, n, o, p; q, r, s, t,
Screws arranged on vertical axes to act vertically upwards. The
vertical axes are surmounted by two parachutes, and the body of the
machine is furnished with an engine, propeller, rudders and an extensive
aeroplane.

Stimulated by the success of his spring models, Ponton
d&rsquo;AmÃ©court had a small steam model constructed. This model,
which was shown at the exhibition of the Aeronautical Society
of Great Britain at the Crystal Palace in 1868, consisted of two
superposed screws propelled by an engine, the steam for which
was generated (for lightness) in an aluminium boiler. This
steam model proved a failure, inasmuch as it only lifted a third
of its own weight. Fig. 37 embodies de la Landelle&rsquo;s ideas.

514

All the models referred to (Cayley&rsquo;s excepted17) were provided
with rigid screws. In 1872 PÃ©naud discarded the rigid screws
in favour of elastic ones, as Pettigrew had done some years before.



Fig. 38.&mdash;HÃ©licoptÃ¨re or Screw-Model, by PÃ©naud.

PÃ©naud also substituted india-rubber under torsion for the
whalebone and clock springs of the smaller models, and the steam
of the larger ones. His hÃ©licoptÃ¨re or screw-model is remarkable
for its lightness, simplicity and power. The accompanying
sketch will serve to illustrate its construction (fig. 38). It consists
of two superposed elastic screws (a a, b b), the upper of which
(a a) is fixed in a vertical frame (c), which is pivoted in the central
part (d) of the under screw. From the centre of the under
screw an axle provided with a hook (e), which performs the part
of a crank, projects in an upward direction. Between the hook
or crank (e) and the centre of the upper screw (a a), the india-rubber
in a state of torsion (f) extends. By fixing the lower
screw and turning the upper one a sufficient number of times
the requisite degree of torsion and power is obtained. The
apparatus when liberated flies into the air sometimes to a height
of 50 ft., and gyrates in large circles for a period varying from
15 to 30 seconds.

PÃ©naud next directed his attention to the construction of a
model, to be propelled by a screw and sustained by an elastic
aeroplane extending horizontally. Sir George Cayley proposed
such a machine in 1810, and W.S. Henson constructed and
patented a similar machine in 1842. Several inventors succeeded
in making models fly by the aid of aeroplanes and screws, as,
e.g. J. Stringfellow in 1847,18 and F. du Temple in 1857. These
models flew in a haphazard sort of a way, it being found exceedingly
difficult to confer on them the necessary degree of stability
fore and aft and laterally. PÃ©naud succeeded in overcoming
the difficulty in question by the invention of what he designated
an automatic rudder. This consisted of a small elastic aeroplane
placed aft or behind the principal aeroplane which is also elastic.
The two elastic aeroplanes extended horizontally and made a
slight upward angle with the horizon, the angle made by the
smaller aeroplane (the rudder) being slightly in excess of that
made by the larger. The motive power was india-rubber in the
condition of torsion; the propeller, a screw. The reader will
understand the arrangement by a reference to the accompanying
drawing (fig. 39).

Models on the aeroplane screw type may be propelled by two
screws, one fore and one aft, rotating in opposite directions;
and in the event of only one screw being employed it may be
placed in front of or behind the aeroplane.

When such a model is wound up and let go it descends about
2 ft., after which, having acquired initial velocity, it rises and
flies in a forward direction at a height of from 8 to 10 ft. from
the ground for a distance of from 120 to 130 ft. It flies this
distance in from 10 to 11 seconds, its mean speed being something
like 12 ft. per second. From experiments made with this model,
PÃ©naud calculates that one horse-power would elevate and
support 85 &#8468;

D.S. Brown also wrote (1874) in support of elastic aero-biplanes.
His experiments proved that two elastic aeroplanes
united by a central shaft or shafts, and separated by a wide
interval, always produce increased stability. The production
of flight by the vertical flapping of wings is in some respects
the most difficult, but this also has been attempted and achieved.
PÃ©naud and A.H. de Villeneuve each constructed winged
models. Marey was not so fortunate. He endeavoured to
construct an artificial insect on the plan advocated by Borelli,
Strauss-DÃ¼rckheim and Chabrier, but signally failed, his insect
never having been able to lift more than a third of its own
weight.

the crank and the roots of
the wings.
h, Tail of artificial bird.

De Villeneuve and PÃ©naud constructed their winged models
on different types, the former selecting the bat, the latter the bird.
De Villeneuve made the wings of his artificial bat conical in
shape and comparatively rigid. He controlled the movements
of the wings, and made them strike downwards and forwards
in imitation of natural wings. His model possessed great power
of rising. It elevated itself from the ground with ease, and flew
in a horizontal direction for a distance of 24 ft., and at a velocity
of 20 m. an hour. PÃ©naud&rsquo;s model differed from de Villeneuve&rsquo;s
in being provided with elastic wings, the posterior margins
of which in addition to being elastic were free to move round the
515
anterior margins as round axes (see fig. 24). India-rubber
springs were made to extend between the inner posterior parts
of the wings and the frame, corresponding to the backbone of
the bird.

A vertical movement having been communicated by means
of india-rubber in a state of torsion to the roots of the wings,
the wings themselves, in virtue of their elasticity, and because
of the resistance experienced from the air, twisted and untwisted
and formed reciprocating screws, precisely analogous to those
originally described and figured by Pettigrew in 1867. PÃ©naud&rsquo;s
arrangement is shown in fig. 40.

If the left wing of PÃ©naud&rsquo;s model (a b, c d of fig. 40) be compared
with the wing of the bat (fig. 18), or with Pettigrew&rsquo;s
artificial wing (fig. 32), the identity of principle and application
is at once apparent.

In PÃ©naud&rsquo;s artificial bird the equilibrium is secured by the
addition of a tail. The model cannot raise itself from the ground,
but on being liberated from the hand it descends 2 ft. or so, when,
having acquired initial velocity, it flies horizontally for a distance
of 50 or more feet, and rises as it flies from 7 to 9 ft. The following
are the measurements of the model in question:&mdash;length of wing
from tip to tip, 32 in.; weight of wing, tail, frame, india-rubber,
&amp;c., 73 grammes (about 2Â½ ounces).
(J. B. P.)

Flying Machines.&mdash;Henson&rsquo;s flying machine, designed in
1843, was the earliest attempt at aviation on a great scale.
Henson was one of the first to combine aerial screws with extensive
supporting structures occupying a nearly horizontal position.
The accompanying illustration explains the combination (fig. 41).



Fig. 41.&mdash;Henson&rsquo;s Aerostat.


&ldquo;The chief feature of the invention was the very great expanse
of its sustaining planes, which were larger in proportion to the weight
it had to carry than those of many birds. The machine advanced
with its front edge a little raised, the effect of which was to present
its under surface to the air over which it passed, the resistance of
which, acting upon it like a strong wind on the sails of a windmill,
prevented the descent of the machine and its burden. The sustaining
of the whole, therefore, depended upon the speed at which it travelled
through the air, and the angle at which its under surface impinged
on the air in its front.... The machine, fully prepared for flight,
was started from the top of an inclined plane, in descending which it
attained a velocity necessary to sustain it in its further progress.
That velocity would be gradually destroyed by the resistance of the
air to the forward flight; it was, therefore, the office of the steam-engine
and the vanes it actuated simply to repair the loss of velocity;
it was made, therefore, only of the power and weight necessary for
that small effect.&rdquo; The editor of Newton&rsquo;s Journal of Arts and
Sciences speaks of it thus:&mdash;&ldquo;The apparatus consists of a car containing
the goods, passengers, engines, fuel, &amp;c., to which a rectangular
frame, made of wood or bamboo cane, and covered with canvas
or oiled silk, is attached. This frame extends on either side of the car
in a similar manner to the outstretched wings of a bird; but with this
difference, that the frame is immovable. Behind the wings are two
vertical fan wheels, furnished with oblique vanes, which are intended
to propel the apparatus through the air. The rainbow-like circular
wheels are the propellers, answering to the wheels of a steamboat,
and acting upon the air after the manner of a windmill. These wheels
receive motions from bands and pulleys from a steam or other engine
contained in the car. To an axis at the stern of the car a triangular
frame is attached, resembling the tail of a bird, which is also covered
with canvas or oiled silk. This may be expanded or contracted at
pleasure, and is moved up and down for the purpose of causing the
machine to ascend or descend. Beneath the tail is a rudder for directing
the course of the machine to the right or to the left; and to
facilitate the steering a sail is stretched between two masts which rise
from the car. The amount of canvas or oiled silk necessary for buoying
up the machine is stated to be equal to one square foot for each
half pound of weight.&rdquo;


F.H. Wenham, thinking to improve upon Henson, invented
in 1866 what he designated his aeroplanes.19 These were thin,
light, long, narrow structures, arranged above each other in
tiers like so many shelves. They were tied together at a slight
upward angle, and combined strength and lightness. The idea
was to obtain great sustaining area in comparatively small space
with comparative ease of control. It was hoped that when the
aeroplanes were wedged forward in the air by vertical screws,
or by the body to be flown, each aeroplane would rest or float
upon a stratum of undisturbed air, and that practically the
aeroplanes would give the same support as if spread out horizontally.
The accompanying figures illustrate Wenham&rsquo;s views
(figs. 42 and 43).

Fig. 44.&mdash;Stringfellow&rsquo;s Flying Machine.

Stringfellow, who was originally associated with Henson,
and built a successful flying model in 1847, made a second model
in 1868, in which Wenham&rsquo;s aeroplanes were combined with
aerial screws. This model was on view at the exhibition of the
Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, held at the Crystal Palace,
London, in 1868. It was remarkably compact, elegant and
light, and obtained the Â£100 prize of the exhibition for its engine,
which was the lightest and most powerful so far constructed.
The illustration below (fig. 44), drawn from a photograph, gives a
very good idea of the arrangement&mdash;a, b, c representing the
superimposed aeroplanes, d the tail, e, f the screw propellers.
The superimposed aeroplanes (a, b, c) in this machine contained
a sustaining area of 28 sq. ft., in addition to the tail (d). Its engine
represented a third of a horse power, and the weight of the
whole (engine, boiler, water, fuel, superimposed aeroplanes and
516
propellers) was under 12 &#8468; Its sustaining area, if that of the
tail (d) be included, was something like 36 sq. ft., i.e. 3 sq. ft. for
every pound. The model was forced by its propellers along a
wire at a great speed, but so far as an observer could determine,
failed to lift itself, notwithstanding its extreme lightness and
the comparatively very great power employed. Stringfellow,
however, stated that it occasionally left the wire and was sustained
by its aeroplanes alone.

The aerial steamer of Thomas Moy (fig. 45), designed in 1874,
consisted of a light, powerful, skeleton frame resting on three
wheels; a very effective light engine constructed on a new
principle, which dispensed with the old-fashioned, cumbrous
boiler; two long, narrow, horizontal aeroplanes; and two
comparatively very large aerial screws. The idea was to get
up the initial velocity by a preliminary run on the ground. This
accomplished it was hoped that the weight of the machine
would gradually be thrown upon the aeroplanes in the same way
that the weight of certain birds&mdash;the eagle, e.g.&mdash;is thrown upon
the wings after a few hops and leaps. Once in the air the aeroplanes,
it was believed, would become effective in proportion to
the speed attained. The machine, however, did not realize
the high expectations formed of it, and like all its predecessors
it was doomed to failure.



Fig. 45.&mdash;Moy&rsquo;s Aerial Steamer.

Two of the most famous of the next attempts to solve the
problem of artificial flight, by means of aeroplanes, were those
of Prof. S.P. Langley and Sir Hiram S. Maxim, who began
their aerial experiments about the same time (1889-1890). By
1893-1894 both had embodied their views in models and large
flying machines.

Langley, who occupied the position of secretary to the
Smithsonian Institution, Washington, U.S.A., made many small
flying models and one large one. These he designated &ldquo;aerodromes.&rdquo;
They were all constructed on a common principle,
and were provided with extensive flying surfaces in the shape of
rigid aeroplanes inclined at an upward angle to the horizon, and
more or less fixed on the plan advocated by Henson. The
cardinal idea was to force the aeroplanes (slightly elevated at
their anterior margins) forwards, kite-fashion, by means of powerful
vertical screw propellers driven at high speed&mdash;the greater
the horizontal speed provided by the propellers, the greater, by
implication, the lifting capacity of the aerodrome. The bodies,
frames and aeroplanes of the aerodromes were strengthened
by vertical and other supports, to which were attached aluminium
wires to ensure absolute rigidity so far as that was possible.
Langley aimed at great lightness of construction, and in this he
succeeded to a remarkable extent. His aeroplanes were variously
shaped, and were, as a rule, concavo-convex, the convex surface
being directed upwards. He employed a competent staff of
highly trained mechanics at the Smithsonian Institution, and
great secrecy was observed as to his operations. He flew his
smallest models in the great lecture room of the National Museum,
and his larger ones on the Potomac river about 40 m. below
Washington.

While Langley conducted his preliminary experiments in
1889, he did not construct and test his steam-driven flying
models until 1893. These were made largely of steel and
aluminium, and one of them in 1896 made the longest flight
then recorded for a flying machine, namely, fully half a mile
on the Potomac river. The largest aerodrome, intended to carry
passengers and to be available for war purposes, was built to
the order and at the expense of the American government,
which granted a sum of fifty thousand dollars for its construction.



Fig. 46.&mdash;Langley&rsquo;s Flying Machine. a, Large aeroplane;
b, Small aeroplane; c, Propelling screws.


Langley&rsquo;s machine shown in fig. 46 was a working model, not
intended to carry passengers. In configuration the body-portion
closely resembled a mackerel. The backbone was a light but very
rigid tube of aluminium steel, 15 ft. in length, and a little more than
2 in. in diameter. The engines were located in the portion of the
framework corresponding to the head of the fish; they weighed
60 oz. and developed one horse-power. There were four boilers made
of thin hammered copper and weighing a little more than 7 &#8468; each;
these occupied the middle portion of the fish. The fuel used was
refined gasoline, and the extreme end of the tail of the fish was
utilized for a storage tank with a capacity of one quart. There were
twin screw propellers, which could be adjusted to different angles in
practice, to provide for steering, and made 1700 revolutions a minute.
The wings, or aeroplanes, four in number, consisted of light frames
of tubular aluminium steel covered with china silk. The pair in front
were 42 in. wide and 40 ft. from tip to tip. They could be adjusted at
different angles. The machine required to be dropped from a height,
or a preliminary forward impetus had to be given to it, before it could
be started. Fixity of all the parts was secured by a tubular mast
extending upwards and downwards through about the middle of the
craft, and from its extremities ran stays of aluminium wire to the tips
of the aeroplanes and the end of the tubular backbone. By this
trussing arrangement the whole structure was rendered exceedingly
stiff.



Fig. 47.&mdash;Langley&rsquo;s Aerodrome in flight.

In the larger aerodrome (fig. 47) the aeroplanes were concavo-convex,
narrow, greatly elongated and square at their free extremities,
the two propellers, which were comparatively very large, being placed
amidships, so to speak. At the first trial of this machine, on the 7th
of October 1903, just as it left the launching track it was jerked
violently down at the front (being caught, as subsequently appeared,
by the falling ways), and under the full power of its engine was pulled
into the water, carrying with it its engineer. When the aerodrome
rose to the surface, it was found that while the front sustaining
surfaces had been broken by their impact with the water, yet the rear
ones were comparatively uninjured. At the second and last attempt,
on the 8th of December 1903, another disaster, again due to the
launching ways, occurred as the machine was leaving the track. This
time the back part of the machine, in some way still unexplained,
was caught by a portion of the launching car, which caused the rear
sustaining surface to break, leaving the rear entirely without support
517
and it came down almost vertically into the water. Darkness had
come before the engineer, who had been in extreme danger, could aid
in the recovery of the aerodrome. The boat and machine had drifted
apart, and one of the tugs in its zeal to render assistance had fastened
a rope to the frame of the machine in the reverse position from what
it should have been attached, and had broken the frame entirely in
two. Owing to lack of funds further trials were abandoned (see
Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution, 1904, p. 122).



Fig. 48.&mdash;Sir H. Maxim&rsquo;s Flying Machine.

Sir Hiram S. Maxim, like Langley, employed a staff of highly
skilled workmen. His machine (fig. 48) consisted of a platform, on
which stood a large water-tube boiler, a number of concavo-convex
aeroplanes arranged in tiers like shelves, each making a slight upward
angle with the horizon, two very large vertical screws placed aft and
propelled by steam engines, tanks for the storage of water, naphtha,
&amp;c. The boiler was especially noteworthy. The water was contained
in about 2000 bent copper tubes, only 3&frasl;8 in. in external diameter,
heated by over 7000 gas jets arranged in rows. The fuel was naphtha
or gasoline. Steam could be got up in the short space of half a minute.
The steam-generating appliances, which weighed only 1000 &#8468; in
all, were placed in the front of the machine. The motive power was
provided by a pair of two-cylinder, compound engines, poised about
8 ft. from the ground, and about 6 ft. apart. Each of them was independently
governed, and furnished together 363 horse-power in
actual effect, an amount which, considering that their total weight
was only 600 &#8468;, gave the extraordinary efficiency of over 1 horse-power
for every 2 &#8468; weight. The high and the low pressure cylinders
were 5 and 8 in. in diameter respectively, and the stroke was 12 in.
When going at full speed these engines conferred 425 revolutions per
minute on the two gigantic propellers that drove the machine along.
These were in appearance like two-bladed marine propellers except
that they were square instead of rounded at the ends, and were broad
and thin. They were built from overlapping strips of American pine,
planed smooth and covered with glued canvas. They weighed
135 &#8468; each, the length of each blade being close upon 9 ft. and the
width at the ends 5Â½ ft. The pitch was 16 ft. They were carefully
stayed by steel wires to their shafts, or the first revolution would have
snapped them off short. The material of which the framework was
built was thin steel tubing, exceedingly light. All the wires and ties
were of the best steel, capable of standing a strain of 100 tons to the
square inch. The body of the machine was oblong in shape, with the
fore-part cut away like a water-chute boat, and a long counter at the
stern over which the propellers revolved. It had canvas stretched all
over it. High overhead, like a gigantic awning, was the slightly
concavo-convex main aeroplane, tilted towards the front at an
imperceptible angle, and stretched taut. Its area was 1400 sq. ft.,
increased by side wings to 2700 sq. ft. There were also side aeroplanes
arranged in tiers, and large aeroplanes in front, which were pivoted
and served for vertical steering. The machine was strengthened in
every direction by vertical and other supports and securely wired
together at all points. It was furnished with four strong flanged
wheels and ran along a light broad-gauge (9 ft.) railway track,
1800 ft. long, in the hope that when the speed reached a certain
point it would leave the rails, but it was prevented from rising more
than an inch or so by four arms, or outriggers, furnished with wheels,
which projected from its sides and ran under an inverted wooden
upper or safety track outside the railway track proper.

At a trial carried out in 1894 at Bexley, Kent, only the main aeroplane,
the fore and aft rudders, and the top and bottom side planes
were in position. After everything had been got in readiness, careful
observers were stationed along the track, and the machine was connected
to a dynamometer. The engines were then started and the
pump set so as to deliver over 5000 &#8468; of water per hour into the boiler.
The gas was then carefully turned on until the pressure amounted
to 310 &#8468; per sq. in., and the dynamometer showed a thrust of more
than 2100 &#8468; A small safety-valve placed in the steam pipe had
been adjusted so as to blow off slightly at 310 &#8468; and with a strong
blast at 320 &#8468; The signal being given to let go, the machine darted
forward at a terrific pace, and the safety-valve ceased to blow. More
gas was instantly turned on, and before the machine had advanced
300 ft., the steam had mounted to 320 &#8468; per sq. in., and the safety-valve
was blowing off a steady blast. When the machine had
travelled only a few hundred feet, all four of the small outrigger
wheels were fully engaged, which showed that the machine was
lifting at least 8000 &#8468; The speed rapidly increased until when the
machine had run about 900 ft. one of the rear axletrees, which were
of 2 in. steel tubing, doubled up and set the rear end of the machine
completely free. When the machine had travelled about 1000 ft.,
the left-hand forward wheel became disengaged from the safety
track, and shortly after this the right-hand wheel broke the upper
track&mdash;3 in. by 9 in. Georgia pine&mdash;and a plank became entangled
in the framework of the machine. Steam had already been shut off,
and the machine coming to rest fell directly to the ground, all four
of its wheels sinking deeply into the turf without leaving other
marks. Before making this run the wheels which were to engage the
upper track were painted, and the paint left by them on the upper
track indicated the exact point where the machine lifted. The area
of the aeroplanes was very nearly 4000 sq. ft. and the total lifting
effect was fully 10,000 &#8468; The planes therefore lifted 2.5 &#8468; per
sq. ft., and 5 &#8468; for each pound thrust. Nearly half of the power of
the engines was lost in the screw slip. This showed that the diameter
of the screws was not great enough; it should have been at least 22 ft.


In 1897 M.C. Ader, who had already tested, with indifferent
results, two full-sized flying machines, built a third apparatus
with funds furnished by the French government. This reproduced
the structure of a bird with almost servile imitation, save
that traction was obtained by two screw-propellers. The steam
engine weighed about 7 &#8468; per horse-power, but the equilibrium
of the apparatus was defective.

Largely with the view of studying the problem of maintaining
equilibrium, several experimenters, including Otto Lilienthal,
Percy Pilcher and Octave Chanute, cultivated gliding flight
by means of aeroplanes capable of sustaining a man. They
depended mainly on the utilization of natural air currents, trusting
for stability and balance to movements in their own bodies,
or in portions of their machines which they could control. They
threw themselves from natural or artificial elevations, or, facing
the wind, they ran or were dragged forwards against it until
they got under way and the wind caught hold of their aeroplanes.
To Lilienthal in Germany belongs the double credit of demonstrating
the superiority of arched over flat surfaces, and of
reducing gliding flight to regular practice. He made over 2000
glides safely, using gravity as his motive power, with concave,
batlike wings, in some cases with superposed surfaces (fig. 49).
It was with a machine of the latter type that he was upset by
a sudden gust of wind and killed in 1896. Pilcher in England
improved somewhat on Lilienthal&rsquo;s apparatus, but used the same
general method of restoring the balance, when endangered, by
shifting the weight of the operator&rsquo;s body. He too made several
hundred glides in safety, but finally was thrown over by a gust
of wind and killed in 1899. Chanute in America confined his
endeavours to the production of automatic stability, and made
the surfaces movable instead of the man. He used several
different forms of apparatus, including one with five superposed
pairs of wings and a tail (fig. 50) and another with two continuous
aeroplanes, one above the other (fig. 51). He made over 1000
glides without accident.



Fig. 49.&mdash;Lilienthal&rsquo;s Gliding Machine.

Similar experiments were meanwhile conducted by Wilbur
and Orville Wright of Dayton, Ohio, in whose hands the glider
developed into a successful flying machine. These investigators
began their work in 1900, and at an early stage introduced two
characteristic features&mdash;a horizontal rudder in front for steering
in the vertical plane, and the flexing or bending of the ends of
518
the main supporting aeroplanes as a means of maintaining the
structure in proper balance. Their machines to begin with were
merely gliders, the operator lying upon them in a horizontal,
position, but in 1903 a petrol motor was added, and a flight
lasting 59 seconds was performed. In 1905 they made forty-five
flights, in the longest of which they remained in the air for half
an hour and covered a distance of 24Â½ m. The utmost secrecy,
however, was maintained concerning their experiments, and in
consequence their achievements were regarded at the time with
doubt and suspicion, and it was hardly realized that their success
would reach the point later achieved.

Thanks, however, to the efforts of automobile engineers, great
improvements were now being effected in the petrol engine, and,
although the certainty and trustworthiness of its action still
left something to be desired, it provided the designers of flying
machines with what they had long been looking for&mdash;a motor
very powerful in proportion to its weight. Largely in consequence
of this progress, and partly no doubt owing to the stimulus
given by the activity of builders of dirigible balloons, the construction
of motor-driven aeroplanes began to attract a number
of workers, especially in France. In 1906 A. Santos Dumont,
after a number of successful experiments with dirigible cigar-shaped
gas balloons, completed an aeroplane flying machine.
It consisted of the following parts:&mdash;(a) A system of aeroplanes
arranged like the capital letter T at a certain upward angle to
the horizon and bearing a general resemblance to box kites;
(b) a pair of very light propellers driven at a high speed; and
(c) an exceedingly light and powerful petrol engine. The driver
occupied a position in the centre of the arrangement, which is
shown in fig. 52. The machine was furnished with two wheels
and vertical supports which depended from the anterior parts
of the aeroplanes and supported it when it touched the ground
on either side. With this apparatus he traversed on the 12th
of November 1906 a distance of 220 metres in 21 seconds.



Fig. 52.&mdash;Santos Dumont&rsquo;s Flying Machine.

About a year later Henry Farman made several short flights
on a machine of the biplane type, consisting of two main supporting
surfaces one above the other, with a box-shaped vertical
rudder behind and two small balancing aeroplanes in front.
The engine was an eight-cylinder Antoinette petrol motor,
developing 49 horse-power at 1100 revolutions a minute, and
driving directly a single metal screw propeller. On the 27th of
October 1906 he flew a distance of nearly half a mile at Issy-les-Molineaux,
and on the 13th of January 1908 he made a circular
flight of one kilometre, thereby winning the Deutsch-Archdeacon
prize of Â£2000. In March he remained in the air for 3Â½ minutes,
covering a distance of 1Â¼ m.; but in the following month a rival,
Leon Delagrange, using a machine of the same type and constructed
by the same makers, Messrs Voisin, surpassed this
performance by flying nearly 2Â½ m. in 6Â½ minutes. In July
Farman remained in the air for over 20 minutes; on the 6th of
September Delagrange increased the time to nearly 30 minutes,
and on the 29th of the same month Farman again came in front
with a flight lasting 42 minutes and extending over nearly 24Â½ m.

But the best results were obtained by the Wright brothers&mdash;Orville
Wright in America and Wilbur Wright in France. On
the 9th of September 1908 the former, at Fort Myer, Virginia,
made three notable flights; in the first he remained in the air
57Â½ minutes and in the second 1 hour 3 minutes, while in the third
he took with him a passenger and covered nearly 4 m. in 6 minutes.
Three days later he made a flight of 45 m. in 1 hour 141&frasl;3 minutes,
but on the 17th he had an accident, explained as being due to one
of his propellers coming into contact with a stay, by which his
machine was wrecked, he himself seriously injured, and Lieutenant
Selfridge, who was with him, killed. Four days afterwards
Wilbur Wright at Le Mans in France beat all previous records
with a flight lasting 1 hour 31 minutes 254&frasl;5 seconds, in which he
covered about 56 m.; and subsequently, on the 11th of October,
he made a flight of 1 hour 9 minutes accompanied by a passenger.
On the 31st of December he succeeded in remaining in the air
for 2 hours 20 minutes 23 seconds.

Wilbur Wright&rsquo;s machine (fig. 53), that used by his brother
being essentially the same, consisted of two slightly arched
supporting surfaces, each 12Â½ metres long, arranged parallel
one above the other at a distance of 14&frasl;5 metres apart. As they
were each about 2 metres wide their total area was about 50 sq.
metres. About 3 metres in front of them was arranged a pair
of smaller horizontal aeroplanes, shaped like a long narrow
ellipse, which formed the rudder that effected changes of elevation,
the driver being able by means of a lever to incline them up
or down according as he desired to ascend or descend. The rudder
for lateral steering was placed about 2Â½ metres behind the main
surfaces and was formed of two vertical pivoted aeroplanes.
The lever by which they were turned was connected with the
device by which the ends of the main aeroplanes could be flexed
simultaneously though in opposite directions; i.e. if the ends of
the aeroplanes on one side were bent downwards, those on the
519
other were bent upwards. By the aid of this arrangement the
natural cant of the machine when making a turn could be
checked, if it became excessive. The four-cylinder petrol engine
was placed on the lower aeroplane a little to the right of the
central line, being counterbalanced by the driver (and passenger
if one was carried), who sat a little to the left of the same line.
Making about 1200 revolutions a minute, it developed about 24
horse-power, and was connected by chain gearing to two wooden
propellers, 2Â½ metres in diameter and 3Â½ metres apart, the
speed of which was about 450 revolutions a minute. The whole
machine, with aeronaut, weighed about 1100 &#8468;, the weight of
the motor being reputed to be 200 &#8468;

A feature of the year 1909 was the success obtained with
monoplanes having only a single supporting surface, and it was
on a machine of this type that the Frenchman BlÃ©riot on July
25th flew across the English Channel from Calais to Dover in
31 minutes. Hubert Latham all but performed the same feat on
an Antoinette monoplane. The year saw considerable increases
in the periods for which aviators were able to remain in the air,
and Roger Sommer&rsquo;s flight of nearly 2Â½ hours on August 7th
was surpassed by Henry Farman on November 3rd, when he
covered a distance estimated at 137Â¼ m. in 4 hr. 17 min. 53 sec.
In both these cases biplanes were employed. Successful aviation
meetings were held, among other places, at Reims, Juvisy,
Doncaster and Blackpool; and at Blackpool a daring flight was
made in a wind of 40 m. an hour by Latham. This aviator also
proved the possibility of flying at considerable altitudes by
attaining on December 1st a height of over 1500 ft., but this
record was far surpassed in the following January by L. Paulhan,
who on a biplane rose to a height of 1383 yds. at Los Angeles.
In the course of the year three aviators were killed&mdash;LefÃ¨vbre
and Ferber in September and Fernandez in December; and
four men perished in September by the destruction of the French
airship &ldquo;RÃ©publique,&rdquo; the gas-bag of which was ripped open by
a broken propeller. In January 1910 Delagrange was killed
by the fracture of one of the wings of a monoplane on which
he was flying. On April 27th-28th, 1910, Paulhan successfully
flew from London to Manchester, with only one stop, within
24 hours, for the Daily Mail&rsquo;s Â£10,000 prize.

The progress made by all these experiments at aviation
had naturally created widespread interest, both as a matter of
sport and also as indicating a new departure in the possibilities of
machines of war. And in 1909 the British government appointed
a scientific committee, with Lord Rayleigh as chairman, as a consultative
body for furthering the development of the science in
England.

The table below gives some details, approximately correct,
of the principal experiments made with flying machines up to
1908.

5 The sphygmograph, as its name indicates, is a recording instrument.
It consists of a smoked cylinder revolving by means of clock-work
at a known speed, and a style or pen which inscribes its surface
by scratching or brushing away the lampblack. The movements to
be registered are transferred to the style or pen by one or more levers,
and the pen in turn transfers them to the cylinder, where they appear
as legible tracings. In registering the movements of the wings the
tips and margins of the pinions were, by an ingenious modification,
employed as the styles or pens. By this arrangement the different
parts of the wings were made actually to record their own movements.
As will be seen from this account, the figure-of-8 or wave theory of
stationary and progressive flight has been made the subject of a
rigorous experimentum crucis.

6 This continuity of the down into the up stroke and the converse
is greatly facilitated by the elastic ligaments at the root and in the
substance of the wing. These assist in elevating, and, when necessary,
in flexing and elevating it. They counteract in some measure what
may be regarded as the dead weight of the wing, and are especially
useful in giving it continuous play.

7 &ldquo;The importance of the twisted configuration or screw-like form
cannot be over-estimated. That this shape is intimately associated
with flight is apparent from the fact that the rowing feathers of the
wing of the bird are every one of them distinctly spiral in their
nature; in fact, one entire rowing feather is equivalent&mdash;morphologically
and physiologically&mdash;to one entire insect wing. In the
wing of the martin, where the bones of the pinion are short, and in
some respects rudimentary, the primary and secondary feathers are
greatly developed, and banked up in such a manner that the wing
as a whole presents the same curves as those displayed by the
insect&rsquo;s wing, or by the wing of the eagle, where the bones, muscles
and feathers have attained a maximum development. The conformation
of the wing is such that it presents a waved appearance
in every direction&mdash;the waves running longitudinally, transversely
and obliquely. The greater portion of the wing may consequently
be removed without essentially altering either its form or its functions.
This is proved by making sections in various directions,
and by finding that in some instances as much as two-thirds of the
wing may be lopped off without materially impairing the power of
flight.&rdquo;&mdash;Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin. vol. xxvi. pp. 325, 326.

17 Cayley&rsquo;s screws, as explained, were made of feathers, and consequently
elastic. As, however, no allusion is made in his writings
to the superior advantages possessed by elastic over rigid screws, it is
to be presumed that feathers were employed simply for convenience
and lightness. Pettigrew, there is reason to believe, was the first to
advocate the employment of elastic screws for aerial purposes.

figured further on (fig. 44).

FLINCK, GOVERT (1615-1660), Dutch painter, born at Cleves
in 1615, was apprenticed by his father to a silk mercer, but
having secretly acquired a passion for drawing, was sent to
Leuwarden, where he boarded in the house of Lambert Jacobszon,
a Mennonite, better known as an itinerant preacher than as a
painter. Here Flinck was joined by Jacob Backer, and the
companionship of a youth determined like himself to be an artist
only confirmed his passion for painting. Amongst the neighbours
of Jacobszon at Leuwarden were the sons and relations of
Rombert Ulenburg, whose daughter Saske married Rembrandt
in 1634. Other members of the same family lived at Amsterdam,
cultivating the arts either professionally or as amateurs. The
pupils of Lambert probably gained some knowledge of Rembrandt
by intercourse with the Ulenburgs. Certainly J. von Sandrart,
who visited Holland in 1637, found Flinck acknowledged as
one of Rembrandt&rsquo;s best pupils, and living habitually in the house
of the dealer Hendrik Ulenburg at Amsterdam. For many years
Flinck laboured on the lines of Rembrandt, following that master&rsquo;s
style in all the works which he executed between 1636 and 1648;
then he fell into peculiar mannerisms by imitating the swelling
forms and grand action of Rubens&rsquo;s creations. Finally he sailed
with unfortunate complacency into the Dead Sea of official
and diplomatic painting. Flinck&rsquo;s relations with Cleves became
in time very important. He was introduced to the court of the
Great Elector, Frederick William of Brandenburg, who married
in 1646 Louisa of Orange. He obtained the patronage of John
Maurice of Orange, who was made stadtholder of Cleves in 1649.
In 1652 a citizen of Amsterdam, Flinck married in 1656 an heiress,
daughter of Ver Hoeven, a director of the Dutch East India
Company. He was already well known even then in the patrician
circles over which the burgomasters De Graef and the Echevin
Six presided; he was on terms of intimacy with the poet Vondel
and the treasurer Uitenbogaard. In his house, adorned with
antique casts, costumes, and a noble collection of prints, he often
520
received the stadtholder John Maurice, whose portrait is still
preserved in the work of the learned Barleius.

The earliest of Flinck&rsquo;s authentic pieces is a likeness of a lady,
dated 1636, in the gallery of Brunswick. His first subject picture
is the &ldquo;Blessing of Jacob,&rdquo; in the Amsterdam museum (1638).
Both are thoroughly Rembrandtesque in effect as well as in
vigour of touch and warmth of flesh tints. The four &ldquo;civic
guards&rdquo; of 1642, and &ldquo;the twelve musketeers&rdquo; with their
president in an arm-chair (1648), in the town-hall at Amsterdam,
are fine specimens of composed portrait groups. But the best
of Flinck&rsquo;s productions in this style is the peace of MÃ¼nster in
the museum of Amsterdam, a canvas with 19 life-size figures full
of animation in the faces, &ldquo;radiant with Rembrandtesque
colour,&rdquo; and admirably distributed. Flinck here painted his
own likeness to the left in a doorway. The mannered period of
Flinck is amply illustrated in the &ldquo;Marcus Curius eating Turnips
before the Samnite Envoys,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Solomon receiving Wisdom,&rdquo;
in the palace on the Dam at Amsterdam. Here it is that Flinck
shows most defects, being faulty in arrangement, gaudy in tint,
flat and shallow in execution, and partial to whitened flesh that
looks as if it had been smeared with violet powder and rouge.
The chronology of Flinck&rsquo;s works, so far as they are seen in
public galleries, comprises, in addition to the foregoing, the
&ldquo;Grey Beard&rdquo; of 1639 at Dresden, the &ldquo;Girl&rdquo; of 1641 at the
Louvre, a portrait group of a male and female (1646) at Rotterdam,
a lady (1651) at Berlin. In November 1659 the burgomaster
of Amsterdam contracted with Flinck for 12 canvases to
represent four heroic figures of David and Samson and Marcus
Curius and Horatius Cocles, and scenes from the wars of the
Batavians and Romans. Flinck was unable to finish more than
the sketches. In the same year he received a flattering acknowledgment
from the town council of Cleves on the completion of a
picture of Solomon which was a counterpart of the composition
at Amsterdam. This and other pictures and portraits, such as
the likenesses of Frederick William of Brandenburg and John
Maurice of Nassau, and the allegory of &ldquo;Louisa of Orange attended
by Victory and Fame&rdquo; and other figures at the cradle of the
first-born son of the elector, have disappeared. Of several
pictures which were painted for the Great Elector, none are
preserved except the &ldquo;Expulsion of Hagar&rdquo; in the Berlin
museum. Flinck died at Amsterdam on the 22nd of February
1660.



FLINDERS, MATTHEW (1774-1814), English navigator,
explorer, and man of science, was born at Donington, near
Boston, in Lincolnshire, on the 16th of March 1774. Matthew
was at first designed to follow his father&rsquo;s profession of surgeon,
but his enthusiasm in favour of a life of adventure impelled him
to enter the royal navy, which he did on the 23rd of October
1789. After a voyage to the Friendly Islands and West Indies,
and after serving in the &ldquo;Bellerophon&rdquo; during Lord Howe&rsquo;s
&ldquo;glorious first of June&rdquo; (1794) off Ushant, Flinders went out
in 1795 as midshipman in the &ldquo;Reliance&rdquo; to New South Wales.
For the next few years he devoted himself to the task of accurately
laying down the outline and bearings of the Australian coast,
and he did his work so thoroughly that he left comparatively
little for his successors to do. With his friend George Bass, the
surgeon of the &ldquo;Reliance,&rdquo; in the year of his arrival he explored
George&rsquo;s river; and, after a voyage to Norfolk Island, again in
March 1796 the two friends in the same boat, the &ldquo;Tom Thumb,&rdquo;
only 8 ft. long, and with only a boy to help them, explored a
stretch of coast to the south of Port Jackson. After a voyage
to the Cape of Good Hope, when he was promoted to a lieutenancy,
Flinders was engaged during February 1798 in a survey of the
Furneaux Islands, lying to the north of Tasmania. His delight
was great when, in September of the same year, he was commissioned
along with Bass, who had already explored the sea
between Tasmania and the south coast to some extent and
inferred that it was a strait, to proceed in the sloop &ldquo;Norfolk&rdquo;
(25 tons) to prove conclusively that Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land was an
island by circumnavigating it. In the same sloop, in the summer
of next year, Flinders made an exploration to the north of Port
Jackson, the object being mainly to survey Glasshouse Bay
(Moreton Bay) and Hervey&rsquo;s Bay. Returning to England he
was appointed to the command of an expedition for the thorough
exploration of the coasts of Terra Australis, as the southern
continent was still called, though Flinders is said to have been
the first to suggest for it the name Australia. On the 18th of
July 1801 the sloop &ldquo;Investigator&rdquo; (334 tons), in which the
expedition sailed, left Spithead, Flinders being furnished with
instructions and with a passport from the French government
to all their officials in the Eastern seas. Among the scientific
staff was Robert Brown, one of the most eminent English
botanists; and among the midshipmen was Flinders&rsquo;s relative,
John Franklin, of Arctic fame. Cape Leeuwin, on the south-west
coast of Australia, was reached on November 6, and King
George&rsquo;s sound on the 9th of December. Flinders sailed round
the Great Bight, examining the islands and indentations on the
east side, noting the nature of the country, the people, products,
&amp;c., and paying special attention to the subject of the variation
of the compass. Spenser and St Vincent Gulfs were discovered
and explored. On the 8th of April 1802, shortly after leaving
Kangaroo Islands, at the mouth of St Vincent Gulf, Flinders
fell in with the French exploring ship, &ldquo;Le GÃ©ographe,&rdquo; under
Captain Nicolas Baudin, in the bay now known as Encounter
Bay. In the narrative of the French expedition published in
1807 (when Flinders was a prisoner in the Mauritius) by M.
Peron, the naturalist to the expedition, much of the land west
of the point of meeting was claimed as having been discovered
by Baudin, and French names were extensively substituted for
the English ones given by Flinders. It was only in 1814, when
Flinders published his own narrative, that the real state of the
case was fully exposed. Flinders continued his examination
of the coast along Bass&rsquo;s Strait, carefully surveying Port Phillip.
Port Jackson was reached on the 9th of May 1802.

After staying at Port Jackson for about a couple of months,
Flinders set out again on the 22nd of July to complete his
circumnavigation of Australia. The Great Barrier Reef was
examined with the greatest care in several places. The north-east
entrance of the Gulf of Carpentaria was reached early in
November; and the next three months were spent in an examination
of the shores of the gulf, and of the islands that skirt them.
An inspection of the &ldquo;Investigator&rdquo; showed that she was in so
leaky a condition that only with the greatest precaution could
the voyage be completed in her. Flinders completed the survey
of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and after touching at the island of
Timor, the &ldquo;Investigator&rdquo; sailed round the west and south of
Australia, and Port Jackson was reached on the 9th of June
1803. Much suffering was endured by nearly all the members
of the expedition: a considerable proportion of the men succumbed
to disease, and their leader was so reduced by scurvy
that his health was greatly impaired.

Flinders determined to proceed home in H.M.S. &ldquo;Porpoise&rdquo;
as a passenger, submit the results of his work to the Admiralty,
and obtain, if possible, another vessel to complete his exploration
of the Australian coast. The &ldquo;Porpoise&rdquo; left Port Jackson on
the 10th of August, accompanied by the H.E.I.C.&rsquo;s ship &ldquo;Bridgewater&rdquo;
(750 tons) and the &ldquo;Cato&rdquo; (450 tons) of London. On the
night of the 17th the &ldquo;Porpoise&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cato&rdquo; suddenly struck
on a coral reef and were rapidly reduced to wrecks. The officers
and men encamped on a small sandbank near, 3 or 4 ft. above
high-water, a considerable quantity of provisions, with many
of the papers and charts, having been saved from the wrecks.
The reef was in about 22Â° 11&prime; S. and 155Â° E., and about 800 m.
from Port Jackson. Flinders returned to Port Jackson in a
six-oared cutter in order to obtain a vessel to rescue the party.
The reef was again reached on the 8th of October, and all the
officers and men having been satisfactorily disposed of, Flinders
on the 11th left for Jones Strait in an unsound schooner of 29
tons, the &ldquo;Cumberland,&rdquo; with ten companions, and a valuable
collection of papers, charts, geological specimens, &amp;c. On the
15th of December he put in at Mauritius, when he discovered
that France and England were at war. The passport he possessed
from the French government was for the &ldquo;Investigator&rdquo;;
still, though he was now on board another ship, his mission was
521
essentially the same, and the work he was on was simply a continuation
of that commenced in the unfortunate vessel. Nevertheless,
on her arrival at Port Louis the &ldquo;Cumberland&rdquo; was
seized by order of the governor-general de Caen. Flinders&rsquo;s
papers were taken possession of, and he found himself virtually
a prisoner. We need not dwell on the sad details of this unjustifiable
captivity, which lasted to June 1810. But there can
be no doubt that the hardships and inactivity Flinders was compelled
to endure for upwards of six years told seriously on his
health, and brought his life to a premature end. He reached
England in October 1810, after an absence of upwards of nine
years. The official red-tapeism of the day barred all promotion
to the unfortunate explorer, who set himself to prepare an
account of his explorations, though unfortunately an important
part of his record had been retained by de Caen. The results of
his labours were published in two large quarto volumes, entitled
A Voyage to Terra Australis, with a folio volume of maps. The
very day (July 19, 1814) on which his work was published
Flinders died, at the early age of forty. The great work is a
model of its kind, containing as it does not only a narrative of
his own and of previous voyages, but masterly statements of
the scientific results, especially with regard to magnetism,
meteorology, hydrography and navigation. Flinders paid great
attention to the errors of the compass, especially to those caused
by the presence of iron in ships. He is understood to have been
the first to discover the source of such errors (which had scarcely
been noticed before), and after investigating the laws of the
variations, he suggested counter-attractions, an invention for
which Professor Barlow got much credit many years afterwards.
Numerous experiments on ships&rsquo; magnetism were conducted at
Portsmouth by Flinders, by order of the admiralty, in 1812.
Besides the Voyage, Flinders wrote Observations on the Coast
of Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land, Bass&rsquo;s Strait, &amp;c., and two papers
in the Phil. Trans.&mdash;one on the &ldquo;Magnetic Needle&rdquo; (1805),
and the other, &ldquo;Observations on the Marine Barometer&rdquo;
(1806).

FLINSBERG, a village and watering-place of Germany, in
the Prussian province of Silesia, on the Queis, at the foot of the
Iserkamm, 1450 ft. above the sea, 5 m. W. of Friedeberg, the
terminus station of the railway from Greiffenberg. Pop. (1900)
1957. It contains an Evangelical and a Roman Catholic church,
and has some manufactures of wooden wares. Flinsberg is
celebrated for its chalybeate waters, specific in cases of feminine
disorders, and used both for bathing and drinking. It is also
a climatic health resort of some reputation, and the visitors
number about 8500 annually.

FLINT, AUSTIN (1812-1886), American physician, was born
at Petersham, Massachusetts, on the 20th of October 1812,
and graduated at the medical department of Harvard University
in 1833. From 1847 to 1852 he was professor of the theory and
practice of medicine in Buffalo Medical College, of which he was
one of the founders, and from 1852 to 1856 he filled the same
chair in the university of Louisville. From 1861 to 1886 he was
professor of the principles and practice of medicine and clinical
medicine in Bellevue Hospital Medical College, New York. He
wrote many text-books on medical subjects, among these being
Diseases of the Heart (1859-1870); Principles and Practice of
Medicine (1866); Clinical Medicine (1879); and Physical
Exploration of the Lungs by means of Auscultation and Percussion
(1882). He died in New York on the 13th of March 1886.

His son, Austin Flint, junr., who was born at Northampton,
Massachusetts, on the 28th of March 1836, after studying at
Harvard and at the university of Louisville, graduated at the
Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, in 1857. He then became
professor of physiology at the university of Buffalo (1858) and
subsequently at other centres, his last connexion being with the
Cornell University Medical College (1898-1906). He was better
known as a teacher and writer on physiology than as a practitioner,
and his Text-book of Human Physiology (1876) was
for many years a standard book in American medical colleges.
He also published an extensive Physiology of Man (5 vols., 1866-1874),
Chemical Examination of the Urine in Disease (1870),
Effects of Severe and Protracted Muscular Exercise (1871), Source
of Muscular Power (1878), and Handbook of Physiology (1905).
In 1896 he became a consulting physician to the New York State
Hospital for the Insane.



FLINT, ROBERT (1838-&emsp;&emsp;), Scottish divine and philosopher,
was born near Dumfries and educated at the university of
Glasgow. After a few years of pastoral service, first in Aberdeen
and then at Kilconquhar, Fife, he was appointed professor of
moral philosophy and political economy at St Andrews in 1864.
From 1876 to 1903 he was professor of divinity at Edinburgh.
He contributed a number of articles to the 9th edition of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica. His chief works are Christ&rsquo;s Kingdom
upon Earth (Sermons, 1865); Philosophy of History in Europe
(1874; partly rewritten with reference to France and Switzerland,
1894); Theism and Anti-theistic Theories (2 vols., being the
Baird Lectures for 1876-1877; often reprinted); Socialism
(1894); Sermons and Addresses (1899); Agnosticism (1903).



FLINT, TIMOTHY (1780-1840), American clergyman and
writer, was born in Reading, Massachusetts, on the 11th of July
1780. He graduated at Harvard in 1800, and in 1802 settled as
a Congregational minister in Lunenburg, Mass., where he pursued
scientific studies with interest; and his labours in his chemical
laboratory seemed so strange to the people of that retired region,
that some persons supposed and asserted that he was engaged in
counterfeiting. This, together with political differences, led to
disagreeable complications, which resulted in his resigning his
charge (1814) and becoming a missionary (1815) in the valley of
the Mississippi. He was also for a short period a teacher and a
farmer. His observations on the manners and character of the
settlers of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys were recorded in a
picturesque work called Recollections of the Last Ten Years passed
in the Valley of the Mississippi (1826; reprinted in England
and translated into French), the first account of the western
states which brought to light the real life and character of the
people. The success which this work met with, together with the
failing health of the writer, led him to relinquish his more active
labours for literary pursuits, and, besides editing the Western
Review in Cincinnati from 1825 to 1828 and Knickerbocker&rsquo;s
Magazine (New York) in 1833, he published a number of books,
including Francis Berrian, or the Mexican Patriot (1826), his best
novel; A Condensed Geography and History of the Western States,
or the Mississippi Valley (2 vols., 1828); Arthur Clenning (1828),
a novel; and Indian Wars in the West (1833). His style is vivid,
plain and forcible, and his matter interesting; and his works on
the western states are of great value. He died in Salem, Mass.,
on the 16th of August 1840.



FLINT, a city and the county-seat of Genesee county, Michigan,
U.S.A., on Flint river, 68 m. (by rail) N.W. of Detroit. Pop.
(1890) 9803; (1900) 13,103, of whom 2165 were foreign-born;
(1910, census) 38,550. It is served by the Grand Trunk and
the PÃ¨re Marquette railways, and by an electric line, the
Detroit United railway, connecting with Detroit. The city has a
fine court-house (1904), a federal building (1908), a city hall
(1908) and a public library. The Michigan school for the deaf,
established in 1854, and the Oak Grove hospital (private) for the
treatment of mental and nervous diseases, are here. Flint has
important manufacturing interests, its chief manufactures being
automobiles, wagons, carriages&mdash;Flint is called &ldquo;the vehicle
city,&rdquo;&mdash;flour, woollen goods, iron goods, cigars, beer, and bricks
and tiles; and its grain trade is of considerable importance.
In 1904 the total value of the city&rsquo;s factory product was
$6,177,170, an increase of 31.1% over that of 1900. The settlement
of the place, then called the Grand Traverse of the Flint,
began in 1820, but Flint&rsquo;s growth was very slow until 1831,
when it was platted as a village; it was chartered as a city in
1855.



FLINT, or Flintshire (sÃ®r Gallestr), a county of North Wales,
the smallest in the country, bounded N. by the Irish Sea and the
Dee estuary, N.E. by the Dee, E. by Cheshire, and S.W. by
Denbighshire. Area, 257 sq. m. Included in Flint is the detached
hundred of Maelor, lying 8 m. S.E. of the main part of the county,
522
and shut in by Cheshire on the N. and N.E., by Shropshire
on the S., and by Denbighshire on the W. and N.W. The Clwyd
valley is common to Flint and Denbigh. Those of the Alyn and
Wepre (from Ewloe Castle to the Dee) are fine. The Dee, entering
the county near Overton, divides Maelor from Denbigh on the
W., passes Chester and bounds most of the county on the N.
The Clwyd enters Flint near Bodfary, and joining the Elwy near
Rhuddlan, reaches the Irish Sea near Rhyl. The Alyn enters the
county under Moel Fammau, passes Cilcen and Mold (y Wyddgrug),
runs underground near Hesb-Alyn (Alyn&rsquo;s drying-up),
bends south to Caergwrle, re-enters Denbighshire and joins the
Dee. Llyn Helyg (willow-pool), near Whitford, is the chief lake.


Both for their influence upon the physical features and for their
economic value the carboniferous rocks of Flintshire are the most
important. From Prestatyn on the coast a band of carboniferous
limestone passes close by Holywell and through Caerwen; it forms
the Halkin Mountain east of Halkin, whence it continues past Mold
to beyond the county boundary. The upper portion of this series
is cherty in the north&mdash;the chert is quarried for use in the potteries
of Staffordshire&mdash;but traced southward it passes into sandstones and
grits; above these beds come the Holywell shales, possibly the
equivalent of the Pendleside series of Lancashire and Derbyshire,
while upon them lies the Gwespyr sandstone, which has been thought
to correspond to the Gannister coal measures of Lancashire, but may
be a representative of the Millstone Grit. Farther to the east, the
coal measures, with valuable coals, some oil shale, and with fireclays
and marls which are used for brick and tile-making, extend from
Talacre through Flint, Northop, Hawarden and Broughton to Hope.
The carboniferous rocks appear again through the intervention of a
fault, in the neighbourhood of St Asaph. Silurian strata, mostly of
Wenlock age, lie below the carboniferous limestone on the western
border of the county. Triassic red beds of the Bunter fill the Clwyd
valley and appear again on the coal measures S.E. of Chester. Lead
and zinc ores have been worked in the lower carboniferous rocks in
the north of the county, and caves in the same formation, at Caer
Gwyn and Ffynnon Beuno, have yielded the remains of Pleistocene
mammals along with palaeolithic implements. Much glacial drift
obscures the older rocks on the east and north and in the vale of
Clwyd. Short stretches of blown sand occur on the coast near Rhyl
and Talacre.


The London &amp; North-Western railway follows the coast-line.
Other railways which cross the county are the Great Western,
and the Wrexham, Mold &amp; Connah&rsquo;s Quay, acquired by the
Great Central company. For pasture the vale of Clwyd is well
known. Oats, turnips and swedes are the chief crops. Stock
and dairy farming prospers, native cattle being crossed with
Herefords and Downs, native sheep with Leicesters and Southdowns,
while in the thick mining population a ready market is
found for meat, cheese, butter, &amp;c. The population (81,700 in
1901) nearly doubled in the 19th century, and Flintshire to-day
is one of the most densely populated counties in North Wales.
The area of the ancient county is 164,744 acres, and that of
the administrative county 163,025 acres. The collieries begin at
Llanasa, run through Whitford, Holywell, Flint, Halkin (Halcyn),
Northop, Buckley, Mold and Hawarden (PenarlÃ¢g). At Halkin,
Mold, Holywell, Prestatyn and Talacre lead is raised, and is
sometimes sent to Bagillt, Flint or Chester to be smelted. Zinc,
formerly only worked at Dyserth, has increased in output, and
copper mines also exist, as at Talargoch, together with smelting
works, oil, vitriol, potash and alkali manufactories. Potteries
around Buckley send their produce chiefly to Connah&rsquo;s Quay,
whence a railway crosses the Dee to the Birkenhead (Cheshire)
district. Iron seams are now thin, but limestone quarries yield
building stone, lime for burning and small stone for chemical
works. Fisheries are unproductive and textile manufactures
small.

The county returns one member to parliament. The parliamentary
borough district (returning one member), consists of
Caergwrle, Caerwys, Flint, Holywell, Mold, Overton, St Asaph
and Rhuddlan. In addition, there is a small part of the Chester
parliamentary borough. There is one municipal borough,
Flint (pop. 4625). The other urban districts are: Buckley
(5780), Connah&rsquo;s Quay (3369), Holywell (2652), Mold (4263),
Prestatyn (1261) and Rhyl (8473). Flint is in the North Wales
and Chester circuit, assizes being held at Mold. The Flint
borough has a separate commission of the peace, but no separate
court of quarter sessions. The ancient county, which is in the
dioceses of Chester, Lichfield and St Asaph, contains forty-six
entire ecclesiastical parishes and districts, with parts of eleven
others.

Among sites of antiquarian or historical interest, besides the
fragmentary ruin of Flint Castle, the following may be mentioned:&mdash;Caerwys,
near Flint, still shows traces of Roman occupation.
Bodfary (Bodfari) was traditionally occupied by the Romans.
Moel y gaer (bald hill of the fortress), near Northop, is a remarkably
perfect old British post. Maes y Garmon (perhaps
for Meusydd Garmon, as y, the article, has no significance before
a proper name, and so to be translated, battlefields of Germanus).
A mile from Mold is the reputed scene of une victoire sans larmes,
gagnÃ©e non par les armes, mais par la foi (E.H. Vollet). The
Britons, says the legend, were threatened by the Picts and
Saxons, at whose approach the Alleluia of that Easter (A.D. 430)
was sung. Panic duly seized the invaders, but the victor, St
Germanus, confessor and bishop of Auxerre (A.D. 380-448), had
to return to the charge in 446. He has, under the name Garmon,
a great titular share in British topography. At Bangor Iscoed,
&ldquo;the great high choir in Maelor,&rdquo; was the monastery, destroyed
with over 2000 monks, by Ã†thelfred of Northumberland in 607,
as (by a curious coincidence) its namesake Bangor in Ireland
was sacked by the Danes in the 9th century. Bede says (ii. 2)
that Bangor monastery was in seven sections, with three hundred
(working) monks. The supposed lines of direction of Watt&rsquo;s and
Offa&rsquo;s dykes were: Basingwerk, Halkin, Hope, Alyn valley,
Oswestry (Croes Oswallt, &ldquo;Oswald&rsquo;s cross&rdquo;), for Watt&rsquo;s, and
Prestatyn, Mold, Minera, across the Severn (Hafren, or Sabrina)
for Offa&rsquo;s. Owain Gwynedd (Gwynedd or Venedocia, is North
Wales) defeated Henry II. at Coed Ewloe (where is a tower)
and at Coleshill (Cynsyllt). Near Pant Asa (pant is a bottom)
is the medieval Maen Achwynfan (achwyn, to complain, maen,
stone), and tumuli, menhirs (meini hirion) and inscribed stones
are frequent throughout the county. There is a 14th-century
cross in Newmarket churchyard. Caergwrle Castle seems early
Roman, or even British; but most of the castles in the county
date from the early Edwards.

FLINT, a municipal borough and the county town of the
above; a seaport and contributory parliamentary borough, on
the south of the Dee estuary, 192 m. from London by the London
&amp; North-Western railway. Pop. (1901) 4265. The seat of
great alkali manufactures, it imports chiefly sulphur and other
chemicals, exporting coal, soda, potash, copper, &amp;c. The county
gaol here, as at Haverfordwest, occupied an angle of the castle,
was removed to Mold, and is now Chester Castle (jointly with
Cheshire.)

Flint Castle was built on a lonely rock by the riverside by
Edward I. Here met Edward II. and Piers Gaveston. Edward
III. bestowed its constableship upon the earls of Chester, and
here Richard II. surrendered to Bolingbroke. It was twice
taken, after siege, by the parliamentarians, and finally dismantled
in 1647. There remain a square court (with angle towers),
round tower and drawbridge, all three entrusted to a constable,
appointed by the crown under the Municipal Corporations
Reforms Act. Made a borough by Edward I., Flint was chartered
by Edward III., and by Edward the Black Prince, as earl of
Chester.



FLINT (a word common in Teutonic and Scandinavian
languages, possibly cognate with the Gr. &#960;&#955;&#943;&#957;&#952;&#959;&#962;, a tile), in
petrology, a dark grey or dark brown crypto-crystalline substance
which has an almost vitreous lustre, and when pure appears
structureless to the unaided eye. In the mass it is dark and
opaque, but thin plates or the edges of splinters are pale yellow
and translucent. Its hardness is greater than that of steel, so
that a knife blade leaves a grey metallic streak when drawn
across its surface. Its specific gravity is 2.6 or only a little
less than that of crystalline quartz. It is brittle, and when
hammered readily breaks up into a powder of angular grains.
The fracture is perfectly conchoidal, so that blows with a hammer
detach flakes which have convex, slightly undulating surfaces.
At the point of impact a bulb of percussion, which is a somewhat
523
elevated conical mark, is produced. This serves to distinguish
flints which have been fashioned by human agencies from those
which have been split merely by the action of frost and the
weather. The bulb is evidence of a direct blow, probably
intentionally made, and is a point of some importance to
archaeologists investigating Palaeolithic implements. With
skill and experience a mass of flint can be worked to any simple
shape by well directed strokes, and further trimming can be
effected with pressure by a pointed stone in a direction slightly
across the edge of the weapon. The purest flints have the
most perfect conchoidal fracture, and prehistoric man is known
to have quarried or mined certain bands of flint which were
specially suitable for his purposes.


Silica forms nearly the whole substance of flint; calcite and
dolomite may occur in it in small amounts, and analysis has also
detected minute quantities of volatile ingredients, organic compounds,
&amp;c., to which the dark colour is ascribed by some authorities.
These are dispelled by heat and the flint becomes white and duller
in lustre. Microscopic sections show that flint is very finely crystalline
and consists of quartz or chalcedonic silica; colloidal or amorphous
silica may also be present but cannot form any considerable part
of the rock. Spicules of sponges and fragments of other organisms,
such as molluscs, polyzoa, foraminifera and brachiopods, often occur
in flint, and may be partly or wholly silicified with retention of their
original structure. Nodules of flint when removed from the chalk
which encloses them have a white dull rough surface, and exposure
to the weather produces much the same appearance on broken flints.
At first they acquire a bright and very smooth surface, but this is
subsequently replaced by a dull crust, resembling white or yellowish
porcelain. It has been suggested that this change is due to the removal
of the colloidal silica in solution, leaving behind the fibres
and grains of more crystalline structure. This process must be a
very slow one as, from its chemical composition, flint is a material
of great durability. Its great hardness also enables it to resist
attrition. Hence on beaches and in rivers, such as those of the south-east
of England, flint pebbles exist in vast numbers. Their surfaces
often show minute crescentic or rounded cracks which are the edges
of small conchoidal fractures produced by the impact of one pebble
on another during storms or floods.

Flint occurs primarily as concretions, veins and tabular masses in
the white chalk of such localities as the south of England (see Chalk).
It is generally nodular, and forms rounded or highly irregular masses
which may be several feet in diameter. Although the flint nodules
often lie in bands which closely follow the bedding, they were not
deposited simultaneously with the chalk; very often the flint bands
cut across the beds of the limestone and may traverse them at right
angles. Evidently the flint has accumulated along fissures, such as
bedding planes, joints and other cracks, after the chalk had to some
extent consolidated. The silica was derived from the tests of
radiolaria and the spicular skeletons of sponges. It has passed into
solution, filtered through the porous matrix, and has been again
precipitated when the conditions were suitable. Its formation is
consequently the result of &ldquo;concretionary action.&rdquo; Where the flints
lie the chalk must have been dissolved away; we have in fact a kind
of metasomatic replacement in which a siliceous rock has slowly
replaced a calcareous one. The process has been very gradual and
the organisms of the original chalk often have their outlines preserved
in the flint. Shells may become completely silicified, or may have
their cavities occupied by flint with every detail of the interior of the
shell preserved in the outer surface of the cast. Objects of this kind
are familiar to all collectors of fossils in chalk districts.

Chert is a coarser and less perfectly homogeneous substance of the
same nature and composition as flint. It is grey, black or brown, and
commonly occurs in limestone (e.g. the Carboniferous Limestone) in
the same way as flint occurs in chalk. Some cherts contain tests of
radiolaria, and correspond fairly closely to the siliceous radiolarian
oozes which are gathering at the present day at the bottom of some
of the deepest parts of the oceans. Brownish cherts are found in the
English Greensand; these often contain remains of sponges.


The principal uses to which flint has been put are the fabrication
of weapons in Palaeolithic and Neolithic times. Other
materials have been employed where flint was not available,
e.g. obsidian, chert, chalcedony, agate and quartzite, but to
prehistoric man (see Flint Implements below) flint must have
been of great value and served many of the uses to which steel
is put at the present day. Flint gravels are widely employed
for dressing walks and roads, and for rough-cast work in architecture.
For road-mending flint, though very hard, is not
regarded with favour, as it is brittle and pulverizes readily;
binds badly, yielding a surface which breaks up with heavy
traffic and in bad weather; and its fine sharp-edged chips do
much damage to tires of motors and cycles. Seasoned flints
from the land, having been long exposed to the atmosphere,
are preferred to flints freshly dug from the chalk pits. Formerly
flint and steel were everywhere employed for striking a light;
and gun flints were required for fire-arms. A special industry
in the shaping of gun flints long existed at Brandon in Suffolk.
In 1870 about thirty men were employed. Since then the trade
has become almost extinct as gun flints are in demand only in
semi-savage countries where modern fire-arms are not obtainable.
Powdered flint was formerly used in the manufacture of glass,
and is still one of the ingredients of many of the finer varieties
of pottery.

FLINT IMPLEMENTS AND WEAPONS. The excavation of
these remains of the prehistoric races of the globe in river-drift
gravel-beds has marked a revolution in the study of Man&rsquo;s
history (see Archaeology). Until almost the middle of the 19th
century no suspicion had arisen in the minds of British and
European archaeologists that the momentous results of the
excavations then proceeding in Egypt and Assyria would be
dwarfed by discoveries at home which revolutionized all previous
ideas of Man&rsquo;s antiquity. It was in 1841 that Boucher de Perthes
observed in some sand containing mammalian remains, at
Menchecourt near Abbeville, a flint, roughly worked into a cutting
implement. This &ldquo;find&rdquo; was rapidly followed by others, and
Boucher de Perthes published his first work on the subject,
AntiquitÃ©s celtiques et antÃ©diluviennes: mÃ©moire sur l&rsquo;industrie
primitive et les arts Ã  leur origin (1847), in which he proclaimed
his discovery of human weapons in beds unmistakably belonging
to the age of the Drift. It was not until 1859 that the French
archaeologist convinced the scientific world. An English mission
then visited his collection and testified to the great importance
of his discoveries. The &ldquo;finds&rdquo; at Abbeville were followed
by others in many places in England, and in fact in every
country where siliceous stones which are capable of being flaked
and fashioned into implements are to be found. The implements
occurred in beds of rivers and lakes, in the tumuli and ancient
burial-mounds; on the sites of settlements of prehistoric man in
nearly every land, such as the shell-heaps and lake-dwellings;
but especially embedded in the high-level gravels of England
and France which have been deposited by river-floods and long
left high and dry above the present course of the stream. These
gravels represent the Drift or Palaeolithic period when man
shared Europe with the mammoth and woolly-haired rhinoceros.
The worked flints of this age are, however, unevenly distributed;
for while the river-gravels of south-eastern England yield them
abundantly, none has been found in Scotland or the northern
English counties. On the continent the same partial distribution
is observable: while they occur plentifully in the north-western
area of France, they are not discovered in Sweden, Norway or
Denmark. The association of these flints, fashioned for use by
chipping only, with the bones of animals either extinct or no
longer indigenous, has justified their reference to the earlier
period of the Stone Age, generally called Palaeolithic. Those flint
implements, which show signs of polishing and in many cases
remarkably fine workmanship, and are found in tumuli, peat-bogs
and lake-dwellings mixed with the bones of common domestic
animals, are assigned to the Neolithic or later Stone Age. The
Palaeolithic flints are hammers, flakes, scrapers, implements
worked to a cutting edge at one side, implements which resemble
rude axes, flat ovoid implements worked to an edge all round,
and a great quantity of spear and arrow heads. None of these
is ground or polished. The Neolithic flints, on the other hand,
exhibit more variety of design, are carefully finished, and the
particular use of each weapon can be easily detected. Man has
reached the stage of culture when he could socket a stone into
a wooden handle, and fix a flaked flint as a handled dagger or
knife. The workmanship is superior to that shown in any of the
stone utensils made by savage tribes of historic times. The
manner of making flint implements appears to have been in all
ages much the same. Flint from its mode of fracture is the only
kind of stone which can be chipped or flaked into almost any
shape, and thus forms the principal material of these earliest
weapons. The blows must be carefully aimed or the flakes
524
dislodged will be shattered: a gun-flint maker at Brandon,
Suffolk, stated that it took him two years to acquire the art.


For accounts of the gun-flint manufacture at Brandon, and
detailed descriptions of ancient flint-working, see Sir John Evans,
Ancient Stone Implements (1897), Lord Avebury&rsquo;s Prehistoric Times
(1865, 1900); also Thomas Wilson, &ldquo;Arrow-heads, Spear-heads and
Knives of Prehistoric Times,&rdquo; in Smithsonian Report for 1897; and
W.K. Moorehead, Prehistoric Implements (1900).




FLOAT (in O. Eng. flot and flota, in the verbal form flÃ©otan; the
Teutonic root is flut-, another form of flu-, seen in &ldquo;flow,&rdquo; cf.
&ldquo;fleet&rdquo;; the root is seen in Gr. &#960;&#955;&#941;&#949;&#953;&#957;, to sail, Lat. pluere, to
rain; the Lat. fluere and fluctus, wave, is not connected), the
action of moving on the surface of water, or through the air.
The word is used also of a wave, or the flood of the tide, river,
backwater or stream, and of any object floating in water, as
a mass of ice or weeds; a movable landing-stage, a flat-bottomed
boat, or a raft, or, in fishing, of the cork or quill used to support
a baited line or fishing-net. It is also applied to the hollow or
inflated organ by means of which certain animals, such as the
&ldquo;Portuguese man-of-war,&rdquo; swim, to a hollow metal ball or piece
of whinstone, &amp;c., used to regulate the level of water in a tank or
boiler, and to a piece of ivory in the cistern of a barometer.
&ldquo;Float&rdquo; is also the name of one of the boards of a paddle-wheel
or water-wheel. In a theatrical sense, it is used to denote the
footlights. The word is also applied to something broad, level
and shallow, as a wooden frame attached to a cart or wagon
for the purpose of increasing the carrying capacity; and to a
special kind of low, broad cart for carrying heavy weights, and
to a platform on wheels used for shows in a procession. The term
is applied also to various tools, especially to many kinds of trowels
used in plastering. It is also used of a dock where vessels may
float, as at Bristol, and of the trenches used in &ldquo;floating&rdquo; land.
In geology and mining, loose rock or ore brought down by water
is known as &ldquo;float,&rdquo; and in tin-mining it is applied to a large
trough used for the smelted tin. In weaving the word is used of
the passing of weft threads over part of the warp without being
woven in with it, also of the threads so passed. In the United
States a voter not attached to any particular party and open to
bribery is called a &ldquo;float&rdquo; or &ldquo;floater.&rdquo;



FLOCK. 1. (A word found in Old English and Old Norwegian,
from which come the Danish and Swedish words, and not in
other Teutonic languages), originally a company of people, now
mainly, except in figurative usages, of certain animals when
gathered together for feeding or moving from place to place.
For birds it is chiefly used of geese; and for other animals most
generally of sheep and goats. It is from the particular application
of the word to sheep that &ldquo;flock&rdquo; is used of the Christian
Church in its relation to the &ldquo;Good Shepherd,&rdquo; and also of
a congregation of worshippers in its relation to its spiritual
head.

2. (Probably from the Lat. floccus, but many Teutonic
languages have the same word in various forms), a tuft of wool,
cotton or similar substance. The name &ldquo;flock&rdquo; is given to a
material formed of wool or cotton refuse, or of shreds of old
woollen or cotton rags, torn by a machine known as a &ldquo;devil.&rdquo;
This material is used for stuffing mattresses or pillows, and also
in upholstery. The name is also applied to a special kind of
wall-paper, which has an appearance almost like cloth, or, in
the more expensive kinds, of velvet. It is made by dusting on a
specially prepared adhesive surface finely powdered fibres of
cotton or silk. The word &ldquo;flocculent&rdquo; is used of many substances
which have a fleecy or &ldquo;flock&rdquo;-like appearance, such as a
precipitate of ferric hydrate.



FLODDEN, or Flodden Field, near the village of Branxton,
in Northumberland, England (10 m. N.W. of Wooler), the scene
of a famous battle fought on the 9th of September 1513 between
the English and the Scots. On the 22nd of August a great
Scottish army under King James IV. had crossed the border.
For the moment the earl of Surrey (who in King Henry VIII.&rsquo;s
absence was charged with the defence of the realm) had no
organized force in the north of England, but James wasted much
precious time among the border castles, and when Surrey
appeared at Wooler, with an army equal in strength to his own,
which was now greatly weakened by privations and desertion,
he had not advanced beyond Ford Castle. The English commander
promptly sent in a challenge to a pitched battle, which
the king, in spite of the advice of his most trusted counsellors,
accepted. On the 6th of September, however, he left Ford and
took up a strong position facing south, on Flodden Edge. Surrey&rsquo;s
reproaches for the alleged breach of faith, and a second challenge
to fight on Millfield Plain were this time disregarded. The
English commander, thus foiled, executed a daring and skilful
march round the enemy&rsquo;s flank, and on the 9th drew up for battle
in rear of the hostile army. It is evident that Surrey was confident
of victory, for he placed his own army, not less than the
enemy, in a position where defeat would involve utter ruin.
On his appearance the Scots hastily changed front and took
post on Branxton Hill, facing north. The battle began at 4 P.M.
Surrey&rsquo;s archers and cannon soon gained the upper hand, and the
Scots, unable quietly to endure their losses, rushed to close
quarters. Their left wing drove the English back, but Lord
Dacre&rsquo;s reserve corps restored the fight on this side. In all other
parts of the field, save where James and Surrey were personally
opposed, the English gradually gained ground. The king&rsquo;s
corps was then attacked by Surrey in front, and by Sir Edward
Stanley in flank. As the Scots were forced back, a part of Dacre&rsquo;s
force closed upon the other flank, and finally Dacre himself,
boldly neglecting an almost intact Scottish division in front of
him, charged in upon the rear of King James&rsquo;s corps. Surrounded
and attacked on all sides, this, the remnant of the
invading army, was doomed. The circle of spearmen around
the king grew less and less, and in the end James and a few of his
nobles were alone left standing. Soon they too died, fighting to
the last man. Among the ten thousand Scottish dead were all
the leading men in the kingdom of Scotland, and there was no
family of importance that had not lost a member in this great
disaster. The &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Stone,&rdquo; said to mark the spot where
James was killed, is at some distance from the actual battlefield.
&ldquo;Sybil&rsquo;s Well,&rdquo; in Scott&rsquo;s Marmion, is imaginary.



FLODOARD (894-966), French chronicler, was born at
Epernay, and educated at Reims in the cathedral school which
had been established by Archbishop Fulcon (822-900). As
canon of Reims, and favourite of the archbishops Herivaeus
(d. 922) and Seulfus (d. 925), he occupied while still young an
important position at the archiepiscopal court, but was twice
deprived of his benefices by Heribert, count of Vermandois, on
account of his steady opposition to the election of the count&rsquo;s
infant son to the archbishopric. Upon the final triumph of
Archbishop Artold in 947, Flodoard became for a time his chief
adviser, but withdrew to a monastery in 952, and spent the
remaining years of his life in literary and devotional work. His
history of the cathedral church at Reims (Historia Remensis
Ecclesiae) is one of the most remarkable productions of the 10th
century. Flodoard had been given charge of the episcopal
archives, and constructed his history out of the original texts,
which he generally reproduces in full; the documents for the
period of Hincmar being especially valuable. The Annales
which Flodoard wrote year by year from 919 to 966 are doubly
important, by reason of the author&rsquo;s honesty and the central
position of Reims in European affairs in his time. Flodoard&rsquo;s
poetical works are of hardly less historical interest. The long
poem celebrating the triumph of Christ and His saints was called
forth by the favour shown him by Pope Leo VII., during whose
pontificate he visited Rome, and he devotes fourteen books to
the history of the popes.


Flodoard&rsquo;s works were published in full by J.P. Migne (Patrologia
Latina, vol. 135); a modern edition of the Annales is the one edited
by P. Lauer (Paris, 1906). For bibliography see A. Molinier, Sources
de l&rsquo;histoire de France (No. 932).




FLOE (of uncertain derivation; cf. Norse flo, layer, level
plain), a sheet of floating ice detached from the main body of
polar ice. It is of less extent than the field of &ldquo;pack&rdquo; ice,
which is a compacted mass of greater depth drifting frequently
under the influence of deep currents, while the floating floe is
driven by the wind.

FLOOD, HENRY (1732-1791), Irish statesman, son of Warden
Flood, chief justice of the king&rsquo;s bench in Ireland, was born
in 1732, and was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and afterwards
at Christ Church, Oxford, where he became proficient in
the classics. His father was a man of good birth and fortune,
and he himself married a member of the influential Beresford
family, who brought him a large fortune. In his early years
he was handsome, witty, good-tempered, and a brilliant conversationalist.
His judgment was sound, and he had a natural
gift of eloquence which had been cultivated and developed by
study of classical oratory and the practice of elocution. Flood
therefore possessed every personal advantage when, in 1759,
he entered the Irish parliament as member for Kilkenny in his
twenty-seventh year. There was at that time no party in the
Irish House of Commons that could truly be called national,
and until a few years before there had been none that deserved
even the name of an opposition. The Irish parliament was still
constitutionally subordinate to the English privy council; it
had practically no powers of independent legislation, and none
of controlling the policy of the executive, which was nominated
by the ministers in London (see Grattan, Henry). Though
the great majority of the people were Roman Catholics, no
person of that faith could either enter parliament or exercise the
franchise; the penal code, which made it almost impossible for
a Roman Catholic to hold property, to follow a learned profession,
or even to educate his children, and which in numerous particulars
pressed severely on the Roman Catholics and subjected them to
degrading conditions, was as yet unrepealed, though in practice
largely obsolete; the industry and commerce of Ireland were
throttled by restrictions imposed, in accordance with the
economic theories of the period, in the interest of the rival trade
of Great Britain. Men like Anthony Malone and Hely-Hutchison
fully realized the necessity for far-reaching reforms, and it only
needed the ability and eloquence of Flood in the Irish House of
Commons to raise up an independent party in parliament, and
to create in the country a public opinion with definite intelligible
aims.

The chief objects for which Flood strove were the shortening
of the duration of parliament&mdash;which had then no legal limit
in Ireland except that of the reigning sovereign&rsquo;s life,&mdash;the
reduction of the scandalously heavy pension list, the establishment
of a national militia, and, above all, the complete legislative
independence of the Irish parliament. For some years little
was accomplished; but in 1768 the English ministry, which
had special reasons at the moment for avoiding unpopularity
in Ireland, allowed an octennial bill to pass, which was the first
step towards making the Irish House of Commons in some
measure representative of public opinion. It had become the
practice to allow crown patronage in Ireland to be exercised by
the owners of parliamentary boroughs in return for their undertaking
to manage the House in the government interest. But
during the viceroyalty of Lord Townsend the aristocracy, and
more particularly these &ldquo;undertakers&rdquo; as they were called,
were made to understand that for the future their privileges in
this respect would be curtailed. When, therefore, an opportunity
was taken by the government in 1768 for reasserting the constitutional
subordination of the Irish parliament, these powerful
classes were thrown into temporary alliance with Flood. In the
following year, in accordance with the established procedure,
a money bill was sent over by the privy council in London for
acceptance by the Irish House of Commons. Not only was it
rejected, but contrary to custom a reason for this course was
assigned, namely, that the bill had not originated in the Irish
House. In consequence parliament was peremptorily prorogued,
and a recess of fourteen months was employed by the government
in securing a majority by the most extensive corruption.1 Nevertheless
when parliament met in February 1771 another money
bill was thrown out on the motion of Flood; and the next year
Lord Townsend, the lord lieutenant whose policy had provoked
this conflict, was recalled. The struggle was the occasion of a
publication, famous in its day, called Baratariana, to which
Flood contributed a series of powerful letters after the
manner of Junius, one of his collaborators being Henry
Grattan.

The success which had thus far attended Flood&rsquo;s efforts had
placed him in a position such as no Irish politician had previously
attained. He had, as an eminent historian of Ireland observes,
&ldquo;proved himself beyond all comparison the greatest popular
orator that his country had yet produced, and also a consummate
master of parliamentary tactics. Under parliamentary conditions
that were exceedingly unfavourable, and in an atmosphere
charged with corruption, venality and subserviency, he had
created a party before which ministers had begun to quail, and
had inoculated the Protestant constituencies with a genuine
spirit of liberty and self-reliance.&rdquo;2 Lord Harcourt, who
succeeded Townsend as viceroy, saw that Flood must be conciliated
at any price &ldquo;rather than risk the opposition of so
formidable a leader.&rdquo; Accordingly, in 1775, Flood was offered
and accepted a seat in the privy council and the office of vice-treasurer
with a salary of Â£3500 a year. For this step he has
been severely criticized. The suggestion that he acted corruptly
in the matter is groundless; and although it is true that he lost
influence from the moment he became a minister of the crown,
Flood may reasonably have held that he had a better prospect
of advancing his policy by the leverage of a ministerial position
than by means of any opposition party he could hope to muster
in an unreformed House of Commons.3 The result, however,
was that the leadership of the national party passed from Flood
to Grattan, who entered the Irish parliament in the same session
that Flood became a minister.

Flood continued in office for nearly seven years. During this
long period he necessarily remained silent on the subject of the
independence of the Irish parliament, and had to be content
with advocating minor reforms as occasion offered. He was
thus instrumental in obtaining bounties on the export of Irish
corn to foreign countries and some other trifling commercial
concessions. On the other hand he failed to procure the passing
of a Habeas Corpus bill and a bill for making the judges irremovable,
while his support of Lord North&rsquo;s American policy
still more gravely injured his popularity and reputation. But
an important event in 1778 led indirectly to his recovering to
some extent his former position in the country; this event was
the alliance of France with the revolted American colonies.
Ireland was thereby placed in peril of a French invasion, while
the English government could provide no troops to defend the
island. The celebrated volunteer movement was then set on
foot to meet the emergency; in a few weeks more than 40,000
men, disciplined and equipped, were under arms, officered by
the country gentry, and controlled by the wisdom and patriotism
of Lord Charlemont. This volunteer force, in which Flood was
a colonel, while vigilant for the defence of the island, soon
made itself felt in politics. A Volunteer Convention, formed
with all the regular organization of a representative assembly,
but wielding the power of an army, began menacingly to demand
the removal of the commercial restrictions which were destroying
Irish prosperity. Under this pressure the government gave way;
the whole colonial trade was in 1779 thrown open to Ireland for
the first time, and other concessions were also extorted. Flood,
who had taken an active though not a leading part in this movement,
now at last resigned his office to rejoin his old party. He
found to his chagrin that his former services had been to a great
extent forgotten, and that he was eclipsed by Grattan. When
in a debate on the constitutional question in 1779 Flood complained
of the small consideration shown him in relation to a
subject which he had been the first to agitate, he was reminded
that by the civil law &ldquo;if a man should separate from his wife,
and abandon her for seven years, another might then take her
and give her his protection.&rdquo; But though Flood had lost
control of the movement for independence of the Irish parliament,
the agitation, backed as it now was by the Volunteer Convention
526
and by increasing signs of popular disaffection, led at last in
1782 to the concession of the demand, together with a number
of other important reforms (see Grattan, Henry).

No sooner, however, was this great success gained than a
question arose&mdash;known as the Simple Repeal controversy&mdash;as
to whether England, in addition to the repeal of the Acts on
which the subordination of the Irish parliament had been based,
should not be required expressly to renounce for the future all
claim to control Irish legislation. The chief historical importance
of this dispute is that it led to the memorable rupture of friendship
between Flood and Grattan, each of whom assailed the other with
unmeasured but magnificently eloquent invective in the House of
Commons. Flood&rsquo;s view prevailed&mdash;for a Renunciation Act such
as he advocated was ungrudgingly passed by the English parliament
in 1783&mdash;and for a time he regained popularity at the
expense of his rival. Flood next (28th of November 1783)
introduced a reform bill, after first submitting it to the Volunteer
Convention. The bill, which contained no provision for giving
the franchise to Roman Catholics&mdash;a proposal which Flood
always opposed&mdash;was rejected, ostensibly on the ground that the
attitude of the volunteers threatened the freedom of parliament.
The volunteers were perfectly loyal to the crown and the connexion
with England. They carried an address to the king, moved by
Flood, expressing the hope that their support of parliamentary
reform might be imputed to nothing but &ldquo;a sober and laudable
desire to uphold the constitution ... and to perpetuate the
cordial union of both kingdoms.&rdquo; The convention then dissolved,
though Flood had desired, in opposition to Grattan, to continue
it as a means of putting pressure on parliament for the purpose
of obtaining reform.

In 1776 Flood had made an attempt to enter the English House
of Commons. In 1783 he tried again, this time with success.
He purchased a seat for Winchester from the duke of Chandos,
and for the next seven years he was a member at the same time
of both the English and Irish parliaments. He reintroduced,
but without success, his reform bill in the Irish House in 1784;
supported the movement for protecting Irish industries; but
short-sightedly opposed Pitt&rsquo;s commercial propositions in 1785.
He remained a firm opponent of Roman Catholic emancipation,
even defending the penal laws on the ground that after the
Revolution they &ldquo;were not laws of persecution but of political
necessity&rdquo;; but after 1786 he does not appear to have attended
the parliament in Dublin. In the House at Westminster, where
he refused to enrol himself as a member of either political party,
he was not successful. His first speech, in opposition to Fox&rsquo;s
India Bill on the 3rd of December 1783, disappointed the expectations
aroused by his celebrity. His speech in opposition
to the commercial treaty with France in 1787 was, however,
most able; and in 1790 he introduced a reform bill which Fox
declared to be the best scheme of reform that had yet been
proposed, and which in Burke&rsquo;s opinion retrieved Flood&rsquo;s reputation.
But at the dissolution in the same year he lost his seat in
both parliaments, and he then retired to Farmley, his residence
in county Kilkenny, where he died on the 2nd of December 1791.

When Peter Burrowes, notwithstanding his close personal
friendship with Grattan, declared that Flood was &ldquo;perhaps the
ablest man Ireland ever produced, indisputably the ablest man
of his own times,&rdquo; he expressed what was probably the general
opinion of Flood&rsquo;s contemporaries. Lord Charlemont, who knew
him intimately though not always in agreement with his policy,
pronounced him to be &ldquo;a man of consummate ability.&rdquo; He also
declared that avarice made no part of Flood&rsquo;s character. Lord
Mountmorres, a critic by no means partial to Flood, described
him as a pre-eminently truthful man, and one who detested
flattery. Grattan, who even after the famous quarrel never lost
his respect for Flood, said of him that he was the best tempered and
the most sensible man in the world. In his youth he was genial,
frank, sociable and witty; but in later years disappointment
made him gloomy and taciturn. As an orator he was less polished,
less epigrammatic than Grattan; but a closer reasoner and a
greater master of sarcasm and invective. Personal ambition
often governed his actions, but his political judgment was usually
sound; and it was the opinion of Bentham that Flood would have
succeeded in carrying a reform bill which might have preserved
Irish parliamentary independence, if he had been supported by
Grattan and the rest of his party in keeping alive the Volunteer
Convention in 1783. Though he never wavered in loyalty to the
British crown and empire, Ireland never produced a more sincere
patriot than Henry Flood.

FLOOD (in O. Eng. flÃ³d, a word common to Teutonic languages,
cf. Ger. Flut, Dutch vloed, from the same root as is seen in &ldquo;flow,&rdquo;
&ldquo;float&rdquo;), an overflow of water, an expanse of water submerging
land, a deluge, hence &ldquo;the flood,&rdquo; specifically, the Noachian deluge
of Genesis, but also any other catastrophic submersion recorded
in the mythology of other nations than the Hebrew (see Deluge,
The). In the sense of &ldquo;flowing water,&rdquo; the word is applied to
the inflow of the tide, as opposed to &ldquo;ebb.&rdquo;



FLOOD PLAIN, the term in physical geography for a plain
formed of sediment dropped by a river. When the slope down
which a river runs has become very slight, it is unable to carry
the sediment brought from higher regions nearer its source,
and consequently the lower portion of the river valley becomes
filled with alluvial deposits; and since in times of flood the rush
of water in the high regions tears off and carries down a greater
quantity of sediment than usual, the river spreads this also over
the lower valley where the plain is flooded, because the rush of
water is checked, and the stream in consequence drops its extra
load. These flood plains are sometimes of great extent. That
of the Mississippi below Ohio has a width of from 20 to 80 m.,
and its whole extent has been estimated at 50,000 sq. m. Flood
plains may be the result of planation, with aggradation, that is,
they may be due to a graded river working in meanders from side
to side, widening its valley by this process and covering the
widened valley with sediment. Or the stream by cutting into
another stream (piracy), by cutting through a barrier near its
head waters, by entering a region of looser or softer rock, and by
glacial drainage, may form a flood plain simply by filling up
its valley (alluviation only). Any obstruction across a river&rsquo;s
course, such as a band of hard rock, may form a flood plain behind
it, and indeed anything which checks a river&rsquo;s course and causes
it to drop its load will tend to form a flood plain; but it is most
commonly found near the mouth of a large river, such as the
Rhine, the Nile, or the Mississippi, where there are occasional
floods and the river usually carries a large amount of sediment.
&ldquo;Levees&rdquo; are formed, inside which the river usually flows,
gradually raising its bed above the surrounding plain. Occasional
breaches during floods cause the overloaded stream to spread in
a great lake over the surrounding country, where the silt covers
the ground in consequence. Sections of the Missouri flood plain
made by the United States geological survey show a great variety
of material of varying coarseness, the stream bed being scoured
at one place, and filled at another by currents and floods of varying
swiftness, so that sometimes the deposits are of coarse gravel,
sometimes of fine sand, or of fine silt, and it is probable that any
section of such an alluvial plain would show deposits of a similar
character. The flood plain during its formation is marked by
meandering, or anastomosing streams, ox-bow lakes and bayous,
527
marshes or stagnant pools, and is occasionally completely covered
with water. When the drainage system has ceased to act or is
entirely diverted owing to any cause, the flood plain may become
a level area of great fertility, similar in appearance to the floor of
an old lake. The flood plain differs, however, inasmuch as it is
not altogether flat. It has a gentle slope down-stream, and often
for a distance from the sides towards the centre.



FLOOR (from O. Eng. flor, a word common to many Teutonic
languages, cf. Dutch vloer, and Ger. Flur, a field, in the feminine,
and a floor, masculine), generally the lower horizontal surface of
a room, but specially employed for one covered with boarding
or parquetry. The various levels of rooms in a house are designated
as &ldquo;ground-floor,&rdquo; &ldquo;first-floor,&rdquo; &ldquo;mezzanine-floor,&rdquo; &amp;c.
The principal floor is the storey which contains the chief apartments
whether on the ground- or first-floor; in Italy they are
always on the latter and known as the &ldquo;piano nobile.&rdquo; The
storey below the ground-floor is called the &ldquo;basement-floor,&rdquo;
even if only a little below the level of the pavement outside; the
storey in a roof is known as the &ldquo;attic-floor.&rdquo; The expressions
one pair, two pair, &amp;c., apply to the storeys above the first
flight of stairs from the ground (see also Carpentry).



FLOORCLOTH, a rough flannel cloth used for domestic
cleaning; also a generic term applied to a variety of materials
used in place of carpets for covering floors, and known by such
trade names as kamptulicon, oil-cloth, linoleum, corticine, cork-carpet,
&amp;c. Kamptulicon (&#954;&#945;&#956;&#960;&#964;&#972;&#962;, flexible, &#959;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#962;, thick) was
patented in 1844 by E. Galloway, but did not attract much
attention till about 1862. It was essentially a preparation of
india-rubber masticated up with ground cork, and rolled out
into sheets between heavy steam-heated rollers, sometimes
over a backing of canvas. Owing to its expensiveness, it has
given place to cheaper materials serving the same purpose.
Oil-cloth is a coarse canvas which has received a number of
coats of thick oil paint, each coat being rubbed smooth with
pumice stone before the application of the next. Its surface
is ornamented with patterns printed in oil colours by means of
wooden blocks. Linoleum (linum, flax, oleum, oil), patented by
F. Walton in 1860 and 1863, consists of oxidized linseed oil and
ground cork. These ingredients, thoroughly incorporated with
the addition of certain gummy and resinous matters, and of
pigments such as ochre and oxide of iron as required, are pressed
on to a rough canvas backing between steam-heated rollers.
Patterns may be printed on its surface with oil paint, or by an
improved method may be inlaid with coloured composition
so that the colours are continuous through the thickness of the
linoleum, instead of being on the surface only, and thus do not disappear
with wear. Lincrusta-Walton is a similar material to linoleum,
also having oxidized linseed oil as its base, which is stamped
out in embossed patterns and used as a covering for walls.



FLOQUET, CHARLES THOMAS (1828-1896), French statesman,
was born at St Jean-Pied-de-Port (Basses-PyrÃ©nÃ©es) on
the 2nd of October 1828. He studied law in Paris, and was
called to the bar in 1851. The coup d&rsquo;Ã©tat of that year aroused
the strenuous opposition of Floquet, who had, while yet a student,
given proof of his republican sympathies by taking part in the
fighting of 1848. He made his name by his brilliant and fearless
attacks on the government in a series of political trials, and at
the same time contributed to the Temps and other influential
journals. When the tsar Alexander II. visited the Palais de
Justice in 1867, Floquet was said to have confronted him with
the cry &ldquo;Vive la Pologne, monsieur!&rdquo; He delivered a scathing
indictment of the Empire at the trial of Pierre Bonaparte for
killing Victor Noir in 1870, and took a part in the revolution
of the 4th of September, as well as in the subsequent defence
of Paris. In 1871 he was elected to the National Assembly
by the department of the Seine. During the Commune he formed
the Ligue d&rsquo;union rÃ©publicaine des droits de Paris to attempt a
reconciliation with the government of Versailles. When his
efforts failed, he left Paris, and was imprisoned by order of Thiers,
but soon released. He became editor of the RÃ©publique FranÃ§aise,
was chosen president of the municipal council, and in 1876 was
elected deputy for the eleventh arrondissement. He took a
prominent place among the extreme radicals, and became
president of the group of the &ldquo;Union rÃ©publicaine.&rdquo; In 1882
he held for a short time the post of prefect of the Seine. In
1885 he succeeded M. Brisson as president of the chamber.
This difficult position he filled with such tact and impartiality
that he was re-elected the two following years. Having
approached the Russian ambassador in such a way as to remove
the prejudice existing against him in Russia since the incident
of 1867, he rendered himself eligible for office; and on the fall
of the Tirard cabinet in 1888 he became president of the council
and minister of the interior in a radical ministry, which pledged
itself to the revision of the constitution, but was forced to combat
the proposals of General Boulanger. Heated debates in the
chamber culminated on the 13th of July in a duel between Floquet
and Boulanger in which the latter was wounded. In the following
February the government fell on the question of revision, and
in the new chamber of November Floquet was re-elected to
the presidential chair. The Panama scandals, in which he was
compelled to admit his implication, dealt a fatal blow to his
career: he lost the presidency of the chamber in 1892, and his
seat in the house in 1893, but in 1894 was elected to the senate.
He died in Paris on the 18th of January 1896.

Faivre (1885).




FLOR, ROGER DI, a military adventurer of the 13th-14th
century, was the second son of a falconer in the service of the
emperor Frederick II., who fell at Tagliacozzo (1268), and when
eight years old was sent to sea in a galley belonging to the
Knights Templars. He entered the order and became commander
of a galley. At the siege of Acre by the Saracens in
1291 he was accused and denounced to the pope as a thief and
an apostate, was degraded from his rank, and fled to Genoa,
where he began to play the pirate. The struggle between the
kings of Aragon and the French kings of Naples for the possession
of Sicily was at this time going on; and Roger entered the
service of Frederick, king of Sicily, who gave him the rank of
vice-admiral. At the close of the war, in 1302, as Frederick was
anxious to free the island from his mercenary troops (called
AlmÃºgavares), whom he had no longer the means of paying,
Roger induced them under his leadership to seek new adventures
in the East, in fighting against the Turks, who were ravaging
the empire. The emperor Andronicus II. accepted his offer of
service; and in September 1303 Roger with his fleet and army
arrived at Constantinople. He was adopted into the imperial
family, was married to a grand-daughter of the emperor, and
was made grand duke and commander-in-chief of the army and
the fleet. After some weeks lost in dissipation, intrigues and
bloody quarrels, Roger and his men were sent into Asia, and after
some successful encounters with the Turks they went into winter
quarters at Cyzicus. In May 1304 they again took the field,
and rendered the important service of relieving Philadelphia,
then invested and reduced to extremities by the Turks. But
Roger, bent on advancing his own interests rather than those
of the emperor, determined to found in the East a principality
for himself. He sent his treasures to Magnesia, but the people
slew his Catalans and seized the treasures. He then formed the
siege of the town, but his attacks were repulsed, and he was
compelled to retire. Being recalled to Europe, he settled his
troops in Gallipoli and other towns, and visited Constantinople
to demand pay for the AlmÃºgavares. Dissatisfied with the small
sum granted by the emperor, he plundered the country and
carried on intrigues both with and against the emperor, receiving
reinforcements all the while from all parts of southern Europe.
Roger was now created Caesar, but shortly afterwards the young
emperor Michael Palaeologus, not daring to attack the fierce
and now augmented bands of adventurers, invited Roger to
Adrianople, and there contrived his assassination and the
massacre of his Catalan cavalry (April 4, 1306). His death was
avenged by his men in a fierce and prolonged war against the
Greeks.

Turcos y Griegos (Paris, 1840).

FLORA, in Roman mythology, goddess of spring-time and
flowers, later identified with the Greek Chloris. Her festival
at Rome, the Floralia, instituted 238 B.C. by order of the
Sibylline books and at first held irregularly, became annual
after 173. It lasted six days (April 28-May 3), the first day being
the anniversary of the foundation of her temple. It included
theatrical performances and animal hunts in the circus, and
vegetables were distributed to the people. The proceedings
were characterized by excessive merriment and licentiousness.
According to the legend, her worship was instituted by Titus
Tatius, and her priest, the flamen Floralis, by Numa. In art
Flora was represented as a beautiful maiden, bedecked with
flowers (Ovid, Fasti, v. 183 ff.; Tacitus, Annals, ii. 49).

The term &ldquo;flora&rdquo; is used in botany collectively for the plant-growth
of a district; similarly &ldquo;fauna&rdquo; is used collectively
for the animals.



FLORE AND BLANCHEFLEUR, a 13th-century romance.
This tale, generally supposed to be of oriental origin, relates the
passionate devotion of two children, and their success in overcoming
all the obstacles put in the way of their love. The
romance appears in differing versions in French, English, German,
Swedish, Icelandic, Italian, Spanish, Greek and Hungarian.
The various forms of the tale receive a detailed notice in E.
Hausknecht&rsquo;s version of the 13th-century Middle English poem
of &ldquo;Floris and Blauncheflur&rdquo; (Samml. eng. DenkmÃ¤ler, vol. v.
Berlin, 1885). Nothing definite can be stated of the origin of
the story, but France was in the 12th and 13th centuries the
chief market of romance, and the French version of the tale,
Floire et Blanchefleur, is the most widespread. Floire, the son
of a Saracen king of Spain, is brought up in constant companionship
with Blanchefleur, the daughter of a Christian slave of
noble birth. Floire&rsquo;s parents, hoping to destroy this attachment,
send the boy away at fifteen and sell Blanchefleur to foreign
slave-merchants. When Floire returns a few days later he is
told that his companion is dead, but when he threatens to kill
himself, his parents tell him the truth. He traces her to the
tower of the maidens destined for the harem of the emir of
Babylon, into which he penetrates concealed in a basket of
flowers. The lovers are discovered, but their constancy touches
the hearts of their judges. They are married, and Floire returns
to his kingdom, when he and all his people adopt Christianity.
Of the two 12th-century French poems (ed. Ã‰dÃ©lestand du
MÃ©ril, Paris, 1856), the one contains the love story with few
additions, the other is a romance of chivalry, containing the
usual battles, single combats, &amp;c. Two lyrics based on episodes
of the story are printed by Paulin Paris in his Romancero
franÃ§ais (Paris, 1883). The English poem renders the French
version without amplifications, such as are found in other
adaptations. Its author has less sentiment than his original,
and less taste for detailed description. Among the other forms
of the story must be noted the prose romance (c. 1340) of
Boccaccio, Il Filocolo, and the 14th-century Leggenda della
reina Rosana e di Rosana sua figliuola (pr. Leghorn, 1871). The
similarity between the story of Floire and Blanchefleur and
Chante-fable of Aucassin et Nicolete1 has been repeatedly pointed
out, and they have even been credited with a common
source.

Blanscheflur, ed. E. Sommer (Leipzig, 1846); the Swedish by G.E.
Klemming (Stockholm, 1844). The English poem was also edited
by Hartschorne (English Metrical Tales, 1829), by Laing (Abbotsford
Club, 1829), and by Lumly (Early Eng. Text Soc., 1866, re-edited
G.H. McKnight, 1901). J. Reinhold (Floire et Blanchefleur, Paris,
1906) suggests a parallelism with the story of Cupid and Psyche as
told by Apuleius; also that the oriental setting does not necessarily
imply a connexion with Arab tales, as the circumstances might with
small alteration have been taken from the Vulgate version of the
book of Esther.

FLORENCE, WILLIAM JERMYN (1831-1891), American
actor, of Irish descent, whose real name was Bernard Conlin,
was born on the 26th of July 1831 at Albany, N.Y., and first
attracted attention as an actor at Brougham&rsquo;s Lyceum in 1851.
Two years later he married Mrs Malvina Pray Littell (d. 1906), in
association with whom, until her retirement in 1889, he won all
his successes, notably in Benjamin Woolf&rsquo;s The Mighty Dollar,
said to have been presented more than 2500 times. In 1856
they had a successful London season, Mrs Florence being one of
the first American actresses to appear on the English stage.
In 1889 Florence entered into partnership with Joseph Jefferson,
playing Sir Lucius O&rsquo;Trigger to his Bob Acres and Mrs John
Drew&rsquo;s Mrs Malaprop on a very successful tour. His last
appearance was with Jefferson on the 14th of November 1891,
as Ezekiel Homespun in The Heir-at-law, and he died on the 18th
of November in Philadelphia.



FLORENCE OF WORCESTER (d. 1118), English chronicler,
was a monk of Worcester, who died, as we learn from his continuator,
on the 7th of July 1118. Beyond this fact nothing is
known of his life. He compiled a chronicle called Chronicon
ex chronicis which begins with the creation and ends in 1117.
The basis of his work was a chronicle compiled by Marianus
Scotus, an Irish recluse, who lived first at Fulda, afterwards at
Mainz. Marianus, who began his work after 1069, carried it up
to 1082. Florence supplements Marianus from a lost version
of the English Chronicle, and from Asser. He is always worth
comparing with the extant English Chronicles; and from 1106
he is an independent annalist, dry but accurate. Either Florence
or a later editor of his work made considerable borrowings from
the first four books of Eadmer&rsquo;s Historia novorum. Florence&rsquo;s
work is continued, up to 1141, by a certain John of Worcester,
who wrote about 1150. John is valuable for the latter years
of Henry I. and the early years of Stephen. He is friendly to
Stephen, but not an indiscriminate partisan.


The first edition of these two writers is that of 1592 (by William
Howard). The most accessible is that of B. Thorpe (Eng. Hist. Soc.,
2 vols., 1848-1849); but Thorpe&rsquo;s text of John&rsquo;s continuation needs
revision. Thorpe gives, without explanations, the insertions of an
ill-informed Gloucester monk who has obscured the accurate chronology
of the original. Thorpe also prints a continuation by John
Taxter (died c. 1295), a 13th-century writer and a monk of Bury St
Edmunds. Florence and John of Worcester are translated by J.
Stevenson in his Church Historians of England, vol. ii. pt. i. (London,
1853); T. Forester&rsquo;s translation in Bohn&rsquo;s Antiquarian Library
(London, 1854) gives the work of Taxter also.

FLORENCE, the county-seat of Lauderdale county, Alabama,
U.S.A., on the N. bank of the Tennessee river, at the foot of
Muscle Shoals Canal, and about 560 ft. above sea-level. Pop.
(1880) 1359; (1890) 6012; (1900) 6478 (1952 negroes); (1910)
6689. It is served by the Southern, the Northern Alabama
(controlled by the Southern), and the Louisville &amp; Nashville
railways, and by electric railway to Sheffield and Tuscumbia,
and the Tennessee river is here navigable. Florence is situated
in the fertile agricultural lands of the Tennessee river valley on
the edge of the coal and iron districts of Alabama, and has
various manufactures, including pig-iron, cotton goods, wagons,
stoves, fertilizers, staves and mercantile supplies. At Florence
are the state Normal College, the Florence University for
Women, and the Burrell Normal School (for negroes; founded
in 1903 by the American Missionary Association). Florence
was founded in 1818, Andrew Jackson, afterwards president
of the United States, and ex-president James Madison being
among the early property holders. For several years Florence
and Nashville, Tennessee, were commercial rivals, being situated
respectively at the head of navigation on the Tennessee and
Cumberland rivers. The first invasion of Alabama by Federal
troops in the Civil War was by a gunboat raid up the Tennessee
to Florence on the 8th of February 1862. On the 11th of April
1863 another Federal gunboat raid was attempted, but the vessels
were repulsed by a force under Gen. S.A. Wood. On the 26th
529
of May following, Federal troops entered Florence, and destroyed
cotton mills and public and private property; but they were
driven back by Gen. Philip D. Roddy (1820-1897). On the
11th of December 1863 the town was again raided, but the
Federals did not secure permanent possession. Florence was
chartered as a city in 1889.



FLORENCE (Ital. Firenze, Lat. Florentia), formerly the capital
of Tuscany, now the capital of a province of the kingdom of
Italy, and the sixth largest city in the country. It is situated
43Â° 46&prime; N., 11Â° 14&prime; E., on both banks of the river Arno, which at
this point flows through a broad fertile valley enclosed between
spurs of the Apennines. The city is 165 ft. above sea-level, and
occupies an area of 3 sq. m. (area of the commune, 16Â½ sq. m.).
The geological formation of the soil belongs to the Quaternary
and Pliocene period in its upper strata, and to the Eocene and
Cretaceous in the lower. Pietra forte of the Cretaceous period
is quarried north and south of the city, and has been used for
centuries as paving stone and for the buildings. Pietra serena
or macigno, a stone of a firm texture also used for building
purposes, is quarried at Monte Ceceri below Fiesole. The soil
is very fertile; wheat, Indian corn, olives, vines, fruit trees of
many kinds cover both the plain and the surrounding hills;
the chief non-fruit-bearing trees are the stone pine, the cypress,
the ilex and the poplar, while many other varieties are represented.
The gardens and fields produce an abundance of
flowers, which justify the city&rsquo;s title of la cittÃ  dei fiori.

Climate and Sanitary Conditions.&mdash;The climate of Florence
is very variable, ranging from severe cold accompanied by high
winds from the north in winter to great heat in the summer,
while in spring-time sudden and rapid changes of temperature
are frequent. At the same time the climate is usually very
agreeable from the end of February to the beginning of July,
and from the end of September to the middle of November.
The average temperature throughout the year is about 57Â°
Fahr.; the maximum heat is about 96.8Â°, and the minimum
36.5Â°, sometimes sinking to 21Â°. The longest day is 15 hours and
33 minutes, the shortest 8 hours and 50 minutes. The average
rainfall is about 37Â½ inches. Epidemic diseases are rare and
children&rsquo;s diseases mild; cholera has visited Florence several
times, but the city has been free from it for many years.
Diphtheria first appeared in 1868 and continued as a severe
epidemic until 1872, since when it has only occurred at rare intervals
and in isolated cases. Typhoid, pneumonia, tuberculosis,
measles and scarlatina, and influenza are the commonest illnesses.
The drainage system is still somewhat imperfect, but the water
brought from the hills or from the Arno in pipes is fairly good,
and the general sanitary conditions are satisfactory.

Public Buildings.&mdash;Of the very numerous Florentine churches
the Duomo (Santa Maria del Fiore) is the largest and most
important, founded in 1298 on the plans of Arnolfo
di Cambio, completed by Brunelleschi, and consecrated
Churches.
in 1436; the faÃ§ade, however, was not finished until the 19th
century&mdash;it was begun in 1875 on the designs of de Fabris and
unveiled in 1888. Close by the Duomo is the no less famous
Campanile built by Giotto, begun in 1332, and adorned with
exquisite bas-reliefs. Opposite is the Baptistery built by Arnolfo
di Cambio in the 13th century on the site of an earlier church,
and adorned with beautiful bronze doors by Ghiberti in the 15th
century. The Badia, Santo Spirito, Santa Maria Novella, are
a few among the many famous and beautiful churches of Florence.
The existence of these works of art attracts students from all
countries, and a German art school subsidized by the imperial
government has been instituted.

The streets and piazze of the city are celebrated for their
splendid palaces, formerly, and in many cases even to-day the
residences of the noble families of Florence. Among others we
may mention the Palazzo Vecchio, formerly the seat of the government
of the Republic and now the town hall, the Palazzo Riccardi,
the residence of the Medici and now the prefecture, the palaces of
the Strozzi, Antinori (one of the most perfect specimens of
Florentine quattrocento architecture), Corsini, Davanzati, Pitti
(the royal palace), &amp;c. The palace of the Arte della Lana or
gild of wool merchants, tastefully and intelligently restored, is
the headquarters of the Dante Society. The centre of Florence,
which was becoming a danger from a hygienic point of view,
was pulled down in 1880-1890, but, unfortunately, sufficient care
was not taken to avoid destroying certain buildings of historic
and artistic value which might have been spared without impairing
the work of sanitation, while the new structures erected
in their place, especially those in the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele,
are almost uniformly ugly and quite out of keeping with
Florentine architecture. The question aroused many polemics
at the time both in Italy and abroad. After the new centre was
built, a society called the SocietÃ  per la difesa di Firenze antica
was formed by many prominent citizens to safeguard the ancient
buildings and prevent them from destruction, and a spirit of
intelligent conservatism seems now to prevail in this connexion.
The city is growing in all directions, and a number of new quarters
have sprung up where the houses are more sanitary than in the
older parts, but unfortunately few of them evince much aesthetic
feeling. The viali or boulevards form pleasant residential streets
with gardens, and the system of building separate houses for
each family (villini) instead of large blocks of flats is becoming
more and more general.

Florence possesses four important libraries besides a number
of smaller collections. The Biblioteca Nazionale, originally
founded by Antonio Magliabecchi in 1747, enjoys the
right, shared by the Vittorio Emanuele library of
Libraries.
Rome, of receiving a copy of every work printed in Italy, since
1870 (since 1848 it had enjoyed a similar privilege with regard
to works printed in Tuscany). It contains some 500,000 printed
volumes, 700,000 pamphlets, over 9000 prints and drawings
(including 284 by Albert DÃ¼rer), nearly 20,000 MSS., and 40,000
letters. The number of readers in 1904 was over 50,000. Unfortunately,
however, the confusion engendered by a defective
organization has long been a byword among the people; there
is no printed catalogue, quantities of books are buried in packing-cases
and unavailable, the collection of foreign books is very poor,
hardly any new works being purchased, and the building itself
is quite inadequate and far from safe; but the site of a new
one has now been purchased and the plans are agreed upon,
so that eventually the whole collection will be transferred to
more suitable quarters. The Biblioteca Marucelliana, founded in
1752, contains 150,000 books, including 620 incunabula, 17,000
engravings and 1500 MSS.; it is well managed and chiefly
remarkable for its collection of illustrated works and art publications.
The Biblioteca Mediceo-Laurenziana, founded in 1571,
has its origin in the library of Cosimo de&rsquo; Medici the Elder, and
was enlarged by Piero, Giovanni and above all by Lorenzo the
Magnificent. Various princes and private persons presented it
with valuable gifts and legacies, among the most important of
which was the collection of editiones principes given by Count d&rsquo;Elci,
in 1841, and the Ashburnham collection of MSS. purchased by
the Italian Government in 1885. It contains nearly 10,000 MSS.,
including many magnificent illuminated missals and Bibles and a
number of valuable Greek and Latin texts, 242 incunabula and
11,000 printed books, chiefly dealing with palaeography; it is
in some ways the most important of the Florentine libraries.
The Biblioteca Riccardiana, founded in the 16th century by
Romolo Riccardi, contains nearly 4000 MSS., over 32,000 books
and 650 incunabula, chiefly relating to Florentine history. The
state archives are among the most complete in Italy, and contain
over 450,000 filze and registri and 126,000 charters, covering the
period from 726 to 1856.

Few cities are as rich as Florence in collections of works of
artistic and historic interest, although the great majority of
them belong to a comparatively limited period&mdash;from
the 13th to the 16th century. The chief art galleries

are the Uffizi, the Pitti and Accademia. The two
former are among the finest in the world, and are
filled with masterpieces by Raphael, Andrea del Sarto, Perugino,
Ghirlandaio, Botticelli, the Lippi, and many other Florentine,
Umbrian, Venetian, Dutch and Flemish artists, as well as numerous
admirable examples of antique, medieval and Renaissance
530
sculpture. The Pitti collection is in the royal palace (formerly
the residence of the grand dukes), and a fine new stairway
and vestibule have been constructed by royal munificence.
In the Uffizi the pictures are arranged in strict chronological
order. In the Accademia, which is rich in early Tuscan
masters, the Botticelli and Perugino rooms deserve special
mention. Other pictures are scattered about in the churches,
monasteries and private palaces. Of the monasteries, that of
St Mark should be mentioned, as containing many works of
Fra Angelico, besides relics of Savonarola, while of the private
collections the only one of importance is that of Prince Corsini.
There is a splendid museum of medieval and Renaissance
antiquities in the Bargello, the ancient palace of the PodestÃ ,
itself one of the finest buildings in the city; among its many
treasures are works of Donatello, Ghiberti, Verrochio and other
sculptors, and large collections of ivory, enamel and bronze
ware. The Opera del Duomo contains models and pieces of
sculpture connected with the cathedral; the Etruscan and
Egyptian museum, the gallery of tapestries, the Michelangelo
museum, the museum of natural history and other collections
are all important in different ways.

The total population of Florence in 1905, comprising foreigners
and a garrison of 5500 men, was 220,879. In 1861 it was 114,363;
it increased largely when the capital of Italy was in

slightly after the removal of the capital to Rome, and
increased at a greater rate from 1881 onwards. At present the
rate of increase is about 22 per 1000, but it is due to immigration,
as the birth rate was actually below the death rate down to 1903,
since when there has been a slight increase of the former and a
decrease of the latter.

Florence is the capital of a province of the same name, and the
central government is represented by a prefect (prefetto), while

The city is the seat of a court of cassation (for civil

There are 22 public elementary schools for boys and 18 for girls

pupils, and 56 private schools with 5700 pupils. Secondary

technical schools with 1375 pupils, three ginnasii or lower classical
schools, and three licei or higher classical schools, with 1000
pupils, and three training colleges with over 700 pupils. Higher
education is imparted at the university (Istituto di studii superiori
e di perfezionamento), with 600 to 650 students; although only
comprising the faculties of literature, medicine and natural science,
it is, as regards the first-named faculty, one of the most
important institutions in Italy. The original Studio Fiorentino
was founded in the 14th century, and acquired considerable fame
as a centre of learning under the Medici, enhanced by the presence in
Florence of many learned Greeks who had fled from Constantinople
after its capture by the Turks (1453). Although in 1472 some of the
faculties and several of the professors were transferred to Pisa, it
still retained importance, and in the 17th and 18th centuries it
originated a number of learned academies. In 1859 after the annexation
of Tuscany to the Italian kingdom it was revived and reorganized;
since then it has become to some extent a national centre of learning
and culture, attracting students from other parts of Italy, partly on
account of the fact that it is in Florence that the purest Italian is
spoken. The revival of classical studies on scientific principles in
modern Italy may be said to have begun in Florence, and great
activity has also been displayed in reviving the study of Dante;
Dante lectures being given regularly by scholars and men of letters
from all parts of the country, above the church of Or San Michele
as in the middle ages, under the auspices of the SocietÃ  Dantesca.
Palaeography, history and Romance languages are among the other
subjects to which especial importance is given. Besides the Istituto di
studii superiori there is the Istituto di scienze sociali &ldquo;Cesare Alfieri,&rdquo;
founded by the marchese Alfieri di Sostegno for the education of
aspirants to the diplomatic and consular services, and for students
of economics and social sciences (about 50 students); an academy
of fine arts, a conservatoire of music, a higher female training-college
with 150 students, a number of professional and trade schools, and
an academy of recitation. There are also many academies and learned
societies of different kinds, of which one of the most important is the
Accademia della Crusca for the study of the Italian language, which
undertook the publication of a monumental dictionary.

Several of the Florence hospitals are of great antiquity, the most
important being that of Santa Maria Nuova, which, founded by Folco
Portinari, the father of Dante&rsquo;s Beatrice, has been
thoroughly renovated according to modern scientific

principles. There are numerous other hospitals both
general and special, a foundling hospital dating from the 13th century
(Santa Maria degli Innocenti), an institute for the blind, one for the
deaf and dumb, &amp;c. Most of the hospitals and other charitable
institutions are endowed, but the endowments are supplemented by
private contributions.

glass works, iron foundries, a motor car factory, straw
hat factories, and power-houses supplying electricity for
lighting and for the numerous tramcars. There are, however, some
artistic industries in and around the city, of which the most important
is the Ginori-Richard porcelain works, and the Cantagalli majolica
works. There are many other smaller establishments, and the
Florentine artificer seems to possess an exceptional skill in all kinds
of work in which art is combined with technical ability. Another
very important source of revenue is the so-called &ldquo;tourist industry,&rdquo;
which in late years has assumed immense proportions; the city
contains a large number of hotels and boarding-houses which every
year are filled to overflowing with strangers from all parts of the
world.

History

Florentia was founded considerably later than Faesulae
(Fiesole), which lies on the hill above it; indeed, as its name
indicates, it was built only in Roman times and probably in
connexion with the construction by C. Flaminius in 187 B.C.
of a road from Bononia to Arretium (which later on formed part
of the Via Cassia) at the point where this road crossed the river
Arnus. We hear very little of it in ancient times; it appears to
have suffered at the end of the war between Marius and Sulla,
and in A.D. 15 (by which period it seems to have been already
a colony) it successfully opposed the project of diverting part of
the waters of the Clanis into the Arno (see Chiana). Tacitus
mentions it, and Florus describes it as one of the municipia
splendidissima. A bishop of Florence is mentioned in A.D. 313.
A group of Italic cremation tombs a pozzo of the Villanova
period were found under the pavement of the medieval Vicolo
del Campidoglio. This took its name from the Capitolium of
Roman times, the remains of which were found under the Piazza
Luna; the three cellae were clearly traceable. The capitals
of the columns were Corinthian, about 4 ft. in diameter, and it
became clear that this temple had supplied building materials
for S. Giovanni and S. Miniato. Fragments of a fine octagonal
altar, probably belonging to the temple, were found. Remains
of baths have been found close by, while the ancient amphitheatre
has been found near S. Croce outside the Roman town,
which formed a rectangle of about 400 by 600 yds., with four
gates, the Decumanus being represented by the Via Strozzi and
Via del Corso, and the Cardo by the Via Calcinara, while the
Mercato Vecchio occupied the site of the Forum.

Lincei, vi. (1896), 5 seq.

The first event of importance recorded is the siege of the city
by the Goths, A.D. 405, and its deliverance by the Roman general
Stilicho. Totila besieged Florence in 542, but was repulsed by
the imperial garrison under Justin, and later it was occupied
by the Goths. We find the Longobards in Tuscany in 570, and
mention is made of one Gudibrandus Dux civitatis Florentinorum,
which suggests that Florence was the capital of a duchy (one of
the regular divisions of the Longobard empire). Charlemagne
was in Florence in 786 and conferred many favours on the city,
which continued to grow in importance owing to its situation
on the road from northern Italy to Rome. At the time of the
agitation against simony and the corruption of the clergy, the
head of the movement in Florence was San Giovanni Gualberto,
of the monastery of San Salvi. The simoniacal election of Pietro
Mezzabarba as bishop of Florence (1068) caused serious disturbances
and a long controversy with Rome, which ended in the
triumph, after a trial by fire, of the monk Petrus Igneus, champion
of the popular reform movement; this event indicates the
beginnings of a popular conscience among the Florentines.
531
Under the Carolingian emperors Tuscany was a March or
margraviate, and the marquises became so powerful as to be
even a danger to the Empire. Under the emperor Otto I. one
Ugo (d, 1001) was marquis, and the emperor Conrad II. (elected
in 1024) appointed Boniface of Canossa marquis of Tuscany,
a territory then extending from the Po to the borders of the
Roman state. Boniface died in 1052, and in the following year
The countess Matilda.Guelphs and Ghibellines.
the margraviate passed to his daughter, the famous
countess Matilda, who ruled for forty years and played
a prominent part in the history of Italy in that period.
In the Wars of the Investitures Matilda was ever on
the papal (afterwards called Guelph) side against the emperor
and the faction afterwards known as Ghibelline, and
she herself often led armies to battle. It is at this
time that the people of Florence first began to acquire
influence, and while the countess presided at the courts
of justice in the name of the Empire, she was assisted by a group
of great feudal nobles, judges, lawyers, &amp;c., who formed, as
elsewhere in Tuscany, the boni homines or sapientes. As the
countess was frequently absent these boni homines gave judgment
without her, thus paving the way for a free commune. The
citizens found themselves in opposition to the nobility of the
hills around the city, Teutonic feudatories of Ghibelline
sympathies, who interfered with their commerce. Florence
frequently waged war with these nobles and with other cities
on its own account, although in the name of the countess, and
the citizens began to form themselves into groups and associations
which were the germs of the arti or gilds. After the death of
Beginnings of the commune.
Countess Matilda in 1115 the grandi or boni homines
continued to rule and administer justice, but in the
name of the people&mdash;a change hardly noticed at first,
but which marks the foundation of the commune.
After 1138 the boni homines began to be called consules, while
the population was divided into the grandi or delle torri, i.e. the
noble families who had towers, and the arti or trade and merchant
gilds. At first the consules, of whom there seem to have been
twelve, two for each sestiere or ward, were chosen by the men
of the towers, and assisted by a council of 100 boni homines, in
which the arti were predominant; the government thus came to
be in the hands of a few powerful families. The republic now
proceeded to extend its power. In 1125 Fiesole was sacked and
destroyed, but the feudal nobles of the contado (surrounding
country), protected by the imperial margraves, were still powerful.
The early margraves had permitted the Florentines to wage
war against the Alberti family, whose castles they destroyed.
The emperor Lothair when in Italy forced Florence to submit
to his authority, but at his death in 1137 things returned to their
former state and the Florentines fought successfully against the
powerful counts Guidi. Frederick Barbarossa, however, elected
emperor in 1152, made his authority felt in Tuscany, and appointed
one Welf of Bavaria as margrave. Florence and other
cities were forced to supply troops to the emperor for his Lombard
campaigns, and he began to establish a centralized imperial
bureaucracy in Tuscany, appointing a potestas, who resided at
San Miniato (whence the name of &ldquo;San Miniato al Tedesco&rdquo;),
to represent him and exercise authority in the contado; this
double authority of the consoli in the town and the potestas or
podestÃ  outside generated confusion. By 1176 the Florentines
were masters of all the territory comprised in the dioceses of
War with the nobles.
Florence and Fiesole; but civil commotion within
the city broke out between the consoli and the greater
nobles, headed by the Alberti and strengthened by
the many feudal families who had been forced to leave their
castles and dwell in the city (1177-1180). In the end the Alberti,
though not victorious, succeeded in getting occasionally admitted
to the consulship. Florence now formed a league with the chief
cities of Tuscany, made peace with the Guidi, and humbled the
Alberti whose castle of Semifonte was destroyed (1202). Later

we find a potestas within the city, elected for a year
and assisted by seven councillors and seven rectores
super capitibus artium. This represented the triumph
of the feudal party, which had gained the support of the arti
minori or minor gilds. The potestates subsequently were
foreigners, and in 1207 the dignity was conferred on Gualfredotto
of Milan; a new council was formed, the consiglio del comune,
while the older senate still survived. The Florentines now
undertook to open the highways of commerce towards Rome,
for their city was already an important industrial and banking
centre.

Discord among the great families broke out again, and the
attempt to put an end to it by a marriage between Buondelmonte
de&rsquo; Buondelmonti and a daughter of the Amidei, only led to
further strife (1215), although the causes of these broils were
deeper and wider, being derived from the general division between
Guelphs and Ghibellines all over Italy. But the work of crushing
the nobles of the contado and of asserting the city&rsquo;s position
among rival communes continued. In 1222 Florence waged war
successfully on Pisa, Lucca and Pistoia, and during the next
few years against the Sienese with varying results; although
the emperor supported the latter as Ghibellines, on his departure
for Germany in 1235 they were forced to accept peace on onerous
terms. During the interregnum (1241-1243) following on the
death of Pope Gregory IX. the Ghibelline cause revived in Tuscany
and imperial authority was re-established. The tumults against
the Paterine heretics (1244-1245), among whom were many
Ghibelline nobles favoured by the podestÃ  Pace di Pesamigola,
indicate a successful Guelphic reaction; but Frederick II.,
having defeated his enemies both in Lombardy and in the Two
Sicilies, appointed his natural son, Frederick of Antioch, imperial
vicar in Tuscany, who, when civil war broke out, entered the
city with 1600 German knights. The Ghibellines now triumphed
completely, and in 1249 the Guelph leaders were driven into
exile&mdash;the first of many instances in Florentine history of exile
en masse of a defeated party. The attempt to seize Montevarchi
and other castles where the Guelph exiles were congregated
failed, and in 1250 the burghers elected thirty-six caporali di
popolo, who formed the basis of the primo popolo or body of
citizens independent of the nobles, headed by the capitano
del popolo. The Ghibellines being unable to maintain their
Comune and popolo.
supremacy, the city came to be divided into two
almost autonomous republics, the comune headed by
the podestÃ , and the popolo headed by the capitano and
militarily organized into twenty companies; the central
power was represented by twelve anziani or elders. The podestÃ ,
who was always a foreigner, usually commanded the army, represented
the city before foreign powers, and signed treaties. He
was assisted by the consiglio speciale of 90 and the consiglio
generale e speciale of 300, composed of nobles, while the capitano
del popolo had also two councils composed of burghers, heads of
the gilds, gonfalonieri of the companies, &amp;c. The anziani had a
council of 36 burghers, and then there was the parlamento or
general assembly of the people, which met only on great
occasions. At this time the podestÃ &rsquo;s palace (the Bargello) was
built, and the gold florin was first coined and soon came to be
accepted as the standard gold piece throughout Europe. But,
although greatly strengthened, the Guelphs, who now may be
called the democrats as opposed to the Ghibelline aristocrats,
were by no means wholly victorious, and in 1251 they had to
defend themselves against a league of Ghibelline cities (Siena,
Pisa and Pistoia) assisted by Florentine Ghibellines; the
Florentine Uberti, who had been driven into exile after their
plot of 1258, took refuge in Siena and encouraged that city in
its hostility to Florence. Fresh disputes about the possession
of Montepulciano and other places having arisen, the Florentines
declared war once more. A Florentine army assisted by Guelphs
of other towns was cunningly induced to believe that Siena
would surrender at the first summons; but it was met by a
Sienese army reinforced by Florentine exiles, including Farinata
degli Uberti and other Ghibellines, and by the cavalry of Manfred

(q.v.) of Sicily, led by Count Giordano and the count
of Arras, with the result that the Florentines were
totally routed at Montaperti on the 4th of September
1260. Count Giordano entered Florence, appointed
Count Guido Novello podestÃ , and began a series of persecutions
532
against the Guelphs. The Ghibellines even proposed to raze the
walls of the city, but Farinata degli Uberti strongly opposed the
idea, saying that &ldquo;he had fought to regain and not to ruin his
fatherland.&rdquo;

During this new Ghibelline predominance (1260-1266) the
old liberties were abolished, and the popolo was deprived of all
share in the administration. But when Charles I.
(q.v.) of Anjou descended into Italy as champion of
New constitution.
the papacy, and Manfred was defeated and killed
(1266), the popolo, who had acquired wealth in trade and industry,
was ready to rise. After some disturbances Guido Novello and
the Ghibellines were expelled, but it was not the popolo who
triumphed; the pope and Charles were the real masters of the
situation, and the Florentines found they had exchanged a
foreign and Ghibelline protector for one who was foreign and
Guelph. Nevertheless much of the old order was restored;
the podestÃ  who represented King Charles was assisted by 12
buoni uomini, and by the council of the 100 buoni uomini del
popolo, &ldquo;without the deliberation of whom,&rdquo; says Villani, &ldquo;no
great matter nor expenditure could be undertaken.&rdquo; Other
bodies and magistrates were maintained, and the capitano del
popolo, now called capitano della massa di parte Guelfa, tended
to become a very important person. The property of the
Ghibellines was confiscated, and a commission of six capitani
di parte Guelfa appointed to administer it and in general to
expend it for the persecution of the Ghibellines. The whole
constitution of the republic, although of very democratic
tendencies, seemed designed to promote civil strife and weaken
the central power.

While the constitution was evolving in a manner which seemed
to argue small political ability and no stability in the Florentines,
the people had built up a wonderful commercial
organization. Each of the seven arti maggiori or
Florentine trade and the gilds.
greater gilds was organized like a small state with its
councils, statutes, assemblies, magistrates, &amp;c., and
in times of trouble constituted a citizen militia. Florentine
cloth especially was known and sold all over Europe, and the
Florentines were regarded as the first merchants of the age.
If the life of the city went on uninterruptedly even during the
many changes of government and the almost endemic civil war,
it was owing to the solidity of the gilds, who could carry on the
administration without a government.

After Charles&rsquo;s victory over Conradin in 1268 the Florentines
defeated the Sienese (1269) and made frequent raids into Pisan
territory. As Charles perpetually interfered in their
affairs, always favouring the grandi or Guelph nobles,
Cardinal Latino.
some of the Ghibellines were recalled as a counterpoise,
which, however, only led to further civil strife. Rudolph of
Habsburg, elected king of the Romans in 1273, having come
to terms with Pope Nicholas III., Charles was obliged in 1278
to give up his title of imperial vicar in Tuscany, which he had
held during the interregnum following on the death of Frederick
II. In 1279 Pope Nicholas sent his nephew, the friar preacher
Latino Frangipani Malabranca, whom he had created cardinal
bishop of Ostia the same year, to reconcile the parties in Florence
once more. Cardinal Latino to some extent succeeded, and was
granted a kind of temporary dictatorship. He raised the 12
buoni uomini to 14 (8 Guelphs and 6 Ghibellines), to be changed
every two months; and they were assisted by a council of 100.
A force of 1000 men was placed at the disposal of the podestÃ 
and capitano (now both elected by the people) to keep order and
oblige the grandi to respect the law. The Sicilian Vespers (q.v.)
by weakening Charles strengthened the commune, which aimed
at complete independence of emperors, kings and popes. After
1282 the signoria was composed of the 3 (afterwards 6) priori
of the gilds, who ended by ousting the buoni uomini, while a
defensor artificum et artium takes the place of the capitano;
thus the republic became an essentially trading community,
governed by the popolani grassi or rich merchants.

The republic now turned to the task of breaking the power
of the Ghibelline cities of Pisa and Arezzo. In 1289 the Aretini
were completely defeated by the Florentines at Campaldino, a
battle made famous by the fact that Dante took part in it.
War against the Pisans, who had been defeated by the Genoese
Battle of Campaldino (1289).
in the naval battle of La Meloria in 1284, was
carried on in a desultory fashion, and in 1293 peace was
made. But the grandi, who had largely contributed
to the victory of Campaldino, especially men like Corso
Donati and Vieri de&rsquo; Cerchi, were becoming more powerful, and
Charles had increased their number by creating a great many
knights; but their attempts to interfere with the administration
of justice were severely repressed, and new laws were passed to
reduce their influence. Among other internal reforms the abolition
of the last traces of servitude in 1289, and the increase in
the number of arti, first to 12 and then to 21 (7 maggiori and 14
minori) must be mentioned. This, however, was not enough for
the Florentine democracy, who viewed with alarm the increasing
power and arrogance of the grandi, who in spite of their exclusion
from many offices were still influential and constituted independent
clans within the state. The law obliged each member
of the clan (consorteria) to sodare for all the other members, i.e.
to give a pecuniary guarantee to ensure payment of fines for
offences committed by any one of their number, a provision
made necessary by the fact that the whole clan acted collectively.
But as the laws were not always enforced new and severe ones
Ordinamenti della Giustizia (1293).
were enacted. These were the famous Ordinamenti
della Giustizia of 1293, by which all who were not of
the arti were definitely excluded from the signory.
The priori were to remain in office two months and
elected the gonfaloniere, also for two months; there were the
capitudini or councils of the gilds, and two savi for each sestiere,
with 1000 soldiers at their disposal; the number of the grandi
families was fixed at 38 (later 72). Judgment in matters concerning
the Ordinamenti was delivered in a summary fashion
without appeal. The leading spirit of this reform was Giano
della Bella, a noble who by engaging in trade had become a
popolano; the grandi now tried to make him unpopular with the
popolani grassi, hoping that without him the Ordinamenti would
not be executed, and opened negotiations with Pope Boniface
VIII. (elected 1294), who aimed at extending his authority in
Tuscany. A signory adverse to Giano having been elected, he
was driven into exile in 1295. The grandi regained some of their
power by corrupting the podestÃ  and by the favour of the popolo
minuto or unorganized populace; but their quarrels among
themselves prevented them from completely succeeding, while
the arti were solid.

In 1295 a signory favourable to the grandi enacted a law
attenuating the Ordinamenti, but now the grandi split into two
factions, one headed by the Donati, which hoped to
abolish the Ordinamenti, and the other by the Cerchi,
The Bianchi and the Neri.
which had given up all hope of their abolition; afterwards
these parties came to be called Neri (Blacks)
and Bianchi (Whites). A plot of the Donati to establish their
influence over Florence with the help of Boniface VIII. having
been discovered (May 1300), serious riots broke out between the
Neri and the Bianchi. The pope&rsquo;s attempt to unite the grandi
having failed, he summoned Charles of Valois to come to his
assistance, promising him the imperial crown; in 1301 Charles
entered Italy, and was created by the pope paciaro or peacemaker
of Tuscany, with instructions to crush the Bianchi and
the popolo and exalt the Neri. On the 1st of November Charles
reached Florence, promising to respect its laws; but he permitted
Corso Donati and his friends to attack the Bianchi, and the new
podestÃ , Cante dei Gabrielli of Gubbio, who had come with Charles,
punished many of that faction; among those whom he exiled
was the poet Dante (1302). Corso Donati, who for some time
was the most powerful man in Florence, made himself many
enemies by his arrogance, and was obliged to rely on the popolo
grasso, the irritation against him resulting in a rising in which
he was killed (1308). In this same year Henry of Luxemburg
was elected king of the Romans and with the pope&rsquo;s favour he
came to Italy in 1310; the Florentine exiles and all the Ghibellines
of Italy regarded him as a saviour and regenerator of the
country, while the Guelphs of Florence on the contrary opposed
533
both him and the pope as dangerous to their own liberties and
accepted the protection of King Robert of Naples, disregarding
Henry&rsquo;s summons to submission. In 1312 Henry was crowned
emperor as Henry VII. in Rome, but instead of the universal
ruler and pacifier which he tried to be, he was forced by circumstances
into being merely a German kaiser who tried to subjugate
free Italian communes. He besieged Florence without success,
and died of disease in 1313.

The Pisans, fearing the vengeance of the Guelphs now that
Henry was dead, had accepted the lordship of Uguccione della
Fagginola, imperial vicar in Genoa. A brave general
and an ambitious man, he captured Lucca and defeated
Uguccione della Fagginola and Castruccio Castracani.
the Florentines and their allies from Naples at Montecatini
in 1315, but the following year he lost both Pisa
and Lucca and had to fly from Tuscany. A new danger
now threatened Florence in the person of Castruccio
Castracani degli Antelminelli (q.v.), who made himself
lord of Lucca and secured help from Matteo Visconti, lord of
Milan, and other Ghibellines of northern Italy. Between 1320 and
1323 he harried the Florentines and defeated them several times,
captured Pistoia, devastated their territory up to the walls of
the city in spite of assistance from Naples under Raymundo
de Cardona and the duke of Calabria (King Robert&rsquo;s son);
never before had Florence been so humiliated, but while
Castruccio was preparing to attack Florence he died in 1328.
Two months later the duke of Calabria, who had been appointed
protector of the city in 1325, died, and further constitutional
reforms were made. The former councils were replaced by the
consiglio del popolo, consisting of 300 popolani and presided over
by the capitano, and the consiglio del comune of 250 members,
half of them nobles and half popolani, presided over by the
podestÃ . The priori and other officers were drawn by lot from
among the Guelphs over thirty years old who were declared fit
for public office by a special board of 98 citizens (1329). The
system worked well at first, but abuses soon crept in, and many
persons were unjustly excluded from office; trouble being
expected in 1335 a captain of the guard was created. But the
first one appointed, Jacopo dei Gabrielli of Gubbio, used his
dictatorial powers so ruthlessly that at the end of his year of
office no successor was chosen.

The Florentines now turned their eyes towards Lucca; they
might have acquired the city immediately after Castruccio&rsquo;s
death for 80,000 florins, but failed to do so owing to
differences of opinion in the signory; Martino della

Scala, lord of Verona, promised it to them in 1335, but
broke his word, and although their finances were not
then very flourishing they allied themselves with Venice to make
war on him. They were successful at first, but Venice made a
truce with the Scala independently of the Florentines, and by
the peace of 1339 they only obtained a part of Lucchese territory.
At the same time they purchased from the Tarlati the protectorate
over Arezzo for ten years. But misfortunes fell on the city:
Edward III. of England repudiated the heavy debts contracted
for his wars in France with the Florentine banking houses of
Bardi and Peruzzi (1339), which eventually led to their failure
and to that of many smaller firms, and shook Florentine credit
all over the world; Philip VI. of France extorted large sums
from the Florentine merchants and bankers in his dominions
by accusing them of usury; in 1340 plague and famine wrought
terrible havoc in Florence, and riots again broke out between the
grandi and the popolo, partly on account of the late unsuccessful
wars and the unsatisfactory state of the finances. To put an

end to these disorders, Walter of Brienne, duke of
Athens, was elected &ldquo;conservator&rdquo; and captain of
the guard in 1342. An astute, dissolute and ambitious
man, half French and half Levantine, he began his
government by a policy of conciliation and impartial justice
which won him great popularity. But as soon as he thought
the ground was secure he succeeded in getting himself acclaimed
by the populace lord of Florence for life, and on the 8th of
September was carried in triumph to the Palazzo della Signoria.
The podestÃ  and the capitano assenting to this treachery, he
dismissed the gonfaloniere, reduced the priori to a position of
impotence, disarmed the citizens, and soon afterwards accepted
the lordship of Arezzo, Volterra, Colle, San Gimignano and
Pistoia. He increased his bodyguard to 800 men, all Frenchmen,
who behaved with the greatest licence and brutality; by his
oppressive taxes, and his ferocious cruelty towards all who
opposed him, and the unsatisfactory treaties he concluded with
Pisa, he accumulated bitter hatred against his rule. The
grandi were disappointed because he had not crushed the
popolo, and the latter because he had destroyed their liberties
and interfered with the organization of the arti. Many unsuccessful
plots against him were hatched, and having discovered one
that was conducted by Antonio degli Adimari, the duke summoned
the latter to the palace and detained him a prisoner. He also
summoned 300 leading citizens on the pretext of wishing to
consult them, but fearing treachery they refused to come. On
the 26th of July 1343, the citizens rose in arms, demanded the
duke&rsquo;s abdication, and besieged him in the palace. Help came
to the Florentines from neighbouring cities, the podestÃ  was expelled,
and a balÃ¬a or provisional government of 14 was elected.
The duke was forced to set Adimari and his other prisoners free,
and several of his men-at-arms were killed by the populace;
three of his chief henchmen, whom he was obliged to surrender,
were literally torn to pieces, and finally on the 1st of August he
had to resign his lordship. He departed from Florence under a
strong guard a few days later, and the Fourteen cancelled all
his enactments.

The expulsion of the duke of Athens was followed by several
measures to humble the grandi still further, while the popolo
minuto or artisans began to show signs of discontent
at the rule of the merchants, and the populace destroyed
New constitution.
the houses of many nobles. As soon as order was
restored a balÃ¬a was appointed to reform the government, in
which task it was assisted by the Sienese and Perugian
ambassadors and by Simone da Battifolle. The priori were
reduced to 8 (2 popolani grassi, 3 mediani and 3 artifici minuti),
while the gonfaloniere was to be chosen in turn from each of those
classes; the grandi were excluded from the administration, but
they were still admitted to the consiglio del comune, the cinque
di mercanzia, and other offices pertaining to the commune; the
Ordinamenti were maintained but in a somewhat attenuated
form, and certain grandi as a favour were declared to be of the
popolo. Florence was now a thoroughly democratic and commercial
republic, and its whole policy was mainly dominated by
commercial considerations: its rivalry with Pisa was due to an
ambition to gain secure access to the sea; its strong Guelphism
was the outcome of its determination to secure the bank-business
of the papacy; and its desire to extend its territory in Tuscany
to the necessity for keeping open the land trade routes.
Florentine democracy, however, was limited to the walls of the
city, for no one of the contado nor any citizen of the subject
towns enjoyed political rights, which were reserved for the inhabitants
of Florence alone and not by any means for all of them.

Florence was in the 14th century a city of about 100,000
inhabitants, of whom 25,000 could bear arms; there were 110
churches, 39 religious houses; the shops of the arte
della lana numbered over 200, producing cloth worth
Statistics.
1,200,000 florins; Florentine bankers and merchants were found
all over the world, often occupying responsible positions in the
service of foreign governments; the revenues of the republic,
derived chiefly from the city customs, amounted to some 300,000
florins, whereas its ordinary expenses, exclusive of military
matters and public buildings, were barely 40,000. It was already
a centre of art and letters and full of fine buildings, pictures and
libraries. But now that the grandi were suppressed politically,
the lowest classes came into prominence, &ldquo;adventurers without
sense or virtue and of no authority for the most part, who had
usurped public offices by illicit and dishonest practices&rdquo; (Matteo
Villani, iv. 69); this paved the way for tyranny.

In 1347 Florence was again stricken with famine, followed
the next year by the most terrible plague it had ever experienced,
which carried off three-fifths of the population (according to
534
Villani). Yet in spite of these disasters the republic was

by no means crushed; it soon regained the suzerainty of
many cities which had broken off all connexion
with it after the expulsion of the duke of Athens,
and purchased the overlordship of Prato from Queen
Joanna of Naples, who had inherited it from the
duke of Calabria. In 1351 Giovanni Visconti, lord and archbishop
of Milan, having purchased Bologna and allied himself with
sundry Ghibelline houses of Tuscany with a view to

dominating Florence, the city made war on him, and in
violation of its Guelph traditions placed itself under the
protection of the emperor Charles IV. (1355) for his lifetime.
This move, however, was not popular, and it enabled
the grandi, who, although excluded from the chief offices, still
dominated the parte Guelfa, to reassert themselves. They had in
1347 succeeded in enacting a very stringent law against all who
were in any way tainted with Ghibellinism, which, they themselves
being above suspicion in that connexion, enabled them to drive
from office many members of the popolo minuto. In 1358 the
parte Guelfa made these enactments still more stringent, punishing
with death or heavy fines all who being Ghibellines held
office, and provided that if trustworthy witnesses were forthcoming
condemnations might be passed for this offence without
hearing the accused; even a non-proved charge or an ammonizione
(warning not to accept office) might entail disfranchisement.
Thus the parte, represented by its 6 (afterwards 9) captains,
came to exercise a veritable reign of terror, and no one knew
when an accusation might fall on him. The leader of the parte
was Piero degli Albizzi, whose chief rivals were the Ricci family.

Italy at this time began to be overrun by bands of soldiers

into contact was the Great Company, commanded by
the count of Lando, which twice entered Tuscany
but was expelled both times by the Florentine troops
(1358-1359).

In 1362 we find Florence at war with Pisa on account of
commercial differences, and because the former had acquired
the lordship of Volterra. The Florentines were successful
until Pisa enlisted Sir John Hawkwood&rsquo;s English company;
the latter won several battles, but were at last defeated at
Cascina, and peace was made in 1364, neither side having gained
much advantage. A fresh danger threatened the republic in
1367 when Charles IV., who had allied himself with Pope Urban
V., Queen Joanna of Naples, and various north Italian despots
to humble the Visconti, demanded that the Florentines should
join the league. This they refused to do and armed themselves
for defence, but eventually satisfied the emperor with a money
payment.

The tyranny of the parte Guelfa still continued unabated,
and the capitani carried an enactment by which no measure
affecting the parte should be even discussed by the
signory unless previously approved of by them. This

infamous law, however, aroused so much opposition
that some of the very men who had proposed it assembled in secret
to discuss its abolition, and a quarrel between the Albizzi and
the Ricci having weakened the parte, a balÃ¬a of 56 was agreed
upon. Several of the Albizzi and the Ricci were excluded from
office for five years, and a council called the Ten of Liberty was
created to defend the laws and protect the weak against the
strong. The parte Guelfa and the Albizzi still remained very
influential and the attempts to abolish admonitions failed.

In 1375 Florence became involved in a war which showed
how the old party divisions of Italy had been obliterated. The
papal legate at Bologna, Cardinal Guillaume de Noellet
(d. 1394), although the church was then allied to
War with the church (1375-78).
Florence, was meditating the annexation of the city to
the Holy See; he refused a request of the Florentines
for grain from Romagna, and authorized Hawkwood to devastate
their territory. Although a large part of the people disliked
the idea of a conflict with the church, an alliance with Florence&rsquo;s
old enemy BernabÃ² Visconti was made, war declared, and a
balÃ¬a of 8, the Otto della guerra (afterwards called the &ldquo;Eight
Saints&rdquo; on account of their good management) was created
to carry on the campaign. Treaties with Pisa, Siena, Arezzo
and Cortona were concluded, and soon no less than 80 towns,
including Bologna, had thrown off the papal yoke. Pope Gregory
XI. placed Florence under an interdict, ordered the expulsion
of all Florentines from foreign countries, and engaged a ferocious
company of Bretons to invade the republic&rsquo;s territory. The
Eight levied heavy toll on church property and ordered the
priests to disregard the interdict. They turned the tables on
the pope by engaging Hawkwood, and although the Bretons by
order of Cardinal Robert of Geneva (afterwards the anti-pope
Clement VII.) committed frightful atrocities in Romagna,
their captains were bribed by the republic not to molest its
territory. By 1378 peace was made, partly through the mediation
of St Catherine of Siena, and the interdict was removed
in consideration of the republic&rsquo;s paying a fine of 200,000 florins
to the pope.

During the war the Eight had been practically rulers of the
city, but now the parte Guelfa, led by Lapo da Castiglionchio
and Piero degli Albizzi, attempted to reassert itself
by illicit interference in the elections and by a liberal

use of &ldquo;admonitions&rdquo; (ammonizioni). Salvestro de&rsquo;
Medici, who had always opposed the parte, having been
elected gonfaloniere in spite of its intrigues, proposed a law for
the abolition of the admonitions, which was eventually passed
(June 18, 1378), but the people had been aroused, and desired
to break the power of the parte for good. Rioting occurred
on the 21st of June, and the houses of the Albizzi and other
nobles were burnt. The signory meanwhile created a balÃ¬a
of 80 which repealed some of the laws promoted by the parte,
and partly enfranchised the ammoniti. The people were still
unsatisfied, the arti minori demanded further privileges, and
the workmen insisted that their grievances against the arti
maggiori, especially the wool trade by whom they were employed,

be redressed. A large body of ciompi (wool carders)
gathered outside the city and conspired to subvert
the signory and establish a popular government.
Although the plot, in which Salvestro does
not seem to have played a part, was revealed, a good
deal of mob violence occurred, and on the 21st of July the
populace seized the podestÃ &rsquo;s palace, which they made their
headquarters. They demanded a share in the government for
the popolo minuto, but as soon as this was granted Tommaso
Strozzi, as spokesman of the ciompi, obliged the signory to
resign their powers to the Eight. Once the people were in
possession of the palace, a ciompo named Michele di Lando
took the lead and put a stop to disorder and pillage. He remained
master of Florence for one day, during which he reformed
the constitution, probably with the help of Salvestro de&rsquo; Medici.
Three new gilds were created, and nine priors appointed, three
from the arti maggiori, three from the minori, and three from
the new ones, while each of these classes in turn was to choose
the gonfaloniere of justice; the first to hold the office was Michele
di Lando. This did not satisfy the ciompi, and the disorders
provoked by them resulted in a new government which reformed
the two councils so as to exclude the lower orders. But to satisfy
the people several of the grandi, including Piero degli Albizzi,
were put to death, on charges of conspiracy, and many others
were exiled. There was perpetual rioting and anarchy, and
interference in the affairs of the government by the working
men, while at the same time poverty and unemployment increased
owing to the timidity of capital and the disorders, until at last
in 1382 a reaction set in, and order was restored by the gild
companies. Again a new constitution was decreed by which
the gonfaloniere and half the priori were to be chosen from the
arti maggiori and the other half from the minori; on several
other boards the former were to be in the majority, and the
three new gilds were abolished. The demagogues were executed
or forced to fly, and Michele di Lando with great ingratitude
was exiled. Several subsequent risings of the ciompi, largely
of an economic character, were put down, and the Guelph
families gradually regained much of their lost power, of which
535
they availed themselves to exile their opponents and revive
the odious system of ammonizioni.

Meanwhile in foreign affairs the republic maintained its
position, and in 1383 it regained Arezzo by purchase from the
lieutenant of Charles of Durazzo. In 1390 Gian Galeazzo
Visconti, having made himself master of a large part of northern
Italy, intrigued to gain possession of Pisa and Siena. Florence,
alone in resisting him, engaged Hawkwood, who with an army
of 7000 men more than held his own against the powerful lord
of Milan, and in 1392 a peace was concluded which the republic
strengthened by an alliance with Pisa and several north Italian
states. In 1393 Maso degli Albizzi was made gonfaloniere, and
for many years remained almost master of Florence owing to his
influential position in the Arte della Lana. A severe persecution
was initiated against the Alberti and other families, who were
disfranchised and exiled. Disorders and conspiracies against the
merchant oligarchy continued, and although they were unsuccessful
party passion was incredibly bitter, and the exiles caused
the republic much trouble by intriguing against it in foreign
states. In 1397-1398 Florence had two more wars with Gian
Galeazzo Visconti, who, aspiring to the conquest of Tuscany,
acquired the lordship of Pisa, Siena and Perugia. Hawkwood
being dead, Florence purchased aid from the emperor Rupert.
The Imperialists were beaten; but just as the Milanese were about
to march on Florence, Visconti died. His territories were then
divided between his sons and his condottieri, and Florence,
ever keeping her eye on Pisa, now ruled by Gabriele Maria
Visconti, made an alliance with Pope Boniface IX., who wished
to regain Perugia and Bologna. War broke out once more, and
the allies were successful, but as soon as Boniface had gained his
ends he made peace, leaving the Florentines unsatisfied. In
Attempts to acquire Pisa (1402-6).
1404 their attempt to capture Pisa single-handed
failed, and Gabriele Maria placed himself under the
protection of the French king. The Florentines then
made overtures to France, who had supported the
anti-popes all through the great schism, and suggested that they
too would support the then anti-pope, Benedict XIII., in exchange
for the sale of Pisa. This was agreed to, and in 1405 the
city was sold to Florence for 260,000 florins; and Gino Capponi,1
the Florentine commissioner, took possession of the citadel,
but a few days later the citizens arose in arms and recaptured
it from the mercenaries. There was great consternation in
Florence at the news, and every man in the city &ldquo;determined
that he would go naked rather than not conquer Pisa&rdquo; (G.
Capponi). The next year that city, then ruled by Giovanni
Gambacorti, was besieged by the Florentines, who blockaded the
mouth of the Arno. After a six months&rsquo; siege Pisa surrendered
on terms (9th October 1406), and, although it was not sacked,
many of the citizens were exiled and others forced to live in
Florence, a depopulation from which it never recovered. Florence
now acquired a great seaport and was at last able to develop a
direct maritime trade.

Except in connexion with the Pisan question the republic
had taken no definite side in the great schism which had divided
the church since 1378, but in 1408 she appealed both
to Pope Gregory XII. and the anti-pope Benedict
The council of Pisa (1408).
XIII. as well as to various foreign governments in
favour of a settlement, and suggested a council within
her own territory. Gregory refused, but after consulting a committee
of theologians who declared him to be a heretic, the council
promoted by Cardinal Cossa and other independent prelates
met at Pisa. This nearly led to war with King Ladislas of
Naples, because he had seized Rome, which he could only hold
so long as the church was divided. The council deposed both
popes and elected Pietro Filargi as Alexander V. (26th of June).
But Ladislas still occupied the papal states, and Florence,
alarmed at his growing power and ambition, formed a league with
Siena, Bologna and Louis of Anjou who laid claim to the Neapolitan
throne, to drive Ladislas from Rome. Cortona, Orvieto,
Viterbo and other cities were recovered for Alexander, and in
January 1410 Rome itself was captured by the Florentines under
Malatesta dei Malatesti. Alexander having died in May before
entering the Eternal City, Cardinal Cossa was elected as John
XXIII.; Florence without offending him made peace with
Ladislas, who had ceased to be dangerous, and purchased
Cortona of the pope. In 1413 Ladislas attacked the papal
states once more, driving John from Rome, and threatened
Florence; but like Henry VII., Gian Galeazzo Visconti, and
other enemies of the republic, he too died most opportunely
(6th of August 1414). John having lost all authority after
leaving Rome, a new council was held at Constance, which put
an end to the schism in 1417 with the election of Martin V.
The new pope came to Florence in 1419 as he had not yet regained
Rome, which was held by Francesco Sforza for Queen
Joanna II. of Naples, and remained there until the following
year.

No important changes in the constitution took place during
this period except the appointment of two new councils in 1411
to decide on questions of peace and war. The aristocratic faction
headed by Maso degli Albizzi, a wise and popular statesman, had
remained predominant, and at Maso&rsquo;s death in 1417 he was
succeeded in the leadership of the party by NiccolÃ² da Uzzano.
In 1421 Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici was elected gonfaloniere of justice,
an event which marks the beginning of that wealthy family&rsquo;s
power. The same year the republic purchased Leghorn from
the Genoese for 100,000 florins, and established a body of &ldquo;Consuls
of the Sea&rdquo; to superintend maritime trade. Although
11,000,000 florins had been spent on recent wars Florence continued
prosperous and its trade increased.

In 1421 Filippo Maria Visconti, who had succeeded in reconquering
most of Lombardy, seized ForlÃ¬; this induced the
Florentines to declare war on him, as they regarded his
approach as a menace to their territory in spite of the

opposition of the peace party led by Giovanni de&rsquo;
Medici. The campaign was anything but successful,
and the Florentines were defeated several times, with the result
that their credit was shaken and several important firms failed.
The pope too was against them, but when they induced the
Venetians to intervene the tide of fortune changed, and Visconti
was finally defeated and forced to accept peace on onerous
terms (1427).

The old systems of raising revenue no longer corresponded
to the needs of the republic, and as early as 1336 the various
loans made to the state were consolidated into one

expenditure was met by forced loans (prestanze), but the
method of distribution aroused discontent among the
lower classes, and in 1427 a general catasto or assessment of all
the wealth of the citizens was formed, and measures were devised
to distribute the obligations according to each man&rsquo;s capacity,
so as to avoid pressing too hardly on the poor. The catasto was
largely the work of Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici, who greatly increased
his popularity thereby. He died in 1429.

An attempt to capture Lucca led Florence, in alliance with
Venice, into another costly war with Milan (1432-1433). The
mismanagement of the campaign brought about a
quarrel between the aristocratic party, led by Rinaldo

degli Albizzi, and the popular party, led by Giovanni
de&rsquo; Medici&rsquo;s son Cosimo (1389-1464), although both
had agreed to the war before it began. Rinaldo was
determined to break the Medici party, and succeeded in getting
Cosimo exiled. The Albizzi tried to strengthen their position by
conferring exceptional powers on the capitano del popolo and
by juggling with the election bags, but the Medici still had a
great hold on the populace. Rinaldo&rsquo;s proposal for a coup d&rsquo;Ã©tat
met with no response from his own party, and he failed to prevent
the election of a pro-Medici signory in 1434. He and other leaders
of the party were summoned to the palace to answer a charge of
plotting against the state, to which he replied by collecting 800
armed followers. A revolution was only averted through the
intervention of Pope Eugenius IV., who was then in Florence.
A parlamento was summoned, and the balÃ¬a appointed decreed
536
the return of Cosimo and the exile of Rinaldo degli Albizzi,
Rodolfo Peruzzi, NiccolÃ² Barbadori, and others, in spite of the
feeble attempt of Eugenius to protect them. On the 6th of
October 1434 Cosimo returned to Florence, and for the next
three centuries the history of the city is identified with that of
the house of Medici.2

Cosimo succeeded in dominating the republic while remaining
nominally a private citizen. He exiled those who opposed him,
and governed by means of the balÃ¬e, which, re-elected
every five years, appointed all the magistrates and

acted according to his orders. In 1437 Florence and
Venice were again at war with the Visconti, whose chief captain,
NiccolÃ² Piccinino (q.v.), on entering Tuscany with many Florentine
exiles in his train, was signally defeated at Anghiari by the
Florentines under Francesco Sforza (1440); peace was made the
following year. The system of the catasto, which led to abuses,
was abolished, and a progressive income-tax (decima scalata)
was introduced with the object of lightening the burdens of the
poor, who were as a rule Medicean, at the expense of the rich;
but as it was frequently increased the whole community came
to be oppressed by it in the end. Cosimo increased his own
authority and that of the republic by aiding Francesco Sforza
to become duke of Milan (1450), and he sided with him in the
war against Venice (1452-1454). In 1452 the emperor Frederick
III. passed through Florence on his way to be crowned in Rome,
and was received as a friend. During the last years of Cosimo&rsquo;s
life, affairs were less under his control, and the gonfaloniere Luca
Pitti, a vain and ambitious man, introduced many changes, such
as the abasement of the authority of the podestÃ  and of the
capitano, which Cosimo desired but was glad to attribute to
others.

In 1464 Cosimo died and was succeeded, not without some
opposition, by his son Piero, who was very infirm and gouty.
Various plots against him were hatched, the anti-Medicean
faction being called the Del Poggio party
Piero de&rsquo; Medici (the Gouty).
because the house of its leader Luca Pitti was on a hill,
while the Mediceans were called the Del Piano party
because Piero&rsquo;s house was in the town below; the other opposition
leaders were Dietisalvi Neroni and Agnolo Acciaiuoli. But
Piero&rsquo;s unexpected energy upset the schemes of his enemies.
The death of Sforza led to a war for the succession of Milan,
and the Venetians, instigated by Florentine exiles, invaded
Tuscany. The war ended, after many indecisive engagements,
in 1468, through the intervention of Pope Paul II. Piero died
Lorenzo the Magnificent.
in 1469, leaving two sons, Lorenzo (1449-1492) and
Giuliano (1453-1478). The former at once assumed
the reins of government and became ruler of Florence
in a way neither Cosimo nor Piero had ever attempted;
he established his domination by means of balÃ¬e consisting of the
signory, the accoppiatori, and 240 other members, all Mediceans,
to be renewed every five years (1471). In 1472 a quarrel having
arisen with Volterra on account of a dispute concerning the alum
mines, Lorenzo sent an expedition against the city, which was
sacked and many of the inhabitants massacred. Owing to a
variety of causes an enmity arose between Lorenzo and Pope
Sixtus IV., and the latter, if not an accomplice, at all events
had knowledge of the Pazzi conspiracy against the Medici (1478).
The result of the plot was that, although Giuliano was murdered,
Lorenzo strengthened his position, and put to death or exiled
numbers of his enemies. He was excommunicated by Sixtus,
who, together with King Ferdinand of Naples, waged war against
him; no great successes were registered on either side at first, but
eventually the Florentines were defeated at Poggio Imperiale
(near Poggibonsi) and the city itself was in danger. Lorenzo&rsquo;s
position was critical, but by his boldness in going to Naples he
succeeded in concluding a peace with the king, which led to a
reconciliation with the pope (1479-1480). He was received with
enthusiasm on returning to Florence and became absolute master
of the situation. In April 1480 a balÃ¬a was formed, and its most
important act was the creation at Lorenzo&rsquo;s instance of the
Council of Seventy; it was constituted for five years, but it became
permanent, and all its members were Lorenzo&rsquo;s friends.
From that time until his death the city was free from party strife
under a de facto despotism, but after the Rinuccini conspiracy
of that year the Council of Seventy passed a law declaring
attempts on Lorenzo&rsquo;s life to be high treason. Owing to his
political activity Lorenzo had neglected the business interests
of his firm, and in order to make good certain heavy losses he
seems to have appropriated public funds. His foreign policy,
which was magnificent but expensive, rendered further forced
loans necessary, and he also laid hands on the Monte delle Doti,
an insurance institution to provide dowries for girls.

An attempt by the Venetians to seize Ferrara led to a general
Italian war, in which Florence also took part on the side hostile
to Venice, and when peace was made in 1484 the republic
gained some advantages. The following year a revolt of the
Neapolitan barons against King Ferdinand broke out, actively
supported by Pope Innocent VIII.; Lorenzo remained neutral at
first, but true to his policy of maintaining the balance of power
and not wishing to see Ferdinand completely crushed, he ended
by giving him assistance in spite of the king&rsquo;s unpopularity in
Florence. Peace was made when the pope agreed to come to terms
in 1486, and in 1487 Lorenzo regained Sarzana, which Genoa
had taken from Florence nine years previously. The general disorders
and ceaseless intrigues all over Italy required Lorenzo&rsquo;s
constant attention, and he succeeded in making Florence &ldquo;the

needle of the balance of power in Italy.&rdquo; At this
time the Dominican Fra Girolamo Savonarola (q.v.)
was in Florence and aroused the whole city by his
denunciations of ecclesiastical corruption and also of that
of the Florentines. He opposed Lorenzo&rsquo;s government as the
source of the immorality of the people, and to some extent
influenced public opinion against him. Ill-health now gained on
Lorenzo, and Savonarola, whom he had summoned to his bedside,
refused to give absolution to the destroyer of Florentine liberties.
Lorenzo, during whose rule Florence had become one of the
greatest centres of art and literature in Europe, died in 1492.

He was succeeded by his son Piero, who had none of his father&rsquo;s
capacity and made a number of political blunders. When
Charles VIII. of France came to Italy to conquer Naples
Piero decided to assist the latter kingdom, although the

traditional sympathies of the people were for the French
king, and when Charles entered Florentine territory and captured
Sarzana, Piero went to his camp and asked pardon for opposing
him. The king demanded the cession of Pisa, Leghorn and
other towns, which Piero granted, but on returning to Florence
on the 8th of November 1494 he found the opposition greatly
strengthened and his popularity forfeited, especially when the
news of his disgraceful cessions to Charles became known. He
was refused admittance to the palace, and the people began to
shout &ldquo;Popolo e libertÃ !&rdquo; in opposition to the Medicean cry of
&ldquo;Palle, Palle!&rdquo; (from the Medici arms). With a small escort
he fled from the city, followed soon after by his brother Giovanni.
Expulsion of the Medici (1494).Charles VIII. in Florence.
That same day Pisa rose in revolt against the Florentines,
and was occupied by Charles. The expulsion of
the Medici produced some disorder, but Piero Capponi
(q.v.) and other prominent citizens succeeded in
keeping the peace. Ambassadors, one of whom was Savonarola,
were sent to treat with the French king, but no agreement was
arrived at until Charles entered Florence on the 17th
of November at the head of 12,000 men. In spite of
their French sympathies the citizens were indignant at
the seizure of Sarzana, and while they gave the king
a splendid welcome, they did not like his attitude of conqueror.
Charles was impressed with the wealth and refinement of the
citizens, and above all with the solid fortress-like appearance of
their palaces. The signory appointed Piero Capponi, a man of
great ability and patriotism, and experienced in diplomacy,
the gonfaloniere Francesco Valori, the Dominican Giorgio
Vespucci, and the jurisconsult and diplomatist Domenico Bonsi,

syndics to conduct the negotiations with the French king.
Charles&rsquo;s demands by no means pleased the citizens, and the
arrogance and violence of his soldiers led to riots in which they
were assailed with stones in the narrow streets. When the king
began to hint at the recall of Piero de&rsquo; Medici, whose envoys had
gained his ear, the signory ordered the citizens to be ready to
fly to arms. The proposal was dropped, but Charles demanded
an immense sum of money before he would leave the city; long
discussions followed, and when at last he presented an insolent
ultimatum the syndics refused to accept it. The king said in
Piero Capponi.
a threatening tone, &ldquo;Then we shall sound our
trumpets,&rdquo; whereupon Capponi tore up the document
in his face and replied, &ldquo;And we shall ring our bells.&rdquo;
The king, realizing what street fighting in Florence would mean,
at once came to terms; he contented himself with 120,000
florins, agreeing to assume the title of &ldquo;Protector and Restorer
of the liberty of Florence,&rdquo; and to give up the fortresses he had
taken within two years, unless his expedition to Naples should
be concluded sooner; the Medici were to remain banished, but
the price on their heads was withdrawn. But Charles would not
depart, a fact which caused perpetual disturbance in the city,
and it was not until the 28th of November, after an exhortation
by Savonarola whom he greatly respected, that he left Florence.

It was now intended to re-establish the government on the
basis of the old republican institutions, but it was found that
sixty years of Medici rule had reduced them to mere
shadows, and the condition of the government, largely
The revived republic.Savonarola as a statesman.
controlled by a balÃ¬a of 20 accoppiatori and frequently
disturbed by the summoning of the parlamento, was
utterly chaotic. Consequently men talked of nothing save of
changing the constitution, but unfortunately there was no longer
an upper class accustomed to public affairs, while the lower class
was thoroughly demoralized. Many proposals were made, none
of them of practical value, until Savonarola, who had
already made a reputation as a moral reformer, began
his famous series of political sermons. In the prevailing
confusion the people turned to him as their only hope,
and gradually a new government was evolved, each law being
enacted as the result of his exhortations. A Greater Council
empowered to appoint magistrates and pass laws was formed,
to which all citizens netti di specchio (who had paid their taxes)
and beneficiati (i.e. who had sat in one of the higher magistracies
or whose fathers, grandfathers, or great-grandfathers had done
so) were eligible together with certain others. There were 3200
such citizens, and they sat one-third at a time for six months.
The Greater Council was to elect another council of 80 citizens
over forty years old, also to be changed every six months; this
body, which the signory must consult once a week, together
with the colleges and the signory itself, was to appoint
ambassadors and commissaries of war, and deal with other
confidential matters. The system of forced loans was abolished
and a 10% tax on real property introduced in its stead, and a
law of amnesty for political offenders enacted. Savonarola
also proposed a court of appeal for criminal and political crimes
tried by the Otto di guardia e balÃ¬a; this too was agreed to, but
the right of appeal was to be, not to a court as Savonarola
suggested, but to the Greater Council, a fact which led to grave
abuses, as judicial appeals became subject to party passions.
The parlamenti were abolished and a monte di pietÃ  to advance
money at reasonable interest was created. But in spite of
Savonarola&rsquo;s popularity there was a party called the Bigi
(greys) who intrigued secretly in favour of the return of the
Medici, while the men of wealth, called the Arrabbiati, although
they hated the Medici, were even more openly opposed to the
actual rÃ©gime and desired to set up an aristocratic oligarchy.
The adherents of Savonarola were called the Piagnoni, or
snivellers, while the Neutrali changed sides frequently.

A league between the pope, the emperor, Venice and Spain
having been made against Charles VIII., the latter was forced
to return to France. On his way back he passed through

league, it believed itself in danger, as Piero de&rsquo; Medici was in the
king&rsquo;s train. Savonarola was again sent to the French camp,
and his eloquence turned the king from any idea he may have
had of reinstating the Medici. At the same time
Charles violated his promise by giving aid to the Pisans
in their revolt against Florence, and did not restore the
other fortresses. After the French had abandoned
Italy, Piero de&rsquo; Medici, encouraged by the league, enlisted a
number of mercenaries and marched on Florence, but the
citizens, fired by Savonarola&rsquo;s enthusiasm, flew to arms and
prepared for an energetic resistance; owing to Piero&rsquo;s incapacity
and the exhaustion of his funds the expedition came to nothing.
At the same time the conditions of the city were not prosperous;
its resources were strained by the sums paid to Charles and by
the war; its credit was shaken, its trade paralysed, famine and
plague visited the city, and the war to subjugate Pisa was proceeding
unsatisfactorily. Worse still was the death in 1496 of
one of its ablest and most disinterested statesmen, Piero Capponi.
The league now attacked Florence, for Pope Alexander VI.

hated Savonarola and was determined to destroy
the republic, so as to reinstate the Medici temporarily
and prepare the way for his own sons; the Venetians
and Imperialists besieged Leghorn, and there was
great misery in Florence. All this decreased Savonarola&rsquo;s
popularity to some extent, but the enemy having been beaten
at Leghorn and the league being apparently on the point of
breaking up, the Florentines took courage and the friar&rsquo;s party
was once more in the ascendant. Numerous processions were
held, Savonarola&rsquo;s sermons against corruption and vice seemed
to have temporarily transformed the citizens, and the carnival
of 1497 remained famous for the burning of the &ldquo;vanities&rdquo; (i.e.
indecent books and pictures and carnival masks and costumes).
The friar&rsquo;s sermons against ecclesiastical corruption, and especially
against the pope, resulted in his excommunication by the
latter, in consequence of which he lost much of his influence
and immorality spread once more. That same year Piero made
another unsuccessful attempt on Florence. New Medici plots
having been discovered, Bernardo del Nero and other prominent
citizens were tried and put to death; but the party hostile
to Savonarola gained ground and had the support of the
Franciscans, who were hostile to the Dominican order. Pulpit
warfare was waged between Savonarola and his opponents, and
the matter ended in his being forbidden to preach and in a proposed
ordeal by fire, which, however, never came off. The pope
again and again demanded that the friar be surrendered to him,
but without success, in spite of his threats of an interdict against
the city. The Piagnoni were out of power, and a signory of
Arrabbiati having been elected in 1498, a mob of Savonarola&rsquo;s
opponents attacked the convent of St Mark where he resided,
and he himself was arrested and imprisoned. The commission
appointed to try him on charges of heresy and treason was composed

of his enemies, including Doffo Spini, who had
previously attempted to murder him; many irregularities
were committed during the three trials, and
the prisoner was repeatedly tortured. The outgoing
signory secured the election of another which was of
their way of thinking, and on the 22nd of May 1498 Savonarola
was condemned to death and executed the following day.

The pope having been satisfied, the situation in Florence
was less critical for the moment. The war against Pisa was
renewed, and in 1499 the city might have been taken but for
the dilatory tactics of the Florentine commander Paolo Vitelli,
who was consequently arrested on a charge of treason and put
to death. Louis XII. of France, who now sent an army into
Italy to conquer the Milanese, obtained the support of the
Florentines. Cesare Borgia, who had seized many cities in
Romagna, suddenly demanded the reinstatement of the Medici
in Florence, and the danger was only warded off by appointing
him captain-general of the Florentine forces at a large salary
(1501). The weakness of the government becoming every
day more apparent, several constitutional changes were made,
and many old institutions, such as that of the podestÃ  and
capitano del popolo, were abolished; finally in 1502, in order
538
to give more stability to the government, the office of gonfaloniere,
with the right of proposing laws to the signory, was made a life
appointment. The election fell on Piero Soderini (1448-1522),

an honest public-spirited man of no particular party,
but lacking in strength of character. One useful
measure which he took was the institution of a national
militia at the suggestion of NiccolÃ² Machiavelli (1505). In the
meanwhile the Pisan war dragged on without much headway
being made. In 1503 both Piero de&rsquo; Medici and Alexander VI.
had died, eliminating two dangers to the republic. Spain, who
was at war with France over the partition of Naples, helped the
Pisans as the enemies of Florence, France&rsquo;s ally (1501-1504),
but when the war was over the Florentines were able to lay
siege to Pisa (1507), and in 1509 the city was driven by famine
to surrender and became a dependency of Florence once more.

Pope Julius II., after having formed the league of Cambrai
with France and Spain against Venice, retired from it in 1510,
and raised the cry of &ldquo;Fuori i Barbari&rdquo; (out with the
barbarians), with a view to expelling the French from

Italy. King Louis thereupon proposed an oecumenical
council so as to create a schism in the Church, and
demanded that it be held in Florentine territory. After
some hesitation the republic agreed to the demand, and the council
was opened at Pisa, whereupon the pope immediately placed
Florence under an interdict. At the request of the Florentines
the council removed to Milan, but this did not save them from
the pope&rsquo;s wrath. A Spanish army under Raymundo de Cardona
and accompanied by Cardinal Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici and his brother
Giuliano entered the republic&rsquo;s territory and demanded 100,000
florins, the dismissal of Soderini, and the readmission of the
Medici. Soderini offered to resign, but the Greater Council
supported him and preparations for defence were made. In
August the Spaniards took Prato by storm and committed
hideous atrocities on the inhabitants; Florence was in a panic,
a group of the Ottimati, or nobles, forced Soderini to resign and
leave the city, and Cardona&rsquo;s new terms were accepted, viz.
the readmission of the Medici, a fine of 150,000 florins, and an

alliance with Spain. On the 1st of September 1512
Giuliano and Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici, and their nephew
Lorenzo, entered Florence with the Spanish troops;
a parlamento was summoned, and a packed balÃ¬a
formed which abolished the Greater Council and created a constitution
similar to that of Lorenzo the Magnificent. Giuliano
became de facto head of the government, but he did not pursue
the usual vindictive policy of his house, although he resorted
to the Laurentian method of amusing the citizens with splendid
festivities. In 1513, on the death of Julius II., Giovanni de&rsquo;
Medici was elected pope as Leo X., an event which greatly enhanced
the importance of the house. In March 1514 Giuliano
died, and was succeeded by Lorenzo, who was also created duke
of Urbino. At his death in 1519 Cardinal Giulio de&rsquo; Medici (son
of the Giuliano murdered in the Pazzi conspiracy) took charge
of the government; he met with some opposition and had to
play off the Ottimati against the Piagnoni, but he did not rule
badly and maintained at all events the outward forms of freedom.
In 1523 he was created pope as Clement VII. and sent his relatives
Ippolito and Alessandro, both minors and bastards, to Florence
under the tutorship of Cardinal Silvio Passerini. Ippolito was
styled the Magnifico and destined to be ruler of the republic,
but Cardinal Passerini&rsquo;s regency proved most unpopular, and the
city was soon seething with discontent. Revolts broke out and
Passerini showed himself quite unequal to coping with the
situation. The Ottimati were mostly anti-Medicean, and by 1527
the position was untenable. When Filippo Strozzi, and above

all his wife, threw their influence in the scales against
the Medici, and the magistrates declared for their expulsion
from power, Passerini, Ippolito and Alessandro
left Florence (17th of May 1527). A Consiglio
degli Scelti was summoned, and a constitution similar
to that of Savonarola&rsquo;s time was established. The Greater
Council was revived and NiccolÃ² Capponi created gonfaloniere
for a year. But Florence was torn by factions&mdash;the Ottimati
who desired an oligarchy, the Palleschi or Mediceans who generally
supported them, the Adirati who opposed Capponi for his
moderation, the Arrabbiati who were strongly anti-Medicean,
and the Popolani who opposed the Ottimati. &ldquo;It is almost
impossible that a state so disorganized and corrupt as Florence
then was should produce men of parts and character, but if by
chance any such should arise they would be hated and persecuted,
their dispositions would be soured by indignation, or they
would be hunted from their country or die of grief&rdquo; (Benedette
Varchi). Capponi did his best to reform the city and save the
situation, and while adopting Savonarola&rsquo;s tone in internal
affairs, he saw the dangers in the foreign situation, realizing that
a reconciliation between the pope and the emperor Charles V.
would prove disastrous for Florence, for Clement would certainly
seize the opportunity to reinstate his family in power. Having
been re-elected gonfaloniere in spite of much opposition in 1528,
Capponi tried to make peace with the pope, but his correspondence
with the Vatican resulted in a quite unjustified charge of high
treason, and although acquitted he had to resign office and leave
the city for six months. Francesco Carducci was elected gonfaloniere
in his place, and on the 29th of June 1529 the pope and
the emperor concluded a treaty by which the latter agreed to
re-establish the Medici in Florence. Carducci made preparations
for a siege, but a large part of the people were against him,
either from Medicean sympathies or fear, although the Frateschi,
as the believers in Savonarola&rsquo;s views were called, supported
him strongly. A body called the Nove della Milizia, of whom
Michelangelo Buonarroti was a member, was charged with the
defence of the city, and Michelangelo (q.v.) himself superintended
the strengthening of the fortifications. A most unfortunate
choice for the chief command of the army was the appointment
of Malatesta Baglioni. In August an imperial army under
Philibert, prince of Orange, advanced on the city. In September
Malatesta surrendered Perugia, and other cities fell before the
Imperialists. All attempts to come to terms with the pope were

unsuccessful, and by October the siege had begun.
Although alone against papacy and empire, the citizens
showed the greatest spirit and devotion, and were
successful in many sorties. The finest figure produced
by these events was that of Francesco Ferruccio (q.v.); by his
defence of Empoli he showed himself a first-class soldier, and
was appointed commissioner-general. He executed many rapid
marches and counter-marches, assaulting isolated bodies of the
enemy unexpectedly, and harassing them continually. But
Malatesta was a traitor at heart and hindered the defence of
the city in every way. Ferruccio, who had recaptured Volterra,
marched to Gavinana above Pistoia to attack the Imperialists in
the rear. A battle took place at that spot on the 3rd of August,
but in spite of Ferruccio&rsquo;s heroism he was defeated and killed;
the prince of Orange also fell in that desperate engagement.
Malatesta contributed to the defeat by preventing a simultaneous
attack by the besieged. The sufferings from famine within the
city were now very great, and an increasingly large part of the
people favoured surrender. The signory, at last realizing that
Malatesta was a traitor, dismissed him; but it was too late,
and he now behaved as though he were governor of Florence;
when the troops attempted to enforce the dismissal he turned
his guns on them. On the 9th of August the signory saw that

all hope was lost and entered into negotiations with Don
Ferrante Gonzaga, the new imperial commander.
On the 12th the capitulation was signed: Florence
was to pay an indemnity of 80,000 florins, the Medici
were to be recalled, the emperor was to establish the new government,
&ldquo;it being understood that liberty is to be preserved.&rdquo;
Baccio Valori, a Medicean who had been in the imperialist camp,
now took charge, and the city was occupied by foreign troops.
A parlamento was summoned, the usual packed balÃ¬a created, and
all opposition silenced. The city was given over to Pope Clement,
who, disregarding the terms of the capitulation, had Carducci
and Girolami (the last gonfaloniere) hanged, and established
Alessandro de&rsquo; Medici, the natural son of Lorenzo, duke of Urbino,
as head of the republic on the 5th of July 1531. The next year
539
the signory was abolished, Alessandro created gonfaloniere for
life, and his lordship made hereditary in his family by imperial
patent. Thus Florence lost her liberty, and came to be the capital
of the duchy (afterwards grand-duchy) of Tuscany (see Tuscany).

The Medici dynasty ruled in Tuscany until the death of Gian
Gastone in 1737, when the grand-duchy was assigned to Francis,
duke of Lorraine. But it was governed by a regency
until 1753, when it was conferred by the empress

Maria Theresa on his son Peter Leopold. During the
Napoleonic wars the grand-duke Ferdinand III. of
Habsburg-Lorraine was driven from the throne, and Tuscany
was annexed to the French empire in 1808. In 1809 Florence
was made capital of the kingdom of Etruria, but after the fall of
Napoleon in 1814 Ferdinand was reinstated. He died in 1833,
and was succeeded by Leopold II. In 1848 there was a liberal
revolutionary movement in Florence, and Leopold granted a
constitution. But civil disorders followed, and in 1849 the grand-duke
returned under an Austrian escort. In 1859, after the
Franco-Italian victories over the Austrians in Lombardy, by a
bloodless revolution in Florence Leopold was expelled and
Tuscany annexed to the Sardinian kingdom.

In 1865 Florence became the capital of the kingdom of Italy,
but after the occupation of Rome in 1870 during the
Franco-Prussian war, the capital was transferred to the Eternal City
(1871).

FLORES, an island in the Atlantic Ocean, belonging to
Portugal, and forming part of the Azores archipelago. Pop.
(1900) 8137; area, 57 sq. m. Flores and the adjacent island
of Corvo (pop. 806; area, 7 sq. m.) constitute the westernmost
group of the Azores, and seem but imperfectly to belong to the
archipelago, from the rest of which they are widely severed.
They lie also out of the usual track of navigators; but to those
who, missing their course, are led thither, Flores affords good
shelter in its numerous bays. Its poultry is excellent; and the
cattle are numerous, but small. It derives its name from the
abundance of the flowers that find shelter in its deep ravines. Its
capital is Santa Cruz das Flores (2247). In 1591 Flores was the
station of the English fleet before the famous sea fight between
Sir R. Grenville&rsquo;s ship &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; and a Spanish fleet of 53
vessels. See Azores.



FLORES, an island of the Dutch East Indies, a member of
the chain extending east of Java. Its length is 224 m., its greatest
breadth 37 m., and its area 5850 sq. m. The existence of slate,
chalk, and sandstone, eruptive rock, volcanoes and heights
stretching west and east, indicates a similar structure to that of
the other islands of the chain. Several volcanoes are active.
Among the loftier summits are, on the south coast, Gunong
Rokka (7940 ft.) and Keo (6560 ft.); with the lesser but constantly
active Gunong Api, forming a peninsula; and at the
south-east, Lobetobi (7120 ft.). The thickly wooded interior
is little explored. The coasts have deep bays and extensive
rounded gulfs, where are situated the principal villages (kampongs).
On the north coast are Bari, Reo, Maumer and Geliting;
on the east, Larantuka; and on the south, Sikka and Endeh.
The rivers, known only at their mouths, seem to be unnavigable.
The mean temperature is 77Â° to 80Â° F., and the yearly rainfall
43 to 47 in. For administrative purposes the island is divided
into West Flores (Mangerai), attached to the government
of Celebes, and Middle and East Flores (Larantuka and dependencies),
attached to the residency of Timor. The population
is estimated at 250,000. The people live by trade, fishing,
salt-making, shipbuilding, and the cultivation of rice, maize,
and palms in the plain, but there is little industry or commerce.
Some edible birds&rsquo; nests, rice, sandalwood and cinnamon are
exported to Celebes and elsewhere. The inhabitants of the
coast-districts are mainly of Malay origin. The aborigines,
who occupy the interior, are of Papuan stock. They are tall
and well-built, with dark or black skins. The hair is frizzly.
They are pure savages; their only religion is a kind of nature-worship.
They consider the earth holy and inviolable; thus
in severe droughts they only dig the river-beds for water as a
last resource. Portugal claimed certain portions of the island
until 1859.



FLOREZ, ENRIQUE (1701-1773), Spanish historian, was
born at Valladolid on the 14th of February 1701. In his fifteenth
year he entered the order of St Augustine, was afterwards
professor of theology at the university of Alcala, and published
a Cursus theologiae in five volumes (1732-1738). He afterwards
devoted himself to historical studies. Of these the first-fruit
was his Clave Historial, a work of the same class as the French
Art de vÃ©rifier les dates, and preceding it by several years. It
appeared in 1743, and passed through many editions. In 1747
was published the first volume of EspaÃ±a Sagrada, teatro geografico-historico
de la Iglesia de EspaÃ±a, a vast compilation of Spanish
ecclesiastical history which obtained a European reputation,
and of which twenty-nine volumes appeared in the author&rsquo;s
lifetime. It was continued after his death by Manuel Risco
and others, and further additions have been made at the expense
of the Spanish government. The whole work in fifty-one volumes
was published at Madrid (1747-1886). Its value is considerably
increased by the insertion of ancient chronicles and documents
not easily accessible elsewhere. Florez was a good numismatist,
and published Medallas de las Colonias in 2 vols. (1757-1758), of
which a third volume appeared in 1773. His last work was the
Memorias de las reynas Catolicas, 2 vols. (1770). Florez led a
retired, studious and unambitious life, and died at Madrid
on the 20th of August 1773.

FLORIAN, SAINT, a martyr honoured in Upper Austria. In
the 8th century Puoche was mentioned as the place of his tomb,
and on the site was built the celebrated monastery of canons
regular, St Florian, which still exists. His Acta are of considerable
antiquity, but devoid of historical value. Their substance
is borrowed from the Acta of St Irenaeus of Sirmium. The cult
of St Florian was introduced into Poland, together with the
relics of the saint, which were brought thither in 1183 by Giles,
bishop of Modena. Casimir, duke of Poland, dedicated a church
at Cracow to him. He is represented in various ways, especially
as a warrior holding in his hand a vessel from which he pours
out flames. His protection is often sought against fire. His
day in the calendar is the 4th of May.

FLORIAN, JEAN PIERRE CLARIS DE (1755-1794), French
poet and romance writer, was born on the 6th of March 1755 at
the chÃ¢teau of Florian, near Sauve, in the department of Gard.
His mother, a Spanish lady named Gilette de Salgues, died when
he was quite a child. His uncle and guardian, the marquis of
Florian, who had married a niece of Voltaire, introduced him at
Ferney and in 1768 he became page at Anet in the household of
the duke of PenthiÃ¨vre, who remained his friend throughout his
life. Having studied for some time at the artillery school at
Bapaume he obtained from his patron a captain&rsquo;s commission
in a dragoon regiment, and in this capacity it is said he displayed
540
a boisterous behaviour quite incongruous with the gentle,
meditative character of his works. On the outbreak of the
French Revolution he retired to Sceaux, but he was soon discovered
and imprisoned; and though his imprisonment was short
he survived his release only a few months, dying on the 13th
of September 1794.

Florian&rsquo;s first literary efforts were comedies; his verse epistle
Voltaire et le serf du Mont Jura and an eclogue Ruth were crowned
by the French Academy in 1782 and 1784 respectively. In
1782 also he produced a one-act prose comedy, Le Bon MÃ©nage,
and in the next year GalatÃ©e, a romantic tale in imitation of the
Galatea of Cervantes. Other short tales and comedies followed,
and in 1786 appeared Numa Pompilius, an undisguised imitation
of FÃ©nelon&rsquo;s TÃ©lÃ©maque. In 1788 he became a member of the
French Academy, and published Estelle, a pastoral of the same
class as GalatÃ©e. Another romance, Gonzalve de Cordoue, preceded
by an historical notice of the Moors, appeared in 1791,
and his famous collection of Fables in 1792. Among his posthumous
works are La Jeunesse de Florian, ou MÃ©moires d&rsquo;un jeune
Espagnol (1807), and an abridgment (1799) of Don Quixote,
which, though far from being a correct representation of the
original, had great and merited success.

Florian imitated Salomon Gessner, the Swiss idyllist, and his
style has all the artificial delicacy and sentimentality of the
Gessnerian school. Perhaps the nearest example of the class
in English literature is afforded by John Wilson&rsquo;s (Christopher
North&rsquo;s) Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life. Among the best
of his fables are reckoned &ldquo;The Monkey showing the Magic
Lantern,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Blind Man and the Paralytic,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Monkeys and the Leopard.&rdquo;


The best edition of Florian&rsquo;s &OElig;uvres complÃ¨tes appeared in Paris
in 16 volumes, 1820; his &OElig;uvres inÃ©dites in 4 volumes, 1824.

FLORIANOPOLIS (formerly Desterro, Nossa Senhora do
Desterro and Santa Catharina, and still popularly known under
the last designation), a city and port of Brazil and the capital
of the state of Santa Catharina, on the western or inside shore
of a large island of the same name, 485 m. S.S.W. of Rio de Janeiro,
in 27Â° 30&prime; S., 48Â° 30&prime; W. Pop. (1890) 11,400, including many
Germans; (1902, estimate) 16,000; of the municipality, including
a large rural district and several villages (1890), 30,687.
The harbour is formed by the widening of the strait separating
the island from the mainland, which is nearly 2 m. wide at this
point. It is approached by narrow entrances from the N. and
S., which are defended by small forts. The island is mountainous
and wooded, and completely shelters the harbour from easterly
storms. The surroundings are highly picturesque and tropical
in character, but the town itself is poorly built and unattractive.
Its public buildings include the president&rsquo;s official residence,
arsenal, lyceum, hospital and some old churches. The climate
is warm for the latitude, but the higher elevations of the vicinity
are noted for their mild climate and healthfulness. There are
some German colonies farther up the coast whose products find
a market here, and a number of small settlements along the
mainland coast add something to the trade of the town. The
more distant inland towns are partly supplied from this point,
but difficult mountain roads tend to restrict the trade greatly.
There is a considerable trade in market produce with Rio de
Janeiro, but the exports are inconsiderable. Santa Catharina
was formerly one of the well-known whaling stations of the
South Atlantic, and is now a secondary military and naval
station.

The island of Santa Catharina was originally settled by the
Spanish; Cabeza de Vaca landed here in 1542 and marched
hence across country to Asuncion, Paraguay. The Spanish
failed to establish a permanent colony, however, and the Portuguese
took possession. The island was captured by a Spanish
expedition under Viceroy Zeballos in 1777. A boundary treaty
of that same year restored it to Portugal. In 1894 Santa
Catharina fell into the possession of revolutionists against the
government of President Floriano Peixoto. With the collapse
of the revolution the city was occupied by the government forces,
and its name was then changed to Florianopolis in honour of the
president of the republic.



FLORIDA, the most southern of the United States of America,
situated between 24Â° 30&prime; and 31Â° N. lat. and 79Â° 48&prime; and 87Â° 38&prime;
W. long. It is bounded N. by Georgia and Alabama, E. by the
Atlantic Ocean, S. by the Strait of Florida, which separates it
from Cuba, and by the Gulf of Mexico, and W. by Alabama
and the Gulf. The Florida Keys, a chain of islands extending
in a general south-westerly direction from Biscayne Bay, are
included in the state boundaries, and the city of Key West, on
an island of the same name, is the seat of justice of Monroe
county. The total area of the state is 58,666 sq. m., of which
3805 sq. m. are water surface. The coast line is greater than that
of any other state, extending 472 m. on the Atlantic and 674 m.
on the Gulf Coast.

The peculiar outline of Florida gives it the name of &ldquo;Peninsula
State.&rdquo; The average elevation of the surface of the state above
the sea-level is less than that of any other state except Louisiana,
but there is not the monotony of unbroken level which descriptions
and maps often suggest. The N.W. portion of the state
is, topographically, similar to south-eastern Alabama, being a
rolling, hilly country; the eastern section is a part of the Atlantic
coastal plain; the western coast line is less regular than the
eastern, being indented by a number of bays and harbours,
the largest of which are Charlotte Harbour, Tampa Bay and
Pensacola Bay. Along much of the western coast and along
nearly the whole of the eastern coast extends a line of sand
reefs and narrow islands, enclosing shallow and narrow bodies
of water, such as Indian river and Lake Worth&mdash;called rivers,
lakes, lagoons, bays and harbours. In the central part of the
state there is a ridge, extending N. and S. and forming a divide,
separating the streams of the east coast from those of the west.
Its highest elevation above sea-level is about 300 ft. The central
region is remarkable for its large number of lakes, approximately
30,000 between Gainesville in Alachua county, and Lake Okeechobee.
They are due largely to sinkholes or depressions caused
by solution of the limestone of the region. Many of the lakes
are connected by subterranean channels, and a change in the
surface of one lake is often accompanied by a change in the
surface of another. By far the largest of these lakes, nearly
all of them shallow, is Lake Okeechobee, a body of water about
1250 sq. m. in area and almost uniformly shallow, its depth
seldom being greater than 15 ft. Caloosahatchee river, flowing
into the Gulf of Mexico near Charlotte Harbour, is its principal
outlet. Among the other lakes are Orange, Crescent, George,
Weir, Harris, Eustis, Apopka, Tohopekaliga, Kissimmee and
Istokpoga. The chief feature of the southern portion of the state
is the Everglades (q.v.), the term &ldquo;Everglade State&rdquo; being
popularly applied to Florida. Within the state there are many
swamps, the largest of which are the Big Cypress Swamp in the
S. adjoining the Everglades on the W., and Okefinokee Swamp,
extending from Georgia into the N.E. part of the state.


A peculiar feature of the drainage of the state is the large number
of subterranean streams and of springs, always found to a greater or
less extent in limestone regions. Some of them are of great size.
Silver Spring and Blue Spring in Marion county, Blue Spring and
Orange City Mineral Spring in Volusia county, Chipola Spring near
Marianna in Jackson county, Espiritu Santo Spring near Tampa
in Hillsboro county, Magnolia Springs in Clay county, Suwanee
Springs in Suwanee county, White Sulphur Springs in Hamilton
county, the Wekiva Springs in Orange county, and Wakulla Spring,
Newport Sulphur Spring and Panacea Mineral Spring in Wakulla
county are the most noteworthy. Many of the springs have curative
properties, one of them, the Green Cove Spring in Clay county,
discharging about 3000 gallons of sulphuretted water per minute.
Not far from St Augustine a spring bursts through the sea itself with
such force that the ocean breakers roll back from it as from a sunken
reef. The springs often merge into lakes, and lake systems are
usually the sources of the rivers, Lake George being the principal
source of the St Johns, and Lake Kissimmee of the Kissimmee,
while a number of smaller lakes are the source of the Oklawaha, one
of the most beautiful of the Floridian rivers.

Of the rivers the most important are the St Johns, which
flows N. from about the middle of the peninsula, empties into
the Atlantic a short distance below Jacksonville, and is navigable
for about 250 m. from its mouth, the Withlacoochee, flowing
in a general north-westerly direction from its source in the N.E.
part of Polk county, and forming near its entrance into the Gulf
of Mexico the boundary between Levy and Citrus counties, and
four rivers, the Escambia, the Choctawatchee, the Apalachicola,
and the Suwanee, having their sources in other states and
traversing the north-western part of Florida. On account of
its sand reefs, the east coast has not so many harbours as the
west coast. The most important harbours are at Fernandina,
St Augustine, and Miami on the E. coast, and at Tampa, Key
West and Pensacola on the W. coast.


The soils of Florida have sand as a common ingredient.1 They
may be divided into three classes: the pine lands, which often have
a surface of dark vegetable mould, under which is a sandy loam
resting on a substratum of clay, marl or limestone&mdash;areas of such
soil are found throughout the state; the &ldquo;hammocks,&rdquo; which have
soil of similar ingredients and are interspersed with the pine lands&mdash;large
areas of this soil occur in Levy, Alachua, Citrus, Hernando,
Pasco, Gadsden, Leon, Madison, Jefferson and Jackson counties;
and the alluvial swamp lands, chiefly in E. and S. Florida, the richest
class, which require drainage to fit them for cultivation.


As regards climate Florida may be divided into three more
or less distinct zones. North and west of a line passing through
Cedar Keys and Fernandina the climate is distinctly &ldquo;southern,&rdquo;
similar to that of the Gulf states; from this line to another
extending from the mouth of the Caloosahatchee to Indian
river inlet the climate is semi-tropical, and is well suited to the
cultivation of oranges; S. of this the climate is sub-tropical,
well adapted to the cultivation of pineapples. Since the semi-tropical
and sub-tropical zones are nearer the course of the
Gulf Stream, and are swept by the trade winds, their temperatures
are more uniform than those of the zones of southern
climate; indeed, the extremes of heat (103Â° F.) and cold (13Â° F.)
are felt in the region of southern climate. The mean annual
temperature of the state is 70.8Â° F., greater in the sub-tropical
than in the other climate zones, and the Atlantic coast is in
general warmer than the Gulf Coast. The rainfall averages
52.09 in. per annum. On account of its warm climate, Florida
has many resorts for health and pleasure, which are especially
popular in the season from January to April; the more
important are St Augustine, Ormond, Daytona, Palm Beach,
Miami, Tampa, White Springs, Hampton Springs, Worthington
Springs and Orange Springs.


No metals have ever been discovered in Florida. The principal
minerals are rock phosphate and (recently more important) land and
river pebble phosphate, found in scattered deposits in a belt on the
&ldquo;west coast&rdquo; about 30 m. wide and extending from Tallahassee to
Lake Okeechobee. The centre of the quarries is Dunnellon in
Marion county, and pebble phosphate is found in Hillsboro, Polk,
De Soto, Osceola, Citrus and Hernando counties. Although the
economic value of the phosphate deposits was first realized about
1889, between 1894 and 1907 Florida produced, each year, more
than half of all the phosphate rock produced in the whole United
States, the yield of Florida (1,357,365 long tons) in 1907 being
valued at $6,577,757; that of the whole country at $10,653,558.
Florida is also the principal source in the United States for fuller&rsquo;s
earth, a deposit of which, near Quincy, was first discovered in 1893;
and clay (including kaolin) is also mined to some extent. Other
minerals that have been discovered but have not been industrially
developed are gypsum, lignite and cement rock. The lack of a
thorough geological survey has perhaps prevented the discovery
of other minerals&mdash;certainly it is responsible for a late recognition
of the economic value of the known mineral resources.

The flora of N. Florida is similar to that of south-eastern North
America; that of S. Florida seems to be a link between the vegetation
of North America and that of South America and the West Indies,
for out of 247 species of S. Florida that have been examined, 187
are common to the West Indies, Mexico and South America. The
forests cover approximately 37,700 sq. m., chiefly in the northern
part of the state, including about half of the peninsula, yellow pine
being predominant, except in the coastal marsh lands, where cypress,
found throughout the state, particularly abounds. About half of
the varieties of forest trees in the United States are found, and
among the peculiar species are the red bay or &ldquo;Florida Mahogany,&rdquo;
satinwood and cachibou, and the Florida yew and savin, both
almost extinct. The lumber industry is important: in 1905 the
total factory product of lumber and timber was valued at
$10,901,650, and lumber and planing mill products were valued
at $1,690,455. In 1900 this was the most valuable industry in
the state; in 1905 it was second to the manufacture of tobacco.
The fauna is similar in general to that of the southern United States.
Among the animals are the puma, manatee (sea cow), alligator and
crocodile, but the number of these has been greatly diminished by
hunting. Ducks, wild turkeys, bears and wild cats (lynx) are found,
but in decreasing numbers.

The fisheries are very valuable; the total number of species of
fish in Florida waters is about 600, and many species found on
one coast are not found on the other. The king fish and tarpon are
hunted for sport, while mullet, shad, redsnappers, pompano, trout,
sheepshead and Spanish mackerel are of great economic value.
The sponge and oyster fisheries are also important. The total
product of the fisheries in 1902 was valued at about $2,000,000.


Industry and Commerce.&mdash;The principal occupation is agriculture,
in which 44% of the labouring population was engaged
in 1900, but only 12.6% of the total land surface was enclosed
in farms, of which only 34.6% was improved, and the total
agricultural product for 1899 was valued at $18,309,104. As
the number of farms increased faster than the cultivated area
from 1850 to 1900, the average size of farms declined from 444
acres in 1860 to 140 in 1880 and to 106.9 in 1900, the largest
class of farms being those with an acreage varying from 20 to
50 acres. Nearly three-fourths of the farms, in 1900, were
cultivated by their owners, but the cash tenantry system showed
an increase of 100% since 1890, being most extensively used
in the cotton counties. One-third of the farms were operated by
negroes, but one-half of these farms were rented, and the value
of negro farm property was only one-eighth that of the entire
farm property of the state. According to the state census of
1905 only 1,621,362 acres were improved; of 45,984 farms,
31,233 were worked by whites.

Fruits normally form the principal crop; the total value for
1907-8 of the fruit crops of the state (including oranges, lemons,
limes, grape-fruit, bananas, guavas, pears, peaches, grapes,
figs, pecans, &amp;c.) was $6,160,299, according to the report of
the State Department of Agriculture. The discovery of Florida&rsquo;s
adaptability to the culture of oranges about 1875 may be taken
as the beginning of the state&rsquo;s modern industrial development.
But the unusual severity of the winters of 1887, 1894 and 1899
(the report of the Twelfth Census which gives the figures for
this year being therefore misleading) destroyed three-fourths of
the orange trees, and caused an increased attention to stock-raising,
and to various agricultural products. Orange culture
has recovered much of its importance, but it is carried on in
the more southern counties of the state. The cultivation of
pineapples, in sub-tropical Florida, is proving successful, the
product far surpassing that of California, the only other state
in the Union in which pineapples are grown. Grape-fruit, guavas
and lemons are also successfully produced in this part of the
state. The cultivation of strawberries and vegetables (cabbage,
cauliflower, beets, beans, tomatoes, egg-plant, cucumbers,
water-melons, celery, &amp;c.) for northern markets, and of orchard
fruits, especially plums, pears and prunes, has likewise proved
successful. In 1907-8, according to the State Department of
Agriculture, the total value of vegetable and garden products
was $3,928,657. In 1903, according to the statistics of the
United States Department of Agriculture, Indian corn ranked
next to fruits (as given in the state reports), but its product
as compared with that of various other states is unimportant&mdash;in
1907 it amounted to 7,017,000 bushels only; rice is the only
other cereal whose yield in 1899 was greater than that of 1889,
but the Florida product was surpassed (in 1899) by that of the
Carolinas, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas; in 1907 the product
of rice in Florida (69,000 bushels) was less than that of Texas,
Louisiana, South Carolina, Arkansas and Georgia severally.
Tobacco culture, which declined after 1860 on account of the
competition of Cuba and Sumatra, has revived since 1885
through the introduction of Cuban and Sumatran seed; the
product of 1907 (6,937,500 &#8468;) was more than six times that of
542
1899, the product in 1899 (1,125,600 &#8468;) being more than
twice that of 1889 (470,443 &#8468;), which in turn was more
than twenty times that for 1880 (21,182 &#8468;)&mdash;the smallest
production recorded for many decades. In 1907 the average
farm price of tobacco was 45 cents per &#8468; higher than that of
any other state. In 1899, 84% of the product was raised in
Gadsden county. The sweet potato and pea-nut crops have also
become very valuable; on the other hand the Census of 1900
showed a decline in acreage and production of cotton. In 1907
the acreage (265,000 acres) was less than in any cotton-growing
state except Missouri and Virginia; the crop for 1907-1908
was 49,794 bales. Sea-island cotton of very high grade is grown
in Alachua county. The production of sugar, begun by the
early Spanish settlers, declined, but that of syrup increased.
Pecan nuts are a promising crop, and many groves were planted
after 1905. In 1900 there were more than 1,900,000 acres of
land in the state unoccupied. The low lands of the South are
being drained partly by the state and partly by private companies.
Irrigation, introduced in 1888 by the orange growers, has been
adopted by other farmers, especially the tobacco-growers of
Gadsden county, and so the evil effects of the droughts, so common
from February to June, are avoided. The value of farm property
in the southern counties, which have been developed very
recently, shows a steady increase, that of Hillsboro county
surpassing the other counties of the state. In 1907-8, according
to the state Department of Agriculture, the total value of all
field crops (cotton, cereals, sugar-cane, hay and forage, sweet
potatoes, &amp;c.) was $11,856,340, and the total value of all farm
products (including live stock, $20,817,804, poultry and products,
$1,688,433, and dairy products, $1,728,642) was $46,371,320.


The manufactures of Florida, as compared with those of other
states, are unimportant. Their product in 1900 was more than twice
the product in 1890, and the product in 1905 (from establishments
under the factory system only) was $50,298,290, i.e. 47.1%
greater than in 1900. The most important industries were those
that depended upon the forests, their product amounting to nearly
45% of the entire manufactured product of the state. The lumber
and timber products were valued in 1905 at $10,901,650, almost
twice their valuation in 1890, and an increase of 1.2% over the
product of 1900. The manufacture of turpentine and rosin, material
for which is obtained from the pine forests, had increased greatly
in importance between 1890 and 1900, the product in 1890 being
valued at only $191,859, that of 1900 at $6,469,605, and from the
latter sum it increased in 1905 to $9,901,905, an increase of more
than one-half. In 1900 the state ranked second and in 1905 first
of all the states of the country in the value of this product; in 1905
the state&rsquo;s product amounted to 41.4% of that of the entire country.
The manufacture of cigars and cigarettes (almost entirely of cigars,
few cigarettes being manufactured), carried on chiefly by Cubans
at Key West and Tampa, also increased in importance between
1890 and 1900, the products in the latter year being valued at
$10,735,826, or more than one-quarter more than in 1890, and in
1905 there was a further increase of 56.2%, the gross value being
$16,764,276, or nearly one-third of the total factory product of the
state. In 1900 Florida ranked fourth in the manufacture of tobacco
among the states of the Union, being surpassed by New York,
Pennsylvania and Ohio; in 1905 it ranked third (after New York
and Pennsylvania). Most of the tobacco used is imported from
Cuba, though, as has been indicated, the production of the state has
greatly increased since 1880. In the manufacture of fertilizers, the
raw material for which is derived from the phosphate beds, Florida&rsquo;s
aggregate product in 1900 was valued at $500,239, and in 1905 at
$1,590,371, an increase of 217.9% in five years.


Florida&rsquo;s industrial progress has been mainly since the Civil
War, for before that conflict a large part of the state was practically
undeveloped. An important influence has been the railways.
In 1880 the total railway mileage was 518 m.; in 1890 it was
2489 m.; in 1900, 3255 m., and in January 1909, 4,004.92 m. The
largest system is the Atlantic Coast Line, the lines of which in
Florida were built or consolidated by H.B. Plant (1819-1899) and
once formed a part of the so-called &ldquo;Plant System&rdquo; of railways.
The Florida East Coast Railway is also the product of one man&rsquo;s
faith in the country, that of Henry M. Flagler (b. 1830). The
Seaboard Air Line, the Louisville &amp; Nashville, and the Georgia
Southern &amp; Florida are the other important railways. The
Southern railway penetrates the state as far as Jacksonville,
over the tracks of the Atlantic Coast Line. A state railway
commission, whose members are elected by the people, has power
to enforce its schedule of freight rates except when such rates
would not pay the operating expenses of the railway. In 1882
the Florida East Coast Line Canal and Transportation Co. was
organized to develop a waterway from Jacksonville to Biscayne
Bay by connecting with canals the St Johns, Matanzas, and
Halifax rivers, Mosquito Lagoon, Indian river, Lake Worth,
Hillsboro river, New river, and Snake Creek; in 1908 this
vast undertaking was completed. The development of marine
commerce has been retarded by unimproved harbours, but
Fernandina and Pensacola harbours have always been good.
Since 1890 much has been done by the national Government,
aided in many cases by the local authorities and by private
enterprise, to improve the harbours and to extend the limits
of river navigation. With the increase of trade between the
United States and the West Indies following the Spanish-American
War (1898), the business of the principal ports, notably
of Fernandina, Tampa and Pensacola, greatly increased.

Population.&mdash;The population of Florida in 1880 was 269,493;
in 1890, 391,422, an increase of 45.2%; and in 1900, 528,542,
or a further increase of 35%; and in 1905, by a state census,
614,845; and in 1910, 752,619. In 1900, 95.5% were native born,
43.7% were coloured (including 479 Chinese, Japanese and
Indians), and in 1905 the percentages were little altered. The
Seminole Indians, whose number is not definitely known, live
in and near the Everglades. The urban population on the basis
of places having a population of 4000 or more was 16.6% of the
total in 1900 and 22.7% in 1905, the percentage for Florida,
as for other Southern States, being small as compared with the
percentage for most of the other states of the Union. In 1900
there were 92, and, in 1905, 125 incorporated cities, towns and
villages; but only 14 (in 1905, 22) of these had a population
of over 2000, and only 4 (in 1905, 8) a population of more than
5000. The four in 1900 were: Jacksonville (28,429); Pensacola
(17,747); Key West (17,114); and Tampa (15,839). The eight
in 1905 were Jacksonville (35,301), Tampa (22,823), Pensacola
(21,505), Key West (20,498), Live Oak (7200), Lake City
(6409), Gainesville (5413), and St Augustine (5121). Tallahassee
is the capital of the state. In 1906 the Baptists were the strongest
religious denomination; the Methodists ranked second, while
the Roman Catholic, Presbyterian and Protestant Episcopal
churches were of relatively minor importance.

Government.&mdash;The present constitution was framed in 1885
and was ratified by the people in 1886. Its most important
feature, when compared with the previous constitution of 1868,
is its provision for the choice of state officials other than the
governor (who was previously chosen by election) by elections
instead of by the governor&rsquo;s appointment, but the governor,
who serves for four years and is not eligible for the next succeeding
term, still appoints the circuit judges, the state attorneys
for each judicial circuit and the county commissioners; he may
fill certain vacancies and may suspend, and with the Senate
remove officers not liable to impeachment. The governor is a
member of the Board of Pardons, the other members being
the attorney-general, the secretary of state, the comptroller and
the commissioner of agriculture; he and the secretary of state,
attorney-general, comptroller, treasurer, superintendent of
public instruction, and commissioner of agriculture comprise a
Board of Commissioners of State Institutions; he is also a
member of the Board of Education. The office of lieutenant-governor
was abolished by the present constitution. The legislature
meets biennially, the senators being chosen for four, the
representatives for two years. By an amendment of 1896 the
Senate consists of not more than 32, and the House of Representatives
of not more than 68 members; by a two-thirds vote of
members present the legislature may pass a bill over the governor&rsquo;s
veto. The three judges of the Supreme Court and the seven of the
circuit court serve for six years, those of the county courts for
four years, and justices of the peace (one for each justice district,
of which the county commissioners must form at least two in
each county) hold office for four years. The constitutional
qualifications for suffrage are: the age of twenty-one years,
citizenship in the United States or presentation of naturalization
543
certificates at registration centres, residence in the state one
year and in the county six months, and registration. To these
requirements the payment of a poll-tax has been added by
legislative enactment, such an enactment having been authorized
by the constitution. Insane persons and persons under guardianship
are excluded by the constitution, and &ldquo;all persons convicted
of bribery, perjury, larceny or of infamous crime, or who shall
make or become directly or indirectly interested in any bet or
wager the result of which shall depend upon any election,&rdquo; or
who shall participate as principal, second or challenger in any
duel, are excluded by legislative enactment.

Amendments to the constitution may be made by a three-fifths
vote of each house of the legislature, ratified by a majority vote
of the people. A revision of the Constitution may be made
upon a two-thirds vote of all members of both Houses of the
legislature, if ratified by a majority vote of the people; a
Constitutional Convention is then to be provided for by the
legislature, such convention to meet within six months of the
passage of the law therefor, and to consist of a number equal to
the membership of the House of Representatives, apportioned
among the counties, as are the members of this House.

A homestead of 160 acres, or of one-half of an acre in an incorporated
town or city, owned by the head of a family residing
in the state, with personal property to the value of $1000 and
the improvements on the real estate, is exempt from enforced
sale except for delinquent taxes, purchase money, mortgage
or improvements on the property. The wife holds in her own
name property acquired before or after marriage; the intermarriage
of whites and negroes (or persons of negro descent to the
fourth generation) is prohibited. All these are constitutional
provisions. By legislative enactment whites and blacks living
in adultery are to be punished by imprisonment or fine; divorces
may be secured only after two years&rsquo; residence in the state and
on the ground of physical incapacity, adultery, extreme cruelty,
habitual indulgence in violent temper, habitual drunkenness,
desertion for one year, previous marriage still existing, or such
relationship of the parties as is within the degrees for which
marriage is prohibited by law. Legitimacy of natural children
can be established by subsequent marriage of the parents, and
the age of consent is sixteen years.


The bonded debt was incurred during the Reconstruction Period
(1865-1875). In 1871 7% 30 year bonds to the extent of $350,000
were issued and in 1873 another issue of 6% 30 year bonds to the
value of $925,000 was made. Most of these were held by the
Educational Fund at the time of their maturity. By 1901 all but
$267,700 of the issue of 1871 had been retired and this amount was
then refunded with 3% 50 year bonds which were taken by the
Educational Fund. In 1903 $616,800 of the 1873 issue was held
by the Educational Fund and $148,000 by individuals. The first
part of this claim was refunded by a new bond issue, also taken by
the Educational Fund, the second was paid from an Indian war
claim of $692,946, received from the United States government in
1902, when $132,000 bonds of 1857, held by the United States
government, were also extinguished. The bonded debt was thus
reduced to $884,500; and on the 1st of January 1909 the debt,
consisting of refunding bonds held as educational funds, amounted
to $601,567.


Penal System.&mdash;There is no penitentiary; the convicts are
hired to the one highest bidder who contracts for their labour,
and who undertakes, moreover, to lease all other persons
convicted during the term of the lease, and sub-leases the
prisoners. In 1889 the convicts were placed under the care
of a supervisor of convicts, and in 1905 the law was amended
so that one or more supervisors could be appointed at the will
of the governors. In 1908 there were four supervisors and one
state prison physician, and there are special laws designed to
prevent abuses in the system. In 1908 the state received
$208,148 from the lease of convicts. Decrepit prisoners were
formerly leased, but in 1906 the lease excluded such as were
thought unfit by the state prison physician. Women convicts
were still leased with the men in 1908; of the 446 convicts
committed in that year, there were 15 negro females, 356 negro
males and 75 white males. In the same year 54 escaped, and
27 were recaptured. The leased convicts are employed in the
turpentine and lumber industries and in the phosphate works.
The 1232 convicts &ldquo;on hand&rdquo; at the close of 1908 were held in
38 camps, 4 being the minimum, and 160 the maximum number,
at a camp. In 1908 two central hospitals for the prisoners were
maintained by the lessee company. County prison camps are
under the supervision of the governor and the supervisors of
convicts. The state supervisors must inspect each state prison
camp and each county prison camp every thirty days.

Education.&mdash;As early as 1831 an unsuccessful attempt was
made to form an adequate public school fund; the first real
effort to establish a common school system for the territory was
made after 1835; in 1840 there were altogether 18 academies
and 51 common schools, and in 1849 the state legislature made
an appropriation in the interest of the public instruction of white
pupils, and this was supplemented by the proceeds of land
granted by the United States government for the same purpose.
In 1852 Tallahassee established a public school; and in 1860
there were, according to a report of the United States census,
2032 pupils in the public schools of the state, and 4486 in
&ldquo;academies and other schools.&rdquo; The Civil War, however, interrupted
the early progress, and the present system of common
schools dates from the constitution of 1868 and the school law
of 1869. The school revenue derived from the interest of a
permanent school fund, special state and county taxes, and a
poll-tax, in 1907-1908 amounted to $1,716,161; the per capita
cost for each child of school age was $6.11 (white, $9.08;
negro, $2.24), and the average school term was 108 days (112
for whites, 99 for negroes). The state constitution prescribes
that &ldquo;white and colored children shall not be taught in the same
school, but impartial provision shall be made for both.&rdquo; The
percentage of enrolment in 1907-1908 was 60 (whites, 66;
negroes, 52). The percentage of attendance to enrolment was
70%,&mdash;68% for white and 74% for negro schools. Before
1905 the state provided for higher education by the Florida
State College, at Tallahassee, formerly the West Florida
Seminary (founded in 1857); the University of Florida, at Lake
City, which was organized in 1903 by enlarging the work of the
Florida Agricultural College (founded in 1884); the East Florida
Seminary, at Gainesville (founded 1848 at Ocala); the
normal school (for whites) at De Funiak Springs; and the South
Florida Military Institute at Bartow; but in 1905 the legislature
passed the Buckman bill abolishing all these state institutions
for higher education and establishing in their place the university
of the state of Florida and a state Agricultural Experiment
Station, both now at Gainesville, and the Florida Female College
at Tallahassee, which has the same standards for entrance and for
graduation as the state university for men. Private educational
institutions in Florida are John B. Stetson University at De Land
(Baptist); Rollins College (1885) at Winter Park (non-sectarian),
with a collegiate department, an academy, a school of music, a
school of expression, a school of fine arts, a school of domestic and
industrial arts, and a business school; Southern College (1901),
at Sutherland (Methodist Episcopal, South); the Presbyterian
College of Florida (1905), at Eustis; Jasper Normal Institute
(1890), at Jasper, and the Florida Normal Institute at Madison.
The negroes have facilities for advanced instruction in the
Florida Baptist Academy, and Cookman Institute (Methodist
Episcopal, South), both at Jacksonville, and in the Normal and
Manual Training School (Congregational), at Orange Park.
There are a school for the Blind, Deaf, and Dumb (1885) at St.
Augustine, a hospital for the insane at Chattahoochee and a
reform school at Marianna, all wholly supported by the state,
and a Confederate soldiers&rsquo; and sailors&rsquo; home at Tallahassee,
which is partially supported by the state.

History.&mdash;The earliest explorations and attempts at colonization
of Florida by Europeans were made by the Spanish. The
Council of the Indies claimed that since 1510 fleets and ships
had gone to Florida, and Florida is shown on the Cantino map
of 1502. In 1513 Juan Ponce de Leon (c. 1460-1521), who had
been with Christopher Columbus on his second voyage and had
later been governor of Porto Rico, obtained a royal grant
authorizing him to discover and settle &ldquo;Bimini,&rdquo;&mdash;a fabulous
island believed to contain a marvellous fountain or spring
544
whose waters would restore to old men their youth or at least
had wonderful curative powers. Soon after Easter Day he
came in sight of the coast of Florida, probably near the mouth
of the St Johns river. From the name of the day in the calendar,
Pascua Florida, or from the fact that many flowers were found
on the coast, the country was named Florida. De LeÃ³n seems
to have explored the coast, to some degree, on both sides of the
peninsula, and to have turned homeward fully convinced that
he had discovered an immense island. He returned to Spain
in 1514, and obtained from the king a grant to colonize &ldquo;the
island of Bimini and the island of Florida,&rdquo; of which he was
appointed adelantado, and in 1521 he made another expedition,
this one for colonization as well as for discovery. He seems
to have touched at the island of Tortugas, so named on account
of the large number of turtles found there, and to have landed
at several places, but many of his men succumbed to disease
and he himself was wounded in an Indian attack, dying soon
afterward in Cuba. Meanwhile, in 1516, another Spaniard,
Diego Miruelo, seems to have sailed for some distance along the
west coast of the peninsula. The next important exploration
of Florida was that of Panfilo de Narvaez. In 1527 he sailed
from Cuba with about 600 men (soon reduced to less than 400),
landed (early in 1528) probably at the present site of Pensacola,
and for six months remained in the country, he and his men
suffering terribly from exposure, hunger and fierce Indian
attacks. In September, his ships being lost and his force greatly
reduced in number, he hastily constructed a crazy fleet, re-embarked
probably at Apalachee Bay, and lost his life in a storm
probably near Pensacola Bay. Only four of his men, including
NuÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca, succeeded after eight years of Indian
captivity and of long and weary wanderings, in finding their
way to Spanish settlements in Mexico. Florida was also partially
explored by Ferdinando de Soto (q.v.) in 1539-1540. In the
summer of 1559 another attempt at colonization was made by
Tristan de Luna, who sailed from Vera Cruz, landed at Pensacola
Bay, and explored a part of Florida and (possibly) Southern
Alabama. Somewhere in that region he desired to make a
permanent settlement, but he was abandoned by most of his
followers and gave up his attempt in 1561.

In the following year, Jean Ribaut (1520-1565), with a band
of French Huguenots, landed first near St Augustine and then
at the mouth of the St Johns river, which he called the river
of May, and on behalf of France claimed the country, which
he described as &ldquo;the fairest, fruitfullest and pleasantest of all
the world&rdquo;; but he made his settlement on an island near what
is now Beaufort, South Carolina. In 1564 RenÃ© de LaudonniÃ¨re
(? -c. 1586), with another party of Huguenots, established
Fort Caroline at the mouth of the St Johns, but the colony did
not prosper, and in 1565 LaudonniÃ¨re was about to return to
France when (on the 28th of August) he was reinforced by
Ribaut and about 300 men from France. On the same day that
Ribaut landed, a Spanish expedition arrived in the bay of St
Augustine. It was commanded by Pedro MenÃ©ndez de AvilÃ©s
(1523-1574), one of whose aims was to destroy the Huguenot
settlement. This he did, putting to death almost the entire
garrison at Fort Caroline &ldquo;not as Frenchmen, but as Lutherans,&rdquo;
on the 20th of September 1565. The ships of Ribaut were soon
afterwards wrecked near Matanzas Inlet; he and most of his
followers surrendered to MenÃ©ndez and were executed. MenÃ©ndez
then turned his attention to the founding of a settlement which
he named St Augustine (q.v.); he also explored the Atlantic
coast from Cape Florida to St Helena, and established forts at
San Mateo (Fort Caroline), Avista, Guale and St Helena. In
1567 he returned to Spain in the interest of his colony.

The news of the destruction of Fort Caroline, and the execution
of Ribaut and his followers, was received with indifference at
the French court; but Dominique de Gourgues (c. 1530-1593),
a friend of Ribaut but probably a Catholic, organized an expedition
of vengeance, not informing his men of his destination
until his three ships were near the Florida coast. With the
co-operation of the Indians under their chief Saturiba he captured
Fort San Mateo in the spring of 1568, and on the spot where
the garrison of Fort Caroline had been executed, he hanged
his Spanish prisoners, inscribing on a tablet of pine the words,
&ldquo;I do this not as unto Spaniards but as to traitors, robbers
and murderers.&rdquo; Feeling unable to attack St Augustine, de
Gourgues returned to France.

The Spanish settlements experienced many vicissitudes.
The Indians were hostile and the missionary efforts among them
failed. In 1586 St Augustine was almost destroyed by Sir
Francis Drake and it also suffered severely by an attack of
Captain John Davis in 1665. Not until the last decade of the
17th century did the Spanish authorities attempt to extend the
settlements beyond the east coast. Then, jealous of the French
explorations along the Gulf of Mexico, they turned their attention
to the west coast, and in 1696 founded Pensacola. When
the English colonies of the Carolinas and Georgia were founded,
there was constant friction with Florida. The Spanish were
accused of inciting the Indians to make depredations on the
English settlements and of interfering with English commerce
and the Spanish were in constant fear of the encroachments of
the British. In 1702, when Great Britain and Spain were contending
in Europe, on opposite sides, in the war of the Spanish
Succession, a force from South Carolina captured St Augustine
and laid siege to the fort, but being unable to reduce it for lack
of necessary artillery, burned the town and withdrew at the
approach of Spanish reinforcements. In 1706 a Spanish and
French expedition against Charleston, South Carolina, failed,
and the Carolinians retaliated by invading middle Florida in
1708 and again in 1722. In 1740 General James Edward Oglethorpe,
governor of Georgia, supported by a naval force, made
an unsuccessful attack upon St Augustine; two years later a
Spanish expedition against Savannah by way of St Simon&rsquo;s
Island failed, and in 1745 Oglethorpe again appeared before
the walls of St Augustine, but the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle
in 1748 prevented further hostilities. Pensacola, the other
centre of Spanish settlement, though captured and occupied
(1719-1723) by the French from Louisiana, had a more peaceful
history.

By the treaty of Paris in 1763 Florida was ceded to England
in return for Havana. The provinces of East Florida and
West Florida were now formed, the boundaries of West Florida
being 31Â° N. lat. (when civil government was organized in 1767,
the N. line was made 32Â° 28&prime;), the Chattahoochee, and the
Apalachicola rivers, the Gulf of Mexico, Mississippi Sound,
Lakes Borgne, Pontchartrain and Maurepas, and the Mississippi
river. A period of prosperity now set in. Civil in place of
military government was instituted; immigration began;
and Andrew Turnbull, an Englishman, brought over a band of
about 1500 Minorcans (1769), whom he engaged in the cultivation
of indigo at New Smyrna. Roads were laid out, some of which
yet remain; and in the last three years of English occupation
the government spent $580,000 on the two provinces. Consequently,
the people of Florida were for the most part loyal to
Great Britain during the War of American Independence. In
1776, the Minorcans of New Smyrna refused to work longer on the
indigo plantations; and many of them removed to St Augustine,
where they were protected by the authorities. Several plans
were made to invade South Carolina and Georgia, but none
matured until 1778, when an expedition was organized which
co-operated with British forces from New York in the siege
of Savannah, Georgia. In the following year, Spain having
declared war against Great Britain, Don Bernardo de Galvez
(1756-1794), the Spanish governor at New Orleans, seized most
of the English forts in West Florida, and in 1781 captured
Pensacola.

By the treaty of Paris (1783) Florida reverted to Spain, and,
no religious liberty being promised, many of the English inhabitants
left East and West Florida. A dispute with the
United States concerning the northern boundary was settled by
the treaty of 1795, the line 31Â° N. lat. being established.

The westward expansion of the United States made necessary
American ports on the Gulf of Mexico; consequently the acquisition
of West Florida as well as of New Orleans was one of the
545
aims of the negotiations which resulted in the Louisiana Purchase
of 1803. After the cession of Louisiana to the United States,
the people of West Florida feared that that province would be
seized by Bonaparte. They, therefore, through a convention
at Buhler&rsquo;s Plains (July 17, 1810), formulated plans for a
more effective government. When it was found that the Spanish
governor did not accept these plans in good faith, another convention
was held on the 26th of September which declared
West Florida to be an independent state, organized a government
and petitioned for admission to the American Union. On the
27th of October President James Madison, acting on a theory of
Robert R. Livingston that West Florida was ceded by Spain to
France in 1800 along with Louisiana, and was therefore included
by France in the sale of Louisiana to the United States in 1803,
declared West Florida to be under the jurisdiction of the United
States. Two years later the American Congress annexed the
portion of West Florida between the Pearl and the Mississippi
rivers to Louisiana (hence the so-called Florida parishes of
Louisiana), and that between the Pearl and the Perdido to the
Mississippi Territory.

In the meantime war between Great Britain and the United
States was imminent. The American government asked the
Spanish authorities of East Florida to permit an American
occupation of the country in order that it might not be seized
by Great Britain and made a base of military operations. When
the request was refused, American forces seized Fernandina in
the spring of 1812, an action that was repudiated by the American
government after protest from Spain, although it was authorized
in official instructions. About the same time an attempt to
organize a government at St Mary&rsquo;s was made by American
sympathizers, and a petty civil war began between the Americans,
who called themselves &ldquo;Patriots,&rdquo; and the Indians, who were
encouraged by the Spanish. In 1814 British troops landed
at Pensacola to begin operations against the United States.
In retaliation General Andrew Jackson captured the place, but
in a few days withdrew to New Orleans. The British then
built a fort on the Apalachicola river, and there directed expeditions
of Indians and runaway negroes against the American
settlements, which continued long after peace was concluded
in 1814. In 1818 General Jackson, believing that the Spanish
were aiding the Seminole Indians and inciting them to attack
the Americans, again captured Pensacola. By the treaty of
1819 Spain formally ceded East and West Florida to the United
States; the treaty was ratified in 1821, when the United States
took formal possession, but civil government was not established
until 1822.

Indian affairs furnished the most serious problems of the
new Territory of Florida. The aborigines, who seemed to have
reached a stage of civilization somewhat similar to that of
the Aztecs, were conquered and exterminated or absorbed by
Creeks about the middle of the 18th century. There was a
strong demand for the removal of these Creek Indians, known
as Seminoles, and by treaties at Payne&rsquo;s Landing in 1832 and
Fort Gibson in 1833 the Indian chiefs agreed to exchange their
Florida lands for equal territory in the western part of the United
States. But a strong sentiment against removal suddenly
developed, and the efforts of the United States to enforce the
treaty brought on the Seminole War (1836-42), which resulted
in the removal of all but a few hundred Seminoles whose
descendants still live in southern Florida.

In 1845 Florida became a state of the American Union. On
the 10th of January 1861 an ordinance of secession, which
declared Florida to be a &ldquo;sovereign and independent nation,&rdquo;
was adopted by a state convention, and Florida became one of
the Confederate States of America. The important coast towns
were readily captured by Union forces; Fernandina, Pensacola
and St Augustine in 1862, and Jacksonville in 1863; but an
invasion of the interior in 1864 failed, the Union forces being
repulsed in a battle at Olustee (on the 20th of February 1864).
In 1865 a provisional governor was appointed by President
Andrew Johnson, and a new state government was organized.
The legislature of 1866 rejected the Fourteenth Amendment
to the Federal Constitution, and soon afterwards Florida was
made a part of the Third Military District, according to the
Reconstruction Act of 1867. Negroes were now registered as
voters by the military authorities, and another Constitutional
Convention met in January and February 1868. A factional
strife in the dominant party, the Republican, now began; fifteen
delegates withdrew from the convention; the others framed a
constitution, and then resolved themselves into a political
convention. The seceding members with nine others then
returned and organized; but the factions were reconciled by
General George M. Meade. A new constitution was framed and
was ratified by the electors, and Florida passed from under a
quasi-military to a full civil government on the 4th of July 1868.

The factional strife in the Republican party continued, a
number of efforts being made to impeach Governor Harrison
Reed (1813-1899). The decisive year of the Reconstruction
Period was 1876. The Canvassing Board, which published the
election returns, cast out some votes, did not wait for the returns
from Dade county, and declared the Republican ticket elected.
George F. Drew (1827-1900), the Democratic candidate for
governor, then secured a mandamus from the circuit court
restraining the board from going behind the face of the election
returns; this was not obeyed and a similar mandamus was
therefore obtained from the supreme court of Florida, which
declared that the board had no right to determine the legality
of a particular vote. According to the new count thus ordered,
the Democratic state ticket was elected. By a similar process
the board&rsquo;s decision in favour of the election of Republican
presidential electors was nullified, and the Democratic electors
were declared the successful candidates; but the electoral
commission, appointed by Congress, reversed this decision. (See
Electoral Commission.)

Since 1876 Florida has been uniformly Democratic in politics.

FLORIDABLANCA, DON JOSE MOÃ‘INO Y REDONDO,
Count of (1728-1808), Spanish statesman, was born at Murcia
in 1728. He was the son of a retired army officer, and received
a good education, which he completed at the university of
Salamanca, especially applying himself to the study of law.
For a time he followed the profession of an advocate, and acquired
a high reputation. A more public career was opened to him
by the marquis of Esquilache, then chief minister of state, who
sent him ambassador to Pope Clement XIV. Successful in his
mission, he was soon after appointed by Charles III. successor
to his patron, and his administration was one of the most brilliant
Spain had ever seen. He regulated the police of Madrid, reformed
many abuses, projected canals, established many societies of
agriculture and economy and many philanthropical institutions,
and gave encouragement to learning, science and the fine arts.
Commerce flourished anew under his rule, and the long-standing
disputes with Portugal about the South American colonies were
settled. He sought to strengthen the alliance of Spain with
Portugal by a double marriage between the members of the
royal houses, designing by this arrangement to place ultimately
a Spanish prince on the throne of Portugal. But in this he failed.
Floridablanca was the right-hand man of King Charles III. in
his policy of domestic reform, and was much under the influence
of French philosophes and economic writers. Like other reformers
of that school he was a strong supporter of the royal
authority and a convinced partisan of benevolent despotism.
The French Revolution frightened him into reaction, and he
advocated the support of the first coalition against France.
He retained his office for three years under Charles IV.; but in
1792, through the influence of the favourite Godoy, he was
dismissed and imprisoned in the castle of Pampeluna. Here
he was saved from starvation only by the intervention of his
brother. He was afterwards allowed to retire to his estates,
and remained in seclusion till the French invasion of 1808. He
was then called by his countrymen to take the presidency of
the central junta. But his strength failed him, and he died at
Seville on the 20th of November of the same year. He left
several short treatises on jurisprudence.

FLORIDOR [Josias de Soulas, Sieur de Prinefosse] (d. c.
1671), French actor, was born in Brie early in the 17th century,
the son of a gentleman of German family who had moved to
France, married there, and become a Roman Catholic. The son
entered the French army, but after being promoted ensign,
quitted the army for the theatre, where he took the name
of Floridor. His first Paris appearance was in 1640. Three
years later he was called to the company at the HÃ´tel de Bourgogne,
where he played all the leading parts in tragedy and
comedy and became the head of his profession. He was a man
of superb physique and excellent carriage, with a flexible and
sonorous voice, and manners of rare distinction and elegance.
He was much liked at court, and Louis XIV. held him in particular
esteem. He died in 1671 or 1672.



FLORIN, the name applied to several coins of the continent
of Europe and to two coins struck in England at different times.
The word comes through the Fr. florin from the Ital. fiorino,
flower, Lat. flos, florem. Fiorino was the Italian name of a gold
coin issued at Florence in 1252, weighing about fifty-four grains.
This coin bore on the obverse a lily, from which it took its name
of &ldquo;the flower,&rdquo; on the reverse the Latin name of the city
Florentia, from which it was also known as a &ldquo;florence.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Florin&rdquo; and &ldquo;florence&rdquo; seem to have been used in English
indiscriminately as the name of this coin. The Florentine florin
was held in great commercial repute throughout Europe, and
similar coins were struck in Germany, other parts of Italy,
France, &amp;c. The English gold florin was introduced by Edward
III. in 1343, half and quarter florins being struck at the same
time. This gold florin weighed 108 grains and was to be current
for six shillings. It was found, however, to be overvalued in
proportion to the silver currency and was demonetized the
following year. The florin did not again appear in the English
coinage until 1849, when silver coins with this name, having
a nominal value of two shillings (one-tenth of a pound), were
struck. When first issued the &ldquo;Dei gratia&rdquo; was omitted from
the inscription, and they were frequently referred to as the
&ldquo;Godless&rdquo; or &ldquo;graceless&rdquo; florins. The D.G. was added in
1852. In 1887 a double florin or four shilling piece was issued,
but its coinage was discontinued in 1890. The total value of
double florins issued during these years amounted to Â£533,125.

FLORIO, GIOVANNI (1553?-1625), English writer, was born
in London about 1553. He was of Tuscan origin, his parents
being Waldenses who had fled from persecution in the Valtelline
and taken refuge in England. His father, Michael Angelo
Florio, was pastor of an Italian Protestant congregation in
London in 1550. He was attached to the household of Sir
William Cecil, but dismissed on a charge of immorality. He
dedicated a book on the Italian language to Henry Herbert,
and may have been a tutor in the family of William Herbert,
earl of Pembroke. Anthony Ã  Wood says that the Florios left
England on the accession of Queen Mary, but returned after her
death. The son resided for a time at Oxford, and was appointed,
about 1576 tutor to the son of Richard Barnes, bishop of Durham,
then studying at Magdalen College. In 1578 Florio published
a work entitled First Fruits, which yield Familiar Speech, Merry
Proverbs, Witty Sentences, and Golden Sayings (4to). This was
accompanied by A Perfect Induction to the Italian and English
Tongues. The work was dedicated to the earl of Leicester.
Three years later Florio was admitted a member of Magdalen
College, and became a teacher of French and Italian in the university.
In 1591 appeared his Second Fruits, to be gathered of
Twelve Trees, of divers but delightsome Tastes to the Tongues of
Italian and English men; to which was annexed the Garden of
Recreation, yielding six thousand Italian Proverbs (4to). These
manuals contained an outline of the grammar, a selection of
dialogues in parallel columns of Italian and English, and longer
extracts from classical Italian writers in prose and verse. Florio
had many patrons; he says that he &ldquo;lived some years&rdquo; with
the earl of Southampton, and the earl of Pembroke also befriended
him. His Italian and English dictionary, entitled
A World of Words, was published in folio in 1598. After the
accession of James I., Florio was named French and Italian
tutor to Prince Henry, and afterwards became a gentleman of the
privy chamber and clerk of the closet to the queen, whom he
also instructed in languages. His magnum opus is the admirable
translation of the Essayes on Morall, Politike, and Millitarie
Discourses of Lo. Michaell de Montaigne, published in folio in
1603 in three books, each dedicated to two noble ladies. A
second edition in 1613 was dedicated to the queen. Special
interest attaches to the first edition from the circumstance that
of the several copies in the British Museum library one bears
the autograph of Shakespeare&mdash;long received as genuine but
now supposed to be by an 18th-century hand&mdash;and another that
of Ben Jonson. It was suggested by Warburton that Florio is
satirized by Shakespeare under the character of Holofernes, the
547
pompous pedant of Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost, but it is much more likely,
especially as he was one of the earl of Southampton&rsquo;s protÃ©gÃ©s,
that he was among the personal friends of the dramatist, who
may well have gained his knowledge of Italian and French from
him. He had married the sister of the poet Daniel, and had
friendly relations with many writers of his day. Ben Jonson
sent him a copy of Volpone with the inscription, &ldquo;To his loving
father and worthy friend Master John Florio, Ben Jonson
seals this testimony of his friendship and love.&rdquo; He is characterized
by Wood, in Athenae Oxonienses, as a very useful man in
his profession, zealous for his religion, and deeply attached to
his adopted country. He died at Fulham, London, in the
autumn of 1625.



FLORIS, FRANS, or more correctly Frans de Vriendt,
called Floris (1520-1570), Flemish painter, was one of a large
family trained to the study of art in Flanders. Son of a stonecutter,
Cornelis de Vriendt, who died at Antwerp in 1538, he
began life as a student of sculpture, but afterwards gave up
carving for painting. At the age of twenty he went to LiÃ©ge
and took lessons from Lambert Lombard, a pupil of Mabuse,
whose travels in Italy had transformed a style truly Flemish
into that of a mongrel Leonardesque. Following in the footsteps
of Mabuse, Lambert Lombard had visited Florence, and caught
the manner of Salviati and other pupils of Michelangelo and
Del Sarto. It was about the time when Schoreel, Coxcie and
Heemskerk, after migrating to Rome and imitating the masterpieces
of Raphael and Buonarroti, came home to execute Dutch-Italian
works beneath the level of those produced in the peninsula
itself by Leonardo da Pistoia, Nanaccio and Rinaldo of Mantua.
Fired by these examples, Floris in his turn wandered across
the Alps, and appropriated without assimilation the various
mannerisms of the schools of Lombardy, Florence and Rome.
Bold, quick and resolute, he saw how easy it would be to earn a
livelihood and acquire a name by drawing for engravers and
painting on a large scale after the fashion of Vasari. He came
home, joined the gild of Antwerp in 1540, and quickly opened a
school from which 120 disciples are stated to have issued. Floris
painted strings of large pictures for the country houses of Spanish
nobles and the villas of Antwerp patricians. He is known to
have illustrated the fable of Hercules in ten compositions, and
the liberal arts in seven, for Claes Jongeling, a merchant of
Antwerp, and adorned the duke of Arschot&rsquo;s palace of Beaumont
with fourteen colossal panels. Comparatively few of his works
have descended to us, partly because they came to be contemned
for their inherent defects, and so were suffered to perish, partly
because they were soon judged by a different standard from
that of the Flemings of the 16th century. The earliest extant
canvas by Floris is the &ldquo;Mars and Venus ensnared by Vulcan&rdquo; in
the Berlin Museum (1547), the latest a &ldquo;Last Judgment&rdquo; (1566)
in the Brussels gallery. Neither these nor any of the intermediate
works at Alost, Antwerp, Copenhagen, Dresden, Florence,
LÃ©au, Madrid, St Petersburg and Vienna display any charm
of originality in composition or in form. Whatever boldness
and force they may possess, or whatever principles they may
embody, they are mere appropriations of Italian models spoiled
in translation or adaptation. Their technical execution reveals
a rapid hand, but none of the lustre of bright colouring; and
Floris owed much of his repute to the cleverness with which
his works were transferred to copper by Jerome Cock and
Theodore de Galle. Whilst Floris was engaged on a Crucifixion
of 27 ft., and a Resurrection of equal size, for the grand prior
of Spain, he was seized with illness, and died on the 1st of October
1570 at Antwerp.



FLORUS, Roman historian, flourished in the time of Trajan
and Hadrian. He compiled, chiefly from Livy, a brief sketch
of the history of Rome from the foundation of the city to the
closing of the temple of Janus by Augustus (25 B.C.). The work,
which is called Epitome de T. Livio Bellorum omnium annorum
DCC Libri duo, is written in a bombastic and rhetorical style,
and is rather a panegyric of the greatness of Rome, whose life
is divided into the four periods of infancy, youth, manhood
and old age. It is often wrong in geographical and chronological
details; but, in spite of its faults, the book was much used in the
middle ages. In the MSS. the writer is variously given as Julius
Florus, Lucius Anneus Florus, or simply Annaeus Florus. From
certain similarities of style he has been identified with Publius
Annius Florus, poet, rhetorician and friend of Hadrian, author
of a dialogue on the question whether Virgil was an orator or
poet, of which the introduction has been preserved.


The best editions are by O. Jahn (1852), C. Halm (1854), which
contain the fragments of the Virgilian dialogue. There is an English
translation in Bohn&rsquo;s Classical Library.




FLORUS, JULIUS, poet, orator, and jurist of the Augustan
age. His name has been immortalized by Horace, who dedicated
to him two of his Epistles (i. 3; ii. 2), from which it would
appear that he composed lyrics of a light, agreeable kind. The
statement of Porphyrion, the old commentator on Horace, that
Florus himself wrote satires, is probably erroneous, but he may
have edited selections from the earlier satirists (Ennius, Lucilius,
Varro). Nothing is definitely known of his personality, except
that he was one of the young men who accompanied Tiberius on
his mission to settle the affairs of Armenia. He has been variously
identified with Julius Florus, a distinguished orator and uncle
of Julius Secundus, an intimate friend of Quintilian (Instit. x.
3, 13); with the leader of an insurrection of the Treviri (Tacitus,
Ann. iii. 40); with the Postumus of Horace (Odes, ii. 14)
and even with the historian Florus.



FLORUS, PUBLIUS ANNIUS, Roman poet and rhetorician,
identified by some authorities with the historian Florus (q.v.).
The introduction to a dialogue called Virgilius orator an poÃ«ta
is extant, in which the author (whose name is given as Publius
Annius Florus) states that he was born in Africa, and at an
early age took part in the literary contests on the Capitol instituted
by Domitian. Having been refused a prize owing to the
prejudice against African provincials, he left Rome in disgust,
and after travelling for some time set up at Tarraco as a teacher
of rhetoric. Here he was persuaded by an acquaintance to
return to Rome, for it is generally agreed that he is the Florus
who wrote the well-known lines quoted together with Hadrian&rsquo;s
answer by Aelius Spartianus (Hadrian 16). Twenty-six trochaic
tetrameters, De qualitate vitae, and five graceful hexameters,
De rosis, are also attributed to him. Florus is important as
being the first in order of a number of 2nd-century African
writers who exercised a considerable influence on Latin literature,
and also the first of the poÃ«tae neoterici or novelli (new-fashioned
poets) of Hadrian&rsquo;s reign, whose special characteristic was the
use of lighter and graceful metres (anapaestic and iambic
dimeters), which had hitherto found little favour.


The little poems will be found in E. BÃ¤hrens, PoÃ«tae Latini minores
(1879-1883); for an unlikely identification of Florus with the author
of the Pervigilium Veneris (q.v.) see E.H.O. MÃ¼ller, De P. Annio
Floro poÃ«ta et de Pervigilio Veneris (1855), and, for the poet&rsquo;s relations
with Hadrian, F. Eyssenhardt, Hadrian und Florus (1882);
see also F. Marx in Pauly-Wissowa&rsquo;s RealencyclopÃ¤die, i. pt. 2 (1894).




FLOTOW, FRIEDRICH FERDINAND ADOLF VON, Freiherr
(1812-1883), German composer, was born on his father&rsquo;s estate
at Teutendorf, in Mecklenburg, on the 27th of April 1812.
Destined originally for the diplomatic profession, his passion
for music induced his father to send him to Paris to study
under Reicha. But the outbreak of the revolution in 1830
caused his return home, where he busied himself writing chamber-music
and operetta until he was able to return to Paris. There
he produced Pierre et CathÃ©rine, Rob Roy, La Duchesse de Guise,
but made his first real success with Le Naufrage de la MÃ©duse
at the Renaissance ThÃ©Ã¢tre in 1838. Greater, however, was the
success which attended Stradella (1844) and Martha (1847),
which made the tour of the world. In 1848 Flotow was again
driven home by the Revolution, and in the course of a few years
he produced Die GrossfÃ¼rstin (1850), Indra (1853), RÃ¼bezahl
(1854), Hilda (1855) and Albin (1856). From 1856 to 1863
he was director (Intendant) of the Schwerin opera, but in the
latter year he returned to Paris, where in 1869 he produced
L&rsquo;Ombre. From that time to the date of his death he lived in
Paris or on his estate near Vienna. He died on the 24th of
548
January 1883. Of his concert-music only the JubelouvertÃ¼re
is now ever heard. His strength lay in the facility of his
melodies.



FLOTSAM, JETSAM and LIGAN, in English law, goods lost
at sea, as distinguished from goods which come to land, which
are technically designated wreck. Jetsam (the same word as
jettison, from Lat. jactare, to throw) is when goods are cast into
the sea, and there sink and remain under water; flotsam (floatson,
from float, Lat. flottare) is where they continue floating on the
surface of the waves; ligan (or lagan, from lay or lie) is where
they are sunk in the sea, but tied to a cork or buoy in order to
be found again. Flotsam, jetsam and ligan belong to the
sovereign in the absence only of the true owner. Wreck, on the
other hand (i.e. goods cast on shore), was by the common law
adjudged to the sovereign in any case, because it was said by
the loss of the ship all property was gone out of the original
owner. This singular distinction which treated goods washed
ashore as lost, and goods on and in the sea as not lost, is no doubt
to be explained by the primitive practice of plundering wrecked
ships. (See Wreck.)



FLOUNDER, a common term for flat-fish. The name is also
more specially given to certain varieties, according to local
usage. Thus the Pleuronectes flesus is the common flounder
of English terminology, found along the coasts of northern
Europe from the Bristol Channel to Iceland. It is particularly
partial to fresh water, ascending the Rhine as far as Cologne.
It rarely exceeds a length of 12 in. or a weight of 1Â½ &#8468; In
American terminology the principal fish of the name are the
&ldquo;summer flounders&rdquo; or &ldquo;deep-sea flounders,&rdquo; also known
in America as &ldquo;plaice&rdquo; (Paralichthys dentatus), as long as 3 ft.
and as heavy as 15 &#8468;; the &ldquo;four-spotted flounders&rdquo; (Paralichthys
oblongus); the &ldquo;common&rdquo; or &ldquo;winter&rdquo; flounder
(Pseudopleuronectes americanus); the &ldquo;diamond flounder&rdquo;
(Hysopsetta guttulata); and the &ldquo;pole flounder&rdquo; (Glyptocephalus
cynoglossus).



FLOUR and FLOUR MANUFACTURE. The term &ldquo;flour&rdquo;
(Fr. fleur, flower, i.e. the best part) is usually applied to the
triturated farinaceous constituents of the wheat berry (see
Wheat); it is, however, also used of other cereals and even of
leguminoids when ground into a fine powder, and of many other
substances in a pulverulent state, though in these cases it is
usual to speak of rye flour, bean flour, &amp;c. The flour obtained
from oats is generally termed oatmeal. In Great Britain wheaten
flour was commonly known in the 16th and 17th centuries as
meal, and up to the beginning of the 19th century, or perhaps
later, the term mealing trade was not infrequently used of the
milling trade.

The ancestor of the millstone was apparently a rounded stone
about the size of a man&rsquo;s fist, with which grain or nuts were
pounded and crushed into a rude meal. These stones
are generally of hard sandstone and were evidently

used against another stone, which by dint of continual
hammering was broken into hollows. Sometimes the crusher
was used on the surface of rocks. St Bridget&rsquo;s stone, on the
shore of Lough Macnean, is supposed to have been a primitive
Irish mill; there are many depressions in the face of the table-like
rock, and it is probable that round this stone several women
(for in early civilization the preparation of flour was peculiarly
the duty of the women) would stand and grind, or rather pound,
meal. Many such stones, known as Bullan stones, still exist in
Ireland. Similar remains are found in the Orkneys and Shetlands,
and it is on record that some of these stones have been used
for flour-making within historic times. Richard Bennett in his
History of Corn Milling remarks that the Seneca Indians to this
day boil maize and crush it into a paste between loose stones.
In the same way the Omahas pound this cereal in holes in the
rocks, while the Oregon Indians parch and pound the capsules
of the yellow lily, much after the fashion described by Herodotus
in his account of the ancient Egyptians. In California the
Indian squaws make a sort of paste by crushing acorns between
a round stone or &ldquo;muller,&rdquo; and a cuplike hollow in the surface
of a rock. Crushing stones are of different shapes, ranging
from the primitive ball-like implement to an elongated shape
resembling the pestle of a mortar. Mullers of the latter type
are not infrequent among prehistoric remains in America, while
Dr Schliemann discovered several specimens of the globular
form on the reputed site of the city of Troy, and also among the
ruins of Mycenae. As a matter of fact stone mullers survived
in highly civilized countries into modern days, if indeed they are
now altogether extinct.

The saddle-stone is the connecting link between the primitive
pounder, or muller, and the quern, which was itself the direct
ancestor of the millstones still used to some extent
in the manufacture of flour. The saddle-stone, the
Saddle-stone.
first true grinding implement, consisted of a stone with
a more or less concave face on which the grain was spread, and
in and along this hollow surface it was rubbed and ground into
coarse meal. Saddle-stones have been discovered in the sand
caves of Italy, among the lake dwellings of Switzerland, in the
dolmens of France, in the pit dwellings of the British Isles, and
among the remains of primitive folk all the world over. The
Romans of the classical period seem to have distinguished the
saddle-stone from the quern. We find allusions to the mola
trusatilis, which may be translated &ldquo;the thrusting mill&rdquo;; this
would fairly describe a backwards and forwards motion. The
mola versatilis evidently referred to the revolving millstone or
quern. In primitive parts of the world the saddle-stone is not
yet extinct, as for instance in Mexico. It is known as the metata,
and is used both for grinding maize and for making the maize
cakes known as tortillas. The same implement is apparently
still in use in some parts of South America, notably in Chile.

According to Richard Bennett, the quern, the first complete
milling machine, originated in Italy and is in all probability
not older than the 2nd century B.C. This is, however,
a controverted point. Querns are still used in most
Quern.
primitive countries, nor is it certain that they have altogether
disappeared from remoter districts of Scotland and Ireland.
Whatever was their origin, they revolutionized flour milling.
The rotary motion of millstones became the essential principle
of the trituration of grain, and exists to-day in the rolls of the
roller mill. The early quern appears to have differed from its
descendants in that it was somewhat globular in shape, the
lower stone being made conical, possibly with the idea that the
ground flour should be provided with a downward flow to enable
it to fall from the stones. This type did not, however, persist.
Gradually the convexity disappeared and the surface of the
two stones became flat or very nearly so. In the upper stone
was a species of funnel, through which the grain passed as through
a hopper, making its way thence, as the stone revolved, into the
space between the running and the bed stone. The ground
meal was discharged at the periphery. The runner, or upper
stone, was provided with a wooden handle by which the stone
was revolved. The typical Roman mill of the Augustan age
may be seen at Pompeii. Here, in what is believed to have
been a public pistrinum or mill, were found four pairs of millstones.
The circular base of these mills is 5 ft. in diameter and
1 ft. high, and upon it was fastened the meta, a blunt cone about
2 ft. high, on which fitted the upper millstone or catillus, also
conical. These mills were evidently rotated by slave labour,
as there was no room for the perambulation of a horse or donkey,
while the side-lugs in which the handle-bars were inserted are
plainly visible. Slave labour was generally used up to the
introduction of Christianity, but was finally abolished by the
emperor Constantine, though even after his edict mills continued
to be driven by criminals.

The Romans are credited by some authorities with having
first applied power to the driving of millstones, which they
connected with water-wheels by a horizontal spindle
through the intervention of bevel gearing. But long
Use of power.
after millstones had been harnessed to water power
slave labour was largely employed as a motive force. The watermill
of the Romans was introduced at a relatively early period
into Britain. Domesday Book shows that England was covered
by mills of a kind at the time of the Norman conquest, and
549
mentions some 500 mills in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk
alone. No doubt the mola of Domesday Book consisted of one
pair of stones connected by rude gearing with a water-wheel.
Windmills are said to have been introduced by the Crusaders,
who brought them from the East. Steam power is believed
to have been first used in a British flour mill towards the close
of the 18th century, when Boulton &amp; Watt installed a steam
engine in the Albion Flour Mills in London, erected under the
care of John Rennie. Another great engineer, Sir William
Fairbairn, in the early days of the 19th century, left the impress
of his genius on the mill and all its accessories. He was followed
by other clever engineers, and in the days immediately preceding
the roller period many improvements were introduced as regards
the balancing and driving of millstones. The introduction of
the blast and exhaust to keep the stones cool was a great step
in advance, while the substitution of silk gauze for woollen or
linen bolting cloth, about the middle of the 19th century, marked
another era in British milling. Millstones, as used just before
the introduction of roller milling, were from 4 to 4Â½ ft. in diameter
by some 12 in. in thickness, and were usually made of a siliceous
stone, known as buhr-stone, much of which came from the quarry
of La FertÃ©-sous-Jouarre, in France.

Nine-tenths, or perhaps ninety-nine hundredths, of all the
flour consumed in Great Britain is made in roller mills, that is,
mills in which the wheat is broken and floured by
means of rollers, some grooved in varying degrees

of fineness, some smooth, their work being preceded
and supplemented by a wide range of other machinery. All
roller mills worthy of the name are completely automatic, that
is to say, from the time the raw material enters the mill warehouse
till it is sacked, either in the shape of finished flour or of offals,
it is touched by no human hand.

The history of roller milling extends back to the first half
of the 19th century. Roller mills, that is to say, machines
fitted with rolls set either horizontally, or vertically, or obliquely,
for the grinding of corn, are said to have been used as far back
as the 17th century, but if this be so it is certain that they were
only used in a tentative manner. Towards the middle of the
19th century the firm of E.R. &amp; F. Turner, of Ipswich, began to
build roller mills for breaking wheat as a preliminary to the
conversion of the resultant middlings on millstones. The rolls
were made of chilled iron and were provided with serrated edges,
which must have exercised a tearing action on the integuments
of the berry. These mills were built to the design of a German
engineer, of the name of G.A. Buchholz, and were exhibited at
the London exhibition of 1862, but they never came into general
use. It has also been stated that as early as 1823 a French
engineer, named Collier, of Paris, patented a roller mill, while
five years later a certain Malar took out another French patent,
the specification of which speaks of grooves and differential
speeds. But the direct ancestors of the roller mills of the present
day were brought out some time in the third decade of the 19th
century by a Swiss engineer named Sulzberger. His apparatus
was rather cumbrous, and the chilled iron rolls with which it
was fitted consumed a large amount of power relatively to the
work effected. But the Pester Walz-MÃ¼hle, founded in 1839
by Count Szechenyi, a Hungarian nobleman, which took its
name from the roller mills with which it was equipped by Sulzberger,
was for many years a great success; some of its roller
mills are said to have been kept at work for upwards of forty
years, and one at least is preserved in the museum at Budapest.

It may be noted that Hungarian wheat is hard and flinty and
well adapted for treatment by rolls. Moreover, gradual reduction,
as now understood, was more or less practised in
Hungary, even before the introduction of roller
Hungarian practice.
milling. Though millstones, and not rolls, were used,
yet the wheat was not floured at one operation, as in typical
low or flat grinding, but was reduced to flour in several successive
operations. In the first break the stones would be placed just
wide enough apart to &ldquo;end&rdquo; the wheat, and in each succeeding
operation the stones were brought closer together. But Hungarian
milling was not then automatic in the sense in which
British millers understand the word. For a long time a great
deal of hand labour was employed in the merchant mills of
Budapest in carrying about products from one machine to
another for further treatment. This practice may have been
partly due to the cheap labour available, but it was also the
deliberate policy of Hungarian millers to handle in this way the
middlings and fine &ldquo;dunst,&rdquo; because it was maintained that
only thus could certain products be delivered to the machine
by which they were to be treated in the perfection of condition.
The results were good so far as the finished products were concerned,
but in the light of modern automatic milling the system
appears uneconomical. Not only did it postulate an inordinately
large staff, but it further increased the labour bill by the demand
it made on the number of sub-foremen who were occupied in
classifying, largely by touch, the various products, and directing
the labourers under them. Hungarian milling still differs
widely from milling as practised in Great Britain in being a longer
system. This is due to the more minute subdivision of products,
a necessary consequence of the large number of grades of flour
and offals made in Hungary, where there are many intermediate
varieties of middlings and &ldquo;dunst&rdquo; for which no corresponding
terms are available in an English miller&rsquo;s vocabulary.

It will be convenient here to explain the meaning of three
terms constantly used by millers, namely, semolina, middlings
and dunst. These three products of roller mills are
practically identical in composition, but represent
Semolina, middlings, dunst.
different stages in the process of reducing the endosperm
of the wheat to flour. A wheat berry is covered
by several layers of skin, while under these layers is the floury
kernel or endosperm. This the break or grooved rolls tend to
tear and break up. The largest of these more or less cubical
particles are known as semolina, whilst the medium-sized are
called middlings and the smallest sized termed dunst. The last
is a German word, with several meanings, but is used in this
particular sense by German and Austrian millers, from whom
it was doubtless borrowed by the pioneers of roller milling in
England. If we were to lay a sample of fairly granular flour
beside a sample of small dunst the two would be easy to distinguish,
but place a magnifying glass over the flour and it
would look very like the dunst. If we were to repeat this experiment
on dunst and fine middlings, the former would under the
glass present a strong resemblance to the middlings. The same
effect would be produced by the putting side by side of large
middlings and small semolina. This is a broad description of
semolina, middlings and dunst. Semolina and middlings are
more apt to vary in appearance than dunst, because the latter
is the product of the later stages of the milling process and
represents small particles of the floury kernel tolerably free
from such impurities as bran or fluff. The flour producing
middlings must not be confounded with the variety of wheat
offal which is also known to many English millers as middlings.
This consists of husk or bran, more or less comminuted, and with
a certain proportion of floury particles adherent. It is only
fit for feeding beasts.

The spread of roller milling on the continent of Europe was
undoubtedly accelerated by the invention of porcelain rolls,
by Friedrich Wegmann, a Swiss miller, which were
brought into general use in the seventh decade of the
Porcelain rolls.
19th century, and are still widely employed. They are
admirably fitted for the reduction of semolina, middlings and
dunst into flour; and for reducing pure middlings, that is,
middlings containing no bran or wheat husk, there is perhaps
nothing that quite equals them. They were introduced into
Great Britain in 1877, or thereabouts, and were used for several
years, but ultimately they almost disappeared from British
mills. This was partly due to the fact that as made at that date
they were rather difficult to work, as it was not easy to keep
the rolls perfectly parallel. Another drawback was their inadaptability
to over-heavy feeds, to which the British, and
perhaps still more the American, miller is frequently obliged
to resort. However, since the beginning of the 20th century
some of the most advanced flour mills in England have again

taken to using porcelain rolls for some part of their reduction
process.

The birth of roller milling in Great Britain may be said to
date from 1872, when Oscar Oexle, a German milling engineer,
erected a set of roller mills in the Tradeston Mills,
in Glasgow. This was long before the introduction of
Roller milling in England.
automatic roller mills. But the foundations of the
millstone system were not seriously disturbed till
1877, when a party of leading British and Irish millers visited
Vienna and Budapest with the object of studying roller milling
in its native home. In 1878 J.H. Carter installed in the mill
of J. Boland, of Dublin, what was probably the first complete
automatic roller plant erected in the United Kingdom, and in
1881 a milling exhibition held at the Royal Agricultural Hall,
London, showed the automatic roller system in complete operation.
From that time the roller system made great progress.
By 1885 many of the leading British millers had installed full
roller plants, and in the succeeding ten years small roller plants
were installed in many country mills. For a time there was a
transition stage in which there was in operation a number of so-called
&ldquo;combined&rdquo; plants, that is to say, mills in which the
wheat was broken on millstones or disk mills, while the middlings
were reduced by smooth rolls; but these gradually dropped out
of being.

Well-found British flour mills at the present time are probably
the best fitted in the world, and as a whole have nothing to fear
from comparison with their American competitors. It is true
that American millers were rather quicker to copy Hungarian
milling methods so far as gradual reduction was concerned.
But from about 1880 the British miller was quite awake to his
position and was straining every nerve to provide himself with
a plant capable of dealing with every kind of wheat. It has
often been said that he commands the wheat of the whole world.
This is true in a sense, but it is not true that he can always
command the exact kind of wheat he requires at the price
required to meet foreign competition. Therein he is at a disadvantage.
But engineers have done their best to meet this
weak point, and by their assistance he is able to compete under
almost all conditions with the millers of the whole world.

Processes of Milling.&mdash;Fully to appreciate the various processes
of modern milling, it must be remembered not only that the
wheat as delivered at the mill is dusty and mixed with sand and
even more objectionable refuse, but also that it contains many
light grains and seeds of other plants. It is not therefore sufficient
for the miller to be able to reduce the grain to flour on the most
approved principles; he must also have at command the means
of freeing it from foreign substances, and further of &ldquo;conditioning&rdquo;
it, should it be damp or over dry and harsh. Again, his
operations must be conducted with reference to the structure
of the wheat grain. The wheat berry is a fruit, not a seed, the
actual seed being the germ or embryo, a kidney-shaped body
which is found at the base of the berry and is connected with
the plumule or root. The germ is tough in texture and is in
roller milling easily separated from the rest of the berry, being
flattened instead of crushed by the rolls and thus readily sifted
from the stock. The germ contains a good deal of fatty matter,
which, if allowed to remain, would not increase the keeping
qualities of the flour. Botanists distinguish five skins on the
berry&mdash;epidermis, epicarp, endicarp, episperm and embryous
membrane&mdash;but for practical purposes the number of integuments
may be taken as three. The inner skin is often as thick as the
outer and second skins together, which are largely composed
of woody fibre; it contains the cerealin or aleurone cells, but
although these are made up of a certain proportion of proteids,
on account of the discolouring and diastasic action of the cerealin
in flour they are best eliminated. The endosperm, or floury
kernel, coming next to the inner skin, consists of starch granules
which are caught as it were in the minute meshes of a net. This
network is the gluten, and it may be noted that these meshes
are not of equal consistency throughout the berry, but are
usually finer and more dense near the husk than in the interior
of the kernel. This glutinous portion is of great importance
to the baker because on its quantity and quality depends the
&ldquo;strength&rdquo; or rising power of the flour, and the aim of modern
roller milling is to retain it as completely as possible, a matter
of some difficulty owing to its close adherence to the husk,
especially in the richest wheats. Another organ of the wheat
berry which has a most important bearing on the work of the
miller is the placenta, which is in effect a cord connecting the
berry with its stalk or straw. The placenta serves to filter the
food which the plant sucks up from the ground; it passes up
the crease of the berry, and is enfolded in the middle skin, being
protected on the outer side by the first and having the third
or inner skin on its other side. A good deal of the matters
filtered by the placenta are mineral in their nature, and such
portions as are not digested remain in the crease. This is the
matter which millers call &ldquo;crease dirt.&rdquo; It is highly discolouring
to flour, and must be carefully eliminated. The fuzzy end of the
berry known as the beard also has a distinct function; its hairs
are in reality tubes which serve to carry off superfluous moisture.
They have, in common with the bran, no nutritive value. (See
also Wheat.)


In the old &ldquo;flat&rdquo; or &ldquo;low&rdquo; milling the object was to grind as
perfectly as possible, at one operation, the central substance of the
grain, constituting the flour, and to separate it from the embryo and
outer skins constituting the bran. In &ldquo;high&rdquo; milling, on the other
hand, the grinding is effected in a series of operations, the aim
being to get as much semolina and middlings as possible from the
wheat, and to make as little flour as possible during the earlier or
&ldquo;breaking&rdquo; part of the process. It is impossible altogether to
avoid the production of flour at this stage, but properly set and
worked break-rolls will make as little as 15% of &ldquo;break-flour,&rdquo;
which is of less value, being contaminated with crease dirt, and
also because it is weak owing to the absence of the gluten cells which
adhere more readily to the middlings. Whole wheaten flour, sometimes
called Graham flour, consists of the entire grain ground up
to a uniform mass.

Wheat cleaning has been well called the foundation of all good
milling. In the screen house, as the wheat-cleaning department
of the mill is termed, will be found an array of machinery
almost equal in range and variety to that in the mill
Dry cleaning.
itself. The wheat, drawn by an elevator from the barge,
or hoisted in sacks, is first treated by a machine known as a warehouse
separator. This apparatus accomplishes its work by means
of flat sieves, some of which will be of much coarser mesh than
others, and of air currents, the adjustment of which is a more delicate
task than might appear. The warehouse separator serves to free
dirty wheat of such impurities as lumps of earth, stones, straws and
sand, not to mention small seeds, also some maize, oats and barley.
Great care has to be exercised in all operations of the screen house
lest wheat should pass away with the screenings. Besides the
warehouse separator, which is made in different types and sizes,
grading and sorting cylinders, and what are known as cockle and
barley cylinders, are much used in the screen house. These cylinders
are provided with indents so shaped and of such size as to catch
seeds which are smaller than wheat, and reject grains, as of barley or
oats, which are longer than wheat. Sorting cylinders should be
followed by machines known as scourers, the function of which is to
free the wheat from adherent impurities. These machines are of
different types, but all depend on percussive action. A vertical
scourer consists of a number of steel or iron beaters attached to a
vertical spindle which revolves inside a metallic woven or perforated
casing, the whole being fitted with an effectual exhaust. Scourers
with horizontal spindles are also in great favour. Not every wheat
is suitable for scouring, but some wheats are so mingled with impurities
that a severe action between the beaters and the perforated
case is absolutely necessary. The most efficient scourer is that which
frees the wheat from the greatest amount of impurity with a minimum
of abrasion. The beaters should be adjustable to suit different
kinds of wheat. Scourers are followed by brush machines which
are similar to the last and are of three distinct types: solid, divided
and cone brushes. In the solid variety the brush surface is continuous
around the circumference of a revolving cylinder; in divided
brushes there is often a set of beaters or bars covered with brush
but leaving intermediate spaces; while the cone brush consists of
beaters covered with fibre arranged like cones around a vertical
spindle. The object of all these brushes, the cylinder containing
them being fitted with an exhaust fan, is to polish the wheat and
remove adhering impurities which the percussive action of the
scourer may have failed to eliminate, also to remove the beard or
fuzzy end and any loose portions of the outer husk. But the miller
must be careful not to overdo the scouring action and unnecessarily
abrade the berry, else he will have trouble with his flour, the triturated
bran breaking under the rolls and producing powder which
will discolour the break flour. To remove such metallic fragments
as nails, pieces of wire, &amp;c., magnets are used. These may either
551
be of horseshoe shape, in which case they are usually set at the head
of the wheat spouts, or they may consist of magnetized plates set
at angles over which the wheat will slide. It is not a bad plan to
place the magnets just before the first set of break-rolls, where they
should ensure the arrest of steel and iron particles, which might
otherwise get between the rolls and spoil the edges of their grooves,
and also do damage to the sifting machines. Mention must also
be made of the automatic scales which are used to check the milling
value of the wheat. In principle these machines are all the same,
though details of construction may vary. Each weigher is set for
a given weight of grain. As soon as the receiving hopper has
poured through a valve into the recipient or skip, which is hung at
one end of a beam scale, a load of grain sufficient to overcome the
weight hung at the other end of the beam, the inlet of grain is automatically
cut off and the skip is discharged, automatically returning
to take another charge. Each weighing is automatically recorded
on a dial. In this way a record can be kept of the gross weight of
the uncleaned wheat entering the warehouse and of the net weight
of the cleaned wheat. The difference between the two weighings
will, of course, represent the loss by cleaning. The percentage of
flour obtained from a given wheat can be ascertained in the mill
itself. In practice the second weigher is placed just before the
first break.

The cleansing of wheat by washing only became a fine art at the
close of the 19th century, though it was practised in the north of
England some twenty years earlier. Briefly it may be said
that certain wheats are washed to free them from extraneous
Wet cleaning and conditioning.
matters such as adherent earth and similar impurities
which could not be removed by dry cleaning without
undue abrasion. Such wheats are Indians, Persians and
hard Russians, and these require not only washing but also conditioning,
by which is meant mellowing, before going to the rolls. With
another class of wheats, such as the softer Russians and Indians,
spring Americans and Canadians, hard American winters, Californians
and the harder River Plates, washing and conditioning by
heat is also desirable, though care must be exercised not to let the
moisture penetrate into the endosperm or floury portion of the
kernel. In a third and distinct class fall soft wheats, such as many
kinds of Plates, soft Russians and English wheat. It is generally
admitted that while wheat of the first two divisions will benefit from
the application of both moisture and heat, wheat of the third class
must be washed with great circumspection. The object of washing
machines is to agitate the wheat in water till the adherent foreign
matters are washed off and any dirt balls broken up and drained off
in the waste water. To this end some washers are fitted with Archimedean
worm conveyors set either at an inclined angle or horizontally
or vertically; or the washer may consist of a barrel revolving
in a tank partly filled with water. Another function of washing
machines is to separate stones of the same size which are found in
several varieties of wheat. This separation is effected by utilizing
a current of water as a balance strong enough to carry wheat but not
strong enough to carry stones or bodies of greater specific gravity
than wheat. This current may be led up an inclined worm or may
flow horizontally over a revolving tray. The washer is followed
by a whizzer, which is an apparatus intended to free the berry by
purely mechanical means from superfluous moisture. The typical
whizzer is a vertical column fed at the bottom and delivering at the
top. The wet wheat ascends by centrifugal force in a spiral direction
round the column to the top, and by the time it is discharged from
the spout at the top it has thrown off from its outer skin almost
all its moisture, the water escaping through the perforated cover
of the machine. But there still remains a certain amount of water
which has penetrated the integuments more or less deeply, and to
condition the berry it is treated by a combination of hot and cold air.
The wheat is passed between perforated metal plates and subjected
to a draught first of hot and then of cold air. The perforated plates
are usually built in the shape of a column, or leg as it is often called,
and this is provided with two air chambers, an upper one serving
as a reservoir for hot, and the lower for cold air. The air from both
chambers is discharged by pressure through the descending layers
of wheat, which should not be more than an inch thick; the air is
drawn in by a steel-plate fan, which is often provided with a divided
casing, one side being used for cold, and the other for hot air. Coupled
with the hot air side is a heater consisting of a series of circulating
steam-heated pipes. The temperature of the heated air can be
regulated by the supply of steam to the heater. This process of
washing and conditioning, one of the most important in a flour
mill, is characteristically British; millers have to deal with wheats
of the most varied nature, and one object of conditioning is to bring
hard and harsh, soft and weak wheats as nearly as possible to a
common standard of condition before being milled. Wheat is sometimes
washed to toughen the bran, an end which can also be attained
by damping it from a spraying pipe as it passes along an inclined
worm. Another way of toughening bran is to pass wheat through
a heated cylinder, while again another process known as steaming
consists of injecting steam into wheat as it passes through a metal
hopper. Here the object is to cleanse to some extent, and to warm
and soften (by the condensation of moisture on the grain), but these
processes are imperfect substitutes for a full washing and conditioning
plant. Hard wheats will not be injured by a fairly long immersion
in water, always provided the subsequent whizzing and drying
are efficiently carried out. The second class of semi-hard wheats
already mentioned must be run more quickly through the washer
and freed from the water as rapidly as possible. Still more is this
necessary with really soft wheats, such as soft River Plates and the
softer English varieties. Here an immersion of only a few seconds
is desirable, while the moisture left by the water must be immediately
and energetically thrown off by the whizzer before the grain enters
the drier. Treated thus, soft wheats may be improved by washing.
It is claimed that hard wheats, like some varieties of Indians, are
positively improved in flavour by conditioning, and this is probably
true; certain it is that English country millers, in seasons when
native wheat was scarce and dear, and Indian wheat was abundant
and cheap, have found the latter, mellowed by conditioning, to be
an excellent substitute.

Wheats which have been exposed to the action of water during
harvest do not necessarily yield unsound flour; the matter is a
question of the amount of moisture absorbed. But it
must be remembered that it is not so much the water
Effect of damp.
itself which degrades the constituents of the wheat
(starch and gluten) as the chemical changes which the dampness
produces. Hence perhaps the best remedy which can be found for
damp wheat is to dry it as soon as it has been harvested, either by
kiln or steam drier at a heat not exceeding 120Â° F., until the moisture
has been reduced to 10% of the whole grain. The flour made from
wheat so treated may be weak, but will not usually be unsound.
The practice of drying damp flour has also good results. Long before
the roller milling period it was found that only flour which had been
dried (in a kiln) could safely be taken on long sea voyages, especially
when the vessel had to navigate warm latitudes. It may be noted
that in the days of millstone milling it was far more difficult to
produce good keeping flour. The wheat berry being broken up
and triturated in one operation, the flour necessarily contained a
large proportion of branny particles in which cerealin, an active
diastasic constituent, was present in very sensible proportions.
Again, the elimination of the germ by the roller process is favourable
to the production of a sounder flour, because the germ contains a
large amount of oleaginous matter and has a strong diastasic action
on imperfectly matured starches. The tendency of flours containing
germ to become rancid is well marked. During the South African
War of 1899-1902 the British army supply department had a
practical proof of the diastasic action of branny particles in flour.
Soldiers&rsquo; bread is not usually of white colour, and the military
authorities not unnaturally believed that comparatively low-grade
flour, if sound, was eminently suitable for use in the field bakeries.
But in the climate of South Africa flour of this description soon
developed considerable acidity. Ultimately the supply department
gave up buying any but the driest patent flours, and it is understood
that the most suitable flour proved to be certain patents milled
in Minneapolis, U.S.A., from hard spring wheat. Not only did they
contain a minimum of branny and fibrous matters, but they were
also the driest that could be found.

After being cleaned the wheat berry is split and broken up into
increasingly fine pieces by fluted rolls or &ldquo;breaks.&rdquo; In the earlier
years of roller milling it was usual to employ more breaks
than is now the case. The first pair of break-rolls used
Break-rolls.
to be called the splitting rolls, because their function was
supposed to be to split the berry longitudinally down its crease, so as
to give the miller an opportunity of removing the dirt between the
two lobes of the berry by means of a brush machine. The dirt was
in many cases no more than the placenta already described, which
shrivelling up took, like all vegetable fibre, a dark tint. The neat
split along the crease was not, however, achieved in more than 10%
of the berries so treated. Where such rolls are still in use they are
really serving as a sort of adjunct to the wheat-cleaning system.
Four or five breaks are now thought sufficient, but three breaks are
not recommended, except in very short systems for small country
mills. Rolls are now used up to 60 in. in length, though in one of
the most approved systems they never exceed 40 in.; they are made
of chilled iron, and for the breaking of wheat are provided with
grooving cut at a slight twist, the spiral averaging Â¼ in. to the foot
length, though for the last set of break-rolls, which clean up the bran,
the spiral is sometimes increased to Â½ in. per foot. The grooves
should have sharp edges because they do better work than when
blunt, giving larger semolina and middlings, with bran adherent in
big flakes; small middlings, that is, little pieces of the endosperm
torn away by blunt grooves, and comminuted bran, make the production
of good class flour almost impossible; cut bran, moreover,
brings less money. The break-rolls should never work by pressure,
but nip the material fed between them at a given point; to cut or
shear, not to flatten and crush, is their function. Rolls may be set
either horizontally or vertically; an oblique setting has also come
into favour. The feed is of the utmost importance to the correct
working of a roller mill. The material should be fed in an even
stream, not too thick, and leaving no part of the roll uncovered.
The two rolls of each pair are run at unequal speeds, 2Â½ to 1 being
the usual ratio on the three first breaks, while the last break is often
speeded at 3 to 1 or 3Â½ to 1; in one of the oblique mills the difference
is obtained by making the diameter of one roll 13 and of the other 10
in. and running them at equal speed. For break-rolls up to 36 in. in
552
length 9 in. is the usual diameter; for longer rolls 10 in. is the
standard. To do good work rolls must run in perfect parallelism;
otherwise some parts of the material will pass untouched, while
others will be treated too severely.

The products of the break-rolls are treated by what are known
as scalpers, which are simply machines for sorting out these products
for further treatment. Scalpers may either be revolving
reels or flat sieves. The sieve is the favourite form of
Scalpers.
scalper on account of its gentle action. Scalping requires a separating
and sifting, not a scouring action. The break products are
usually separated on a sieve covered with wire or perforated zinc
plates. Generally speaking, two sieves are in one frame and are run
at a slight incline. The throughs of the top sieve fall on the sieve
below, while the rejections or overtails of the first sieve are fed to the
next break. The &ldquo;throughs,&rdquo; or what has passed this sieve, are
graded by the next sieve, the tailings going to a purifier, while the
throughs may be freed from what flour adheres to them by a centrifugal
dressing machine and then treated by another purifier. A
form of scalper which has come into general use on the continent
of Europe, and to a lesser extent in Great Britain and America, is
known as the plansifter. This machine, of Hungarian origin, is
simply a collection of superimposed flat sieves in one box, and will
scalp or sort out any kind of break stock very efficiently. A system
of grading the tailings, that is, the rejections of the scalpers, introduced
by James Harrison Carter (Carter-Zimmer patent), was known
as pneumatic sorting. Its object was to supplement the work of
the scalpers by classifying the tailings by means of air-currents.
To this end each scalper was followed by a machine arranged somewhat
like a gravity purifier; that is to say, a current of air drawn
through the casing of the sorter allowed the heaviest and best
material to drop down straight, while the lighter stuff was deposited
in one or other of further compartments formed by obliquely placed
adjustable cant boards. So searching was this grading, that from
the first sorter of a four-break plant four separations would be
obtained, the first going to the second break, the second joining the
first separation from the second sorter and being fed to the third
break, while the third went with the best separation of the third
sorter to the fourth break, and the last separation from all the
sorters went straight into the bran sack. The work of the break-rolls
was greatly simplified and reduced by this sorting process, as
each particle of broken wheat went exactly to that pair of break-rollers
for which it was suitable, instead of all the material being
run indiscriminately through all the break-rollers and thereby being
cut up with the necessary result of increasing the production of
small bran.

The object of the purifier, a machine on which milling engineers
have lavished much thought and labour, is to get away from the
semolina and middlings as much impure matter as possible,
that those products may be pure, as millers say, for
Purifiers.
reduction to flour by the smooth rolls. The purifiers used in British
mills take advantage of the fact that the more valuable portions of
the wheat berry are heavier than the less valuable particles, such as
bran and fibrous bodies, and a current of air is employed to weigh
these fragments of the wheat berry as in a balance and to separate
them while they pass over a silk-covered sieve. To this end the
semolina or middlings are fed on a sieve vibrated by an eccentric
and set at a slight downward angle. This sieve is installed in an
air-tight longitudinal wooden chamber with glass windows on either
side, through which the process of purifying can be watched. Upwards
through this sieve a fan constantly draws a current of air,
which, raising the stock upwards, allows the heavier and better
material to remain below while the lighter particles are lifted off
and fall on side platforms or channels, whence they are carried
forward and delivered separately. The good material drops through
the meshes of the silk, and is collected by a worm. It is usual to
clothe the sieve in sections with several different meshes of silk so
that stock of almost identical value, but differing size, may be
treated with uniform accuracy. In good purifiers the strength of
the current can be regulated at will in each section. The tailings of
a purifier do not usually exceed 10 to 15% of the feed. The clothing
of purifier sheets must be nicely graduated to the clothing of the
preceding machines. Repurification and even tertiary purification
may be necessary under certain conditions. In Hungary and other
parts of Europe, gravity purifiers are much in use. Here the material
is guided along an open sieve set at a slight angle, while an air-current
is drawn up at an acute angle. Under the sieve may be arranged
a series of inclined boards, the position of which can be varied
as required. The heaviest and most valuable products resist the
current and drop straight down, while lighter material is carried
off to further divisions.

From the purifier all the stock except the tailings, which may
require other treatment, should go to the smooth rollers to be made
into flour, but here the rollerman will have to exercise
great care and discretion. Many of the remarks already
Smooth rolls.
made in regard to break-rolls apply to smooth rolls,
notably in respect of parallelism. But instead of a cutting action,
the smooth rolls press the material fed to them into flour. This
pressure, however, must be applied with great discrimination, large
semolina with impurities attached requiring quite different treatment
from that called for by small pure middlings. The pressure on
the stock must be just sufficient and no more. Reduction rolls are
usually run at a differential speed of about 2 to 3. The feed must be
carefully graded, because to pass stock of varying size through a
pair of smooth rolls would be fatal to good work. Scratch rolls very
finely grooved are used for cracking impure semolina or for reducing
the tailings of purifiers. The latter often hold fragments of bran,
which are best detached by rolls grooved about 36 to the inch and
run at a differential of 3 to 1. The reduction requires even more
roll surface than the break system. To do first-class work a mill
should have at least 35 to 40 in. on the breaks and 50 in. on the
reduction for each sack of 280 &#8468; of flour per hour. Many engineers
consider 100 to 110 in. on the break, scratch and smooth rolls not
too much.

The dressing out of the flour from the stock reduced on smooth
rolls is generally effected by centrifugal machines, which consist
of a slowly revolving cylinder provided with an internal
shaft on which are keyed a number of iron beaters that
Dressing.
run at a speed of about 200 revolutions a minute, and fling the feed
against the silk clothing of the cylinder. What goes through the silk
is collected by a worm conveyor at the bottom of the machine.
Most centrifugals have so-called &ldquo;cut-off&rdquo; sheets, with internal
divisions in the tail end; these are intended to separate some
intermediate products, which, having been freed from floury particles,
are treated on some other machine, such as a pair of rolls either
direct or after a purifier. The centrifugal is undoubtedly an efficient
flour separator, but the plansifters already mentioned are also good
flour-dressers, especially in dry climates. A plansifter mill will have
no centrifugals, except one or two at the tail end where the material
gets more sticky and requires more severe treatment.

The yield of flour obtained in a British roller mill averages 70 to
73% of the wheat berry. The residue, with the exception of a very
small proportion of waste, is offal, which is divided into various
grades and sold. Profitable markets for British-made bran have
been found in Scandinavia, and especially in Denmark. In millstone
milling the yield of flour probably averaged 75 to 80%, but
a certain proportion of this was little more than offal. The length of
the flour yield taken by British millers varies in different parts of
the kingdom, because demand varies. In one locality high-class
patents may be at a premium; in another the call is for a straight
grade, i.e. a flour containing as much of the farinaceous substance
as can be won from the wheat berry. In one district there is a sale
for rich offals, that is, offals with plenty of flour adhering; in another
there may be no demand for such offals. Hence, though the general
principles of roller milling as given above hold good all over the
country, yet in practice the work of each mill is varied more or less
to suit the peculiarities of the local trade.

Early in the 19th century a French chemist, J.J.E. Poutet,
discovered that nitrous acid and oxides of nitrogen act on some
fluid and semi-fluid vegetable oils, removing their yellow
tinge and converting a considerable portion of their substance
Bleaching of flour.
into a white solid. The importance of this discovery,
when the physical constitution of wheat is considered, is
obvious, but it was years before any attempt was made to bleach
flour. The first attempts at bleaching seem to have been made on
the wheat itself rather than on the flour. In 1879 a process was
patented for bleaching grain by means of chlorine gas, and about
1891 a suggestion was made for bleaching grain by means of electrolysed
sea-water. In 1895 a scheme was put forward for treating
grain with sulphurous acid, and about two years later it was proposed
to subject both grain and flour to the influence of electric
currents. In 1893 a patent was granted for the purification of flour
by means of fresh air or oxygen, and three years later another inventor
proposed to employ the RÃ¶ntgen rays for the same purpose.
In 1898 Emile Frichot took out a patent for using ozone and ozonized
air for flour-bleaching. The patent (No. 1661 of 1901) taken out by
J. &amp; S. Andrews of Belfast recited that flour is known to improve
greatly if kept for some time after grinding, and the purpose of the
invention it covered was to bring about this improvement or conditioning
not only immediately after grinding, but also to a greater
extent than can be effected by keeping. The process consisted in
subjecting the flour to the action of a suitable gaseous oxidizing
medium; the inventors preferred air carrying a minute quantity
of nitric acid or peroxide of nitrogen, but they did not confine themselves
to those compounds, having found that chlorine, bromine
and other substances capable of liberating oxygen were also more
or less efficacious. They claimed that while exercising no deleterious
action their treatment made the flour whiter, improved its baking
qualities, and rendered it less liable to be attacked by mites or other
organisms. Under the patent, No. 14006 of 1903, granted to J.N.
Alsop of Kentucky the flour was treated with atmospheric air
which had been subjected to the action of an arc or flaming discharge
of electricity, with the purpose of purifying it and improving
its nutritious properties. The Andrews and Alsop patents
became the objects of extended litigation in the English courts,
and it was held that the gaseous medium employed by Alsop was
substantially the same as that employed by Andrews, though
produced electrically instead of chemically, and therefore that the
Alsop process was an infringement of the Andrews patent. Various
other patents for more or less similar processes have also been taken
out.

FLOURENS, GUSTAVE (1838-1871), French revolutionist
and writer, a son of J.P. Flourens (1794-1867), the physiologist,
was born at Paris on the 4th of August 1838. In 1863 he undertook
for his father a course of lectures at the CollÃ¨ge de France,
the subject of which was the history of mankind. His theories
as to the manifold origin of the human race, however, gave
offence to the clergy, and he was precluded from delivering a
second course. He then went to Brussels, where he published
his lectures under the title of Histoire de l&rsquo;homme (1863); he
next visited Constantinople and Athens, took part in the Cretan
insurrection of 1866, spent some time in Italy, where an article
of his in the Popolo d&rsquo;Italia caused his arrest and imprisonment,
and finally, having returned to France, nearly lost his life in a
duel with Paul de Cassagnac, editor of the Pays. In Paris he
devoted his pen to the cause of republicanism, and at length,
having failed in an attempt to organize a revolution at Belleville
on the 7th of February 1870, found himself compelled to flee
from France. Returning to Paris on the downfall of Napoleon, he
soon placed himself at the head of a body of 500 tirailleurs. On
account of his insurrectionary proceedings he was taken prisoner
at CrÃ©teil, near Vincennes, by the provisional government, and
confined at Mazas on the 7th of December 1870, but was released
by his men on the night of January 21-22. On the 18th of
March he joined the Communists. He was elected a member of
the commune by the 20th arrondissement, and was named colonel.
He was one of the most active leaders of the insurrection, and in
a sortie against the Versailles troops in the morning of the 3rd
of April was killed in a hand-to-hand conflict at Rueil, near
Malmaison. Besides his Science de l&rsquo;homme (Paris, 1869), Gustave
Flourens was the author of numerous fugitive pamphlets.

FLOURENS, MARIE JEAN PIERRE (1794-1867), French
physiologist, was born at Maureilhan, near BÃ©ziers, in the department
of HÃ©rault, on the 15th of April 1794. At the age of fifteen
he began the study of medicine at Montpellier, where in 1823
he received the degree of doctor. In the following year he
repaired to Paris, provided with an introduction from A.P. de
Candolle, the botanist, to Baron Cuvier, who received him
kindly, and interested himself in his welfare. At Paris Flourens
engaged in physiological research, occasionally contributing to
literary publications; and in 1821, at the AthÃ©nÃ©e there, he
gave a course of lectures on the physiological theory of the
sensations, which attracted much attention amongst men of
science. His paper entitled Recherches expÃ©rimentales sur les
propriÃ©tÃ©s et les fonctions du systÃ¨me nerveux dans les animaux
vertÃ©brÃ©s, in which he, from experimental evidence, sought to
assign their special functions to the cerebrum, corpora quadrigemina
and cerebellum, was the subject of a highly commendatory
report by Cuvier, adopted by the French Academy of Sciences
in 1822. He was chosen by Cuvier in 1828 to deliver for him a
course of lectures on natural history at the CollÃ¨ge de France,
and in the same year became, in succession to L.A.G. Bosc, a
member of the Institute, in the division &ldquo;Ã‰conomie rurale.&rdquo;
In 1830 he became Cuvier&rsquo;s substitute as lecturer on human
anatomy at the Jardin du Roi, and in 1832 was elected to the
post of titular professor, which he vacated for the professorship
of comparative anatomy created for him at the museum of the
Jardin the same year. In 1833 Flourens, in accordance with the
dying request of Cuvier, was appointed a perpetual secretary of
the Academy of Sciences; and in 1838 he was returned as a
deputy for the arrondissement of BÃ©ziers. In 1840 he was elected,
in preference to Victor Hugo, to succeed J.F. Michaud at the
French Academy; and in 1845 he was created a commander of
the legion of honour, and in the next year a peer of France.
In March 1847 Flourens directed the attention of the Academy
of Sciences to the anaesthetic effect of chloroform on animals.
On the revolution of 1848 he withdrew completely from political
life; and in 1855 he accepted the professorship of natural history
at the CollÃ¨ge de France. He died at Montgeron, near Paris,
on the 6th of December 1867.


Besides numerous shorter scientific memoirs, Flourens published&mdash;Essai
sur quelques points de la doctrine de la rÃ©vulsion et de la dÃ©rivation
(Montpellier, 1813); ExpÃ©riences sur le systÃ¨me nerveux (Paris,
1825); Cours sur la gÃ©nÃ©ration, l&rsquo;ovologie, et l&rsquo;embryologie (1836);

FLOWER, SIR WILLIAM HENRY (1831-1899), English
biologist, was born at Stratford-on-Avon on the 30th of November
1831. Choosing medicine as his profession, he began his studies
at University College, London, where he showed special aptitude
for physiology and comparative anatomy and took his M.B.
degree in 1851. He then joined the Army Medical Service, and
went out to the Crimea as assistant-surgeon, receiving the medal
with four clasps. On his return to England he became a member
of the surgical staff of the Middlesex hospital, London, and in
1861 succeeded J.T. Quekett as curator of the Hunterian
Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. In 1870
he also became Hunterian professor, and in 1884, on the death
of Sir Richard Owen, was appointed to the directorship of the
Natural History Museum at South Kensington. He died in
London on the 1st of July 1899. He made valuable contributions
to structural anthropology, publishing, for example, complete
and accurate measurements of no less than 1300 human skulls,
and as a comparative anatomist he ranked high, devoting
himself especially to the study of the mammalia. He was also
a leading authority on the arrangement of museums. The greater
part of his life was spent in their administration, and in consequence
he held very decided views as to the principles upon
which their specimens should be set out. He insisted on the
importance of distinguishing between collections intended for
the use of specialists and those designed for the instruction of the
general public, pointing out that it was as futile to present
to the former a number of merely typical forms as to provide
the latter with a long series of specimens differing only in the
most minute details. His ideas, which were largely and successfully
applied to the museums of which he had charge, gained wide
approval, and their influence entitles him to be looked upon as a
reformer who did much to improve the methods of museum
arrangement and management. In addition to numerous original
papers, he was the author of An Introduction to the Osteology of the
Mammalia (1870); Fashion in Deformity (1881); The Horse:
a Study in Natural History (1890); Introduction to the Study of
Mammals, Living and Extinct (1891); Essays on Museums and
other Subjects (1898). He also wrote many articles for the ninth
edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.



FLOWER (Lat. flos, floris; Fr. fleur), a term popularly used
for the bloom or blossom of a plant, and so by analogy for the
fairest, choicest or finest part or aspect of anything, and in various
technical senses. Here we shall deal only with its botanical
interest. It is impossible to give a rigid botanical definition
of the term &ldquo;flower.&rdquo; The flower is a characteristic feature of
the highest group of the plant kingdom&mdash;the flowering plants
(Phanerogams)&mdash;and is the name given to the association of
organs, more or less leaf-like in form, which are concerned with
the production of the fruit or seed. In modern botanical works
the group is often known as the seed-plants (Spermatophyta).
As the seed develops from the ovule which has been fertilized
by the pollen, the essential structures for seed-production are
two, viz. the pollen-bearer or stamen and the ovule-bearer or
carpel. These are with few exceptions foliar structures, known
in comparative morphology as sporophylls, because they bear
the spores, namely, the microspores or pollen-grains which are
developed in the microsporangia or pollen-sacs, and the megaspore,
which is contained in the ovule or megasporangium.

In Gymnosperms (q.v.), which represent the more primitive
554
type of seed-plants, the micro- or macro-sporophylls are generally
associated, often in large numbers, in separate cones, to which
the term &ldquo;flower&rdquo; has been applied. But there is considerable
difference of opinion as to the relation between these cones
and the more definite and elaborate structure known as the
flower in the higher group of seed-plants&mdash;the Angiosperms (q.v.)&mdash;and
it is to this more definite structure that we generally refer
in using the term &ldquo;flower.&rdquo;

    leaves.

    expense of the stamens,
    which are reduced in
    number.
c, Coloured leaves representing
    abortive carpels.
a, Axis prolonged, bearing an

    apex.

Flowers are produced from flower-buds, just as leaf-shoots
arise from leaf-buds. These two kinds of buds have a resemblance
to each other as regards the arrangement and the development
of their parts; and it sometimes happens, from injury and
other causes, that the part of the axis which, in ordinary cases,
would produce a leaf-bud, gives origin to a flower-bud. A
flower-bud has not in ordinary circumstances any power of
extension by the continuous development
of its apex. In this
respect it differs from a leaf-bud.
In some cases, however, of monstrosity,
especially seen in the rose
(fig. 1), the central part is prolonged,
and bears leaves or flowers.
In such cases the flowers, so far as
their functional capabilities are
concerned, are usually abortive.
This phenomenon is known as proliferation
of the floral axis.

Flower-buds, like leaf-buds, are
produced in the axil of leaves,
which are called bracts.

The term bract is properly applied
to the leaf from which the primary
floral axis, whether
simple or branched,
arises, while the leaves which arise
on the axis between the bract and
the outer envelope of the flower
Bracts.
are bracteoles or bractlets. Bracts
sometimes do not differ from
the ordinary leaves, as in Veronica
hederifolia, Vinca, Anagallis and
Ajuga. In general as regards their
form and appearance they differ
from ordinary leaves, the difference
being greater in the upper than
in the lower branches of an inflorescence.
They are distinguished
by their position at the base of
the flower or flower-stalk. Their
arrangement is similar to that of
the leaves. When the flower is sessile the bracts are often
applied closely to the calyx, and may thus be confounded with
it, as in the order Malvaceae and species of Dianthus and winter
aconite (Eranthis), where they have received the name of epicalyx
or calyculus. In some Rosaceous plants an epicalyx is present,
due to the formation of stipulary structures by the sepals. In
many cases bracts act as protective organs, within or beneath
which the young flowers are concealed in their earliest stage of
growth.

When bracts become coloured, as in Amherstia nobilis,
Euphorbia splendens, Erica elegans and Salvia splendens, they
may be mistaken for parts of the corolla. They are sometimes
mere scales or threads, and at other times are undeveloped,
giving rise to the ebracteate inflorescence of Cruciferae and some
Boraginaceae. Sometimes they are empty, no flower-buds
being produced in their axil. A series of empty coloured bracts
terminates the inflorescence of Salvia Horminum. The smaller
bracts or bracteoles, which occur among the subdivisions of a
branching inflorescence, often produce no flower-buds, and thus
anomalies occur in the floral arrangements. Bracts are occasionally
persistent, remaining long attached to the base of the
peduncles, but more usually they are deciduous, falling off early
by an articulation. In some instances they form part of the
fruit, becoming incorporated with other organs. Thus, the cones
of firs and the stroboli of the hop are composed of a series of
spirally arranged bracts covering fertile flowers; and the scales
on the fruit of the pine-apple are of the same nature. At the
base of the general umbel in umbelliferous plants a whorl of
bracts often exists, called a general involucre, and at the base
of the smaller umbels or umbellules there is a similar leafy whorl
called an involucel or partial involucre. In some instances, as in
fool&rsquo;s-parsley, there is no general involucre, but simply an
involucel; while in other cases, as in fennel or dill (fig. 15),
neither involucre nor involucel is developed. In Compositae
the name involucre is applied to the bracts surrounding the head
of flowers (fig. 2, i), as in marigold, dandelion, daisy, artichoke.
This involucre is frequently composed of several rows of leaflets,
which are either of the same or of different forms and lengths,
and often lie over each other in an imbricated manner. The
leaves of the involucre are spiny in thistles and in teazel (Dipsacus),
and hooked in burdock. Such whorled or verticillate
bracts generally remain separate (polyphyllous), but may be
united by cohesion (gamophyllous), as in many species of Bupleurum
and in Lavatera. In Compositae besides the involucre
there are frequently chaffy and setose bracts at the base of each
flower, and in Dipsacaceae a membranous tube surrounds each
flower. These structures are of the nature of an epicalyx. In
the acorn the cupule or cup (fig. 3) is formed by a growing
upwards of the flower-stalk immediately beneath the flower,
upon which scaly or spiny protuberances appear; it is of the
nature of bracts. Bracts also compose the husky covering of
the hazel-nut.

Marigold (Calendula), showing
a congeries of flowers, enclosed

which are collectively called an

When bracts become united, and overlie each other in several
rows, it often happens that the outer ones do not produce flowers,
that is, are empty or sterile. In the artichoke the outer imbricated
scales or bracts are in this condition, and it is from the
membranous white scales or bracts (paleae) forming the choke
attached to the edible receptacle that the flowers are produced.
The sterile bracts of the daisy occasionally produce capitula,
and give rise to the hen-and-chickens daisy. In place of developing
flower-buds, bracts may, in certain circumstances, as in
proliferous or viviparous plants, produce leaf-buds.

Fig. 6.&mdash;Peduncle of Fig
(Ficus Carica), ending in a
hollow receptacle, enclosing
numerous male and female
flowers.

A sheathing bract enclosing one or several flowers is called
a spathe. It is common among Monocotyledons, as Narcissus
(fig. 4), snow-flake, Arum and palms. In some palms it is 20
ft. long, and encloses 200,000 flowers. It is often associated
with that form of inflorescence termed the spadix, and may be
coloured, as in Anthurium, or white, as in arum lily (Richardia
aethiopica). When the spadix is compound or branching, as in
palms, there are smaller spathes, surrounding separate parts of
the inflorescence. The spathe protects the flowers in their young
state, and often falls off after they are developed, or hangs down
555
in a withered form, as in some palms, Typha and Pothos. In
grasses the outer scales or glumes of the spikelets are sterile
bracts (fig. 5, gl); and in Cyperaceae bracts enclose the organs
of reproduction. Bracts are
frequently changed into complete
leaves. This change is
called phyllody of bracts, and
is seen in species of Plantago,
especially in the variety of
Plantago media, called the
rose-plantain in gardens,
where the bracts become leafy
and form a rosette round the
flowering axis. Similar changes
occur in Plantago major, P.
lanceolata, Ajuga reptans,
dandelion, daisy, dahlia and
in umbelliferous plants. The
conversion of bracts into
stamens (staminody of bracts)
has been observed in the case
of Abies excelsa. A lengthening
of the axis of the female
strobilus of Coniferae is not
of infrequent occurrence in
Cryptomeria japonica, larch (Larix europaea), &amp;c., and this is
usually associated with a leaf-like condition of the bracts, and
sometimes even with
the development of
leaf-bearing shoots in
place of the scales.

The arrangement of
the flowers on the axis,
or the ramification of
the floral axis, is called
the inflorescence. The
primary axis of the
inflorescence is sometimes
called the rachis;
its branches, whether
terminal or lateral,
which form the stalks
supporting flowers or
clusters of flowers, are
peduncles, and if small
branches are given off
by it, they are called
pedicels. A flower
having a stalk is called
pedunculate or pedicellate;
one having no stalk is sessile. In describing a branching
inflorescence, it is common to speak of the rachis as the primary
floral axis, its branches as the secondary floral axes, their divisions
as the tertiary floral axes,
and so on; thus avoiding any
confusion that might arise from
the use of the terms rachis, peduncle
and pedicel.

The peduncle is simple, bearing
a single flower, as in primrose;
or branched, as in London-pride.
It is sometimes succulent, as in
the cashew, in which it forms the
large coloured expansion supporting
the nut; spiral, as in
Cyclamen and Vallisneria; or
spiny, as in Alyssum spinosum. When the peduncle proceeds
from radical leaves, that is, from an axis which is so shortened
as to bring the leaves close together in the form of a cluster, as
in the primrose, auricula or hyacinth, it is termed a scape.
The floral axis may be shortened, assuming a flattened, convex
or concave form, and bearing numerous flowers, as in the artichoke,
daisy and fig (fig. 6). The floral axis sometimes appears as
if formed by several peduncles
united together, constituting a
fasciated axis, as in the cockscomb,
in which the flowers form
a peculiar crest at the apex of
the flattened peduncles. Adhesions
occasionally take place
between the peduncle and the
bracts or leaves of the plant, as
in the lime-tree (fig. 7). The
adhesion of the peduncles to the
stem accounts for the extra-axillary
position of flowers, as
in many Solanaceae. When this
union extends for a considerable
length along the stem, several
leaves may be interposed between
the part where the peduncle
becomes free and the leaf
whence it originated, and it may
be difficult to trace the connexion.
The peduncle occasionally
becomes abortive, and in
place of bearing a flower, is transformed
into a tendril; at other
times it is hollowed at the apex,
so as apparently to form the
lower part of the outer whorl of
floral leaves as in Eschscholtzia.
The termination of the peduncle,
or the part on which the whorls
of the flower are arranged, is
called the thalamus, torus or receptacle.

Fig. 9.&mdash;Head of flowers (capitulum)
of Scabiosa atropurpurea. The inflorescence
is simple and indeterminate,
and the expansion of the flowers centripetal,
those at the circumference
opening first.

There are two distinct types of
inflorescence&mdash;one in which the
flowers arise as lateral shoots
from a primary axis, which goes
on elongating, and the lateral
shoots never exceed in their development the length of the
Inflorescence.
primary axis beyond their
point of origin. The flowers
are thus always axillary.
Exceptions, such as in cruciferous
plants, are due to the non-appearance
of the bracts. In the other
type the primary axis terminates
in a single flower, but lateral axes are
given off from the axils of the bracts,
which again repeat the primary axis;
the development of each lateral axis
is stronger than that of the primary
axis beyond its point of origin. The
flowers produced in this inflorescence
are thus terminal. The first kind
of inflorescence is indeterminate,
indefinite or axillary. Here the axis is either elongated,
556
producing flower-buds as it grows, the lower expanding first
(fig. 8), or it is shortened and depressed, and the outer flowers
expand first (fig. 9). The expansion of the flowers is thus
centripetal, that is, from base to apex, or from circumference
to centre.



Fig. 10.&mdash;Plant of Ranunculus
bulbosus, showing determinate
inflorescence.

The second kind of inflorescence is determinate, definite or
terminal. In this the axis is either elongated and ends in a solitary
flower, which thus terminates the axis, and if other flowers are
produced, they belong to secondary axes farther from the centre;
or the axis is shortened and flattened,
producing a number of
separate floral axes, the central
one expanding first, while the
others are developed in succession
farther from the centre. The expansion
of the flowers is in this
case centrifugal, that is, from apex
to base, or from centre to circumference.
It is illustrated in fig. 10,
Ranunculus bulbosus; a&prime; is the
primary axis swollen at the base in
a bulb-like manner b, and with
roots proceeding from it. From
the leaves which are radical proceeds
the axis ending in a solitary
terminal flower f&prime;. About the
middle of this axis there is a leaf
or bract, from which a secondary
floral axis a&Prime; is produced, ending
in a single flower f&Prime;, less advanced
than the flower f&prime;. This secondary
axis bears a leaf also, from which
a tertiary floral axis a&Prime;&prime; is produced,
bearing an unexpanded solitary flower f&Prime;&prime;. From this
tertiary axis a fourth is in progress of formation. Here f&prime; is the
termination of the primary axis, and this flower expands first,
while the other flowers are developed centrifugally on separate
axes.

A third series of inflorescences, termed mixed, may be recognized.
In them the primary axis has an arrangement belonging
to the opposite type from that of the branches, or vice versa.
According to the mode and degree of development of the lateral
shoots and also of the bracts, various forms of both inflorescences
result.

Amongst indefinite forms the simplest occurs when a lateral
shoot produced in the axil of a large single foliage leaf of the plant
ends in a single flower, the axis of the plant elongating beyond,
as in Veronica hederifolia, Vinca minor and Lysimachia nemorum.
The flower in this case is solitary, and the ordinary leaves become
bracts by producing flower-buds in place of leaf-buds; their
number, like that of the leaves of this main axis, is indefinite,
varying with the vigour of the plant. Usually, however, the
floral axis, arising from a more or less altered leaf or bract,
instead of ending in a solitary flower, is prolonged, and bears
numerous bracteoles, from which smaller peduncles are produced,
and those again in their turn may be branched in a similar way.
Thus the flowers are arranged in groups, and frequently very
complicated forms of inflorescence result. When the primary
peduncle or floral axis, as in fig. 8, is elongated, and gives off
pedicels, ending in single flowers, a raceme is produced, as in
currant, hyacinth and barberry. If the secondary floral axes
give rise to tertiary ones, the raceme is branching, and forms a
panicle, as in Yucca gloriosa. If in a raceme the lower flower-stalks
are developed more strongly than the upper, and thus all
the flowers are nearly on a level, a corymb is formed, which may be
simple, as in fig. 11, where the primary axis a&prime; gives off secondary
axes a&Prime;, a&Prime;, which end in single flowers; or branching, where
the secondary axes again subdivide. If the pedicels are very short
or wanting, so that the flowers are sessile, a spike is produced, as
in Plantago and vervain (Verbena officinalis) (fig. 12). If the
spike bears unisexual flowers, as in willow or hazel (fig. 13), it is an
amentum or catkin, hence such trees are called amentiferous; at
other times it becomes succulent, bearing numerous flowers,
surrounded by a sheathing bract or spathe, and then it constitutes
a spadix, which may be simple, as in Arum maculatum (fig. 14),
or branching as in palms. A spike bearing female flowers only,
and covered with scales, is a strobilus, as in the hop. In grasses
there are usually numerous sessile flowers arranged in small
spikes, called locustae or spikelets, which are either set closely
along a central axis, or produced on secondary axes formed by
the branching of the central one; to the latter form the term
panicle is applied.

from the branch by an articulation.

Fig. 15.&mdash;Compound umbel of Common
Dill (Anethum graveolens), having
a primary umbel a, and secondary
umbels b, without either involucre or

If the primary axis, in place of being elongated, is contracted,
it gives rise to other forms of indefinite inflorescence. When the
axis is so shortened that the secondary axes arise from a common
point, and spread out as radii of nearly equal length, each ending
in a single flower or dividing again in a similar radiating manner,
an umbel is produced, as in fig. 15. From the primary floral
axis a the secondary axes come off in a radiating or umbrella-like
manner, and end in small umbels b, which are called partial
umbels or umbellules. This inflorescence is seen in hemlock and
other allied plants, which are hence called umbelliferous. If
there are numerous flowers on a flattened, convex or slightly
concave receptacle, having either very short pedicels or none, a
557
capitulum (head) is formed, as in dandelion, daisy and other
composite plants (fig. 2), also in scabious (fig. 9) and teazel.
In the American button-bush the heads are globular, in some
species of teazel elliptical, while in scabious and in composite
plants, as sunflower, dandelion, thistle, centaury and marigold,
they are somewhat hemispherical, with a flattened, slightly
hollowed, or convex disk. If the margins of such a receptacle
be developed upwards, the centre not developing, a concave
receptacle is formed, which may partially or completely enclose
a number of flowers that are generally unisexual. This gives rise
to the peculiar inflorescence of Dorstenia, or to that of the fig
(fig. 6), where the flowers are placed on the inner surface of the
hollow receptacle, and are provided with bracteoles. This inflorescence
has been called a hypanthodium.

Lastly, we have what are called compound indefinite inflorescences.
In these forms the lateral shoots, developed centripetally
upon the primary axis, bear numerous bracteoles, from which
floral shoots arise which may have a centripetal arrangement
similar to that on the mother shoot, or it may be different. Thus
we may have a group of racemes, arranged in a racemose manner
on a common axis, forming a raceme of racemes or compound
raceme, as in Astilbe. In the same way we may have compound
umbels, as in hemlock and most Umbelliferae (fig. 15), a compound
spike, as in rye-grass, a compound spadix, as in some
palms, and a compound capitulum, as in the hen-and-chickens
daisy. Again, there may be a raceme of capitula, that is, a group
of capitula disposed in a racemose manner, as in Petasites, a
raceme of umbels, as in ivy, and so on, all the forms of inflorescence
being indefinite in disposition. In Eryngium the shortening
of the pedicels changes an umbel into a capitulum.

The simplest form of the definite type of the inflorescence is
seen in Anemone nemorosa and in gentianella (Gentiana acaulis),
where the axis terminates in a single flower, no other flowers
being produced upon the plant. This is a solitary terminal
inflorescence. If other flowers were produced, they would arise
as lateral shoots from the bracts below the first-formed flower.
The general name of cyme is applied to the arrangement of a
group of flowers in a definite inflorescence. A cymose inflorescence
is an inflorescence where the primary floral axis before
terminating in a flower gives off one or more lateral unifloral
axes which repeat the process&mdash;the development being only
limited by the vigour of the plant. The floral axes are thus
centrifugally developed. The cyme, according to its development,
has been characterized as biparous or uniparous. In fig. 16
the biparous cyme is represented in the flowering branch of
Cerastium. Here the primary axis t ends in a flower, which has
passed into the state of fruit. At its base two leaves are produced,
in each of which arise secondary axes t&prime; t&prime;, ending in single flowers,
and at the base of these axes a pair of opposite leaves is produced,
giving rise to tertiary axes t&Prime; t&Prime;, ending in single flowers, and
so on. The term dichasium has also been applied to this form
of cyme.

In the natural order Carophyllaceae (pink family) the dichasial
form of inflorescence is very general. In some members of the
order, as Dianthus barbatus, D. carthusianorum, &amp;c., in which
the peduncles are short, and the flowers closely approximated,
with a centrifugal expansion, the inflorescence has the form of a
contracted dichasium, and receives the name of fascicle. When
the axes become very much shortened, the arrangement is more
complicated in appearance, and the nature of the inflorescence
can only be recognized by the order of opening of the flowers.
In Labiate plants, as the dead-nettle (Lamium), the flowers are
produced in the axil of each of the foliage leaves of the plant,
and they appear as if arranged in a simple whorl of flowers.
But on examination it is found that there is a central flower
expanding first, and from its axis two secondary axes spring
bearing solitary flowers; the expansion is thus centrifugal.
The inflorescence is therefore a contracted dichasium, the flowers
being sessile, or nearly so, and the clusters are called verticillasters
(fig. 17). Sometimes, especially towards the summit of a dichasium,
owing to the exhaustion of the growing power of the
plant, only one of the bracts gives origin to a new axis, the other
remaining empty; thus the inflorescence becomes unilateral,
and further development is arrested. In addition to the dichasial
form there are others where more than two lateral axes are
produced from the primary floral axis, each of which in turn
produces numerous axes. To this form the terms trichasial and
polychasial cyme have been applied; but these are now usually
designated cymose umbels. They are well seen in some species
of Euphorbia. Another term, anthela, has been used to distinguish
such forms as occur in several species of Luzula and
Juncus, where numerous lateral axes arising from the primary
axis grow very strongly and develop in an irregular manner.

 Fig. 17.&mdash;Flowering stalk of the White Dead-nettle (Lamium
album). The bracts are like the ordinary leaves of the plant, and
produce clusters of flowers in their axil. The clusters are called
verticillasters, and consist of flowers which are produced in a centrifugal
manner.

In the uniparous cyme a number of floral axes are successively
developed one from the other, but the axis of each successive
generation, instead of producing a pair of bracts, produces only
one. The basal portion of the consecutive axes may become
much thickened and arranged more or less in a straight line,
558
and thus collectively form an apparent or false axis or sympodium,
and the inflorescence thus simulates a raceme. In the true
raceme, however, we find only a single axis, producing in succession
a series of bracts, from which the floral peduncles arise as
lateral shoots, and thus each flower is on the same side of the
floral axis as the bract in the axil of which it is developed; but
in the uniparous cyme the flower of each of these axes, the basal
portions of which unite to form the false axis, is situated on the
opposite side of the axis to the bract from which it apparently
arises (fig. 18). The bract is not, however, the one from which
the axis terminating in the flower arises, but is a bract produced
upon it, and gives origin in its axil to a new axis, the basal portion
of which, constituting the next part of the false axis, occupies
the angle between this bract and its parent axis&mdash;the bract
from which the axis really does arise being situated lower down
upon the same side of the axis with itself. The uniparous cyme
presents two forms, the scorpioid or cicinal and the helicoid or
bostrychoid.




Fig. 18.&mdash;Helicoid cyme of a species of Alstroemeria. a1, a2, a3, a4,
&amp;c., separate axes successively developed in the axils of the corresponding
bracts b2, b3, b4, &amp;c., and ending in a flower f2, f3, f4, &amp;c. The
whole appears to form a simple raceme of which the axes form the
internodes.

palustris).

Fig. 20.&mdash;Diagram of definite floral axes a, b, c, d, e, &amp;c.

Fig. 21.&mdash;Flowering stalk of Ragwort (Senecio). The flowers are
in heads (capitula), and open from the circumference inwards in an
indefinite centripetal manner. The heads of flowers, on the other
hand, taken collectively, expand centrifugally&mdash;the central one a
first.

In the scorpioid cyme the flowers are arranged alternately in a
double row along one side of the false axis (fig. 19), the bracts
when developed forming a second double row on the opposite
side; the whole inflorescence usually curves on itself like a
scorpion&rsquo;s tail, hence its name. In fig. 20 is shown a diagrammatic
sketch of this arrangement. The false axis, a b c d, is
formed by successive generations of unifloral axes, the flowers
being arranged along one side alternately and in a double row;
had the bracts been developed they would have formed a similar
double row on the opposite side of the false axis; the whole
inflorescence is represented as curved on itself. The inflorescence
in the family Boraginaceae are usually regarded as true scorpioid
cymes.

In the helicoid cyme there is also a false axis formed by the
basal portion of the separate axes, but the flowers are not placed
in a double row, but in a single row, and form a spiral or helix
round the false axis. In Alstroemeria, as represented in fig. 18,
the axis a1 ends in a flower (cut off in the figure) and bears a leaf.
From the axil of this leaf, that is, between it and the primary
axis a1 arises a secondary axis a2, ending in a flower f2, and
producing a leaf about the middle. From the axil of this leaf
a tertiary floral axis a3, ending in a flower f3, takes origin.
In this case the axes are not arranged in two rows along one
side of the false axis, but are placed at regular intervals, so as
to form an elongated spiral round it.

Compound definite inflorescences are by no means common,
but in Streptocarpus polyanthus and in several calceolarias
we probably have examples. Here there are scorpioid cymes of
pairs of flowers, each pair consisting of an older and a younger
flower.

Forms of inflorescence occur, in which both the definite
and indefinite types are represented&mdash;mixed inflorescences.
Thus in Composite plants, such as hawk weeds (Hieracia)
and ragworts (Senecio, fig. 21), the heads of flowers,
Mixed inflorescence.
taken as a whole, are developed centrifugally, the
terminal head first, while the florets, or small flowers
on the receptacle, open centripetally, those at the circumference
first. So also in Labiatae, such as dead-nettle (Lamium), the
different whorls of inflorescence are developed centripetally,
while the florets of the verticillaster are centrifugal. This mixed
character presents difficulties in such cases as Labiatae, where
the leaves, in place of retaining their ordinary form, become
bracts, and thus might lead to the supposition of the whole
series of flowers being one inflorescence. In such cases the cymes
are described as spiked, racemose, or panicled, according to
circumstances. In Saxifraga umbrosa (London-pride) and in
the horse-chestnut we meet with a raceme of scorpioid cymes;
in sea-pink, a capitulum of contracted scorpioid cymes (often
called a glomerulus); in laurustinus, a compound umbel of
dichasial cymes; a scorpioid cyme of capitula in Vernonia
scorpioides. The so-called catkins of the birch are, in reality,
spikes of contracted dichasial cymes. In the bell-flower (Campanula)
there is a racemose uniparous cyme. In the privet
(Ligustrum vulgare) there are numerous racemes of dichasia
arranged in a racemose manner along an axis; the whole inflorescence
thus has an appearance not unlike a bunch of grapes,
and has been called a thyrsus.

The flower consists of the floral axis bearing the sporophylls
(stamens and carpels), usually with certain protective envelopes.
The axis is usually very much
contracted, no internodes
being developed,
and the portion
bearing the floral leaves, termed
The flower.
the thalamus or torus, frequently
expands into a conical, flattened
or hollowed expansion; at other
times, though rarely, the internodes
are developed and it is
elongated. Upon this torus the
parts of the flower are arranged
in a crowded manner, usually
forming a series of verticils, the
parts of which alternate; but
they are sometimes arranged
spirally especially if the floral
axis be elongated. In a typical
flower, as in fig. 22, we recognize
four distinct whorls of leaves:
an outer whorl, the calyx of
sepals; within it, another whorl,
the parts alternating with those
of the outer whorl, the corolla of
petals; next a whorl of parts
alternating with the parts of
the corolla, the androecium of
stamens; and in the centre the
gynoecium of carpels. Fig. 23 is
a diagrammatic representation
of the arrangement of the parts
of such a flower; it is known as
a floral diagram. The flower is
supposed to be cut transversely,
and the parts of each whorl
are distinguished by a different
symbol. Of these whorls the
two internal, forming the sporophylls,
constitute the essential
organs of reproduction; the two
outer whorls are the protective
coverings or floral envelopes. The
sepals are generally of a greenish
colour; their function is mainly
protective, shielding the more
delicate internal organs before
the flower opens. The petals are
usually showy, and normally
alternate with the sepals. Sometimes,
as usually in monocotyledons,
the calyx and corolla are
similar; in such cases the term
perianth, or perigone, is applied.
Thus, in the tulip, crocus, lily,
hyacinth, we speak of the parts of the perianth, in place of
calyx and corolla, although in these plants there is an outer
whorl (calyx), of three parts, and an inner (corolla), of a
similar number, alternating with them. When the parts of
the calyx are in appearance like petals they are said to be
petaloid, as in Liliaceae. In some cases the petals have the
appearance of sepals, then they are sepaloid, as in Juncaceae.
In plants, as Nymphaea alba, where a spiral arrangement of the
floral leaves occurs, it is not easy to say where the calyx ends
and the corolla begins, as these two whorls pass insensibly into
each other. When both calyx and corolla are present, the plants
are dichlamydeous; when one only is present, the flower is
termed monochlamydeous or apetalous, having no petals (fig. 24).
Sometimes both are absent, when the flower is achlamydeous,
or naked, as in willow. The outermost series of the essential
organs, collectively termed the androecium, is composed of the
microsporophylls known as the staminal leaves or stamens. In
their most differentiated form each consists of a stalk, the
filament (fig. 25, f), supporting at its summit the anther
(a), consisting of the pollen-sacs which contain the powdery
pollen (p), the microspores, which is ultimately discharged
therefrom. The gynoecium or pistil is the central portion
of the flower, terminating the floral axis. It consists of one
or more carpels (megasporophylls), either separate (fig. 22, c)
or combined (fig. 24). The parts distinguished in the pistil
are the ovary (fig. 26, o), which is the lower portion enclosing
the ovules destined to become seeds, and the stigma (g), a portion
of loose cellular tissue, the receptive surface on which the pollen
is deposited, which is either sessile on the apex of the ovary,
as in the poppy, or is separated from it by a prolonged portion
called the style (s). The androecium and gynoecium are not
present in all flowers. When both are present the flower is
hermaphrodite; and in descriptive botany such a flower is
indicated by the symbol &#9791;. When only one of those organs
is present the flower is unisexual or diclinous, and is either male
(staminate), &#9793;; or female (pistillate), &#9792;. A flower then normally
consists of the four series of leaves&mdash;calyx, corolla, androecium
and gynoecium&mdash;and when these are all present the flower is
complete. These are usually densely crowded
upon the thalamus, but in some instances,
after apical growth has ceased in the axis,
an elongation of portions of the receptacle
by intercalary growth occurs, by which
changes in the position of the parts may be
brought about. Thus in Lychnis an elongation
of the axis betwixt the calyx and the
corolla takes place, and in this way they are
separated by an interval. Again, in the
passion-flower (Passiflora) the stamens are
separated from the corolla by an elongated
portion of the axis, which has consequently
been termed the androphore, and in Passiflora
also, fraxinella (fig. 27), Capparidaceae,
and some other plants, the ovary is
raised upon a distinct stalk termed the
gynophore; it is thus separated from the
stamens, and is said to be stipitate. Usually
the successive whorls of the flower, disposed
from below upwards or from without inwards
upon the floral axis, are of the same number of parts, or
are a multiple of the same number of parts, those of one whorl
alternating with those of the whorls next it.

In the more primitive types of flowers the torus is more or
less convex, and the series of organs follow in regular succession,
culminating in the carpels, in the formation of which the growth
of the axis is closed (fig. 28). This arrangement is known as
hypogynous, the other series (calyx, corolla and stamens) being
beneath (hypo-) the gynoecium. In other cases, the apex of the
growing point ceases to develop, and the parts below form a cup
around it, from the rim of which the outer members of the flower
are developed around (peri-) the carpels, which are formed from
the apex of the growing-point at the bottom of the cup. This
arrangement is known as perigynous (fig. 29). In many cases
this is carried farther and a cavity is formed which is roofed over
560
by the carpels, so that the outer members of the flower spring
from the edge of the receptacle which is immediately above the
ovary (epigynous), hence the term epigyny (fig. 30).

The calyx and corolla consist of

When a flower consists of parts arranged in whorls it is said
to be cyclic, and if all the whorls have an equal number of parts
and are alternate it is eucyclic (figs. 22, 23). In
contrast to the cyclic flowers are those, as in Magnoliaceae,
Symmetry of the flower.
where the parts are in spirals (acyclic). Flowers
which are cyclic at one portion and spiral at another,
as in many Ranunculaceae, are termed hemicyclic. In spiral
flowers the distinction into series is by no means easy, and usually
there is a gradual passage from sepaloid through petaloid to
staminal parts, as in the water-lily family, Nymphaeaceae (figs.
31, 32), although in some plants there is no such distinction, the
parts being all petaloid, as in Trollius. Normally, the parts of
successive whorls alternate; but in some cases we find the parts
of one whorl opposite or superposed to those of the next whorl.
In some cases, as in the vine-family Ampelidaceae, this seems
to be the ordinary mode of development, but the superposition
of the stamens on the sepals in many plants, as in the pink family,
Caryophyllaceae, is due to the suppression or abortion of the
whorl of petals, and this idea is borne out by the development,
in some plants of the order, of the suppressed whorl. As a rule,
whenever we find the parts of one whorl superposed on those of
another we may suspect some abnormality.

A flower is said to be symmetrical when each of its whorls
consists of an equal number of parts, or when the parts of any
one whorl are multiples of that preceding it. Thus, a symmetrical
flower may have five sepals, five petals, five stamens and
five carpels, or the number of any of these parts may be ten,
twenty or some multiple of five. Fig. 23 is a diagram of a
symmetrical flower, with five parts in each whorl, alternating
with each other. Fig. 33 is a diagram of a symmetrical flower
of stone-crop, with five sepals, five alternating petals, ten
stamens and five carpels. Here the number of parts in the
staminal whorl is double that in the others, and in such a case
the additional five parts form a second row alternating with
the others. In the staminal whorl especially it is common to
find additional rows. Fig. 34 shows a symmetrical flower, with
five parts in the three outer rows, and ten divisions in the inner.
In this case it is the gynoecium which has an additional number
of parts. Fig. 35 shows a flower of heath, with four divisions
of the calyx and corolla, eight stamens in two rows, and four
divisions of the pistil. In fig.
36 there are three parts in
each whorl; and in fig. 37
there are three divisions of
the calyx, corolla and pistil,
and six stamens in two rows.
In all these cases the flower
is symmetrical. In Monocotyledons
it is usual for the
staminal whorl to be double,
it rarely having more than
two rows, whilst amongst
dicotyledons there are often
very numerous rows of
stamens. The floral envelopes
are rarely multiplied. Flowers
in which the number of parts
in each whorl is the same, are
isomerous (of equal number);
when the number in some of
the whorls is different, the
flower is anisomerous (of unequal
number). The pistillate
whorl is very liable to
changes. It frequently
happens that when it is fully
formed, the number of its
parts is not in conformity
with that of the other whorls.
In such circumstances, however,
a flower has been called
symmetrical, provided the
parts of the other whorls are
normal,&mdash;the permanent state
of the pistil not being taken
into account in determining
symmetry. Thus fig. 38 shows
a pentamerous symmetrical
flower, with dimerous pistil.
Symmetry, then, in botanical
language, has reference to a
certain definite numerical
relation of parts. A flower
in which the parts are
arranged in twos is called
dimerous; when the parts of
the whorls are three, four or
five, the flower is trimerous,
tetramerous or pentamerous,
respectively. The symmetry
which is most commonly met with is trimerous and pentamerous&mdash;the
former occurring generally among monocotyledons, the
latter among dicotyledons. Dimerous and tetramerous symmetry
occur also among dicotyledons.

The various parts of the flower have a certain definite relation
to the axis. Thus, in axillary tetramerous flowers (fig. 35), one
sepal is next the axis, and is called superior or posterior; another
is next the bract, and is inferior or anterior, and the other two
are lateral; and certain terms are used to indicate that position.
A plane passing through the anterior and posterior sepal and
through the floral axis is termed the median plane of the flower;
a plane cutting it at right angles, and passing through the lateral
sepals, is the lateral plane; whilst the planes which bisect the
561
angles formed by the lateral and median planes are the diagonal
planes, and in these flowers the petals which alternate with the
sepals are cut by the diagonal planes.




Fig. 39.&mdash;Diagram of flower
of Sweet-pea (Lathyrus), showing
five sepals (s), two superior, one
inferior, and two lateral; five
petals (p), one superior, two inferior,
and two lateral; ten
stamens in two rows (a); and
one carpel (c).
Fig. 40.&mdash;Flower of Pea
(Pisum sativum), showing a papilionaceous
corolla, with one
petal superior (st) called the
standard (vexillum), two inferior
(car) called the keel (carina),
and two lateral (a) called wings
(alae). The calyx is marked c.

In a pentamerous flower one sepal may be superior, as in the
calyx of Rosaceae and Labiatae; or it may be inferior, as in
the calyx of Leguminosae (fig. 39)&mdash;the reverse, by the law of
alternation, being the case with the petals. Thus, in the blossom
of the pea (figs. 39, 40), the odd petal (vexillum) st is superior,
while the odd sepal is inferior. In the order Scrophulariaceae
one of the two carpels is posterior and the other anterior, whilst
in Convolvulaceae the carpels are arranged laterally. Sometimes
the twisting of a part makes a change in the position of other
parts, as in Orchids, where the twisting of the ovary changes
the position of the labellum.

When the different members of each whorl are like in size and
shape, the flower is said to be regular; while differences in the
size and shape of the parts of a whorl make the flower irregular,
as in the papilionaceous flower, represented in fig. 39. When a
flower can be divided by a single plane into two exactly similar
parts; then it is said to be zygomorphic. Such flowers as Papilionaceae,
Labiatae, are examples. In contrast with this are
polysymmetrical or actinomorphic flowers, which have a radial
symmetry and can be divided by several planes into several
exactly similar portions; such are all regular, symmetrical
flowers. When the parts of any whorl are not equal to or some
multiple of the others, then the flower is asymmetrical. This
want of symmetry may be brought about in various ways.
Alteration in the symmetrical arrangement as well as in the
completeness and regularity of flowers has been traced to suppression
or the non-development of parts, degeneration or imperfect
formation, cohesion or union of parts of the same whorl, adhesion
or union of the parts of different whorls, multiplication of parts,
and deduplication (sometimes called chorisis) or splitting of parts.

By suppression or non-appearance of a part at the place where
it ought to appear if the structure was normal, the symmetry
or completeness of the flower is disturbed. This suppression
when confined to the parts of certain verticils makes the flower
asymmetrical. Thus, in many Caryophyllaceae, as Polycarpon
and Holosteum, while the calyx and corolla are pentamerous,
there are only three or four stamens and three carpels; in
Impatiens Noli-me-tangere the calyx is composed of three parts,
while the other verticils have five; in labiate flowers there are
five parts of the calyx and corolla, and only four stamens; and
in Tropaeolum pentaphyllum there are five sepals, two petals,
eight stamens and three carpels. In all these cases the want of
symmetry is traced to the suppression of certain parts. In the
last-mentioned plant the normal number is five, hence it is said
that there are three petals suppressed, as shown by the position
of the two remaining ones; there are two rows of stamens,
in each of which one is wanting; and there are two carpels
suppressed. In many instances the parts which are afterwards
suppressed can be seen in the early stages of growth, and occasionally
some vestiges of them remain in the fully developed flower.
By the suppression of the verticil of the stamens, or of the
carpels, flowers become unisexual or diclinous, and by the
suppression of one or both of the floral envelopes, monochlamydeous
and achlamydeous flowers are produced. The suppression
of parts of the flower may be carried so far that at last a flower
consists of only one part of one whorl. In the Euphorbiaceae we
have an excellent example of the gradual suppression of parts,
where from an apetalous, trimerous, staminal flower we pass to
one where one of the stamens is suppressed, and then to forms
where two of them are wanting. We next have flowers in which
the calyx is suppressed, and its place occupied by one, two or
three bracts (so that the flower is, properly speaking, achlamydeous),
and only one or two stamens are produced. And finally,
we find flowers consisting of a single stamen with a bract. There
is thus traced a degradation, as it is called, from a flower with
three stamens and three divisions of the calyx, to one with a
single bract and a single stamen.

Degeneration, or the transformation of parts, often gives rise
either to an apparent want of symmetry or to irregularity in
form. In unisexual flowers it is not uncommon to find vestiges
of the undeveloped stamens in the form of filiform bodies or
scales. In double flowers transformations of the stamens and
pistils take place, so that they appear as petals. In Canna,
what are called petals are in reality metamorphosed stamens.
In the capitula of Compositae we sometimes find the florets
converted into green leaves. The limb of the calyx may appear
as a rim, as in some Umbelliferae; or as pappus, in Compositae
and Valeriana. In Scrophularia the fifth stamen appears as a
scale-like body; in other Scrophulariaceae, as in Pentstemon,
it assumes the form of a filament, with hairs at its apex in place
of an anther.

Cohesion, or the union of parts of the same whorl, and adhesion,
or the growing together of parts of different whorls, are causes
of change both as regards form and symmetry. Thus in Cucurbita
the stamens are originally five in number, but subsequently
some cohere, so that three stamens only are seen in the mature
flower. Adhesion is well seen in the gynostemium of orchids,
where the stamens and stigmas adhere. In Capparidaceae
the calyx and petals occupy their usual position, but the axis
is prolonged in the form of a gynophore, to which the stamens
are united.

Multiplication, or an increase of the number of parts, gives
rise to changes. We have already alluded to the interposition
of new members in a whorl. This takes place chiefly in the
staminal whorl, but usually the additional parts produced form
a symmetrical whorl with the others. In some instances,
however, this is not the case. Thus in the horse-chestnut there
is an interposition of two stamens, and thus seven stamens are
formed in the flower, which is asymmetrical.

Parts of the flower are often increased by a process of deduplication,
or chorisis, i.e. the splitting of a part so that two or more
parts are formed out of what was originally one. Thus in Cruciferous
plants the staminal whorl consists of four long stamens
and two short ones (tetradynamous). The symmetry in the flower
is evidently dimerous, and the abnormality in the androecium,
where the four long stamens are opposite the posterior sepals,
takes place by a splitting, at a very early stage of development,
of a single outgrowth into two. Many cases of what was considered
chorisis are in reality due to the development of stipules
from the staminal leaf. Thus in Dicentra and Corydalis there
are six stamens in two bundles; the central one of each bundle
alone is perfect, the lateral ones have each only half an anther,
and are really stipules formed from the staminal leaf. Branching
of stamens also produces apparent want of symmetry; thus,
in the so-called polyadelphous stamens of Hypericaceae there
are really only five stamens which give off numerous branches,
but the basal portion remaining short, the branches have the
appearance of separate stamens, and the flower thus seems
asymmetrical.

Cultivation has a great effect in causing changes in the various
parts of plants. Many alterations in form, size, number and
adhesion of parts are due to the art of the horticulturist. The
changes in the colour and forms of flowers thus produced are
endless. In the dahlia the florets are rendered quilled, and are
made to assume many glowing colours. In pelargonium the
flowers have been rendered larger and more showy; and such is
562
also the case with the Ranunculus, the auricula and the carnation.
Some flowers, with spurred petals in their usual state,
as columbine, are changed so that the spurs disappear; and
others, as Linaria, in which one petal only is usually spurred,
are altered so as to have all the petals spurred, and to present
what are called pelorian varieties.

As a convenient method of expressing the arrangement of the
parts of the flower, floral formulae have been devised. Several
modes of expression are employed. The following is a very
simple mode which has been proposed:&mdash;The several whorls
are represented by the letters S (sepals), P (petals), St (stamens),
C (carpels), and a figure marked after each indicates the number
of parts in that whorl. Thus the formula S5P5St5C5 means that
the flower is perfect, and has pentamerous symmetry, the whorls
being isomerous. Such a flower as that of Sedum (fig. 33) would
be represented by the formula S5P5St5+5C5, where St5+5 indicates
that the staminal whorl consists of two rows of five parts each.
A flower such as the male flower of the nettle (fig. 41) would be
expressed S4P0St4C0. When no other mark is appended the
whorls are supposed to be alternate; but if it is desired to mark
the position of the whorls special symbols are employed. Thus,
to express the superposition of one whorl upon another, a line is
drawn between them, e.g. the symbol S5P5 | St5C5 is the formula
of the flower of Primulaceae.

The manner in which the parts are arranged in the flower-bud
with respect to each other before opening is the aestivation or
praefloration. The latter terms are applied to the flower-bud
in the same way as vernation is to the leaf-bud, and distinctive
names have been given to the different arrangements exhibited,
both by the leaves individually and in their relations to each
other. As regards each leaf of the flower, it is either spread out,
as the sepals in the bud of the lime-tree, or folded upon itself
(conduplicate), as in the petals of some species of Lysimachia,
or slightly folded inwards or outwards at the edges, as in the
calyx of some species of clematis and of some herbaceous plants,
or rolled up at the edges (involute or revolute), or folded transversely,
becoming crumpled or corrugated, as in the poppy.
When the parts of a whorl are placed in an exact circle, and are
applied to each other by their edges only, without overlapping
or being folded, thus resembling the valves of a seed-vessel,
the aestivation is valvate (fig. 42). The edges of each of the parts
may be turned either inwards or outwards; in the former case
the aestivation is induplicate (fig. 43), in the latter case reduplicate
(fig. 44). When the parts of a single whorl are placed in a circle,
each of them exhibiting a torsion of its axis, so that by one of its
sides it overlaps its neighbour, whilst its side is overlapped in like
manner by that standing next to it, the aestivation is twisted
or contorted (fig. 45). This arrangement is characteristic of the
flower-buds of Malvaceae and Apocynaceae, and it is also seen
in Convolvulaceae and Caryophyllaceae. When the flower
expands, the traces of twisting often disappear, but sometimes,
as in Apocynaceae, they remain. Those forms of aestivation
are such as occur in cyclic flowers, and they are included under
circular aestivation. But in spiral flowers we have a different
arrangement; thus the leaves of the calyx of Camellia japonica
cover each other partially like tiles on a house. This aestivation
is imbricate. At other times, as in the petals of Camellia, the
parts envelop each other completely, so as to become convolute.
This is also seen in a transverse section of the calyx of Magnolia
grandiflora, where each of the three leaves embraces that within
it. When the parts of a whorl are five, as occurs in many
dicotyledons, and the imbrication is such that there are two
parts external, two internal, and a fifth which partially covers
one of the internal parts by
its margin, and is in its
turn partially covered by
one of the external parts,
the aestivation is quincuncial
(fig. 46). This quincunx
is common in the
corolla of Rosaceae. In
fig. 47 a section is given
of the bud of Antirrhinum
majus, showing the imbricate
spiral arrangement.
In this case it will be seen
that the part marked 5 has,
by a slight change in position,
become overlapped by
1. This variety of imbricate
aestivation has been
termed cochlear. In flowers
such as those of the pea
(fig. 40), one of the parts,
the vexillum, is often large
and folded over the others,
giving rise to vexillary
aestivation (fig. 48), or the
carina may perform a similar office, and then the aestivation is
carinal, as in the Judas-tree (Cercis Siliquastrum). The parts of
the several verticils often differ in their mode of aestivation.
Thus, in Malvaceae the corolla is contorted and the calyx valvate,
or reduplicate; in St John&rsquo;s-wort the calyx is imbricate, and
the corolla contorted. In Convolvulaceae, while the corolla is
twisted, and has its parts arranged in a circle, the calyx is imbricate,
and exhibits a spiral arrangement. In Guazuma the calyx
is valvate, and the corolla induplicate. The circular aestivation
is generally associated with a regular calyx and corolla, while the
spiral aestivations are connected with irregular as well as with
regular forms.

The sepals are sometimes free or separate from each other,
at other times they are united to a greater or less extent; in the
former case, the calyx is polysepalous, in the latter
gamosepalous or monosepalous. The divisions of the
Calyx.
calyx present usually the characters of leaves, and in some cases
of monstrosity they are converted into leaf-like organs, as not
infrequently happens in primulas. They are usually entire,
but occasionally they are cut in various ways, as in the rose;
they are rarely stalked. Sepals are generally of a more or less
oval, elliptical or oblong form, with their apices either blunt or
563
acute. In their direction they are erect or reflexed (with their
apices downwards), spreading outwards (divergent or patulous),
or arched inwards (connivent). They are usually of a greenish
colour (herbaceous); but sometimes they are coloured or
petaloid, as in the fuchsia, trop&#257;eolum, globe-flower and
pomegranate. Whatever be its colour, the external envelope
of the flower is considered as the calyx. The vascular bundles
sometimes form a prominent rib, which indicates the middle of
the sepal; at other times they form several ribs. The venation
is useful as pointing out the number of leaves which constitute
a gamosepalous calyx. In a polysepalous calyx the number
of the parts is indicated by Greek numerals prefixed; thus,
a calyx which has three sepals is trisepalous; one with five sepals
is pentasepalous. The sepals occasionally are of different forms
and sizes. In Aconite one of them is shaped like a helmet
(galeate). In a gamosepalous calyx the sepals are united in
various ways, sometimes very slightly, and their number is
marked by the divisions at the apex. These divisions either
are simple projections in the form of acute or obtuse teeth
(fig. 49); or they extend down the calyx as fissures about half-way,
the calyx being trifid (three-cleft), quinquefid (five-cleft), &amp;c.,
according to their number; or they reach to near the base in the
form of partitions, the calyx being tripartite, quadripartite,
quinquepartite, &amp;c. The union of the parts may be complete,
and the calyx may be quite entire or truncate, as in some Correas,
the venation being the chief indication of the different parts.
The cohesion is sometimes irregular, some parts uniting to a
greater extent than others; thus a two-lipped or labiate calyx
is formed. The upper lip is often composed of three parts,
which are thus posterior or next the axis, while the lower has
two, which are anterior. The part formed by the union of the
sepals is called the tube of the calyx; the portion where the sepals
are free is the limb.

Occasionally, certain parts of the sepals undergo marked
enlargement. In the violet the calycine segments are prolonged
downwards beyond their insertions, and in the Indian cress
(Tropaeolum) this prolongation is in the form of a spur (calcar),
formed by three sepals; in Delphinium it is formed by one.
In Pelargonium the spur from one of the sepals is adherent to
the flower-stalk. In Potentilla and allied genera an epicalyx is
formed by the development of stipules from the sepals, which
form an apparent outer calyx, the parts of which alternate with
the true sepals. In Malvaceae an epicalyx is formed by the
bracteoles. Degenerations take place in the calyx, so that it
becomes dry, scaly and glumaceous (like the glumes of grasses),
as in the rushes (Juncaceae); hairy, as in Compositae; or a
mere rim, as in some Umbelliferae and Acanthaceae, and in
Madder (Rubia tinctorum, fig. 50), when it is called obsolete or
marginate. In Compositae, Dipsacaceae and Valerianaceae
the calyx is attached to the pistil, and its limb is developed in
the form of hairs called pappus (fig. 51). This pappus is either
simple (pilose) or feathery (plumose). In Valeriana the superior
calyx is at first an obsolete rim, but as the fruit ripens it is shown
to consist of hairs rolled inwards, which expand so as to waft
the fruit. The calyx sometimes falls off before the flower
expands, as in poppies, and is caducous (fig. 52); or along with
the corolla, as in Ranunculus, and is deciduous; or it remains
after flowering (persistent) as in Labiatae, Scrophulariaceae,
and Boraginaceae; or its base only is persistent, as in Datura
Stramonium. In Eschscholtzia and Eucalyptus the sepals remain
united at the upper part, and become disarticulated at the base
or middle, so as to come off in the form of a lid or funnel. Such
a calyx is operculate or calyptrate. The existence or non-existence
of an articulation determines the deciduous or persistent nature
of the calyx.

The receptacle bearing the calyx is sometimes united to the
pistil, and enlarges so as to form a part of the fruit, as in the
apple, pear, &amp;c. In these fruits the withered calyx is seen at
the apex. Sometimes a persistent calyx increases much after
flowering, and encloses the fruit without being incorporated
with it, becoming accrescent, as in various species of Physalis
(fig. 53); at other times it remains in a withered or marcescent
form, as in Erica; sometimes it becomes inflated or vesicular,
as in sea campion (Silene maritima).

The corolla is the more or less coloured attractive inner floral
envelope; generally the most conspicuous whorl. It is present
in the greater number of Dicotyledons. Petals differ
more from ordinary leaves than sepals do, and are
Corolla.
much more nearly allied to the staminal whorl. In some cases,
however, they are transformed into leaves, like the calyx, and
occasionally leaf-buds are developed in their axil They are
seldom green, although occasionally that colour is met with, as
in some species of Cobaea, Hoya viridiflora, Gonolobus viridiflorus
and Pentatropis spiralis. As a rule they are highly coloured,
the colouring matter being contained in the cell-sap, as in blue
or red flowers, or in plastids (chromoplasts), as generally in yellow
flowers, or in both forms, as in many orange-coloured or reddish
flowers. The attractiveness of the petal is often due wholly or
in part to surface markings; thus the cuticle of the petal of a
pelargonium, when viewed with a Â½ or Â¼-in. object-glass, shows
beautiful hexagons, the boundaries of which are ornamented with
several inflected loops in the sides of the cells.

Petals are generally glabrous or smooth; but, in some
instances, hairs are produced on their surface. Petaline hairs,
though sparse and scattered, present occasionally the same
arrangement as those which occur on the leaves; thus, in
Bombaceae they are stellate. Coloured hairs are seen on the
petals of Menyanthes, and on the segments of the perianth of
Iris. They serve various purposes in the economy of the flower,
often closing the way to the honey-secreting part of the flower
to small insects, whose visits would be useless for purposes of
pollination. Although petals are usually very thin and delicate
in their texture, they occasionally become thick and fleshy,
as in Stapelia and Rafflesia; or dry, as in heaths; or hard and
stiff, as in Xylopia. A petal often consists of two portions&mdash;the
lower narrow, resembling the petiole of a leaf, and called the
unguis or claw; the upper broader, like the blade of a leaf, and
called the lamina or limb. These parts are seen in the petals
of the wallflower (fig. 54). The claw is often wanting, as in the
crowfoot (fig. 55) and the poppy, and the petals are then sessile.
According to the development of veins and the growth of cellular
tissue, petals present varieties similar to those of leaves. Thus
the margin is either entire or divided into lobes or teeth. These
teeth sometimes form a regular fringe round the margin, and the
564
petal becomes fimbriated, as in the pink; or laciniated, as in
Lychnis Flos-cuculi; or crested, as in Polygala. Sometimes the
petal becomes pinnatifid, as in Schizopetalum. The median vein
is occasionally prolonged beyond the summit of the petals in
the form of a long process, as in Strophanthus hispidus, where
it extends for 7 in.; or the prolonged extremity is folded downwards
or inflexed, as in Umbelliferae, so that the apex approaches
the base. The limb of the petal may be flat or concave, or
hollowed like a boat. In Hellebore the petals become folded
in a tubular form, resembling a horn (fig. 56); in aconite (fig. 58)
some of the petals resemble a hollow-curved horn, supported
on a grooved stalk; while in columbine, violet (fig. 57),
snapdragon and Centranthus, one or all of them are prolonged
in the form of a spur, and are calcarate. In Valeriana, Antirrhinum
and Corydalis, the spur is very short, and the corolla
or petal is said to be gibbous, or saccate, at the base. These spurs,
tubes and sacs serve as receptacles for the secretion or containing
of nectar.

A corolla is dipetalous, tripetalous, tetrapetalous or pentapetalous
according as it has two, three, four or five separate petals. The
general name of polypetalous is given to corollas having separate
petals, while monopetalous, gamopetalous or sympetalous is applied
to those in which the petals are united. This union generally
takes place at the base, and extends more or less towards the
apex; in Phyteuma the petals are united at their apices also.
In some polypetalous corollas, as that of the vine, the petals are
separate at the base and adhere by the apices. When the petals
are equal as regards their development and size, the corolla is
regular; when unequal, it is irregular. When a corolla is gamopetalous
it usually happens that the lower portion forms a
tube, while the upper parts are either free or partially united,
so as to form a common limb, the point of union of the two
portions being the throat, which often exhibits a distinct constriction
or dilatation. The number of parts forming such a corolla
can be determined by the divisions, whether existing as teeth,
crenations, fissures or partitions, or if, as rarely happens, the
corolla is entire, by the venation. The union may be equal
among the parts, or some may unite more than others.



Fig. 59.&mdash;Rosaceous
corolla (c) of the Strawberry
(Fragaria vesca),
composed of five petals
without claws.

Amongst regular polypetalous corollas may be noticed the
rosaceous corolla (fig. 59), in which there are five spreading
petals, having no claws, and arranged as in the rose, strawberry
and Potentilla; the caryophyllaceous corolla, in which there are
five petals with long, narrow, tapering claws, as in many of the
pink tribe; the cruciform, having four
petals, often unguiculate, placed opposite
in the form of a cross, as seen in wallflower,
and in other plants called cruciferous.
Of irregular polypetalous corollas
the most marked is the papilionaceous
(fig. 40), in which there are five petals:&mdash;one
superior (posterior), st, placed
next to the axis, usually larger than the
rest, called the vexillum or standard;
two lateral, a, the alae or wings; two
inferior (anterior), partially or completely
covered by the alae, and often united slightly by their
lower margins, so as to form a single keel-like piece, car, called
carina, or keel, which embraces the essential organs. This form
of corolla is characteristic of British leguminous plants.

Regular gamopetalous corollas are sometimes campanulate or
bell-shaped, as in (Campanula) (fig. 60); infundibuliform or
funnel-shaped, when the tube is like an inverted cone, and the
limb becomes more expanded at the apex, as in tobacco; hypocrateriform
or salver-shaped, when there is a straight tube surmounted
by a flat spreading limb, as in primula (fig. 61); tubular,
having a long cylindrical tube, appearing continuous with the
limb, as in Spigelia and comfrey; rotate or wheel-shaped, when
the tube is very short, and the limb flat and spreading, as in
forget-me-not, Myosotis (when the divisions of the rotate corolla
are very acute, as in Galium, it is sometimes called stellate or
star-like); urceolate or urn-shaped, when there is scarcely any
limb, and the tube is narrow at both ends, and expanded in the
middle, as in bell-heath (Erica cinerea). Some of these forms
may become irregular in consequence of certain parts being more
developed than others. Thus, in Veronica, the rotate corolla
has one division much smaller than the rest, and in foxglove
(Digitalis) there is a
slightly irregular
companulate corolla.
Of irregular
gamopetalous corollas
there may be
mentioned the labiate
or lipped (fig. 62),
having two divisions
of the limb in the
form of lips (the
upper one, u, composed
usually of two
united petals, and
the lower, l, of three),
separated by a gap.
In such cases the tube varies in length, and the parts in their
union follow the reverse order of what occurs in the calyx, where
two sepals are united in the lower lip and three in the upper.
When the upper lip of a labiate corolla is much arched, and the
lips separated by a distinct gap, it is called ringent (fig. 62). The
labiate corolla characterizes the natural order Labiatae. When
the lower lip is pressed against the upper, so as to leave only a
chink between them, the corolla is said to be personate, as in
snapdragon, and some other Scrophulariaceae. In some corollas
the two lips become hollowed out in a remarkable manner, as in
calceolaria, assuming a slipper-like appearance, similar to what
occurs in the labellum of some orchids, as Cypripedium. When a
tubular corolla is split in such a way as to form a strap-like process
on one side with several tooth-like projections at its apex, it
becomes ligulate or strap-shaped (fig. 63). This corolla occurs
in many composite plants, as in the florets of dandelion, daisy
and chicory. The number of divisions at the apex indicates the
number of united petals, some of which, however, may be
565
abortive. Occasionally some of the petals become more united
than others, and then the corolla assumes a bilabiate or two-lipped
form, as seen in the division of Compositae called Labiatiflorae.

Petals are sometimes suppressed, and sometimes the whole
corolla is absent. In Amorpha and Afzelia the corolla is reduced to
a single petal, and in some other Leguminous plants it is entirely
wanting. In the natural order Ranunculaceae, some genera, such
as Ranunculus, globe-flower and paeony, have both calyx and
corolla, while others, such as clematis, anemone and Caltha, have
only a coloured calyx. Flowers become double by the multiplication
of the parts of the corolline whorl; this arises in general
from a metamorphosis of the stamens.

the part where the tube and the labiate
limb join. From the arching of the
upper lip this corolla is called ringent.

Fig. 63.&mdash;Irregular gamopetalous
ligulate flower of Ragwort (Senecio).
It is a tubular floret, split down on one
side, with the united petals forming a
straplike projection. The lines on the
flat portion indicate the divisions of the
five petals. From the tubular portion
below, the bifid style projects slightly.

Certain structures occur on the petals of some flowers, which
received in former days the name of nectaries. The term nectary
was very vaguely applied
by Linnaeus to any part
of the flower which presented
an unusual aspect,
as the crown (corona) of
narcissus, the fringes of
the Passion-flower, &amp;c. If
the name is retained it
ought properly to include
only those parts which
secrete a honey-like substance,
as the glandular
depression at the base of
the perianth of the fritillary,
or on the petal of
Ranunculus (fig. 55), or on
the stamens of Rutaceae.
The honey secreted by
flowers attracts insects,
which, by conveying the
pollen to the stigma,
effect fertilization. The
horn-like nectaries under
the galeate sepal of
aconite (fig. 58) are modified
petals, so also are the
tubular nectaries of hellebore
(fig. 56). Other
modifications of some part
of the flower, especially
of the corolla and stamens,
are produced either by
degeneration or outgrowth,
or by chorisis,
or deduplication. Of this nature are the scales on the petals in
Lychnis, Silene and Cynoglossum, which are formed in the same
way as the ligules of grasses. In other cases, as in Samolus,
the scales are alternate with the petals, and may represent altered
stamens. In Narcissus the appendages are united to form a
crown, consisting of a membrane similar to that which unites
the stamens in Pancratium. It is sometimes difficult to say
whether these structures are to be referred to the corolline or to
the staminal row.

Petals are attached to the axis usually by a narrow base.
When this attachment takes place by an articulation, the petals
fall off either immediately after expansion (caducous) or after
fertilization (deciduous). A corolla which is continuous with the
axis and not articulated to it, as in campanula and heaths,
may be persistent, and remain in a withered or marcescent state
while the fruit is ripening. A gamopetalous corolla falls off in
one piece; but sometimes the base of the corolla remains persistent,
as in Rhinanthus and Orobanche.

The stamens and the pistil are sometimes spoken of as the
essential organs of the flower, as the presence of both is required
in order that perfect seed may be produced. As with few exceptions
the stamen represents a leaf which has been specially
developed to bear the pollen or microspores, it is spoken of in
comparative morphology as a microsporophyll; similarly the
carpels which make up the pistil are the megasporophylls (see
Angiosperms). Hermaphrodite or bisexual flowers are those
in which both these organs are found; unisexual or diclinous
are those in which only one of these organs appears,&mdash;those
bearing stamens only, being staminiferous or &ldquo;male&rdquo;; those
having the pistil only, pistilliferous or &ldquo;female.&rdquo; But even in
plants with hermaphrodite flowers self-fertilization is often provided
against by the structure of the parts or by the period of
ripening of the organs. For instance, in Primula and Linum
some flowers have long stamens and a pistil with a short style,
the others having short stamens and a pistil with a long style.
The former occur in the so-called thrum-eyed primroses (fig. 61),
the latter in the &ldquo;pin-eyed.&rdquo; Such plants are called dimorphic.
Other plants are trimorphic, as species of Lythrum, and proper
fertilization is only effected by combination of parts of equal
length. In some plants the stamens are perfected before the
pistil; these are called proterandrous, as in Ranunculus repens,
Silene maritima, Zea Mays. In other plants, but more rarely,
the pistil is perfected before the stamens, as in Potentilla argentea,
Plantago major, Coix Lachryma, and they are termed proterogynous.
Plants in which proterandry or proterogyny occurs
are called dichogamous. When in the same plant there are
unisexual flowers, both male and female, the plant is said to be
monoecious, as in the hazel and castor-oil plant. When the male
and female flowers of a species are found on separate plants,
the term dioecious is applied, as in Mercurialis and hemp; and
when a species has male, female and hermaphrodite flowers
on the same or different plants, as in Parietaria, it is polygamous.

they are so placed (fig. 64, a) upon the thalamus they are hypogynous.
Sometimes they become adherent to the petals, or are
epipetalous, and the insertion of both is looked upon as similar,
so that they are still hypogynous, provided they are independent
of the calyx and the pistil. In other cases they are perigynous
or epigynous (fig. 65). Numerous intermediate forms occur,
especially amongst Saxifragaceae, where the parts are half superior
or half inferior. Where the stamens become adherent to the
pistil so as to form a column, the flowers are said to be gynandrous,
as in Aristolochia (fig.
66). These arrangements
of parts are of
great importance in
classification. The
stamens vary in number
from one to many
hundreds. In acyclic
flowers there is often
a gradual transition
from petals to
stamens, as in the
white water-lily (fig.
31). When flowers become
double by cultivation,
the stamens
are converted into
petals, as in the
paeony, camellia,
rose, &amp;c. When there is only one whorl the stamens are
usually equal in number to the sepals or petals, and are
arranged opposite to the former, and alternate with the latter.
The flower is then isostemonous. When the stamens are not
equal in number to the sepals or petals, the flower is anisostemonous.
When there is more than one whorl of stamens, then the
parts of each successive whorl alternate with those of the whorl
preceding it. The staminal row is more liable to multiplication
of parts than the outer whorls. A flower with a single row of
stamens is haplostemonous. If the stamens are double the sepals
or petals as regards number, the flower is diplostemonous; if
more than double, polystemonous. The additional rows of
566
stamens may be developed in the usual centripetal (acropetal)
order, as in Rhamnaceae; or they may be interposed between
the pre-existing ones or be placed outside them, i.e. develop
centrifugally (basipetally), as in geranium and oxalis, when the
flower is said to be obdiplostemonous. When the stamens are
fewer than twenty they are said to be definite; when above
twenty they are indefinite, and are represented by the symbol &infin;.
The number of stamens is indicated by the Greek numerals
prefixed to the term androus; thus a flower with one stamen
is monandrous, with two, three, four, five, six or many stamens,
di-, tri-, tetr-, pent-, hex- or polyandrous, respectively.

The function of the stamen is the development and distribution
of the pollen. The stamen usually consists of two parts, a contracted
portion, often thread-like, termed the filament (fig. 25 f),
and a broader portion, usually of two lobes, termed the anther (a),
containing the powdery pollen (p), and supported upon the end
of the filament. That
portion of the filament
in contact with the
anther-lobes is termed
the connective. If the
anther is absent the
stamen is abortive,
and cannot perform
its functions. The
anther is developed
before the filament,
and when the latter is not produced, the anther is sessile, as in
the mistletoe.

The filament is usually, as its name imports, filiform or thread-like,
and cylindrical, or slightly tapering towards its summit.
It is often, however, thickened, compressed and flattened in
various ways, becoming petaloid in Canna, Marania, water-lily
(fig. 32); subulate or slightly broadened at the base and drawn
out into a point like an awl, as in Butomus umbellatus; or
clavate, that is, narrow below and broad above, as in Thalictrum.
In some instances, as in Tamarix gallica, Peganum Harmala,
and Campanula, the base of the filament is much dilated, and
ends suddenly in a narrow thread-like portion. In these cases
the base may give off lateral stipulary processes, as in Allium
and Alyssum calycinum. The filament varies much in length
and in firmness. The length sometimes bears a relation to that
of the pistil, and to the position of the flower, whether erect or
drooping. The filament is usually of sufficient solidity to support
the anther in an erect position; but sometimes, as in grasses,
and other wind-pollinated flowers, it is very delicate and hair-like,
so that the anther is pendulous (fig. 105). The filament is
generally continuous from one end to the other, but in some
cases it is bent or jointed, becoming geniculate; at other times,
as in the pellitory, it is spiral. It is colourless, or of different
colours. Thus in fuchsia and Poinciana, it is red; in Adamia
and Tradescantia virginica, blue; in Oenothera and Ranunculus
acris, yellow.

(Phragmites communis) opened
out. a, b, Barren glumes; c,

axis (rhachilla) bears long

Hairs, scales, teeth or processes of different kinds are sometimes
times developed on the filament. In spiderwort (Tradescantia
virginica) the hairs are beautifully coloured, moniliform or
necklace-like, and afford good objects for studying rotation
of the protoplasm. Filaments are usually articulated to the
thalamus or torus, and the stamens fall off after fertilization;
but in Campanula and some other plants they are continuous
with the torus, and the stamens remain persistent, although in a
withered state. Changes are produced in the whorl of stamens
by cohesion of the filaments to a greater or less extent, while
the anthers remain free; thus, all the filaments of the androecium
may unite, forming a tube
round the pistil, or a central
bundle when the pistil is abortive,
the stamens becoming
monadelphous, as occurs in
plants of the Mallow tribe; or
they may be arranged in two
bundles, the stamens being
diadelphous, as in Polygala,
Fumaria and Pea; in this case
the bundles may be equal or
unequal. It frequently happens,
especially in Papilionaceous
flowers, that out of ten stamens
nine are united by their filaments,
while one (the posterior
one) is free (fig. 68). When
there are three or more bundles
the stamens are triadelphous, as in Hypericum aegyptiacum, or
polyadelphous, as in Ricinus communis (castor-oil). In some
cases, as in papilionaceous flowers, the stamens cohere, having
been originally separate, but in most cases each bundle is produced
by the branching of a single stamen. When there are
three stamens in a bundle we may conceive the lateral ones
as of a stipulary nature. In Lauraceae there are perfect
stamens, each having at the base of the filament two abortive
stamens or staminodes, which may be analogous to stipules.
Filaments sometimes are adherent to the pistil, forming a column
(gynostemium), as in Stylidium, Asclepiadaceae, Rafflesia, and
Aristolochiaceae (fig. 66); the flowers are then termed gynandrous.

The anther consists of lobes containing the minute powdery
pollen grains, which, when mature, are discharged by a fissure
or opening of some sort. There is a double covering
of the anther&mdash;the outer, or exothecium, resembles the
The anther.
epidermis, and often presents stomata and projections of
different kinds (fig. 69); the inner, or endothecium, is formed by a
layer or layers of cellular tissue (fig. 69, cf), the cells of which
567
have a spiral, annular, or reticulated thickening of the wall.
The endothecium varies in thickness, generally becoming thinner
towards the part where the anther opens, and there disappears
entirely. The walls of the cells are frequently absorbed, so that
when the anther attains maturity the fibres are alone left, and
these by their elasticity assist in discharging the pollen. The
anther is developed before the filament, and is always sessile in
the first instance, and sometimes continues so. It appears at
first as a simple cellular papilla of meristem, upon which an
indication of two lobes soon appears. Upon these projections
the rudiments of the pollen-sacs are then seen, usually four
in number, two on each lobe. In each a differentiation takes
place in the layers beneath the epidermis, by which an outer layer
of small-celled tissue surrounds an inner portion of large cells.
Those central cells are the mother-cells of the pollen, whilst the
small-celled layer of tissue external to them becomes the endothecium,
the exothecium being formed from the epidermal layer.

In the young state there are usually four pollen-sacs, two for
each anther-lobe, and when these remain permanently complete
it is a quadrilocular or tetrathecal anther (fig. 70). Sometimes,
however, only two cavities remain in the anther, by union of
the sacs in each lobe, in which case the anther is said to be bilocular
or dithecal. Sometimes the anther has a single cavity, and
becomes unilocular, or monothecal, or dimidiate, either by the
disappearance of the partition between the two lobes, or by the
abortion of one of its lobes, as in Styphelia laeta and Althaea
officinalis (hollyhock). Occasionally there are numerous cavities
in the anther, as in Viscum and Rafflesia. The form of the
anther-lobes varies. They are generally of a more or less oval
or elliptical form, or they may be globular, as in Mercurialis
annua; at other times linear or clavate: curved, flexuose, or
sinuose, as in bryony and gourd. According to the amount of
union of the lobes and the unequal development of different
parts of their surface an infinite variety of forms is produced.
That part of the anther to which the filament is attached is the
back, the opposite being the face. The division between the lobes
is marked on the face of the anther by a groove or furrow, and
there is usually on the face a suture, indicating the line of dehiscence.
The suture is often towards one side in consequence of
the valves being unequal. The stamens may cohere by their
anthers, and become syngenesious, as in composite flowers, and in
lobelia, jasione, &amp;c.

The anther-lobes are united to the connective, which is either
continuous with the filament or articulated with it. When the
filament is continuous with the connective, and is
prolonged so that the anther-lobes appear to be united

to it throughout their whole length, and lie in apposition
to it and on both sides of it, the anther is said to be adnate or
adherent; when the filament ends at the base of the anther, then
the latter is innate or erect. In these cases the anther is to a
greater or less degree fixed. When, however, the attachment is
very narrow, and an articulation exists, the anthers are movable
(versatile) and are easily turned by the wind, as in Tritonia,
grasses (fig. 105), &amp;c., where the filament is attached only to the
middle of the connective. The connective may unite the anther-lobes
completely or only partially. It is sometimes very short
and is reduced to a mere point, so that the lobes are separate or
free. At other times it is prolonged upwards beyond the lobes,
assuming various forms, as in Acalypha and oleander; or it is
extended backwards and downwards, as in violet (fig. 71),
forming a nectar-secreting spur. In Salvia officinalis the connective
is attached to the filament in a horizontal manner, so as
to separate the two anther-lobes (fig. 72), one only of which
contains pollen, the other being imperfectly developed and sterile.
The connective is joined to the filament by a movable joint
forming a lever which plays an important part in the pollination-mechanism.
In Stachys the connective is expanded laterally,
so as to unite the bases of the anther-lobes and bring them into
a horizontal line.

The opening or dehiscence of the anthers to discharge their
contents takes place either by clefts, by valves, or by pores.
When the anther-lobes are erect, the cleft is lengthwise along the
line of the suture&mdash;longitudinal dehiscence (fig. 25). At other

times the slit is horizontal, from the connective to the
side, as in Alchemilla arvensis (fig. 73) and in Lemna;
the dehiscence is then transverse. When the anther-lobes
are rendered horizontal by the enlargement of the connective,
then what is really longitudinal dehiscence may appear
to be transverse. The cleft does not always proceed the whole
length of the anther-lobe at once,
but often for a time it extends
only partially. In other instances
the opening is confined
to the base or apex, each loculament
opening by a single pore,
as in Pyrola, Tetratheca juncea,
Rhododendron, Vaccinium and
Solanum (fig. 74), where there are
two, and Poranthera, where there
are four; whilst in the mistletoe
the anther has numerous pores
for the discharge of the pollen.
Another mode of dehiscence is
the valvular, as in the barberry
(fig. 75), where each lobe opens
by a valve on the outer side of
the suture, separately rolling up
from base to apex; in some of
the laurel tribe there are two
such valves for each lobe, or four
in all. In some Guttiferae, as
Hebradendron cambogioides (the
Ceylon gamboge plant), the
anther opens by a lid separating
from the apex (circumscissile
dehiscence).

The anthers dehisce at different
periods during the process of
flowering; sometimes in the bud,
but more commonly when the
pistil is fully developed and the
flower is expanded. They either
dehisce simultaneously or in succession.
In the latter case individual
stamens may move in
succession towards the pistil and
discharge their contents, as in
Parnassia palustris, or the outer
or the inner stamens may first
dehisce, following thus a centripetal
or centrifugal order. These
variations are intimately connected
with the arrangements
for transference of pollen. The
anthers are called introrse when
they dehisce by the surface next
to the centre of the flower; they
are extrorse when they dehisce by the outer surface; when they
dehisce by the sides, as in Iris and some grasses, they are
laterally dehiscent. Sometimes, from their versatile nature,
anthers originally introrse become extrorse, as in the Passion-flower
and Oxalis.

The usual colour of anthers is yellow, but they present a great
variety in this respect. They are red in the peach, dark purple in
the poppy and tulip, orange in Eschscholtzia, &amp;c. The colour
and appearance of the anthers often change after they have
discharged their functions.

Stamens occasionally become sterile by the degeneration or
non-development of the anthers, when they are known as
staminodia, or rudimentary stamens. In Scrophularia the fifth
stamen appears in the form of a scale; and in many Pentstemons
it is reduced to a filament with hairs or a shrivelled membrane at
the apex. In other cases, as in double flowers, the stamens are
converted into petals; this is also probably the case with such
568
plants as Mesembryanthemum, where there is a multiplication
of petals in several rows. Sometimes, as in Canna, one of the
anther-lobes becomes abortive, and a petaloid appendage is
produced. Stamens vary in length as regards the corolla.
Some are enclosed within the tube of the flower, as in Cinchona
(included); others are exserted, or extend beyond the flower,
as in Littorella or Plantago. Sometimes the stamens in the early
state of the flower project beyond the petals, and in the progress
of growth become included, as in Geranium striatum. Stamens
also vary in their relative lengths. When there is more than one
row or whorl in a flower, those on the outside are sometimes
longest, as in many Rosaceae; at other times those in the interior
are longest, as in Luhea. When the stamens are in two rows,
those opposite the petals are usually shorter than those which
alternate with the petals. It sometimes happens that a single
stamen is longer than
all the rest. A definite
relation, as regards
number, sometimes
exists between the long
and the short stamens.
Thus, in some flowers
the stamens are didynamous,
having only
four out of five stamens
developed, and the
two corresponding to
the upper part of the
flower longer than the
two lateral ones. This
occurs in Labiatae and
Scrophulariaceae (fig.
76). Again, in other
cases there are six
stamens, whereof four
long ones are arranged
in pairs opposite to each
other, and alternate
with two isolated short ones (fig. 77), giving rise to tetradynamous
flowers, as in Cruciferae. Stamens, as regards their direction,
may be erect, turned inwards, outwards, or to one side. In the
last-mentioned case they are called declinate, as in amaryllis,
horse-chestnut and fraxinella.

The pollen-grains or microspores contained in the anther consist
of small cells, which are developed in the large thick-walled
mother-cells formed in the interior of the pollen-sacs (microsporangia)
of the young anther. These mother-cells are either
separated from one another and float in the granular fluid which
fills up the cavity of the pollen-sac, or are not so isolated. A
division takes place, by which four cells are formed in each, the
exact mode of division differing in dicotyledons and monocotyledons.
These cells are the pollen-grains. They increase
in size and acquire a cell-wall, which becomes differentiated into
an outer cuticular layer, or extine, and an inner layer, or intine.
Then the walls of the mother-cells are absorbed, and the pollen-grains
float freely in the fluid of the pollen-sacs, which gradually
disappears, and the mature grains form a powdery mass within
the anther. They then either remain united in fours, or multiples
of four, as in some acacias, Periploca graeca and Inga anomala,
or separate into individual grains, which by degrees become
mature pollen. Occasionally the membrane of the mother-cell is
not completely absorbed, and traces of it are detected in a
viscid matter surrounding the pollen-grains, as in Onagraceae.
In orchidaceous plants the pollen-grains are united into masses,
or pollinia (fig. 78), by means of viscid matter. In orchids each
of the pollen-masses has a prolongation or stalk (caudicle) which
adheres to a prolongation at the base of the anther (rostellum)
by means of a viscid gland (retinaculum) which is either naked
or covered. The term clinandrium is sometimes applied to the
part of the column in orchids where the stamens are situated.
In some orchids, as Cypripedium, the pollen has its ordinary
character of separate grains. The number of pollinia varies;
thus, in Orchis there are usually two, in Cattleya four, and in
Laelia eight. The two pollinia in Orchis Morio contain each
about 200 secondary smaller masses. These small masses, when
bruised, divide into grains which are united in fours. In Asclepiadaceae
the pollinia are usually united in pairs (fig. 79), belonging
to two contiguous anther-lobes&mdash;each pollen-mass having a
caudicular appendage, ending in a common gland, by means of
which they are attached to a process of the stigma. The pollinia
are also provided with an appendicular staminal covering (fig. 80).
The exine is a firm membrane, which
defines the figure of the pollen-grain, and
gives colour to it. It is either smooth, or
covered with numerous projections (fig. 81),
granules, points or crested reticulations.
The colour is generally yellow, and the surface
is often covered with a viscid or oily
matter. The intine is uniform in different
kinds of pollen, thin and transparent,
and possesses great power of extension.
In some aquatics, as Zostera, Zannichellia, Naias, &amp;c., only one
covering exists.

Pollen-grains vary from 1&frasl;300 to 1&frasl;700 of an inch or less in diameter.
Their forms are various. The most common form of grain is
ellipsoidal, more or less narrow at the extremities, which are
called its poles, in contradistinction to a line equidistant from
the extremities, which is its equator. Pollen-grains are also
spherical; cylindrical and curved, as in Tradescantia virginica;
polyhedral in Dipsacaceae and Compositae; nearly triangular in
section in Proteaceae and Onagraceae (fig. 82). The surface of the
pollen-grain is either uniform and homogeneous, or it is marked
by folds formed by thinnings of the membrane. There are also
rounded portions of the membrane or pores visible in the pollen-grain;
these vary in number from one to fifty, and through one
569
or more of them the pollen-tube is extended in germination of
the spore. In Monocotyledons, as in grasses, there is often only
one, while in Dicotyledons they number from three upwards;
when numerous, the pores are either scattered irregularly, or
in a regular order, frequently forming a circle round the equatorial
surface. Sometimes at the place where they exist, the outer
membrane, in place of being thin and transparent, is separated
in the form of a lid, thus becoming operculate, as in the passion-flower
and gourd. Within the pollen-grain is the granular
protoplasm with some oily particles, and occasionally starch.
Before leaving the pollen-sac a division takes place in the pollen-grain
into a vegetative cell or cells, from which the tube is
developed, and a generative cell, which ultimately divides to
form the male cells (see Angiosperms and Gymnosperms).

When the pollen-grains are ripe, the anther dehisces and the
pollen is shed. In order that fertilization may be effected the
pollen must be conveyed to the stigma of the pistil.
This process, termed pollination (see Pollination),

is promoted in various ways,&mdash;the whole form and
structure of the flower having relation to the process. In some
plants, as Kalmia and Pellitory (fig. 83), the mere elasticity
of the filaments is sufficient to effect this; in other plants
pollination is effected by the wind, as in most of our forest trees,
grasses, &amp;c., and in such cases enormous quantities of pollen are
produced. These plants are anemophilous. But the common
agents for pollination are insects. To allure and attract them
to visit the flower the odoriferous secretions and gay colours
are developed, and the position and complicated structure of
the parts of the flower are adapted to the perfect performance
of the process. It is comparatively rare in hermaphrodite flowers
for self-fertilization to occur, and the various forms of dichogamy,
dimorphism and trimorphism are fitted to prevent this.

glands, hairs, petaloid appendages, &amp;c., and in the progress of
growth it often contains saccharine matter, thus becoming truly
nectariferous. The disk is frequently formed by degeneration
or transformation of the staminal row. It may consist of
processes rising from the torus, alternating with the stamens,
and thus representing an abortive whorl; or its parts may be
opposite to the stamens. In some
flowers, as Jatropha Curcas, in which
the stamens are not developed, their
place is occupied by glandular
bodies forming the disk. In Gesneraceae
and Cruciferae the disk consists
of tooth-like scales at the base
of the stamens. The parts composing
the disk sometimes unite and
form a glandular ring, as in the
orange; or they form a dark-red
lamina covering the pistil, as in
Paeonia Moutan (fig. 84); or a
waxy lining of the hollow receptacle,
as in the rose; or a swelling at the
top of the ovary, as in Umbelliferae,
in which the disk is said to be
epigynous. The enlarged torus
covering the ovary in Nymphaea
(Castalia) and Nelumbium may be regarded as a form of disk.

The pistil or gynoecium occupies the centre or apex of the
flower, and is surrounded by the stamens and floral envelopes
when these are present. It constitutes the innermost
whorl, which after flowering is changed into the fruit

and contains the seeds. It consists essentially of two parts, a
basal portion forming a chamber, the ovary, containing the ovules
attached to a part called the placenta, and an upper receptive
portion, the stigma, which is either seated on the ovary (sessile),
as in the tulip and poppy, or is elevated on a stalk called the
style, interposed between the ovary and stigma. The pistil
consists of one or more modified leaves, the carpels (or megasporophylls).
When a pistil consists of a single carpel it is simple or
monocarpellary (fig. 85). When it is composed of several carpels,
more or less united, it is compound or polycarpellary (fig. 86).
In the first-mentioned case the terms carpel and pistil are
synonymous. Each carpel has its own ovary, style (when
present), and stigma, and may be regarded as formed by a folded
leaf, the upper surface of which is turned inwards towards the
axis, and the lower outwards, while from its margins are developed
one or more ovules. This comparison is borne out by an examination
of the flower of the double-flowering cherry. In it no fruit
is produced, and the pistil consists merely of sessile leaves,
the limb of each being green and folded, with a narrow prolongation
upwards, as if from the midrib, and ending in a thickened
portion. In Cycas the carpels are ordinary leaves, with ovules
upon their margin.

Fig. 90.&mdash;Syncarpous Pistil of Flax (Linum), consisting of five
carpels, united by their ovaries, while their styles and stigmas are

A pistil is usually formed by more than one carpel. The carpels
may be arranged either at the same or nearly the same height
in a verticil, or at different heights in a spiral cycle. When they
remain separate and distinct, thus showing at once the composition
of the pistil, as in Caltha, Ranunculus, hellebore (fig. 86), and
Spiraea, the term apocarpous is applied. Thus, in Sedum (fig. 22)
the pistil consists of five verticillate carpels o, alternating with
the stamens e. In magnolia and Ranunculus (fig. 89) the separate
carpels are numerous and are arranged in a spiral cycle upon an
elongated axis or receptacle. In the raspberry the carpels are
on a conical receptacle; in the strawberry, on a swollen succulent
one (fig. 87); and in the rose (fig. 88), on a hollow one. When
the carpels are united, as in the pear, arbutus and chickweed,
the pistil becomes syncarpous. The number of carpels in a pistil
is indicated by the Greek numeral. A flower with a simple
pistil is monogynous; with two carpels, digynous; with three
carpels, trigynous, &amp;c.

The union in a syncarpous pistil is not always complete;
it may take place by the ovaries alone, while the styles and
stigmas remain free (fig. 90), and in this case, when the ovaries
form apparently a single body, the organ receives the name of
compound ovary; or the union may take place by the ovaries
and styles while the stigmas are disunited; or by the stigmas
570
and the summit of the style only. Various intermediate states
exist, such as partial union of the ovaries, as in the rue, where
they coalesce at their base; and partial union of the styles, as
in Malvaceae. The union is usually most complete at the base;
but in Labiatae the styles are united throughout their length, and
in Apocynaceae and Asclepiadaceae the stigmas only. When
the union is incomplete, the number of the parts of a compound
pistil may be determined by the number of styles and
stigmas; when complete, the external venation, the grooves
on the surface, and the internal divisions of the ovary indicate
the number.

The ovules are attached to the placenta, which consists of a
mass of cellular tissue, through which the nourishing vessels
pass to the ovule. The placenta is usually formed on
the edges of the carpellary leaf (fig. 91)&mdash;marginal.
The placenta.
In many cases, however, the placentas are formations
from the axis (axile), and are not connected with the carpellary
leaves. In marginal placentation the part of the carpel bearing
the placenta is the inner or ventral
suture, corresponding to the margin
of the folded carpellary leaf, while
the outer or dorsal suture corresponds
to the midrib of the carpellary leaf.
As the placenta is formed on each
margin of the carpel it is essentially
double. This is seen in cases where
the margins of the carpel do not
unite, but remain separate, and consequently
two placentas are formed in
place of one. When the pistil is
formed by one carpel the inner margins
unite and form usually a common
marginal placenta, which may extend
along the whole margin of the ovary
as far as the base of the style (fig. 91),
or may be confined to the base or
apex only. When the pistil consists
of several separate carpels, or is
apocarpous, there are generally separate
placentas at each of their margins. In a syncarpous pistil,
on the other hand, the carpels are so united that the edges of
each of the contiguous ones, by their union, form a septum or
dissepiment, and the number of these septa consequently indicates
the number of carpels in the compound pistil (fig. 92). When the
dissepiments extend to the centre or axis, the ovary is divided
into cavities or cells, and it may be bilocular, triloculur (fig. 92),
quadrilocular, quinquelocular, or multilocular, according as it is
formed by two, three, four, five or many carpels, each carpel
corresponding to a single cell. In these cases the marginal
placentas meet in the axis, and unite so as to form a single central
one (figs. 92, 93), and the ovules appear in the central angle of
the loculi. When the carpels in a syncarpous pistil do not fold
inwards so that the placentas appear as projections on the walls
of the ovary, then the ovary is unilocular (fig. 95) and the
placentas are parietal, as in Viola (fig. 96). In these instances
the placentas may be formed at the margin of the united contiguous
leaves, so as to appear single, or the margins may not be
united, each developing a placenta. Frequently the margins of
the carpels, which fold in to the centre, split there into two
lamellae, each of which is curved outwards and projects into the
loculament, dilating at the end into a placenta. This is well
seen in Cucurbitaceae (fig. 97), Pyrola, &amp;c. The carpellary leaves
may fold inwards very slightly, or they may be applied in a
valvate manner, merely touching at their margins, the placentas
then being parietal (fig. 94), and appearing as lines or thickenings
along the walls. Cases occur, however, in which the placentas
are not connected with the
walls of the ovary, and form
what is called a free central
placenta (fig. 98). This is seen
in many of the Caryophyllaceae
and Primulaceae (figs.
99, 100). In Caryophyllaceae,
however, while the placenta
is free in the centre, there are
often traces found at the base
of the ovary of the remains of
septa, as if rupture had taken
place, and, in rare instances,
ovules are found on the
margins of the carpels. But
in Primulaceae no vestiges of
septa or marginal ovules can
be perceived at any period of
growth; the placenta is
always free, and rises in the
centre of the ovary. Free
central placentation, therefore,
has been accounted for in two ways: either by supposing
that the placentas in the early state were formed on the margins of
571
carpellary leaves, and that in the progress of development these
leaves separated from them, leaving the placentas and ovules
free in the centre; or by supposing that the placentas are not
marginal but axile formations, produced by an elongation of the
axis, and the carpels verticillate leaves, united together around
the axis. The first of these views applies to Caryophyllaceae,
the second to Primulaceae.

Occasionally, divisions take place in ovaries which are not
formed by the edges of contiguous carpels. These are called
spurious dissepiments. They are often horizontal, as in Cathartocarpus
Fistula, where they consist of transverse cellular prolongations
from the walls of the ovary, only developed after
fertilization, and therefore more properly noticed under fruit.
At other times they are vertical, as in Datura, where the ovary,
in place of being two-celled, becomes four-celled; in Cruciferae,
where the prolongation of the placentas forms a vertical partition;
in Astragalus and Thespesia, where the dorsal suture is folded
inwards; and in Oxytropis, where the ventral suture is folded
inwards.

The ovary is usually of a more or less spherical or curved form,
sometimes smooth and uniform on its surface, at other times
hairy and grooved. The grooves usually indicate the divisions
between the carpels and correspond to the dissepiments. The
dorsal suture may be marked by a slight projection or by a
superficial groove. When the ovary is situated on the centre
of the receptacle, free from the other whorls, so that its base is
above the insertion of the stamens, it is termed superior, as in
Lychnis, Primula (fig. 61) and Peony (fig. 64) (see also fig. 28).
When the margin of the receptacle is prolonged upwards, carrying
with it the floral envelopes and staminal leaves, the basal portion
of the ovary being formed by the receptacle, and the carpellary
leaves alone closing in the apex, the ovary is inferior, as in
pomegranate, aralia (fig. 65), gooseberry and fuchsia (see
fig. 30). In some plants,
as many Saxifragaceae,
there are intermediate
forms, in which the term
half-inferior is applied to
the ovary, whilst the
floral whorls are half-superior.

The style proceeds
from the summit of the
carpel (fig.
102), and is
traversed by a narrow
canal, in which there are
some loose projecting
cells, a continuation of
the placenta, constituting
what is called conducting
tissue, which ends in
the stigma. This is particularly
abundant when

the pistil is ready for
fertilization. In some
cases, owing to more
rapid growth of the
dorsal side of the ovary,
the style becomes lateral
(fig. 101); this may so
increase that the style
appears to arise from
near the base, as in the
strawberry, or from the base, as in Chrysobalanus Icaco, when
it is called basilar. In all these cases the style still indicates
the organic apex of the ovary, although it may not be the
apparent apex. When in a compound pistil the style of each
carpel is thus displaced, it appears as if the ovary were
depressed in the centre, and the style rising from the depression
in the midst of the carpels seems to come from the torus.
Such a style is gynobasic, and is well seen in Boraginaceae.
The form of the style is usually cylindrical, more or less filiform
and simple; sometimes it is grooved on one side, at other times
it is flat, thick, angular, compressed and even petaloid, as in Iris
(fig. 103) and Canna. In Goodeniaceae it ends in a cuplike
expansion, enclosing the stigma. It sometimes bears hairs,
which aid in the application of the pollen to the stigma, and are
called collecting hairs, as in Campanula, and also in Aster and other
Compositae. These hairs, during the upward growth of the
style, come into contact with the already ripened pollen, and
carry it up along with them, ready to be applied by insects to the
mature stigma of other flowers. In Vicia and Lobelia the hairs
frequently form a tuft below the stigma. The styles of a syncarpous
pistil are either separate or united; when separate, they
alternate with the septa; when united completely, the style is
said to be simple (fig. 102). The style of a single carpel, or of
each carpel of a compound pistil, may also be divided. Each
division of the tricarpellary ovary of Jatropha Curcas has a
bifurcate or forked style, and the ovary of Emblica officinalis has
three styles, each of which is twice forked. The length of the
style is determined by the relation which should subsist between
the position of the stigma and that of the anthers, so as to allow
the proper application of the pollen. The style is deciduous or
persists after fertilization.

The stigma is the termination of the conducting tissue of the
style, and is usually in direct communication with the placenta.
It consists of loose cellular tissue, and secretes a viscid
matter which detains the pollen, and causes it to

germinate. This secreting portion is, strictly speaking,
the true stigma, but the name is generally applied to all the
divisions of the style on which the stigmatic apparatus is situated.
The stigma alternates with the dissepiments of a syncarpous
pistil, or, in other words, corresponds with the back of the
loculaments; but in some cases it would appear that half the
stigma of one carpel unites with half that of the contiguous
carpel, and thus the stigma is opposite the dissepiments, that is,
alternates with the loculaments, as in the poppy.

The divisions of the stigma mark the number of carpels which
compose the pistil. Thus in Campanula a five-cleft stigma
indicates five carpels; in Bignoniaceae, Scrophulariaceae and
Acanthaceae, the two-lobed or bilamellar stigma indicates a
bilocular ovary. Sometimes, however, as in Gramineae, the
stigma of a single carpel divides. Its position may be terminal
or lateral. In Iris it is situated on a cleft on the back of the
petaloid divisions of the style (fig. 103). Some stigmas, as
those of Mimulus, present sensitive flattened laminae, which
close when touched. The stigma presents various forms. It may
be globular, as in Mirabilis Jalapa; orbicular, as in Arbutus
Andrachne; umbrella-like, as in
Sarracenia, where, however, the
proper stigmatic surface is beneath
the angles of the large expansion
of the apex of the style; ovoid, as
in fuchsia; hemispherical; polyhedral;
radiating, as in the poppy
(fig. 104), where the true stigmatic
rays are attached to a sort of peltate
or shield-like body, which may
represent depressed or flattened
styles; cucullate, i.e. covered by a
hood, in calabar bean. The lobes
of a stigma are flat and pointed as
in Mimulus and Bignonia, fleshy
and blunt, smooth or granular, or
they are feathery, as in many
grasses (fig. 105) and other wind-pollinated
flowers. In Orchidaceae
the stigma is situated on the anterior surface of the column
beneath the anther. In Asclepiadaceae the stigmas are
united to the face of the anthers, and along with them form
a solid mass.

The ovule is attached to the placenta, and destined to become
the seed. Ovules are most usually produced on the margins of
572
the carpellary leaves, but are also formed over the whole
surface of the leaf, as in Butomus. In other instances they rise

from the floral axis itself, either terminal, as in Polygonaceae
and Piperaceae, or lateral, as in Primulaceae
and Compositae. The ovule is usually contained in an ovary,
and all plants in which the ovule is so enclosed are termed
angiospermous; but in Coniferae and Cycadaceae it has no
proper ovarian covering, and is called naked, these orders being
denominated gymnospermous. In Cycas the altered leaf, upon
the margin of which the ovule is produced, and the peltate scales,
from which they are pendulous in Zamia, are regarded by all
botanists as carpellary leaves. As for the Coniferae great discussion
has arisen regarding the morphology of parts in many
genera. The carpellary leaves are sometimes united in such a
way as to leave an opening at the apex of the pistil, so that the
ovules are exposed, as in mignonette. In Leontice thalictroides
(Blue Cohosh), species of Ophiopogon, Peliosanthes and Stateria,
the ovary ruptures immediately after flowering, and the ovules
are exposed; and in species of Cuphea the placenta ultimately
bursts through the ovary and corolla, and becomes erect, bearing
the exposed ovules. The ovule is attached to the placenta either
directly, when it is sessile, or by means of a prolongation funicle
(fig. 110, f). This cord sometimes becomes much elongated after
fertilization. The part by which the ovule is attached to the
placenta or cord is its base or hilum, the opposite extremity being
its apex. The latter is frequently turned round in such a way
as to approach the base. The ovule is sometimes embedded in
the placenta, as in Hydnora.

(Pinus austriaca), showing the nucellus a, consisting of delicate

The micropyle m is very wide.

The ovule appears at first as a small cellular projection from
the placenta. The cells multiply until they assume a more or
less enlarged ovate form constituting what has been called the
nucellus (fig. 106, n), or central cellular mass of the ovule. This
nucellus may remain naked, and alone form the ovule, as in
some orders of parasitic plants such as Balanophoraceae, Santalaceae,
&amp;c.; but in most plants it becomes surrounded by certain
coverings or integuments during its development. These appear
first in the form of cellular rings at the base of the nucellus,
which gradually spread over its surface (figs. 106, 107). In some
cases only one covering is formed, especially amongst gamopetalous
dicotyledons, as in Compositae, Campanulaceae, also
in walnut, &amp;c. But usually besides the single covering another
is developed subsequently (fig. 106, o), which gradually extends
over that first formed, and ultimately covers it completely,
except at the apex. There are thus two integuments to the
nucellus, an outer and an inner. The integuments do not
completely invest the apex of the nucellus, but an opening termed
the micropyle is left. The micropyle indicates the organic apex
of the ovule. A single cell of the nucellus enlarges greatly to
form the embryo-sac or megaspore (fig. 108, s). This embryo-sac
increases in size, gradually supplanting the cellular tissue of the
nucellus until it is surrounded only by a thin layer of it; or it
may actually extend at the apex beyond it, as in Phaseolus
and Alsine media; or it may pass into the micropyle, as in
Santalum. In Gymnosperms it usually remains deep in the
nucellus and surrounded by a thick mass of cellular tissue (fig.
109). For an account of the further development of the megaspore,
and the formation of the egg-cell, from which after fertilization
is formed the embryo, see Gymnosperms and Angiosperms.

from the base or hilum h, while
the micropyle f is near the base. The
connexion between the base of the ovule
and the base of the nucellus is kept up
by means of the raphe r.

The point where the integuments are united to the base of
the nucellus is called the chalaza (figs. 111, 112). This is often
coloured, is of a denser
texture than the surrounding
tissue, and is
traversed by fibro-vascular
bundles, which
pass from the placenta
to nourish the ovule.

When the ovule is
so developed that the
chalaza is at the
hilum (next the placenta),
and the micropyle
is at the opposite
extremity, there being
a short funicle, the
ovule is orthotropous.
This form is well seen in
Polygonaceae (fig. 112),
Cistaceae, and most
gymnosperms. In such
an ovule a straight line
drawn from the hilum
to the micropyle passes
along the axis of the
ovule. Where, by more rapid growth on one side than on the
other, the nucellus, together with the integuments, is curved upon
itself, so that the micropyle approaches the hilum, and ultimately
is placed close to it, while the chalaza is at the hilum, the ovule is
campylotropous (fig. 110). Curved ovules are found in Cruciferae,
and Caryophyllaceae. The inverted or anatropous ovule (fig. 111)
is the commonest form amongst angiosperms. In this ovule the
apex with the micropyle is turned towards the point of attachment
of the funicle to the placenta, the chalaza being situated
at the opposite extremity; and the funicle, which runs along the
side usually next the placenta, coalesces with the ovule and
constitutes the raphe (r), which often forms a ridge. The
anatropous ovule arises from the placenta as a straight or only
slightly curved cellular process, and as it grows, gradually
becomes inverted, curving from the point of origin of the integuments
(cf. figs. 106, 107). As the first integument grows round
it, the amount of inversion increases, and the funicle becomes
adherent to the side of the nucellus. Then if a second integument
be formed it covers all the free part of the ovule, but does not
form on the side to which the raphe is adherent. These may be
taken as the three types of ovule; but there are various intermediate
forms, such as semi-anatropous and others.

The position of the ovule relative to the ovary varies. When
there is a single ovule, with its axis vertical, it may be attached
to the placenta at the base of the ovary (basal placenta), and is
then erect, as in Polygonaceae and Compositae; or it may be
inserted a little above the base, on a parietal placenta, with its
apex upwards, and then is ascending, as in Parietaria. It may
hang from an apicilar placenta at the summit of the ovary, its
apex being directed downwards, and is inverted or pendulous,
as in Hippuris vulgaris; or from a parietal placenta near the
summit, and then is suspended, as in Daphne Mezereum, Polygalaceae
and Euphorbiaceae. Sometimes a long funicle arises
from a basal placenta, reaches the summit of the ovary, and
there bending over suspends the ovule, as in Armeria (sea-pink);
at other times the hilum appears to be in the middle, and the
ovule becomes horizontal. When there are two ovules in the
same cell, they may be either collateral, that is, placed side by
573
side (fig. 92), or the one may be erect and the other inverted,
as in some species of Spiraea and Aesculus; or they may be
placed one above another, each directed similarly, as is the case
in ovaries containing a moderate or definite number of ovules.
Thus, in the ovary of Leguminous plants (fig. 91), the ovules, o,
are attached to the extended marginal placenta, one above the
other, forming usually two parallel rows corresponding to each
margin of the carpel. When the ovules are definite (i.e. are
uniform, and can be counted), it is usual to find their attachment
so constant as to afford good characters for classification. When
the ovules are very numerous (indefinite), while at the same time
the placenta is not much developed, their position exhibits great
variation, some being directed upwards, others downwards,
others transversely; and their form is altered by pressure into
various polyhedral shapes. In such cases it frequently happens
that some of the ovules are arrested in their development and
become abortive.

it is detained there, and the viscid secretion from the
glands of the stigma in the former case, or from the nucellus in
the latter, induce the protrusion of the intine as a pollen-tube
through the pores of the grain.
The pollen-tube or tubes pass
down the canal (fig. 112),
through the conducting tissue
of the style when present, and
reach the interior of the ovary
in angiosperms, and then pass
to the micropyle of the ovule,
one pollen-tube going to each
ovule. Sometimes the micropyle
lies close to the base of
the style, and then the pollen-tube
enters it at once, but
frequently it has to pass some
distance into the ovary, being
guided in its direction by various
contrivances, as hairs,
grooves, &amp;c. In gymnosperms
the pollen-grain resting on the
apex of the nucellus sends out
its pollen-tubes, which at once
penetrate the nucellus (fig. 113).
In angiosperms when the pollen-tube
reaches the micropyle it
passes down into the canal, and this portion of it increases
considerably in size. Ultimately the apex of the tube comes in
contact with the tip of the embryo-sac and perforates it. The
male cells in the end of the pollen-tube are then transmitted to
the embryo-sac and fertilization is effected. Consequent upon
this, after a longer or shorter period, those changes commence
in the embryo-sac which result in the formation of the embryo
plant, the ovule also undergoing changes which convert it into
the seed, and fit it for a protective covering, and a store of
nutriment for the embryo. Nor are the effects of fertilization
confined to the ovule; they extend to other parts of the plant.
The ovary enlarges, and, with the seeds enclosed, constitutes
the fruit, frequently incorporated with which are other parts
of the flower, as receptacle, calyx, &amp;c. In gymnosperms the
pollen-tubes, having penetrated a certain distance down the
tissue of the nucellus, are usually arrested in growth for a longer
or shorter period, sometimes nearly a year. Fruit and seed are
discussed in a separate article&mdash;Fruit.

FLOWERS, ARTIFICIAL. Imitations of natural flowers are
sometimes made for scientific purposes (as the collection of glass
flowers at Harvard University, which illustrates the flora of the
United States), but more often as articles of decoration and
ornament. A large variety of materials have been used in their
manufacture by different peoples at different times&mdash;painted
linen and shavings of stained horn by the Egyptians, gold and
silver by the Romans, rice-paper by the Chinese, silkworm
cocoons in Italy, the plumage of highly coloured birds in South
America, wax, small tinted shells, &amp;c. At the beginning of the
18th century the French, who originally learnt the art from the
Italians, made great advances in the accuracy of their reproductions,
and towards the end of that century the Paris manufacturers
enjoyed a world-wide reputation. About the same
time the art was introduced into England by French refugees,
and soon afterwards it spread also to America. The industry
is now a highly specialized one and comprises a large number of
operations performed by separate hands. Four main processes
may be distinguished. The first consists of cutting up the various
fabrics and materials employed into shapes suitable for forming
the leaves, petals, &amp;c.; this may be done by scissors, but more
often stamps are employed which will cut through a dozen or
more thicknesses at one blow. The veins of the leaves are next
impressed by means of a die, and the petals are given their
natural rounded forms by goffering irons of various shapes.
The next step is to assemble the petals and other parts of the
flower, which is built up from the centre outwards; and the
fourth is to mount the flower on a stalk formed of brass or iron
wire wrapped round with suitably coloured material, and to
fasten on the leaves required to complete the spray.



FLOYD, JOHN (1572-1649), English Jesuit, was born in
Cambridgeshire in 1572. He entered the Society of Jesus when
at Rome in 1592 and is also known as Daniel Ã  Jesu, Hermannus
Loemelius, and George White, the names under which he published
a score of controversial treatises. He had considerable
fame both as a preacher and teacher, and was frequently arrested
in England. His last years were spent at Louvain and he died
at St Omer on the 15th of September 1649. His brother Edward
Floyd was impeached and sentenced by the Commons in 1621 for
speaking disparagingly of the elector palatine.



FLOYD, JOHN BUCHANAN (1807-1863), American politician,
was born at Blacksburg, Virginia, on the 1st of June 1807. He
was the son of John Floyd (1770-1837), a representative in
Congress from 1817 to 1829 and governor of Virginia from
1830 to 1834. After graduating at South Carolina College in 1826,
the son practised law in his native state and at Helena, Arkansas,
and in 1839 settled in Washington county, Virginia, which in
1847-1849 and again in 1853 he represented in the state legislature.
Meanwhile, from 1849 to 1852, he was governor of Virginia,
in which position he recommended to the legislature the enactment
of a law laying an import tax on the products of such states
as refused to surrender fugitive slaves owned by Virginia masters.
In March 1857 he became secretary of war in President
Buchanan&rsquo;s cabinet, where his lack of administrative ability
was soon apparent. In December 1860, on ascertaining that
Floyd had honoured heavy drafts made by government contractors
in anticipation of their earnings, the president requested
his resignation. Several days later Floyd was indicted for
malversation in office, but the indictment was overruled on
technical grounds. There is no proof that he profited by
these irregular transactions; in fact he went out of the office
574
financially embarrassed. Though he had openly opposed secession
before the election of Lincoln, his conduct after that event,
especially after his breach with Buchanan, fell under suspicion,
and he was accused of having sent large stores of government
arms to Southern arsenals in anticipation of the Civil War. In
the last days of his term he apparently had such an intention,
but during the year 1860 the Southern States actually received
less than their full quota of arms. After the secession of Virginia
he was commissioned a brigadier-general in the Confederate
service. He was first employed in some unsuccessful operations
in western Virginia, and in February 1862 became commander
of the Confederate forces at Fort Donelson, from which he fled
with his second in command, General Gideon J. Pillow, on the
night of February 18, leaving General Simon B. Buckner to
surrender to General Grant. A fortnight later President Davis
relieved him of his command. He died at Abingdon, Virginia,
on the 26th of August 1863.



FLOYER, SIR JOHN (1649-1734), English physician and
author, was born at Hinters in Staffordshire, and was educated
at Oxford. He practised in Lichfield, and it was by his advice
that Dr Johnson, when a child, was taken by his mother to be
touched by Queen Anne for the king&rsquo;s evil on the 30th of March
1714. He died on the 1st of February 1734. Floyer was an
advocate of cold bathing, introduced the practice of counting the
rate of the pulse-beats, and gave an early account of the pathological
changes in the lungs associated with emphysema.


His writings include:&mdash;&#934;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#954;&#959;-&#914;&#940;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;: or the Touchstone of

FLUDD, or Flud, ROBERT [Robertus de Fluctibus] (1574-1637),
English physician and mystical philosopher, the son of
Sir Thomas Fludd, treasurer of war to Queen Elizabeth in France
and the Low Countries, was born at Milgate, Kent. After
studying at St John&rsquo;s College, Oxford, he travelled in Europe
for six years, and became acquainted with the writings of
Paracelsus. He subsequently returned to Oxford, became a
member of Christ Church, took his medical degrees, and ultimately
became a fellow of the College of Physicians. He practised
in London with success, though it is said that he combined with
purely medical treatment a good deal of faith-healing. Following
Paracelsus, he endeavoured to form a system of philosophy
founded on the identity of physical and spiritual truth. The
universe and all created things proceed from God, who is the
beginning, the end and the sum of all things, and to him they
will return. The act of creation is the separation of the active
principle (light) from the passive (darkness) in the bosom of the
divine unity (God). The universe consists of three worlds;
the archetypal (God), the macrocosm (the world), the microcosm
(man). Man is the world in miniature, all the parts of both
sympathetically correspond and act upon each other. It is
possible for man (and even for the mineral and the plant)
to undergo transformation and to win immortality. Fludd&rsquo;s
system may be described as a materialistic pantheism, which,
allegorically interpreted, he put forward as containing the real
meaning of Christianity, revealed to Adam by God himself,
handed down by tradition to Moses and the patriarchs, and revealed
a second time by Christ. The opinions of Fludd had the
honour of being refuted by Kepler, Gassendi and Mersenne.
Though rapt in mystical speculation, Fludd was a man of varied
attainments. He did not disdain scientific experiments, and is
thought by some to be the original inventor of the barometer.
He was an ardent defender of the Rosicrucians, and De Quincey
considers him to have been the immediate, as J.V. AndreÃ¤
was the remote, father of freemasonry. Fludd died on the 8th
of September 1637.

of the Rosicrucians (1887); De Quincey, The Rosicrucians and Freemasons;

His works were published in 6 vols., Oppenheim and Gouda, 1638.




FLÃœGEL, GUSTAV LEBERECHT (1802-1870), German
orientalist, was born at Bautzen on the 18th of February 1802.
He received his early education at the gymnasium of his native
town, and studied theology and philology at Leipzig. Gradually
he devoted his attention chiefly to Oriental languages, which he
studied in Vienna and Paris. In 1832 he became professor at the
FÃ¼rstenschule of St Afra in Meissen, but ill-health compelled him
to resign that office in 1850, and in 1851 he went to Vienna,
where he was employed in cataloguing the Arabic, Turkish and
Persian manuscripts of the court library. He died at Dresden
on the 5th of July 1870.


FlÃ¼gel&rsquo;s chief work is an edition of the bibliographical and encyclopaedic
lexicon of Haji Khalfa, with Latin translation (7 vols.,
London and Leipzig, 1835-1858). He also brought out an edition
of the Koran (Leipzig, 1834 and again 1893); then followed Concordantiae
Corani arabicae (Leipzig, 1842 and again 1898); Mani,
seine Lehren und seine Schriften (Leipzig, 1862); Die grammatischen
Schulen der Araber (Leipzig, 1862); and Ibn KutlÃ»bugas Krone der
Lebensbeschreibungen (Leipzig, 1862). An edition of KitÃ¢b-al-Fihrist,
prepared by him, was published after his death.




FLÃœGEL, JOHANN GOTTFRIED (1788-1855), German lexicographer,
was born at Barby near Magdeburg, on the 22nd of
November 1788. He was originally a merchant&rsquo;s clerk, but
emigrating to the United States in 1810, he made a special study
of the English language, and returning to Germany in 1819,
was in 1824 appointed lector of the English language in the university
of Leipzig. In 1838 he became American consul, and
subsequently representative and correspondent of the Smithsonian
Institution at Washington and several other leading
American literary and scientific institutions. He died at Leipzig
on the 24th of June 1855.


The fame of FlÃ¼gel rests chiefly on the VollstÃ¤ndige englisch-deutsche
und deutsch-englische WÃ¶rterbuch, first published in 2 vols.
(Leipzig) in 1830, which has had an extensive circulation not only
in Germany but in England and America. In this work he was
assisted by J. Sporschil, and a new and enlarged edition, edited by
his son Felix FlÃ¼gel (1820-1904), was published at Brunswick (1890-1892).
Another edition, in two volumes, edited by Prof. Immanuel
Schmidt and S. Tanger appeared (Brunswick, London &amp; New York)
in 1906. Among his other works are&mdash;VollstÃ¤ndige engl. Sprachlehre
(1824-1826); Triglotte, oder kaufmÃ¤nnisches WÃ¶rterbuch in drei
Sprachen, Deutsch, Englisch und FranzÃ¶sisch (1836-1840); Kleines
KaufmÃ¤nnisches HandwÃ¶rterbuch in drei Sprachen (1840); and
Praktisches Handbuch der engl. Handelscorrespondenz (1827, 9th ed.
1873). All these have passed through several editions. In addition,
FlÃ¼gel also published in the English language: A series of Commercial
Letters (Leipzig, 1822), a 9th edition of which appeared in
1874 under the title Practical Mercantile Correspondence and a
Practical Dictionary of the English and German Languages (2 vols.,
Hamburg and Leipzig, 1847-1852; 15th ed., Leipzig, 1891). The
last was continued and re-edited by his son Felix.




FLUKE (probably connected with the Ger. flach, flat), a name
given to several kinds of fish, flat in shape, especially to the
common flounder; also the name of a trematoid worm, resembling
a flounder in shape, which as a parasite infects the liver
and neighbouring organs of certain animals, especially sheep,
and causes liver-rot. The most common is the Fasciola hepatica
(see Trematodes). It is also the name of a species of kidney
potato. Probably from a resemblance to the shape of the fish,
&ldquo;fluke&rdquo; is the name given to the holding-plates, triangular in
shape, at the end of the arms of an anchor, and to the triangular
extremities of the tail of a whale. The use of the word as a slang
expression for a lucky accident appears to have been first applied
in billiards to an unintentional scoring shot.



FLUME (through an O. Fr. word flum, from the Lat. flumen,
a river), a word formerly used for a stream, and particularly
for the tail of a mill-race. It is used in America for a very
narrow gorge running between precipitous rocks, with a stream
575
at the bottom, but more frequently is applied to an artificial
channel of wood or other material for the diversion of a stream
of water from a river for purposes of irrigation, for running a sawmill,
or for various processes in the hydraulic method of gold-mining
(see Aqueduct).



FLUMINI MAGGIORE, a town of the province of Cagliari,
Sardinia, 10 m. by road N. of Iglesias, and 5 m. from the W. coast.
Pop. (1901) town 3908; commune 9647. It is the centre of
a considerable lead and zinc mining district. Three miles to the
S. are the ruins of a temple erected probably in the time of
Commodus (Corpus inscr. Lat. x., Berlin, 1883, No. 7539).
They seem to mark the site of Metalla (mines), a station on the
coast road from Sulci to Tharros, and the centre of the mining
district in Roman times. At Flumini Maggiore itself were found
two ingots of lead, one bearing a stamp with Hadrian&rsquo;s name.



FLUORANTHENE, C15H10, also known as idryl, a hydrocarbon
occurring with phenanthrene, pyrene, diphenyl, and other
substances in &ldquo;Stupp&rdquo; fat (the fat obtained in working up the
mercury ores in Idria), and also in the higher boiling fractions
of the coal tar distillate. It was discovered by R. Fittig in 1878,
who, with Gebhard and H. Liepmann, elucidated its constitution
(see Ann., 1879, 200, p. 1). The hydrocarbons are separated
from the &ldquo;Stupp&rdquo; by means of alcohol, the soluble portion on
distillation giving first phenanthrene and then a mixture of pyrene
and fluoranthene. From the tar distillate, the chrysene can be
fractionally precipitated, and the fluoranthene can be separated
from most of the pyrene by fractional distillation in a partial
vacuum. In either case the two hydrocarbons are finally
separated by fractional crystallization of their picrates, which
are then decomposed by ammonia. Fluoranthene crystallizes
in large slender needles or monoclinic tables, melting at 109-110Â°
C. and boiling at 250-251Â° C. (60 mm.). It is easily soluble in hot
alcohol, ether and carbon bisulphide. On oxidation with chromic
acid it forms a quinone, C15H8O2, and an &alpha;-diphenylene ketocarboxylic
acid  The picrate melts at 182-183Â° C.



FLUORENE (&alpha;-diphenylene methane), C13H10 or (C6H4)2CH2,
a hydrocarbon found in coal-tar. It is obtained from the higher
boiling fractions, after separation of naphthalene and anthracene,
by fractional distillation, the portion boiling between 290-340Â° C.
being taken. The fluorene is separated from this by placing it in
a freezing mixture, and is then redistilled or crystallized from
glacial acetic acid, or purified by means of its picrate. It may
be prepared by distilling diphenylene ketone over zinc dust,
or by heating it with hydriodic acid and phosphorus to 150-160Â°
C.; and also by passing the vapour of diphenyl methane through
a red hot tube. It crystallizes in colourless plates, possessing
a violet fluorescence, melting at 112-113Â° and boiling at 293-295Â°
C. By oxidation with chromic acid in glacial acetic acid solution,
it is converted into diphenylene ketone (C6H4)2Â·CO; whilst on
heating with hydriodic acid and phosphorus to 250-260Â° C. it
gives a hydro derivative of composition C18H22.



FLUORESCEIN, or Resorcin-Phthalein, C20H12O5, in
chemistry, a compound discovered in 1876 by A. v. Baeyer by
the condensation of phthalic anhydride with resorcin at 195-200Â°
C. (Ann., 1876, 183, p. 1). The two reacting substances are either
heated alone or with zinc chloride for some hours, and the melt
obtained is boiled out with water, washed by dilute alcohol,
extracted by means of sodium hydrate, and the solution so
obtained is precipitated by an acid. The precipitate is well
washed with water and then dried. By repeating this process
two or three times, the fluorescein may be obtained in a very pure
condition. It forms a yellow amorphous powder, insoluble in
water but soluble in alcohol, and crystallizing from the alcoholic
solution in small dark red nodules. It is readily soluble in solutions
of the caustic alkalis, the solution being of a dark red colour
and showing (especially when largely diluted with water) a
brilliant green fluorescence. It was so named on account of this
last character. By brominating fluorescein in glacial acetic acid
solution, eosin (tetrabromfluorescein) is obtained, the same
compound being formed by heating 3.5-dibrom-2.4-dioxybenzoylbenzoic
acid above its melting point (R. Meyer, Ber.,
1895, 28, p. 1576). It crystallizes from alcohol in yellowish red
needles, and dyes silk, wool, and mordanted cotton a fine pink
colour. When heated with caustic alkalis it yields dibromresorcin
and dibrommonoresorcin-phthalein. The corresponding
iodo compound is known as erythrosin. Fluorescein is readily
nitrated, yielding a di- or tetra-nitro compound according to
conditions. The entrance of the negative nitro group into the
molecule weakens the central pyrone ring in the fluorescein
nucleus and the di- and tetra-nitro compounds readily yield
hydrates (see J.T. Hewitt and B.W. Perkins, Jour. Chem. Soc.,
1900, p. 1326). By the action of ammonia or amines the di-nitro
fluoresceins are converted into yellow dyestuffs (F. Reverdin,
Ber., 1897, 30, p. 332). Other dyestuffs obtained from fluorescein
are safrosine or eosin scarlet (dibromdinitrofluorescein) and rose
Bengal (tetraiodotetrachlorfluorescein).


On fusion with caustic alkali, fluorescein yields resorcin,
C6H4(OH)2, and monoresorcin phthalein (dioxybenzoylbenzoic
acid), (HO)2C6H3Â·COÂ·C H4Â·COOH. With zinc dust and caustic
soda it yields fluorescin. By warming fluorescein with excess of
phosphorus pentachloride it yields fluorescein chloride, C20H10O3Cl2
(A. Baeyer), which crystallizes from alcohol in small prisms, melting
at 252Â° C. When heated with aniline and aniline hydrochloride,
fluorescein yields a colourless anilide (O. Fischer and E. Hepp, Ber.,
1893, 26, p. 2236), which is readily methylated by methyl iodide
and potash to a fluoresceinanilidedimethyl ether, which when heated
for six hours to 150Â° C. with acetic and hydrochloric acids, is hydrolysed
and yields a colourless fluoresceindimethyl ether, which melts
at 198Â° C. On the other hand, by heating fluorescein with caustic
potash, methyl iodide and methyl alcohol, a coloured (yellow)
dimethyl ether, melting at 208Â° C. is obtained (Fischer and Hepp).
By heating the coloured dimethyl ether with caustic soda, the
monomethyl ether is obtained (O. Fischer and E. Hepp, Ber., 1895,
28, p. 397); this crystallizes in triclinic tables, and melts at 262Â° C.
It is to be noted that the colourless monomethyl ether fluoresces
strongly in alkaline solution, the dimethyl ether of melting point
208Â° fluoresces only in neutral solution (e.g., in alcoholic solution),
and the dimethyl ether of melting point 198Â° C. only in concentrated
hydrochloric or sulphuric acid solution (Fischer and Hepp). Considerable
discussion has taken place as to the position held by the
hydroxyl groups in the fluorescein molecule, C. Graebe (Ber., 1895,
28, p. 28) asserting that they were in the ortho position to the linking
carbon atom of the phthalic anhydride residue. G. Heller (Ber.,
1895, 28, p. 312), however, showed that monoresorcin-phthalein
when brominated in glacial acetic acid gives a dibrom derivative
which, with fuming sulphuric acid, yields dibromxanthopurpurin
(1.3-dioxy-2.4-dibromanthraquinone), a reaction which is only
possible if the fluorescein (from which the monoresorcin-phthalein
is derived) contains free hydroxyl groups in the para position to the
linking carbon atom of the phthalic anhydride residue.

FLUORESCENCE. In a paper read before the Royal Society
of Edinburgh in 1833, Sir David Brewster described a remarkable
phenomenon he had discovered to which he gave the name of
&ldquo;internal dispersion.&rdquo; On admitting a beam of sunlight, condensed
by a lens, into a solution of chlorophyll, the green colouring
matter of leaves (see fig. 1), he was surprised to find that the
path of the rays within the fluid
was marked by a bright light of a
blood-red colour, strangely contrasting
with the beautiful green of the
fluid when seen in moderate thickness.
Brewster afterwards observed
the same phenomenon in various
vegetable solutions and essential
oils, and in some solids, amongst
which was fluor-spar. He believed
this effect to be due to coloured
particles held in suspension. A few
years later, Sir John Herschel independently
discovered that if a
solution of quinine sulphate, which, viewed by transmitted
light, appears colourless and transparent like water, were
illuminated by a beam of ordinary daylight, a peculiar blue
colour was seen in a thin stratum of the fluid adjacent to
the surface by which the light entered. The blue light was
unpolarized and passed freely through many inches of the
fluid. The incident beam, after having passed through the
stratum from which the blue light came, was not sensibly
enfeebled or coloured, but yet it had lost the power of
576
producing the characteristic blue colour when admitted into a
second solution of quinine sulphate. A beam of light modified
in this mysterious manner was called by Herschel &ldquo;epipolized.&rdquo;
Brewster showed that epipolic was merely a particular case of
internal dispersion, peculiar only in this respect, that the rays
capable of dispersion were dispersed with unusual rapidity.



Fig. 2.

The investigation of this phenomenon was afterwards taken
up by Sir G.G. Stokes, to whom the greater part of our present
knowledge of the subject is due. Stokes&rsquo;s first paper &ldquo;On the
Change of the Refrangibility of Light&rdquo; appeared in 1852. He
repeated the experiments of Brewster and Herschel, and considerably
extended them. These experiments soon led him to
the conclusion that the effect could not be due, as Brewster had
imagined, to the scattering of light by suspended particles, but
that the dispersed beam actually differed in refrangibility from
the light which excited it. He therefore termed it &ldquo;true internal
dispersion&rdquo; to distinguish it from the scattering of light, which
he called &ldquo;false internal dispersion.&rdquo; As this name, however,
is apt to suggest Brewster&rsquo;s view of the phenomenon, he afterwards
abandoned it as unsatisfactory, and substituted the word
&ldquo;fluorescence.&rdquo; This term, derived from fluor-spar after the
analogy of opalescence from opal, does not presuppose any theory.
To examine the nature of the fluorescence produced by quinine,
Stokes formed a pure spectrum of the sun&rsquo;s rays in the usual
manner. A test-tube, filled with a dilute solution of quinine
sulphate, was placed just outside the red end of the spectrum
and then gradually moved along the spectrum to the other
extremity. No fluorescence was observed as long as the tube
remained in the more luminous portion, but as soon as the violet
was reached, a ghost-like gleam of blue light shot right across
the tube. On continuing to move the tube, the blue light at
first increased in intensity and afterwards died away, but not
until the tube had been moved a considerable distance into the
ultra-violet part of the spectrum. When the blue gleam first
appeared it extended right across the tube, but just before
disappearing it was confined to a very thin stratum on the side
at which the exciting rays entered. Stokes varied this experiment
by placing a vessel filled with the dilute solution in a
spectrum formed by a train of prisms. The appearance is
illustrated diagrammatically in fig. 2. The greater part of the
light passed freely as if through water,
but from about half-way between the
Fraunhofer lines G and H to far beyond
the extreme violet, the incident rays
gave rise to light of a sky-blue colour,
which emanated in all directions from
the portion of the fluid (represented
white in fig. 2) which was under the
influence of the incident rays. The
anterior surface of the blue space coincided,
of course, with the inner surface
of the glass vessel. The posterior surface
marked the distance to which the incident rays were able
to penetrate before they were absorbed. This distance was at
first considerable, greater than the diameter of the vessel, but
decreased with great rapidity as the refrangibility of the incident
light increased, so that from a little beyond the extreme violet
to the end, the blue space was reduced to an excessively thin
stratum. This shows that the fluid is very opaque to the ultra-violet
rays. The fixed lines in the violet and invisible part of
the solar spectrum were represented by dark lines, or rather
planes, intersecting the blue region. Stokes found that the
fluorescent light is not homogeneous, for on reducing the incident
rays to a narrow band of homogeneous light, and examining the
dispersed beam through a prism, he found that the blue light
consisted of rays extending over a wide range of refrangibility,
but not into the ultra-violet.

Another method, which Stokes found especially useful in
examining different substances for fluorescence, was as follows.
Two coloured media were prepared, one of which transmitted
the upper portion of the spectrum and was opaque to the lower
portion, while the second was opaque to the upper and transparent
to the lower part of the spectrum. These were called by
Stokes &ldquo;complementary absorbents.&rdquo; No pair could be found
which were exactly complementary, of course, but the condition
was approximately fulfilled by several sets of coloured glasses
or solutions. One such combination consisted of a deep-blue
solution of ammioniacal copper sulphate and a yellow glass
coloured with silver. The two media together were almost
opaque. The light of the sun being admitted through a hole in
the window-shutter, a white porcelain tablet was laid on a shelf
fastened in front of the hole. If the vessel containing the blue
solution was placed so as to cover the hole, and the tablet was
viewed through the yellow glass, scarcely any light entered the
eye, but if a paper washed with some fluorescent liquid were laid
on the tablet it appeared brilliantly luminous. Different pairs
of complementary absorbents were required according to the
colour of the fluorescent light. This experiment shows clearly
that the light which passed through the first absorbent and
which would have been stopped by the second gave rise in the
fluorescent substance to rays of a different wave-length which
were transmitted by the second absorbent. Scattered light,
with which the true fluorescent light was often associated, was
eliminated by this method, being stopped by the second
absorbent.



Fig. 3.&mdash;Spectrum of Chlorophyll.

Fig. 4.&mdash;Spectrum of Aesculin.

Stokes also used a method, analogous to Newton&rsquo;s method of
crossed prisms, for the purpose of analysing the fluorescent light.
A spectrum was produced by means of a slit and a prism, the slit
being horizontal instead of vertical. The resulting very narrow
spectrum was projected on a white paper moistened with a
fluorescent solution, and viewed through a second prism with its
refracting edge perpendicular
to that of
the first prism. In
addition to the sloping
spectrum seen
under ordinary circumstances,
another
spectrum due to the
fluorescent light
alone, made its
appearance, as seen
in figs. 3 and 4. In
this spectrum the
colours do not run
from left to right,
but in horizontal
lines. Thus the dark
lines of the solar
spectrum lie across
the colours. The
spectra in figs. 3 and
4 were obtained by
V. Pierre with an
improved arrangement
of Stokes&rsquo;s method. It will be seen that, in the case
of chlorophyll, the whole spectrum, far into the ultra-violet,
gives rise to a short range of red fluorescent light, while
the effective part of the exciting light in the case of aesculin
(a glucoside occurring in horse-chestnut bark) begins a little
above the fixed line G and the fluorescent light covers a wide
range extending from orange to blue.

Besides the substances already mentioned, a large number
of vegetable extracts and some inorganic bodies are strongly
fluorescent. Stokes found that most organic substances show
signs of fluorescence. Green fluor-spar from Alston Moor
exhibits a violet, uranium glass a yellowish-green fluorescence.
Tincture of turmeric gives rise to a greenish light, and the extract
of seeds of Datura stramonium a pale green light. Ordinary
paraffin oil fluoresces blue. Barium platinocyanide, which is
much used in the fluorescent screens employed in work with the
RÃ¶ntgen rays, shows a brilliant green fluorescence with ordinary
light. Crystals of magnesium platinocyanide possess the
remarkable property of emitting a polarized fluorescent light,
577
the colour and plane of polarization depending on the position
of the crystal with respect to the incident beam, and, if polarized
light is used, on the plane of polarization of the latter.

Stokes&rsquo;s Law.&mdash;In all the substances examined by Stokes, the
fluorescent light appeared to be of lower refrangibility than the
light which excited it. Stokes considered it probable that this
lowering of the refrangibility of the light was a general law which
held for all substances. This is known as Stokes&rsquo;s law. It has
been shown, however, by E. Lommel and others, that this law
does not hold generally. Lommel distinguishes two kinds of
fluorescence. The bodies which exhibit the first kind are those
which possess strong absorption bands, of which only one remains
appreciable after great dilution. These bodies are always
strongly coloured and show anomalous dispersion and (in solids)
surface colour. In such cases, the maximum of intensity in the
fluorescent spectrum corresponds to the maximum of absorption.
Stokes&rsquo;s law is not obeyed, for a fluorescent spectrum can be produced
by means of homogeneous light of lower refrangibility
than a great part of the fluorescent light. The second kind of
fluorescence is the most common, and is exhibited by bodies which
show absorption only in the upper part of the spectrum, i.e.
they are usually yellow or brown or (if the absorption is in the
ultra-violet) colourless. The absorption bands also are different
from those of substances of the first kind, for they readily disappear
on dilution. A third class of bodies is formed by those
substances which exhibit both kinds of fluorescence.

Nature of Fluorescence.&mdash;No complete theory of fluorescence
has yet been given, though various attempts have been made to
explain the phenomenon. Fluorescence is closely allied to
phosphorescence (q.v.), the difference consisting in the duration
of the effect after the exciting cause is removed. Liquids which
fluoresce only do so while the exciting light is falling on them,
ceasing immediately the exciting light is cut off. In the case
of solids, on the other hand, such as fluor-spar or uranium glass,
the effect, though very brief, does not die away quite instantaneously,
so that it is really a very brief phosphorescence. The
property of phosphorescence has been generally attributed to
some molecular change taking place in the bodies possessing it.
That some such change takes place during fluorescence is rendered
probable by the fact that the property depends upon the state
of the sensitive substance; some bodies, such as barium platinocyanide,
fluorescing in the solid state but not in solution, while
others, such as fluorescein, only fluoresce in solution. Fluorescence
is always associated with absorption, but many bodies are
absorbent without showing fluorescence. A satisfactory theory
would have to account for these facts as well as for the production
of waves of one period by those of another, and the non-homogeneous
character of the fluorescent light. Quite recently W.
Voigt has sought to give a theory of fluorescence depending on
the theory of electrons. Briefly, this theory assumes that the
electrons which constitute the molecule of the sensitive body
can exist in two or more different configurations simultaneously,
and that these are in dynamical equilibrium, like the molecule
in a partially dissociated gas. If the electrons have different
periods of vibration in the different configurations, then it would
happen that the electrons whose period nearly corresponded with
that of the incident light would absorb the energy of the latter,
and if they then underwent a transformation into a different
configuration with a different period, this absorbed energy
would be given out in waves of a period corresponding to that of
the new configuration.

Applications of Fluorescence.&mdash;The phenomenon of fluorescence
can be utilized for the purpose of illustrating the laws of reflection
and refraction in lecture experiments since the path of
a ray of light through a very dilute solution of a sensitive substance
is rendered visible. The existence of the dark lines in the
ultra-violet portion of the solar spectrum can also be demonstrated
in a simple manner. In addition to the foregoing
applications, Stokes made use of this property for studying the
character of the ultra-violet spectrum of different sources of
illumination and flames. He suggested also that the property
would in some cases furnish a simple test for the presence of a
small quantity of a sensitive substance in an organic mixture.
Fluorescent screens are largely used in work with RÃ¶ntgen rays.
There appears to be some prospect of light being thrown on the
question of molecular structure by experiments on the fluorescence
of vapours. Some very interesting experiments in this
direction have been performed by R.W. Wood on the fluorescence
of sodium vapour.

FLUORINE (symbol F, atomic weight 19), a chemical element
of the halogen group. It is never found in the uncombined
condition, but in combination with calcium as fluor-spar CaF2
it is widely distributed; it is also found in cryolite Na3AlF6,
in fluor-apatite, CaF2Â·3Ca3P2O8, and in minute traces in sea-water,
in some mineral springs, and as a constituent of the enamel
of the teeth. It was first isolated by H. Moissan in 1886 by the
electrolysis of pure anhydrous hydrofluoric acid containing
dissolved potassium fluoride. The U-shaped electrolytic vessel
and the electrodes are made of an alloy of platinum-iridium,
the limbs of the tube being closed by stoppers made of fluor-spar,
and fitted with two lateral exit tubes for carrying off the gases
evolved. Whilst the electrolysis is proceeding, the apparatus
is kept at a constant temperature of &minus;23Â° C. by means of liquid
methyl chloride. The fluorine, which is liberated as a gas at
the anode, is passed through a well cooled platinum vessel,
in order to free it from any acid fumes that may be carried over,
and finally through two platinum tubes containing sodium
fluoride to remove the last traces of hydrofluoric acid; it is
then collected in a platinum tube closed with fluor-spar plates.
B. Brauner (Jour. Chem. Soc., 1894, 65, p. 393) obtained fluorine
by heating potassium fluorplumbate 3KFÂ·HFÂ·PbF4. At 200Â° C.
this salt decomposes, giving off hydrofluoric acid, and between
230-250Â° C. fluorine is liberated.

Fluorine is a pale greenish-yellow gas with a very sharp smell;
its specific gravity is 1.265 (H. Moissan); it has been liquefied,
the liquid also being of a yellow colour and boiling at -187Â° C.
It is the most active of all the chemical elements; in contact
with hydrogen combination takes place between the two gases
with explosive violence, even in the dark, and at as low a temperature
as &minus;210Â° C; finely divided carbon burns in the gas,
forming carbon tetrafluoride; water is decomposed even at
ordinary temperatures, with the formation of hydrofluoric acid
and &ldquo;ozonised&rdquo; oxygen; iodine, sulphur and phosphorus melt
and then inflame in the gas; it liberates chlorine from chlorides,
and combines with most metals instantaneously to form fluorides;
it does not, however, combine with oxygen. Organic compounds
are rapidly attacked by the gas.

Only one compound of hydrogen and fluorine is known,
namely hydrofluoric acid, HF or H2F2, which was first obtained
by C. Scheele in 1771 by decomposing fluor-spar with concentrated
sulphuric acid, a method still used for the commercial preparation
of the aqueous solution of the acid, the mixture being distilled
from leaden retorts and the acid stored in leaden or gutta-percha
bottles. The perfectly anhydrous acid is a very volatile colourless
liquid and is best obtained, according to G. Gore (Phil.
Trans., 1869, p. 173) by decomposing the double fluoride of
hydrogen and potassium, at a red heat in a platinum retort fitted
with a platinum condenser surrounded by a freezing mixture, and
having a platinum receiver luted on. It can also be prepared
in the anhydrous condition by passing a current of hydrogen
over dry silver fluoride. The pure acid thus obtained is a most
dangerous substance to handle, its vapour even when highly
diluted with air having an exceedingly injurious action on the
respiratory organs, whilst inhalation of the pure vapour is
followed by death. The anhydrous acid boils at 19Â°.5 C. (H.
Moissan), and on cooling, sets to a solid mass at &minus;102Â°.5 C,
which melts at &minus;92Â°.3 C. (K. Olszewski, Monats. fÃ¼r Chemie,
1886, 7, p. 371). Potassium and sodium readily dissolve in the
anhydrous acid with evolution of hydrogen and formation of
578
fluorides. The aqueous solution is strongly acid to litmus and
dissolves most metals directly. Its most important property is
that it rapidly attacks glass, reacting with the silica of the glass
to form gaseous silicon fluoride, and consequently it is used for
etching. T.E. Thorpe (Jour. Chem. Soc., 1889, 55, p. 163)
determined the vapour density of hydrofluoric acid at different
temperatures, and showed that there is no approach to a definite
value below about 88Â° C. where it reaches the value 10.29
corresponding to the molecular formula HF; at temperatures
below 88Â° C. the value increases rapidly, showing that the
molecule is more complex in its structure. (For references see
J.N. Friend, The Theory of Valency (1909), p. 111.) The aqueous
solution behaves on concentration similarly to the other halogen
acids; E. Deussen (Zeit. anorg. Chem., 1905, 44, pp. 300, 408;
1906, 49, p. 297) found the solution of constant boiling point
to contain 43.2% HF and to boil at 110Â° (750 mm.).


The salts of hydrofluoric acid are known as fluorides and are
easily obtained by the action of the acid on metals or their oxides,
hydroxides or carbonates. The fluorides of the alkali metals, of
silver, and of most of the heavy metals are soluble in water; those
of the alkaline earths are insoluble. A characteristic property of
the alkaline fluorides is their power of combining with a molecule of
hydrofluoric acid and with the fluorides of the more electro-negative
elements to form double fluorides, a behaviour not shown by other
metallic halides. Fluorides can be readily detected by their power
of etching glass when warmed with sulphuric acid; or by warming
them in a glass tube with concentrated sulphuric acid and holding a
moistened glass rod in the mouth of the tube, the water apparently
gelatinizes owing to the decomposition of the silicon fluoride formed.
The atomic weight of fluorine has been determined by the conversion
of calcium, sodium and potassium fluorides into the corresponding
sulphates. J. Berzelius, by converting silver fluoride
into silver chloride, obtained the value 19.44, and by analysing
calcium fluoride the value 19.16; the more recent work of H.
Moissan gives the value 19.05.

See H. Moissan, Le Fluor et ses composes (Paris, 1900).




FLUOR-SPAR, native calcium fluoride (CaF2), known also
as Fluorite or simply Fluor. In France it is called fluorine,
whilst the term fluor is applied to the element (F). All these
terms, from the Lat. fluere, &ldquo;to flow,&rdquo; recall the fact that the spar
is useful as a flux in certain metallurgical operations. (Cf. its
Ger. name Flussspat or Fluss.)



Fluor-spar crystallizes in the cubic system, commonly in
cubes, either alone or combined with the octahedron, rhombic
dodecahedron, four-faced cube, &amp;c. The four-faced cube has
been called the fluoroid. In fig. 1, a is the cube (100), d the
rhombic dodecahedron (110), and f the four-faced cube (310).
Fig. 2 shows a characteristic twin of interpenetrant cubes.
The crystals are sometimes polysynthetic, a large octahedron,
e.g., being built up of small cubes. The faces are often etched or
corroded. Cleavage is nearly always perfect, parallel to the
octahedron.

Fluor-spar has a hardness of 4, so that it is scratched by a knife,
though not so readily as calcite. Its specific gravity is about 3.2.
The colour is very variable, and often beautiful, but the mineral
is too soft for personal decoration, though it forms a handsome
material for vases, &amp;c. In some fluor-spar the colour is disposed
in bands, regularly following the contour of the crystal. As the
colour is usually expelled, or much altered, by heat, it is believed
to be due to an organic pigment, and the presence of hydrocarbons
has been detected in many specimens by G. Wyrouboff, and
other observers. H.W. Morse (Proc. Amer. Acad., 1906, p. 587)
obtained carbon monoxide and dioxide, hydrogen and nitrogen
and small quantities of oxygen from Weardale specimens by
heating. He concluded that the gases are due to the decomposition
of an organic colouring matter, which has, however, no
connexion with the fluorescence or thermo-luminescence of
the mineral. Certain crystals from Cumberland are beautifully
fluorescent, appearing purple with a bluish internal haziness
by reflected light, and greenish by transmitted light. Fluor-spar,
though cubic, sometimes exhibits weak double refraction,
probably due to internal tension. Many kinds of fluor-spar are
thermo-luminescent, i.e. they glow on exposure to a moderate
heat, and the name of chlorophane has been given to a variety
which exhibits a green glow. The mineral also phosphoresces
under the RÃ¶ntgen rays. Cavities containing liquid occasionally
occur in crystals of fluor-spar, notably in the greasy green cubes
of Weardale in Durham. A dark violet fluor-spar from WÃ¶lsendorf
in Bavaria, evolves an odour of ozone when struck, and has
been called antozonite. Ozone is also emitted by a violet fluor-spar
from QuinciÃ©, dep. RhÃ´ne, France. In both cases the spar
evolves free fluorine, which ozonizes the air.

Fluor-spar is largely employed by the metallurgist, especially
in lead-smelting, and in the production of ferro-silicon and
ferro-manganese. It is also used in iron and brass foundries,
and has been found useful as a flux for certain gold-ores and in
the reduction of aluminium. It is used as a source of hydrofluoric
acid, which it evolves when heated with sulphuric acid. The
mineral is also used in the production of opal glass and enamel
ware. In consequence of its low refractive and dispersive power,
colourless pellucid fluor-spar is valuable in the construction of
apochromatic lenses, but this variety is rare. The dark violet
fluor-spar of Derbyshire, known locally as &ldquo;Blue John,&rdquo; is
prized for ornamental purposes. It occurs almost exclusively at
Tray Cliff, near Castleton. The dark purple spar, called by the
workmen &ldquo;bull beef,&rdquo; may be changed, by heat, to a rich
amethystine tint. Being very brittle, the spar is rather difficult
to work on the lathe, and is often toughened by means of resin.
F. Corsi, the eminent Italian antiquary, held that fluor-spar was
the material of the famous murrhine vases.

Fluor-spar is a mineral of very wide distribution. Some of the
finest crystals occur in the lead-veins of the Carboniferous
Limestone series in the north of England, especially at Weardale,
Allendale and Alston Moor. It is also found in the lead and
copper-mines of Cornwall and S. Devon, notably near Liskeard,
where fine crystals have been found, with faces of the six-faced
octahedron replacing the corners of the cube. In Cornwall fluor-spar
is known to the miners as &ldquo;cann.&rdquo; Fine yellow fluor-spar
occurs in some of the Saxon mines, and beautiful rose-red
octahedra are found in the Alps, near GÃ¶schenen. Many
localities in the United States yield fluor-spar, and it is worked
commercially in a few places, notably at Rosiclare in southern
Illinois.



FLUSHING, formerly a township and a village of Queens county,
New York, U.S.A., on Long Island, at the head of Flushing
Bay, since the 1st of January 1898 a part of the borough of
Queens, New York City. Flushing is served by the Long Island
railroad and by electric lines. It was settled in 1644 by a company
of English non-conformists who had probably been residents of
Flushing in Holland, from which the new place took its name.
Subsequently a large number of Quakers settled here, and in
1672 George Fox spent some time in the township. Before the
War of Independence Flushing was the country-seat of many rich
New Yorkers and colonial officials.



FLUSHING (Dutch Vlissingen), a fortified seaport in the
province of Zeeland, Holland, on the south side of the island of
Walcheren, at the mouth of the estuary of the western Scheldt,
4 m. by rail S. by W. of Middelburg, with which it is also connected
by steam tramway and by a ship canal. There is a steam
ferry to Breskens and Ter Neuzen on the coast of Zeeland-Flandres.
Pop. (1900) 18,893. An important naval station
and fortress up to 1867, Flushing has since aspired, under the
care of the Dutch government, to become a great commercial
port. In 1872 the railway was opened which, in conjunction
579
with the regular day and night service of steamers to Queenborough
in the county of Kent, forms one of the main routes
between England and the east of Europe. In 1873 the great
harbour, docks and canal works were completed. Yet the
navigation of the port remains far behind that of Rotterdam or
Antwerp, the tonnage being in 1899 about 7.9% of that of the
kingdom. As a summer resort, however, Flushing has acquired
considerable popularity, sea-baths and a large modern hotel
being situated on the fine beach about three-quarters of a mile
north-west of the town. It possesses a town hall, containing a
collection of local antiquities, a theatre, an exchange, an academy
of sciences and a school of navigation. The Jakobskerk, or
Jacob&rsquo;s church, founded in 1328, contains monuments to Admiral
de Ruyter (1607-1676) and the poet Jacob Bellamy (1757-1786),
who were natives of Flushing. The chief industries of the town
are connected with the considerable manufacture of machinery,
the state railway-workshops, shipbuilding yards, Krupp iron
and steel works&rsquo; depot, brewing, and oil and soap manufacture.
The chief imports are colonial produce and wine, wood and coal.
The exports include agricultural produce (wheat and beans),
shrimps and meat.



FLUTE, a word adapted from O. Fr. fleÃ¼te, modern flÃ»te; from
O. Fr. have come the Span. flauta, Ital. flauto and Ger. FlÃ¶te.
The New English Dictionary dismisses the derivations suggested
from Lat. flatuare or flavitare; ultimately the word must be
referred to the root seen in &ldquo;blow,&rdquo; Lat. flare, Ger. blasen, &amp;c.

1. In music &ldquo;flute&rdquo; is a general term applied to wood-wind
instruments consisting of a pipe pierced with lateral holes and
blown directly through the mouthpiece without the intervention
of a reed. The flute family is classified according to the mouthpiece
used to set in vibration the column of air within the tube:
i.e. (1) the simple lateral mouth-hole or embouchure which
necessitates holding the instrument in a transverse position;
(2) the whistle or fipple mouthpiece which allows the performer
to hold the instrument vertically in front of him. There is a
third class of pipes included among the flutes, having no mouthpiece
of any sort, in which the column of air is set in vibration by
blowing obliquely across the open end of the pipe, as in the
ancient Egyptian nay, and the pan-pipe or syrinx (q.v.). The
transverse flute has entirely superseded the whistle flute, which
has survived only in the so-called penny whistle, in the &ldquo;flute-work&rdquo;
of the organ (q.v.), and in the French flageolet.

The Transverse Flute or German Flute (Fr. flÃ»te traversiÃ¨re,
flÃ»te allemande: Ger. FlÃ¶te, QuerflÃ¶te, Zwerchpfeiff, Schweitzerpfeiff;
Ital. flauto traverso) includes the concert flute known both
as flute in C and as flute in D, the piccolo (q.v.) or octave flute,
and the fife (q.v.). The modern flute consists of a tube open at
one end and nominally closed at the other by means of a plug
or cork stopper: virtually, however, the tube is an open one
giving the consecutive harmonic series of the open pipe or of a
stretched string. The primitive flute was made in one piece,
but the modern instrument is composed of three adjustable
joints. (1) The head-joint, plugged at the upper end and containing
at about one-third of the length the mouth-hole or embouchure.
This embouchure, always open when the instrument
is being played, converts the closed tube into an open one, in an
acoustical sense. (2) The body, containing the holes and keys
necessary to produce the scale which gave the flute its original
designation of D flute, the head and body together, when the
holes are closed, giving the fundamental note D. Before the
invention of keys, this fundamental note and the notes obtained
by the successive opening of the six holes produced the diatonic
scale of D major. All other semitones were obtained by what
is known as cross fingering (Fr. doigtÃ© fourchu; Ger. Gabelgriffe).
It became usual to consider this the typical fingering nomenclature,
whatever the fundamental note given out by the flute,
and to indicate the tonality by the note given out when the
six lateral holes are covered by the fingers. The result is
that the tonality is always a tone lower than the name of
the instrument indicates. Thus the D flute is really in C,
the F flute is E&#9837;, &amp;c. (3) The foot-joint or tail-joint containing
the two additional keys for C&#9839; and C which extend the
compass downwards, completing the chromatic scale of C in the
fundamental octave.

The compass of the modern flute is three octaves with
chromatic semitones from  The sound is produced
by holding the flute transversely with the embouchure
turned slightly outwards, the lower lip resting on the nearer
edge of the embouchure, and blowing obliquely across, not
into, the orifice. The flat stream of air from the lips, known
as the air-reed, breaks against the sharp outer edge of the
embouchure. The current of air, thus set in a flutter, produces
in the stationary column of air within the tube a series of pulsations
or vibrations caused by the alternate compression and rarefaction
of the air and generating sounds of a pitch proportional
to the length of the stationary column, which is practically
somewhat longer than the length of the tube.1 The length of this
column is varied by opening the lateral finger-holes. The current
or air-reed thus acts upon the air column within the flute, without
passing through the tube, as a plectrum upon a string, setting it
in vibration. The air column of the flute is the sound-producer,
whereas in instruments with reed mouthpieces the vibrating
reed is more properly the sound-producer, while the air column,
acting as a resonating medium, reinforces the note of the reed by
vibrating synchronously with it. If the angle2 at which the
current of air is directed against the outer edge of the embouchure
be made less acute and the pressure of the breath be at the same
time increased, the frequency of the alternate pulses of compression
and rarefaction within the tube will be increased two,
three or fourfold, forming a corresponding number of nodes and
loops which results in harmonics or upper partials, respectively
the octave, the twelfth, the double octave. By this means sounds
of higher pitch are produced without actually shortening the
length of the column of air by means of lateral holes. The
acoustic theory of sound-production in the flute is one on which
there is great diversity of opinion. The subject is too vast to be
treated here, but readers who wish to pursue it may consult
the works of Rockstro,3 Helmholtz,4 and others.5 The effect of
boring lateral holes in pipes is to shorten the vibrating length of
the air column, which may be regarded as being effective only
between the hole in question and the mouthpiece. In order to
obtain this result the diameter of the hole should be equal to that
of the bore; as long as the holes were covered by the fingers,
this was obviously impossible. The holes, therefore, being smaller
than the laws of acoustics demand, have to be placed proportionally
nearer the mouthpiece in order to avoid deepening the pitch
and deadening the tone. This principle was understood by wind-instrument
makers of classic Greece (see Aulos and Clarinet),
and has been explained by Chladni6 and Gottfried Weber.7

Messrs. Rudall, Carte &amp; Co.
Fig. 2.&mdash;Boehm Cylinder Flute. Rockstro Model.

The bore of the early flute with six finger-holes was invariably
cylindrical throughout, but towards the end of the 17th century
a modification took place, the head joint alone remaining
cylindrical while the rest of the bore assumed the form of a cone
having its smallest diameter at the open end of the tube. The
580
conoidal bore greatly improved the quality of tone and the
production of the higher harmonics of the third octave. Once
the conical bore had been adopted, the term flute was exclusively
applied to the new instruments, the smaller flutes, then
cylindrical, used in the army being designated fife (q.v.). At
the present day in England, France and America, the favourite
mode of construction is that introduced by Theobald Boehm,
and known as the &ldquo;cylinder flute with the parabolic head,&rdquo;
of which more will be said further on. The successive opening
of the holes and keys on the flute produces the chromatic scale
of the first or fundamental octave. By increasing the pressure
of the breath and slightly altering the position of the lips over
the mouth-hole, the same fingering produces the notes of the
fundamental octave in the next octave higher. The third octave
of the compass is obtained by the production of the higher
harmonics (Fr. sons harmoniques; Ger. FlageolettÃ¶ne), of the
fundamental scale, facilitated by the opening of certain of the
finger-holes as &ldquo;vent holes.&rdquo; The quality of tone depends
somewhat on the material of which the flute is made; silver and
gold produce a liquid tone of exquisite delicacy suitable for solo
music, cocus-wood and ebonite a rich mellow tone of considerable
power suitable for orchestral music. The tone differs further
in the three registers, the lowest being slightly rough, the medium
sweet and elegiac, and the third bird-like and brilliant. The
proportions, position and form of the stopper and of the air
chamber situated between it and the embouchure are mainly
influential in giving the flute its peculiar slightly hollow timbre,
due to the paucity of the upper partials of which according to
Helmholtz8 only the octave and twelfth are heard. Mr Blaikley9
states, however, that when the fundamental D is played, he can
discern the seventh partial. The technical capabilities of the
flute are practically unlimited to a good player who can obtain
sustained notes diminuendo and crescendo, diatonic and chromatic
scales and arpeggios both legato and staccato, leaps,
turns, shakes, &amp;c. By the articulation with the tongue of the
syllables te-ke or ti-ke repeated quickly for groups of double notes,
or of te-ke-ti for triplets, an easy effective staccato is produced,
known respectively as double or triple tonguing, a device understood
early in the 16th century and mentioned by Martin
Agricola,10 who gives the syllables as de for sustained notes,
di-ri for shorter notes, and tel-lel-lel for staccato passages in
quick tempo.11




Musical instruments, such as flutes, in which a column of air is
set in vibration by regular pulsations derived from a current of air
directed by the lips of the executant against the side of the orifice
serving as embouchure, appear to be of very ancient origin. The
Hindus, Chinese and Japanese claim to have used these modes of
blowing from time immemorial. The ancient Egyptians had a long
pipe held obliquely and blown across the end of the pipe itself at its
upper extremity; it was known as SaÃ¯b-it12 and was frequently
figured on the monuments. The same instrument, called &ldquo;nay,&rdquo;
is still used in Mahommedan countries. The oblique aulos of the
Greeks, plagiaulos,13 was of Egyptian origin and was perhaps at first
blown from the end as described above,14 since we know that the
Greeks were familiar with that method of blowing in the syrinx
or pan-pipe. The instruments preserved at the British Museum15
having lateral embouchures show, however, that they were also
acquainted&mdash;probably through the Hindus&mdash;with the transverse
flute, although in the case of these specimens a reed must
have been inserted into the mouth-hole or no sound would
have been obtained.

Tope at Amar&#257;bati, British Museum.

The high antiquity of a lateral embouchure in Europe
is generally admitted; the flute evidently penetrated
from the East at some period not yet determined. A
transverse flute is seen on Indian
sculptures of the Gandhara
school showing Greek influence,
and dating from the beginning
of our era (fig. 3). But although
the transverse flute was evidently
known to the Greeks and
Romans, it did not find the same
favour as the reed instruments known as auloi. We have no
evidence of the survival of the transverse flute after the fall of the
Roman empire until it filtered through from Byzantine sources
during the early middle ages. Instances of the flute occur on a
group of caskets16 of Italo-Byzantine work of the 9th or 10th century,
while of purely Byzantine origin we find examples of flutes in Greek
581
MSS.17 preserved in Paris, at the British Museum and elsewhere.
There is moreover in the cathedral of St Sophia at Kiev18 an orchestra
depicted on frescoes said to date from the 11th century; among
the musicians is a flautist.

The first essentially western European trace of the transverse
flute occurs in a German MS. of the 12th century, the celebrated
Hortus deliciarum of the abbess Herrad von Landsperg.19 Fol. 221
shows a syren playing upon the transverse flute, which Herrad
explains in a legend as tibia; in the vocabulary the latter is translated
swegel. In the 13th century it occurs among the miniatures of
the fifty-one musicians in the beautiful MS. Las Cantigas de Santa
Maria in the Escorial, Madrid.20 Eustache Deschamps, a French
poet of the 14th century, in one of his ballads, makes mention of the
&ldquo;flute traversaine,&rdquo; and we are justified in supposing that he refers
to the transverse flute. It had certainly acquired some vogue in
the 15th century, being figured in an engraving in Sebastian Virdung&rsquo;s
celebrated work,21 where it is called &ldquo;Zwerchpfeiff,&rdquo; and, with
the drums, it already constituted the principal element of the
military music. Agricola (op. cit.) alludes to it as the &ldquo;Querchpfeiff&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Schweizerpfeiff,&rdquo; the latter designation dating, it is
said, from the battle of Marignan (1515), when the Swiss troops
used it for the first time in war.

From Agricola onwards transverse flutes formed a complete family,
said to comprise the discant, the alto and tenor, and the bass&mdash; respectively.
Praetorius22 designates
the transverse flute as
&ldquo;Flauta traversa&rsquo; Querpfeiff&rdquo;
and &ldquo;QuerflÃ¶t,&rdquo; and gives the
pitch of
the bass
in

the tenor
and alto
in

and the
discant
in

as varieties
then
in use. A
flute concert at that time included two discants, four altos or
tenors, and two basses. The same author distinguishes between the
&ldquo;Traversa&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Schweizerpfeiff&rdquo; or fife (which he also calls
&ldquo;Feldpfeiff,&rdquo; i.e. military flute), although the construction was the
same. There were
two kinds of
&ldquo;Feldpfeiff,&rdquo; in

and

respectively; they were
employed exclusively
with the military drum.

Mersenne&rsquo;s23 account of the transverse flute, then designated &ldquo;flÃ»te
d&rsquo;Allemagne&rdquo; or &ldquo;flÃ»te allemande&rdquo; in France, and an &ldquo;Air de Cour&rdquo;
for four flutes in his work lead us to believe that there were then in
use in France
the soprano
flute in

the tenor
or alto
flute in

and the bass
flute descending
to
.
The museum of the Conservatoire Royal of Brussels possesses
specimens of all these varieties except the last. All of them are
laterally pierced with six finger-holes; they have a cylindrical bore,
and are fashioned out of a single piece of wood. Their compass consists
of two octaves and a fifth. Mersenne&rsquo;s tablature for fingering
the flute differs but little from those of Hotteterre-le-Romain24 and
Eisel25 for the diatonic scale; he does not give the chromatic semitones
and the flute had as yet no keys.

Brussels Museum.

The largest bass flute in the Brussels museum is in

at the French normal pitch A 435 double vibrations per
second. It measures 0.95 m. from the centre of the blow orifice to
the lower extremity of the tube. The disposition of the lateral holes
is such that it is impossible to cover them with the fingers if the
flute is held in the ordinary way. The instrument
must be placed against the mouth
in an almost vertical direction, inclining the
extremity of the tube either to the right or
the left. This inconvenient position makes
it necessary that the instrument should be
divided into two parts, enabling the player
to turn the head joint that the embouchure
may be most commodiously approached by
the lips, which is not at all easy. The first
and fourth of the six lateral holes are
double in order to accommodate both right- and
left-handed players, the holes not in
use being stopped up with wax. The bass
flute shown in fig. 4 is the facsimile of an
instrument in the Museo Civico of Verona.
The original, unfortunately no longer fit for
use, is nevertheless sufficiently well preserved
to allow of all its proportionate
measurements being given. The lowest
note, E&#9837;, is obtained with a remarkable
amplitude of sound, thus upsetting a very
prevalent opinion that it is impossible to
produce by lateral insufflation sounds which
go a little lower than the ordinary limit
downwards of the modern orchestral flute.26

The bass flute cited by Mersenne should
not differ much from that of the Museo
Civico at Verona. We suppose it to have
been in , and that it was furnished
with an open key like that which was
applied to the recorders (flÃ»tes douces) of
the same epoch, the function of the key
being to augment by another note the compass
of the instrument in the lower part. A
bass flute in G similar to the one in fig. 5
is figured and described in Diderot and
D&rsquo;Alembert&rsquo;s encyclopaedia 27 (1751). According
to Quantz,28 it was in France and
about the middle of the 17th century that
the first modifications were introduced in
the manufacture of the flute. The improvements
at this period consisted of the
abandonment of the cylindrical bore in
favour of a conical one, with the base of the cone forming the
head of the instrument. At the same time the flute was
made of three separate pieces called head, body, and tail or foot,
which were ultimately further subdivided. The body or middle
joint was divided into two pieces, so that the instrument could be
tuned to the different pitches then in use by a replacement with
longer or shorter pieces. It was probably about 1677, when Lully
introduced the German flute into the opera, that recourse was had
for the first time to keys, and that the key of D# was applied to the
lower part of the instrument.29 The engraving of B. Picart, dated
1707, given in Hotteterre&rsquo;s book, represents the flute as having
reached the stage of improvement of which we have just spoken. In
1726 Quantz,30 finding himself in Paris, had a second key applied to
the flute, placed nearly at the same height as the first, that of the
, intended to differentiate the D# and the E&#9837;.31 This
innovation was generally well received in Germany, but
does not appear to have met with corresponding success
in other countries. In France and England manufacturers adopted
it but rarely; in Italy it was declared useless.32 About the same
582
time flutes were constructed with the lower extremity lengthened
sufficiently to produce the fundamental C, and furnished with a
supplementary key to produce the C&#9839;. This innovation, spoken of
by Quantz,33 did not meet with a very favourable reception, and was
shortly afterwards abandoned. Passing mention may be made of
the drawing of a flute with a C key in the Music-Saal of J.F.B.
Majer (Nuremberg, 1741), p. 45.

The tuning of the instrument to different pitches was effected
by changes in the length, and notably by substituting a longer or
shorter upper piece in the middle joint. So wide were the differences
in the pitches then in use that seven such pieces for the upper portion
of it were deemed necessary. The relative proportions between the
different parts of the instrument being altered by these modifications
in the length, it was conceived that the just relation could be re-established
by dividing the foot into two pieces, below the key.
These two pieces were adjusted by means of a tenon, and it was
asserted that, in this way, the foot could be lengthened proportionately
to the length of the middle joint. Flutes thus improved took
the name of &ldquo;flÃ»tes Ã  registre.&rdquo; The register system was, about
1752, applied by Quantz to the head joint34 and, the embouchure
section being thus capable of elongation, it was allowable to the performer,
according to the opinion of this professor, to lower the pitch
of the flute a semitone, without having recourse to other lengthening
pieces, and without disturbing the accuracy of intonation.

The upper extremity of the flute, beyond the embouchure orifice,
is closed by means of a cork stopper. On the position of this cork
depends, in a great measure, the accurate tuning of the flute. It is
in its right place when the accompanying octaves  are
true. Quantz, in speaking of this accessory, mentions
the use of a nut-screw to give the required position to
the cork.35 He does not name the inventor of this appliance,
but, according to Tromlitz,36 the improvement was due to
Quantz himself. The invention goes back to 1726.

When the Method of Quantz appeared there were still in use,
besides the orchestral flute in D, the little fourth flute in G, the
low fourth flute in A, and the flÃ»te d&rsquo;amour a note higher; in
France they had, moreover, the little octave flute in D (octave).
A bass flute in D had also been attempted (see fig. 5). When
Ribock published his Bemerkungen Ã¼ber die FlÃ¶te37 the flute
had already the five keys here shown. 
This author states that the inventor of these
new keys is not known to him, but that
either Kusder, a musical instrument-maker in London, or Johann
Georg Tromlitz of Leipzig was the originator, since he has not been
able to trace those keys on the flutes of any other maker. Although
Tromlitz does not claim for himself the invention of the keys for F,
G&#9839; and B&#9837;, he states that &ldquo;he had occupied himself for several years
in applying these keys so as not to augment the difficulty of playing,
but on the contrary to render the handling of them as easy as
possible.&rdquo;38 In the later work published in 1800,39 however, he
seems to attribute the invention of these keys to Richard Potter of
London; he says that he has never yet been fortunate enough to
come across a good flute by that maker&mdash;&ldquo;the flute has certainly
gained by the addition of the keys for F, G&#9839; and B&#9837;, but this is not
everything, for on such a flute much must perforce be left unattempted....
Only a flute with eight keys according to my invention
is capable of everything.&rdquo; It would seem, moreover, from
circumstantial evidence stated clearly and on good authority by
Rockstro40 that the keys for F, G&#9839; and B&#9837; must have been used
first in England and made by Richard Potter before 1774. The
higher key of C adopted from 1786 by Tromlitz, we believe to have
been first recommended by Ribock (1782).41 Tromlitz in Ãœber
FlÃ¶ten describes at length what may be termed the first systematic
effort to overcome the difficulties created by the combination of
open holes and closed keys. He attempted to solve the question
by determining the positions of the holes according to the exigencies
of fingering instead of subordinating them to the more arbitrary
theories connected with the musical scale.

In 1785 Richard Potter improved Quantz&rsquo;s slide applied to the
head joint as well as to the register of the foot by a double system
of tubes forming double sliding air-tight joints. In the document42
describing this improvement Potter patented the idea of lining the
holes with silver tubes and of adapting metal conical valves to the
keys. Potter&rsquo;s patent conical valves were an adaptation of the
contrivance first invented by J.F. Boie or Boye of GÃ¶ttingen,43
who used pewter for the plugs, and silver for lining the holes. The
keys mentioned in the patent were four&mdash;D&#9839;, F, G&#9839;, A&#9839;. The idea
of extending the compass of the flute downwards was taken up again
about the same time by two players of the flute in London named
Tacet and Florio. They devised a new disposition of the keys C
and C#, and confided the execution of their invention to Potter. In
Dr Arnold&rsquo;s New Instructions for the German Flute occurs a tablature,
the engraving of which goes back to the end of the 18th century, and
bears the following title, &ldquo;A Complete Drawing and Concise Scale
and Description of Tacet and Florio&rsquo;s new invented German Flute,
with all the additional keys explained.&rdquo; It explains the use of six
keys&mdash;C, C&#9839;, D&#9839;, F, G&#9839;, A&#9839;&mdash;that are not always figured, because
the employment of so many keys was at once admitted. Tromlitz
himself, who, however, made flutes with nine keys&mdash;adding E&#9837;,
another F, and C&#9838;, declared that he was not in favour of so great
a complication, and that he preferred the flute with only two keys,
D&#9839; and E&#9837;, with a register foot joint and a cork nut-screw at the
head joint. This instrument met all requirements. He was always
much opposed to the use of the old keys for C&#9838; and C&#9839;, because they
altered the recognised quality of tone of the instrument. When
Tromlitz published his method, the family of flutes had become
modified. It comprehended only the typical flute in D, the flÃ»te
d&rsquo;amour a minor third lower, a &ldquo;third&rdquo; flute a minor third higher,
and, finally, the little octave flute.

While Tromlitz was struggling in Germany with the idea of
augmenting the compass of the flute downwards by employing open
keys for C&#9838; and C&#9839;, an Italian, Giovanni Batista Orazi,44 increased
the scale of the instrument downwards by the application of five
new keys, viz. B, B&#9837;, A, A&#9837;, and G. At the same time that he
produced this invention 45 he conceived the plugging of the lateral
holes by the valve keys then recently invented by Potter. But
it was hardly possible to obtain a perfect plugging of seven lateral
holes with the aid of as many keys, for the control of which there
were only the two little fingers, and therefore this invention of
Orazi proved a failure.

In 1808 the Rev. Frederick Nolan,46 of Stratford, near London,
conceived an open key, the lever of which, terminating by a ring,
permitted the closing of a lateral hole at the same time the key was
being acted upon. The combination in this double action is the
embryo of the mechanism that a little later was to transform the
system of the flute. Two years later Macgregor,47 a musical-instrument
maker in London, constructed a bass flute an octave lower
than the ordinary flute. The idea was not new, as is proved by the
existence of the bass flute mentioned above. The difference between
the two instruments lies in the mechanism of the keys. That employed
by Macgregor consisted of a double lever, a contrivance
dating from before the middle of the 18th century, of which the
application is seen in an oboe of large dimensions preserved in the
National Museum at Munich.48

In 1811 Johann Nepomuk Capeller invented the extra D[natural] hole
and key, which is still in constant use on every flute of modern
construction.49

About 1830 the celebrated French flautist Tulou added two more
keys, those of F&#9839; and C&#9839;, and a key, called
&ldquo;de cadence,&rdquo; to facilitate the accompanying
shakes.

To increase the number of keys, to improve
their system of plugging, and to extend the 
scale of the instrument in the lower region,&mdash;these
had hitherto been the principal problems dealt with in
the improvement of the flute. No maker, no inventor to whose
labours we have called attention, had as yet devoted his attention
to the rational division of the column of air by means of the
lateral holes. In 1831 Theobald Boehm, a Bavarian, happening to
be in London, was struck with the power of tone the celebrated
English performer Charles Nicholson drew from his instrument.
Boehm learned, and not without astonishment, that his English
colleague obtained this result by giving the lateral holes a much
greater diameter than was then usually admitted. About the
same time Boehm made the acquaintance of an amateur player
named Gordon, who had effected certain improvements; he had
bored the lateral hole for the lower E, and had covered it with a
key, while he had replaced the key for F with a ring. These innovations
set Boehm about attempting a complete reform of the
583
instrument.50 He went resolutely to work, and during the year 1832
he produced the new flute which bears his name. This instrument
is distinguished by a new mechanism of keys, as well as by larger
holes disposed along the tube in geometrical progression.

Boehm&rsquo;s system had preserved the key of G&#9839; open; Coche,51 a
professor in the Paris Conservatoire, assisted by Auguste Buffet
the younger, a musical-instrument maker in that city, modified
Boehm&rsquo;s flute by closing the G&#9839; with a key, wishing thus to render
the new fingering more conformable to the old. He thus added a
key, facilitating the shake upon C&#9839; with D&#9839;, and brought about
some other changes in the instrument of less importance.

Boehm had not, however, altered the bore of the flute, which had
been conical from the end of the 17th century. In 1846, however,
he made further experiments, and the results obtained were put in
practice by the construction of a new instrument, of which the body
was given a cylindrical bore, while the diameter of the head was
modified at the embouchure, the head-joint becoming parabolic
(see fig. 2). The inventor thus obtained a remarkable equality in
the tones of the lower octave, a greater sonorousness, and a perfect
accuracy of intonation, by establishing the more exact proportions
which a column of air of cylindrical form permitted.

The priority of Boehm&rsquo;s invention was long contested, his detractors
maintaining that the honour of having reconstructed the
flute was due to Gordon. But an impartial investigation vindicates
the claim of the former to the invention of the large lateral
holes.52 His greatest title to fame is the invention of the mechanism
which allows the production of the eleven chromatic semitones
intermediate between the fundamental note and its first harmonic
by means of eleven holes so disposed that in opening them successively
they shorten the column of air in exact proportional
quantities.53 Boehm (Essays, &amp;c.) published a diagram or scheme to
be adopted in determining the position of the note-holes of wind
instruments for every given pitch. This diagram gives the position
of the intermediate holes which he had been enabled to
establish by a rule of proportion based on the law of the lengths
of strings.

The Boehm flute, notwithstanding the high degree of perfection
it has reached, has not secured unanimous favour; even now there
are players who prefer the ordinary flute. The change of fingering
required for some notes, the great delicacy and liability to derangement
of the mechanism, have something to do with this. In England
especially, the ordinary flute retains many partisans, thanks to
the improvements introduced by a clever player, Abel Siccama, in
1845 (Patent No. 10,553). He bored the lateral holes of E and A
lower, and covered them with open keys. He added some keys, and
made a better disposition of the other lateral holes, of which he
increased the diameter, producing thus a sonorousness almost equal
to that of the Boehm flute, while yet preserving the old fingering
for the notes of the first two octaves. But in spite of these improvements
the old flute will not bear an impartial comparison with that
of Boehm.

A flute constructed on a radically new system by Signor Carlo
Tommaso Georgi and introduced in 1896 places the technique of
the instrument on an entirely new and simple basis. The principal
features of this flute consist in an embouchure placed at the upper
extremity of the tube instead of at the side, which allows the instrument
to be held in a perpendicular position; no tuning cork is required.
There are eleven holes mathematically placed in the tube
which give the semitones of the scale; there are no keys. The
eleven holes are fingered by the fingers and thumbs, the C&#9839; hole
being closed by the side of the left fore-finger. All the notes are
obtained by means of simple fingering as far as G&#9839; of the third
octave, the remaining notes of which are produced by cross-fingering.
For the convenience of players with short fingers keys can be added,
and the head of the Georgi flute can be used with any cylinder flute.
The compass of the Georgi flute is almost the same as that of
the concert flute; viz.  If the lower C and C&#9839; are
required, extra holes and keys can be added.
Everything that is possible on the Boehm flute is
possible on the Georgi and more, owing to the simplicity
of the fingering; each finger having but one duty to perform,
all trills are equally easy. The tone is the true flute tone, brilliant
and sympathetic.54

The old English fipple flute, or flÃ»te Ã  bec, is described under the
headings Recorder and Flageolet.

2. In architecture the name &ldquo;flute&rdquo; is given to the vertical
channels (segmental, semicircular or elliptical in horizontal
section) employed on the shafts of columns in the classic styles.
The flutes are separated one from the other by an &ldquo;arris&rdquo; in
the Doric order and by a &ldquo;fillet&rdquo; in the Ionic and Corinthian
orders. The earliest fluted columns are those in Egypt, at first
with plain faces without any sinking, subsequently at Karnac
(1400 B.C.) with a segmental sinking equal in depth to about
one-seventh of the width of the flute. The columns flanking one
of the &ldquo;beehive&rdquo; tombs at Mycenae have segmental flutes and
are the earliest Greek examples. In two of the earliest Doric
temples at Metapontum and Syracuse (temple of Apollo) the
flutes are also segmental, but in later examples in order to
emphasize the arris they were formed of three arcs and are known
as &ldquo;false ellipses,&rdquo; and this applies to nearly all the fluting in
Greek examples whether belonging to the Doric, Ionic or
Corinthian orders. The number of flutes varies, there being 52
in the archaic temple of Diana at Ephesus and from 30 to 52
flutes in the Persian columns according to the diameter of the
column. In the Greek Doric column 20 is the usual number, but
there are 16 only in the temples of Sunium, Assos, Segesta and
the temple of Apollo at Syracuse; 18 in one of the temples of
Selinus and the temple of Diana at Syracuse, and 24 in the temple
of Neptune at Paestum. The depth of the flute also varies;
in the Propylaea at Athens the radius is equal to the width of
the flute and the flute is segmental. In the Parthenon the radius
of the central part of the flute is greater than the width, but the
smaller arcs on either side accentuate better the arris. A similar
accentuation is found in the Ionic and Corinthian orders, where
the flutes are separated by fillets, and their section is always
elliptical in Greek work, the depth of the flute, however, being
always greater than in the Doric order. Thus, in the temple of
Ilissus and the Ionic column in the cella of the temple at Bassae,
the depth is about one-quarter of the width, in the Propylaea
at Priene it is about one-third, and in the Erechtheum and other
examples of the Greek Ionic order it is little more than one-half.
The width of the fillet also varies, being as a rule one quarter of
the width of the flute; and the same applies to the Greek
Corinthian order. In the Roman Doric, Ionic and Corinthian
orders, the flute is either segmental or semicircular, its depth
being about one third of the width in the Doric column, and in all
Ionic, Corinthian and Composite columns half the width of the
flute. The fillet also is much broader in Roman examples, being
about one-third of the width of the flute. In Roman columns
sometimes the flutes of the lower part of the shaft, about one-third
of the height, are partly filled with a convex moulding,
&ldquo;cabling&rdquo; being the usual term applied to this treatment.
The French architects of the 16th and 17th centuries carried this
decorative feature much farther, and in the Tuileries and the
Louvre carved a series of leaves in the flutes. In a few Italian
buildings, instead of the fluting of the column being vertical,
it twines round the column and is known as spiral fluting; a fine
example is found in the Bevilacqua palace at Verona by San
Michele. Fluting is sometimes introduced into capitals, as in
the tomb of Mylasa, and in friezes, as in the theatre at Cnidos,
the Incantada at Salonica, and a doorway at Patara. In one
of the museums at Rome is a fine sarcophagus, the sides of which
are sculptured with flutes in waved lines. The coronas of many
of the Roman temples were carved with flutes. In medieval
buildings, fluting was occasionally introduced in imitation of
Roman work, as in the churches of central Syria and of Autun and
Langres in France, but in the south of Italy and Sicily it would
seem to have been brought in as a variety of treatment, in the
decoration of the shafts carrying the arches of cloisters, as at
Monreale in Sicily and in those of St John Lateran and St Paul-outside-the-Walls
at Rome.

15 There are two flutes at the British Museum (Catal. No. 84, 4-9
and 5 and 6), belonging to the Castellani collection, made of wood
encased in bronze in which the mouthpiece, consisting of the head
of a maenad, has a lateral hole bored obliquely into the main tube.
This hole was probably intended for the reception of a reed. The
pipe is stopped at the end beyond the mouthpiece as in the modern
flute. There are six holes. See also the plagiaulos from Halicarnassus
in the British Museum described by C.T. Newton in History
of Discoveries at Halicarnassus (London), vol. ii. p. 339. The Louvre
has two ancient statues (from the villa Borghese) representing
satyrs playing upon transverse flutes. Unfortunately these marbles
have been restored, especially in the details affecting our present
subject, and are therefore examples of no value to us. Another
statue representing a flute-player occurs in the British Museum.
The instrument has been supposed to be a transverse flute, but
erroneously, for the insufflation of the lateral tube against which
the instrumentalist presses his lips, could not, without the intervention
of a reed, excite the vibratory movement of the column of
air.

FLUX (Lat. fluxus, a flowing; this being also the meaning
of the English term in medicine, &amp;c.), in metallurgy, a substance
introduced in the smelting of ores to promote fluidity, and to
remove objectionable impurities in the form of a slag. The
584
substances in commonest use are:&mdash;lime or limestone, to slag
off silica and silicates, fluor-spar for lead, calcium and barium
sulphates and calcium phosphate, and silica for removing basic
substances such as limestone. Other substances are also used,
but more commonly in assaying than in metallurgy. Sodium
and potassium carbonates are valuable for fluxing off silica;
mixed with potassium nitrate sodium carbonate forms a valuable
oxidizing fusion mixture; &ldquo;black flux&rdquo; is a reducing flux
composed of finely divided carbon and potassium carbonate, and
formed by deflagrating a mixture of argol with Â¼ to Â½ its weight
of nitre. Borax is very frequently employed; it melts to a clear
liquid and dissolves silica and many metallic oxides. Potassium
bisulphate is useful in the preliminary treatment of refractory
aluminous ores. Litharge and red lead are used in silver and
gold assays, acting as solvents for silica and any metallic oxides
present.



FLY (formed on the root of the supposed original Teut. fleugan,
to fly), a designation applied to the winged or perfect state of
many insects belonging to various orders, as in butterfly (see
Lepidoptera), dragon-fly (q.v.), may-fly (q.v.), caddis-fly (q.v.),
&amp;c.; also specially employed by entomologists to mean any
species of the two-winged flies, or Diptera (q.v.). In ordinary
parlance fly is often used in the sense of the common house-fly
(Musca domestica); and by English colonists and sportsmen
in South Africa in that of a species of tsetse-fly (Glossina), or a
tract of country (&ldquo;belt&rdquo;) in which these insects abound (see
Tsetse-Fly).

Apart from the house-fly proper (Musca domestica), which in
England is the usual one, several species of flies are commonly
found in houses; e.g. the Stomoxys calcitrans, or stable-fly;
Pollenia rudis, or cluster-fly; Muscina stabulans, another stable-fly;
Calliphora erythrocephala, blue-bottle fly, blow-fly or meat-fly,
with smaller sorts of blue-bottle, Phormia terraenovae and
Lucilia caesar; Homalomyia canicularis and brevis, the small
house-fly; Scenopinus fenestralis, the black window-fly, &amp;c.
But Musca domestica is far the most numerous, and in many
places, especially in hot weather and in hot climates, is a regular
pest. Mr L.O. Howard (Circular 71 of the Bureau of Entomology
U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Washington, 1906) says that in 1900
he made a collection of the flies in dining-rooms in different parts
of the United States, and out of a total of 23,087 flies, 22,808
were the common house-fly. Its geographical distribution is
of the widest, and its rapidity of breeding, in manure and door-yard
filth, so great that, as a carrier of germs of disease, especially
cholera and typhoid, the house-fly is now recognized as a potent
source of danger; and various sanitary regulations have been
made, or precautions suggested, for getting rid of it. These are
discussed by Mr Howard in the paper referred to, but in brief
they all amount to measures of general hygiene, and the isolation,
prompt removal, or proper sterilization of the animal or human
excrement in which these flies breed.



FLYCATCHER, a name introduced in ornithology by Ray,
being a translation of the Muscicapa of older authors, and
applied by Pennant to an extremely common English bird, the
M. grisola of Linnaeus. It has since been used in a general and
very vague way for a great many small birds from all parts of the
world, which have the habit of catching flies on the wing. Ornithologists
who have trusted too much to this characteristic and
to certain merely superficial correlations of structure, especially
those exhibited by a broad and rather flat bill and a gape beset
by strong hairs or bristles, have associated under the title of
Muscicapidae an exceedingly heterogeneous assemblage of
forms much reduced in number by later systematists. Great
advance has been made in establishing as independent families
the Todidae and Eurylaemidae, as well as in excluding from it
various members of the Ampelidae, Cotingidae, Tyrannidae,
Vireonidae, Mniotiltidae, and perhaps others, which had been
placed within its limits. These steps have left the Muscicapidae
a purely Old-World family of the order Passeres, and the chief
difficulty now seems to lie in separating it from the Campephagidae
and the Laniidae. Only a very few of the forms of flycatchers
(which, after all the deductions above mentioned, may be
reckoned to include some 60 genera or subgenera, and perhaps
250 species) can here be even named.1

The best-known bird of this family is that which also happens
to be the type of the Linnaean genus Muscicapa&mdash;the spotted
or grey flycatcher (M. grisola). It is a common summer visitant
to nearly the whole of Europe, and is found throughout Great
Britain, though less abundant in Scotland than in England, as
well as in many parts of Ireland, where, however, it seems to be
but locally and sparingly distributed. It is one of the latest
migrants to arrive, and seldom reaches the British Islands till the
latter part of May, when it may be seen, a small dust-coloured
bird, sitting on the posts or railings of gardens and fields, ever
and anon springing into the air, seizing with an audible snap
of its bill some passing insect as it flies, and returning to the spot
it has quitted, or taking up some similar station to keep watch as
before. It has no song, but merely a plaintive or peevish call-note,
uttered from time to time with a jerking gesture of the
wings and tail. It makes a neat nest, built among the small twigs
which sprout from the bole of a large tree, fixed in the branches
of some plant trained against a wall, or placed in any hole of
the wall itself that may be left by the falling of a brick or stone.
The eggs are from four to six in number, of a pale greenish-blue,
closely blotched or freckled with rust-colour. Silent and inconspicuous
as is this bird, its constant pursuit of flies in the closest
vicinity of houses makes it a familiar object to almost everybody.
A second British species is the pied flycatcher (M. atricapilla),
a much rarer bird, and in England not often seen except in the
hilly country extending from the Peak of Derbyshire to Cumberland,
and more numerous in the Lake District than elsewhere.
It is not common in Scotland, and has only once been observed
in Ireland. More of a woodland bird than the former, the
brightly-contrasted black and white plumage of the cock,
together with his agreeable song, readily attracts attention
where it occurs. It is a summer visitant to all western Europe,
but farther eastward its place is taken by a nearly allied species
(M. collaris) in which the white of the throat and breast extends
like a collar round the neck. A fourth European species (M.
parva), distinguished by its very small size and red breast, has
also strayed some three or four times to the extreme south-west
of England. This last belongs to a group of more eastern range,
which has received generic recognition under the name of Erythrosterna,
and it has several relations in Asia and particularly in
India, while the allies of the pied flycatchers (Ficedula of Brisson)
are chiefly of African origin, and those of the grey or spotted
flycatcher (Muscicapa proper2) are common to the two continents.

One of the most remarkable groups of Muscicapidae is that
known as the paradise flycatchers, forming the genus Tchitrea of
Lesson. In nearly all the species the males are distinguished by
the growth of exceedingly long feathers in their tail, and by their
putting on, for some part of the year at least, a plumage generally
white, but almost always quite different from that worn by the
females, which is of a more or less deep chestnut or bay colour,
though in both sexes the crown is of a glossy steel-blue. They are
found pretty well throughout Africa and tropical Asia to Japan,
and seem to affect the deep shade of forests rather than the open
country. The best-known species is perhaps the Indian T.
paradisi; but the Chinese T. incii, and the Japanese T. princeps,
from being very commonly represented by the artists of those
nations on screens, fans and the like, are hardly less so; and the
cock of the last named, with his bill of a pale greenish-blue and
585
eyes surrounded by bare skin of the same colour&mdash;though these
are characters possessed in some degree by all the species&mdash;seems
to be the most beautiful of the genus. T. bourbonnensis,
which is peculiar to the islands of Mauritius and RÃ©union,
appears to be the only species in which the outward difference of
the sexes is but slight. In T. corvina of the Seychelles, the adult
male is wholly black, and his middle tail-feathers are not only
very long but very broad. In T. mutata of Madagascar, some
of the males are found in a blackish plumage, though with the
elongated median rectrices white, while in others white predominates
over the whole body; but whether this sex is here
actually dimorphic, or whether the one dress is a passing phase
of the other, is at present undetermined. Some of the African
species, of which many have been described, seem always to
retain the rufous plumage, but the long tail-feathers serve to
mark the males.

A few other groups are distinguished by the brilliant blue they
exhibit, as Myiagra azurea, and others as Monarcha (or Arses)
chrysomela by their golden yellow. The Australian forms assigned
to the Muscicapidae are very varied. Sisura inquieta has some
of the habits of a water-wagtail (Motacilla), and hence has received
the name of &ldquo;dishwasher,&rdquo; bestowed in many parts of
England on its analogue; and the many species of Rhipidura
or fantailed flycatchers, which occur in various parts of the
Australian Region, have manners still more singular&mdash;turning
over in the air, it is said, like a tumbler pigeon, as they catch their
prey; but concerning the mode of life of the majority of the
Muscicapidae, and especially of the numerous African forms,
hardly anything is known.
(A. N.)

 

1 Of the 30 genera or subgenera which Swainson included in his
Natural Arrangement and Relations of the Family of Flycatchers
(published in 1838), at least 19 do not belong to the Muscicapidae at
all, and one of them, Todus, not even to the order Passeres. It is
perhaps impossible to name any ornithological work whose substance
so fully belies its title as does this treatise. Swainson wrote it filled
with faith in the so-called &ldquo;Quinary System&rdquo;&mdash;that fanciful theory,
invented by W.S. Macleay, which misled and kept back so many of
the best English zoologists of his generation from the truth,&mdash;and,
unconsciously swayed by his bias, his judgment was warped to fit
his hypothesis.

2 By some writers this section is distinguished as Butalis of Boie,
but to do so seems contrary to rule.




FLYGARE-CARLÃ‰N, EMILIE (1807-1892), Swedish novelist,
was born in StrÃ¶mstad on the 8th of August 1807. Her father,
Rutger Smith, was a retired sea-captain who had settled down
as a small merchant, and she often accompanied him on the
voyages he made along the coast. She married in 1827 a doctor
named Axel Flygare, and went with him to live in the province
of SmÃ¥land. After his death in 1833 she returned to her old home
and published in 1838 her first novel, Waldemar Klein. In the
next year she removed to Stockholm, and married, in 1841, the
jurist and poet, Johan Gabriel CarlÃ©n (1814-1875). Her house
became a meeting-place for Stockholm men of letters, and for
the next twelve years she produced one or two novels annually.
The premature death of her son Edvard Flygare (1829-1853),
who had already published three books, showing great promise,
was followed by six years of silence, after which she resumed her
writing until 1884. The most famous of her tales are Rosen pÃ¥
TistelÃ¶n (1842; Eng. trans. The Rose of TistelÃ¶n, 1842);
Enslingen pÃ¥ JohannesskÃ¤ret (1846; Eng. trans. The Hermit,
4 vols., 1853); and Ett KÃ¶pemanshus i skÃ¤rgÃ¥rden (1859; The
Merchant&rsquo;s House on the Cliffs). Fru CarlÃ©n published in 1878
Minnen af svenskt fÃ¶rfattarlif 1840-1860, and in 1887-1888
three volumes of EfterskÃ¶rd frÃ¥n en 80- Ã¥rings fÃ¶rfattarbana,
containing her last tales. She died at Stockholm on the 5th of
February 1892. Her daughter, Rosa CarlÃ©n (1836-1883), was
also a popular novelist.


Emilie Flygare-CarlÃ©n&rsquo;s novels were collected in thirty-one
volumes (Stockholm, 1869-1875).




FLYING BUTTRESS, in architecture, the term given to a
structural feature employed to transmit the thrust of a vault
across an intervening space, such as an aisle, chapel or cloister,
to a buttress built outside the latter. This was done by throwing
a semi-arch across to the vertical buttress. Though employed
by the Romans and in early Romanesque work, it was generally
masked by other constructions or hidden under a roof, but in
the 12th century it was recognized as rational construction and
emphasized by the decorative accentuation of its features, as in
the cathedrals of Chartres, Le Mans, Paris, Beauvais, Reims,
&amp;c. Sometimes, owing to the great height of the vaults, two
semi-arches were thrown one above the other, and there are
cases where the thrust was transmitted to two or even three
buttresses across intervening spaces. As a vertical buttress,
placed at a distance, possesses greater power of resistance to
thrust than if attached to the wall carrying the vault, vertical
buttresses as at Lincoln and Westminster Abbey were built
outside the chapterhouse to receive the thrust. All vertical
buttresses are, as a rule, in addition weighted with pinnacles to
give them greater power of resistance.



FLYING COLUMN, in military organization, an independent
corps of troops usually composed of all arms, to which a particular
task is assigned. It is almost always composed in the course of
operations, out of the troops immediately available. Mobility
being its raison d&rsquo;Ãªtre, a flying column is when possible composed
of picked men and horses accompanied with the barest minimum
of baggage. The term is usually, though not necessarily, applied
to forces under the strength of a brigade. The &ldquo;mobile columns&rdquo;
employed by the British in the South African War of 1899-1902,
were usually of the strength of two battalions of infantry, a
battery of artillery, and a squadron of cavalry&mdash;almost exactly
half that of a mixed brigade. Flying columns are mostly used in
savage or guerrilla warfare.



&ldquo;FLYING DUTCHMAN,&rdquo; a spectre-ship popularly believed to
haunt the waters around the Cape of Good Hope. The legend
has several variants, but the commonest is that which declares
that the captain of the vessel, Vanderdecken, was condemned for
his blasphemy to sail round the cape for ever, unable to &ldquo;make&rdquo;
a port. In the Dutch version the skipper is the ghost of the Dutch
seaman Van Straaten. The appearance of the &ldquo;Flying Dutchman&rdquo;
is considered by sailors as ominous of disaster. The German
legend makes one Herr Von Falkenberg the hero, and alleges that
he is condemned to sail for ever around the North Sea, on a ship
without helm or steersman, playing at dice for his soul with
the devil. Sir Walter Scott says the &ldquo;Flying Dutchman&rdquo; was
originally a vessel laden with bullion. A murder was committed
on board, and thereafter the plague broke out among the crew,
which closed all ports to the ill-fated craft. The legend has been
used by Wagner in his opera Der fliegende HollÃ¤nder.



FLYING-FISH, the name given to two different kinds of fish.
The one (Dactylopterus) belongs to the gurnard family (Triglidae),
and is more properly called flying gurnard; the other (Exocoetus)
has been called flying herring, though more nearly allied to the
gar-pike than to the herring. Some other fishes with long
pectoral fins (Pterois) have been stated to be able to fly, but this
has been proved to be incorrect.



Fig. 1.&mdash;Dactylopterus volitans.

The flying gurnards are much less numerous than the Exocoeti
with regard to individuals as well as species, there being only
three or four species known of the former, whilst more than fifty
have been described of the latter, which, besides, are found in
numerous shoals of thousands. The Dactylopteri may be readily
distinguished by a large bony head armed with spines, hard
keeled scales, two dorsal fins, &amp;c. The Exocoeti have thin,
deciduous scales, only one dorsal fin, and the ventrals placed
far backwards, below the middle of the body; some have long
barbels at the chin. In both kinds the pectoral fins are greatly
prolonged and enlarged, modified into an organ of flight, and in
many species of Exocoetus the ventral fins are similarly enlarged,
and evidently assist in the aerial evolutions of these fishes.
Flying-fishes are found in the tropical and sub-tropical seas only,
and it is a singular fact that the geographical distribution of the
two kinds is nearly identical. Flying-fish are more frequently
586
observed in rough weather and in a disturbed sea than during
calms; they dart out of the water when pursued by their
enemies or frightened by an approaching vessel, but frequently
also without any apparent cause, as is also observed in many
other fishes; and they rise without regard to the direction of
the wind or waves. The fins are kept quietly distended, without
any motion, except an occasional vibration caused by the air
whenever the surface of the wing is parallel with the current of
the wind. Their flight is rapid, greatly exceeding that of a ship
going 10 m. an hour, but gradually decreasing in velocity and not
extending beyond a distance of 500 ft. Generally it is longer
when the fishes fly against, than with or at an angle to, the wind.
Any vertical or horizontal deviation from a straight line is not
caused at the will of the fish, but by currents of the air; thus they
retain a horizontally straight course when flying with or against
the wind, but are carried towards the right or left whenever the
direction of the wind is at an angle with that of their flight.
However, it sometimes happens that the fish during its flight
immerses its caudal fin in the water, and by a stroke of its tail
turns towards the right or left. In a calm the line of their flight is
always also vertically straight or rather parabolic, like the course
of a projectile, but it may become undulated in a rough sea,
when they are flying against the course of the waves; they then
frequently overtop each wave, being carried over it by the
pressure of the disturbed air. Flying-fish often fall on board of
vessels, but this never happens during a calm or from the lee side,
but during a breeze only and from the weather side. In day time
they avoid a ship, flying away from it, but during the night
when they are unable to see, they frequently fly against the
weather board, where they are caught by the current of the air,
and carried upwards to a height of 20 ft. above the surface of the
water, whilst under ordinary circumstances they keep close to it.
All these observations point clearly to the fact that any deflection
from a straight course is due to external circumstances, and not
to voluntary action on the part of the fish.



Fig. 2.&mdash;Exocoetus callopterus.

A little Malacopterygian fish about 4 in. long has recently been
discovered in West Africa which has the habits of a fresh-water
flying-fish. It has been named Pantodon buchholzi. It has very
large pectoral fins with a remarkable muscular process attached
to the inner ray. It lives in fresh-water lakes and rivers in the
Congo region, and has been caught in its flight above the water
in a butterfly-net.



FLYING-FOX, or, more correctly, Fox-Bat. The first name
is applied by Europeans in India to the fruit-eating bats of the
genus Pteropus, which contains more than half the family
(Pteropidae). This genus is confined to the tropical regions of the
Eastern hemisphere and Australia. It comprises numerous
species, a considerable proportion of which occur in the islands
of the Malay Archipelago. The flying-foxes are the largest of
the bats, the kalong of Java (Pteropus edulis) measuring about
a foot in length, and having an expanse of wing-membrane
measuring 5 ft. across. Flying-foxes are gregarious, nocturnal
bats, suspending themselves during the day head-downwards
by thousands from the branches of trees, where with their wings
gathered about them, they bear some resemblance to huge
shrivelled-up leaves or to clusters of some peculiar fruit. In
Batchian, according to Wallace, they suspend themselves chiefly
from the branches of dead trees, where they are easily caught
or knocked down by sticks, the natives carrying them home in
basketfuls. They are then cooked with abundance of spices,
and &ldquo;are really very good eating, something like hare.&rdquo; Towards
evening these bats bestir themselves, and fly off in companies
to the village plantations, where they feed on all kinds of fruit,
and so numerous and voracious are they that no garden crop
has much chance of being gathered which is not specially protected
from their attacks. The flying-fox of India (Pteropus
medius) is a smaller species, but is found in great numbers
wherever fruit is to be had in the Indian peninsula.






Pigmy African Flying-Squirrel
(Idiurus zenkeri).

FLYING-SQUIRREL, properly the name of such members of
the squirrel-group of rodent mammals as have a parachute-like
expansion of the skin of the flanks, with attachments to the
limbs, by means of which they are able to take long flying-leaps
from tree to tree. The parachute is supported by a cartilage
attached to the wrist or carpus; in addition to the lateral
membrane, there is a narrow one from the cheek along the front
of each shoulder to the wrist, and in the larger species a third
(interfemoral) connecting the hind-limbs with the base of the long
tail. Of the two widely distributed genera, Pteromys includes
the larger and Sciuropterus
the smaller species.
The two differ in certain
details of dentition, and
in the greater development
in the former of the
parachute, especially the
interfemoral portion,
which in the latter is
almost absent. In Pteromys
the tail is cylindrical
and comparatively thin,
while in Sciuropterus it is
broad, flat and laterally
expanded, so as to compensate
for the absence
of the interfemoral membrane
by acting as a
supplementary parachute.

In general appearance
flying-squirrels resemble
ordinary squirrels,
although they are even
more beautifully coloured.
Their habits,
food, &amp;c., are also very
similar to those of the
true squirrels, except that
they are more nocturnal,
and are therefore less
often seen. The Indian flying-squirrel (P. oral) leaps with its
parachute extended from the higher branches of a tree, and
descends first directly and then more and more obliquely, until
the flight, gradually becoming slower, assumes a horizontal
direction, and finally terminates in an ascent to the branch or
trunk of the tree to which it was directed. The presence of these
rodents at night is made known by their screaming cries. Sciuropterus
is represented by S. velucella in eastern Europe and
northern Asia, and by a second species in North America, but the
other species of this genus and all those of Pteromys are Indo-Malayan.
A third genus, Eupetaurus, typified by a very large,
long-haired, dark-grey species from the mountains to the north-west
of Kashmir (Eu. cinereus), differs from all other members of
the squirrel-family by its tall-crowned molar teeth. It has a
total length of 37 in., of which 22 are taken up by the tail.

In Africa the name of flying-squirrel is applied to the members
of a very different family of rodents, the Anomaluridae, which are
provided with a parachute. Since, however, this parachute is
absent in some members of the family, the most distinctive
character is the presence of a double row of spiny scales on the
under surface of the tail, which apparently aid in climbing.
The flying species are also distinguished from ordinary flying-squirrels
by the circumstance that the additional bone serving
for the support of the fore part of the flying-membrane rises
587
from the elbow-joint instead of from the wrist. The family is
represented by two flying genera, Anomalurus and Idiurus; the
latter containing only one very minute species (shown in the cut)
characterized by its small ears and elongated tail. Most of the
species are West African. In habits these rodents appear to be
very similar to the true flying-squirrels. The species without a
parachute constitutes the genus Zenkerella, and looks very like
an ordinary squirrel (see Rodentia).

In Australia and Papua the name flying-squirrel is applied
to such marsupials as are provided with parachutes; animals
which naturalists prefer to designate flying-phalangers (see
Marsupialia)
(R. L.*)



FLYSCH, in geology, a remarkable formation, composed
mainly of sandstones, soft marls and sandy shales found extending
from S.W. Switzerland eastward along the northern Alpine zone
to the Vienna basin, whence it may be followed round the
northern flanks of the Carpathians into the Balkan peninsula.
It is represented in the Pyrenees, the Apennines, the Caucasus
and extends into Asia; similar flysch-like deposits are related
to the Himalayas as the European formations are to the Alps.
The Flysch is not of the same age in every place; thus in the
western parts of Switzerland the oldest portions probably belong
to the Eocene period, but the principal development is of
Oligocene age; as it is traced eastward we find in the east Alps
that it descends into the upper Cretaceous, and in the Vienna
region and the Carpathians it contains intercalations which clearly
indicate a lower Cretaceous horizon for the lower parts. It
appears indeed that this type of formation was in progress of
deposition at one point or another in the regions enumerated
above from Jurassic to late Tertiary times. The absence of
fossils from enormous thicknesses of Flysch makes the correlation
with other formations difficult; often the only indications
of organisms are the abundant markings supposed to represent
Algae (Chondrites, &amp;c.), which have given rise to the term
&ldquo;Hieroglyphic-sandstone.&rdquo; The most noteworthy exceptions
are perhaps the Oligocene fish-bed of Glarus, the Eocene nummulitic
beds in Calabria, and the Aptychus beds of Waidhofen.
Local phases of the Flysch have received special names; it is
the &ldquo;Vienna&rdquo; or &ldquo;Carpathian&rdquo; sandstone of those regions;
the &ldquo;macigno&rdquo; (a soft sandstone with calcareous cement) of
the Maritime Alps and Apennines; the &ldquo;scagliose&rdquo; (scaly clays)
and &ldquo;alberese&rdquo; (limestones) of the same places are portions of
this formation. The gris de Menton, the gris d&rsquo;Annot of the
Basses Alps, and the gris d&rsquo;Embrun of Chaillot appear in Switzerland
as the gris de Taveyannaz. At several places the upper
layers of the Flysch are iron-stained, as in the region of LÃ©man
and at the foot of the Dent du Midi; it is then styled the &ldquo;Red-Flysch.&rdquo;
Lenticular intercalations of gabbro, diabase, &amp;c., occur
in the Flysch in Calabria on the Pyrenees. Large exotic blocks of
granite, gneiss and other crystalline rocks in coarse conglomerates
are found near Vienna, near Sonthofen in Bavaria, near Lake Thun
(Wild Flysch) and at other points, which have been variously
regarded as indications of glaciation or of coastal conditions.



FO&#268;A (pronounced FÃ¡wtcha), a town of Bosnia, situated at
the confluence of the Drina and &#268;ehotina rivers, and encircled
by wooded mountains. Pop. (1895) 4217. The town is the headquarters
of a thriving industry in silver filigree-work and inlaid
weapons, for which it was famous. With its territories enclosed
by the frontiers of Montenegro and Novi Bazar, Fo&#269;a, then
known as Chocha, was the scene of almost incessant border
warfare during the middle ages. No monuments of this period
are left except the Bogomil cemeteries, and the beautiful mosques,
which are the most ancient in Bosnia. The three adjoining
towns of Fo&#269;a, Gora&#382;da and Ustikolina were trading-stations
of the Ragusans in the 14th century, if not earlier. In the 16th
century, Benedetto Ramberti, ambassador from Venice to the
Porte, described the town, in his Libri Tre delle Cose dei Turchi,
as Cozza, &ldquo;a large settlement, with good houses in Turkish style,
and many shops and merchants. Here dwells the governor of
Herzegovina, whose authority extends over the whole of Servia.
Through this place all goods must pass, both going and returning,
between Ragusa and Constantinople.&rdquo;



FOCHABERS, a burgh of barony and village of Elginshire,
Scotland. Pop. (1901) 981. It is delightfully situated on the
Spey, about 9 m. E. by S. of Elgin, the terminus of a branch of
the Highland railway connecting at Orbliston Junction with the
main line from Elgin to Keith. The town was rebuilt in its
present situation at the end of the 18th century, when its earlier
site was required for alterations in the grounds of Gordon Castle,
in which the old town cross still stands. The streets all lead at
right angles to the central square, where fairs and markets are
held. The public buildings include a library and reading-room,
the court-house and the Milne school, named after Alexander
Milne, who endowed it with a legacy of Â£20,000. Adjoining the
town, surrounded by a park containing many magnificent old
trees, stands Gordon Castle, the chief seat of the duke of
Richmond and Gordon, erected in the 18th century. The antiquary
George Chalmers (1742-1825) and the composer William
Marshall (1748-1833) were natives of the burgh.



FOCSHANI (Rumanian Foc&#351;ani, sometimes incorrectly written
Fokshani or Fokshan), the capital of the department of Putna,
Rumania; on the river Milcov, which formed the ancient frontier
of the former principalities of Moldavia and Walachia. Pop.
(1900) 23,783; of whom 6000 were Jews. The chief buildings
are the prefecture, schools, synagogues, and many churches,
including those of the Armenians and Protestants. Focshani
is a commercial centre of some importance, the chief industries
being oil and soap manufacture and tannery. A large wine trade
is also carried on, and corn is shipped in lighters to Galatz. The
annual fair is held on the 29th of April. Government explorations
in the vicinity of this town show it to be rich in minerals,
such as iron, copper, coal and petroleum. The line Focshani-Galatz
is covered by a very strong line of fortifications, known
as the Sereth Line. A congress between Russian and Turkish
diplomatists was held near the town in 1772. In the neighbourhood
the Turks suffered a severe defeat from the Austrians and
Russians in 1789.



FOCUS (Latin for &ldquo;hearth&rdquo; or &ldquo;fireplace&rdquo;), a point at which
converging rays meet, toward which they are directed, or from
which diverging rays are directed; in the latter case called
the virtual focus (see Microscope; Telescope; Lens). In
geometry the word is used to denote certain points (see
Geometry; Conic Section; and Perspective).



FOG, the name given to any distribution of solid or liquid
particles in the surface layers of the atmosphere which renders
surrounding objects notably indistinct or altogether invisible
according to their distance. In its more intense forms it hinders
and delays travellers of all kinds, by sea or land, by railway, road
or river, or by the mountain path. It is sometimes so thick as
to paralyse traffic altogether. According to the New English
Dictionary the word &ldquo;appears to be&rdquo; a back formation from
the adjective &ldquo;foggy,&rdquo; a derivative of &ldquo;fog&rdquo; used with its old
meaning of aftermath or coarse grass, or, in the north of Britain,
of &ldquo;moss.&rdquo; Such a formation would be reasonable, because
wreaths of fog in the atmospheric sense are specially characteristic
of meadows and marshes where fog, in the more ancient
sense, grows.

Two other words, mist and haze, are also in common use with
reference to the deterioration of transparency of the surface
layers of the atmosphere caused by solid or liquid particles, and
in ordinary literature the three words are used almost according
to the fancy of the writer. It seems possible to draw a distinction
between mist and haze that would be fairly well supported by
usage. Mist may be defined as a cloud of water particles at the
surface of land or sea, and would only occur when the air is nearly
or actually saturated, that is, when there is little or no difference
between the readings of the dry and wet bulbs; the word haze,
on the other hand, may be reserved for the obscuration of the
surface layers of the atmosphere when the air is dry.

It would not be difficult to quote instances in which even this
distinction is disregarded in practice. Indeed, the telegraphic
code of the British Meteorological Office uses the same figure for
mist and haze, and formerly the Beaufort weather notation had
no separate letter for haze (now indicated by z), though it
588
distinguished between
f, fog, and m, mist. It is
possible, however, that
these practices may
arise, not from confusion
of idea, but from
economy of symbols,
when the meaning can
be made out from a
knowledge of the associated
observations.

As regards the distinction
between mist
and fog, careful consideration
of a number
of examples leads to the conclusion that the word &ldquo;fog&rdquo; is
used to indicate not so much the origin or meteorological
nature of the obscurity as its effect upon traffic and travellers
whether on land or sea. It is, generally speaking, &ldquo;in a
fog&rdquo; that a traveller loses himself, and indeed the phrase
has become proverbial in that sense. A &ldquo;fog-bell&rdquo; or &ldquo;fog-horn&rdquo;
is sounded when the atmosphere is so thick that the aid of
sound is required for navigation. A vessel is &ldquo;fog-logged&rdquo;
or &ldquo;fog-bound&rdquo; when it is stopped or detained on account of
thick atmosphere. A &ldquo;fog-signal&rdquo; is employed on railways
when the ordinary signals are obliterated within working
distances. A &ldquo;fog-bow&rdquo; is the accompaniment of conditions
when a mountain traveller is apt to lose his way.

These words are used quite irrespective of the nature of the
cloud which interferes with effective vision and necessitates the
special provision; the word &ldquo;mist&rdquo; is seldom used in similar
connexion. We may thus define a fog as a surface cloud sufficiently
thick to cause hindrance to traffic. It will be a thick mist
if the cloud consists of water particles, a thick haze if it consists
of smoke or dust particles which would be persistent even in a
dry atmosphere.

It is probable that sailors would be inclined to restrict the use
of the word to the surface clouds met with in comparatively calm
weather, and that the obscurity of the atmosphere
when it is blowing hard and perhaps raining hard
as well should be indicated by the terms &ldquo;thick
weather&rdquo; or &ldquo;very thick weather&rdquo; and not by
&ldquo;fog&rdquo;; but the term &ldquo;fog&rdquo; would be quite correctly
used on such occasions from the point of view of
cautious navigation. If cloud, drizzling rain, or
heavy rain cause such obscurity that passing ships
are not visible within working distances the sounding
of a fog-horn becomes a duty.

The number of occasions upon which fog and
mist may be noted as occurring with winds of different strengths
may be exemplified by the following results of thirty years for
St Mary&rsquo;s, Scilly Isles, where the observations have always
been made by men of nautical experience.

Number of occasions of mist per 1000 observations 5 6 11 22 20 12 6 2 84


The use of the word &ldquo;fog&rdquo; in the connexion &ldquo;high fog,&rdquo;
to describe the almost total darkness in the daytime occasionally
noted in London and other large cities due to the persistent
opaque cloud in the upper air without serious obscuration of the
surface layers, is convenient but incorrect.

Regarding &ldquo;fog&rdquo; as a word used to indicate the state of the
atmosphere as regards transparency considered with reference to
its effect upon traffic, a scale of fog intensity has been introduced
for use on land or at sea, whereby the intensity of obscurity is
indicated by the numbers 1 to 5 in the table following. At
sea or in the country a fog, as a rule, is white and consists of
a cloud of minute water globules, of no great vertical thickness,
which disperses the sunlight by repeated reflection but is fully
translucent. In dust-storms and sand-storms dark or coloured
fog clouds are produced such as those which are met with in the
Harmattan winds off the west coast of Africa. In large towns
the fog cloud is darkened and intensified by smoke, and in some
cases may be regarded as due entirely to the smoke.

The physical processes which produce fogs of water particles
are complicated and difficult to unravel. We have to account
for the formation and maintenance of a cloud at the earth&rsquo;s
surface; and the process of cloud-formation which is probably
most usual in nature, namely, the cooling of air by rarefaction
due to the reduction of pressure on ascent, cannot be invoked,
except in the case of the fogs forming the cloud-caps of hills,
which are perhaps not fairly included. We have to fall back upon
the only other process hitherto recognized as causing cloudy
condensation in the atmosphere, that is to say, the mixing of
masses of mist air of different temperatures. The mixing is
brought about by the slow motion of air masses, and this slow
motion is probably essential to the phenomenon.

Over the sea fog is most frequently due to the cooling of a
surface layer of warm air by the underlying cold water. The
amount of motion of the air must be sufficient to prevent the
condensation taking place at the sea surface without showing
itself as a cloud. In a research on the Life History of Surface Air
Currents the changes incidental to the movement of the air over
the north Atlantic Ocean were traced with great care, and the
above examples (Tables I, II) taken from page 72
of the work referred to are typical of the formation
of sea fog by the cooling of a relatively warm
current passing over cold water.

In conformity with this suggestion we find that
fog is most liable to occur over the open ocean
in those regions where, as off the Newfoundland
banks, cold-water currents underlie warm
air, and that it is most frequent at the season of the year when the
air temperature is increasing faster than the water temperature.
But it is difficult to bring this hypothesis always to bear upon
actual practice, because the fog is representative of a temperature
difference which has ceased to exist. One cannot therefore
observe under ordinary circumstances both the temperature
difference and the fog. Doubtless one requires not only the
initial temperature difference but also the slow drift of air which
favours cooling of the lower layers without too much mixing and
consequently a layer of fog close to the surface. Such a fog,
the characteristic sea fog, may be called a cold surface fog. From
589
the conditions of its formation it is likely to be less dense at the
mast-head than it is on deck.

One would expect that a cold-air current passing over a warm
sea surface would give rise to an ascending current of warmed air
and hence cause cumulus cloud and possibly thunder showers
rather than surface fog, but one cannot resist the conclusion that
sea fog is sometimes formed by slow transference of cold air over
relatively warm water, giving rise to what may be called a
&ldquo;steaming-pot&rdquo; fog. In such a case the actual surface layer in
contact with the warm water would be clear, and the fog would
be thicker aloft where the mixing of cold air and water vapour
is more complete. Such fogs are, however, probably rare in
comparison with the cold-water fogs. If the existence of a cold
current over warm water were a sufficient cause of fog, as a current
of warm air over cold water appears to be, the geographical
distribution of notable fog would be much more widespread than
it actually is, and the seasonal distribution of fog would also be
other than it is.

The formation of fog over land seems to be an even more
complicated process than over the sea. Certainly in some cases
mistiness amounting to fog arises from the replacement of cold
surface air which has chilled the earth and the objects thereon
by a warm current. But this process can hardly give rise to
detached masses or banks of fog. The ordinary land or valley
fog of the autumn evening or winter morning is due to the combination
of three causes, first the cooling of the surface layer of
air at or after sunset by the radiation of the earth, or more
particularly of blades of grass, secondly the slow downward flow
(in the absence of wind) of the air thus cooled towards lower
levels following roughly the course of the natural water drainage
of the land, and thirdly the supply of moisture by evaporation
from warm moist soil or from the relatively warm water surface
of river or lake. In this way steaming-pot fog gradually forms
and is carried downward by the natural though slow descent of
the cooled air. It thus forms in wreaths and banks in the lowest
parts, until perhaps the whole valley becomes filled with a cloud
of mist or fog. A case of this kind in the Lake District is minutely
described by J.B. Cohen (Q.J. Roy. Met. Soc. vol. 30, p. 211,
1904).

It will be noticed that upon this hypothesis the circumstances
favourable for fog formation are (1) a site near the bottom level of
the drainage area, (2) cold surface air and no wind, (3) an evening
or night of vigorous radiation, (4) warm soil, and (5) abundant
moisture in the surface-soil. These conditions define with
reasonable accuracy the circumstances in which fog is actually
observed.

The persistence of these fog wreaths is always remarkable
when one considers that the particles of a fog cloud, however
small they may be, must be continually sinking through the air
which holds them, and that unless some upward motion of the
air keeps at least a balance against this downward fall, the
particles of the cloud must reach the earth or water and to that
extent the cloud must disappear. In sheltered valleys it is easy
to suppose that the constant downward drainage of fresh and
colder fog-laden material at the surface supplies to the layers displaced
from the bottom the necessary upward motion, and the
result of the gradual falling of drops is only that the surface
cloud gets thicker; but there are occasions when the extent and
persistence of land fog seems too great to be accounted for by
persistent radiation cooling. For example, in the week before
Christmas of 1904 the whole of England south of the Humber
was covered with fog for several days. It is of course possible
that so much fog-laden air was poured down from the sides of
mountains and hills that did project above the surface of the fog,
as to keep the lower reaches supplied for the whole time, but
without more particulars such a statement seems almost incredible.
Moreover, the drifting of fog banks over the sea seems
capricious and unrelated to any known circumstances of fog-formation,
so that one is tempted to invoke the aid of electrification
of the particles or some other abnormal condition to account
for the persistence of fog. The observations at Kew observatory
show that the electrical potential is abnormally high during fog,
but whether that is the cause or the result of the presence of the
water particles, we are not yet in a position to say. It must be
remembered that a fog cloud ought to be regarded as being,
generally speaking, in process of formation by mixing. Observations
upon clouds formed experimentally in globes tend to show
that if a mass of fog-bearing air could be enclosed and kept still
for only a short while the fog would settle and leave the air clear.
The apparently capricious behaviour of fog banks may be due
to the fact that mixing is still going on in the persistent ones,
but is completed in the disappearing ones.

One remarkable characteristic of a persistent fog is the coldness
of the foggy air at the surface in spite of the heat of the sun&rsquo;s
rays falling upon the upper surface of the fog. A remarkable
example may be quoted from the case of London, which was under
fog all day on 28th January 1909. The maximum temperature
only reached 31Â° F., whereas at Warlingham in Surrey from which
the fog lifted it was as high as 46Â° F.

A priori we might suppose that the formation of fog would
arrest cooling by radiation, and that fog would thus act as a
protection of plants against frost. The condensation of water
evaporated from wet ground, which affords the material for making
fog, does apparently act as a protection, and heavy watering is
sometimes used to protect plants from frost, but the same cannot
be said of fog itself&mdash;cooling appears to go on in spite of the formation
of fog.

A third process of fog-formation, namely, the descent of a
cloud from above in the form of light drizzling rain, hardly calls
for remark. In so far as it is subject to rules, they are the rules
of clouds and rain and are therefore independent of surface
conditions.

These various causes of fog-formation maybe considered with
advantage in relation to the geographical distribution of fog.
Statistics on this subject are not very satisfactory on account of
the uncertainty of the distinction between fog and mist, but a
good deal may be learned from the distribution of fog over the
north Atlantic Ocean and its various coasts as shown in the
Monthly Meteorological Charts of the north Atlantic issued by
the Meteorological Office, and the Pilot charts of the North
Atlantic of the United States Hydrographic Office. Coast fog,
which is probably of the same nature as land fog, is most frequent
in the winter months, whereas sea fog and ocean fog is most
extensive and frequent in the spring and summer. By June the
fog area has extended from the Great Banks over the ocean to
the British Isles, in July it is most intense, and by August it has
notably diminished, while in November, which is proverbially a
foggy month on land, there is hardly any fog shown over the
ocean.

The various meteorological aspects of fog and its incidence in
London were the subject of reports to the Meteorological Council
by Captain A. Carpenter and Mr R.G.K. Lempfert, based upon
special observations made in the winters of 1901-1902 and 1902-1903
in order to examine the possibility of more precise forecasts
of fog.

The study of the properties and behaviour of fog is especially
important for large towns in consequence of the economic and
hygienic results which follow the incidence of dense fogs. The
fogs of London in particular have long been a subject of inquiry.
It is difficult to get trustworthy statistics on the subject in consequence
of the vagueness of the practice as regards the classification
of fog. For large towns there is great advantage in using a
fog scale such as that given above, in which one deals only with
the practical range of vision irrespective of the meteorological
cause.

Accepting the classification which distinguishes between fog
and haze or mist, but not between the two latter terms, as
equivalent to specifying fog when the thickness amounts to the
figure 2 or more on the fog scale, we are enabled to compare the
frequency of fog in London by the comparison of the results at
the London observing stations. The comparison was made by
Mr Brodie in a paper read before the Royal Meteorological Society
(Quarterly Journal, vol. 31, p. 15), and it appears therefrom
that in recent years there has been a notable diminution of fog
590
frequency, as indicated in the following table of the total number
of days of fog in the years from 1871:&mdash;

But from any statistics of the frequency occurrence of fog
it must not be understood that the atmosphere of London is
approaching that of the surrounding districts as regards transparency.
Judged by the autographic records it is still almost
opaque to sunshine strong enough to burn the card of the
recorder during the winter months.


The bibliography of fog is very extensive. The titles referring to

FOGAZZARO, ANTONIO (1842-&emsp;&emsp;), Italian novelist and
poet, was born at Vicenza in 1842. He was a pupil of the Abate
Zanella, one of the best of the modern Italian poets, whose
tender, thoughtful and deeply religious spirit continued to
animate his literary productions. He began his literary career
with Miranda, a poetical romance (1874), followed in 1876
by Valsolda, which, republished in 1886 with considerable additions,
constitutes perhaps his principal claim as a poet, which
is not inconsiderable. To the classic grandeur of Carducci and
D&rsquo;Annunzio&rsquo;s impetuous torrent of melody Fogazzaro opposes
a Wordsworthian simplicity and pathos, contributing to modern
Italian literature wholesome elements of which it would otherwise
be nearly destitute. His novels, Malombra (1882), Daniele
Cortis (1887), Misterio del Poeta (1888), obtained considerable
literary success upon their first publication, but did not gain
universal popularity until they were discovered and taken up by
French critics in 1896. The demand then became prodigious,
and a new work, Piccolo Mondo antico (1896), which critics far
from friendly to Fogazzaro&rsquo;s religious and philosophical ideas
pronounced the best Italian novel since I Promessi Sposi, went
through numerous editions. Even greater sensation was caused
by his novel Il Santo (The Saint, 1906), on account of its being
treated as unorthodox by the Vatican; and Fogazzaro&rsquo;s sympathy
with the Liberal Catholic movement&mdash;his own Catholicism
being well known&mdash;made this novel a centre of discussion in the
Roman Catholic world.

FOGELBERG, BENEDICT (or Bengt) ERLAND (1786-1854),
Swedish sculptor, was born at Gothenburg on the 8th of August
1786. His father, a copper-founder, encouraging an early-exhibited
taste for design, sent him in 1801 to Stockholm, where
he studied at the school of art. There he came much under the
influence of the sculptor Sergell, who communicated to him his
own enthusiasm for antique art and natural grace. Fogelberg
worked hard at Stockholm for many years, although his instinct
for severe beauty rebelled against the somewhat rococo quality
of the art then prevalent in the city. In 1818 the grant of a
government pension enabled him to travel. He studied from
one to two years in Paris, first under Pierre GuÃ©rin, and afterwards
under the sculptor Bosio, for the technical practice of
sculpture. In 1820 Fogelberg realized a dream of his life in
visiting Rome, where the greater part of his remaining years
were spent in the assiduous practice of his art, and the careful
study and analysis of the works of the past. Visiting his native
country by royal command in 1854, he was received with great
enthusiasm, but nothing could compensate him for the absence
of those remains of antiquity and surroundings of free natural
beauty to which he had been so long accustomed. Returning
to Italy, he died suddenly of apoplexy at Trieste on the 22nd
of December 1854. The subjects of Fogelberg&rsquo;s earlier works
are mostly taken
from classic mythology.
Of these,
&ldquo;Cupid and
Psyche,&rdquo; &ldquo;Venus
entering the
Bath,&rdquo; &ldquo;A
Bather&rdquo; (1838),
&ldquo;Apollo Citharede,&rdquo; &ldquo;Venus and Cupid&rdquo; (1839) and &ldquo;Psyche&rdquo;
(1854) may be mentioned. In his representations of Scandinavian
mythology Fogelberg showed, perhaps for the first time, that he
had powers above those of intelligent assimilation and imitation.
His &ldquo;Odin&rdquo; (1831), &ldquo;Thor&rdquo; (1842), and &ldquo;Balder&rdquo; (1842), though influenced
by Greek art, display considerable power of independent
imagination. His portraits and historical figures, as those of
Gustavus Adolphus (1849), of Charles XII. (1851), of Charles XIII.
(1852), and of Birger Jarl, the founder of Stockholm (1853),
are faithful and dignified works.

FOGGIA, a town and episcopal see (since 1855) of Apulia, Italy,
the capital of the province of Foggia, situated 243 ft. above sea-level,
in the centre of the great Apulian plain, 201 m. by rail S.E.
of Ancona and 123 m. N.E. by E. of Naples. Pop. (1901) town,
49,031; commune, 53,134. The name is probably derived from
the pits or cellars (foveae) in which the inhabitants store their
grain. The town is the medieval successor of the ancient Arpi,
3 m. to the N.; the Normans, after conquering the district from
the Eastern empire, gave it its first importance. The date of the
erection of the cathedral is probably about 1179; it retains some
traces of Norman architecture, and the faÃ§ade has a fine figured
cornice by Bartolommeo da Foggia; the crypt has capitals of
the 11th (?) century. The whole church was, however, much
altered after the earthquake of 1731. A gateway of the palace
of the emperor Frederick II. (1223, by Bartolommeo da Foggia)
is also preserved. Here died his third wife, Isabella, daughter
of King John of England. Charles of Anjou died here in 1284.
After his son&rsquo;s death, it was a prey to internal dissensions and
finally came under Alphonso I. of Aragon, who converted the
pastures of the Apulian plain into a royal domain in 1445, and
made Foggia the place at which the tax on the sheep was to be
paid and the wool to be sold. The other buildings of the town
are modern. Foggia is a commercial centre of some importance
for the produce of the surrounding country, and is also a considerable
railway centre, being situated on the main line from
Bologna to Brindisi, at the point where this is joined by the line
from Benevento and Caserta. There are also branches to
Rocchetta S. Antonio (and thence to either Avellino, Potenza,
or Gioia del Colle), to Manfredonia, and to Lucera.



FÃ–HN (Ger., probably derived through Romansch favongn,
favoign, from Lat. favonius), a warm dry wind blowing down the
valleys of the Alps from high central regions, most frequently
in winter. The FÃ¶hn wind often blows with great violence.
It is caused by the indraft of air from the elevated region to
areas of low barometric pressure in the neighbourhood, and the
warmth and dryness are due to dynamical compression of the
air as it descends to lower levels. Similar local winds occur
in many parts of the world, as Greenland, and on the slopes of the
Rocky Mountains. In the southern Alpine valleys the FÃ¶hn
wind is often called sirocco, but its nature and cause are different
from the true sirocco. The belief that the warm dry wind comes
from the Sahara dies hard; and still finds expression in some
textbooks.


For a full account of these winds see Hann, Lehrbuch der Meteorologie,
p. 594.




FÃ–HR, a German island in the North Sea, belonging to
the province of Schleswig-Holstein, and situated off its coast.
Pop. 4500. It comprises an area of 32 sq. m., and is reached by
a regular steamboat service from Husum and DagebÃ¼ll on the
mainland to Wyk, the principal bathing resort on the E. coast of
the island. The chief attraction of Wyk is the Sandwall, a
591
promenade which is shaded by trees and skirts the beach. FÃ¶hr,
the most fertile of the North Frisian islands, is principally
marshland, and comparatively well wooded. There are numerous
pleasantly-situated villages and hamlets scattered over it, of
which the most frequented are Boldixum, Nieblum and Alkersum.
The inhabitants are mainly engaged in the fishing
industry, and are known as excellent sailors.



FOIL. 1. (Through O. Fr. from Lat. folium, a leaf, modern
Fr. feuille), a leaf, and so used in heraldry and in plant names,
such as the &ldquo;trefoil&rdquo; clover; and hence applied to anything resembling
a leaf. In architecture, the word appears for the small
leaf-like spaces formed by the cusps of tracery in windows or
panels, and known, according to the number of such spaces, as
&ldquo;quatrefoil,&rdquo; &ldquo;cinquefoil,&rdquo; &amp;c. The word is also found in
&ldquo;counterfoil,&rdquo; a leaf of a receipt or cheque book, containing
memoranda or a duplicate of the receipt or draft, kept by the
receiver or drawer as a &ldquo;counter&rdquo; or check. &ldquo;Foil&rdquo; is particularly
used of thin plates of metal, resembling a leaf, not in shape
as much as in thinness. In thickness foil comes between &ldquo;leaf&rdquo;
and &ldquo;sheet&rdquo; metal. In jewelry, a foil of silvered sheet copper,
sometimes known as Dutch foil, is used as a backing for paste
gems, or stones of inferior lustre or colour. This is coated with
a mixture of isinglass and translucent colour, varying with the
stones to be backed, or, if only brilliancy is required, left uncoloured,
but highly polished. From this use of &ldquo;foil,&rdquo; the
word comes to mean, in a figurative sense, something which by
contrast, or by its own brightness, serves to heighten the attractive
qualities of something else placed in juxtaposition. The
commonest &ldquo;foil&rdquo; is that generally known as &ldquo;tinfoil.&rdquo; The
ordinary commercial &ldquo;tinfoil&rdquo; usually consists chiefly of lead,
and is used for the wrapping of chocolate or other sweetmeats,
tobacco or cigarettes. A Japanese variegated foil gives the
effect of &ldquo;damaskeening.&rdquo; A large number of thin plates of
various metals, gold, silver, copper, together with alloys of
different metals are soldered together in a particular order,
a pattern is hammered into the soldered edges, and the whole is
hammered or rolled into a single thin plate, the pattern then
appearing in the order in which the various metals were placed.

2. (From an O. Fr. fuler or foler, modern fouler, to tread or
trample, to &ldquo;full&rdquo; cloth, Lat. fullo, a fuller), an old hunting
term, used of the running back of an animal over its own tracks,
to confuse the scent and baffle the hounds. It is also used in
wrestling, of a &ldquo;throw.&rdquo; Thus comes the common use of the
word, in a figurative sense, with reference to both these meanings,
of baffling or defeating an adversary, or of parrying an attack.

3. As the name of the weapon used in fencing (see Foil-Fencing)
the word is of doubtful origin. One suggestion, based
on a supposed similar use of Fr. fleuret, literally a &ldquo;little flower,&rdquo;
for the weapon, is that foil means a leaf, and must be referred
in origin to Lat. folium. A second suggestion is that it means
&ldquo;blunted,&rdquo; and is the same as (2). A third is that it is an
adaptation of an expression &ldquo;at foils,&rdquo; i.e. &ldquo;parrying.&rdquo; Of
these suggestions, according to the New English Dictionary, the
first has nothing to support it, the second is not supported by
any evidence that in sense (2) the word ever meant to blunt.
The third has some support. Finally a suggestion is made that
the word is an alteration of an old word &ldquo;foin,&rdquo; meaning a
thrust with a pointed weapon. The origin of this word is
probably an O. Fr. foisne, from the Lat. fuscina, a three-pronged
fork.



FOIL-FENCING, the art of attack and defence with the fencing-foil.
The word is used in several spellings (foyle, file, &amp;c.) by the
English writers of the last half of the 16th century, but less in
the sense of a weapon of defence than merely as an imitation of
a real weapon. Blunt swords for practice in fencing have been
used in all ages. For the most part these were of wood and flat in
general form, but when, towards the close of the 17th century, all
cutting action with the small-sword was discarded (see Fencing),
foil-blades were usually made of steel, and either round, three-cornered
or four-cornered in form, with a button covering the
point. The foil is called in French fleuret, and in Italian
fioretto (literally &ldquo;bud&rdquo;) from this button. The classic small-sword
play of the 17th and 18th centuries is represented at the
present time by fencing with the Ã©pÃ©e de combat (fighting-rapier),
which is merely the modern duelling-sword furnished with a
button (see Ã‰pÃ©e-de-Combat), and by foil-fencing. Foil-fencing
is a conventional art, its characteristic limitation lying in the rule
that no hits except those on the body shall be considered good,
and not even those unless they be given in strict accordance with
certain standard precepts. In Ã©pÃ©e-fencing on the contrary,
a touch on any part of the person, however given, is valid.
Foil-fencing is considered the basis, so far as practice is concerned,
of all sword-play, whether with foil, Ã©pÃ©e or sabre.

There are two recognized schools of foil-fencing, the French and
the Italian. The French method, which is now generally adopted
everywhere except in Italy, is described in this article, reference
being made to the important differences between the two schools.

The Foil.&mdash;The foil consists of the &ldquo;blade&rdquo; and the &ldquo;handle.&rdquo;
The blade, which is of steel and has a quadrangular section,
consists of two parts: the blade proper, extending from the guard
to the button, and the &ldquo;tongue,&rdquo; which runs through the handle
and is joined to the pommel. The blade proper is divided into
the &ldquo;forte,&rdquo; or thicker half (next the handle), and the &ldquo;foible&rdquo;
or thinner half. Some authorities divide the blade proper into
three parts, the &ldquo;forte,&rdquo; &ldquo;middle&rdquo; and &ldquo;foible.&rdquo; The handle
is comprised of the &ldquo;guard,&rdquo; the &ldquo;grip&rdquo; and the &ldquo;pommel.&rdquo;
The guard is a light piece of metal shaped like the figure 8 (Fr.
lunettes, spectacles) and backed with a piece of stiff leather of
the same shape. The grip, which is grasped by the hand, is a
hollow piece of wood, usually wound with twine, through which
the tongue of the blade passes. The pommel is a piece of metal,
usually pear-shaped, to which the end of the tongue is joined and
which forms the extremity of the handle. The blade from guard
to button is about 33 in. long (No. 5), though a somewhat shorter
and lighter blade is generally used by ladies. The handle is
about 8 in. long and slightly curved downwards.

The genuine Italian foil differs from the French in having the
blade a trifle longer and more whippy, and in the form of the
handle, which consists of a thin, solid, bell-shaped guard from
4 to 5 in. in diameter, a straight grip and a light metal bar joining
the grip with the guard, beyond the edge of which it extends
slightly on each side. Of late years many Italian masters use
French blades and even discard the cross-bar, retaining, however,
the bell-guard.

In holding the foil, the thumb is placed on the top or convex
surface of the grip (the sides of which are a trifle narrower than
the top and bottom), while the palm and fingers grasp the other
three sides. This is the position of &ldquo;supination,&rdquo; or thumb-up.
&ldquo;Pronation&rdquo; is the reverse position, with the knuckles up.
The French lay stress upon holding the foil lightly, the necessary
pressure being exerted mostly by the thumb and forefinger, the
other fingers being used more to guide the direction of the executed
movements. This is in order to give free scope to the
doigtÃ© (fingering), or the faculty of directing the point of the foil
by the action of the fingers alone, and includes the possibility
of changing the position of the hand on the grip. Thus, in parrying,
the end of the thumb is placed within half an inch, or even
less, of the guard, while in making a lunge, the foil is held as near
the pommel as possible, in order to gain additional length.
It will be seen that doigtÃ© is impossible with the Italian foil,
in holding which the forefinger is firmly interlaced with the cross-bar,
preventing any movement of the hand. The lightness of
grasp inculcated by the French is illustrated by the rule of the
celebrated master LafaugÃ¨re: &ldquo;Hold your sword as if you had
a little bird in your hand, firmly enough to prevent its escape, yet
not so firmly as to crush it.&rdquo; This lightness has for a consequence
that a disarmament is not considered of any value in the French
school.

To Come on Guard.&mdash;The position of &ldquo;on guard&rdquo; is that in
which the fencer is best prepared both for attack and defence.
It is taken from the position of &ldquo;attention&rdquo;; the feet together
and at right angles with each other, head and body erect, facing
forward in the same direction as the right foot, left arm and hand
hanging in touch with the body, and the right arm and foil
592
forming a straight line so that the button is about 1 yd. in
front of the feet and 4 in. from the floor. From this position the
movements to come &ldquo;on guard&rdquo; are seven in number:&mdash;


1. Raise the arm and foil and extend them towards the adversary
(or master) in a straight line, the hand being opposite the eye.

2. Drop the arm and foil again until the point is about 4 in. from
the floor.

3. Swing the button round so that it shall point horizontally
backwards, and hold the hilt against the left thigh, the open fingers
of the left hand being held, knuckles down, against the guard and
along the blade.

4. Carry the foil, without altering the position of the hands, above
the head until the arms are fully extended, the foil being kept
horizontal and close to the body as it is lifted.

5. Let the left arm fall back behind the head to a curved position,
the hand being opposite the top of the head; at the same time bring
the right hand down opposite the right breast and about 8 in. from
it; keeping the elbow well in and the point of the foil directed
towards the opponent&rsquo;s eye.

6. Bend the legs by separating them at the knees but without
moving the feet.

7. Shift the weight of the body on to the left leg and advance the
right foot a short distance (from 14 to 18 in., according to the height
of the fencer).


In the Italian school the fencer stands on guard with the right
arm fully extended, the body more effaced, i.e. the left shoulder
thrown farther back, and the feet somewhat farther apart. At
the present time, however, many of the best Italian fencers have
adopted the guard with crooked sword-arm, owing to their
abandonment of the old long-foil blade.

The Recover (at the close of the lesson or assault).&mdash;To recover
&ldquo;in advance&rdquo;: extend the right arm at right angles with the
body, drop the left arm and straighten the legs by drawing the
rear foot up to the one in advance. To recover &ldquo;to the rear&rdquo;:
extend the right arm and drop the left as before, and straighten
the legs by drawing the forward foot back to that in the rear.

The Salute always follows the recover, the two really forming
one man&oelig;uvre. Having recovered, carry the right hand to a
position just in front of the throat, knuckles out, foil vertical
with point upwards; then lower and extend the arm with nails
up until the point is 4 in. from the floor and slightly to the right.

To Advance.&mdash;Being on guard, take a short step forward with
the right foot and let the left foot follow immediately the same
distance, the position of the body not being changed. However
the step, or series of steps, is made, the right foot should always
move first.

To Retreat.&mdash;This is the reverse of the advance, the left foot
always moving first.

The Calls (deux appels).&mdash;Being on guard, tap the floor twice
with the right foot without altering the position of any other
part of the person. The object of the calls is to test the
equilibrium of the body, and they are usually executed as a preliminary
to the recover.

The Lunge is the chief means of attack. It is immediately
preceded by the movement of &ldquo;extension,&rdquo; in fact the two
really form one combined movement. Extension is executed by
quickly extending the right arm, so that point, hand and shoulder
shall have the same elevation; no other part of the person is
moved. The &ldquo;lunge&rdquo; is then carried out by straightening the
left leg and throwing forward the right foot, so that it shall
be planted as far forward as possible without losing the equilibrium
or preventing a quick recovery to the position of guard.
The left foot remains firmly in its position, the right shoulder is
advanced, and the left arm is thrown down and back (with hand
open and thumb up), to balance the body. The recovery to the
position of guard is accomplished by smartly throwing the body
back by the exertion of the right leg, until its weight rests again
on the left leg, the right foot and arms resuming their on-guard
positions. The point upon which the French school lays most
stress is, that the movement of extension shall, if only by a
fraction of a second, actually precede the advance of the right
foot. The object of this is to ensure the accuracy of the lunge,
i.e. the direction of the point.

The Gain.&mdash;This consists in bringing up the left foot towards
the right (the balance being shifted), keeping the knees bent. In
this manner a step is gained and an exceptionally long lunge can
be made without the knowledge of the adversary. It is a common
stratagem of fencers whose reach is short.

Defence.&mdash;For the purpose of nomenclature the space on the
fencer&rsquo;s jacket within which hits count is divided into quarters,
the two upper ones being called the &ldquo;high lines,&rdquo; and the two
lower ones the &ldquo;low lines.&rdquo; Thus a thrust directed at the upper
part of the breast is called an attack in the high lines. In like
manner the parries are named from the different quarters they
are designed to protect. There are four traditional parries
executed with the hand in supination, and four others, practically
identical in execution, made with the hand held in pronation.
Thus the parries defending the upper right-hand quarter of the
jacket are &ldquo;sixte&rdquo; (sixth; with the hand in supination) and
&ldquo;tierce&rdquo; (third; hand in pronation). Those defending the
upper left-hand quarter are &ldquo;quarte&rdquo; (fourth; in supination)
and &ldquo;quinte&rdquo; (fifth; in pronation). Those defending the lower
right-hand quarter are &ldquo;octave&rdquo; (eighth; in supination) and
&ldquo;seconde&rdquo; (second; in pronation). Those defending the lower
left-hand quarter are &ldquo;septime&rdquo; (seventh; in supination),
more generally called &ldquo;demicircle,&rdquo; or &ldquo;half-circle&rdquo;; and
&ldquo;prime&rdquo; (first; in pronation).

The Parries.&mdash;The tendency of the French school has always
been towards simplicity, especially of defence, and at the present
day the parries made with the knuckles up (pronation), although
recognized and taught, are seldom if ever used against a strong
adversary in foil-fencing, owing principally to the time lost in
turning the hand. The theory of parrying is to turn aside the
opponent&rsquo;s foil with the least possible expenditure of time and
exertion, using the arm as little as possible while letting the hand
and wrist do the work, and opposing the &ldquo;forte&rdquo; of the foil
to the &ldquo;foible&rdquo; of the adversary&rsquo;s. The foil is kept pointed
as directly as possible towards the adversary, and the parries are
made rather with the corners than the sides of the blade. The
slightest movement that will turn aside the opponent&rsquo;s blade is
the most perfect parry. There are two kinds of parries, &ldquo;simple,&rdquo;
in which the attack is warded off by a single movement, and
&ldquo;counter,&rdquo; in which a narrow circle is described by the point of
the foil round that of the opponent, which is thus enveloped and
thrown aside. There are also complex parries, composed of
combinations of two or more parries, which are used to meet
complicated attacks, but they are all resolvable into simple
parries. In parrying, the arm is bent about at right angles.

Simple Parries.&mdash;The origin of the numerical nomenclature of
the parries is a matter of dispute, but it is generally believed that
they received their names from the positions assumed in the process
of drawing the sword and falling on guard. Thus the position
of the hand and blade, the moment it is drawn from the scabbard
on the left side, is practically that of the first, or &ldquo;prime,&rdquo; parry.
To go from &ldquo;prime&rdquo; to &ldquo;seconde&rdquo; it is only necessary to drop
the hand and carry it across the body to the left side; thence
to &ldquo;tierce&rdquo; is only a matter of raising the point of the sword, &amp;c.

Parry of Prime (to ward off attacks on the&mdash;usually lower&mdash;left-hand
side of the body). Hold the hand, knuckles up, opposite
the left eye and the point directed towards the opponent&rsquo;s knee.
This parry is now regarded more as an elegant evolution than a
sound means of defence, and is little employed.

Parry of Seconde (against thrusts at the lower right-hand side).
This is executed by a quick, not too wide movement of the hand
downwards and slightly to the right, knuckles up.

Parry of Tierce (against thrusts at the upper right-hand side).
A quick, dry beat on the adversary&rsquo;s &ldquo;foible&rdquo; is given, forcing
it to the right, the hand, in pronation, being held opposite the
middle of the right breast. This parry has been practically
discarded in favour of &ldquo;sixte.&rdquo;

Parry of Quarte (against thrusts at the upper left-hand side).
This parry, perhaps the most used of all, is executed by forcing
the adversary&rsquo;s blade to the left by a dry beat, the hand being in
supination, opposite the left breast.

Parry of Quinte (against thrusts at the left-hand side, like
&ldquo;quarte&rdquo;). This is practically a low &ldquo;quarte,&rdquo; and is little
used.

593

Parry of Sixte (against thrusts at the upper right-hand side).
This parry is, together with &ldquo;quarte,&rdquo; the most important of all.
It is executed with the hand held in supination opposite the right
breast, a quick, narrow movement throwing the adversary&rsquo;s
blade to the right.

Parry of Septime or Half-Circle (against thrusts at the lower
left-hand side) is executed by describing with the point of the
foil a small semicircle downward and towards the left, the hand
moving a few inches in the same direction, but kept thumb up.

Parry of Octave (against thrusts at the lower right-hand side)
is executed by describing with the point of the foil a small semicircle
downward and towards the right, the hand moving a few
inches in the same direction, but kept thumb up.

Counter Parries (Fr. contre).&mdash;Although the simple parries
are theoretically sufficient for defence, they are so easily deceived
by feints that they are supplemented by counter parries, in
which the blade describes narrow circles, following that of the
adversary and meeting and turning it aside; thus the point
describes a complete circle while the hand remains practically
stationary. Each simple parry has its counter, made with the
hand in the same position and on the same side as in the simple
parry. The two most important are the &ldquo;counter of quarte&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;counter of sixte,&rdquo; while the counters of &ldquo;septime&rdquo;
and &ldquo;octave&rdquo; are less used, and the other four at the present
time practically never.

Counter of Quarte.&mdash;Being on guard in quarte (with your
adversary&rsquo;s blade on the left of yours), if he drops his point under
and thrusts in sixte, in other words at your right breast, describe
a narrow circle with your point round his blade, downward to the
right and then up over to the left, bringing hand and foil back to
their previous positions and catching and turning aside his blade
on the way. The &ldquo;Counter of Sixte&rdquo; is executed in a similar
manner, but the circle is described in the opposite direction,
throwing off the adverse blade to the right. The &ldquo;Counters of
Septime and Octave&rdquo; are similar to the other two but are
executed in the low lines.

Complex or Combined Parries are such as are composed of two
or more parries executed in immediate succession, and are made
in answer to feint attacks by the adversary (see below); e.g.
being on guard in quarte, should the adversary drop his point
under and feint at the right breast but deflect the point again
and really thrust on the left, it is evident that the simple parry
of sixte would cover the right breast but would leave the real
point of attack, the left, entirely uncovered. The sixte parry
is therefore followed, as a continuation of the movement, by the
parry of quarte, or a counter parry. The complex parries are
numerous and depend upon the attack to be met.

Engagement is the junction of the blades, the different engagements
being named from the parries. Thus, if both fencers are in
the position of quarte, they are said to be engaged in quarte.
To engage in another line (Change of Engagement) e.g. from
quarte to sixte, the point is lowered and passed under the
adversary&rsquo;s blade, which is pressed slightly outward, so as to be
well covered (called &ldquo;opposition&rdquo;). &ldquo;Double Engagement&rdquo;
is composed of two engagements executed rapidly in succession
in the high lines, the last with opposition.

Attack.&mdash;The attack in fencing comprises all movements the
object of which is to place the point of the foil upon the adversary&rsquo;s
breast, body, sides or back, between collar and belt. The space
upon which hits count is called the &ldquo;target&rdquo; and differs according
to the rules prevailing in the several countries, but is usually
as above stated. In Great Britain no hits above the collar-bones
count, while in America the target is only the left breast between
the median line and a line running from the armpit to the belt.
The reason for this limitation is to encourage accuracy.

Attacks are either &ldquo;primary&rdquo; or &ldquo;secondary.&rdquo; Primary
Attacks are those initiated by a fencer before his adversary has
made any offensive movement, and are divided into &ldquo;Simple,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Feint&rdquo; and &ldquo;Force&rdquo; attacks.

Simple Attacks, the characteristic of which is pace, are those
made with one simple movement only and are four in number,
viz. the &ldquo;Straight Lunge,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Disengagement,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Counter-disengagement&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Cut-over.&rdquo; The Straight-Lunge
(coup droit), used when the adversary is not properly
covered when on guard, is described above under &ldquo;Lunge.&rdquo;
The Disengagement is made by dropping the point of the foil
under the opponent&rsquo;s blade and executing a straight lunge on the
other side. It is often used to take an opponent unawares or
when he presses unduly hard on your blade. The Counter-disengagement
is used when the adversary moves his blade, i.e.
changes the line of engagement, upon which you execute a narrow
circle, avoiding his blade, and thrust in your original line. The
Cut-over (coupÃ©) is a disengagement executed by passing the
point of the foil over that of the adversary and lunging in the
opposite line. The preliminary movement of raising the point
is made by the action of the hand only, the arm not being drawn
back.

Feint Attacks, deceptive in character, are those which are preceded
by one or more feints, or false thrusts made to lure the
adversary into thinking them real ones. A feint is a simple
extension, often with a slight movement of the body, threatening
the adversary in a certain line, for the purpose of inducing him
to parry on that side and thus leave the other open for the real
thrust. At the same time any movement of the blade or any
part of the body tending to deceive the adversary in regard to the
nature of the attack about to follow, must also be considered a
species of feint. The principal feint attacks are the &ldquo;One-Two,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;One-Two-Three&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Double.&rdquo;

The &ldquo;One-Two&rdquo; is a feint in one line, followed (as the
adversary parries) by a thrust in the original line of engagement.
Thus, being engaged in quarte, you drop your point under the
adversary&rsquo;s blade and extend your arm as if to thrust at his left
breast, but instead of doing this, the instant he parries you
move your point back again and lunge in quarte, i.e. on the
side on which you were originally engaged. In feinting it is
necessary that the extension of the arm and blade be so
complete as really to compel the adversary to believe it a
part of a real thrust in that line.

The &ldquo;One-Two-Three&rdquo; consists of two feints, one at each
side, followed by a thrust in the line opposite to that of the
original engagement. Thrusts preceded by three feints are also
sometimes used. It is evident that the above attacks are useless
if the adversary parries by a counter (circular parry), which must
be met by a &ldquo;Double.&rdquo; This is executed by feinting and, upon
perceiving that the adversary opposes with a circular parry, by
following the circle described by his point with a similar circle,
deceiving (i.e. avoiding contact with) his blade and thrusting
home.

The &ldquo;Double,&rdquo; which is a favourite man&oelig;uvre in fencing, is
a combination of a disengagement and a counter-disengagement.

Force-Attacks, the object of which is to disconcert the opponent
by assaulting his blade, are various in character, the principal ones
being the &ldquo;Beat,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Press,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Glide&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Bind.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;Beat&rdquo; is a quick, sharp blow of the forte of the foil upon
the foible of the adversary&rsquo;s, for the purpose of opening a way
for a straight lunge which follows instantly. The blow is made
with the hand only. A &ldquo;false beat&rdquo; is a lighter blow made for
the purpose of drawing out or disconcerting the opponent, and is
often followed by a disengagement. The &ldquo;Press&rdquo; is similar in
character to the beat, but, instead of striking the adverse blade,
a sudden pressure is brought to bear upon it, sufficiently heavy
to force it aside and allow one&rsquo;s own blade to be thrust home. A
&ldquo;false press&rdquo; may be used to entice the adversary into a too
heavy responsive pressure, which may then be taken advantage
of by a disengagement. The &ldquo;Traverse&rdquo; (Fr. froissÃ©, Ital.
striscio) is a prolonged press carried sharply down the adverse
blade towards the handle. The &ldquo;Glide&rdquo; (&ldquo;Graze,&rdquo; Fr. coulÃ©)
is a stealthy sliding of one&rsquo;s blade down that of the adversary,
without his notice, until a straight thrust can be made inside
his guard. It is also used as a feint before a disengage. The
&ldquo;Bind&rdquo; (liement) consists in gaining possession of the adversary&rsquo;s
foible with one&rsquo;s forte, and pressing it down and across
into the opposite low line, when one&rsquo;s own point is thrust home,
the adversary&rsquo;s blade being still held by one&rsquo;s hilt. It may be
594
also carried out from a low line into a high one. The bind is
less used in the French school than in the Italian. The &ldquo;Flanconnade&rdquo;
is a bind made by capturing the adversary&rsquo;s blade
in high quarte, carrying it down and thrusting in the outside
line with strong opposition. Another attack carried out by
means of a twist and thrust is the &ldquo;Cross&rdquo; (croisÃ©), which is
executed when the adversary&rsquo;s blade is held low by passing one&rsquo;s
point over his wrist and forcing down both blades into seconde
with a full extension of the arm. The result is to create a sudden
and wide opening, and often disarms the adversary.

Secondary Attacks are those made (1) just as your adversary
himself starts to attack; (2) during his attack; and (3) on the
completion of his attack if it fails.

1. &ldquo;Attacks on the Preparation&rdquo; are a matter of judgment
and quickness. They are usually attempted when the adversary
is evidently preparing a complicated attack, such as the &ldquo;one-two-three&rdquo;
or some other man&oelig;uvre, involving one or more
preliminary movements. At such a time a quick thrust will
often catch him unawares and score. Opportunities for preparation
attacks are often given when the adversary attempts
a beat preliminary to his thrust; the beat is frustrated by an
&ldquo;absence of the blade,&rdquo; i.e. your blade is made to avoid
contact with his by a narrow movement, and your point
thrust home into the space left unguarded by the force of
his unresisted beat. Or the adversary himself may create an
&ldquo;absence&rdquo; by suddenly interrupting the contact of the blades,
in the hope that, by the removal of the pressure, your blade will
fly off to one side, leaving an opening; if, however, you are prepared
for his &ldquo;absence&rdquo; a straight thrust will score.

2. The chief &ldquo;Attacks on the Development,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Counter
Attacks,&rdquo; are the &ldquo;Stop Thrust&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Time Thrust,&rdquo;
both made while the adversary is carrying out his own attack.
The &ldquo;Stop Thrust&rdquo; (coup d&rsquo;arrÃªt) is one made after the adversary
has actually begun an attack involving two or more movements,
and is only justified when it can be brought off without
your being hit by the attacking adversary&rsquo;s point on any part of
the person. The reason for this is, that the rules of fencing decree
that the fencer attacked must parry, and that, if he disregards this
and attempts a simultaneous counter attack, he must touch his
opponent while totally avoiding the latter&rsquo;s point. Should he,
however, be touched, even on the foot or mask, by the adversary,
his touch, however good, is invalid. If both touches are good,
that of the original attacker only counts. Stop thrusts are
employed mostly against fencers who attack wildly or without
being properly covered. The &ldquo;Time Thrust&rdquo; is delivered with
opposition upon the adversary&rsquo;s composite attack (one involving
several movements), and, if successful, generally parries the
original attack at the same time. It is not valid if the fencer
employing it is touched on any part of the person.

3. &ldquo;Attacks on the Completion&rdquo; (i.e. of the adversary&rsquo;s
attack) are &ldquo;Ripostes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Counter-ripostes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Remises&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Renewals of Attack.&rdquo;

The Riposte (literally, response) is an attack made, immediately
after parrying successfully, by merely straightening the arm,
the body remaining immovable. The &ldquo;counter-riposte&rdquo; is a
riposte made after parrying the adversary&rsquo;s riposte, and generally
from the position of the lunge, or while recovering from it,
since one must have attacked with a full lunge if the adversary
has had an opportunity to deliver a riposte. There are three
kinds of ripostes: direct, with feints and after a pause.

The &ldquo;direct riposte&rdquo; may be made instantly after parrying
the adversary&rsquo;s thrust by quitting his blade and straightening
the arm, so that the point will touch his body on the nearest
and most exposed part; or by not quitting his blade but running
yours quickly down his and at the same time keeping a strong
opposition (&ldquo;riposte d&rsquo;opposition&rdquo;). The quickest direct riposte
is that delivered after parrying quarte (for a right-hand fencer),
and is called by the French the riposte of &ldquo;tac-au-tac,&rdquo; imitative
of the sudden succession of the click of the parry and the tap of
the riposting fencer&rsquo;s point on his adversary&rsquo;s breast. In making
&ldquo;ripostes with a feint&rdquo; the point is not jabbed on to the opponent&rsquo;s
breast immediately after the parry, but one or more
preliminary movements precede the actual riposte, such as a
disengagement, a cut-over or a double.

Ripostes with a pause (Ã  temps perdu, with lost time) are made
after a second&rsquo;s hesitation, and are resorted to when the fencers
are too near for an accurate direct riposte, or to give the
adversary time to make a quick parry, which is then deceived.

The remise is a thrust made after one&rsquo;s first thrust has been
parried and in the same line; it must be made in such a way
that the adversary&rsquo;s justified riposte is at the same time parried
by opposition or completely avoided. It is really a renewal of
the attack in the original line, while the so-called &ldquo;renewal of
attack&rdquo; (&ldquo;redoublement d&rsquo;attaque&rdquo;) is a second thrust which
ignores the adversary&rsquo;s riposte, but made in a different line.
Both the remise and the renewal are valid only when the
adversary&rsquo;s riposte does not hit.

&ldquo;False Attacks&rdquo; are broad movements made for the purpose
of drawing the adversary out or of disconcerting him. They
may consist of an advance, an extension, a change of engagement,
an intentional uncovering by taking a wide guard (called
&ldquo;invitation guard&rdquo;), or any movement or combination of
movements tending to make the adversary believe that a real
attack is under way.

&ldquo;The Assault&rdquo; is a formal fencing bout or series of bouts in
public, while formal fencing in private is called &ldquo;loose play&rdquo;
or a &ldquo;friendly bout.&rdquo; Bouts between fencers take place on a
platform about 24 ft. long and 6 ft. wide (in the United States
20 Ã— 3 ft.). Formal bouts are usually for a number of touches,
or for a certain number of minutes, the fencer who touches
oftenest winning. The judges (usually three or five) are sometimes
empowered to score one or more points against a competitor
for breaches of good form, or for overstepping the space
limits. In the United States bouts are for four minutes, with
a change of places after two minutes, and the competitors are
not interrupted, the winner being indicated by a vote of the
judges, who take into account touches and style. In all countries
contestants are required to wear jackets of a light colour, so
that hits may be easily seen. Audible acknowledgment of all
touches, whether on the target or not, is universally considered
to be a fencer&rsquo;s duty. Fencing competitions are held in Great
Britain under the rules of the Amateur Fencing Association,
and in the United States under those of the Amateur Fencers&rsquo;
League of America.

FOIX, PAUL DE (1528-1584), French prelate and diplomatist.
He studied Greek and Roman literature at Paris, and jurisprudence
at Toulouse, where shortly after finishing his curriculum
he delivered a course of lectures on civil law, which gained
him great reputation. At the age of nineteen he was named
councillor of the parlement of Paris. Having in this capacity
expressed himself favourable to the adoption of mild measures
in regard to certain persons accused of Lutheranism, he was
arrested, but escaped punishment, and subsequently regained
the favour of the French court. At the end of 1561 he was sent
ambassador to England, where he remained four years. He was
then sent to Venice, and returned a short time afterwards to
England to negotiate a marriage between Queen Elizabeth and
the duke of Anjou. He again fulfilled several important missions
during the reign of Henry III. of France. In 1577 he was made
archbishop of Toulouse, and in 1579 was appointed ambassador
to Rome, where he remained till his death in 1584.

FOIX, a town of south-western France, in the middle ages
capital of the counts of Foix, and now capital of the department
of AriÃ¨ge, 51 m. S. of Toulouse, on the Southern railway from
that city to Ax. Pop. (1906) town, 4498; commune, 6750. It is
situated between the AriÃ¨ge and the Arget at their confluence.
The old part of the town, with its ill-paved winding streets and
old houses, is dominated on the west by an isolated rock crowned
by the three towers of the castle (12th, 14th and 15th centuries),
while to the south it is limited by the shady Promenade de
Villotte. The chief church is that of St Volusien, a Gothic
building of the 14th century. The town is the seat of a prefecture,
a court of assizes and a tribunal of first instance, and has a lycÃ©e,
training colleges, a chamber of commerce and a branch of the
Bank of France. Flour-milling and iron-working are carried on.
Foix probably owes its origin to an oratory founded by Charlemagne.
This afterwards became an abbey, in which were laid
the remains of St Volusien, archbishop of Tours in the 5th
century.

The county of Foix included roughly the eastern part of the
modern department of AriÃ¨ge, a region watered chiefly by the
AriÃ¨ge and its affluents. During the later middle ages it consisted
of an agglomeration of small holdings ruled by lords, who, though
subordinate to the counts of Foix, had some voice in the government
of the district. Protestantism obtained an early entrance
into the county, and the religious struggles of the 16th and 17th
centuries were carried on with much implacability therein. The
estates of the county, which can be traced back to the 14th
century, consisted of three orders and possessed considerable
power and virility. In the 17th and 18th centuries Foix formed
one of the thirty-three governments of France, and in 1790 it was
incorporated in the department of AriÃ¨ge.

Counts of Foix.&mdash;The counts of Foix were an old and distinguished
French family which flourished from the 11th to the
15th century. They were at first feudatories of the counts of
Toulouse, but chafing under this yoke they soon succeeded in
throwing it off, and during the 13th and 14th centuries were
among the most powerful of the French feudal nobles. Living
on the borders of France, having constant intercourse with
Navarre, and in frequent communication with England, they
were in a position peculiarly favourable to an assertion of
independence, and acted rather as the equals than as the
dependents of the kings of France.

The title of count of Foix was first assumed by Roger, son of
Bernard Roger, who was a younger son of Roger I., count of
Carcassonne (d. 1012), when he inherited the town of Foix and
the adjoining lands, which had hitherto formed part of the county
of Carcassonne. Dying about 1064, Roger was succeeded by his
brother Peter, who died six years later, and was succeeded in
turn by his son, Roger II. This count took part in the crusade
of 1095, and was afterwards excommunicated by Pope Paschal II.
for seizing ecclesiastical property; but subsequently he appeased
the anger of the church by rich donations, and when he died
in 1125 he was succeeded by his son, Roger III. The death of
Roger III. about 1149, and of his son, Roger Bernard I., in 1188,
brought the county to Roger Bernard&rsquo;s only son, Raymond
Roger, who, in 1190, accompanied the French king, Philip
Augustus, to Palestine and distinguished himself at the capture
of Acre. He was afterwards engaged in the wars of the Albigenses,
and on being accused of heresy his lands were given to
Simon IV., count of Montfort. Raymond Roger, who came to
terms with the church and recovered his estates before his death
in 1223, was a patron of the ProvenÃ§al poets, and counted
himself among their number. He was succeeded by his son,
Roger Bernard II., called the Great, who assisted Raymond VII.,
count of Toulouse, and the Albigenses in their resistance to the
French kings, Louis VIII. and Louis IX., was excommunicated
on two occasions and died in 1241. His son, Roger IV., who
followed, died in 1265, and was succeeded by his son, Roger
Bernard III., who, more famous as a poet than as a warrior,
was taken prisoner both by Philip III. of France and by Peter
III. of Aragon. This count married Marguerite, daughter and
heiress of Gaston VII., viscount of BÃ©arn (d. 1290), and this union
led to the outbreak of a long feud between the houses of Foix
and Armagnac; a quarrel which was continued by Roger
Bernard&rsquo;s son and successor, Gaston I., who became count
in 1302, inheriting both Foix and BÃ©arn. Becoming embroiled
with the French king, Philip IV., in consequence of the struggle
with the count of Armagnac, Gaston was imprisoned in Paris;
but quickly regaining his freedom he accompanied King Louis X.
on an expedition into Flanders in 1315, and died on his return
to France in the same year. His eldest son, Gaston II., was
the next count. Having become reconciled with the house of
Armagnac, Gaston took part in various wars both in France and
Spain, dying at Seville in 1343, when he was succeeded by his
son, Gaston III. (1331-1391). Gaston III., who was surnamed
Phoebus on account of his beauty, was the most famous member
of the old Foix family. Like his father he assisted France in her
struggle against England, being entrusted with the defence of
the frontiers of Gascony; but when the French king, John II.,
showed a marked preference for the count of Armagnac, Gaston
left his service and went to fight against the heathen in Prussia.
Returning to France about 1357 he delivered some noble ladies
from the attacks of the adherents of the Jacquerie at Meaux, and
was soon at war with the count of Armagnac. During this struggle
he also attacked the count of Poitiers, the royal representative in
Languedoc, but owing to the intervention of Pope Innocent VI.
he made peace with the count in 1360. Gaston, however, continued
to fight against the count of Armagnac, who, in 1362,
was defeated and compelled to pay a ransom; and this war
lasted until 1377, when peace was made. Early in 1380 the
count was appointed governor of Languedoc, but when Charles
VI. succeeded Charles V. as king later in the same year, this
appointment was cancelled. Refusing, however, to heed the
royal command, and supported by the communes of Languedoc,
Gaston fought for about two years against John, duke of Berry,
who had been chosen as his successor, until, worsted in the
combat, he abandoned the struggle and retired to his estates,
remaining neutral and independent. In 1348 the count had
married Agnes, daughter of Philip, count of Evreux (d. 1343),
by his wife Jeanne II., queen of Navarre. By Agnes, whom he
596
divorced in 1373, he had an only son, Gaston, who is said to have
been incited by his uncle, Charles II., king of Navarre, to poison
his father, and who met his death in 1381. It is probable, as
Froissart says, that he was killed by his father. Left without
legitimate sons, Gaston was easily persuaded to bequeath his
lands to King Charles VI., who thus obtained Foix and BÃ©arn
when the count died at Orthes in 1391. Gaston was very fond
of hunting, but was not without a taste for art and literature.
Several beautiful manuscripts are in existence which were executed
by his orders, and he himself wrote DÃ©duits de la chasse
des bestes sauvaiges et des oiseaulx de proye. Froissart, who gives
a graphic description of his court and his manner of life, speaks
enthusiastically of Gaston, saying: &ldquo;I never saw none like him
of personage, nor of so fair form, nor so well made,&rdquo; and again,
&ldquo;in everything he was so perfect that he cannot be praised too
much.&rdquo;

Almost immediately after Gaston&rsquo;s death King Charles VI.
granted the county of Foix to Matthew, viscount of Castelbon,
a descendant of Count Gaston I. Dying without issue in 1398,
Matthew&rsquo;s lands were seized by Archambault, count of Grailly
and captal de Buch, the husband of his sister Isabella (d. 1426),
who became count of Foix in 1401. Archambault&rsquo;s eldest son,
John (c. 1382-1436), who succeeded to his father&rsquo;s lands and
titles in 1412, had married in 1402 Jeanne, daughter of Charles
III., king of Navarre. Having served the king of France in
Guienne and the king of Aragon in Sardinia, John became the
royal representative in Languedoc, when the old quarrel between
Foix and Armagnac broke out again. During the struggle
between the Burgundians and the Armagnacs, he intrigued
with both parties, and consequently was distrusted by the
dauphin, afterwards King Charles VII. Deserting the cause of
France, he then allied himself with Henry V. of England; but
when Charles VII. became king in 1422, he returned to his former
allegiance and became the king&rsquo;s representative in Languedoc
and Guienne. He then assisted to suppress the marauding
bands which were devastating France; fought for Aragon
against Castile; and aided his brother, the cardinal of Foix, to
crush some insurgents in Aragon. Peter, cardinal of Foix (1386-1464),
was the fifth son of Archambault of Grailly, and was made
archbishop of Arles in 1450. He took a prominent part in the
struggle between the rival popes, and founded and endowed
the CollÃ¨ge de Foix at Toulouse. The next count was John&rsquo;s
son, Gaston IV., who married Leonora (d. 1479), a daughter of
John, king of Aragon and Navarre. In 1447 he bought the viscounty
of Narbonne, and having assisted King Charles VII. in
Guienne, he was made a peer of France in 1458. In 1455 his
father-in-law designated him as his successor in Navarre, and
Louis XI. of France gave him the counties of Rousillon and
Cerdagne, and made him his representative in Languedoc and
Guienne; but these marks of favour did not prevent him
from joining a league against Louis in 1471. His eldest son,
Gaston, the husband of Madeleine, a daughter of Charles VII. of
France, died in 1470, and when Gaston IV. died two years later,
his lands descended to his grandson, Francis Phoebus (d. 1483),
who became king of Navarre in 1479, and was succeeded by his
sister Catherine (d. 1517), the wife of Jean d&rsquo;Albret (d. 1516).
Thus the house of Foix-Grailly was merged in that of Albret
and subsequently in that of Bourbon; and when Henry of
Navarre became king of France in 1589 the lands of the counts
of Foix-Grailly became part of the French royal domain. A
younger son of Count Gaston IV. was John (d. 1500), who
received the viscounty of Narbonne from his father and married
Marie, a sister of the French king Louis XII. He was on good
terms both with Louis XI. and Louis XII., and on the death
of his nephew Francis Phoebus, in 1483, he claimed the kingdom
of Navarre against Jean d&rsquo;Albret and his wife, Catherine de
Foix. The ensuing struggle lasted until 1497, when John
renounced his claim. He left a son, Gaston de Foix (1489-1512),
the distinguished French general, and a daughter, Germaine,
who became the second wife of Ferdinand I., king of Spain.
In 1507 Gaston exchanged his viscounty of Narbonne with
King Louis XII. for the duchy of Nemours, and as duke of
Nemours he took command of the French troops in Italy.
Having delivered Bologna and taken Brescia, Gaston encountered
the troops of the Holy League at Ravenna in April 1512, and
after putting the enemy to flight was killed during the pursuit.
From the younger branch of the house of Foix-Grailly have also
sprung the viscounts of Lautrec and of Meilles, the counts of
BÃ©nanges and Candale, and of Gurson and Fleix.

FOLARD, JEAN CHARLES, Chevalier de (1669-1752),
French soldier and military author, was born at Avignon on the
13th of February 1669. His military ardour was first awakened
by reading Caesar&rsquo;s Commentaries, and he ran away from home
and joined the army. He soon saw active service, and, young
as he was, wrote a manual on partisan warfare, the manuscript
of which passed with Folard&rsquo;s other papers to Marshal Belleisle
on the author&rsquo;s death. In 1702 he became a captain, and aide-de-camp
to the duke of VendÃ´me, then in command of the French
forces in Italy. In 1705, while serving under VendÃ´me&rsquo;s brother,
the Grand Prior, Folard won the cross of St Louis for a gallant
feat of arms, and in the same year he distinguished himself at
the battle of Cassano, where he was severely wounded. It was
during his tedious recovery from his wounds that he conceived
the tactical theories to the elucidation of which he devoted most
of his life. In 1706 he again rendered good service in Italy, and
in 1708 distinguished himself greatly in the operations attempted
by VendÃ´me and the duke of Burgundy for the relief of Lille,
the failure of which was due in part to the disagreement of the
French commanders; and it is no small testimony to the ability
and tact of Folard that he retained the friendship of both.
Folard was wounded at Malplaquet in 1709, and in 1711 his
services were rewarded with the governorship of Bourbourg.
He saw further active service in 1714 in Malta, under Charles
XII. of Sweden in the north, and under the duke of Berwick in
the short Spanish War of 1719. Charles XII. he regarded as the
first captain of all time, and it was at Stockholm that Folard
began to formulate his tactical ideas in a commentary on Polybius.
On his way back to France he was shipwrecked and lost all his
papers, but he set to work at once to write his essays afresh,
and in 1724 appeared his Nouvelles DÃ©couvertes sur la guerre dans
une dissertation de Polybe, followed (1727-1730) by Histoire de
Polybe traduite par ... de Thuillier avec un commentaire ...
de M. de Folard, Chevalier de l&rsquo;Ordre de St Louis. Folard spent
the remainder of his life in answering the criticisms provoked
by the novelty of his theories. He died friendless and in obscurity
at Avignon in 1752.

An analysis of Folard&rsquo;s military writings brings to light not
a connected theory of war as a whole, but a great number of
independent ideas, sometimes valuable and suggestive, but far
more often extravagant. The central point of his tactics was
his proposed column formation for infantry. Struck by the
apparent weakness of the thin line of battle of the time, and
arguing from the &#7956;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957; or cuneus of ancient warfare, he desired
to substitute the shock of a deep mass of troops for former
methods of attack, and further considered that in defence a solid
column gave an unshakable stability to the line of battle.
Controversy at once centred itself upon the column. Whilst
some famous commanders, such as Marshal Saxe and Guido
Starhemberg, approved it and put it in practice, the weight of
military opinion throughout Europe was opposed to it, and
eventually history justified this opposition. Amongst the most
discriminating of his critics was Frederick the Great, who is
said to have invited Folard to Berlin. The Prussian king
certainly caused a prÃ©cis to be made by Colonel von Seers, and
wrote a preface thereto expressing his views. The work (like
others by Frederick) fell into unauthorized hands, and, on its
publication (Paris, 1760) under the title Esprit du Chev. Folard,
created a great impression. &ldquo;Thus kept within bounds,&rdquo; said
597
the prince de Ligne, &ldquo;Folard was the best author of the time.&rdquo;
Frederick himself said tersely that &ldquo;Folard had buried diamonds
in a rubbish-heap.&rdquo; Thus began the controversy between line
and column formations, which long continued and influenced
the development of tactics up to the most modern times. Folard&rsquo;s
principal adherents in the 18th century were Joly de Maizeroy
and Menil Durand.

FOLD, a pleat or bend in a flexible material, or a curve in any
surface, whence its particular application in geology with which
this article deals. The verb &ldquo;to fold&rdquo; (O. Eng. fealdan) meant
originally to double back a piece of cloth or other material so as
to form a pleat, whence has evolved its various senses of to roll
up, to enclose, enfold or embrace as with the arms, to clasp the
hands or arms together, &amp;c. The word is common to Teutonic
languages, cf. Ger. falten, Dutch vouwen (for vouden), &amp;c., and the
ultimate Indo-European root is found in Gr. &#960;&#955;&#941;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#957;, Lat.
plicare, plectere, to plait, pleat, weave, and in the suffixes of such
words as &#948;&#953;&#960;&#955;&#940;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;, duplex, double, simplex, &amp;c. Similarly the
termination &ldquo;-fold&rdquo; is added to numbers implying &ldquo;so many,&rdquo;
e.g. twofold, hundredfold, cf. &ldquo;manifold.&rdquo; The similar word
for an enclosure or pen for animals, especially for sheep, and
hence applied in a spiritual sense to a community of worshippers,
or to the whole body of Christians regarded as Christ&rsquo;s flock,
must be distinguished. In O. Eng. it is falÃ¦d, and cognate forms
are found in Dutch vaalt, &amp;c. It apparently meant a planked or
boarded enclosure, cf. Dan. fjael, Swed. fjÃ¶l, plank.

In geology, a fold is a bend or curvature in the stratified
rocks of the earth&rsquo;s crust, whereby they have been made
to take up less horizontal space. The French equivalents are
pli, plissement, ridement; in Germany, Falte, Faltung, Sattelung
are the terms usually employed. It is comparatively rarely that
bedded rocks are observed in the position in which they were
first deposited, a certain amount of buckling up or sagging down
of the crust being continually in progress in one region or another.
In every instance therefore where, in walking over the surface,
we traverse a series of strata which gradually, and without dislocations,
increase or diminish in inclination, we cross part of a
great curvature in the strata of the earth&rsquo;s crust.

Such foldings, however, can often be distinctly seen, either on
some cliff or coast-line, or in the traverse of a piece of hilly or
mountainous ground. The observer cannot long continue his
researches in the field without discovering that the rocks of the
earth&rsquo;s crust have been almost everywhere thrown into curves,
usually so broad and gentle as to escape observation except
when specially looked for. The outcrop of beds at the surface
is commonly the truncation of these curves. The strata must
once have risen above the present surface, and in many cases
may be found descending to the surface again with a contrary dip,
the intervening portion of the undulation having been worn away.



Fig. 1.&mdash;Section of the Isle of Wight&mdash;a Monoclinal Curve, a,
Chalk; b, Woolwich and Reading beds; c, London clay; d, Bagshot
series; e, Headon series; f, g, Osborne and Bembridge series.

The curvature occasionally shows itself among horizontal or
gently inclined strata in the form of an abrupt inclination, and
then an immediate resumption of the previous flat or sloping
character. The strata are thus bent up and continue on the other
side of the tilt at a higher level. Such bends are called monoclines,
monoclinal folds or flexures, because they present only one
fold, or one half of a fold, instead of the two which we see in an
arch or trough. The most notable instance of this structure in
Britain is that of the Isle of Wight, of which a section is given in
fig. 1. The Cretaceous rocks on the south side of the island
rapidly rise in inclination till they become nearly vertical.
The Lower Tertiary strata follow with a similar steep dip, but
rapidly flatten down towards the north coast. Some remarkable
cases of the same structure have been brought to light by J.W.
Powell in his survey of the Colorado region.



Fig. 2.&mdash;Plan of Anticlinal and Synclinal Folds.

It much more frequently happens that the strata have been
bent into arches and troughs, so that they can be seen dipping
under the surface on one side of the axis of a fold, and rising up
again on the other side. Where they dip away from the axis of
movement the structure is termed an anticline or anticlinal fold;
where they dip towards the axis, it is a syncline or synclinal fold.
The diagram in fig. 2 may be taken to represent a series of strata
(1-17) thrown into an anticline (AA&prime;) and syncline (BB&prime;). A
section drawn across these folds in the line CD would show
the structure given in fig. 3. Here we see that, at the part of the
anticlinal axis (A) where the section crosses, bed No. 4 forms the
crown of the arch, Nos. 1, 2 and 3 being concealed beneath it.
On the east side of the axis the strata follow each other in regular
succession as far as No. 13, which, instead of passing here under
the next in order, turns up with a contrary dip and forms the
centre of a trough or syncline (B). From underneath No. 13 on
the east side the same beds rise to the surface which passed
beneath it on the west side. The particular bed marked EF has
been entirely removed by denudation from the top of the anticline,
and is buried deep beneath the centre of the syncline.



Fig. 3.&mdash;Section of Anticlinal and Synclinal Folds on the line CD
(fig. 2).

Such foldings of strata must always die out unless they are
abruptly terminated by dislocations. In the cases given in fig.
2, both the arch and trough are represented as diminishing, the
former towards the north, the latter towards the south. The
observer in passing northwards along the axis of that anticline
finds himself getting into progressively higher strata as the fold
sinks down. On the other hand, in advancing southwards along
the synclinal axis, he loses stratum after stratum and gets into
lower portions of the series. When a fold diminishes in this way
it is said to &ldquo;nose out.&rdquo; In fig. 2 there is obviously a general
inclination of the beds towards the north, besides the outward
dip from the anticline and the inward dip from the syncline.
Hence the anticline noses out to the north and the syncline to
the south.



Fig. 4.

Simple Folds.&mdash;In describing rock-folds special terms have
been assigned to certain portions of the fold; thus, the sloping
598
sides of an anticline or syncline are known as the &ldquo;limbs,&rdquo;
&ldquo;slopes,&rdquo; &ldquo;flanks&rdquo; or &ldquo;members&rdquo; of the fold; in an anticline,
the part X, fig. 3, the angle of the bend, is the &ldquo;crest&rdquo; or
&ldquo;crown&rdquo; (Ger. GewÃ¶lbebiegung, Fr. charniÃ¨re anticlinale), the
corresponding part of a syncline being the &ldquo;trough-core&rdquo; or
&ldquo;base,&rdquo; Y, fig. 3 (Ger. Muldenbiegung, Fr. charniÃ¨re synclinale).
The portion of an anticline which has been removed by denudation
is the &ldquo;aerial arch,&rdquo; dotted in fig. 3. The innermost strata
in a fold constitute the &ldquo;core,&rdquo; arch-core A, fig. 3, or trough-core
B, in the same figure. In the majority of folds the bending
of the strata has taken place about an &ldquo;axial plane&rdquo; (often
called the &ldquo;axis&rdquo;), which in the examples illustrated in fig. 3
would pass through the points A and B, perpendicularly to the
horizontal line CD. In powerfully folded regions the axial
planes of the folds are no longer upright; they may be moderately
inclined, producing an &ldquo;inversion,&rdquo; &ldquo;inverted fold&rdquo; or
&ldquo;overfold.&rdquo; When the inclination of the axial plane is great a
&ldquo;recumbent overfold&rdquo; is produced (Fr. pli couchÃ©, Ger, liegende
Falte). In a fold of this kind (fig. 4) we have an &ldquo;arch limb&rdquo;
(a), a middle limb (b) and a
floor or &ldquo;trough limb&rdquo; (c).
X and Y are the upper and
lower bends respectively.
One of the important functions
of a fold is its direction;
this of course depends
upon the orientation of the
axial plane. The crest-line of an anticline or trough-line of
a syncline is rarely horizontal for any great distance; its
departure from horizontality is designated the &ldquo;pitch,&rdquo; and
the fold is said to pitch (or dip) towards the north, &amp;c. Most
simple folds&mdash;with the exception of very shallow curvatures
of wide area,&mdash;when considered in their entirety, are seen to be
somewhat canoe-shaped in form. There are three variations
of the simple fold dependent upon the position of the limbs,
(1) the limbs may tend to diverge as they recede from the
crest (fig. 3), sometimes styled an &ldquo;open anticline&rdquo;; (2) the
limbs may be parallel in &ldquo;closed&rdquo; folds (commonly known as
isoclinal folding); (3) the limbs may make an open angle or
widen out towards the crest (fig. 4). This is known as a fan-shaped
fold (Fr. pli en Ã©ventail, Ger. FÃ¤cherfalte); another
variant of the same form is the mushroom fold (Fr. pli en champignon).
The axial plane is not always extended: it may be
so abbreviated that the folding appears to have taken place
about a point; anticlines of this type are variously designated
&ldquo;short-anticlines,&rdquo; &ldquo;brachyanticlinaux&rdquo; or &ldquo;domes&rdquo;; similarly,
there are &ldquo;short-synclines,&rdquo; &ldquo;brachysynclinaux&rdquo; or
&ldquo;cuvettes.&rdquo; The dip in cases of this kind has been described as
&ldquo;qua-qua versal&rdquo; or &ldquo;periclinal.&rdquo;

Complex Folding.&mdash;Sometimes a simple fold has been itself
subjected to further folding repeated more than once, it is then
termed a &ldquo;refolded fold&rdquo; (Fr. pli repliÃ©); fine examples may be
observed in the Alps and in other mountain chains. A great
regional major fold containing within itself a number of minor
&ldquo;special&rdquo; or subsidiary folds is described as a &ldquo;geanticline&rdquo;
(Fr. structure en Ã©ventail composÃ©), or as a &ldquo;geosyncline&rdquo; (Fr.
structure en Ã©ventail renversÃ©). Even folds of lesser magnitude
may be highly complex in regions of extreme crustal movement,
and may contain smaller folds of the first, second, third or higher
order (Fr. couches gaufrÃ©es [fig. 5]). In its smaller manifestation,
this class of folding passes into &ldquo;crumpling&rdquo; or &ldquo;puckering,&rdquo;
where quite a large number of folds may be crowded into a single
hand specimen. In &ldquo;frilling&rdquo; or &ldquo;frilled structure&rdquo; the folds
have still smaller amplitude, and in many highly corrugated
rocks minute folds are observable with the microscope that do
not appear to the unaided eye. When a series of adjacent isoclinal
overfolds has passed into a series of thrusts (see Fault),
the so-called &ldquo;imbricated&rdquo; structure (Fr. structure imbriquÃ©e,
Ger. Schuppenstruktur) is generated. Occasionally crust-blocks
resembling &ldquo;graben&rdquo; and &ldquo;horsts&rdquo; are circumscribed by folds
instead of faults; when this is so they have been called respectively
&ldquo;infolded graben&rdquo; or &ldquo;overfolded horsts.&rdquo;

The heterogeneous character of great masses of strata has
always had a marked influence on the nature of the folding;
some beds have yielded much more readily than others, certain
beds will be found to be faulted, while those above and below
have folded without fracture. In many examples of apparent
plasticity it can be shown that this effect has been produced
by an infinite number of minute slippings within the rock
substance.



Fig. 5.&mdash;Curved and Contorted Rocks, near Old Head of Kinsale.
(Du Noyer.)

The larger rock folds have produced important economic
results. For example, in many coal regions the deposits have
been conserved in some districts in the synclines or &ldquo;basins,&rdquo;
while they have been removed by denudation from the uplifted
anticlines in others. Near the crest of anticlines is commonly
an enriched portion of the ground in mineralized districts; and,
in the case of water supply, the tilt of the strata determines the
direction of the underground flowage. Again, the most convenient
site for oil wells is the crest of an anticline or &ldquo;dome,&rdquo;
where an impervious stratum imprisons the gas and oil in a
subjacent saturated layer under pressure.

FOLENGO, TEOFILO (1491-1544), otherwise known as Merlino
Coccajo or Cocajo, one of the principal Italian macaronic poets,
was born of noble parentage at Cipada near Mantua on the 8th
of November 1491, From his infancy he showed great vivacity
of mind, and a remarkable cleverness in making verses. At the
age of sixteen he entered the monastery of Monte Casino near
Brescia, and eighteen months afterwards he became a professed
member of the Benedictine order. For a few years his life as a
monk seems to have been tolerably regular, and he is said to
have produced a considerable quantity of Latin verse, written,
not unsuccessfully, in the Virgilian style. About the year 1516
he forsook the monastic life for the society of a well-born young
woman named Girolama Dieda, with whom he wandered about
the country for several years, often suffering great poverty,
having no other means of support than his talent for versification.
His first publication was the Merlini Cocaii macaronicon, which
relates the adventures of a fictitious hero named Baldus. The
coarse buffoonery of this work is often relieved by touches of
genuine poetry, as well as by graphic descriptions and acute
criticisms of men and manners. Its macaronic style is rendered
peculiarly perplexing to the foreigner by the frequent introduction
of words and phrases from the Mantuan patois. Though frequently
censured for its occasional grossness of idea and expression,
it soon attained a wide popularity, and within a very
few years passed through several editions. Folengo&rsquo;s next
production was the Orlandino, an Italian poem of eight cantos,
written in rhymed octaves. It appeared in 1526, and bore on
the title-page the new pseudonym of Limerno Pitocco (Merlin
the Beggar) da Mantova. In the same year, wearied with a life
of dissipation, Folengo returned to his ecclesiastical obedience;
and shortly afterwards wrote his Chaos del tri per uno, in which,
partly in prose, partly in verse, sometimes in Latin, sometimes
in Italian, and sometimes in macaronic, he gives a veiled account
of the vicissitudes of the life he had lived under his various names,
599
We next find him about the year 1533 writing in rhymed octaves
a life of Christ entitled L&rsquo;UmanitÃ  del Figliuolo di Dio; and he is
known to have composed, still later, another religious poem upon
the creation, fall and restoration of man, besides a few tragedies.
These, however, have never been published. Some of his later
years were spent in Sicily under the patronage of Don Fernando
de Gonzaga, the viceroy; he even appears for a short time to
have had charge of a monastery there. In 1543 he retired to
Santa Croce de Campesio, near Bassano; and there he died on
the 9th of December 1544.


Folengo is frequently quoted and still more frequently copied by
Rabelais. The earlier editions of his Opus macaronicum are now
extremely rare. The often reprinted edition of 1530 exhibits the
text as revised by the author after he had begun to amend his life.




FOLEY, JOHN HENRY (1818-1874), Irish sculptor, was born
at Dublin on the 24th of May 1818. At thirteen he began to
study drawing and modelling at the schools of the Royal Dublin
Society, where he took several first-class prizes. In 1835 he was
admitted a student in the schools of the Royal Academy, London.
He first appeared as an exhibitor in 1839 with his &ldquo;Death of
Abel and Innocence.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ino and Bacchus,&rdquo; exhibited in 1840,
gave him immediate reputation, and the work itself was afterwards
commissioned to be done in marble for the earl of Ellesmere.
&ldquo;Lear and Cordelia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Death of Lear&rdquo; were
exhibited in 1841. &ldquo;Venus rescuing Aeneas&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Houseless
Wanderer&rdquo; in 1842, &ldquo;Prospero and Miranda&rdquo; in 1843. In
1844 Foley sent to the exhibition at Westminster Hall his
&ldquo;Youth at a Stream,&rdquo; and was, with Calder Marshall and John
Bell, chosen by the commissioners to do work in sculpture for
the decoration of the Houses of Parliament. Statues of John
Hampden and Selden were executed for this purpose, and received
liberal praise for the propriety, dignity and proportion of their
treatment. Commissions of all kinds now began to come rapidly.
Fanciful works, busts, bas-reliefs, tablets and monumental
statues were in great numbers undertaken and executed by him
with a steady equality of worthy treatment. In 1849 he was
made an associate and in 1858 a member of the Royal Academy.
Among his numerous works the following may be noticed,
besides those mentioned above:&mdash;&ldquo;The Mother&rdquo;; &ldquo;Egeria,&rdquo;
for the Mansion House; &ldquo;The Elder Brother in Comus,&rdquo; his
diploma work; &ldquo;The Muse of Painting,&rdquo; the monument of
James Ward, R.A.; &ldquo;Caractacus,&rdquo; for the Mansion House;
&ldquo;Helen Faucit&rdquo;; &ldquo;Goldsmith&rdquo; and &ldquo;Burke,&rdquo; for Trinity
College, Dublin; &ldquo;Faraday&rdquo;; &ldquo;Reynolds&rdquo;; &ldquo;Barry,&rdquo; for
Westminster Palace Yard; &ldquo;John Stuart Mill,&rdquo; for the Thames
embankment; &ldquo;O&rsquo;Connell&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cough,&rdquo; for Dublin;
&ldquo;Clyde,&rdquo; for Glasgow; &ldquo;Clive,&rdquo; for Shrewsbury; &ldquo;Hardinge,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Canning&rdquo; and &ldquo;Outram,&rdquo; for Calcutta; &ldquo;Hon. James
Stewart,&rdquo; for Ceylon; the symbolical group &ldquo;Asia,&rdquo; as well as
the statue of the prince himself, for the Albert Memorial in
Hyde Park; and &ldquo;Stonewall Jackson,&rdquo; in Richmond, Va.
The statue of Sir James Outram is probably his masterpiece.
Foley&rsquo;s early fanciful works have some charming qualities; but
he will probably always be best remembered for the workmanlike
and manly style of his monumental portraits. He died at
Hampstead on the 27th of August 1874, and on the 4th of
September was buried in St Paul&rsquo;s cathedral. He left his models
to the Royal Dublin Society, his early school, and a great part
of his property to the Artists&rsquo; Benevolent Fund.

FOLEY, SIR THOMAS (1757-1833), British admiral, entered
the navy in 1770, and, during his time as midshipman, saw a
good deal of active service in the West Indies against American
privateers. Promoted lieutenant in 1778, he served under
Admiral (afterwards Viscount) Keppel and Sir Charles Hardy
in the Channel, and with Rodney&rsquo;s squadron was present at
the defeat of De LÃ¡ngara off Cape St Vincent in 1780, and at the
relief of Gibraltar. Still under Rodney&rsquo;s command, he went
out to the West Indies, and took his part in the operations which
culminated in the victory of the 12th of April 1782. In the
Revolutionary War he was engaged from the first. As flag-captain
to Admiral John Gell, and afterwards to Sir Hyde
Parker, Foley took part in the siege of Toulon in 1793, the action
of Golfe Jouan in 1794, and the two fights off Toulon on the 13th
of April and the 13th of July 1795. At St Vincent he was flag-captain
to the second in command, and in the following year
was sent out in command of the &ldquo;Goliath&rdquo; (74), to reinforce
Nelson&rsquo;s fleet in the Mediterranean. The part played by the
&ldquo;Goliath&rdquo; in the battle of the Nile was brilliant. She led the
squadron round the French van, and this man&oelig;uvre contributed
not a little to the result of the day. Whether this was done by
Foley&rsquo;s own initiative, or intended by Nelson, has been a matter
of controversy (see Journal of the Royal United Service Institution,
1885, p. 916). His next important service was with Nelson in
the Baltic. The &ldquo;Elephant&rdquo; carried Nelson&rsquo;s flag at the battle
of Copenhagen, and her captain acted as his chief-of-staff. Ill-health
obliged Foley to decline Nelson&rsquo;s offer (made when on the
point of starting for the battle of Trafalgar) of the post of Captain
of the Fleet. From 1808 to 1815 he commanded in the Downs
and at the peace was made K.C.B. Sir Thomas Foley rose to be
full admiral and G.C.B. He died while commanding in chief at
Portsmouth in 1833.


See J.B. Herbert, Life and Services of Sir Thomas Foley (Cardiff,
1884).




FOLI (Foley), ALLAN JAMES (1837-1899), Irish bass singer,
was born at Cahir, Tipperary, on the 7th of August 1837;
originally a carpenter, he studied under Bisaccia at Naples, and
made his first appearance at Catania in 1862. From the opera
in Paris he was engaged by Mapleson for the season of 1865, and
appeared with much success in various parts. He sang in the
first performance of The Flying Dutchman (Daland) in England
in 1870, and in the first performance of Gounod&rsquo;s Redemption in
1882. He was distinguished in opera and oratorio alike for his
vigorous, straightforward way of singing, and was in great request
at ballad concerts. He died on the 20th of October 1899.



FOLIGNO (anc. Fulginiae, q.v.), a town and episcopal see of
Umbria, Italy, 771 ft. above sea-level, in the province of Perugia,
from which it is 25 m. S.E. by rail. Pop. (1901) 9532 (town),
26,278 (commune). It lies in a fertile plain, on the Topino, a
tributary of the Tiber; it is almost square in shape and is surrounded
by walls. It is a picturesque and interesting town;
several of its churches contain paintings by Umbrian masters,
notably works by NiccolÃ² di Liberatore (or NiccolÃ² Alunno,
1430-1502), and among them his chief work, a large altar-piece
(the predella of which is in the Louvre) in S. NiccolÃ². The
cathedral has a romanesque S. faÃ§ade of 1133, restored in 1903;
the interior was modernized in the 18th century. To the left
of the choir is an octagonal chapel by Antonio da Sangallo the
younger (1527). In the same piazza as the S. faÃ§ade is the Palazzo
del Governo, erected in 1350, which has a chapel with frescoes
by Ottaviano Nelli of Gubbio (1424). S. Maria infra Portas is
said to date from the 7th century, but from this period only
the columns of the portico remain. Raphael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Madonna
di Foligno,&rdquo; now in the Vatican, was originally painted for the
church of S. Anna. The Palazzo Orfini and the Palazzo Deli are
two good Renaissance buildings.

Foligno seems to have been founded about the middle of the
8th century A.D. It changed hands often during the wars of the
13th century, and was destroyed by Perugia in 1281. From
1305 to 1439 it was governed by the family of the Trinci as
deputies of the Holy See, until in the latter year one of its members
went against the church. Pope Eugene IV. sent a force against
Foligno, to which the inhabitants opened their gates, and the
last of the Trinci, Corrado II., was beheaded. Henceforth
Foligno belonged to the states of the church until 1860. It
suffered from a severe earthquake in 1832. Foligno is a station
on the main line from Rome (via Orte) to Ancona, and is the
junction for Perugia. Three miles to the E. is the abbey of
Sassovivo with cloisters of 1229, very like those of S. Paolo
fuori le Mura at Rome, with pairs of small columns supporting
arches, and decorations in coloured mosaic (&ldquo;Cosmatesque&rdquo;
work). The church has been modernized.



FOLIO (properly the ablative case of the Lat. folium, leaf, but
also frequently an adaptation of the Ital. foglio), a term in
600
bibliography and printing, with reference either to the size of
paper employed, or of the book, or to the pagination. In the
phrase &ldquo;in folio&rdquo; it means a sheet of paper folded once, and
thus a book bound up in sheets thus folded is a book of the largest
size and is known as a &ldquo;folio&rdquo; (see Bibliography). Similarly,
&ldquo;folio&rdquo; is one of the sizes of paper adapted to be thus folded
(see Paper). In book-keeping the word is used for a page in a
ledger on which the credit and debtor account is written; in
law-writing, for a fixed number of words in a legal document,
used for measurement of the length and for the addition of costs.
In Great Britain, a &ldquo;folio&rdquo; is taken to contain 72 words, except
in parliamentary and chancery documents, when the number
is 90. In the U.S.A. 100 words form a &ldquo;folio.&rdquo;







FOLIUM, in mathematics, a curve invented and discussed by
RenÃ© Descartes. Its cartesian equation is xÂ³ + yÂ³ = 3axy. The
curve is symmetrical about the line x = y,
and consists of two infinite branches
asymptotic to the line x + y + a = o and
a loop in the first quadrant. It may be
traced by giving m various values in the
equations x = 3am / (1 + mÂ³), y = 3amÂ²
(1 + mÂ³), since by eliminating m between
these relations the equation to the curve
is obtained. Hence it is unicursal (see
Curve). The area of the loop, which
equals the area between the curve
and its asymptote, is 3a/2.



FOLKES, MARTIN (1690-1754), English antiquary, was born
in London on the 29th of October 1690. He was educated at
Saumur University and Clare College, Cambridge, where he so
distinguished himself in mathematics that when only twenty-three
years of age he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society.
He was elected one of the council in 1716, and in 1723 Sir Isaac
Newton, president of the society, appointed him one of the vice-presidents.
On the death of Newton he became a candidate
for the presidency, but was defeated by Sir Hans Sloane, whom,
however, he succeeded in 1741; in 1742 he was made a member
of the French Academy; in 1746 he received honorary degrees
from Oxford and Cambridge. In 1733 he set out on a tour
through Italy, in the course of which he composed his Dissertations
on the Weights and Values of Ancient Coins. Before the
Society of Antiquaries, of which he was president from 1749 to
1754, he read in 1736 his Observations on the Trajan and Antonine
Pillars at Rome and his Table of English Gold Coins from the 18th
Year of King Edward III. In 1745 he printed the latter with
another on the history of silver coinage. He also contributed
both to the Society of Antiquaries and to the Royal Society
other papers, chiefly on Roman antiquities. He married in
1714 Lucretia Bradshaw, an actress who had appeared at the
Haymarket and Drury Lane (see Nichols&rsquo;s Lit. Anecdot. ii.
578-598).

FOLKESTONE, a municipal borough, seaport and watering-place
of Kent, England, within the parliamentary borough of
Hythe, 71 m. S.E. by E. of London by the South-Eastern &amp;
Chatham railway. Pop. (1891) 23,905; (1901) 30,650. This is
one of the principal ports in cross-Channel communications, the
steamers serving Boulogne, 30 m. distant. The older part of
Folkestone lies in a small valley which here opens upon the shore
between steep hills. The more modern portions extend up the
hills on either hand. To the north the town is sheltered
by hills rising sharply to heights of 400 to 500 ft., on several of
which, such as Sugarloaf and Castle Hills, are ancient earthworks.
Above the cliff west of the old town is a broad promenade
called the Lees, commanding a notable view of the channel
and connected by lifts with the shore below. On this cliff also
stands the parish church of St Mary and St Eanswith, a cruciform
building of much interest, with central tower. It is mainly Early
English, but the original church, attached to a Benedictine
priory, was founded in 1095 on the site of a convent established
by Eanswith, daughter of Eadbald, king of Kent in 630. The
site of this foundation, however, became endangered by encroachments
of the sea. The monastery was destroyed at the
dissolution of religious houses by Henry VIII. Folkestone inner
harbour is dry at low water, but there is a deep water pier for
use at low tide by the Channel steamers, by which not only
the passenger traffic, but also a large general trade are carried
on. The fisheries are important. Among institutions may be
mentioned the grammar school, founded in 1674, the public
library and museum, and a number of hospitals and sanatoria.
The discontinued Harveian Institution for young men was
named after William Harvey, discoverer of the circulation of the
blood, a native of Folkestone (1578), who is also commemorated
by a tercentenary memorial on the Lees. Folkestone is a member
of the Cinque Port of Dover. It is governed by a mayor, 7
aldermen and 21 councillors. Area, 2522 acres. To the west of
Folkestone, close to Shorncliffe camp, is the populous suburb
of Cheriton (an urban district, pop. 7091).

Folkestone (Folcestan) was among the possessions of Earl
Godwine and was called upon to supply him with ships when he
was exiled from England; at the time of the Domesday Survey
it belonged to Odo, bishop of Bayeux. From early times it was
a member of the Cinque Port of Dover, and had to find one out
of the twenty-one ships furnished by that port for the royal
service. It shared the privileges of the Cinque Ports, whose
liberties were exemplified at the request of the barons of Folkestone
by Edward III. in 1330. The corporation, which was
prescriptive, was entitled the mayor, jurats and commonalty
of Folkestone. The history of Folkestone is a record of its
struggle against the sea, which was constantly encroaching
upon the town. In 1629 the inhabitants, impoverished by their
losses, obtained licence to erect a port. By the end of the 18th
century the town had become prosperous by the increase of its
fishing and shipping trades, and by the middle of the 19th century
one of the chief health and pleasure resorts of the south coast.



FOLKLAND (folcland). This term occurs three times in Anglo-Saxon
documents. In a law of Edward the Elder (c. i. 2) it is
contrasted with bookland in a way which shows that these two
kinds of tenure formed the two main subdivisions of landownership:
no one is to deny right to another in respect of folkland or
bookland. By a charter of 863 (Cod. Dipl. 281), King Ã†thelberht
exchanges five hides of folkland for five hides of bookland which
had formerly belonged to a thane, granting the latter for the
newly-acquired estates exemption from all fiscal exactions except
the threefold public obligation of attending the fyrd and joining
in the repair of fortresses and bridges. Evidently folkland was
not free from the payment of gafÃ¥l (land tax) and providing
quarters for the king&rsquo;s men. In ealdorman Alfred&rsquo;s will the
testator disposes freely of his bookland estates in favour of his
sons and his daughter, but to a son who is not considered as
rightful offspring five hides of folkland are left, provided the
king consents. It is probable that folkland is meant in two or
three cases when Latin documents speak of terra rei publicae
jure possessa.

Two principal explanations have been given to this term.
Allen thought that folkland was similar to the Roman ager
publicus: it was the common property of the nation (folc),
and the king had to dispose of it by carving out dependent
tenures for his followers more or less after the fashion of continental
beneficia. These estates remained subject to the superior
ownership of the folk and of the king: they could eventually
be taken back by the latter and, in any case, the heir of a holder
of folkland had to be confirmed in possession by the king. A
letter of Bede to the archbishop Ecgbert of York may be interpreted
to apply to this kind of tenure. Kemble, K. Maurer,
H.C. Lodge, Stubbs and others followed Allen&rsquo;s lead.

Another theory was started by Professor Vinogradoff in an
article on folkland in the English Hist. Review for 1893. It
considers folkland as landownership by folkright&mdash;at common
law, as might be said in modern legal speech. In opposition to it
bookland appears as landownership derived from royal privilege.
The incidents recorded in the charters characterize folkland as
601
subject to ordinary fiscal burdens and to limitations in respect of
testamentary succession. Thane Wallaf has to be relieved from
fiscal exactions when his estate is converted from folkland into
bookland (C.D. 281). Ealdorman Alfred&rsquo;s son, not being recognized
as legitimate, has to claim folkland not by direct succession
or devise, but by the consent of the king. These incidents and
limitations are thrown into relief by copious illustrations as to
the fundamental features of bookland contained in the numberless
&ldquo;books.&rdquo; These are exemptions from fiscal dues and
freedom of disposition of the owner. This view of the matter has
been accepted by the chief modern authorities.

FOLKLORE, a term invented in 1846 by Mr W.J. Thoms as a
designation for the traditional learning of the uncultured classes
of civilized nations. The word has been adopted in this sense
into many foreign languages; it is sometimes regarded as the
equivalent of the Ger. Volkskunde. But folklore is, properly
speaking, the &ldquo;lore of the folk,&rdquo; while Volkskunde is lore or
learning about the folk, and includes not only the mental life
of a people, but also their arts and crafts. The term folklore is
also used to designate the science which deals with folklore;
the study of survivals involves the investigation of the similar
customs, beliefs, &amp;c., of races on lower planes of culture; consequently
folklore, as interpreted by the English and American
societies, concerns itself as much or more with savage races as
with the popular superstitions of the white races.

History.&mdash;The scientific study of folklore dates back to the
first quarter of the 19th century, but folklore was collected long
before that date. The organized study of folklore is a thing of
recent growth. The first Folklore Society was founded in London
in 1878; similar bodies now exist in the United States, France,
Italy, Switzerland and especially in Germany and Austria.
The folk-tale makes its appearance in literature at a very early
period; Egyptian examples have come down to us from the
28th century B.C. In Greece the Homeric poems contain many
folk-tale incidents; for India we have the Jatakas and Panchatantra;
and for the Arabs the great collection of the Thousand
and One Nights. Another type of folk-narrative is represented
by Aesop&rsquo;s Fables. Not unnaturally beliefs and customs received
less attention; our knowledge of them among the ancients is as
a rule pieced together. Among the oldest professed collections
are J.B. Thiers (1606-1703), TraitÃ© des superstitions (1679),
Aubrey&rsquo;s Miscellanies (1686) and H. Bourne&rsquo;s (1696-1733)
Antiquitates vulgares (1725); but they belong to the antiquarian,
non-scientific period.

The pioneers of the modern scientific treatment of folklore
were the brothers Grimm, by the publication of their Kinder-und
HausmÃ¤rchen (1812-1815) and Deutsche Mythologie (1835).
They were the first to present the folk-tale in its genuine unadulterated
form. They differed from their predecessors in
regarding the myth, not as the result of conscious speculation,
but of a mythopoeic impulse. They were, however, disposed to
press modern linguistic evidence too far and make the figures
of the folk-tale the lineal representatives of ancient gods, as the
folk-tales themselves were of the myths. This tendency was
exaggerated by their successors, J.W. Wolf, W. Rochholz and
others. At the outset of his career, W. Mannhardt (1831-1880),
the forerunner of the anthropological school of folklore, shared
in this mistake. Breaking away eventually from the philological
schools, which interpreted myths and their supposed descendants,
the folk-tales, as relating to the storm, the sun, the dawn, &amp;c.
(see Mythology), Mannhardt made folk-custom and belief his
basis. To this end he set himself to collect and compare the
superstitions of the peasantry; but his health was always
feeble and he never completed his scheme. For a time Mannhardt&rsquo;s
researches bore fruit neither in his own country nor
abroad. In 1878 the foundation of the Folklore Society marked
a new era in England, where the philological school had had
few adherents; and the anthropological school soon produced
evidence of its vitality in the works of Mr Andrew Lang, Dr J.G.
Frazer and Professor Robertson Smith.

With the growth of our knowledge of European folk-custom
and belief on the one hand, and of rites and religions of people
in the lower stages of culture on the other hand, it has become
abundantly clear that there is no line of demarcation between
the two. Each throws light upon the other, and the superstitions
of Europe are the lineal descendants of savage creeds
which have their parallels all over the world in the culture of
primitive peoples.

Subdivisions.&mdash;The folklore of civilized peoples may be
conveniently classified under three main heads: (1) belief and
custom; (2) narratives and sayings; (3) art. These again may
be subdivided. The first division, Belief and Custom, includes
(A) Superstitious beliefs and practices, including (a) those
connected with natural phenomena or inanimate nature, (b)
tree and plant superstitions, (c) animal superstitions, (d) ghosts
and goblins, (e) witchcraft, (f) leechcraft, (g) magic in general
and divination, (h) eschatology, and (i) miscellaneous superstitions
and practices; and (B) Traditional customs, including
(a) festival customs for which are set aside certain days and
seasons, (b) ceremonial customs on the occasion of events such as
birth, death or marriage, (c) games, (d) miscellaneous local
customs, such as agricultural rites connected with the corn-spirit
(see Demonology), and (e) dances. The second head of Narratives
and Sayings may be subdivided (A) into (a) sagas or tales
told as true, (b) MÃ¤rchen or nursery tales, (c) fables, (d) drolls,
apologues, cumulative tales, &amp;c., (e) myths (see Mythology),
and (f) place legends; (B) into ballads and songs (in so far as
they do not come under art); and (C) into nursery rhymes,
riddles, jingles, proverbs, nicknames, place rhymes, &amp;c. The
third head, Art, subdivides into (a) folk music with ballads and
songs, (b) folk drama. Any classification, however, labours
under the disadvantage of separating items which properly
belong together. Thus, myths are obviously the form in
which some superstitions are expressed. They may also be
aetiological in their nature and form an elaborate record of a
custom. Eschatological beliefs naturally take the form of myths.
Traditional narratives can also be classified under art, and so on.

Literature.&mdash;The literature of the subject falls into two sharply
defined classes&mdash;synthetic works and collections of folklore&mdash;of
which the latter are immensely more numerous. Of the former
class the most important is Dr J.G. Frazer&rsquo;s Golden Bough,
which sets out from the study of a survival in Roman religion
and covers a wide field of savage and civilized beliefs and customs.
Especially important are the chapters on agricultural rites, in
which are set forth the results of Mannhardt&rsquo;s researches. Other
important lines of folklore research in the Golden Bough are
those dealing with spring ceremonies, with the primitive view
of the soul, with animal cults, and with sun and rain charms.
Mr E.S. Hartland&rsquo;s Legend of Perseus is primarily concerned
with the origin of a folk-tale, and this problem in the end is
dismissed as insoluble. A large part of the book is taken up
with a discussion of sympathetic magic, and especially with the
&ldquo;life index,&rdquo; an object so bound up with the life of a human
being that it acts as an indication of his well-being or otherwise.
The importance of children&rsquo;s games in the study of folklore has
been recognized of recent years. An admirable collection of the
games of England has been published by Mrs G.L. Gomme.
With the more minute study of uncivilized peoples the problem
of the diffusion of games has also come to the fore. In particular
it is found that the string-game called &ldquo;cat&rsquo;s cradle&rdquo; in various
forms is of very wide diffusion, being found even in Australia.
The question of folk-music has recently received much attention
(see Song).

FOLLEN, AUGUST (or, as he afterwards called himself,
Adolf) LUDWIG (1794-1855), German poet, was born at Giessen
on the 21st of January 1794, the son of a district judge. He
studied theology at Giessen and law at Heidelberg, and after
leaving the university edited the Elberfeld Allgemeine Zeitung.
Suspected of being connected with some radical plots, he was
imprisoned for two years in Berlin. When released in 1821 he
went to Switzerland, where he taught in the canton school at
Aarau, farmed from 1847-1854 the estate of Liebenfels in
Thurgau, and then retired to Bern, where he lived till his death
on the 26th of December 1855. Besides a number of minor
poems he wrote HarfengrÃ¼sse aus Deutschland und der Schweiz
(1823) and Malegys und Vivian (1829), a knightly romance after
the fashion of the romantic school. Of his many translations,
mention may be made of the Homeric Hymns in collaboration
with R. Schwenck (1814), Tasso&rsquo;s Jerusalem Delivered (1818)
and Siegfrieds Tod from the Nibelungenlied (1842); he also
collected and translated Latin hymns and sacred poetry (1819).
In 1846 he published a brief collection of sonnets entitled An
die gottlosen NichtswÃ¼teriche. This was aimed at the liberal
philosopher Arnold Ruge, and was the occasion of a literary duel
between the two authors. Follen&rsquo;s posthumous poem Tristans
Eltern (1857) may also be mentioned, but his best-known work
is a collection of German poetry entitled Bildersaal deutscher
Dichtung (1827).



FOLLEN, KARL (1795-1840), German poet and patriot, brother
of A.L. Follen, was born at Romrod in Hesse-Darmstadt, on the
5th of September 1795. He first studied theology at Giessen,
but after the campaign of 1814, in which, like his brother
August, he took part as a Hessian volunteer, began the study of
jurisprudence, and in 1818 established himself as Privatdocent
of civil law at Giessen. Owing to being suspected of political
intrigues, he removed to Jena, and thence, after the assassination
of Kotzebue, fled to France. Here again the political murder
of the duc de Berry, on the 14th of January 1820, led to Follen
being regarded as a suspect, and he accordingly took refuge in
Switzerland, where he taught for a while at the cantonal school
at Coire and at the university of Basel; but the Prussian
authorities imperatively demanding his surrender, he sought in
1824 the hospitality of the United States of America. Here he
became an instructor in German at Harvard in 1825, and in 1830
obtained an appointment as professor of German language
and literature there; but his anti-slavery agitation having
given umbrage to the authorities, he forfeited his post in 1835,
and was ordained Unitarian minister of a chapel at Lexington in
Massachusetts in 1836. He perished at sea on board a steamboat
which was totally consumed by fire while on a voyage from
New York to Boston, on the night of the 13th-14th of January
1840. Follen was the author of several celebrated patriotic
songs written in the interests of liberty. The best is perhaps
Horch auf, ihr FÃ¼rsten! Du Volk, horch auf! of which Johannes
Wit, called von DÃ¶rring (1800-1863), was long, though erroneously,
considered the author. It was published in A.L. Follen&rsquo;s
collection of patriotic songs, Freie Stimmen frischer Jugend.


His wife Elisa Lee (1787-1860), an American authoress of some
reputation, published after his death his lectures and sermons, with
a biography written by herself (5 vols., Boston, 1846).




FOLLETT, SIR WILLIAM WEBB (1798-1845), English lawyer,
was born at Topsham in Devonshire on the 2nd of December
1798. He was the son of Captain Benjamin Follett, who had
retired from the army in 1790, and engaged in business at
Topsham. He received his education at Exeter grammar school
and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1818. He had
entered the Inner Temple in 1816 and began to practise as a
pleader below the bar in 1821, but was called to the bar in 1824,
and joined the western circuit in 1825. At the very outset
his great qualifications were universally recognized. He was
thoroughly master of his profession, and his rapid rise in it was
due not only to his quick perception and sound judgment, but
to his singular courtesy, kindness and sweetness of temper.
In 1830 he married the eldest daughter of Sir Ambrose Harding
Gifford, chief justice of Ceylon. In 1835 he was returned to
parliament for Exeter. In parliament he early distinguished
himself, and under the first administration of Sir Robert Peel
was appointed solicitor-general (November 1834); but resigned
with the ministry in April 1835. In the course of this year he was
knighted. On the return of Peel to power in 1841 Sir William
was again appointed solicitor-general, and in April 1844 he succeeded
Sir Frederick Pollock as attorney-general. But his
health, which had begun to fail him in 1838, and had been
permanently injured by a severe illness in 1841, now broke down,
and he was compelled to relinquish practice and to visit the
south of Europe. He returned to England in March 1845; but
the disease, consumption, reasserted itself, and he died in
London on the 28th of June following. A statue of Follett,
executed by Behnes, was erected by subscription in Westminster
Abbey.



FONBLANQUE, ALBANY WILLIAM (1793-1872), English
journalist, descended from a noble French Huguenot family,
the Greniers of Languedoc, was born in London in 1793. John
Grenier, a banker, became naturalized in England under the
name of Fonblanque; and his son John Samuel Martin Fonblanque
(1760-1838), a distinguished equity lawyer, and the
author of a standard legal work, a Treatise on Equity, was the
father of Albany Fonblanque; he represented the borough of
Camelford in parliament; and was one of the Whig friends of
George IV. when prince of Wales. At fourteen young Fonblanque
was sent to Woolwich to prepare for the Royal Engineers. His
health, however, failed, and for two years his studies had to be
suspended. Upon his recovery he studied for some time with a
view to being called to the bar. At the age of nineteen (1812)
he commenced writing for the newspapers, and very soon attracted
notice both by the boldness and liberality of his opinions, and by
603
the superiority of his style to what Macaulay, when speaking of
him, justly called the &ldquo;rant and twaddle of the daily and weekly
press&rdquo; of the time. While he was eagerly taking his share in all
the political struggles of this eventful period, he was also continuing
his studies, devoting no less than six hours a day to the
study of classics and political philosophy. Under this severe
mental training his health once more broke down. His energy,
however, was not impaired. He became a regular contributor to
the newspapers and reviews, realizing a fair income which, as his
habits were simple and temperate, secured him against pecuniary
anxieties.

From 1820 to 1830 Albany Fonblanque was successively
employed upon the staff of The Times and the Morning Chronicle,
whilst he contributed to the Examiner, to the London Magazine
and to the Westminster Review. In 1828 the Examiner newspaper,
which had been purchased by the Rev. Dr Fellowes, author of the
Religion of the Universe, &amp;c., was given over to Fonblanque&rsquo;s
complete control; and for a period of seventeen years (1830 to
1847) he not only sustained the high character for political independence
and literary ability which the Examiner had gained
under the direction of Leigh Hunt and his brother, John Hunt,
but even compelled his political opponents to acknowledge a
certain delight in the boldness and brightness of the wit directed
against themselves. When it was proposed that the admirers
and supporters of the paper should facilitate a reduction in its
price by the payment of their subscription ten years in advance,
not only did Mr Edward Bulwer (Lord Lytton) volunteer his
aid, but also Mr Disraeli, who was then coquetting with radicalism.
During his connexion with the Examiner, Fonblanque had
many advantageous offers of further literary employment;
but he devoted his energies and talents almost exclusively to
the service of the paper he had resolved to make a standard of
literary excellence in the world of journalism. Fonblanque was
offered the governorship of Nova Scotia; but although he took
great interest in colonial matters, and had used every effort to
advocate the more generous political system which had colonial
self-government for its goal, he decided not to abandon his
beloved Examiner even for so sympathetic an employment. In
1847, however, domestic reasons induced him to accept the post
of statistical secretary of the Board of Trade. This of course
compelled him to resign the editorship of the Examiner, but he
still continued to contribute largely to the paper, which, under the
control of John Forster, continued to sustain its influential
position. During the later years of his life Fonblanque took no
prominent part in public affairs; and when he died at the age of
seventy-nine (1872) he seemed, as his nephew, Edward Fonblanque,
rightly observes, &ldquo;a man who had lived and toiled in an age gone
by and in a cause long since established.&rdquo;

The character of Albany Fonblanque&rsquo;s political activity may
be judged of by a study of his England under Seven Administrations
(1837), in comparison with the course of social and political
events in England from 1826 to 1837. As a journalist, he must
be regarded in the light of a reformer. Journalism before his
day was regarded as a somewhat discreditable profession; men
of true culture were shy of entering the hot and dusty arena lest
they should be confounded with the ruder combatants who fought
there before the public for hire. But the fact that Fonblanque,
a man not only of strong and earnest political convictions but
also of exceptional literary ability, did not hesitate to choose this
field as a worthy one in which both a politician and a man of
letters might usefully as well as honourably put forth his best
gifts, must have helped, in no small degree, to correct the old
prejudice.

nephew, Edward Barrington de Fonblanque (London, 1874); a
collection of his articles with a brief biographical notice.




FOND DU LAC, a city and the county-seat of Fond du Lac
county, Wisconsin, U.S.A., about 60 m. N. of Milwaukee, at the
S. end of Lake Winnebago, and at the mouth of the Fond du
Lac river, which is navigable for only a short distance. Pop.
(1890) 12,024; (1900) 15,110, of whom 2952 were foreign-born;
(1910) 18,797. The city is a railway centre of some importance,
and is served by the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St Paul, the
Minneapolis, St Paul &amp; Sault St Marie, and the Chicago &amp; North-Western
railways, by interurban electric lines, and by steamboat
lines connecting through the Fox river with vessels on the Great
Lakes. At North Fond du Lac, just beyond the city limits,
are car-shops of the two last-mentioned railways, and in the
city are manufactories of machinery, automobiles, wagons
and carriages, awnings, leather, beer, flour, refrigerators, agricultural
implements, toys and furniture. The total value of the
city&rsquo;s factory products in 1905 was $5,599,606, an increase of
95.7% since 1900. The city has a Protestant Episcopal
cathedral, the Grafton Hall school for girls, and St Agnes hospital
and convent, and a public library with about 25,000 volumes in
1908. The first settlers on the site of Fond du Lac arrived about
1835. Subsequently a village was laid out which was incorporated
in 1847; a city charter was secured in 1852.



FONDI (anc. Fundi), a town of Campania, Italy, in the
province of Caserta, 12 m. N.W. of Formia, and 11 m. E.N.E.
of Terracina by road. Pop. (1901) 9930. It lies 25 ft. above
sea-level, at the N. end of a plain surrounded by mountains,
which extend to the sea. It occupies the site of the ancient
Fundi, a Volscian town, belonging later to Latium adjectum, on
the Via Appia, still represented by the modern high-road which
passes through the centre of the town. It is rectangular in plan,
and portions of its walls, partly in fine polygonal work and partly
in opus incertum, are preserved. Both plan and walls date, no
doubt, from the Roman period. The gate on the north-east still
exists, and bears the inscription of three aediles who erected the
gate, the towers and the wall. A similar inscription of three
different aediles from the N.W. gate still exists, but not in situ.
In the neighbourhood are the remains of several ancient villas,
and along the Via Appia still stands an ancient wall of opus
reticulatum, with an inscription, in large letters, of one Varronianus,
the letters being at intervals of 25 ft. The engineering of
the ancient Via Appia between Fondi and Formia, where it
passes through the mountains near Itri, is remarkable.

The modern town is still enclosed by the ancient walls. The
castle on the S.E. side has some 15th-century windows with
beautiful tracery. Close by is the Gothic church of S. Pietro
(formerly S. Maria), which was the cathedral until the see was
suppressed in 1818 and united with that of Gaeta; it contains
a fine pulpit with &ldquo;cosmatesque&rdquo; work and the fine tomb of
Cristoforo Caetani (1439), two interesting 15th-century triptychs
and an episcopal throne, which served for the coronation of the
anti-pope Clement VII. in 1378. In the Dominican monastery
the cell which St Thomas Aquinas sometimes occupied is shown.

The ancient city of Fundi in 338 B.C. (or 332) received (with
Formiae) the civitas sine suffragio, because it had always secured
the Romans safe passage through its territory; the people
as a whole did not join Privernum in its war against Rome three
years later, though Vitruvius Vacca, the leader, was a native of
Fundi. It acquired the full citizenship in 188 B.C., and was
partly under the control of a praefectus. The inscription upon
some waterpipes which have been discovered shows that later it
became a municipium. It was governed by three aediles:
Horace&rsquo;s jest against the officious praetor (sic) is due to the
exigencies of metre (Th. Mommsen in Hermes, xiii. p. 113). The
family of Livia, the consort of Augustus, belonged to Fundi.
During the Lombard invasions in 592 Fundi was temporarily
abandoned, but it seems to have come under the rule of the
papacy by A.D. 754 at any rate. Pope John VIII. ceded it with
its territory to Docibile, duke of Gaeta, but its history is somewhat
intricate after this period. Sometimes it appears as an
independent countship, though held by members of the Caetani
family, who about 1297 returned to it. In 1504 it was given to
Prospero Colonna. In 1534 Khair-ed-Din Barbarossa tried to
carry off Giulia Gonzaga, countess of Fondi, and sacked the city.
After this Fondi was much neglected; in 1721 it was sold to the
Di Sangro family, in which it still remains. Its position as a
frontier town between the papal states and the kingdom of
Naples, just in the territory of the latter&mdash;the Via Appia can
easily be blocked either N.W. at the actual frontier called
604
Portella1 or S.E. of it&mdash;affected it a good deal during the French
Revolution and the events which led up to the unification of
Italy.

The Lago di Fondi, which lies in the middle of the plain, and
the partially drained marshes surrounding it, compelled the
ancient Via Appia, followed by the modern road, to make a
considerable dÃ©tour. The lake was also known in classical times
ass, lacus Amyclanu from the town of Amyclae or Amunclae,
which was founded, according to legend, by Spartan colonists,
and probably destroyed by the Oscans in the 5th century B.C.
(E. Pais in Rendiconti dei Lincei, 1906, 611 seq.); the bay was
also known as mare Amunclanum.

The ancient Speluncae (mod. Sperlonga) on the coast also
belonged to the territory of Fundi. Here was the imperial villa
in which Sejanus saved the life of Tiberius, who was almost
crushed by a fall of rock. Considerable remains of it, and of the
caves from which it took its name, still exist 1 m. S.E. of the
modern village. For modern discoveries see P. di Tucci in
Notizie degli scavi (1880), 480; G. Patroni, ibid. (1898), 493.
The wine of Fundi is spoken of by ancient writers, though the
ager Caecubus, the coast plain round the Lago di Fundi, was even
more renowned, and Horace frequently praises its wine; and
though Pliny the Elder speaks as if its production had almost
entirely ceased in his day (attributing this to neglect, but even
more to the excavation works of Nero&rsquo;s projected canal from the
lacus Avernus to Ostia), Martial mentions it often, and it is
spoken of in the inscription of a wine-dealer of the time of
Hadrian, together with Falernian and Setian wines (Corpus
inscript. Lat. vi. Berlin, 1882, 9797). The plain of Fondi is the
northernmost point in Italy where the cultivation of oranges and
lemons is regularly carried on in modern times.

FONNI, a town of Sardinia, in the province of Sassari, 3280 ft.
above sea-level, to the N.W. of Monte Gennargentu, 21 m. S.
of Nuoro by road. Pop. (1901) 4323. It is the highest village
in Sardinia, and situated among fine scenery with some chestnut
woods. The church of the Franciscans, built in 1708, contains
some curious paintings by local artists. The costumes are extremely
picturesque, and are well seen on the day of St John the
Baptist, the patron saint. The men&rsquo;s costume is similar to that
worn in the district generally; the linen trousers are long and
black gaiters are worn. The women wear a white chemise;
over that a very small corselet, and over that a red jacket with
blue and black velvet facings. The skirt is brown above and
red below, with a blue band between the two colours; it is
accordion-pleated. Two identical skirts are often worn, one
above the other. The unmarried girls wear white kerchiefs,
the married women black. A little to the N. of Fonni, by the
high-road, stood the Roman station of Sorabile, mentioned in
the Antonine Itinerary as situated 87 m. from Carales on the
road to Olbia. Excavations made in 1879 and 1880 led to the
discovery of the remains of this station, arranged round three
sides of a courtyard some 100 ft. square, including traces of
baths and other buildings, and a massive embanking wall above
them, some 150 ft. in length, to protect them from landslips
(F. Vivanet, in Notizie degli scavi, 1879, 350; 1881, 31), while
a discharge certificate (tabula honestae missionis) of sailors
who had served in the classis Ravennas was found in some
ruins here or hereabouts (id. ib., 1882, 440; T. Mommsen,
Corp. inscr. Lat. x. 8325). Near Fonni, too, are several
&ldquo;menhirs&rdquo; (called pietre celtiche in the district) and other
prehistoric remains.

FONSAGRADA, a town of north-western Spain, in the province
of Lugo; 25 m. E.N.E. of Lugo by road. Pop. (1900) 17,302.
Fonsagrada is situated 3166 ft. above the sea, on the watershed
between the rivers Rodil and Suarna. It is an important market
for all kinds of agricultural produce, and manufactures linen and
frieze; but its trade is mainly local, owing to the mountainous
character of the neighbourhood, and the lack of a railway or
navigable waterway, which prevent the development of any
considerable export trade.



FONSECA, MANOEL DEODORO DA (1827-1892), first
president of the united states of Brazil, was born at Alagoas
on the 5th of August 1827, being the third son of Lieut.-Colonel
Manoel Mendes da Fonseca (d. 1859). He was educated at
the military school of Rio de Janeiro, and had attained the rank
of captain in the Brazilian army when war broke out in 1864
against Montevideo, and afterwards against Solano Lopez,
dictator of Paraguay. His courage gained him distinction, and
before the close of the war in 1870 he reached the rank of colonel,
and some years later that of general of division. After holding
several military commands, he was appointed in 1886 governor
of the province of Rio Grande do Sul. In this position he threw
himself heartily into politics, espoused the republican opinions
then becoming prevalent, and sheltered their exponents with
his authority. After a fruitless remonstrance, the government
at the close of the year removed him from his post, and recalled
him to the capital as director of the service of army material.
Finding that even in that post he still continued to encourage
insubordination, the minister of war, Alfredo Chaves, dismissed
him from office. On 14th of May 1887, in conjunction with the
viscount de Pelotas, Fonseca issued a manifesto in defence of
the military officers&rsquo; political rights. From that time his influence
was supreme in the army. In December 1888, when the Conservative
Correa d&rsquo;Oliveira became prime minister, Fonseca was
appointed to command an army corps on the frontier of Matto
Grosso. In June 1889 the ministry was overthrown, and on a
dissolution an overwhelming Liberal majority was returned to
the chamber of deputies. Fonseca returned to the capital in
September. Divisions of opinion soon arose within the Liberal
party on the question of provincial autonomy. The more
extreme desired the inauguration of a complete federal system.
Amongst the most vehement was Ruy Barbosa, the journalist
and orator, and after some difficulty he persuaded Fonseca to
head an armed movement against the government. The insurrection
broke out on the 15th of November 1889. The government
commander, Almeida Barreto, hastened to place himself
under Fonseca&rsquo;s orders, and the soldiers and sailors made
common cause with the insurgents. The affair was almost
bloodless, the minister of marine, baron de Ladario, being the
only person wounded. Fonseca had only intended to overturn
the ministry, but he yielded to the insistency of the republican,
leaders and proclaimed a republic. A provisional government
was constituted by the army and navy in the name of the nation,
with Fonseca at its head. The council was abolished, and both
the senate and the chamber of deputies were dissolved. The
emperor was requested to leave the territory of Brazil within
twenty-four hours, and on the 17th of November was embarked
on a cruiser for Lisbon. On the 20th of December a decree of
banishment was pronounced against the imperial family. So
universal was the republican sentiment that there was no attempt
at armed resistance. The provisional government exercised
dictatorial powers for a year, and on the 25th of February 1891
Fonseca was elected president of the republic. He was, however,
no politician, and possessed indeed little ability beyond the art
of acquiring popularity. His tenure of office was short. In
May he became involved in an altercation with congress, and in
November pronounced its dissolution, a measure beyond his
constitutional power. After a few days of arbitrary rule insurrection
broke out in Rio Grande do Sul, and before the close of
November Fonseca, finding himself forsaken, resigned his office.
From that time he lived in retirement. He died at Rio de
Janeiro on the 23rd of August 1892.



FONSECA, Amapala or Conchagua, BAY OF, an inlet of the
Pacific Ocean in the volcanic region between the Central American
republics of Honduras, Salvador and Nicaragua. The bay is
unsurpassed in extent and security by any other harbour on
the Pacific. It is upwards of 50 m. in greatest length, by about
30 m. in average width, with an entrance from the sea about
18 m. wide, between the great volcanoes of Conchagua (3800 ft.)
605
and Coseguina (3000 ft.). The lofty islands of Conchaguita
and Mianguiri, with a collection of rocks called &ldquo;Los Farellones,&rdquo;
divide the entrance into four distinct channels, each of sufficient
depth for the largest vessels. A channel called &ldquo;El Estero
Real&rdquo; extends from the extreme southern point of the bay into
Nicaragua for about 50 m., reaching within 20 or 25 m. of Lake
Managua. The principal islands in the bay are Sacate Grande,
Tigre, Gueguensi and Esposescion belonging to Honduras,
and Martin Perez, Punta Sacate, Conchaguita and Mianguiri
belonging to Salvador. Of these Sacate Grande is the largest,
being about 7 m. long by 4 broad. The island of Tigre from its
position is the most important in the bay, being about 20 m.
in circumference, and rising in a cone to the height of 2500 ft.
On the southern and eastern shores of the island the lava forms
black rocky barriers to the waves, varying in height from 10
to 80 ft.; but on the northward and eastward are a number
of playas or smooth, sandy beaches. Facing one of the most
considerable of these is the port of Amapala (q.v.). Fonseca
Bay was discovered in 1522 by Gil Gonzalez de Avila, and named
by him after his patron, Archbishop Juan Fonseca, the implacable
enemy of Columbus.



FONT (Lat. fons, &ldquo;fountain&rdquo; or &ldquo;spring,&rdquo; Ital. fonte, Fr.
les fonts), the vessel used in churches to hold the water for
Christian baptism. In the apostolic period baptism was administered
at rivers or natural springs (cf. Acts viii. 36), and no
doubt the primitive form of the rite was by immersion in the
water. Infusion&mdash;pouring water on the head of the neophyte&mdash;was
early introduced into the west and north of Europe on
account of the inconvenience of immersion, as well as its occasional
danger; this form has never been countenanced in the Oriental
churches. Aspersion, or sprinkling, was also admitted as valid,
but recorded early examples of its use are rare (see Baptism).
These different modes of administering baptism have caused
corresponding changes in the receptacles for the water. After
the cessation of persecution, when ritual and ornament began
to develop openly, special buildings were erected for administering
the rite of baptism. This was obviously necessary, for a large
piscina (basin or tank) in which candidates could be immersed
would occupy too much space of the church floor itself. These
baptisteries consisted of tanks entered by steps (an ascent of
three, and descent of four, to the water was the normal but not
the invariable number) and covered with a domed chamber
(see Baptistery).

By the 9th century, however, the use of separate baptisteries
had generally given place to that of fonts. The material of
which these were made was stone, often decorative marble;
as early as 524, however, the council of Lerida enacted that if a
stone font were not procurable the presbyter was to provide
a suitable vessel, to be used for the sacrament exclusively, which
might be of any material. In the Eastern Church the font
never became an important decorative article of church furniture:
&ldquo;The font, &#954;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#942;&#952;&#961;&#945; (says Neale, Eastern Church, i. 214), in
the Eastern Church is a far less conspicuous object than it is in
the West. Baptism by immersion has been retained; but the
font seldom or never possesses any beauty. The material is
usually either metal or wood. In Russia the columbethra is
movable and only brought out when wanted.&rdquo;

One of the most elaborate of early fonts is that described by
Anastasius in the Lateran church at Rome, and said to have been
presented thereto by Constantine the Great. It was of porphyry,
overlaid with silver inside and out. In the middle were two
porphyry pillars carrying a golden dish, on which burnt the
Paschal lamp (having an asbestos wick and fed with balsam).
On the rim of the bowl was a golden lamb, with silver statues
of Christ and St. John the Baptist. Seven silver stags poured
out water. This elaborate vessel was of course exceptional;
the majority of early fonts were certainly much simpler. A fine
early Byzantine stone example exists, or till recently existed,
at Beer-Sheba.

Few if any fonts survive older than the 11th century. These
are all of stone, except a few of lead; much less common are
fonts of cast bronze (a fine example, dated 1112, exists at the
Church of St BarthÃ©lemy, LiÃ©ge). The most ancient are plain
cylindrical bowls, with a circular&mdash;sometimes cruciform or
quatrefoil&mdash;outline to the basin, either without support or with
a single central pillar; occasionally there is more than one pillar.
The basins are usually lined with lead to prevent absorption
by the stone. The church of Efenechtyd, Denbigh, possesses
an ancient font made of a single block of oak. Though the
circular form is the commonest, early Romanesque fonts are not
infrequently square; and sometimes an inverted truncated cone
is found. Octagonal fonts are also known, though uncommon;
hexagons are even less common, and pentagons very rare.
There is a pentagonal font of this period at Cabourg, dept.
Calvados, N. France.

Fonts early began to be decorated with sculpture and relief.
Arcading and interlacing work are common; so are symbol and
pictorial representation. A very remarkable leaden font is
preserved at Strassburg, bearing reliefs representing scenes in
the life of Christ. At Pont-Ã -Mousson on the Moselle are bas-reliefs
of St John the Baptist preaching, and baptizing Christ.
Caryatides sometimes take the place of the pillars, and sculptured
animals and grotesques of strange design not infrequently
form the base. More remarkable is the occasional persistence
of pagan symbolism; an interesting example is the very ancient
font from Ottrava, Sweden, which, among a series of Christian
symbols and figures on its panels, bears a representation of Thor
(see G. Stephens&rsquo; brochure, Thunor the Thunderer).

In the 13th century octagonal fonts became commoner. A
very remarkable example exists at the cathedral of Hildesheim
in Hanover, resting on four kneeling figures, each bearing a vase
from which water is running (typical of the rivers of Paradise).
Above is an inscription explaining the connexion of these rivers
with the virtues of temperance, courage, justice and prudence.
On the sides of the cup are representations of the passage of the
Jordan, of the Red Sea, the Baptism of Christ, and the Virgin
and Child. The font has a conical lid, also ornamented with
bas-reliefs. A cast of this font is to be seen in the Victoria and
Albert Museum at South Kensington. A leaden font, with figures
of Our Lord, the Virgin Mary, St Martin, and the twelve Apostles,
exists at Mainz; it is dated 1328 by a set of four leonine hexameters
inscribed upon it. In the 14th and succeeding centuries
octagonal fonts became the rule. They are delicately ornamented
with mouldings and similar decorations, in the contemporary
style of Gothic architectural art. Though the basin is usually
circular in 15th-century fonts, examples are not infrequently
found in which the outline of the basin follows the octagonal
shape of the outer surface of the vessel. Examples of this type
are to be found at Strassburg, Freiburg and Basel.

In England no fonts can certainly be said to date before the
Norman conquest, although it is possible that a few very rude
examples, such as those of Washaway, Cornwall, and Denton,
Sussex, are actually of Saxon times; of course we cannot count
as &ldquo;Saxon fonts&rdquo; those adapted from pre-Norman sculptured
stones originally designed for other purposes, such as that at
Dolton, Devonshire. On the other hand, Norman fonts are very
common, and are often the sole surviving relics of the Norman
parish church. They are circular or square, sometimes plain,
but generally covered with carving of arcades, figures, foliage,
&amp;c. Among good examples that might be instanced of this
period are Alphington, Devon (inverted cone, without foot);
Stoke Cannon, Devon (supported on caryatides); Ilam, Staffs
(cup-shaped); Fincham, Burnham Deepdale, Sculthorpe,
Toftrees, and Shernborne in Norfolk (all, especially the last,
remarkable for elaborate carving); Youlgrave, Derby (with a
projecting stoup in the side for the chrism&mdash;a unique detail);
besides others in Lincoln cathedral; Iffley, Oxon; Newenden,
Kent; Coleshill, Warwick; East Meon, Hants; Castle Frome,
Herefordshire. Some of the best examples of &ldquo;Norman&rdquo;
fonts in England (such as the notable specimen in Winchester
cathedral) were probably imported from Belgium. In the
Transitional period we may mention a remarkable octagonal font
at Belton, Lincolnshire; in this period fall most of the leaden
fonts that remain in England, of which thirty are known (7 in
606
Gloucestershire, 4 in Berkshire and Kent, 3 in Norfolk, Oxford
and Sussex, 1 in Derby, Dorset, Lincoln, Somerset, Surrey and
Wiltshire); perhaps the finest examples are at Ashover, Derbyshire,
and Walton, Surrey. Early English fonts are comparatively
rare. They bear the moulding, foliage and tooth
ornament in the usual style of the period. A good example of
an Early English font is at All Saints, Leicester; others may be
seen at St Giles&rsquo;, Oxford, and at Lackford, Suffolk. Fonts of the
Decorated period are commoner, but not so frequent as those of
the preceding Norman or subsequent Perpendicular periods.
Fonts of the Perpendicular period are very common, and are
generally raised upon steps and a lofty stem, which, together with
the body of the font, are frequently richly ornamented with
panelling. It was also the custom during this period to ornament
the font with shields and coats of arms and other heraldic
insignia, as at Herne, Kent. The fonts of this period, however,
are as a rule devoid of interest, and, like most Perpendicular
work, are stiff and monotonous. There is, however, a remarkable
font, with sculptured figures, belonging to the late 14th century,
at West Drayton in Middlesex.

In Holyrood chapel there was a brazen font in which the royal
children of Scotland were baptized. It was carried off in 1544
by Sir R. Lea, and given by him to the church at St Albans,
but was afterwards destroyed by the Puritans. A silver font
existed at Canterbury, which was sometimes brought to Westminster
on the occasion of a royal baptism. At Chobham,
Surrey, there is a leaden font covered with oaken panels of the
16th century. The only existing structure at all recalling the
ancient baptisteries in English churches is found at Luton in
Bedfordshire. The font at Luton belongs to the Decorated
style, and is enclosed in an octagonal structure of freestone,
consisting of eight pillars about 25 ft. in height, supporting a
canopy. The space around the font is large enough to hold
twelve adults comfortably. At the top of the canopy is a vessel
for containing the consecrated water, which when required was
let down into the font by means of a pipe.

In 1236 it was ordered by Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury,
that baptismal fonts should be kept under lock and key, as a
precaution against sorcery:&mdash;&ldquo;Fontes baptismales sub sera
clausi teneantur propter sortilegia.&rdquo; The lids appear at first to
have been quite simple and flat. They gradually, however,
partook of the ornamentation of the font itself, and are often
of pyramidal and conical forms, highly decorated with finials,
crockets, mouldings and grotesques. Sometimes these covers are
very heavy and are suspended by chains to enable them to be
raised at will. Very rich font covers may be seen at Ewelme,
Oxon; St Gregory, Sudbury; North Walsingham, Norfolk;
Worlingworth, Suffolk. The ordinary position of the font in
the church was and is near the entrance, usually to the left of
the south door.

FONTAINE, PIERRE FRANÃ‡OIS LÃ‰ONARD (1762-1853),
French architect, was born at Pontoise on the 20th of September
1762. He came of a family several of whose members had distinguished
themselves as architects. Leaving the college of
Pontoise at the age of sixteen he was sent to L&rsquo;Isle-Adam to
assist in hydraulic works undertaken by the architect AndrÃ©.
To facilitate his improvement AndrÃ© allowed him to have access
to his plans and to copy his designs. In October 1779 he was
sent to Paris to study in the school of Peyre the younger, and
there began his acquaintance with Percier, which ripened into
a life-long friendship. After six years of study he competed
for a prize at the Academy, and, winning the second for the plan
of an underground chapel, he received a pension and was sent
to Rome (1785). Percier accompanied him. The Revolution
breaking out soon after his return to France, he took refuge in
England; but after the establishment of the consulate he was
employed by Bonaparte, to whom he had been introduced by
the painter, David, to restore the palace of Malmaison. Henceforth
he was fully engaged in the principal architectural works
executed in Paris as architect successively to Napoleon I.,
Louis XVIII. and Louis Philippe. In conjunction with Percier
(till his death) he was employed on the arch of the Carrousel,
the restoration of the Palais-Royal, the grand staircase of the
Louvre, and the works projected for the union of the Louvre and
the Tuileries. In 1812 he was admitted a member of the Academy
of Fine Arts, and in 1813 was named first architect to the
emperor. With Percier he published the following works&mdash;Palais,
maisons, et autres Ã©difices de Rome moderne (1802);
Descriptions de cÃ©rÃ©monies et de fÃªtes (1807 and 1810); Recueil
de dÃ©corations intÃ©rieures (1812); Choix des plus cÃ©lÃ¨bres maisons
de plaisance de Rome et des environs (1809-1813); RÃ©sidences
des souverains, ParallÃ¨le (1833). L&rsquo;histoire du Palais-Royal was
published by Fontaine alone, who lost Percier, his friend and
associate, in 1838, and himself died in Paris on the 10th of
October 1853.



FONTAINEBLEAU, a town of northern France, capital of an
arrondissement in the department of Seine-et-Marne, 37 m. S.E.
of Paris on the railway to Lyons. Pop. (1906) 11,108. Fontainebleau,
a town of clean, wide and well-built streets, stands in the
midst of the forest of Fontainebleau, nearly 2 m. from the left
bank of the Seine. Of its old houses, the Tambour mansion, and
a portion of that which belonged to the cardinal of Ferrara,
both of the 16th century, are still preserved; apart from the
palace, the public buildings are without interest. A statue of
General Damesme (d. 1848) stands in the principal square, and a
monument to President Carnot was erected in 1895. Fontainebleau
is the seat of a subprefect and has a tribunal of first
instance and a communal college. The school of practical
artillery and engineering was transferred to Fontainebleau from
Metz by a decree of 1871, and now occupies the part of the palace
surrounding the cour des offices.

Fontainebleau has quarries of sand and sandstone, saw-mills,
and manufactories of porcelain and gloves. Fine grapes are
grown in the vicinity. The town is a fashionable summer resort,
and during the season the president of the Republic frequently
resides in the palace. This famous building, one of the largest,
and in the interior one of the most sumptuous, of the royal
residences of France, lies immediately to the south-east of the
town. It consists of a series of courts surrounded by buildings,
extending from W. to E.N.E.; they comprise the Cour du
Cheval Blanc or des Adieux (thus named in memory of the parting
scene between Napoleon and the Old Guard in 1814), the Cour
de la Fontaine, the Cour Ovale, built on the site of a more
ancient chÃ¢teau, and the Cour d&rsquo; Henri IV.: the smaller Cour
des Princes adjoins the northern wing of the Cour Ovale. The
exact origin of the palace and of its name (Lat. Fons Bleaudi)
are equally unknown, but the older chÃ¢teau was used in the
latter part of the 12th century by Louis VII., who caused Thomas
Becket to consecrate the Chapelle St Saturnin, and it continued
a favourite residence of Philip Augustus and Louis IX. The
creator of the present edifice was Francis I., under whom the
architect Gilles le Breton erected most of the buildings of the
Cour Ovale, including the Porte DorÃ©e, its southern entrance,
and the Salle des FÃªtes, which, in the reign of Henry II., was
decorated by the Italians, Francesco Primaticcio and Nicolo
dell&rsquo; Abbate, and is perhaps the finest Renaissance chamber in
France. The Galerie de FranÃ§ois I. and the lower storey of the
left wing of the Cour de la Fontaine are the work of the same
architect, who also rebuilt the two-storeyed Chapelle St Saturnin.
In the same reign the Cour du Cheval Blanc, including the
Chapelle de la Ste TrinitÃ© and the Galerie d&rsquo;Ulysse, destroyed
and rebuilt under Louis XV., was constructed by Pierre
Chambiges. After Francis I., Fontainebleau owes most to Henry
IV., to whom are due the Cour d&rsquo; Henri IV., the Cour des Princes,
with the adjoining Galerie de Diane, and Galerie des Cerfs, used
as a library. Louis XIII. built the graceful horseshoe staircase
in the Cour du Cheval Blanc; Napoleon I. spent 12,000,000 francs
607
on works of restoration, and Louis XVIII., Louis Philippe and
Napoleon III. devoted considerable sums to the same end. The
palace is surrounded by gardens and ornamental waters&mdash;to the
north the Jardin de l&rsquo;Orangerie, to the south the Jardin Anglais
and the Parterre, between which extends the lake known as the
Bassin des Carpes, containing carp in large numbers. A space
of over 200 acres to the east of the palace is covered by the park,
which is traversed by a canal dating from the reign of Henry IV.
On the north the park is bordered by a vinery producing fine
white grapes.

Forest of Fontainebleau.&mdash;The forest of Fontainebleau is one
of the most beautiful wooded tracts in France, and for generations
it has been the chosen haunt of French landscape painters.
Among the most celebrated spots are the VallÃ©e de la Solle,
the Gorge aux Loups, the Gorges de Franchard and d&rsquo;Apremont,
and the Fort l&rsquo;Empereur. The whole area extends to 42,200
acres, with a circumference of 56 m. Nearly a quarter of this
area is of a rocky nature, and the quarries of sandstone supplied
a large part of the paving of Paris. The oak, pine, beech, hornbeam
and birch are the chief varieties of trees.

It is impossible to do more than mention a few of the historical
events which have taken place at Fontainebleau. Philip the
Fair, Henry III. and Louis XIII. were all born in the palace,
and the first of these kings died there. James V. of Scotland
was there received by his intended bride; and Charles V. of
Germany was entertained there in 1539. Christina of Sweden
lived there for years, and the gallery is still to be seen where in
1657 she caused her secretary Monaldeschi to be put to death.
In 1685 Fontainebleau saw the signing of the revocation of
the edict of Nantes, and in the following year the death of the
great CondÃ©. In the 18th century it had two illustrious guests
in Peter the Great of Russia and Christian VII. of Denmark;
and in the early part of the 19th century it was twice the residence
of Pius VII.,&mdash;in 1804 when he came to consecrate the emperor
Napoleon, and in 1812-1814, when he was his prisoner.

FONTAN, LOUIS MARIE (1801-1839), French man of letters,
was born at Lorient on the 4th of November 1801. He began
his career as a clerk in a government office, but was dismissed
for taking part in a political banquet. At the age of nineteen
he went to Paris and began to contribute to the Tablettes and
the Album. He was brought to trial for political articles written
for the latter paper, but defended himself so energetically that
he secured the indefinite postponement of his case. The offending
paper was suppressed for a time, and Fontan produced a collection
of political poems, Odes et Ã©pÃ®tres, and a number of plays, of
which Perkins Warbec (1828), written in collaboration with
MM. HalÃ©vy and Drouineau, was the most successful. In 1828
the Album was revived, and in it Fontan published a virulent
but witty attack on Charles X., entitled Le Mouton enragÃ©
(20th June 1829). To escape the inevitable prosecution Fontan
fled over the frontier, but, finding no safe asylum, he returned
to Paris to give himself up to the authorities, and was sentenced
to five years&rsquo; imprisonment and a heavy fine. He was liberated
by the revolution of 1830, and his Jeanne la folle, performed in
the same year, gained a success due perhaps more to sympathy
with the author&rsquo;s political principles than to the merits of the
piece itself, a somewhat crude and violent picture of Breton
history. A drama representing the trial of Marshal Ney, which
he wrote in collaboration with Charles Dupenty, Le ProcÃ¨s d&rsquo;un
marÃ©chal de France (printed 1831), was suppressed on the
night of its production. Fontan died in Paris on the 10th of
October 1839.


A sympathetic portrait of Fontan as a prisoner, and an analysis
of his principal works, are to be found in Jules Janin&rsquo;s Histoire de la
littÃ©rature dramatique, vol. i.




FONTANA, DOMENICO (1543-1607), Italian architect and
mechanician, was born at Mili, a village on the Lake of Como, in
1543. After a good training in mathematics, he went in 1563
to join his elder brother, then studying architecture at Rome.
He made rapid progress, and was taken into the service of
Cardinal Montalto, for whom he erected a chapel in the church of
Santa Maria Maggiore and the villa Negroni. When the cardinal&rsquo;s
pension was stopped by the pope, Gregory XIII., Fontana
volunteered to complete the works in hand at his own expense.
The cardinal being soon after elected pope, under the name of
Sixtus V., he immediately appointed Fontana his chief architect.
Amongst the works executed by him were the Lateran palace,
the palace of Monte Cavallo (the Quirinal), the Vatican library,
&amp;c. But the undertaking which brought Fontana the highest
repute was the removal of the great Egyptian obelisk, which
had been brought to Rome in the reign of Caligula, from the place
where it lay in the circus of the Vatican. Its erection in front
of St Peter&rsquo;s he accomplished in 1586. After the death of Sixtus
V., charges were brought against Fontana of misappropriation
of public moneys, and Clement VIII. dismissed him from his
post (1592). This appears to have been just in time to save
the Colosseum from being converted by Fontana into a huge
cloth factory, according to a project of Sixtus V. Fontana was
then called to Naples, and accepted the appointment of architect
to the viceroy, the count of Miranda. At Naples he built the
royal palace, constructed several canals and projected a new
harbour and bridge, which he did not live to execute. The only
literary work left by him is his account of the removal of the
obelisk (Rome, 1590). He died at Naples in 1607, and was
honoured with a public funeral in the church of Santa Anna.
His plan for a new harbour at Naples was carried out only after
his death. His son Giulio Cesare succeeded him as royal architect
in Naples, the university of that town being his best-known
building.



FONTANA, LAVINIA (1552-1614), Italian portrait-painter,
was the daughter of Prospero Fontana (q.v.). She was greatly
employed by the ladies of Bologna, and, going thence to Rome,
painted the likenesses of many illustrious personages, being under
the particular patronage of the family (Buoncampagni) of Pope
Gregory XIII., who died in 1585. The Roman ladies, from the
days of this pontiff to those of Paul V., elected in 1605, showed
no less favour to Lavinia than their Bolognese sisters had done;
and Paul V. was himself among her sitters. Some of her portraits,
often lavishly paid for, have been attributed to Guido. In works
of a different kind also she united care and delicacy with boldness.
Among the chief of these are a Venus in the Berlin museum;
the &ldquo;Virgin lifting a veil from the sleeping infant Christ,&rdquo; in the
Escorial; and the &ldquo;Queen of Sheba visiting Solomon.&rdquo; Her
own portrait in youth&mdash;she was accounted very beautiful&mdash;was
perhaps her masterpiece; it belongs to the counts Zappi of
Imola, the family into which Lavinia married. Her husband,
whose name is given as Paolo Zappi or Paolo Foppa, painted the
draperies in many of Lavinia&rsquo;s pictures. She is deemed on the
whole a better painter than her father; from him naturally
came her first instruction, but she gradually adopted the Caraccesque
style, with strong quasi-Venetian colouring. She was
elected into the Academy of Rome, and died in that city in 1614.



FONTANA, PROSPERO (1512-1597), Italian painter, was
born in Bologna, and became a pupil of Innocenzo da Imola.
He afterwards worked for Vasari and Perino del Vaga. It was
probably from Vasari that Fontana acquired a practice of offhand,
self-displaying work. He undertook a multitude of commissions,
and was so rapid, that he painted, it is said, in a few
weeks an entire hall in the Vitelli palace at CittÃ  di Castello.
Along with daring, he had fertility of combination, and in works
of parade he attained a certain measure of success, although his
drawing was incorrect and his mannerism palpable. He belongs
to the degenerate period of the Bolognese school, under the
influence chiefly of the imitators of Raphael&mdash;Sabbatini, Sammachini
and Passerotti being three of his principal colleagues.
His soundest successes were in portraiture, in which branch of
art he stood so high that towards 1550 Michelangelo introduced
him to Pope Julius III. as a portrait-painter; and he was
pensioned by this pope, and remained at the pontifical court
with the three successors of Julius. Here he lived on a grand
scale, and figured as a sort of arbiter and oracle among his
608
professional brethren. Returning to Bologna, after doing some
work in Fontainebleau and in Genoa, he opened a school of art,
in which he became the preceptor of Lodovico and Agostino
Caracci; but these pupils, standing forth as reformers and
innovators, finally extinguished the academy and the vogue of
Fontana. His subjects were in the way of sacred and profane
history and of fable. He has left a large quantity of work in
Bologna,&mdash;the picture of the &ldquo;Adoration of the Magi,&rdquo; in the
church of S. Maria delle Grazie, being considered his masterpiece&mdash;not
unlike the style of Paul Veronese. He died in Rome in
1597.



FONTANE, THEODOR (1819-1898), German poet and novelist,
was born at Neu-Ruppin on the 30th of December 1819. At
the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to a chemist, and after
qualifying as an apothecary, he found employment in Leipzig
and Dresden. In 1844 he travelled in England, and settling
in Berlin devoted himself from 1849 to literature. He made
repeated journeys to England, interesting himself in old English
ballads, and as the first fruits of his tours published Ein Sommer
in London (1854); Aus England, Studien und Briefe (1860) and
Jenseit des Tweed, Bilder und Briefe aus Schottland (1860).
Fontane was particularly attached to the Mark of Brandenburg,
in which his home lay; he was proud of its past achievements,
and delighted in the growth of the capital city, Berlin. The
fascination which the country of his birth had for him may be
seen in his delightfully picturesque Wanderungen durch die Mark
Brandenburg (1862-1882, 4 vols.). He also described the wars of
Prussia in Der schleswig-holsteinische Krieg im Jahre 1864 (1866)
and Der deutsche Krieg von 1866 (1869). He proceeded to the
theatre of war in 1870, and, being taken prisoner at Vaucouleurs,
remained three months in captivity. His experiences he narrates
in Kriegsgefangen. Erlebtes 1870 (1871), and he published the
result of his observations of the campaign in Der Krieg gegen
Frankreich 1870-71 (1874-1876). Like most of his contemporaries,
he at first sought inspiration for his poetry in the heroes
of other countries. His Gedichte (1851) and ballads Manner und
Helden (1860) tell of England&rsquo;s glories in bygone days. Then the
achievements of his own countrymen entered into rivalry, and
these, as an ardent patriot, he immortalized in poem and narrative.
It is, however, as a novelist that Fontane is best known.
His fine historical romance Vor dem Sturm (1878) was followed
by a series of novels of modern life: L&rsquo;Adultera (1882); Schach
von Wuthenow (1883); Irrungen, Wirrungen (1888); Stine (1890);
Unwiederbringlich (1891); Effi Briest (1895); Der Stechlin (1899),
in which with fine literary tact Fontane adapted the realistic
methods and social criticism of contemporary French fiction to
the conditions of Prussian life. He died on the 20th of September
1898 at Berlin.


Fontane&rsquo;s Gesammelte Romane und ErzÃ¤hlungen were published in
12 vols. (1890-1891; 2nd ed., 1905). For his life see the autobiographical
works Meine Kinderjahre (1894) and Von zwanzig bis
dreissig (1898), also Briefe an seine Familie (1905); also F. Servaes,
Theodor Fontane (1900).




FONTANES, LOUIS, Marquis de (1757-1821), French poet and
politician, was born at Niort (Deux SÃ¨vres) on the 6th of March
1757. He belonged to a noble Protestant family of Languedoc
which had been reduced to poverty by the revocation of the edict
of Nantes. His father and grandfather remained Protestant,
but he was himself brought up as a Catholic. His parents died
in 1774-1775, and in 1777 Fontanes went to Paris, where he
found a friend in the dramatist J.F. Ducis. His first published
poems, some of which were inspired by English models, appeared
in the Almanack des Muses; &ldquo;Le Cri de mon c&oelig;ur,&rdquo; describing
his own sad childhood, in 1778; and &ldquo;La ForÃªt de Navarre&rdquo;
in 1780. His translation from Alexander Pope, L&rsquo;Essai sur
l&rsquo;homme, was published with an elaborate preface in 1783, and
La Chartreuse and Le Jour des morts in the same year,
Le Verger in 1788 and his Ã‰pÃ®tre sur l&rsquo;Ã©dit en faveur des
non-catholiques, and the Essai sur l&rsquo;astronomie in 1789.
Fontanes was a moderate reformer, and in 1790 he became
joint-editor of the ModÃ©rateur. He married at Lyons in 1792,
and his wife&rsquo;s first child was born during their flight from the
siege of that town. Fontanes was in hiding in Paris when the four
citizens of Lyons were sent to the Convention to protest against
the cruelties of Collot d&rsquo;Herbois. The petition was drawn up
by Fontanes, and the authorship being discovered, he fled from
Paris and found shelter at Sevran, near Livry, and afterwards
at Andelys. On the fall of Robespierre he was made professor
of literature in the Ã‰cole Centrale des Quatre-Nations, and he
was one of the original members of the Institute. In the
MÃ©morial, a journal edited by La Harpe, he discreetly advocated
reaction to the monarchical principle. He was exiled by the
Directory and made his way to London, where he was closely
associated with Chateaubriand. He soon returned to France,
and his admiration for Napoleon, who commissioned him to
write an Ã©loge on Washington, secured his return to the Institute
and his political promotion. In 1802 he was elected to the legislative
chamber, of which he was president from 1804 to 1810.
Other honours and titles followed. He has been accused of
servility to Napoleon, but he had the courage to remonstrate
with him on the judicial murder of the due d&rsquo;Enghien, and as
grand master of the university of Paris (1808-1815) he consistently
supported religious and monarchical principles. He
acquiesced in the Bourbon restoration, and was made a marquis
in 1817. He died on the 17th of March 1821 in Paris, leaving
eight cantos of an unfinished epic poem entitled La GrÃ¨ce sauvÃ©e.

The verse of Fontanes is polished and musical in the style of
the 18th century. It was not collected until 1839, when Sainte-Beuve
edited the &OElig;uvres (2 vols.) of Fontanes, with a sympathetic
critical study of the author and his career. But by
that time the Romantic movement was in the ascendant and
Fontanes met with small appreciation.



FONTENAY-LE-COMTE, a town of western France, capital
of an arrondissement in the department of VendÃ©e 30 m. N.E.
of La Rochelle on the State railway between that town and
Saumur. Pop. (1906) town, 7639; commune, 10,326. Fontenay,
an ancient and straggling town, is situated a few miles south of
the forest of Vouvant and on both banks of the VendÃ©e, at the
point where it becomes navigable. The church of Notre-Dame
(15th to 18th centuries), which has a fine spire and a richly
sculptured western entrance, and the church of St Jean (16th
and 17th centuries) are the chief religious buildings. The town
has several houses of the 16th and 17th centuries. The most
remarkable of these is the HÃ´tel de Terre Neuve (1595-1600),
which contains much rich decoration together with collections
of furniture and tapestry. Fontenay was the birthplace of many
prominent men during the 15th and 16th centuries, and the
Fontaine des Quatre-Tias, a fountain in the Renaissance style,
given to the town by King Francis I., commemorates the fact.
The chief square is named after FranÃ§ois ViÃ¨te, the great
mathematician, who was born at Fontenay in 1540. The public
institutions of the town include a tribunal of first instance and
a communal college. Among its industries are the manufacture
of felt hats, oil and soap and timber-sawing, flour-milling and
tanning. There is trade in horses, mules, timber, grain, fruit, &amp;c.

Fontenay was in existence as early as the time of the Gauls.
The affix of &ldquo;comte&rdquo; is said to have been applied to it when it
was taken by King Louis IX. from the family of Lusignan and
given to his brother Alphonse, count of Poitou, under whom
it became capital of Bas-Poitou. Ceded to the English by the
treaty of BrÃ©tigny in 1360 it was retaken in 1372 by Duguesclin.
It suffered repeated capture during the Religious Wars of the
16th century, was dismantled in 1621 and was occupied both
by the republicans and the Vendeans in the war of 1793. From
1790 to 1806 it was capital of the department of VendÃ©e.



FONTENELLE, BERNARD LE BOVIER DE (1657-1757),
French author, was born at Rouen, on the 11th of February
1657. He died in Paris, on the 9th of January 1757, having
thus very nearly attained the age of 100 years. His father was
an advocate settled in Rouen, his mother a sister of the two
Corneille. He was educated at the college of the Jesuits in his
native city, and distinguished himself by the extraordinary
precocity and versatility of his talents. His teachers, who
readily appreciated these, were anxious for him to join their
609
order, but his father had designed him for the bar, and an
advocate accordingly he became; but, having lost the first
cause which was entrusted to him, he soon abandoned law and
gave himself wholly to literary pursuits. His attention was
first directed to poetry; and more than once he competed for
prizes of the French Academy, but never with success. He
visited Paris from time to time and established intimate relations
with the abbÃ© de Saint Pierre, the abbÃ© Vertot and the mathematician
Pierre Varignon. He witnessed, in 1680, the total
failure of his tragedy Aspar. Fontenelle afterwards acknowledged
the justice of the public verdict by burning his unfortunate
drama. His opera of ThÃ©tis et PÃ©lÃ©e, 1689, though highly praised
by Voltaire, cannot be said to rise much above the others; and
it may be regarded as significant that of all his dramatic
works not one has kept the stage. His PoÃ©sies pastorales
(1688) have no greater claim to permanent repute, being characterized
by stiffness and affectation; and the utmost that can
be said for his poetry in general is that it displays much of the
limae labor, great purity of diction and occasional felicity of
expression.

His Lettres galantes du chevalier d&rsquo;Her ..., published
anonymously in 1685, was an amusing collection of stories that
immediately made its mark. In 1686 his famous allegory of
Rome and Geneva, slightly disguised as the rival princesses
Mreo and Eenegu, in the Relation de l&rsquo;Ã®le de BornÃ©o, gave proof
of his daring in religious matters. But it was by his Nouveaux
Dialogues des morts (1683) that Fontenelle established a genuine
claim to high literary rank; and that claim was enhanced three
years later by the appearance of the Entretiens sur la pluralitÃ©
des mondes (1686), a work which was among the very first
to illustrate the possibility of being scientific without being
either uninteresting or unintelligible to the ordinary reader.
His object was to popularize among his countrymen the astronomical
theories of Descartes; and it may well be doubted if
that philosopher ever ranked a more ingenious or successful
expositor among his disciples.

Hitherto Fontenelle had made his home in Rouen, but in 1687
he removed to Paris; and in the same year he published his
Histoire des oracles, a book which made a considerable stir in
theological and philosophical circles. It consisted of two essays,
the first of which was designed to prove that oracles were not
given by the supernatural agency of demons, and the second
that they did not cease with the birth of Christ. It excited the
suspicion of the Church, and a Jesuit, by name Baltus, published
a ponderous refutation of it; but the peace-loving disposition
of its author impelled him to leave his opponent unanswered.
To the following year (1688) belongs his Digression sur les
anciens et les modernes, in which he took the modern side in
the controversy then raging; his Doutes sur le systÃ¨me physique
des causes occasionnelles (against Malebranche) appeared shortly
afterwards.

In 1691 he was received into the French Academy in spite of
the determined efforts of the partisans of the ancients in this
quarrel, especially of Racine and Boileau, who on four previous
occasions had secured his rejection. He consequently was
admitted a member both of the Academy of Inscriptions and of
the Academy of Sciences; and in 1697 he became perpetual
secretary to the latter body. This office he actually held for
the long period of forty-two years; and it was in this official
capacity that he wrote the Histoire du renouvellement de l&rsquo;AcadÃ©mie
des Sciences (Paris, 3 vols., 1708, 1717, 1722) containing extracts
and analyses of the proceedings, and also the Ã©loges of the members,
written with great simplicity and delicacy. Perhaps the best
known of his Ã©loges, of which there are sixty-nine in all, is that
of his uncle Pierre Corneille. This was first printed in the
Nouvelles de la rÃ©publique des lettres (January 1685) and, as
Vie de Corneille, was included in all the editions of Fontenelle&rsquo;s
&OElig;uvres. The other important works of Fontenelle are his
Ã‰lements de la gÃ©ometrie de l&rsquo;infini (1727) and his Apologie des
tourbillons (1752). Fontenelle forms a link between two very
widely different periods of French literature, that of Corneille,
Racine and Boileau on the one hand, and that of Voltaire,
D&rsquo;Alembert and Diderot on the other. It is not in virtue of his
great age alone that this can be said of him; he actually had
much in common with the beaux esprits of the 17th century, as
well as with the philosophes of the 18th. But it is to the latter
rather than to the former period that he properly belongs.

He has no claim to be regarded as a genius; but, as Sainte-Beuve
has said, he well deserves a place &ldquo;dans la classe des
esprits infiniment distinguÃ©s&rdquo;&mdash;distinguished, however, it ought
to be added by intelligence rather than by intellect, and less
by the power of saying much than by the power of saying a little
well. In personal character he has sometimes been described
as having been revoltingly heartless; and it is abundantly
plain that he was singularly incapable of feeling strongly the
more generous emotions&mdash;a misfortune, or a fault, which revealed
itself in many ways. &ldquo;Il faut avoir de l&rsquo;Ã¢me pour avoir du goÃ»t.&rdquo;
But the cynical expressions of such a man are not to be taken
too literally; and the mere fact that he lived and died in the
esteem of many friends suffices to show that the theoretical
selfishness which he sometimes professed cannot have been
consistently and at all times carried into practice.


There have been several collective editions of Fontenelle&rsquo;s works,
the first being printed in 3 vols. at the Hague in 1728-1729. The
best is that of Paris, in 8 vols. 8vo, 1790. Some of his separate
works have been very frequently reprinted and also translated.
The PluralitÃ© des mondes was translated into modern Greek in 1794.
Sainte-Beuve has an interesting essay on Fontenelle, with several
useful references, in the Causeries du lundi, vol. iii. See also Villemain,
Tableau de la littÃ©rature franÃ§aise au XVIIIe siÃ¨cle; the abbÃ©

FONTENOY, a village of Belgium, in the province of Hennegau,
about 4 m. S.E. of Tournai, famous as the scene of the battle of
Fontenoy, in which on the 11th of May 1745 the French army
under Marshal Saxe defeated the Anglo-Allied army under the
duke of Cumberland. The object of the French (see also
Austrian Succession, War of the) was to cover the siege
of the then important fortress of Tournai, that of the Allies,
who slowly advanced from the east, to relieve it. Informed
of the impending attack, Louis XV., with the dauphin, came
with all speed to witness the operations, and by his presence to
give Saxe, who was in bad health and beset with private enemies,
the support necessary to enable him to command effectively.
Under Cumberland served the Austrian field-marshal KÃ¶nigsegg,
and, at the head of the Dutch contingent, the prince of Waldeck.

The right of the French position (see map) rested on the river
at Antoing, which village was fortified and garrisoned, between
Antoing and Fontenoy three square redoubts were constructed,
and Fontenoy itself was put in a complete state of defence. On
the left rear of this line, and separated from Fontenoy by some
furlongs of open ground, another redoubt was made at the corner
of the wood of Barry and a fifth towards Gavrain. The infantry
was arrayed in deployed lines behind the Antoing-Fontenoy
redoubts and the low ridge between Fontenoy and the wood;
behind them was the cavalry. The approaches to Gavrain were
guarded by a mounted volunteer corps called Grassins. At
Calonne the marshal had constructed three military bridges
against the contingency of a forced retreat. The force of the
French was about 60,000 of all arms, not including 22,000 left
in the lines before Tournai. Marshal Saxe himself, who was
suffering from dropsy to such an extent that he was unable to
 mount his horse, slept in a wicker chariot in the midst of the
troops. At early dawn of the 11th of May, the Anglo-Hanoverian
army with the Austrian contingent formed up in front of VÃ©zon,
facing towards Fontenoy and the wood, while the Dutch on their
left extended the general line to PÃ©ronne. The total force was
46,000, against about 52,000 whom Saxe could actually put into
the line of battle.

The plan of attack arranged by Cumberland, KÃ¶nigsegg and
Waldeck on the 10th grew out of circumstances. A preliminary
skirmish had cleared the broken ground immediately about
VÃ©zon and revealed a part of the defender&rsquo;s dispositions. It was
resolved that the Dutch should attack the front Antoing-Fontenoy,
610
while Cumberland should deliver a flank attack
against Fontenoy and all in rear of it, by way of the open ground
between Fontenoy and the wood. A great cavalry attack round
the wood was projected but had to be given up, as in the late
evening of the 10th the Allies&rsquo; light cavalry drew fire from its
southern edge. Cumberland then ordered his cavalry commander
to form a screen facing Fontenoy, so as to cover the formation of
the infantry. On the morning of the 11th another and most
important modification had to be made. The advance was
beginning when the redoubt at the corner of the wood became
visible. Cumberland hastily told off Brigadier James Ingoldsby
(major and brevet-colonel 1st Guards), with four regiments and
an artillery detachment, to storm this redoubt which, crossing
its fire with that of Fontenoy, seemed absolutely to inhibit the
development of the flank attack. At 6 A.M. the brigade moved
off, but it was irresolutely handled and halted time after time;
and after waiting as long as possible, the British and Hanoverian
cavalry under Sir James Campbell rode forward and extended
in the plain, becoming at once the target for a furious cannonade
which killed their leader and drove them back. Thereupon Sir
John (Lord) Ligonier, whose deployment the squadrons were
to have covered, let them pass to the rear, and, hearing the guns
of the Dutch towards Antoing, pushed the British infantry forward
through the lanes, each unit on reaching open ground
covering the exit and deployment of the one in rear, all under the
French cannonade. This went on for two hours, and save that
it showed the magnificent discipline of the British and Hanoverian
regiments, was a bad prelude to the real attack. Cumberland&rsquo;s
own exertions brought a few small guns to the front of the
Guards&rsquo; Brigade, and one of the first shots from these killed
Antoine Louis, duc de Gramont, colonel of the Gardes FranÃ§aises,
and another Henri du Baraillon du Brocard, Saxe&rsquo;s artillery
commander.



It was now 9 A.M., and while the guns from the wood redoubt
battered the upright ranks of the Allies, Ingoldsby&rsquo;s brigade was
huddled together, motionless, on the right. Cumberland himself
galloped thither, and under his reproaches Ingoldsby lost the
last remnants of self-possession. To Sir John Ligonier&rsquo;s aide-de-camp,
who delivered soon afterwards a bitterly formal order
to advance, Ingoldsby sullenly replied that the duke&rsquo;s orders
were for him to advance in line with Ligonier&rsquo;s main body.
By now, too, the Dutch advance against Antoing-Fontenoy had
collapsed.

But on the right the cannonade and the blunders together
had roused a stern and almost blind anger in the leaders and the
men they led. Ingoldsby was wounded, and his successor, the
Hanoverian general Zastrow, gave up the right attack and
brought his battalions into the main body. A second halfhearted
attack on Fontenoy itself, delivered by some Dutch
troops, was almost made successful by the valour of two of these
battalions (one of them being the then newly raised Highland
regiment, the Black Watch) which came thither of their own
accord. Meantime the young duke and the old Austrian field-marshal
had agreed to take all risks and to storm through
between Fontenoy and the wood redoubt, and had launched the
great attack, one of the most celebrated in the history of war.
The English infantry was in two lines. The Hanoverians on
their left, owing to want of space, were compelled to file into third
line behind the redcoats, and on their outer flanks were the
battalions that had been with Ingoldsby. A few guns, man-drawn,
accompanied the assaulting mass, and the cavalry
followed. The column may have numbered 14,000 infantry.
All the infantry battalions closed on their centre, the normal
three ranks becoming six. If the proper distances between lines
were preserved, the mass must have formed an oblong about
500 yds Ã— 600 yds (excluding the cavalry).

The duke of Cumberland placed himself at the head of the
front line and gave the signal to advance. Slowly and in parade
order, drums beating and colours flying, the mass advanced,
straight up the gentle slope, which was swept everywhere by
the flanking artillery of the defence. Then, when the first line
reached the low crest on the ends of which stood the French
artillery, the fire, hitherto convergent, became a full enfilade
from both sides, and at the same moment the enemy&rsquo;s horse and
foot became visible beyond. A brief pause ensued, and the
front gradually contracted as regiments shouldered inwards to
avoid the fire. Then the French advanced, and the Guards
Brigade and the Gardes FranÃ§aises met face to face. Captain
Lord Charles Hay (d. 1760), lieutenant of the First (Grenadier)
Guards, suddenly ran in front of the line, took off his hat to the
enemy and drank to them from a pocket flask, shouting a taunt,
&ldquo;We hope you will stand till we come up to you, and not swim
the river as you did at Dettingen,&rdquo; then, turning to his own men,
he called for three cheers. The astonished French officers
returned the salute and gave a ragged counter-cheer. Whether
or not the French, as legend states, were asked and refused to
fire first, the whole British line fired one tremendous series of
volleys by companies. 50 officers and 760 men of the three
foremost French regiments fell at once, and at so appalling a
loss the remnant broke and fled. Three hundred paces farther
on stood the second line of the French, and slowly the mass
advanced, firing regular volleys. It was now well inside the
French position, and no longer felt the enfilade fire that swept
the crest it had passed over. By now, as the rear lines closed up,
the assailants were practically in square and repelled various
partial attacks coming from all sides. The RÃ©giment du Roi
lost 33 officers and 345 men at the hands of the Second (Coldstream)
Guards. But these counter-attacks gained a few
precious minutes for the French. It was the crisis of the battle.
The king, though the court meditated flight, stood steady with
the dauphin at his side,&mdash;Fontenoy was the one great day of
Louis XV.&rsquo;s life,&mdash;and Saxe, ill as he was, mounted his horse to
collect his cavalry for a charge. The British and Hanoverians
were now at a standstill. More and heavier counter-strokes
were repulsed, but no progress was made; their cavalry was unable
to get to the front, and Saxe was by now thinking of victory.
Captain Isnard of the Touraine regiment suggested artillery to
batter the face of the square, preparatory to a final charge.
General LÃ¶wendahl galloped up to Saxe, crying, &ldquo;This is a great
day for the king; they will never escape!&rdquo; The nearest guns
were planted in front of the assailants, and used with effect.
The infantry, led by LÃ¶wendahl, fastened itself on the sides of
the square, the regiments of Normandy and Vaisseaux and the
611
Irish Brigade conspicuous above the rest. On the front, waiting
for the cannon to do its work, were the Maison du Roi, the Gendarmerie
and all the light cavalry, under Saxe himself, the duke of
Richelieu and count d&rsquo;EstrÃ©es. The left wing of the Allies was
still inactive, and troops were brought up from Antoing and
Fontenoy to support the final blow. About 2 P.M. it was delivered,
and in eight minutes the square was broken. As the
infantry retired across the plain in small stubborn groups the
French fire still made havoc in their ranks, but all attempts
to close with them were repulsed by the terrible volleys, and
they regained the broken ground about VÃ©zon, whence they had
come. Cumberland himself and all the senior generals remained
with the rearguard.

The losses at Fontenoy were, as might be expected, somewhat
less than normally heavy when distributed over the whole of
both armies, but exceedingly severe in the units really engaged.
Eight out of nineteen regiments of British infantry lost over
200 men, two of these more than 300. A tribute to the loyalty
and discipline of the British, as compared with the generality
of armies in those days, may be found in the fact that the three
Guards&rsquo; regiments had no &ldquo;missing&rdquo; men whatever. The 23rd
(Royal Welsh Fusiliers) had 322 casualties. BÃ¶schlanger&rsquo;s
Hanoverian regiment suffered even more heavily, and four
others of that nation had 200 or more casualties. The total
loss was about 7500, that of the French 7200. The French
&ldquo;Royal&rdquo; regiment lost 30 officers and 645 men; some other
regimental casualties have been mentioned above. The Dutch
lost a bare 7% of their strength.

Fontenoy was in the 18th century what the attack of the
Prussian Guards at St Privat is to-day, a locus classicus for military
theorists. But the technical features of the battle are completely
overshadowed by its epic interest, and above all it illustrates
the permanent and unchangeable military characteristics of the
British and French nations.



FONTEVRAULT, or Fontevraud (Lat. Fons Ebraldi), a
town of western France, in the department of Maine-et-Loire,
10 m. S.E. of Saumur by road and 2Â½ m. from the confluence of
the Loire and Vienne. Pop. (1906) 1279. It is situated in the
midst of the forest of Fontevrault. The interest of the place
centres in its abbey, which since 1804 has been utilized and abused
as a central house of detention for convicts. The church (12th
century), of which only the choir and apse are appropriated to
divine service, has a beautiful nave formerly covered by four
cupolas destroyed in 1816. There is a fifth cupola above the
crossing. In a chapel in the south transept are the effigies of
Henry II. of England, of his wife Eleanor of Guienne, of Richard
I. of England and of Isabella of AngoulÃªme, wife of John of
England&mdash;Eleanor&rsquo;s being of oak and the rest of stone. The
cloister, refectory and chapter-house date from the 16th century.
The second court of the abbey contains a remarkable building,
the Tour d&rsquo;Ã‰vrault (12th century), which long went under the
misnomer of chapelle funÃ©raire, but was in reality the old kitchen.
Details and diagrams will be found in Viollet-le-Duc&rsquo;s Dictionnaire
de l&rsquo;architecture. There are three stories, the whole being
surmounted by a pyramidal structure.

The Order of Fontevrault was founded about 1100 by Robert
of Arbrissel, who was born in the village of Arbrissel or Arbresec,
in the diocese of Rennes, and attained great fame as a preacher
and ascetic. The establishment was a double monastery,
containing a nunnery of 300 nuns and a monastery of 200 monks,
separated completely so that no communication was allowed
except in the church, where the services were carried on in
common; there were, moreover, a hospital for 120 lepers and
other sick, and a penitentiary for fallen women, both worked by
the nuns. The basis of the life was the Benedictine rule, but the
observance of abstinence and silence went beyond it in stringency.
The special feature of the institute was that the abbess ruled
the monks as well as the nuns. At the beginning the order had
a great vogue, and at the time of Robert&rsquo;s death, 1117, there
were several monasteries and 3000 nuns; afterwards the number
of monasteries reached 57, all organized on the same plan. The
institute never throve out of France; there were attempts to
introduce it into Spain and England: in England there were
three houses&mdash;at Ambresbury (Amesbury in Wiltshire), Nuneaton,
and Westwood in Worcestershire. The nuns in England as in
France were recruited from the highest families, and the abbess
of Fontevrault, who was the superior-general of the whole order,
was usually of the royal family of France.

FOOD (like the verb &ldquo;to feed,&rdquo; from a Teutonic root, whence
O. Eng. foda; cf. &ldquo;fodder&rdquo;; connected with Gr. &#960;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;,
to feed), the general term for what is eaten by man and other
creatures for the sustenance of life. The scientific aspect of
human food is dealt with under Nutrition and Dietetics.

Infancy.&mdash;The influence of a normal diet upon the health of
man (we exclude here the question of diet in illness, which must
depend on the abnormal conditions existing) begins at the
earliest stage of his life. No food has as yet been found so suitable
for the young of all animals as their mother&rsquo;s milk. This, however,
has not been from want of seeking. Dr Brouzet (Sur l&rsquo;Ã©ducation
mÃ©dicinale des enfants, i. p. 165) had such a bad opinion of human
mothers, that he expressed a wish for the state to interfere and
prevent them from suckling their children, lest they should
communicate immorality and disease! A still more determined
pessimist was the famous chemist Van Helmont, who thought
life had been reduced to its present shortness by our inborn
propensities, and proposed to substitute bread boiled in beer
and honey for milk, which latter he calls &ldquo;brute&rsquo;s food.&rdquo; Baron
Justus von Liebig, as the result of his chemical researches,
introduced a &ldquo;food for infants,&rdquo; which in more modern days
has been followed by a multiplication of patent foods. A close
imitation of human milk may also be made by the addition to
fresh cow&rsquo;s milk of half its bulk of soft water, in each pint of
which has been mixed a heaped-up teaspoonful of powdered
&ldquo;sugar of milk&rdquo; and a pinch of phosphate of lime. These
artificial substitutes for the natural nutriment have their value
where for any reason it is not available. The wholesomest food,
however, for the first six months is certainly mother&rsquo;s milk alone.
A vigorous baby can indeed bear with impunity much rough
usage, and often appears none the worse for a certain quantity
of farinaceous food; but the majority do not get habituated to
it without an exhibition of dislike which indicates rebellion of
the bowels. It is only when the teeth are on their way to the
front, as shown by dribbling, that the parotid glands secrete
an active saliva capable of digesting bread stuffs. Till then
anything but milk must be given tentatively, and considered
in the light of a means of education for its future mode of nutrition.

The time for weaning should be fixed partly by the child&rsquo;s
age, partly by the growth of the teeth. The first group of teeth
nine times out of ten consists of the lower central front teeth,
which may appear any time during the sixth and seventh month.
The mother may then begin to diminish the number of suckling
times; and by a month she can have reduced them to twice
a day, so as to be ready when the second group makes its way
through the upper front gums to cut off the supply altogether.
The third group, the lateral incisors and first grinders, usually
after the first anniversary of birth, give notice that solid food
can be chewed. But it is prudent to let dairy milk form a considerable
portion of the fare till the eye-teeth are cut, which
seldom happens till the eighteenth or twentieth month.

Childhood and Youth.&mdash;At this stage of life the diet must
obviously be the best which is a transition from that of infancy
to that of adult age. Growth is not completed, but yet entire
surrender of every consideration to the claim of growth is not
possible, nor indeed desirable. Moreover, that abundance of
adipose tissue, or reserve new growth, which a baby can bear
is an impediment to the due education of the muscles of the boy
or girl. The supply of nutriment need not be so continuous as
before, but at the same time should be more frequent than for
612
the adult. Up to at least fourteen or fifteen years of age the rule
should be four meals a day, varied indeed, but nearly equal in
nutritive power and in quantity, that is to say, all moderate,
all sufficient. The maturity the body then reaches involves a
hardening and enlargement of the bones and cartilages, and a
strengthening of the digestive organs, which in healthy young
persons enables us to dispense with some of the watchful care
bestowed upon their diet. Three full meals a day are generally
sufficient, and the requirements of mental training may be
allowed to a certain extent to modify the attention to nutrition
which has hitherto been paramount.

Adults.&mdash;It is only necessary here to refer to the article on
Dietetics (see also Vegetarianism) for a discussion of the food
of normal adults; and to such headings as Dietary (for fixed
allowances) or Cookery. Different staple articles of food are
dealt with under their own headings. For animals other than
man see the respective articles on them.


Among numerous books on the subject, in addition to those
enumerated under Dietetics, see Sir Henry Thompson&rsquo;s Foods and
Feeding (1894); Hart&rsquo;s Diet in Sickness and Health (1896); Knight,
Food and its Functions (1895).




FOOD PRESERVATION. The preservation of food material
beyond the short term during which it naturally keeps sound and
eatable has engaged human thought from the earliest dawn of
civilization. Necessity compelled man to store the plenitude
of one season or place against the need of another. The hunter
dried, smoked and salted meat and fish, pastoral man preserved
milk in the form of cheese and butter, or fermented grape-juice
into wine. With the separation of country from town, the
development of manufacturing nation as distinct from agricultural
and food-producing people, the spreading of civilized man
from torrid to arctic zones, the needs of travellers on land and
sea and of armies on the march, the problem of the prevention
of the natural decomposition to which nearly all food substances
are liable became increasingly urgent, and forms to-day, next
to the production of food, the most important problem in connexion
with the feeding and the trade of nations. As long as the
reasons of decomposition were unknown, all attempts at preservation
were necessarily empirical, and of the numberless
processes which have during modern times been proposed and
attempted comparatively few have stood the test of experience.
In the light of modern knowledge, however, the guiding principles
appear to be very simple.

Very few organic materials undergo decomposition, as it
were, of their own accord. They may lose water by evaporation,
and fatty substances may alter by the absorption of oxygen
from the air. They are otherwise quite stable and unchangeable
while not attacked and eaten up by living organisms, or while
the life with which they may be endowed is in a state of suspense.
An apple is alive and in breathing undergoes its ripening change;
a grain of wheat is dormant and does not alter. A substance,
in order to be a food material, must be decomposable under the
attack of a living organism; the energy stored in it must be
available to that stream of energy which we call life, whether the
life be in the form of the human consumer or of any lower
organism. All decomposition of food is due to the development
within the food of living organisms. Under conditions under
which living organisms cannot enter or cannot develop food
keeps undecomposed for an indefinite length of time. The
problem of food preservation resolves itself, therefore, into that
of keeping out or killing off all living things that might feed
upon and thus alter the food, and as these organisms mainly
belong to the family of moulds, yeasts and bacteria, modern food
preservation is strictly a subject for the bacteriologist.

The changes which food undergoes on keeping are easily
intelligible when once their biological origin is recognized.
Yeasts cause the decomposition of saccharine substances into
alcohol and carbon dioxide, acetic and lactic ferments produce
from sugar or from alcohol the organic acids causing the souring
of food, moulds as a rule cause oxidation and complete destruction
of organic matter, nitrogenous or saccharine, while most
bacteria act mainly upon the nitrogenous constituents, producing
albumoses and peptones and breaking up the complex albumen-molecule
into numerous smaller molecules often allied to alkaloids,
generally with the production of evil-smelling gases.
These processes may go on simultaneously, but more frequently
take place successively in the decomposition of food, one set of
organisms taking up the work of destruction as the conditions
become favourable to its development and unfavourable to its
predecessor. The organisms may come from the air, the soil
or from animal sources. The air teems with organisms which
settle and may develop when brought upon a favourable nidus;
the organic matter of the soil largely consists of fungoid life;
while the intestinal canal and other mucous membranes of all
animals harbour bacteria, sarcinae and other organisms in
countless millions. Whenever, therefore, food material is exposed
to the air, or touched by the soil or by animals or man,
it becomes infected with living cells, which by their development
lead to its decomposition and destruction.

Fungoid organisms may be killed by heat or by chemicals;
or their development may be arrested by cold, removal of water,
or by the presence of agents inhibiting their growth though not
destroying their life. All successful processes of food preservation
depend upon one or other of these circumstances.

Preservation by Heat.&mdash;At the boiling-point of water all living
cells perish, but some spores of bacteria may survive for about
three hours. Few adult bacteria can live beyond 75Â° C. (167Â° F.)
in the presence of water, though dry heat only kills with certainty
at 140Â° C. (284Â° F.). Destruction of life takes place more rapidly
in solutions showing an acid than a feebly alkaline reaction;
hence acid fruit is more easily preserved than milk, which,
when quite fresh, is alkaline. By cooking, therefore, food
becomes temporarily sterile, until a fresh crop of organisms finds
access from the air. By repeated cooking all food can be indefinitely
preserved. One of the most important functions of
cookery is sterilization. Civilized man unwittingly revolts
against the consumption of non-sterile food, and the use of
certain fungus-infected material is an inheritance from barbarous
ages; few materials of animal origin are eaten raw, and in
vegetables some sort of sterilizing process is attempted by
washing (of salads) or removal of the outer skin (of fruits).
All preparation of food for the table, cooking being the most
important, tends towards preservation, but is effectual only for
a few hours or days at most, unless special means are adopted
to prevent reinfection. The housewife covering the jam with
a thin paper soaked in brandy, or the potted meat with a thin
layer of lard, attempts unconsciously to bar the road to bacteria
and other minute organisms. To preserve food in a permanent
manner and on a commercial scale it has to be cooked in a
receptacle which must be sufficiently strong for transport,
cheap, light and unattacked by the material in contact with it.
None of the receptacles at present in use quite fulfils the whole
of these conditions: glass and china are heavy and fragile, and
their carriage is expensive; tinned iron, so-called tin-plate,
is rarely quite unaffected by food materials, but owing to its
strength, tenacity and cheapness, it is used on an ever-increasing
scale. The sheet iron, which formerly was made of soft wrought
iron, now generally consists of steel containing but very little
carbon; it is cleaned by immersion in acid and covered with a
very thin layer of pure tin, all excess of tin being removed by
hot rollers and brushes. The layer of tin, which formerly constituted
from 3 to 5% of the total weight of the plate, has,
owing to the increased price of tin and the improvement in
machinery, gradually become so thin that its weight is only from
1 to 3%. Not rarely, therefore, the tin-surface is imperfect,
perforated or pin-holed. Tin itself is slightly attacked by all acid
juices of vegetable or animal substances. With the exception
of milk, all human food is slightly acid, and consequently all
food that has been preserved in tin canisters contains variable
traces of dissolved tin. Happily, salts of tin have but little
physiological action. Nevertheless, the employment cf tin-plate
for very acid materials, like tomatoes, peaches, &amp;c., is very
objectionable.

The process of preservation in canisters is carried out as
613
follows:&mdash;The canister, which has been made either by the use
of solder or by folding machinery only, is packed with the material
to be preserved, and a little water having been added to fill the
interstices the lid is secured by soldering or folding, generally
the former. Sterilization is effected by placing the  tins in
pressure chambers, which are heated by steam to 120Â° C. or more.
The  tins are exposed to that temperature for such time as
experience has shown to be necessary to heat the contents
throughout to at least 100Â° C. The temperature is then allowed
to fall slowly to below the boiling-point of water, when the
tins can be taken out of the pressure chamber, or they are placed
in pans filled with water or a solution of calcium chloride and
are therein heated till thoroughly cooked. Sometimes a small
aperture is pierced through the lid, to allow of the escape of the
expanding air, such holes before cooling closed by means
of a drop of solder. This process, which was originally introduced
by FranÃ§ois Appert early in the 19th century, is employed
on an enormous scale, especially in America. The use of
lacquered  tins, having the inner surface of the tin covered with
a heat-resisting varnish, is gradually extending. Imperfect
sterilization shows itself in many cases by gas development
within the tin, which causes the ends to become convex and
drummy. More frequently than not the contents of the larger
tins, containing meat or other animal products, are not absolutely
sterile, but the conditions are mostly such that the organisms
which have survived the cooking process cannot develop. When
they can develop without formation of gas dangerous products
of decomposition may be produced without showing themselves
to taste or smell. Numerous cases of so-called ptomaine poisoning
have thus occurred; these are more frequently associated
with preserved fish and lobster than with meats, although no
class of preserved animal food is free from liability of ptomaine
formation. The formation of poisonous substances has never
been traced to preserved fruit or other material poor in nitrogen.
The mode of preserving food in china or glass is quite similar,
but the losses by breakage are not inconsiderable. Food which
has been preserved in  tins is sometimes transferred to glass and
re-sterilized, the feeling against &ldquo;tinned&rdquo; food caused by the
&ldquo;Chicago scandals&rdquo; not having entirely subsided. Were it not
for the facts that sterilization is rarely quite perfect, and that the
food attacks the tin, the contents of tin canisters ought to keep
for an indefinite length of time. Under existing circumstances,
however, there is a distinct limit to the age of soundness of
canned food.

Preservation by Chemicals.&mdash;Salt is the oldest chemical preservative
and, either alone or in conjunction with saltpetre and
with wood-smoke, has been used for many centuries, mainly as
a meat preservative. It is used either dry in layers strewn on
the surface of the meat or fish to be preserved, or in the form of
brine in which the meat is submerged or which is injected into
the carcasses. The preserving power of salt is but moderate.
It has the great advantage that in ordinary doses it is non-injurious,
that an excess at once betrays itself in the taste, and
that it can be readily removed by soaking in water. When
aided by wood-smoke, which depends for its preservative power
upon traces of creosote and formaldehyde, it is, however, quite
efficient. The addition of saltpetre is principally for the purpose
of giving to the meat a bright pink tint. The strongly saline
taste of pickled meat or salted butter appears gradually to have
become repugnant to a large part of mankind, and other preservatives
have come into use, possessing greater bactericidal
power and less taste. The serious objection attaching to them
is discussed in the article Adulteration. At the present time
the use of borax or boracic acid is almost universal in England.
Meat which has been exposed to the vapours of formaldehyde,
and has thus been superficially sterilized, is also coming into
commerce in increasing quantities. Formaldehyde in itself is
distinctly poisonous, and has the property of combining with
albuminoids and rendering them completely insoluble in the
digestive secretions. Salicylic and benzoic acids are not infrequently
used to stop fermentation of saccharine beverages
or deterioration of so-called &ldquo;potted meats,&rdquo; which are supposed
to last fresh and sweet on the consumer&rsquo;s table for a considerable
length of time. Sulphurous acid and sulphites are chiefly used
in the preservation of thin ales, wine and fruit, and sodium
fluoride has been found in butter. The whole of these substances
possess decided and injurious physiological properties. Alcohol
now rarely forms a preservative of food material, its employment
being confined to small fruit. The use of sugar as a preservative
depends upon the fact that, although in a dilute solution it
is highly prone to fermentation and other decomposition, it
possesses bactericidal properties when in the form of a concentrated
syrup. A sugar solution containing 30% of water or less
does not undergo any biological change; in the presence of
organic acids, like those contained in fruit, growth of organisms
is inhibited when the percentage of water is somewhat greater.
Upon this fact depends the use of sugar in the manufacture of
jams, marmalades and jellies. Moulds may grow on the surface
of such saccharine preparations, but the interior remains unaffected
and unaltered.

Preservation by Drying.&mdash;Food materials in which the percentage
of moisture is small (not exceeding about 8%) are but little
liable to bacterial growths, at most to the attacks of innocent
Penicillium. Nature preserves the germs in seeds and nuts,
which are laden with otherwise decomposable food material,
by the simple expedient of water removal. The life of cereal
grains and many seeds appears to be unlimited. By the removal
of water the most perishable materials, like meat or eggs, can be
rendered unchangeable, except so far as the inevitable oxidation
of the fatty substances contained in them is concerned and
which is independent of life-action. The drying of meat, upon
which a generation ago inventors bestowed a great deal of
attention, has become almost obsolete, excepting for comparatively
small articles or animals, like ox tongues or tails and fish.
It has been superseded even among less civilized communities
by the spread of canned food. Fruit, however, is very largely
preserved in the dried state. Grapes are sun-dried and thus form
currants, raisins and sultanas, the last variety being often
bleached by the addition of sulphites. Plums, apples and pears
are artificially dried in ovens on wooden battens or on wire
sieves; from the latter they are apt to become contaminated
with notable quantities of zinc. Excellent preparations of dried
vegetables, including potatoes, carrots, onions, French beans
and cabbages, are also manufactured.

The utilization of meat in the form of meat extract belongs to
some extent to this class of preserved foods. Its origin is due
to J. von Liebig and Max von Pettenkofer, and dates from the
middle of the 19th century. The soluble material is extracted
mainly from beef, in Australia to some extent from mutton,
by means of warm water; the albumen is coagulated by heat
and removed, and the broths thus obtained are evaporated in
vacuo until the extract contains no more than about 20% of
water. One pound of extract is obtained from about 25 &#8468; of lean
beef.

Preservation by Refrigeration.&mdash;At or below the freezing-point
of water fungoid organisms are incapable of growth and multiplication.
Although it has been asserted that many of them perish
when kept for some time in the frozen condition, it is certain that
the vast majority of bacteria and their germs remain merely
dormant. Even so highly organized structures as cereal seeds
do not suffer in vitality on being kept for a considerable length
of time at the far lower temperature of liquid air. Biological
change is, therefore, arrested at freezing-point, and as long as
that temperature is maintained food material remains unaltered,
except for physical changes depending upon the evaporation
of water and of volatile flavouring matters, or chemical alterations
due to oxidation.

Refrigeration, therefore, affords the means of keeping for a
reasonably long time, and without the addition of any preservative
substance, food in a raw condition. It is the only
process of preservation which from a sanitary point of view is
entirely unobjectionable as ordinarily and properly employed.
Its introduction on a commercial scale has more powerfully
affected the economic conditions of England and, to a less degree,
614
of the United States than any other scientific advance since the
establishment of railways and steamboats. Enormous quantities
of frozen carcasses, butter, fruit, vegetables and fish are introduced
in the fresh condition into Great Britain and stored until
required. Extreme fluctuations of supply or of price have
become almost impossible, and the abundance of Australian and
New Zealand ranches, and of West Indian orchards, has been
made readily accessible to the British consumer. For household
purposes cooling in ice-chests or ice-chambers suffices to preserve
food on a comparatively small scale. The ice used for the
purpose comes, to a small extent, from natural sources, stored
from the winter or imported from northern countries; a far
larger quantity is artificially produced by the methods described
in the article on Refrigerating, which also contains an account
of the means by which low temperatures are produced for
industrial purposes of importation and storage. Fleets of
steamships fitted with refrigerating machinery and insulated
cold-rooms are employed in carrying the food materials, which
are deposited in cold-stores at docks, warehouses, markets and
hotels. The first cargo of frozen meat was shipped in July 1873
from Melbourne, but arrived in October in an unsatisfactory
state. In 1875-1876 sound frozen meat came from America.
The first cargo of frozen meat was successfully brought to the
United Kingdom in 1880 from Australia in the &ldquo;Strathleven,&rdquo;
fitted with a Bell-Coleman air machine. The temperature in the
cold-storage rooms is generally kept near 34Â° F., whilst in the
chilling chambers a somewhat lower, and in the freezing room or
chambers a much lower temperature (between 0Â° and 10Â° F.)
is maintained. The carcasses to be frozen should be cooled
slowly at first to ensure even freezing throughout and to prevent
damage by the unequal expansion of the outer layer of ice.
The carcasses when freezing must be hung separated from each
other, but for storage or transportation they are packed tightly
together. Fish such as salmon is washed, thoroughly cleansed,
and frozen on trays. Butter should be cooled as rapidly as
possible to about 10Â° F.; its composition as regards proportion
of volatile fatty-acids, &amp;c., remains absolutely unaltered for
years. Cheese should only be cold-stored when nearly ripe and
should not be frozen. Eggs must be carefully selected, each
one being inspected by candle-light. They are placed in cases
holding about three hundred, which are taken first to a room
in which they are slowly cooled to about 33Â° F., and are then kept
in store just below freezing-point. Particular attention must be
paid to the relative humidity of the air in egg stores. Fruit
should be quite fresh; grapes may be chilled to 26Â° F., while
lemons cannot safely be kept at a lower temperature than 36Â°.
The time during which soft fruit can be kept even in cold-store
is limited, and does not exceed about six weeks.

In the early days of the chilled-meat trade considerable
prejudice existed against stored meat. While in many cases the
flavour of fresh meat is rather superior, the food value is in no
way altered by cold-storage.1

Preservation by Pickling other than Salt.&mdash;For the preservation
of vegetables, vinegar or other solution of acetic acid is used to
a limited extent. Eggs are submerged in lime-water or a dilute
solution of sodium silicate (soluble glass). During the storage
of eggs the more aqueous white of egg yields by endosmosis a
portion of its water to the more concentrated yolk, which thereby
expands and renders its thin containing-membrane liable to
rupture. Fish, such as sardines, sprats and salmon, is preserved
by packing in olive or other oil.

The preservation of the most important dairy product, namely,
milk, deserves a separate notice. It has already been stated that
alkaline liquids, like milk, are more difficult to sterilize by heat
than acid materials. In consequence of the alteration in flavour
which milk undergoes by long continued boiling, and of the fact
that milk forms perhaps the best medium for the growth and
propagation of bacterial organisms, there is exceptional difficulty
in its sterilization. As secreted by a healthy cow it is a perfectly
sterile fluid, and, as shown by Sir J. Lister, when drawn under
aseptic conditions and kept under such, it remains definitely
fresh and sweet. Bacterial and other pollution at the time of
milking arises from the animal, the stable, the milker and the
vessels. In animals suffering from tuberculosis and other
bacterial affections the milk may be infected within the udder.
Milk as it reaches the consumer rarely contains less than 50,000
bacteria and often many millions per cubic centimetre. In fresh
country cream 100 millions per cubic centimetre are not unusual.
These bacteria are of many kinds, some of them spore-bearing.
The spores are more difficult to kill than the adult organism.
The first step towards preservation is the removal of the dirt
unavoidably present, to the particles of which a considerable
proportion of the bacteria adhere. Filtration through cloths or,
better, the passing of the milk through centrifugals effects that
removal. Subsequent treatment is preferably preceded by a
breaking-up of the larger fat-globules by the projection of a jet
of the milk under high pressures against a steel or agate plate,
a process known as homogenizing. From homogenized milk the
cream separates slowly, and does not form the coherent layer
thrown up by ordinary milk. Heating is then effected either after
bottling or by passing the milk continuously through pipes in
which it is heated to from 160Â° to 170Â° F. By a repetition of
the heating process on two or more succeeding days, complete
sterilization may be effected, although a single treatment is
sufficient to render the milk stable for a few days. Many forms
of pasteurizing apparatus for milk are in use. Since the general
introduction of pasteurization of the skim-milk used in Denmark
for the feeding of calves and pigs, tuberculosis in these animals
has practically disappeared. On the continent of Europe the use
of sterilized milk is now very general. In England it has found
little favour in households, but is making rapid progress on board
ship.

Milk which has been condensed has for many years found a
most extensive sale. The first efforts to condense and thus
preserve milk date from 1835, when an English patent was
granted to Newton. In 1849 C.N. Horsford prepared condensed
milk with the addition of lactose. Commercially successful milk
condensation began in 1856. The milk is heated to about
180Â° F. and filled into large copper vacuum pans, after having
been mixed with from 10 to 12 parts of sugar per 100 parts of
milk. Evaporation takes place in the pans at about 122Â° F.,
and is carried on till the milk is boiled down to such concentration
that 100 parts of the condensed milk, including the sugar,
contain the solids of 300 parts of milk. Sweetened condensed
milk, although rarely quite sterile, keeps indefinitely, and is
invariably brought into commerce in tin canisters. The preparation
of sweetened condensed milk forms one of the most important
branches of manufacture in Switzerland and is steadily increasing
in England. Although milk can quite well be preserved in the
form of condensed unsweetened milk, which dietetically possesses
immense advantages over the sweetened milk in which the
balance between carbohydrates and albuminoids is very unfavourable,
such unsweetened milk has found little or no favour.
Milk powder is manufactured under various patents, the most
successful of which depends upon the addition of sodium bicarbonate
and the subsequent rapid evaporation of the milk on
steam-heated revolving iron cylinders. Milk powder made from
skim-milk keeps well for considerable periods, but full-cream
milk develops rancid or tallowy flavours by the oxidation of the
finely divided butter-fat. It is largely employed in the preparation
of so-called milk chocolates.

for 1907 (1908) of the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, pp. 197-206,
with illustrations of chickens kept in cold storage for two and three
years. The results there shown cast considerable doubt on the
efficiency of even refrigeration so far as an &ldquo;indefinite&rdquo; period is
concerned; and it is suggested that the consumption of frozen meat
may really account for various modern diseases.




FOOL (O. Fr. fol, modern fou, foolish, from a Late Latin use of
follis, bellows, a ball filled with air, for a stupid person, a jester,
a wind-bag), a buffoon or jester.

The class of professional fools or jesters, which reached its
culminating point of influence and recognized place and function
in the social organism during the middle ages, appears to have
existed in all times and countries. Not only have there always
615
been individuals naturally inclined and endowed to amuse others;
there has been besides in most communities a definite class, the
members of which have used their powers or weaknesses in this
direction as a regular means of getting a livelihood. Savage
jugglers, medicine-men, and even priests, have certainly much in
common with the jester by profession. There existed in ancient
Greece a distinct class of professed fools whose habits were not
essentially different from those of the jesters of the middle ages.
Of the behaviour of one of these, named Philip, Xenophon has
given a picturesque account in the Banquet. Philip of Macedon
is said to have possessed a court fool, and certainly these (as
well as court poets and court philosophers, with whom they have
sometimes been not unreasonably confounded) were common
in a number of the petty courts at that era of civilization. Scurrae
and moriones were the Roman parallels of the medieval witty
fool; and during the empire the manufacture of human monstrosities
was a regular practice, slaves of this kind being much
in request to relieve the languid hours. The jester again has
from time immemorial existed at eastern courts. Witty stories
are told of Bahalul (see D&rsquo;Herbelot, s.v.) the jester of Harun al-Reshid,
which have long had a place in Western fiction. On the
conquest of Mexico court fools and deformed human creatures
of all kinds were found at the court of Montezuma. But that
monarch no doubt hit upon one great cause of the favour of
monarchs for this class when he said that &ldquo;more instruction
was to be gathered from them than from wiser men, for they
dared to tell the truth.&rdquo; Douce, in his essay On the Clowns and
Fools of Shakespeare, has made a ninefold division of English
fools, according to quality and place of employment, as the
domestic fool, the city or corporation fool, the tavern fool, the fool
of the mysteries and moralities. The last is generally called the
&ldquo;vice,&rdquo; and is the original of the stage clowns so common among
the dramatists of the time of Elizabeth, and who embody so
much of the wit of Shakespeare. A very palpable classification
is that which distinguishes between such creatures as were chosen
to excite to laughter from some deformity of mind or body, and
such as were so chosen for a certain (to all appearance generally
very shallow) alertness of mind and power of repartee,&mdash;or briefly,
butts and wits. The dress of the regular court fool of the middle
ages was not altogether a rigid uniform. To judge from the prints
and illuminations which are the sources of our knowledge on this
matter, it seems to have changed considerably from time to time.
The head was shaved, the coat was motley, and the breeches tight,
with generally one leg different in colour from the other. The
head was covered with a garment resembling a monk&rsquo;s cowl,
which fell over the breast and shoulders, and often bore
asses&rsquo; ears, and was crested with a cockscomb, while bells
hung from various parts of the attire. The fool&rsquo;s bauble was
a short staff bearing a ridiculous head, to which was sometimes
attached an inflated bladder, by means of which sham
castigations were effected. A long petticoat was also occasionally
worn, but seems to have belonged rather to the idiots
than to the wits.

The fool&rsquo;s business was to amuse his master, to excite him
to laughter by sharp contrast, to prevent the over-oppression
of state affairs, and, in harmony with a well-known physiological
precept, by his liveliness at meals to assist his lord&rsquo;s digestion.
The names and the witticisms of many of the official jesters at
the courts of Europe have been preserved by popular or state
records. In England the list is long between Hitard, the fool of
Edmund Ironside, and Muckle John, the fool of Charles I.,
and probably the last official royal fool of England. Many are
remembered from some connexion with general or literary history.
Scogan was attached to Edward IV., and later was published
a collection of poor jests ascribed to him, to which Andrew
Boorde&rsquo;s name was attached, but without authority.

Will Sommers, of the time of Henry VIII., seems to have
been a kind-hearted as well as a witty man, and occasionally
used his influence with the king for good and charitable
purposes. Armin, who, in his Nest of Ninnies, gives a full
description of Sommers, and introduces many popular fools,
says of him&mdash;

 
&ldquo;Only this much, he was a poor man&rsquo;s friend.
And helpt the widow often in her end.
The king would ever grant what he would crave.
For well he knew Will no exacting knave.&rdquo;
 

The literature of the period immediately succeeding his death is
full of allusions to Will Sommers.

Richard Tarleton, famous as a comic actor, cannot be omitted
from any list of jesters. A book of Tarleton&rsquo;s Jests was published
in 1611, and, together with his News out of Purgatory, was reprinted
by Halliwell Phillips for the Shakespeare Society in 1844.
Archie Armstrong, for a too free use of wit and tongue against
Laud, lost his office and was banished the court. The conduct
of the archbishop against the poor fool is not the least item of the
evidence which convicts him of a certain narrow-mindedness
and pettiness. In French history, too, the figure of the court-jester
flits across the gay or sombre scene at times with fantastic
effect. Caillette and Triboulet are well-known characters of the
times of Francis I. Triboulet appears in Rabelais&rsquo;s romance,
and is the hero of Victor Hugo&rsquo;s Le Roi s&rsquo;amuse, and, with some
changes, of Verdi&rsquo;s opera Rigoletto; while Chicot, the lithe and
acute Gascon, who was so close a friend of Henry III., is portrayed
with considerable justness by Dumas in his Dame de
Monsoreau. In Germany Rudolph of Habsburg had his Pfaff
Cappadox, Maximilian I. his Kunz von der Rosen (whose features,
as well as those of Will Sommers, have been preserved by the
pencil of Holbein), and many a petty court its jester after jester.

Late in the 16th century appeared Le Sottilissime Astuzie di
Bertoldo, which is one of the most remarkable books ever written
about a jester. It is by Giulio Cesare Croce, a street musician of
Bologna, and is a comic romance giving an account of the
appearance at the court of Alboin king of the Lombards of a
peasant wonderful in ugliness, good sense and wit. The book
was for a time the most popular in Italy. A great number of
editions and translations appeared, and it was even versified.
Though fiction, both the character and the career of Bertoldo
are typical of the jester. That the private fool existed as late
as the 18th century is proved by Swift&rsquo;s epitaph on Dicky Pearce,
the earl of Suffolk&rsquo;s jester.

FOOLS, FEAST OF (Lat. festum stultorum, fatuorum, follorum,
Fr. fÃªte des fous), the name for certain burlesque quasi-religious
festivals which, during the middle ages, were the ecclesiastical
counterpart of the secular revelries of the Lord of Misrule. The
celebrations are directly traceable to the pagan Saturnalia of
ancient Rome, which in spite of the conversion of the Empire
to Christianity, and of the denunciation of bishops and ecclesiastical
councils, continued to be celebrated by the people on the
Kalends of January with all their old licence. The custom,
indeed, so far from dying out, was adopted by the barbarian
conquerors and spread among the Christian Goths in Spain,
Franks in Gaul, Alemanni in Germany, and Anglo-Saxons in
Britain. So late as the 11th century Bishop Burchard of Worms
thought it necessary to fulminate against the excesses connected
with it (Decretum, xix. c. 5, Migne, Patrologia lat. 140, p. 965).
Then, just as it appears to have been sinking into oblivion among
the people, the clergy themselves gave it the character of a
specific religious festival. Certain days seem early to have been
set apart as special festivals for different orders of the clergy:
the feast of St Stephen (December 26) for the deacons, St John&rsquo;s
day (December 27) for the priests, Holy Innocents&rsquo; Day for the
boys, and for the sub-deacons Circumcision, the Epiphany,
or the 11th of January. The Feast of Holy Innocents became
a regular festival of children, in which a boy, elected by his
fellows of the choir school, functioned solemnly as bishop or
archbishop, surrounded by the elder choir-boys as his clergy,
while the canons and other clergy took the humbler seats. At
first there is no evidence to prove that these celebrations were
characterized by any specially indecorous behaviour; but in the
12th century such behaviour had become the rule. In 1180
Jean Beleth, of the diocese of Amiens, calls the festival of the
sub-deacons festum stultorum (Migne, Patrol. lat. 202, p. 79).
616
The burlesque ritual which characterized the Feast of Fools
throughout the middle ages was now at its height. A young
sub-deacon was elected bishop, vested in the episcopal insignia
(except the mitre) and conducted by his fellows to the sanctuary.
A mock mass was begun, during which the lections were read
cum farsia, obscene songs were sung and dances performed,
cakes and sausages eaten at the altar, and cards and dice played
upon it.

This burlesquing of things universally held sacred, though
condemned by serious-minded theologians, conveyed to the
child-like popular mind of the middle ages no suggestion of
contempt, though when belief in the doctrines and rites of
the medieval Church was shaken it became a ready instrument
in the hands of those who sought to destroy them. Of this kind
of retribution Scott in The Abbot gives a vivid picture, the
Protestants interrupting the mass celebrated by the trembling
remnant of the monks in the ruined abbey church, and insisting
on substituting the traditional Feast of Fools.

This naive temper of the middle ages is nowhere more conspicuously
displayed than in the Feast of the Ass, which under
various forms was celebrated in a large number of churches
throughout the West. The ass had been introduced into the
ritual of the church in the 9th century, representing either
Balaam&rsquo;s ass, that which stood with the ox beside the manger
at Bethlehem, that which carried the Holy Family into Egypt,
or that on which Christ rode in triumph into Jerusalem. Often
the ass was a mere incident in the Feast of Fools; but sometimes
he was the occasion of a special festival, ridiculous enough to
modern notions, but by no means intended in an irreverent
spirit. The three most notable celebrations of the Feast of the
Ass were at Rouen, Beauvais and Sens. At Rouen the feast
was celebrated on Christmas Day, and was intended to represent
the times before the coming of Christ. The service opened with
a procession of Old Testament characters, prophets, patriarchs
and kings, together with heathen prophets, including Virgil,
the chief figure being Balaam on his ass. The ass was a hollow
wooden effigy, within which a priest capered and uttered prophecies.
The procession was followed, inside the church, by
a curious combination of ritual office and mystery play, the text
of which, according to the Ordo processionis asinorum secundum
Rothomagensem usum, is given in Du Cange.

Far more singular was the celebration at Beauvais, which was
held on the 14th of January, and represented the flight into
Egypt. A richly caparisoned ass, on which was seated the
prettiest girl in the town holding in her arms a baby or a large
doll, was escorted with much pomp from the cathedral to the
church of St Ã‰tienne. There the procession was received by
the priests, who led the ass and its burden to the sanctuary.
Mass was then sung; but instead of the ordinary responses to
the Introit, Kyrie, Gloria, &amp;c., the congregation chanted &ldquo;Hinham&rdquo;
(Hee-haw) three times. The rubric of the mass for this
feast actually runs: In fine Missae Sacerdos versus ad populum
vice, Ite missa est, Hinhannabit: populus vero vice, Deo Gratias,
ter respondebit Hinham, Hinham, Hinham (At the close of the
mass the priest turning to the people instead of saying, Ite missa
est, shall bray thrice: the people, instead of Deo gratias, shall
thrice respond Hee-haw, Hee-haw, Hee-haw).

At Sens the Feast of the Ass was associated with the Feast
of Fools, celebrated at Vespers on the Feast of Circumcision.
The clergy went in procession to the west door of the church,
where two canons received the ass, amid joyous chants, and led
it to the precentor&rsquo;s table. Bizarre vespers followed, sung
falsetto and consisting of a medley of extracts from all the
vespers of the year. Between the lessons the ass was solemnly
fed, and at the conclusion of the service was led by the precentor
out into the square before the church (conductus ad ludos);
water was poured on the precentor&rsquo;s head, and the ass became
the centre of burlesque ceremonies, dancing and buffoonery
being carried on far into the night, while the clergy and the
serious-minded retired to matins and bed.

Various efforts were made during the middle ages to abolish
the Feast of Fools. Thus in 1198 the chapter of Paris suppressed
its more obvious indecencies; in 1210 Pope Innocent III.
forbade the feasts of priests, deacons and sub-deacons altogether;
and in 1246 Innocent IV. threatened those who disobeyed this
prohibition with excommunication. How little effect this had,
however, is shown by the fact that in 1265 Odo, archbishop of
Sens, could do no more than prohibit the obscene excesses of
the feast, without abolishing the feast itself; that in 1444 the
university of Paris, at the request of certain bishops, addressed
a letter condemning it to all cathedral chapters; and that King
Charles VII. found it necessary to order all masters in theology
to forbid it in collegiate churches. The festival was, in fact,
too popular to succumb to these efforts, and it survived throughout
Europe till the Reformation, and even later in France;
for in 1645 Mathurin de NeurÃ© complains in a letter to Pierre
Gassendi of the monstrous fooleries which yearly on Innocents&rsquo;
Day took place in the monastery of the Cordeliers at Antibes.
&ldquo;Never did pagans,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;solemnize with such extravagance
their superstitious festivals as do they.... The lay-brothers,
the cabbage-cutters, those who work in the kitchen ...
occupy the places of the clergy in the church. They don the
sacerdotal garments, reverse side out. They hold in their hands
books turned upside down, and pretend to read through spectacles
in which for glass have been substituted bits of orange-peel.&rdquo;

FOOLSCAP, the cap, usually of conical shape, with a cockscomb
running up the centre of the back, and with bells attached, worn
by jesters and fools (see Fool); also a conical cap worn by
dunces. The name is given to a size of writing or printing paper,
varying in size from 12 Ã— 15 in. to 17 Ã— 13-1/2 in. (see Paper). The
name is derived from the use of a &ldquo;fool&rsquo;s cap&rdquo; as a watermark.
A German example of the watermark dating from 1479 was
exhibited in the Caxton Exhibition (1877). The New English
Dictionary finds no trustworthy evidence for the introduction of
the watermark by a German, Sir John Spielmann, at his paper-mill
at Dartford in 1580, and states that there is no truth in the
familiar story that the Rump Parliament substituted a fool&rsquo;s cap
for the royal arms as a watermark on the paper used for the
journals of parliament.



FOOL&rsquo;S PARSLEY, in botany, the popular name for Aethusa
Cynapium, a member of the family Umbelliferae, and a common
weed in cultivated ground. It is an annual herb, with a fusiform
root and a smooth hollow branched stem 1 to 2 ft. high, with
much divided (ternately pinnate) smooth leaves and small compound
umbels of small irregular white flowers. The plant has a
nauseous smell, and, like other members of the order (e.g. hemlock,
water-drop wort), is poisonous.



FOOT, the lower part of the leg, in vertebrate animals consisting
of tarsus, metatarsus and phalanges, on which the body rests
when in an upright position, standing or moving (see Anatomy:
Superficial and Artistic; and Skeleton: Appendicular). The
word is also applied to such parts of invertebrate animals as serve
as a foot, either for movement or attachment to a surface.
&ldquo;Foot&rdquo; is a word common in various forms to Indo-European
languages, Dutch, voet, Ger. Fuss, Dan. fod, &amp;c. The Aryan root
is pod-, which appears in Sans. p&#363;d, Gr. &#960;&#959;&#8166;&#962;, &#960;&#959;&#948;&#972;&#962; and Lat.
pes, pedis. From the resemblance to the foot, in regard to its
position, as the base of anything, or as the lowest member of the
body, or in regard to its function of movement, the word is
applied to the lowest part of a hill or mountain, the plate of a
sewing-machine which holds the material in position, to the part
of an organ pipe below the mouth, and the like. In printing the
bottom of a type is divided by a groove into two portions known
as &ldquo;feet.&rdquo; Probably referring to the beating of the rhythm
with the foot in dancing, the Gr. &#960;&#959;&#8166;&#962; and Lat. pes were applied in
prosody to a grouping of syllables, one of which is stressed,
forming the division of a verse. &ldquo;Foot,&rdquo; i.e. foot-soldier, was
617
formerly, with an ordinal number prefixed, the name of the
infantry regiments of the British army. It is now superseded by
territorial designations, but it still is used in the four regiments of
the infantry of the Household, the Foot Guards. As a lineal
measure of length the &ldquo;foot&rdquo; is of great antiquity, estimated
originally by the length of a man&rsquo;s foot (see Weights and
Measures). For the ceremonial washing of feet, see Maundy
Thursday.



FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE (Aphthous Fever, Epizootic
Aphtha, Eczema Epizootica), a virulent contagious and inoculable
malady of animals, characterized by initial fever, followed by the
formation of vesicles or blisters on the tongue, palate and lips,
sometimes in the nostrils, fourth stomach and intestine of
cattle, and on parts of the body where the skin is thin, as on the
udder and teats, between the claws, on the heels, coronet and
pastern. The disease begins suddenly and spreads very rapidly.
A rise of temperature precedes the vesicular eruption, which is
accompanied by salivation and a peculiar &ldquo;smacking&rdquo; of the
lips. The vesicles gradually enlarge and eventually break,
exposing a red raw patch, which is very sensitive. The animal
cannot feed so well as usual, suffers much pain and inconvenience,
loses condition, and, if a milk-yielding creature, gives less milk, or,
if pregnant, may abort. More or less lameness is a constant
symptom, and sometimes the feet become very much diseased and
the animal is so crippled that it has to be destroyed. It is often
fatal to young animals. It is transmitted by the saliva and the
discharges from the vesicles, though all the secretions and
excretions are doubtless infective, as well as all articles and
places soiled by them. This disease can be produced by injecting
the saliva, or the lymph of the vesicles, into the blood or the
peritoneal cavity.

If we were to judge by the somewhat vague descriptions of
different disorders by Greek and Roman writers, this disease has
been a European malady for more than 2000 years. But no
reliance can be placed on this evidence, and it is not until we
reach the 17th and 18th centuries that we find trustworthy proof
of its presence, when it was reported as frequently prevailing
extensively in Germany, Italy and France. During the 19th
century, owing to the vastly extended commercial relations
between civilized countries, it has, like the lung-plague, become
widely diffused. In the Old World its effects are now experienced
from the Caspian Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. Hungary, Lower
Austria, Bohemia, Saxony and Prussia were invaded in 1834.
Cattle in the Vosges and in Switzerland were attacked in 1837, and
the disease extending to France, Belgium and Holland, reached
England in 1839, and quickly spread over the three kingdoms (see
also under Agriculture). At this time the importation of
foreign animals into England was prohibited, and it was supposed
that the infection must have been introduced by surplus ships&rsquo;
stores, probably sheep, which had not been consumed during the
voyage. This invasion was followed at intervals by eleven distinct
outbreaks, and since 1902 Great Britain has been free of foot-and-mouth
disease. From the observations of the best authorities it
would appear to be an altogether exotic malady in the west of
Europe, always invading it from the east; at least, this has been
the course noted in all the principal invasions. It was introduced
into Denmark in 1841; and into the United States of America in
1870, from Canada, where it had been carried by diseased cattle
from England. It rapidly extended through cattle traffic from
the state first invaded to adjoining states, but was eventually
extinguished, and does not now appear to be known in North
America. It was twice introduced into Australia in 1872, but was
stamped out on each occasion. It appears to be well known in
India, Ceylon, Burma and the Straits Settlements. In 1870 it
was introduced into the Andaman Islands by cattle imported
from Calcutta, where it was then prevailing, and in the same year
it appeared in South America. In South Africa it is frequently
epizootic, causing great inconvenience, owing to the bullocks
used for draught purposes becoming unfit for work. These cattle
also spread the contagion. It is not improbable that it also
prevails in central Africa, as Schweinfurth alludes to the cattle
of the Dinkas suffering from a disease of the kind.

Though not usually a fatal malady, except in very young
animals, or when malignant, yet it is a most serious scourge.
In one year (1892) in Germany, it attacked 150,929 farms, with
an estimated loss to the owners of Â£7,500,000 sterling. It is
transmissible to nearly all the domestic animals, but its ravages
are most severe among cattle, sheep, goats and swine. Human
beings are also liable to infection.

The treatment of affected animals comprises a laxative diet,
with salines, and the application of antiseptics and astringents to
the sores. The preventive measures recommended are, isolation
of the diseased animals, boiling the milk before use, and thorough
disinfection of all places and substances which are capable of
conveying the infection.



FOOTBALL, a game between two opposing sides played with
a large inflated ball, which is propelled either by the feet alone or
by both feet and hands.

Pastimes of the kind were known to many nations of antiquity,
and their existence among savage tribes, such as the Maoris,
Faroe Islanders, Philippine Islanders, Polynesians and Eskimos,
points to their primitive nature. In Greece the &#7952;&#960;&#943;&#963;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#962;
seems to have borne a resemblance to the modern game. Of this
we read in Smith&rsquo;s Dictionary of Antiquities&mdash;&ldquo;It was the game
at football, played in much the same way as with us, by a great
number of persons divided into two parties opposed to one
another.&rdquo; Amongst the Romans the harpastum, derived from
the Greek verb &#7937;&#961;&#960;&#940;&#950;&#969;, I seize, thus showing that carrying the
ball was permissible, bore a certain resemblance. Basil Kennett,
in his Romae antiquae notitia, terms this missile a &ldquo;larger kind
of ball, which they played with, dividing into two companies and
striving to throw it into one another&rsquo;s goals, which was the
conquering cast.&rdquo; The harpastum was a gymnastic game and
probably played for the most part indoors. The real Roman
football was played with the inflated follis, which was kicked from
side to side over boundaries, and thus must have closely resembled
the modern Association game. Tradition ascribes its introduction
in northern Europe to the Roman legions. It has been played in
Tuscany under the name of Calcio from the middle ages down to
modern times.

Regarding the origin of the game in Great Britain the Roman
tradition has been generally accepted, although Irish antiquarians
assert that a variety of football has been played in Ireland for
over 2000 years. In early times the great football festival of the
year was Shrove Tuesday, though the connexion of the game
with this particular date is lost in obscurity. William Fitzstephen,
in his History of London (about 1175), speaks of the
young men of the city annually going into the fields after dinner
to play at the well-known game of ball on the day quae dicitur
Carnilevaria. As far as is known this is the first distinct mention
of football in England. It was forbidden by Edward II. (1314)
in consequence of &ldquo;the great noise in the city caused by hustling
over large balls (rageries de grosses pelotes).&rdquo; A clear reference is
made &ldquo;ad pilam ... pedinam&rdquo; in the Rotuli Clausarum, 39
Edward III. (1365), memb. 23, as one of the pastimes to be
prohibited on account of the decadence of archery, and the same
thing occurs in 12 Richard II. c. 6 (1388). Both Henry VIII. and
Elizabeth enacted laws against football, which, both then and
under the Stuarts and the Georges, seems to have been violent to
the point of brutality, a fact often referred to by prominent
writers. Thus Sir Thomas Elyot, in his Boke named the Governour
(1531), speaks of football as being &ldquo;nothyng but beastely fury
and extreme violence, whereof proceedeth hurte and consequently
rancour and malice to remayne with thym that be
wounded, wherefore it is to be put in perpetual silence.&rdquo; In
Stubbes&rsquo; Anatomie of Abuses (1583) it is referred to as &ldquo;a
develishe pastime ... and hereof groweth envy, rancour and
malice, and sometimes brawling, murther, homicide, and great
effusion of blood, as experience daily teacheth.&rdquo; Fifty years
later (1634) Davenant is quoted (in Hone&rsquo;s Table-Book) as
remarking, &ldquo;I would now make a safe retreat, but methinks I am
stopped by one of your heroic games called football; which I
conceive (under your favour) not very conveniently civil in the
streets, especially in such irregular and narrow roads as Crooked
618
Lane. Yet it argues your courage, much like your military
pastime of throwing at cocks, since you have long allowed these
two valiant exercises in the streets.&rdquo;

An evidence of its old popularity in Ireland is that the statutes
of Galway in 1527 forbade every other sport save archery,
excepting &ldquo;onely the great foot balle.&rdquo; In the time of Charles
II. football was popular at Cambridge, particularly at Magdalene
College, as is evidenced by the following extract from the register
book of that institution under the date 1679:&mdash;


&ldquo;That no schollers give or receive at any time any treat or collation
upon account of ye football play, on or about Michaelmas Day,
further than Colledge beere or ale in ye open halle to quench their
thirsts. And particularly that that most vile custom of drinking
and spending money&mdash;Sophisters and Freshmen together&mdash;upon ye
account of making or not making a speech at that football time be
utterly left off and extinguished.&rdquo;


It nevertheless remained for the most part a game for the
masses, and never took root, except in educational institutions,
among the upper classes until the 19th century. No clubs or
code of rules had been formed, and the sole aim seems to have
been to drive the ball through the opposing side&rsquo;s goal by fair
means or foul. So rough did the game become that James I.
forbade the heir apparent to play it, and describes the exercise in
his Basilikon Doron as &ldquo;meeter for laming than making able the
users thereof.&rdquo; Both sexes and all ages seem to have taken part
in it on Shrove Tuesday; shutters had to be put up and houses
closed in order to prevent damage; and it is not to be wondered
that the game fell into bad repute. Accidents, sometimes fatal,
occurred; and Shrove Tuesday &ldquo;football-day&rdquo; gradually died
out about 1830, though a relic of the custom still remained in a
few places. For some thirty years football was only practised at
the great English public schools, many of which possessed special
games, which in practically all cases arose from the nature of the
individual ground. Thus the rough, open game, with its charging,
tackling and throwing, which were features of football when it
was taken up by the great public schools, would have been
extremely dangerous if played in the flagged and walled courts
of some schools, as, for example, the old Charterhouse. Hence
at such institutions the dribbling style of play, in which Mr
Montague Shearman (Football, in the &ldquo;Badminton Library&rdquo;) sees
the origin of the Association game, came into existence. Only at
Rugby (later at some other schools), which from the first possessed
an extensive grass field, was the old game preserved and developed,
including even its roughness, for actual &ldquo;hacking&rdquo;
(i.e. intentional kicking of an opponent&rsquo;s legs) was not expressly
abolished at Rugby until 1877. The description of the old school
game at Rugby contained in Tom Brown&rsquo;s School Days has
become classic.

1. Rugby Union.&mdash;We have seen that from early times a
rudimentary game of football had been a popular form of sport in
many parts of Great Britain, and that in the old-established
schools football had been a regular game among the boys. In
different schools there arose various developments of the original
game; or rather, what, at first, must have been a somewhat
rough form of horse-play with a ball began to take shape as a
definite game, with a definite object and definite rules. Rugby
school had developed such a game, and from football played
according to Rugby rules has arisen Rugby football. It was about
the middle of the 19th century that football&mdash;up till that time a
regular game only among schoolboys&mdash;took its place as a regular
sport among men. To begin with, men who had played the game
as schoolboys formed clubs to enable them to continue playing
their favourite school game, and others were induced to join
them; while in other cases, clubs were formed by men who had
not had the experience of playing the game at school, but who
had the energy and the will to follow the example of those who
had had this experience. In this way football was established as a
regular game, no longer confined to schoolboys. When football
was thus first started, the game was little developed or organized.
Rules were very few, and often there was great doubt as to what
the rules were. But, almost from the first, clubs were formed to
play football according to Rugby rules&mdash;that is, according to the
rules of the game as played at Rugby school. But even the
Rugby rules of that date were few and vague, and indeed almost
unintelligible to those who had not been at Rugby school. Still,
the fact that play was according to Rugby rules produced a
certain uniformity; but it was not till the establishment of the
English Union, and the commencement of international matches,
that a really definite code of rules was drawn up.

It is an interesting question to ask why it was that the game of
Rugby school became so popular in preference to the games of
other schools, such as Eton, Winchester or Harrow. It was
probably very largely due to the reputation and success of Rugby
school under Dr Arnold, and this also led most probably to its
adoption by other schools; for in 1860 many schools besides
Rugby played football according to Rugby rules. The rapidity
with which the game spread after the middle of the 19th century
was remarkable. The Blackheath club, the senior club of the
London district, was established in 1860, and Richmond, its great
rival, shortly afterwards. Before 1870, football clubs had been
started in Lancashire and Yorkshire; indeed the Sheffield football
club dates back to 1855. Likewise, in the universities of
Oxford and Cambridge, Rugby football clubs had been formed
before 1870, and by that date the game had been implanted both
in Ireland and South Wales; while in Scotland, before 1860,
football had taken a hold. Thus by 1870 the game had been
established throughout the United Kingdom, and in many
districts had been regularly played for a number of years. Rapid
as, in some ways, had been the spread of the game between the
years 1850 and 1870, it was as nothing to what happened in the
following twenty years; for by 1890 Rugby football, together
with Association football, had become the great winter amusement
of the people, and roused universal interest; while to-day
on any fine Saturday afternoon in winter there are tens of thousands
of people playing football, while those who watch the game
can be counted by the hundred thousand. The causes that led to
this great increase in the game and interest taken in it were,
undoubtedly, the establishment of the various national Unions
and the international matches; and, of course, the local rivalry
of various clubs, together with cup or other competitions prevalent
in certain districts, was a leading factor. The establishment
of the English Union led to a codification of the rules
without which development was impossible.

In the year 1871 the English Rugby Union was founded in
London. This Union was an association of some clubs and schools
which joined together and appointed a committee and officials
to draw up a code of rules of the game. From this beginning the
English Rugby Union has become the governing body of Rugby
football in England, and has been joined by practically all the
Rugby clubs in England, and deals with all matters connected
with Rugby football, notably the choosing of the international
teams. In 1873 the Scottish Football Union was founded in
Edinburgh on the same lines, and with the same objects, while
in 1880 the Welsh Football Union, and in 1881 the Irish Rugby
Football Union, were established as the national Unions of Wales
and Ireland, though in both countries there had been previously
Unions not thoroughly representative of the country. All
these Unions became the chief governing body within their own
country, and one of their functions was to make the rules and
laws of the game; but as this had been done to start with by
the English Union, the others adopted the English rules, with
amendments to them from time to time. This state of affairs
had one element of weakness&mdash;viz. that since all the Unions made
their own rules, if ever a dispute should arise between any of
them, a dead-lock was almost certain to ensue. Such a dispute
did occur in 1884 between the English and Scottish Unions.
This dispute eventually turned on the question of the right of
the English Union to make and interpret the rules of the game,
and to be the paramount authority in the game, and superior
to the other Unions. Scotland, Ireland and Wales resisted this
claim, and finally, in 1889, Lord Kingsburgh and Major Marindin
were appointed as a commission to settle the dispute. The
result was the establishment of the International Board, which
consists of representatives from each Union&mdash;six from England,
two from each of the others&mdash;whose duties were to settle any
619
question that might arise between the different Unions, and to
settle the rules under which international matches were to be
played, these rules being invariably adopted by the various
Unions as the rules of the game.

With the establishment of the International Board the organization
of the game was complete. Still harmony did not prevail,
and in 1895 occurred a definite disruption. A number of leading
clubs in Yorkshire and Lancashire broke off from the English
Union and formed the Northern Union, which since that date
has had many accessions, and has become the leading body in
the north of England. The question in dispute was the payment
of players. Football was originally played by men for the sheer
love of the game, and by men who were comparatively well-to-do,
and who could give the time to play it; but with the increasing
popularity of the game it became the pastime of all classes of the
people, and clubs began to grow rich by &ldquo;drawing big gates,&rdquo;&mdash;that
is, large numbers of spectators, frequently many thousands
in number, paid for the privilege of witnessing the match. In
these circumstances the temptation arose to reimburse the player
for any out-of-pocket expenses he might be put to for playing
the game, and thus it became universally recognized as legitimate
to pay a player&rsquo;s expenses to and from a match. But in the
case of working men it often meant that they lost part of their
weekly wage when they had to go a distance to play a match,
or to go on tour with their club&mdash;that is, go off for a few days and
play one or two matches in different parts of the country&mdash;and
consequently the claim was made on their behalf to recoup them
for their loss of wage; while at the same time rich clubs began
to be willing to offer inducements to good players to join their
club, and these inducements were generally most acceptable
in the form of money. In Association football (see below)
professionalism&mdash;i.e. the hiring and paying of a player for his
services&mdash;had been openly recognized. A large section of the
English Union&mdash;the amateur party&mdash;would not tolerate anything
that savoured of professionalism, and regarded payments made
to a player for broken time as illegitimate. The result was the
formation of the Northern Union, which allowed such payments,
and has practically recognized professionalism. This body has
also somewhat altered the laws of the game, and reduced the
number of players constituting a team from fifteen to thirteen.
In Scotland and Ireland Rugby footballers are strongly amateur;
but wherever Rugby football is the popular game of the artisan
the professional element is strong.

Besides legislation, one of the functions of the Unions is to
select international teams. On the 27th of March 1871 the first
international match was played between England and Scotland
in Edinburgh. This was a match between teams picked from
English and Scottish players. These matches from the first
roused widespread interest, and were a great stimulus to the
development of the game. With the exception of a few years,
when there were disputes between their respective Unions, all
the countries of the United Kingdom have annually played one
another&mdash;England having played Scotland since 1871, Ireland
since 1875 and Wales since 1880. Scotland commenced playing
Ireland in 1877 and Wales in 1883, while Ireland and Wales
met first in 1882 and then in 1884, and since 1887 have played
annually. The qualifications of a player for any country were
at first vaguely considered to be birth; but they were never
definitely settled, and there has been a case of a player playing
for two countries. In 1894, however, the International Board
decided that no player was to play for more than one country,
and this has been the only pronouncement on the question; and
though birth is still looked upon as the main qualification, it is
not essential. Though international matches excite interest
throughout the United Kingdom, the matches between two rival
clubs arouse just as much excitement in their district, particularly
when the clubs may be taken as representatives of two
neighbouring rival towns. But when to this rivalry there is
added the inducement to play for a cup, or prize, the excitement
is much more intense. Among Rugby players cup competitions
have never been so popular as among Association, but the competition
for the Yorkshire Cup was very keen in the days before
the establishment of the Northern Union, and this undoubtedly
was the main cause of the popularity of the game in that county.
Similarly the competition for the South Wales Cup from 1878
to 1887 did a great deal to establish the game in that country.
The method of carrying on these competitions is, that all the
clubs entered are drawn by lot, in pairs, to play together in the
first round; the winners of these ties are then similarly drawn
in pairs for the next round, until for the final round there is
only one pair left, the winner of which takes the cup. An elaboration
of this competition is the &ldquo;League system&rdquo; of the Association
game. This, likewise, has not been popular with Rugby players.
Still it exists in some districts, especially where clubs are anxious
to draw big gates. In the League system a certain number of
clubs form a league to play one another twice each season; two
points are counted for a win and one for a draw. The club
which at the end of the season comes out with most points wins
the competition. The advantage of this system over a cup
competition is, that interest is kept up during the whole season,
and one defeat does not debar a club from eventually coming
out first.

It is said that wherever Britons go they take their games with
them, and this has certainly been the case with Rugby football,
especially in New Zealand, South Africa and Australia. An
interchange of football visits between these colonies and the
motherland is now an important feature in the game. These
tours date from 1888, when an English team visited Australia
and New Zealand. In the following season, 1889, a team of
New Zealanders, some of whom were native Maories, came over
to England, and by their play even then indicated how well the
grammar of the game had been studied in that colony. Subsequently
several British teams visited at intervals New Zealand
and Australia, and in 1905 New Zealand sent home a team
which eclipsed anything previously accomplished. They played
altogether thirty-three matches, including fixtures with England,
Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and only sustained one defeat, viz.
by a try in their match with Wales, a record which speaks for
itself. In 1908 a combined team of English and Welsh players
toured in New Zealand and Australia, and also visited Canada
on their way home. The team was not so strong as could have
been wished, and though they did fairly well in Australia, they
lost all three &ldquo;test matches&rdquo; against New Zealand. In South
Africa the game is followed with equal enthusiasm, and the play
is hardly inferior, if at all, to that of the New Zealanders. The
first British team to visit the Cape went in 1891 through the
generosity of Cecil Rhodes, who guaranteed the undertaking
against loss. Teams were also sent out in 1896 and 1903; the
result of matches played in each visit showing the steady improvement
of the colonists. In 1906 the South Africans paid their first
visit to England, and the result of their tour proved them to
be equally formidable with the New Zealanders. England
managed to draw with them, but Scotland was the only one
of the home Unions to gain a victory. The success of these
colonial visits, more especially financially, created a development
very foreign to the intentions of their organizers. The Northern
Union as a professional body had drifted into a somewhat parlous
state, through suffering on the one hand from a lack of international
matches, and on the other from the competition of
Association professional teams. The great financial success
resulting from the New Zealand tour of 1905 roused the attention
of the Northern Union authorities, and they quickly entered
into negotiations with New Zealand players to collect a team
who would come over and play the Northern Union clubs, the
visiting players themselves taking a share of the gate-money.
For this purpose a team of New Zealanders toured the north of
England in 1907, and their action caused the introduction of
professional or Northern Union football in both New Zealand
and Australia.

The spread of the game has not, however, been confined to
English-speaking races. In France it has found fruitful soil,
and numerous clubs exist in that country. Since 1906 international
matches have been played between France and England,
and the energy of French players, coupled with their national
620
Ã©lan, makes them formidable opponents. The Rugby code has
also obtained a firm footing in Canada, India, Ceylon and the
Argentine.

The game itself is essentially a winter pastime, as two requisite
conditions for its enjoyment are a cool atmosphere and a soft
though firm turf. The field of play is an oblong, not more than
110 yds. long nor more than 75 yds. broad, and it usually approximates
to these dimensions. The boundaries are marked by lines,
called touch-lines, down the sides, and goal-lines along the ends.
The touch-lines are continued beyond the goal-lines for a distance
of not more than 25 yds.; and parallel to the goal-line and
behind it, at a distance of not more than 25 yds., is drawn a line
called the dead-ball line, joining the ends of the touch-lines
produced. On each goal-line, at an equal distance from the touch-lines,
are erected two posts, termed goal-posts, exceeding 11 ft.
in height, and generally much more&mdash;averaging perhaps from
20 to 30 ft. from the ground, and placed 18 ft. 6 in. apart. At a
height of 10 ft. from the ground they are joined by a cross-bar;
and the object of the game is to kick the ball over the cross-bar
between the upright posts, and so obtain a goal. The ball
is egg-shaped (strictly an oblate spheroid), and the official
dimensions are&mdash;length, 11 to 11Â¼ in.; length circumference,
30 to 31 in.; width circumference, 25Â½ to 26 in.; weight, 13
to 14Â½ oz. It is made of india-rubber inflated, and covered with
a leather case. Halfway between the two goal-lines there is
generally drawn the half-way line, but sometimes it is marked
by flags on the touch-line; and 25 yds. from each goal-line there
is similarly marked the 25-yds. line. In the original game the
side that had gained the majority of goals won the match, and
if no goal had been scored, or an equal number, the game was
said to be left drawn; but a modification was adopted before
long. A goal can be kicked from the field in the ordinary course
of play; but from the very first a try goal could be obtained by
that side one of whose players either carried the ball across his
opponents&rsquo; goal-line and then touched it down (i.e. on the
ground), or touched it down after it had been kicked across the
goal-line, before any of his opponents. The &ldquo;try&rdquo; is then
proceeded with as follows: the ball is taken out by a member
of the side obtaining the try in a straight line from the spot where
it was &ldquo;touched down,&rdquo; and is deposited in a selected position
on the ground in the field of play, the defending side being all
confined behind their own goal-line until the moment the ball
is so placed on the ground, when another member of the attacking
side endeavours to kick it from the ground (a &ldquo;place kick&rdquo;)
over the bar and between the goal-posts. Frequently a goal
is kicked; very often not. The modification first allowed was
to count that side the winner which had gained the majority
of tries, provided no goal or an equal number of goals had been
scored; but a majority of one goal took precedence of any
number of tries. But this, too, was afterwards abolished, and
a system of points instituted by which the side with the majority
of points wins. The numerical value, however, of goals and
tries has undergone several changes, the system in 1908 being
as follows:&mdash;A try counts 3 points. A goal from a try (in which
case the try shall not count) 5 points. A dropped goal (except
from a mark or a penalty kick) 4 points; a dropped goal being a
goal obtained by a player who drops the ball from his hands and
kicks it the moment it rises off the ground, as in the &ldquo;half-volley&rdquo;
at cricket or tennis. A goal from a mark or penalty kick 3 points.
Under the Northern Union code any sort of goal counts 2 points,
a try 3 points; but if a try be converted into a goal, both try
and goal count, i.e. 5 points are scored.

In the game itself not only may the ball be kicked in the
direction of the opponents&rsquo; goal, but it may also be carried; but
it must not be thrown forward or knocked on&mdash;that is, in the
direction of the opponents&rsquo; goal&mdash;though it may be thrown back.
Thus the game is really a combination of football and handball.
The main principle is that any one who is not &ldquo;offside&rdquo; is
in play. A player is offside if he gets in front of the ball&mdash;that
is, on the opponents&rsquo; side of the ball, nearer than a colleague in
possession of the ball to the opponents&rsquo; goal-line; when in this
position he must not interfere with an opponent or touch the
ball under penalty. The leading feature of the game is the
&ldquo;scrummage.&rdquo; In old days at Rugby school there was practically
no limit to the numbers of players on each side, and not infrequently
there would be a hundred or more players on one side.
This was never prevalent in club football; twenty a-side was
the usual number to start with, reduced in 1877 to fifteen a-side,
the number still maintained. In the old Rugby big sides the ball
got settled amidst a mass of players, and each side attempted
to drive it through this mass by shoving, kicking, and otherwise
forcing their way through with the ball in front of them. This
was the origin of the scrummage.

The game is played usually for one hour, or one hour and ten
minutes, sometimes for one hour and a half. Each side defends
each goal in turn for half the time of play. Of the fifteen players
who compose a side, the usual arrangement is that eight are called
&ldquo;forwards,&rdquo; and form the scrummage; two &ldquo;half-backs&rdquo; are
posted outside the scrummage; and four &ldquo;three-quarter-backs,&rdquo;
a little behind the halves, stretch in a line across the field, their
duties being mainly to run and kick and pass the ball to other
members of their own side, and to prevent their opponents from
doing the same. In recent years, owing to the development of
&ldquo;passing,&rdquo; the field position of the half-backs has undergone
a change. One stands fairly close to the scrummage and is
known as the &ldquo;scrum-half,&rdquo; the other takes a position between
the latter and the three-quarters, and is termed the &ldquo;stand-off-half.&rdquo;
Behind the three-quarters comes the &ldquo;full-back&rdquo; or
&ldquo;back,&rdquo; a single individual to maintain the last line of defence;
his duties are entirely defensive, either to &ldquo;tackle&rdquo; an opponent
who has managed to get through, or, more usually, to catch
and return long kicks. Play is started by one side kicking the
ball off from the centre of the field in the direction of the
opponents&rsquo; goal. The ball is then caught by one of the other
side, who either kicks it or runs with it. In running he goes on
until he is &ldquo;tackled,&rdquo; or caught, by one of his opponents, unless
he should choose to &ldquo;pass&rdquo; or throw it to another of his own
side, who, provided he be not offside, may either kick, or run,
or pass as he chooses. The ball in this way is kept moving
until it crosses the touch-line, or goal-line, or is tackled. If the
ball crosses the touch-line both sides line up at right angles
to the point where it crossed the line, and the ball is thrown in
straight either by one of the same side whose player carried
the ball across the touch-line, or, if the ball was kicked or thrown
out, by one of the opposite side. If the ball crosses the goal-line
either a try is gained, as explained above, or if the defending
side touch it down first, the other side retire to the line 25 yds.
from the goal-line, and the defending side kick it up the field.
If the ball is tackled the player carrying the ball gets up from
the ground as soon as possible, and the forwards at once form
the scrummage by putting down their heads and getting ready
to shove against one another. They shove as soon as the ball
is put down between the two front rows. In the scrummage
the object is, by shoving the opponents back or otherwise
breaking away with the ball in front, to carry the ball in the
direction of the opponents&rsquo; goal-line by a series of short kicks
in which the players run after the ball as fast as possible, while
their opponents lie in wait to get the ball, and either by a kick
or other device stop the rush. Instead, however, of the forwards
breaking away with the ball, sometimes they let the ball come
out of the scrummage to their half-backs, who either kick or run
with it, or pass it to the three-quarter-backs, and so the game
proceeds until the ball is once more &ldquo;dead&rdquo;&mdash;that is, brought
to a standstill. The scrummage appears to be an uninteresting
man&oelig;uvre, and a strange relic of bygone times; but it is not
merely a man&oelig;uvre in which weight and strength alone tell&mdash;it
also needs a lot of dexterity in moving the ball with the feet,
applying the weight to best advantage, and also in outflanking
the opposing side, as it were&mdash;usually termed wheeling&mdash;directing
all the force to one side of the scrummage and thus
breaking away. As a rule the game is a lively one, for the players
are rarely at rest; if there is much scrummaging it is called
a slow game, but, if much running and passing, a fast or an open
game. The spectator, unless he be an expert, prefers the open
621
game; but in any case the game is always a hard and exciting
struggle, frequently with the balance of fortune swaying very
rapidly from one side to the other, so that it is a matter of
no surprise to find the British public so ardently attached
to it.

2. Association.&mdash;It is generally supposed that the English
game of Association football is the outcome of the game of football
as played at Cambridge University about the middle of
the 19th century. In October 1863 a committee, consisting of
representatives of the schools of Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Marlborough,
Shrewsbury and Westminster, drew up a code of laws
which settled the fundamental principle of the &ldquo;Association&rdquo;
game, as distinguished from other forms of the game which
permitted of handling and carrying the ball. In Association
football the use of the hands or arms, either for the purpose of
playing the ball or impeding or holding an opponent, is absolutely
prohibited; &ldquo;dribbling&rdquo; or kicking the ball with the feet, and
propelling it by the head or body, are the methods to be adopted.
The Cambridge laws specially provided for &ldquo;kicking&rdquo; the ball.
Laws 13 and 14 provided that &ldquo;the ball, when in play, may be
stopped by any part of the body, but may not be held or hit by
the hands, arms or shoulders. All charging is fair, but holding,
pushing with the hands, tripping up and shinning are forbidden.&rdquo;

The laws of Association football first took practical shape
as the outcome of a meeting held on the 26th of October 1863
at the Freemasons&rsquo; Tavern, London. The clubs which sent
delegates were representative of all classes of football then
played. The meeting was a momentous one, for not only was
the foundation laid of the Football Association, the national
association which has since then controlled the game in England,
but as the outcome of the differences of opinion which existed
as to &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; being permissible under the laws, the representatives
who favoured the inclusion of the practice, which is
now so roundly condemned in both the Association and Rugby
games, withdrew and formed the Rugby Union.

The Cambridge laws were considered by the committee of the
Football Association at their meeting on the 24th of November
1863. They took the view that those laws &ldquo;embraced the true
principles of the game with the greatest simplicity&rdquo;; the laws
were &ldquo;officially&rdquo; passed on the 1st of December 1863, and the
first publication was made in Bell&rsquo;s Life four days later. These
laws have from time to time been modified, but the principles
as laid down in 1863 have been adhered to; and the Association
game itself has altered very little since 1880. The usual dimensions
for a ground are 120 yds. long by 80 yds. wide, and
the goals are 8 yds. in width with a cross-bar from post to post
8 ft. from the ground. The ball is about 14 oz. in weight, and
must be a perfect sphere from 27 to 28 in. in circumference, as
distinguished from the elliptical or egg-shaped Rugby ball. A
rectangular space extending to 18 yds. in front of the goals,
and marked with lines on the ground, constitutes the &ldquo;penalty
area&rdquo;; within which, at a distance of 12 yds. opposite the centre
of the goal, is the &ldquo;penalty kick mark.&rdquo; The boundary lines
at the sides of the field are called the &ldquo;touch-lines&rdquo;; those at
the ends (in the centre of which are the goals) being the &ldquo;goal-lines.&rdquo;
The game is started by a place kick from the centre of
the field of play, and none of the opposite side is allowed to
approach within 10 yds. of the ball when it is kicked off. When
the ball passes over the touch line it has to be thrown in by one
of the opposite side, and can be returned into the field of play
in any direction. If it passes over the goal-line at any time
without touching one of the defending side, it has to be kicked
out by the goalkeeper or one of the backs from a line marked in
front of goal, the spot selected being in front of the post nearest
the point where the ball left the field of play. But should it
touch one of the defending side in its transit over the goal-line
the attacking side has the privilege of a free kick from the corner
flag (a &ldquo;corner kick&rdquo;). This is often a great advantage, but such
free kick does not produce a goal unless the ball touches one of
the other players on its way to the post. Ordinarily a goal is
scored when the ball goes between the goal-posts and under the
cross-bar, not being thrown, knocked on or carried. The regulation
duration of a game is an hour and a half, and ends are
changed at forty-five minutes. The side winning the toss has
the choice of ends or kick-off, and the one obtaining the majority
of goals wins. A goal cannot be scored from a free kick except
when the free kick has been allowed by the referee as a penalty
for certain infringements of the rules by the opposite side; and
if such infringement take place within the penalty area on the
part of a player on the side then defending the goal, and in
the judgment of the referee be intentional, a &ldquo;penalty kick&rdquo;
is awarded to the attacking side. The penalty kick is a free
kick from the penalty kick mark, all the players of the defending
side being excluded from the penalty area, except the goalkeeper,
who is confined to the goal-line; the result, therefore,
being an almost certain goal.

A player is always in play as long as there are three of the
opposite side between him and the opposite goal at the time the
ball is kicked. This &ldquo;offside&rdquo; rule gives much trouble to the
young player, though why it should do so it is not easy to say.
The rule is simple if the words in italics are remembered. The
ball must not be carried, knocked or wilfully handled under any
pretence whatever, save by the goalkeeper, who is allowed to
use his hands in defence of his goal, either by knocking on or
throwing, within his own half of the field of play. Thus far he
is entitled to go in maintaining his goal, but if he carry the ball
the penalty is a free kick. There are other infringements of the
rules which also involve the penalty of a free kick, among them
the serious offences of tripping, hacking and jumping at a player.
Players are not allowed to wear nails in their boots (except such
as have their heads driven in flush with the leather), or metal
plates or gutta-percha, and any player discovered infringing this
rule is liable to be prohibited from taking further part in a
match.

In the early &rsquo;sixties of the 19th century there were probably
not more than twenty-five organized clubs playing Association
football in the United Kingdom, and these were chiefly confined
in the south of England to the universities and public schools.
But whilst the game was being established in the south it was
making steady progress in the north, particularly in Yorkshire,
where the Sheffield Club had been formed as early as 1854. In
1867 the game had become so well established that it was decided
to play an inter-county match. The match, which was played
&ldquo;in the wilds of Battersea Park,&rdquo; terminated in a draw, neither
side having obtained a goal; and it did much to stimulate the
growing popularity of the game. During the season 1870-1871,
only three years later, two matches of an international character
were played between Englishmen and Scotsmen in membership
with the Football Association; they were not, however, recognized
as &ldquo;international&rdquo; matches. The first real international match,
England v. Scotland, was played on the 30th of November 1872
at Partick, Glasgow; the first international match between
England and Wales was played at Kennington Oval in 1879;
and that between England and Ireland at Belfast in 1882. In
1896 amateur international matches were inaugurated with
Germany, Austria and Bohemia; and games are now annually
played with Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, Belgium, Germany,
Holland, Austria and other continental countries. As the outcome
of the international relations with Scotland, Wales and
Ireland, an International Football Association Board was formed
in 1882, when a universal code of laws was agreed upon. Two
representatives from each of the four national associations constitute
the board, whose laws are accepted and observed not
only by the clubs and players of the United Kingdom but in
all countries where the Association game is played. At a meeting
held at Paris on the 21st of May 1904 the &ldquo;International Federation
of Association Football&rdquo; was instituted. It consists of the
recognized national associations in the respective countries:
and its objects are to develop and control Association international
football. The countries in federation are: Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany,
Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.

The small number of clubs taking part in the game in the early
days becomes of interest when compared with the magnitude of
622
the game in the 20th century. Association football has become
one of the most popular of all national sports in the United
Kingdom. It is slowly but surely taking a similar position on the
continent of Europe and is making progress even in the Far East,
Japan being one of its latest adherents. In the season of 1871-1872
the Football Association inaugurated its popular challenge
cup competition which is now competed for by both amateur and
professional clubs. In the first year fifteen clubs entered, all of
which were from the south of England. The first winners of the
cup were the Wanderers, who defeated the Royal Engineers in the
final tie by one goal to nothing. For the first ten years the
competition was mostly limited to the southern clubs, but in the
season of 1881-1882 the Blackburn Rovers were only defeated in
the final tie by the Old Etonians by one goal to nothing. Professionalism
was then unknown in the game, and comparatively
little interest was taken in it except by the players themselves.
In the following season of 1882-1883 the cup was for the first time
taken north by the Blackburn Olympic Club, and it remained in
the north for the next nineteen years, until in the season of 1900-1901
it was again brought south by the Tottenham Hotspur
Club, who defeated the Sheffield United Club at Bolton by three
goals to one. In the following season the cup was again taken
north by the Bury Club. In the early days of the competition a
few hundred people only attended the final tie, which for many
years was played at Kennington Oval in London. In the course
of time, however, the interest of the public so largely increased
that it became necessary to seek a ground of greater capacity;
accordingly in 1893 the final was played at Fallowfield, Manchester,
where it was watched by forty thousand people; in 1894
it was played at Everton and in 1895 at the Crystal Palace.
The attendance during the following ten years averaged 80,000
people. The record attendance was in the season of 1900-1901,
when the south were contesting with the north, the spectators
then being upwards of 113,000. In the season of 1908-1909
356 clubs entered the competition; in 1910-11 the number had
increased to 404.

The great development of the game necessitated many changes
in the system of control. About the year 1880 (although contrary
to the rules) a practice of making payment to players crept into
the game in the north of England and slowly developed. After
some years of debate as to the best method of dealing with this
development the Football Association decided in 1885 to legalize
and control the payment of players. The rules define a professional
player as one who receives remuneration of any sort
above his necessary hotel and travelling expenses actually paid, or
is registered as a professional. They further provide that training
expenses not paid by the players themselves will be considered as
remuneration beyond necessary travelling and hotel expenses.
Players competing for any money prizes in football contests are
also considered professionals.

In 1888 the Football League, a combination of professional
clubs of the north and midlands of England, was formed; and a
new scheme was inaugurated for the playing of matches on what
is known as the &ldquo;League&rdquo; principle, the essential advantage of
which is that the clubs in membership of a league agree to play
with each other &ldquo;home and home&rdquo; matches each season, and
also bind themselves under certain penalties to play their best
team in all league matches. Six years later the Southern League
came into existence, primarily with the object of increasing the
interest in the game in the south and west of England. The
Football League and the Southern League very soon had their
imitators, and in 1909 there were upwards of six hundred league
competitions playing under the sanction and control of the Football
Association. The league system also found favour in Scotland,
Wales and Ireland, and has extended to most of the colonies
where Association football is played. In the season of 1893-1894
the Amateur Cup Competition, restricted to amateur clubs in
membership with the Football Association, was inaugurated.
In the first season 32 clubs entered, and the growing popularity
of the competition is shown by the fact that in the season of 1908-1909
there were 229 entries.

The Football Association, founded in 1863 with its eleven clubs,
had in 1909 under its jurisdiction upwards of 10,000 amateur
clubs and a quarter of a million of amateur players, and 400
professional clubs with 7000 professional players. It has also
directly affiliated 52 county, district and colonial associations,
and indirectly in membership a large number of minor associations
which are affiliated through the county and district
associations. The Army Association includes 316 army clubs
in Great Britain and Ireland, together with clubs formed by the
various battalions in India, South Africa, Gibraltar and other
army stations; and the Royal Navy Football Association
comprises all ships afloat having Association football clubs.

The regulations of the Football Association, which is the
recognized administrative and legislative body for the game in
England, make provision for the sanction and control of leagues
and competitions; and its rules, regulations, principles and
practices very largely prevail in all national associations. The
king is the patron, and the council consists of 56 members, a
president, 6 vice-presidents, a treasurer, 10 representatives
elected by the clubs in the ten divisions into which the country is
subdivided, together with representatives of the army, the navy
and of county associations in England which have upwards of
50 clubs in membership, each representative being directly
appointed by his association. In 1905 the Football Association
became incorporated under the Joint Stock Companies Acts, and
as a consequence the word &ldquo;Limited&rdquo; appears in its title. It is
not, however, a trading body; the shareholders are not entitled
to any dividend, bonus or profit, nor may the members of the
council, who are the directors, receive any payment for their
services. The Scottish Football Association is also an incorporated
body with similar powers. Many of the leading clubs of the
United Kingdom have also become incorporated, but under the
regulations of the Football Association they may not pay a larger
dividend to their shareholders than 5%, nor may any of the
directors receive payment for their services.

The whole policy of legislation in Association football of late
years has been naturally to make the game faster by bringing
every one into full play. The great aim accordingly has been
to encourage combination and to discourage purely individual
efforts. In the early days, though there was a certain amount of
cohesion, a player had to rely mainly on himself. Even up to the
middle of the &rsquo;seventies dribbling was looked upon as the great
desideratum; it was the essential for a forward, just as long kicks
were the main object of a back. The development of the game
was of course bound to change all that. The introduction of
passing, long or short, but long in particular, placed the dribbler
pure and simple at a discount, and necessitated methods with
which he was mostly unacquainted. Combined play gradually
came to be regarded as the keynote to success. Instead of one full
back, as was originally the case, and one half-back, the defence
gradually developed by the addition first of a second half, then of
a second full back, and still later of a third half-back, until it came
to show, in addition to the goalkeeper of course, two full backs
and three half-backs. The eight forwards who used to constitute
the attack in the earliest days of the Association have been
reduced by degrees, as the science of the game became understood,
until they now number only five. The effect of the transition has
been to put the attack and defence on a more equal footing, and
as a natural consequence to make the game more open and
thereby generally more interesting and attractive. Association
football is indeed, from the standpoint of the spectator, a much
brighter game than it was in its infancy, the result of the new
methods bringing every one of the eleven players into full relief
throughout the game. The players who, as a rule, make or mar
the success of a side in modern football are the centre forward
and the centre half-back. They are the pivot on which the
attack and the defence respectively turn. Instead of close
dribbling and following up, the new formation makes for accuracy
of passing among the forwards, with intelligent support from the
half-backs. The net result is practically the effective combination
of the whole side. To do his part as it ought to be done
every member of an eleven must work in harmony with the rest,
and on a definite system, in all cases subordinating his own
623
methods and personal interests to promote the general well-being
of the side.

United States.&mdash;In America the game of football has been
elaborated far more than elsewhere, and involves more complications
than in England. From colonial times until 1871 a kind of
football generally resembling the English Association game was
played on the village greens and by the students of colleges and
academies. There was no running with the
ball, but dribbling, called &ldquo;babying,&rdquo; was
common. In 1871 a code of rules was drawn
up, but they were unsatisfactory and not invariably
observed. &ldquo;Batting the ball,&rdquo; i.e.
striking the ball forward with the fists, was
allowed. There were two backs, sixteen
rushers or forwards, and two rovers or &ldquo;peanutters,&rdquo;
who lurked near the opponents&rsquo; goal.
During this period the first international football
game was played at Yale between the
college team and one made up of old Etonians,
the rules being a compromise between the
American and the English.

English Rugby, introduced from Canada,
was first played at Harvard University, and
in 1875 a match under a compromise set of
rules, taken partly from the Rugby Union and
partly from the existing American game, was
played with Yale. The following year Yale
adopted the regular Rugby Union rules, and
played Harvard under these. Later, several
other colleges adopted these English rules.
Absence of tradition necessitated expansion
of these laws, and a convention of colleges
was assembled. Thenceforward annual conventions
were held, which from time to time
altered and amplified the rules. A college
association was formed, and the game grew in
popularity. Public criticism of the roughness
shown in the play early threatened its existence;
indeed at one time the university
authorities compelled Harvard to abstain
from the annual game with Yale. Changes
in the rules were introduced, and the game has been characterized
by less roughness and by increased skill. It has become the
most popular autumn game in the United States, the principal
university matches often attracting crowds of 35,000 and even
40,000 spectators. The association subsequently disbanded, but
a Rules Committee, invited by the University Athletic Club of
New York, made the necessary changes in the rules from time
to time, and these have been accepted by the country at large.
In the West associations were formed; but the game in the East
is played principally under separate agreements between the
contesting universities, all using, however, one code of rules.
Later this Rules Committee amalgamated with a new committee
of wider representation. Amateur athletic clubs as
well as public and private schools have also taken up the
game. The American football season lasts from the middle
of September to the first of December only, owing to the
severity of the American winter. Professional football is not
played in America.

The American Rugby game is played by teams of eleven men
on a field of 330 ft. long and 160 ft. wide, divided by chalk lines
into squares with sides 5 yds. long, leaving a strip 5 ft. wide on
each side of the field. Until 1903 the field was divided by
latitudinal lines only and was therefore popularly called the
&ldquo;gridiron&rdquo;; subsequently it was called the &ldquo;checkerboard.&rdquo;
The end lines are called &ldquo;goal-lines,&rdquo; the side &ldquo;touch-lines.&rdquo;
The two lines 25 yds. from each goal-line, and the middle line, or
55 yard-line, are made broader than the rest. In the middle of
each goal-line is a goal, consisting of two uprights exceeding 20 ft.
in length, set 18 ft. 6 in. apart with a crossbar 10 ft. from the
ground. The ball is in shape and material of the English Rugby
type.



Diagram of Field


The football rules provide that when the ball is put in play in a scrimmage, the
first man who receives the ball, commonly known as the quarter-back, may carry it
forward beyond the line of scrimmage, provided in so doing he crosses such line at least
5 yds. from the point where the snapper-back put the ball in play, and furthermore,
that a forward pass may be made provided the ball passes over the line of scrimmage
at least 5 yds. from the point at which the ball is put in play. The field is marked
off at intervals of 5 yds. with white lines parallel to the goal line, for convenience in
penalizing fouls and for measuring the 10 yds. to be gained in three downs, and also
at intervals of 5 yds. with white lines parallel to the side lines, in order to assist the
referee in determining whether the quarter-back runs according to rule, or whether,
in case of a forward pass, such pass is legally made. Thus the football field is changed
from the gridiron as in 1902, to what now resembles a checkerboard, and the above
diagram shows exactly how the field should be marked. As the width of the field
does not divide evenly into 5 yd. spaces, it is wise to run the first line through the
middle point of the field and then to mark off the 5 yds. on each side from that middle
line. In order to save labour, it may be sufficient to omit the full completion of the
longitudinal lines, as the object of these lines is accomplished if their points of intersection
with the transverse lines are distinctly marked, for instance, by a line a foot long.


A match game consists of two periods (halves) of thirty-five
minutes with an interval of fifteen minutes. Practice games
usually have shorter halves. There are four officials: the umpire,
whose duty it is to watch the conduct of the players and decide
regarding fouls; the referee, who decides questions regarding the
progress of the ball and of play; the field judge who assists
the referee and keeps the time; and the linesman, who (with two
assistants, one representing each eleven) marks the distance
gained or lost in each play.

In scoring, a &ldquo;touchdown&rdquo; (the English Rugby &ldquo;try&rdquo;) counts
5 points, a goal from a touchdown 6 (or one added to the 5 for the
touchdown), a &ldquo;goal from the field,&rdquo; whether from placement or
drop-kick, 4, and a &ldquo;safety&rdquo; (the English Rugby &ldquo;touchdown&rdquo;)
2. Mutatis mutandis, these are made as in English Rugby.
American Rugby differs from the English game, because in the
scrimmage the men are lined up opposite each other, and, although
separated by the length of the ball, are engaged in a constant
man-to-man contest, and also in that a system of &ldquo;interference&rdquo;
is allowed. Furthermore, a player in the American game is put
&ldquo;on side&rdquo; when a kicked ball strikes the ground; and forward
passing, i.e. throwing the ball toward the opponents&rsquo; goal, is
permissible under certain restrictions. The costume usually
consists of a close-fitting jersey with shoulders and elbows padded
and reinforced with leather; short trousers with padded thighs
and knees, heavy stockings and shoes with leather cleats. In the
early period of the game caps were worn, but, as they were
impossible to keep on, they were discarded in favour of the
wearing of long hair, and the &ldquo;chrysanthemum head&rdquo; became
the distinguishing mark of the football player. This, however,
624
proved an inadequate protection, and some players now wear a
&ldquo;head harness&rdquo; of soft padded leather. Substitutes are allowed
in the places of injured players.

The object of the game is identical with that of English Rugby,
and the rules in regard to fair catches, punting, drop-kicking,
place-kicking, goal-kicking, passing and gentlemanly conduct are
practically the same, except that, on a free kick after a fair
catch, the opposing players in the American game may not come
up to the mark but must keep 10 yds. in front of it. In the
American game there is no scrummage in the English sense, nor
is the ball thrown in at right angles after going into touch. The
element of chance in both these methods of play was done away
with by the enunciation of the principle of the &ldquo;possession of the
ball.&rdquo; In America, when the ball has gone out of bounds or a
runner has been tackled and held and the ball downed, the ball is
also put into play by an evolution called a scrimmage, usually
called &ldquo;line-up,&rdquo; which beyond the name bears no resemblance
to the English scrummage. The ball, at every moment of the
game, belongs theoretically either to one side or to the other.
It may be lost by a fumble, or by the side in possession not being
able to make the required distance of 10 yds. in three successive
attempts or by a voluntary kick. In the line-up the seven linemen
(i.e. forwards) face each other on a line parallel to the goal-lines
on the spot where it was ordered down by the referee. The
ball is placed on the ground by the centre-rush, also called the
snapper-back, who, upon the signal being given by his quarter-back,
&ldquo;snaps back&rdquo; the ball to this player, or to the full-back,
by a quick movement of the hand or foot. The moment the ball is
snapped-back it is in play. In every scrimmage it is a foul for the
side having the ball (attacking side) to obstruct an opponent
except with the body (no use may be made of hands or arms);
or for the defending side to interfere with the snap-back. The
defenders may use their hands and arms only to get their
opponents out of the way in order to get at the man with the ball.
Each member of the attacking side endeavours, of course, to
prevent his opponents from breaking through and interfering
with the quarter-back, who requires this protection from his line
in order to have time to pass the ball to one of the backs, whom he
has notified by a signal to be ready. In the United States a
player may be obstructed by an off-side opponent so long as hands
and arms are not used. In the line-up this is called &ldquo;blocking-off&rdquo;
and &ldquo;interference&rdquo; when done to protect a friend running with
the ball. Interference is one of the most important features of
American football. As soon as the ball is passed to one of the
half-backs for a run, for example, round one end of the line, his
interference must form immediately. This means that one or
more of his fellows must accompany and shield him as he runs,
blocking off any opponent who tries to tackle him. The first
duty of the defence against a hostile run is therefore to break up
the interference, i.e. put these defenders out of the play, so that
the runner may be reached and tackled.

The game begins by the captains tossing for choice of kick-off
or goal. If the winner of the toss chooses the goal, on account
of the direction of wind, the loser must kick off and send the
ball at least 10 yds. into the opponents&rsquo; territory from a place-kick
from the 55 yds. line. The two ends of the kicking side,
who are usually fast runners, get down the field after the ball
as quickly as possible, in order to prevent the man who catches
the kick-off from running back with the ball. When the kick-off
is caught, the catcher with the aid of interference runs it back
as far as possible, and as soon as he is tackled and held by his
opponents the ball is down, and a line-up takes place, the ball
being in the possession of the catcher&rsquo;s side, which now attacks.
In order to prevent the so-called &ldquo;block game,&rdquo; once prevalent,
in which neither side made any appreciable progress, the rules
provide that the side in possession of the ball must make at
least 10 yds. in three successive attempts, or, failing to do so,
must surrender the ball to the enemy, or, as it is called, &ldquo;lose
the ball on downs&rdquo;. This is infrequent in actual play, because
if, after two unsuccessful attempts, or partly successful, it becomes
evident that the chances of completing the obligatory 10-yd.
gain on the remaining attempt are unfavourable, a forward
pass or a kick is resorted to, rather than risk losing the ball on
the spot. The kick, although resulting in the loss of the ball,
nevertheless gives it to the enemy much nearer his goal. When
the wind is strong the side favoured by it usually kicks often,
as the other side, not being able to kick back on equal terms,
is forced to play a rushing game, which is always exhausting.
Again, the kicking game is often resorted to by the side that has
the lead in the score, in order to save its men and yet retain the
advantage. The only remaining way to advance the ball is on
a free-kick after a fair catch, as in the English game. The free
kick may be either a punt, a drop-kick or a kick from placement.
Whenever the ball goes over the side line into touch it is brought
back to the point where it crossed the line by the man who
carried it over, or, if kicked or knocked over, by a man of the
side which did not kick it out, and there put in play in one of
two ways. Either it may be touched to the ground and then
kicked at least 10 yds. towards the opponents&rsquo; goal, or it may be
taken into the field at right angles to the line a distance not
less than 5 yds. nor more than 15, and there put down for a
line-up, the player who takes it in first declaring how far he will
go, so that the opposing team may not be caught napping.

Of the seven men in the line, the centre is chosen for his
weight and ability to handle the ball cleanly in snapping back.
He must also, in case the full-back is to make the next play,
be able to throw the ball from between his legs accurately into
the full-back&rsquo;s hands, thus saving the time that would be wasted
if the quarter-back were used as an intermediary. The two
&ldquo;guards,&rdquo; who must also be heavy men, form with the centre
the bulk of the line, protecting the backs in offence, and in defence
blocking the enemy. The two &ldquo;tackles&rdquo; must be heavy
yet active and aggressive men, as they must not only help the
centre and guards in repelling assaults on the middle of the line,
but also assist the ends in stopping runs round the line as well
as those between tackle and end, a favourite point of attack.
The &ldquo;ends&rdquo; are chosen for their activity, sure tackling, fast
running and ability to follow up the ball after a kick. Of the
four players behind the line, the full-back must be a sure
catcher and tackler and a fast runner. The two half-backs
must also be fast runners and good dodgers. One of them is
often chosen for his ability to gain ground by &ldquo;bucking the line,&rdquo;
i.e. plunging through the opposing team&rsquo;s line. He must therefore
be over the average weight, while the other half-back is called
upon to gain by running round the opposing ends. The quarter-back
is the commanding general and therefore the most important
member of his side, as with him lies the choice of plays to be
made when on the attack. Courage, coolness, promptness in
decision and discrimination in the choice of plays are the qualities
absolutely required for this position. As soon as his side obtains
the ball, the quarter-back shouts out a signal, consisting of a
series of numbers or letters, or both, which denotes a certain
play that is to be carried through the moment the ball is snapped
back. A good quarter-back thinks rapidly and shouts his signal
for the next play as soon as a down has been called and while
the scrimmage is forming, so that the plays are run off rapidly
and the enemy is given as little time as possible to concentrate.
The signals, which are secret and often changed to guard them
from being solved by the enemy, are formed by designating
every position and every space in the line, as well as kicks and
other open plays, by a number or letter. Some signals are called
sequence-signals, and indicate a prearranged series of plays for
use in certain emergencies. Every man&oelig;uvre of the attacking
side is carried out by every member of the team, the ideal being
&ldquo;every man in every play every time.&rdquo; As soon as a signal is
given each man should know what part of the ensuing move will
fall to him, in carrying the ball, interfering for the runner, or getting
down the field under a punt. Every team has its own code.

About 1890 the system of interference led to momentum and
mass plays (wedge-formations, tandems, &amp;c.), i.e. to the grouping
of bodies of men behind the line, and starting them before the
ball was snapped back, so that they struck the line with an
acquired momentum that was extremely severe, particularly
when met by men equally determined. These plays caused
625
frequent injuries and led to legislation against them, the most
important law providing for a limitation to the number of men
who could be dropped back of the line, and practically keeping
seven men drawn up in the line.

Penalties are of three kinds: (1) forfeiture of the game, for
refusing to play when directed to do so by the referee, and for
repeated fouls made with the intention of delaying the game;
(2) disqualification of players for unnecessary roughness or
ungentlemanly conduct; and (3) for infringement of rules, for
which certain distances are taken away from the previous
gains of the side making the fouls.

The game resolves itself into a series of scrimmages interspersed
with runs and kicks. The systematized development
of plays places at the disposal of the quarter an infinite variety
of attack, which he seeks to direct at the opposing line with
bewildering rapidity and dash. During the preliminary games
of the season &ldquo;straight football&rdquo; is generally played; that is,
intricate attacks are avoided and kicks and simple plunges
into the line are mainly relied upon. &ldquo;Trick plays,&rdquo; which
comprise all man&oelig;uvres of an intricate nature, are reserved
for later and more important matches. Among these is the
&ldquo;fake (false) kick,&rdquo; in which the full-back takes position as if
to receive the ball for a kick, but the ball is passed to a different
player for a run. Another play of this kind is the &ldquo;wing-shift,&rdquo;
in which some or all of the players on one side of centre suddenly
change to the other side, thus forming a mass and throwing the
opponents&rsquo; line out of balance. To this category belong also
&ldquo;double passes,&rdquo; &ldquo;false passes,&rdquo; &ldquo;delayed passes,&rdquo; &ldquo;delayed
runs&rdquo; and &ldquo;criss-crosses.&rdquo;

Training for football in America resembles that for other
sports in regard to food and hygiene. The coaching systems
at the universities differ, but there is generally a head coach,
who is assisted by graduates, each of whom pays especial
attention to one set of men, one to the men in the centre of the
line, one to the backs, another to the ends, &amp;c. Candidates for
the teams are put through a severe course of practice in catching
punts and hard-thrown passes, in quick starts, falling on the
ball, tackling a mechanical dummy, in blocking, breaking through
the line, and all kinds of kicking, although in matches the kicking
is generally left to one or two men who have shown themselves
particularly expert. Every player is taught to dive for the
ball whenever he sees it on the ground, as possession is of
cardinal importance in American football, and dribbling for this
reason is unknown. When running with the ball the player is
taught to take short steps, to follow his interference, that is, not
isolate himself from his defenders, and neither to slow up nor
shut his eyes when striking the opposing line. Tackling well
below the waist is taught, but it is a foul to tackle below the knee.
The general rule for defensive work of all kinds is &ldquo;play low.&rdquo;

FOOTE, ANDREW HULL (1806-1863), American admiral, was
born at New Haven, Connecticut, on the 12th of September 1806,
his father, Samuel Augustus Foote (1780-1846), being a prominent
lawyer and Whig politician, who as U.S. senator moved in 1829
&ldquo;Foote&rsquo;s resolutions&rdquo; on public lands, in the discussion of which
Daniel Webster made his &ldquo;reply to Hayne.&rdquo; He entered the
U.S. navy in 1822, and was commissioned lieutenant in 1830.
After cruising round the world (1837-1840) in the &ldquo;John Adams,&rdquo;
he was assigned to the Philadelphia Naval Asylum, and later
(1846-1848) to the Boston Navy Yard. In 1849 he was made
commander of the &ldquo;Perry,&rdquo; and engaged for two years in suppressing
the slave trade on the African coast. In 1856, as
commander of the &ldquo;Portsmouth,&rdquo; he served on the East India
station, under Com. James Armstrong, and he captured the
Barrier Forts near Canton. From October 1858 to the outbreak
of the Civil War, he was in charge of the Brooklyn Navy Yard,
becoming a full captain in 1861. In August 1861 he was assigned
to the command &ldquo;of the naval operations upon the Western
waters.&rdquo; His exploit in capturing Fort Henry (on the right
bank of the Tennessee river) from the Confederates, on the 6th
of February 1862, without the co-operation of General Grant&rsquo;s
land forces, who had not arrived in time, was a brilliant success;
but their combined attack on Fort Donelson (12 m. off, on the left
bank of the Cumberland river), whither most of the Fort Henry
garrison had escaped, resulted, before its surrender (Feb. 16),
in heavy losses to Foote&rsquo;s gunboats, Foote himself being severely
wounded. In March-April he co-operated in the capture of
New Madrid (q.v.) and Island No. 10. In June he retired from
his command and in July was promoted rear-admiral, and
became chief of the Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting. On
the 26th of June 1863 he died at New York.

FOOTE, MARY HALLOCK (1847-&emsp;&emsp;), American author and
illustrator, was born in Milton, New York, on the 19th of
November 1847, of English Quaker ancestry. She was educated
at the Poughkeepsie (N.Y.) Female Collegiate Seminary and at
the Cooper Institute School of Design for women, in New York.
In 1876 she married Arthur De Wint Foote, a mining engineer,
and subsequently lived in the mining regions of California,
Idaho, Colorado and Mexico. She is best known for her stories,
in which, as in her drawings, she portrays vividly the rough
picturesque life, especially the mining life, of the West. Some
of her best drawings appear in her own books. Among her
publications are The Led-Horse Claim (1883), John Bodewin&rsquo;s
Testimony (1886), The Chosen Valley (1892), C&oelig;ur d&rsquo;Alene
(1894); The Prodigal (1900), a novelette; The Desert and the
Sown (1902); and several collections of short stories, including
A Touch of Sun and other Stories (1903).



FOOTE, SAMUEL (1720-1777), English dramatist and actor,
was baptized at Truro on the 27th of January 1720. Of his
attachment to his native Cornwall he gives no better proofs
as an author than by making the country booby Timothy (in
The Knights) sound the praises of that county and of its manly
pastimes; but towards his family he showed a loyal and enduring
affection. His father was a man of good family and position.
His mother, Eleanor Goodere, whom he is said in person as
well as in disposition to have strongly resembled, he liberally
supported in the days of his prosperity, and after her death
indignantly vindicated her character from the imputations
recklessly cast upon it by the revengeful spite of the duchess
of Kingston. About the time when Foote came of age, he
inherited his first fortune through the murder of his uncle, Sir
John Dinely Goodere, Bart., by his brother, Captain Samuel
Goodere. Foote was educated at the collegiate school at
Worcester, and at Worcester College, Oxford, distinguishing
himself in both places by mimicry and audacious pleasantries
of all kinds, and, although he left Oxford without taking his
degree, acquiring a classical training which afterwards enabled
him neatly to turn a classical quotation or allusion, and helped
to give to his prose style a certain fluency and elegance.

Foote was &ldquo;designed&rdquo; for the law, but certainly not by
nature. In his chambers at the Temple, and in the Grecian
Coffee-house hard by, he learned to know something of lawyers
if not of law, and was afterwards able to jest at the jargon and
to mimic the mannerisms of the bar, and to satirize the Latitats
of the other branch of the profession with particular success.
The famous argument in Hobson v. Nobson, in The Lame Lovers,
is almost as good of its kind as that in Bardell v. Pickwick.
But a stronger attraction drew him to the Bedford Coffee-house
in Covent Garden, and to the theatrical world of which it was
the social centre. After he had run through two fortunes (the
second of which he appears to have inherited at his father&rsquo;s
death), and had then passed through severe straits, he made
his first appearance on the actual stage in 1744. It is said that
he had married a young lady in Worcestershire; but the traces
of his wife (he affirmed himself that he was married to his washer-woman)
are mysterious, and probably apocryphal.

Foote&rsquo;s first appearance as an actor was made little more than
626
two years after that of Garrick, as to whose merits the critics,
including Foote himself, were now fiercely at war. His own
first venture, as Othello, was a failure; and though he was
fairly successful in genteel comedy parts, and was, after a favourable
reception at Dublin, enrolled as one of the regular company
at Drury Lane in the winter of 1745-1746, he had not as yet
made any palpable hit. Finding that his talent lay neither in
tragedy nor in genteel comedy, he had begun to wonder &ldquo;where
the devil it did lie,&rdquo; when his successful performance of the part
of Bayes in The Rehearsal at last suggested to him the true
outlet for his extraordinary gift of mimicry. Following the
example of Garrick, he had introduced into this famous part
imitations of actors, and had added a variety of other satirical
comment in the way of &ldquo;gag.&rdquo; Engaging a small company
of actors, he now boldly announced for the 22nd of April 1747,
at the theatre in the Haymarket &ldquo;gratis,&rdquo; &ldquo;a new entertainment
called the Diversions of the Morning,&rdquo; to which were to be added
a farce adapted from Congreve, and an epilogue &ldquo;spoken by
the B-d-d Coffee-house.&rdquo; Foote&rsquo;s success in these Diversions
obtained for him the name of &ldquo;the English Aristophanes,&rdquo;
an absurd compliment, declined by Foote himself (see his letter
in The Minor). The Diversions consisted of a series of imitations
of actors and other well-known persons, whose various peculiarities
of voice, gesture, manner or dress were brought directly
before the spectators, while the epilogue introduced the wits
of the Bedford engaged in ludicrous disputation, and specially
&ldquo;took off&rdquo; an eminent physician (probably the munificent
Sir William Browne, whom he afterwards caricatured in The
Devil on Two Sticks), and a notorious quack oculist of the day.
The actors ridiculed in this entertainment having at once procured
the aid of the constables for preventing its repetition, Foote
immediately advertised an invitation to his friends to drink
a dish of tea with him at the Haymarket on the following day at
noon&mdash;&ldquo;and &rsquo;tis hoped there will be a great deal of comedy
and some joyous spirits; he will endeavour to make the morning
as diverting as possible. Tickets for this entertainment to be
had at St George&rsquo;s coffee-house, Temple-Bar, without which no
person will be admitted. N.B.&mdash;Sir Dilbury Diddle will be there,
and Lady Betty Frisk has absolutely promised.&rdquo; The device
succeeded to perfection; further resistance was abandoned
as futile by the actors, whom Foote mercilessly ridiculed in the
&ldquo;instructions to his pupils&rdquo; which the entertainer pretended
to impart (typifying them under characters embodying their
several chief peculiarities or defects&mdash;the massive and sonorous
James Quin as a watchman, the shrill-voiced Lacy Ryan as a
razor-grinder, the charming Peg Woffington, whose tones had
an occasional squeak in them, as an orange-woman crying her
wares and the bill of the play); and Mr Foote&rsquo;s Chocolate,
which was afterwards converted into an evening Tea, became
an established favourite with the town.

In spite of this success, he seems to have contrived to spend
a third fortune, and to have found it necessary to eke out his
means by a speculation in small-beer, as is recorded in an amusing
anecdote told of him by Johnson. But he could now command
a considerable income; and when money came he seems to have
freely expended it in both hospitality and charity. During
his engagements at Covent Garden and at Drury Lane, of which
he was joint-manager, and in professional trips to Scotland, and
more especially to Ireland, he appeared both in comedies of
other authors and more especially in his own. He played Hartop
in his Knights (1749, printed 1754). Taste (1752), in which parts
of the Diversions were incorporated, was followed by some
eighteen pieces, the majority of which were produced at the
Haymarket, the favourite home of Foote&rsquo;s entertainments.
In 1760 he succeeded in obtaining for this theatre a licence from
the lord chamberlain, afterwards (in 1766) converted into a
licence for summer performances for life. The entertainments
were a succession of variations on the original idea of the
Diversions and the Tea. Now, it was an Auction of Pictures
(1748), of part of which an idea may be formed from the second
act of the comedy Taste; now, a lecture on Orators (1754),
suggested by some bombastic discourses given by Macklin in
his old age at the Piazza coffee-house in Covent Garden, where
Foote had amused the audience and confounded the speaker
by interposing his humorous comments. The Orators is preserved
in the shape of a hybrid piece, which begins with a mock
lecture on the art of oratory and its representatives in England,
and ends with a diverting scene of a pot-house forum debate,
to which Holberg&rsquo;s Politician-Tinman can hardly have been a
stranger. At a later date (1773) a new device was introduced
in a Puppet-show. The piece (unprinted) played in this by the
puppets was called Piety in Pattens, and professed to show &ldquo;by
the moral how maidens of low degree might become rich from
the mere effects of morality and virtue, and by the literature
how thoughts of the most commonplace might be concealed
under cover of words the most high flown.&rdquo; In other words,
it was an attack upon sentimental comedy, which was still not
altogether extinguished. An attack upon Garrick in connexion
with the notorious Shakespeare jubilee was finally left out from
the Puppet-show, and thus was avoided a recurrence of the
quarrel which many years before had led to an interchange
of epistolary thrusts, and an imitation by Woodward of the
imitative Foote.

On the whole, the relations between the two public favourites
became very friendly, and on Foote&rsquo;s part unmistakably
affectionate, and they have not been always generously represented
by Garrick&rsquo;s biographers. A comparison between the
two as actors is of course out of the question; but, though
Foote was a buffoon, and his tongue a scurrilous tongue, there
is no authentic ground for the suggestion that his character
was one of malicious heartlessness. Of Samuel Johnson&rsquo;s
opinions of him many records remain in Boswell; when Johnson
had at last found his way into Foote&rsquo;s company (he afterwards
found it to Foote&rsquo;s own table) he was unable to &ldquo;resist&rdquo; him,
and, on hearing of Foote&rsquo;s death, he thought the career just
closed worthy of a lasting biographical record.

Meanwhile most of poor Foote&rsquo;s friendships in high life were
probably those that are sworn across the table, and require
&ldquo;t&rsquo;other bottle&rdquo; to keep them up. It is not a pleasant picture&mdash;of
Lord Mexborough and his royal guest the duke of York,
and their companions, bantering Foote on his ignorance of horsemanship,
and after he had weakly protested his skill, taking him
out to hounds on a dangerous animal. He was thrown and
broke his leg, which had to be amputated, the &ldquo;patientee&rdquo;
(in which character he said he was now making his first appearance)
consoling himself with the reflection that he would now
be able to take off &ldquo;old Faulkner&rdquo; (a pompous Dublin alderman
with a wooden leg, whom he had brought on the stage as Peter
Paragraph in The Orators) &ldquo;to the life.&rdquo; The duke of York
made him the best reparation in his power by promising him
a life-patent for the theatre in the Haymarket (1766); and
Foote not only resumed his profession, as if, like Sir Luke Limp,
he considered the leg he had lost &ldquo;a redundancy, a mere nothing
at all,&rdquo; but ingeniously turned his misfortune to account in two
of his later pieces, The Lame Lover and The Devil on Two Sticks,
while, with the true instinct of a public favourite, making constant
reference to it in plays and prologues. Though the characters
played by him in several of his later plays are comparatively
short and light, he continued to retain his hold over the public,
and about the year 1774 was beginning to think of withdrawing,
at least for a time, to the continent, when he became involved
in what proved a fatal personal quarrel. Neither in his entertainments
nor in his comedies had he hitherto (except in Garrick&rsquo;s
case, and it is said in Johnson&rsquo;s) put any visible restraint upon
personal satire. The Author, in which, under the infinitely
humorous character of Cadwallader, he had brought a Welsh
gentleman of the name of Ap-Rice on the stage, had, indeed,
been ultimately suppressed. But in general he had pursued
his hazardous course, mercilessly exposing to public ridicule and
contempt not only fribbles and pedants, quacks or supposed
quacks in medicine (as in The Devil on Two Sticks), enthusiasts
in religion, such as Dr Dodd (in The Cozeners) and George
Whitefield and his connexion (in The Minor). He had not only
dared the wrath of the whole Society of Antiquaries (in The
627
Nabob), and been rewarded by the withdrawal, from among
the pundits who rationalized away Whittington&rsquo;s Cat, of Horace
Walpole and other eminent members of the body, but had in
the same play attacked a well-known representative of a very
influential though detested element in English society,&mdash;the
&ldquo;Nabobs&rdquo; themselves. But there was one species of cracked
porcelain which he was not to try to hold up to contempt with
impunity. The rumour of his intention to bring upon the stage,
in the character of Lady Kitty Crocodile in The Trip to Calais,
the notorious duchess of Kingston, whose trial for bigamy was
then (1775) impending, roused his intended victim to the utmost
fury; and the means and influence she had at her disposal
enabled her, not only to prevail upon the lord chamberlain to
prohibit the performance of the piece (in which there is no hint
as to the charge of bigamy itself), but to hire agents to vilify
Foote&rsquo;s character in every way that hatred and malice could
suggest. After he had withdrawn the piece, and letters had been
exchanged between the duchess and him equally characteristic
of their respective writers, Foote took his revenge upon the
chief of the duchess&rsquo;s instruments, a &ldquo;Reverend Doctor&rdquo;
Jackson, who belonged to the &ldquo;reptile&rdquo; society of the journalists
of the day, so admirably satirized by Foote in his comedy of
The Bankrupt. This man he gibbeted in the character of Viper
in The Capuchin, under which name the altered Trip to Calais
was performed in 1776. But the resources of his enemies were
not yet at an end; and a discharged servant of Foote&rsquo;s was
suborned by Jackson to bring a charge of assault and apply
for a warrant against him. Though the attempt utterly broke
down, and Foote&rsquo;s character was thus completely cleared, his
health and spirits had given way in the struggle&mdash;as to which,
though he seems to have had the firm support of the better part
of the public, including such men as Burke and Reynolds, the
very audiences of his own theatre had been, or had seemed to
be, divided in opinion. He thus resolved to withdraw, at least
for a time, from the effects of the storm, let his theatre to Colman,
and after making his last appearance there in May 1777, set
forth in October on a journey to France. But at Dover he fell
sick on the day after his arrival there, and after a few hours
died (October 21st). His epitaph in St Mary&rsquo;s church at Dover
(written by his faithful treasurer William Jewell) records that
he had a hand &ldquo;open as day for melting charity.&rdquo; His resting-place
in Westminster Abbey is without any memorial.


Foote&rsquo;s chief power as an actor lay in his extraordinary gift of
mimicry, which extended to the mental and moral, as well as the
mere outward and physical peculiarities of the personages whose
likeness he assumed. He must have possessed a wonderful flexibility
of voice, though his tones are said to have been harsh when his voice
was not disguised, and an incomparable readiness for rapidly assuming
characters, both in his entertainments and in his comedies,
where he occasionally &ldquo;doubled&rdquo; parts. The excellent &ldquo;patter&rdquo;
of some of his plays, such as The Liar and The Cozeners, must have
greatly depended for its effect upon rapidity of delivery. In person
he was rather short and stout, and coarse-featured; but his overflowing
humour is said to have found full expression in the irresistible
sparkle of his eyes.

As a dramatic author he can only be assigned a subordinate rank.
He regarded comedy as &ldquo;an exact representation of the peculiar
manners of that people among whom it happens to be performed;
a faithful imitation of singular absurdities, particular follies, which
are openly produced, as criminals are publicly punished, for the
correction of individuals and as an example to the whole community.&rdquo;
This he regarded as the utile, or useful purpose, of comedy; the
dulce he conceived to be &ldquo;the fable, the construction, machinery,
conduct, plot, and incidents of the piece.&rdquo; For part at least of this
view (advanced by him in the spirited and scholarly &ldquo;Letter&rdquo; in
which he replied, &ldquo;to the Reverend Author of the &lsquo;Remarks,
Critical and Christian,&rsquo; on The Minor&rdquo;), he rather loftily appealed
to classical authority. But he overlooked the indispensableness of
the dulce to the comic drama under its primary aspect as a species
of art. His comic genius was particularly happy in discovering and
reproducing characters deserving of ridicule; and the fact that
he not only took them from real life, but closely modelled them on
well-known living men and women, was not in himself an artistic
sin. Nor indeed was the novelty of this process absolute, though
probably no other comic dramatist has ever gone so far in this
course, or has pursued it so persistently. The public delighted in his
&ldquo;d&mdash;&mdash;d fine originals,&rdquo; because it recognized them as copies; and
he was himself proud that he had taken them from real persons,
instead of their being &ldquo;vamped from antiquated plays, pilfered from
the French farces, or the baseless beings of the poet&rsquo;s brain.&rdquo; But
the real excellence of many of Foote&rsquo;s comic characters lies in the
fact that, besides being incomparably ludicrous types of manners,
they remain admirable comic types of general human nature. Sir
Gregory Gazette, and his imbecile appetite for news; Lady Pentweazel,
and her preposterous vanity in her superannuated charms;
Mr Cadwallader, and his view of the advantages of public schools
(where children may &ldquo;make acquaintances that may hereafter be
useful to them; for between you and I, as to what they learn there,
does not signify twopence&rdquo;); Major Sturgeon and Jerry Sneak;
Sir Thomas Lofty, Sir Luke Limp, Mrs Mechlin, and a score or two
of other characters, are excellent comic figures in themselves,
whatever their origin; and many of the vices and weaknesses exposed
by Foote&rsquo;s vigorous satire will remain the perennial subject of comic
treatment so long as a stage exists. The real defect of his plays lies
in the abnormal weakness of their construction, in the absolute
contempt which the great majority of them show for the invention
or conduct of a plot, and in the unwarrantable subordination of the
interest of the action to the exhibition of particular characters. His
characters are ready-made, and the action is only incidental to them.
With the exception of The Liar (which Foote pretended to have
taken from Lope de Vega, but which was really founded on Steele&rsquo;s
adaptation of Corneille&rsquo;s Le Menteur), and perhaps of The Bankrupt,
there is hardly one of Foote&rsquo;s &ldquo;comedies&rdquo; in which the conception
and conduct of the action rise above the exigencies of the merest
farce. Not that sentimental scenes and even sentimental characters
are wanting, but these familiar ingredients are as incapable of
exciting real interest as an ordinary farcical action is in itself unable
to produce more than transitory amusement. In his earlier plays
Foote constantly resorts to the most hackneyed device of farce&mdash;a
disguise. Of course Foote must have been well aware of the shortcomings
of his rapidly manufactured productions; he knew that if
he might sneer at &ldquo;genteel comedy&rdquo; as suited to the dramatists
of the servants&rsquo; hall, and pronounce the arts of the drama at the great
houses to be &ldquo;directed by the genius of insipidity,&rdquo; he, like the little
theatre where he held sway, was looked upon as &ldquo;an eccentric, a
mere summer fly.&rdquo;

At the same time, he was inexhaustible in the devising of comic
scenes of genuine farce. An oration of &ldquo;old masters,&rdquo; an election
of a suburban mayor, an examination at the College of Physicians,
a newspaper conclave where paragraphs are concocted and reputations
massacred&mdash;all these and other equally happy situations are
brought before the mere reader with unfailing vividness. And
everywhere the comic dialogue is instinct with spirit and vigour,
and the comic characters are true to themselves with a buoyancy
which at once raises them above the level of mere theatrical conventionalism.
Foote professed to despise the mere caricaturing of
national peculiarities as such, and generally used dialect as a mere
additional colouring; he was, however, too wide awake to the
demands of his public not to treat France and Frenchmen as fair
game, and coarsely to appeal to national prejudice. His satire
against those everlasting victims of English comedy and farce, the
Englishman in Paris and the Englishman returned from Paris, was
doubtless well warranted; while at the same time he made fun of
the fact that Englishmen are nowhere more addicted to the society
of their countrymen than abroad. In general, the purposes of
Foote&rsquo;s social satire are excellent, and the abuses against which it
is directed are those which it required courage to attack. The tone
of his morality is healthy, and his language, though not aiming at
refinement, is remarkably free from intentional grossness. He made
occasional mistakes; but he was on the right side in the warfare
against the pretentiousness of Cant and the effrontery of Vice, the
two master evils of the age and the society in which he lived.

The following is a list of Foote&rsquo;s farces or &ldquo;comedies&rdquo; as he calls
them, mostly in three, some in two acts, which remain in print.
The date of production, and the character originally performed by
Foote, are added to the title of each:

The Knights (1748: Hartop, who assumes the character of Sir
Penurious Trifle); Taste (1752), in which part of the Diversions is
incorporated; The Englishman in Paris (1753: Young Buck);
The Englishman returned from Paris (1756: Sir Charles Buck); The
Author (1757: Cadwallader); The Minor (1760: Smirk and Mrs
Cole); The Liar (1762); The Orators (1762: Lecturer); The Mayor
of Garratt (1763: Major Sturgeon and Matthew Mug); The Patron
(1764: Sir Thomas Lofty and Sir Peter Peppercorn); The Commissary
(1765: Mr Zac. Fungus); The Devil upon Two Sticks
(1768: Devil,&mdash;alias Dr Hercules Hellebore); The Lame Lover
(1770: Sir Luke Limp); The Maid of Bath (1771: Mr Flint); The
Nabob (1772: Sir Matthew Mite); The Bankrupt (1773: Sir Robert
Riscounter); The Cozeners (1774: Mr Aircastle); The Capuchin, a
second version of The Trip to Calais, forbidden by the censor (1776:
O&rsquo;Donovan). His dramatic works were collected in 1763-1768.

Bibliography.&mdash;Foote&rsquo;s biography may be read in W. (&ldquo;Conversation&rdquo;)
Cooke&rsquo;s Memoirs of Samuel Foote (3 vols., 1805), which
contain, amidst other matter, a large collection of his good things
and of anecdotes concerning him, besides two of his previously
unpublished occasional pieces (with the Tragedy Ã  la mode, part of
the Diversions, in which Foote appeared as Fustian). From this
source seems to have been mainly taken the biographical information
in the rather grandiloquent essay on Foote prefixed by &ldquo;Jon Bee&rdquo;
628
(John Badcock, fl. 1816-1830, also known as &ldquo;John Hunds&rdquo;) to his
useful edition of Foote&rsquo;s Works (3 vols., 1830). Various particulars
will be found in Tate Wilkinson&rsquo;s Wandering Patentee (York, 1795)
and in other sources. There is an admirable essay on Foote, reprinted
with additions, from the Quarterly Review, in John Forster&rsquo;s
Biographical Essays (1858). A recent life of Foote is by Percy
Fitzgerald (1910).

(A. W. W.)



FOOTMAN, a name given among articles of furniture to a
metal stand, usually of polished steel or brass, and either oblong
or oval in shape, for keeping plates and dishes hot before a dining-room
fire. In the days before the general use of hot-water dishes
the footman possessed definite utility, but although it is still
in occasional use, it is now chiefly regarded as an ornament.
It was especially common in the hardware counties of England,
where it is still frequently seen; the simple conventionality
of its form is not inelegant.



FOOTSCRAY, a city of Bourke county, Victoria, Australia,
on the Saltwater river, 4 m. W. of and suburban to Melbourne.
Pop. (1901) 18,301. The city has large bluestone quarries from
which most of the building stones in Melbourne and the neighbourhood
is obtained; it is also an important manufacturing centre,
with numerous sugar-mills, jute factories, soap works, woollen-mills,
foundries, chemical works and many other minor industries.



FOOT-STALL, a word supposed to be a literal translation of
piÃ¨destal, or pedestal, the lower part of a pier in architecture
(see Base).



FOPPA, VINCENZO, Italian painter, was born near Brescia.
The dates of his birth and death used to be given as 1400 and
1492; but there is now good reason for substituting 1427 and
1515. He settled in Pavia towards 1456, and was the head of a
Lombard school of painting which subsisted up to the advent
of Leonardo da Vinci. In 1489 he returned to Brescia. His
contemporary reputation was very considerable, his merit in
perspective and foreshortening being recognized especially.
Among his noted works are a fresco in the Brera Gallery, Milan,
the &ldquo;Martyrdom of St Sebastian&rdquo;; and a &ldquo;Crucifixion&rdquo; in
the Carrara gallery, Bergamo, executed in 1455. He worked
much in Milan and in Genoa, but many of his paintings are
now lost.

FORAGE, food for cattle or horses, chiefly the provender
collected for the food of the horses of an army. In early usage
the word was confined to the dried forage as opposed to grass.
From this word comes &ldquo;foray,&rdquo; an expedition in search of
&ldquo;forage,&rdquo; and hence a pillaging expedition, a raid. The word
&ldquo;forage,&rdquo; directly derived from the Fr. fourrage, comes from a
common Teutonic origin, and appears in &ldquo;fodder,&rdquo; food for
cattle. The ultimate Indo-European root, pat, cf. Gr. &#960;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;,
Lat. pascere, to feed, gives &ldquo;food,&rdquo; &ldquo;feed,&rdquo; &ldquo;foster&rdquo;; and
appears also in such Latin derivatives as &ldquo;pastor,&rdquo; &ldquo;pasture.&rdquo;



FORAIN, J. L. (1852-&emsp;&emsp;), French painter and illustrator,
was born in 1852. He became one of the leading modern
Parisian caricaturists, who in his merciless exposure of the
weaknesses of the bourgeoisie continued the work which was
begun by Daumier under the second Empire. The scathing
bitterness of his satire is as clearly derived from Daumier as his
pictorial style can be traced to Manet and Degas; but even in
his painting he never suppresses the caustic spirit that drives
him to caricature. He has, indeed, been rightly called &ldquo;a Degas
pushed on to caricature.&rdquo; In his pen-and-ink work he combines
extraordinary economy of means with the utmost power of
expression and suggestion. Forain&rsquo;s popularity dates from the
publication of his ComÃ©die parisienne, a series of two hundred
and fifty sketches republished in book form. He has contributed
many admirable, if sometimes over-daring, pages to the Figaro,
Le Rire, L&rsquo;Assiette au beurre, Le Courrier franÃ§ais, and L&rsquo;Indiscret.
His political drawings for the Figaro were republished
in book form under the title of Doux Pays.



FORAKER, JOSEPH HENSON (1846-&emsp;&emsp;), American
political leader, was born near Rainsboro, Highland county,
Ohio, on the 5th of July 1846. He passed his early life on a
farm, enlisted as a private in the 89th Ohio Volunteer Infantry
in July 1862, served throughout the Civil War, for part of the
time as an aide on the staff of General H.W. Slocum, and in
1865 received a captain&rsquo;s brevet for &ldquo;efficient services during
the campaigns in North Carolina and Georgia.&rdquo; After the war
he spent two years at the Ohio Wesleyan University and two
years at Cornell. In 1869 he was admitted to the Ohio bar and
began practice in Cincinnati. He was a judge of the Cincinnati
Superior Court from 1879 to 1882. In 1883 he was the Republican
candidate for governor of Ohio, but was defeated; in 1885
and 1887, however, he was elected, but was again defeated in
1889. He then for eight years practised law with great success
in Cincinnati. In 1896 he was elected United States senator
to succeed Calvin S. Brice (1845-1898); in 1902 was re-elected
and served until 1909. In the Senate he was one of the aggressive
Republican leaders, strongly supporting the administration of
President M&rsquo;Kinley (whose name he presented to the Republican
National Conventions of 1896 and 1900) in the debates preceding,
during, and immediately following the Spanish-American War,
and later, during the administration of President Roosevelt,
was conspicuous among Republican leaders for his independence.
He vigorously opposed various measures advocated by the
president, and led the opposition to the president&rsquo;s summary
discharge of certain negro troops after the Brownsville raid of
the 13th of August 1906 (see Brownsville, Texas).

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
