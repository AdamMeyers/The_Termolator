<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>


<p>For the privilege of reprinting the rimes gathered
here I am indebted to the courtesy of
the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> and <em>Puck</em>, in whose pages
most of them first appeared. &ldquo;The Lay of St.
Ambrose&rdquo; is new.</p>

<p>One reason for rounding up this fugitive
verse and prisoning it between covers was this:
Frequently&mdash;more or less&mdash;I receive a request
for a copy of this jingle or that, and it is easier
to mention a publishing house than to search
through ancient and dusty files.</p>

<p>The other reason was that I wanted to.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20em;">B. L. T.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p><strong><em>TO MY READERS</em></strong></p>


<p><em>Not merely of this book,&mdash;but a larger company,
with whom, through the medium of the</em> Chicago
Tribune, <em>I have been on very pleasant terms for
several years,&mdash;this handful of rime is joyously
dedicated.</em></p>

<p><strong>THE LAY OF ST. AMBROSE</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em;">
&ldquo;<em>And hard by doth dwell, in St. Catherine&#8217;s cell,</em><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;"><em>Ambrose, the anchorite old and grey.</em>&rdquo;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: 10em;" class="smcap">&mdash;The Lay of St. Nicholas.</span>
</p>


<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Ambrose the anchorite old and grey</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Larruped himself in his lonely cell,</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">And many a welt on his pious pelt</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The scourge evoked as it rose and fell.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">For hours together the flagellant leather</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Went whacketty-whack with his groans of pain;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">And the lay-brothers said, with a wag of the head,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">&ldquo;Ambrose has been at the bottle again.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">And such, in sooth, was the sober truth;</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For the single fault of this saintly soul</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Was a desert thirst for the cup accurst,&mdash;</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A quenchless love for the Flowing Bowl.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">When he woke at morn with a head forlorn</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And a taste like a last-year swallow&#8217;s nest,</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">He would kneel and pray, then rise and flay</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">His sinful body like all possessed.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Frequently tempted, he fell from grace,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And as often he found the devil to pay;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">But by diligent scourging and diligent purging</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He managed to keep Old Nick at bay.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">This was the plight of our anchorite,&mdash;</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An endless penance condemned to dree,&mdash;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">When it chanced one day there came his way</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A Mystical Book with a golden Key.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">This Mystical Book was a guide to health,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That none might follow and go astray;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">While a turn of the Key unlocked the wealth</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That all unknown in the Scriptures lay.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Disease is sin, the Book defined;</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sickness is error to which men cling;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Pain is merely a state of mind,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And matter a non-existent thing.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">If a tooth should ache, or a leg should break,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">You simply &ldquo;affirm&rdquo; and it&#8217;s sound again.</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Cut and contusion are only delusion,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And indigestion a fancied pain.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">For pain is naught if you &ldquo;hold a thought,&rdquo;</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Fevers fly at your simple say;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">You have but to affirm, and every germ</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Will fold up its tent and steal away.</span></p>

<hr style='margin-left: 5em; width: 15%;' />

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">From matin gong to even-song</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Ambrose pondered this mystic lore,</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Till what had seemed fiction took on a conviction</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That words had never possessed before.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
&ldquo;If pain,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;is a state of mind,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">If a rough hair shirt to silk is kin,&mdash;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">If these things are error, pray where&#8217;s the terror</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In scourging and purging oneself of sin?</span></p>

<p>
&ldquo;It certainly seemeth good to me,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">By and large, in part and in whole.</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">I&#8217;ll put it in practice and find if it fact is,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Or only a mystical rigmarole.&rdquo;</span></p>

<hr style='margin-left: 5em; width: 15%;' />

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">The very next night our anchorite</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Of the Flowing Bowl drank long and deep.</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">He argued this wise: &ldquo;New Thought applies</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">No fitter to lamb than it does to sheep.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">When he woke at morn with a head forlorn</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And a taste akin to a parrot&#8217;s cage,</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">He knelt and prayed, then up and flayed</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">His sinful flesh in a righteous rage.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Whacketty-whack on breast and back,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Whacketty-whack, before, behind;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">But he held the thought as he laid it on,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">&ldquo;Pain is merely a state of mind.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Whacketty-whack on breast and back,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Whacketty-whack on calf and shin;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">And the lay-brothers said, with a wag of the head,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">&ldquo;<em>Ain&#8217;t</em> he the glutton for discipline!&rdquo;</span></p>

<hr style='margin-left: 5em; width: 15%;' />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Now every night our anchorite</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Was exceedingly tight when he went to bed.</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">The scourge that once pained him no longer restrained him,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Nor even the fear of an aching head.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">For he woke at morn with a pate as clear</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As the silvery chime of the matin bell;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">And without any jogging he fell to his flogging,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And larruped himself in his lonely cell.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">But the leather had lost its power to sting;</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To pangs of the flesh he was now immune;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">His rough hair shirt no longer hurt,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Nor the pebbles he wore in his wooden shoon.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">When conscience was troubled he cheerfully doubled</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">His matinal dose of discipline;&mdash;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">A deuce of a scourging, sufficient for purging</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The Devil himself of original sin.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Whacketty-whack on breast and back,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Whacketty-whack from morn to noon;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Whacketty-whacketty-whacketty-whack!&mdash;</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Till the abbey rang with the dismal tune.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Deacon and prior, lay-brother and friar</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Exclaimed at these whoppings spectacular;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">And even the Abbot remarked that the habit</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Of scourging oneself might be carried too far.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am pleased to see<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Such penance as never was known before;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">But you raise such a racket in dusting your jacket,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The noise is becoming a bit of a bore.</span></p>

<p>
&ldquo;How would it do if you whaled yourself<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From eight to ten or from one to three?</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Or if &lsquo;More&rsquo; is your motto, pray hire a grotto;</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I know of one you can have rent free.&rdquo;</span></p>

<hr style='margin-left: 5em; width: 15%;' />

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Ambrose the anchorite bowed his head,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And girded his loins and went away.</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">He rented a cavern not far from a tavern,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And tippled by night and scourged by day.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">The more the penance the more the sin,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The more he whopped him the more he drank;</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">Till his hair fell out and his cheeks fell in,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And his corpulent figure grew long and lank.</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">At Whitsuntide he up and died,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">While flaying himself for his final spree.</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">And who shall say whether &#8217;twas liquor or leather</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That hurried him into eternity?</span></p>

<p>
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">They made him a saint, as well they might,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And gave him a beautiful aureole.</span><br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">And&mdash;somehow or other, this circle of light</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Suggests the rim of the Flowing Bowl.</span></p>

<p><strong>IN THE LAMPLIGHT</strong></p>


<p>
 The dinner done, the lamp is lit,<br />
 And in its mellow glow we sit<br />
 And talk of matters, grave and gay,<br />
 That went to make another day.<br />
 Comes Little One, a book in hand,<br />
 With this request, nay, this command&mdash;<br />
 (For who&#8217;d gainsay the little sprite)&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Please&mdash;will you read to me to-night?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>
 Read to you, Little One? Why, yes.<br />
 What shall it be to-night? You guess<br />
 You&#8217;d like to hear about the Bears&mdash;<br />
 Their bowls of porridge, beds and chairs?<br />
 Well, that you shall.... There! that tale&#8217;s done!<br />
 And now&mdash;you&#8217;d like another one?<br />
 To-morrow evening, Curly Head.<br />
 It&#8217;s &ldquo;hass-pass seven.&rdquo; Off to bed!</p>

<p>
 So each night another story:<br />
 Wicked dwarfs and giants gory;<br />
 Dragons fierce and princes daring,<br />
 Forth to fame and fortune faring;<br />
 Wandering tots, with leaves for bed;<br />
 Houses made of gingerbread;<br />
 Witches bad and fairies good,<br />
 And all the wonders of the wood.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;I like the witches best,&rdquo; says she</span><br />
 Who nightly nestles on my knee;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
 And why by them she sets such store,<br />
 Psychologists may puzzle o&#8217;er.<br />
 Her likes are mine, and I agree<br />
 With all that she confides to me.<br />
 And thus we travel, hand in hand,<br />
 The storied roads of Fairyland.</p>

<p>
 Ah, Little One, when years have fled,<br />
 And left their silver on my head,<br />
 And when the dimming eyes of age<br />
 With difficulty scan the page,<br />
 Perhaps <em>I&#8217;ll</em> turn the tables then;<br />
 Perhaps <em>I&#8217;ll</em> put the question, when<br />
 I borrow of your better sight&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Please&mdash;will you read to me to-night?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;TREASURE ISLAND&rdquo;</strong></p>


<p>
 Comes little lady, a book in hand,<br />
 A light in her eyes that I understand,<br />
 And her cheeks aglow from the faery breeze<br />
 That sweeps across the uncharted seas.<br />
 She gives me the book, and her word of praise<br />
 A ton of critical thought outweighs.<br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;I&#8217;ve finished it, daddie!&rdquo;&mdash;a sigh thereat.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Are there any more books in the world like that?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>
 No, little lady. I grieve to say<br />
 That of all the books in the world to-day<br />
 There&#8217;s not another that&#8217;s quite the same<br />
 As this magic book with the magic name.<br />
 Volumes there be that are pure delight,<br />
 Ancient and yellowed or new and bright;<br />
 But&mdash;little and thin, or big and fat&mdash;<br />
 There are no more books in the world like that.</p>

<p>
 And what, little lady, would I not give<br />
 For the wonderful world in which you live!<br />
 What have I garnered one-half as true<br />
 As the tales Titania whispers you?<br />
 Ah, late we learn that the only truth<br />
 Was that which we found in the Book of Youth.<br />
 Profitless others, and stale, and flat;&mdash;<br />
 There are no more books in the world like that.</p>

 Up in the woodland where Spring<br />

 Whispers the pines that the King,<br />
 Fallen, has yielded the keys<br />
 To his White Palace and flees<br />

 Northward my fancy takes wing,<br />
 Restless am I, ill at ease.<br />
 Pleasures the city can bring<br />
 Lose now their power to please.<br />
 Barren, all barren, are these,<br />
 Town life&#8217;s a tedious tale;<br />
 That cup is drained to the lees&mdash;<br />
 Ho, for the pack and the trail!</p>

<p>
 Ho, for the morning I sling<br />
 Pack at my back, and with knees<br />
 Brushing a thoroughfare, fling<br />

 One with the birds and the bees,<br />
 One with the squirrel and quail,<br />

 Why, when the sun is gold,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The weather fine,</span><br />
 The air (this phrase is old)<br />

 Why, when the leaves are red,<br />

 And when (as has been said)<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The skies are blue;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>
 Why, when all things promote<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">One&#8217;s peace and joy,&mdash;</span><br />
 A joy that is (to quote)<br />

<p><strong>THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE</strong></p>

<p>
 Twas in a vault beneath the street,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the trench of the traction rope,</span><br />
 That I found a guy with a fishy eye<br />

<p>
 His hair was matted, his face was black,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And matted and black was he;</span><br />
 And I heard this wight in the vault recite,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: .7em;">&ldquo;In a singular minor key&rdquo;:</span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: .3em;">&ldquo;Oh, I am the guy with the fishy eye</span><br />

<p><strong>A BALLADE OF DEATH AND TIME</strong></p>


<p>
 I hold it truth with him who sweetly sings&mdash;<br />
 The weekly music of the <em>London Sphere</em>&mdash;<br />
 That deathless tomes the living present brings:<br />
 Great literature is with us year on year.<br />
 Books of the mighty dead, whom men revere,<br />
 Remind me I can make <em>my</em> books sublime.<br />
 But prithee, bay my brow while I am here:<br />
 Why do we always wait for Death and Time?</p>

<p>
 Shakespeare, great spirit, beat his mighty wings,<br />
 As I beat mine, for the occasion near.<br />
 He knew, as I, the worth of present things:<br />
 Great literature is with us year on year.<br />
 Methinks I meet across the gulf his clear<br />
 And tranquil eye; his calm reflections chime<br />
 With mine: &ldquo;Why do we at the present fleer?<br />
 Why do we always wait for Death and Time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
 The reading world with acclamation rings<br />
 For my last book. It led the list at Weir,<br />
 Altoona, Rahway, Painted Post, Hot Springs:<br />
 Great literature is with us year on year.<br />
 The <em>Bookman</em> gives me a vociferous cheer.<br />
 Howells approves! I can no higher climb.<br /><br />
 Bring then the laurel, crown my bright career.<br />
 Why do we always wait for Death and Time?</p>

<p><strong>THE KAISER&#8217;S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY</strong></p>


<p>
 Aufwiedersehen, brother mine!<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Farewells will soon be kissed;</span><br />
 And ere you leave to breast the brine<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Give me once more your fist;</span></p>

<p>
 That mail&eacute;d fist, clenched high in air<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">On many a foreign shore,</span><br />
 Enforcing coaling stations where<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">No stations were before;</span></p>

<p>
 That fist, which weaker nations view<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if &#8217;twere Michael&#8217;s own,</span><br />
 And which appals the heathen who<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bow down to wood and stone.</span></p>

<p>
 But this trip no brass knuckles. Glove<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That heavy mail&eacute;d hand;</span><br />
 Your mission now is one of Love<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Peace&mdash;you understand.</span></p>

<p>
 All that&#8217;s American you&#8217;ll praise;<br />

 To use his own expressive phrase,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just &ldquo;jolly him along.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>
 Express surprise to find, the more<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Roosevelt you see,</span><br />
 How much I am like Theodore,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Theodore like me.</span></p>

 The Theodore of the East, and he<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The William of the West.</span></p>

<p>
 And, should you get a chance, find out&mdash;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">If anybody knows&mdash;</span><br />
 Exactly what it&#8217;s all about,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Doctrine of Monroe&#8217;s.</span></p>

 Be just as Yankee as you can;<br />

 Cut out the &#8217;kraut, cut out Rhine wine,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cut out the Sch&uuml;tzenfest,</span><br />
 The S&auml;ngerbund, the Turnverein,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Kommers, and the rest.</span></p>

 And if some fool society<br />

<em>You</em> sing &ldquo;My Country, &#8217;Tis of Thee&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tune&#8217;s &ldquo;God Save the King.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>
 To our own kindred in that land<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">There&#8217;s not much you need tell.</span><br />
 Just tell them that you saw me, and<br />

<p><strong>TO LILLIAN RUSSELL</strong></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 3em;">(<em>A reminiscence of 18&mdash;.</em>)</span></p>


<p>

 Back when&mdash;? (But we&#8217;ll not count the years;<br />

<p>
 On that (to me) momentous day<br />
 You dwelt amid the city&#8217;s clatter,<br />
 A few doors west of old Broadway;<br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">The street&mdash;no matter.</span></p>

<p>
 But while you have forgot the debt,<br />
 And him who called in line of duty,<br />
 He never, never shall forget<br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Your wondrous beauty.</span></p>

<p>
 You were too fair for mortal speech,&mdash;<br />
 Enchanting, positively rippin&#8217;;<br />
 You were some dream, and quelque peach,<br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And beaucoup pippin.</span></p>

 Your &ldquo;fight with Time&rdquo; had not begun,<br />
 Nor any reason to promote it;<br />
 No beauty battles to be won.<br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Beauty? You wrote it!</span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;A bill?&rdquo; you murmured in distress,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;A bill?&rdquo; (I still can hear you say it.)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;A bill from Mr. Fiske? Oh, yes ...</span><br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">I&#8217;ll call and pay it.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>
 And he, the thrice-requited kid,<br />
 That such a goddess should address him,<br />
 Could only blush and paw his lid,<br />

 Eheu! It seems a cycle since,<br />
 But still the nerve of memory tingles.<br />
 And here you&#8217;re writing Beauty Hints,<br />

<p><strong>REFORM IN OUR TOWN</strong></p>


<p>
 There was a man in Our Town<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Jimson was his name,</span><br />
 Who cried, &ldquo;Our civic government<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is honeycombed with shame.&rdquo;</span><br />
 He called us neighbors in and said,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: .7em;">&ldquo;By Graft we&#8217;re overrun.</span><br />
 Let&#8217;s have a general cleaning up,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As other towns have done.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>
 The citizens of Our Town<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Responded to the call;</span><br />
 Beneath the banner of Reform<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">We gathered one and all.</span><br />
 We sent away for men expert<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In hunting civic sin,</span><br />
 To ask these practised gentlemen<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just how we should begin.</span></p>

<p>
 The experts came to Our Town<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And told us how &#8217;twas done.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Begin with Gas and Traction,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And half your fight is won.</span><br />
 Begin with Gas and Traction;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rest will follow soon.&rdquo;</span><br />
 We looked at one another<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hummed a different tune.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
 Said Smith, &ldquo;Saloons in Our Town<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are palaces of shame.&rdquo;</span><br />
 Said Jones, &ldquo;Police corruption<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has hurt the town&#8217;s fair name.&rdquo;</span><br />
 Said Brown, &ldquo;Our lawless children<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pitch pennies as they please.&rdquo;</span><br />
 Now would it not be wiser<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To start Reform with these?</span></p>

<p>
 The men who came to Our Town<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Replied, &ldquo;No haste with these;</span><br />
 Begin with Gas&mdash;or Water&mdash;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The roots of the disease.&rdquo;</span><br />
 We looked at one another<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hemmed and hawed a bit;</span><br />
 Enthusiasm faded then<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">From every single cit.</span></p>

<p>
 The men who came to Our Town<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Expressed a mild surprise,</span><br />
 Then they too at each other<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Looked &ldquo;with a wild surmise.&rdquo;</span><br />
 Jimson had stock in Traction,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Jones had stock in Gas,</span><br />
 And Smith and Brown in this and that,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">So&mdash;nothing came to pass.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
 The profligates of Our Town<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pitch pennies as of yore;</span><br />
 Police corruption flourishes<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As rankly as before,</span><br />
 Still are our gilded ginmills<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Foul palaces of shame.</span><br />
 Reform is just as distant<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As when the wise men came.</span></p>

<p><strong>BREAD PUDDYNGE</strong></p>


<p>
 When good King Arthur ruled our land<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">He was a goodly king,</span><br />
 And his idea of what to eat<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was a good bag puddynge.</span></p>

<p>
 The bag puddynge he had in mind<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was thickly strewn with plums,</span><br />
 With alternating lumps of fat<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As big as my two thumbs.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;My love,&rdquo; quoth he to Guinevere,</span><br />

 Sir Launce is here, Sir Tris, Sir Gal,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the brave array.</span></p>

<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Put everything across to-night</span><br />

<p>
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;I&#8217;ll curl your hair,&rdquo; said Guinevere,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: .7em;">&ldquo;As tight as tight can be;</span><br />

<p>
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Pitch in and eat, my merry men!&rdquo;</span><br />

   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon that bag puddynge.</span></p>

<p>
 One taste, and every holy knight<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sat speechless for a space,</span><br />
 While disappointment and disgust<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were writ in every face.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Odsbodikins!&rdquo; Sir Tristram cried,</span><br />

 King Arthur spat his mouthful out,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sent for Guinevere.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;What is this frightful mess?&rdquo; he roared.</span><br />

 Baby bye, here&#8217;s a fly,<br />
 We will watch him, you and I;<br />
 Lest he fall in Baby&#8217;s mouth,<br />
 Bringing germs from north and south.<br />
 In the world of things a-wing<br />
 There is not a nastier thing<br />
 Than this pesky little fly;&mdash;<br />
 So we&#8217;ll watch him, you and I.</p>

<p>
 See him crawl up the wall,<br />
 And he&#8217;ll never, never fall;<br />
 Save that, poisoned, he may drop<br />
 In the soup or on the chop.<br />
 Let us coax the cunning brute<br />
 To the tempting Tanglefoot,<br />
 Or invite his thirsty soul<br />
 To the poison-paper bowl.</p>

<p>
 I believe with six such legs<br />
 You or I could walk on eggs;<br />
 But he&#8217;d rather crawl on meat<br />
 With his microbe-laden feet.<br />
 Eggs would hardly do as well&mdash;<br />
 He could not get through the shell;<br />
 Better far, to spread disease,<br />
 Vegetables, meat, or cheese.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
 There he goes, on his toes,<br />
 Tickling, tickling Baby&#8217;s nose.<br />
 Heaven knows where he has been,<br />
 And what filth he&#8217;s wallowed in.<br />
 Drat the nasty little wretch!<br />
 He&#8217;s the deuce and all to ketch.<br />
 Ah! He&#8217;s settled on the wall.<br />
 Now the thunderbolt shall fall!</p>

<p>
 Baby bye, see that fly?<br />
 We will swat him, you and I.</p>

 Now is my season of unrest,<br />
 Now calls the forest, day and night;<br />
 And by its pleasant spell obsessed,<br />
 My wits go soaring like a kite.<br />
 Forgive me if I be not bright,<br />

 Wood-fancies put my wits to flight;&mdash;<br />
 The woods are but a week away.</p>

 Falleth upon my pen a blight.<br />
 The daily task has lost its zest,<br />
 And everything is flat and trite.<br />
 There&#8217;s nothing humorous in sight;<br />
 Don&#8217;t mind if I am dull to-day.<br />
 For every column is a fight<br />
 When woods are but a week away.</p>

<p>
 Woods in the robes of summer dressed&mdash;<br />
 In greens and grays and browns bedight!<br />
 A journey on a river&#8217;s breast,<br />
 Beneath the wedded blue-and-white!...<br />
 This end the Voyage of Delight<br />

 A bark canoe, all trim and tight;&mdash;<br />

<p><strong>WHEN IT IS HOT</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>And Nebuchadnezzar commanded the most mighty men
that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</em>&rdquo;</p>


<p>
 Consider Mr. Shadrach,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of fiery furnace fame:</span><br />
 He didn&#8217;t bleat about the heat<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or fuss about the flame.</span><br />
 He didn&#8217;t stew and worry,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And get his nerves in kinks,</span><br />
 Nor fill his skin with limes and gin<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And other &ldquo;cooling drinks.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>
 Consider Mr. Meshach,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who felt the furnace too:</span><br />
 He let it sizz nor queried &ldquo;Is<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">It hot enough for you?&rdquo;</span><br />
 He didn&#8217;t mop his forehead,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hunt a shady spot;</span><br />
 Nor did he say, &ldquo;Gee! what a day!<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Believe me, it&#8217;s some hot.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>
 Consider, too, Abed-nego,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who shared his comrades&#8217; plight:</span><br />
 He didn&#8217;t shake his coat and make<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Himself a holy sight.</span><br />
 He didn&#8217;t wear suspenders<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without a coat and vest;</span><br />
 Nor did he scowl and snort and howl,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And make himself a pest.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
 Consider, friends, this trio&mdash;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">How little fuss they made.</span><br />
 They didn&#8217;t curse when it was worse<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than ninety in the shade.</span><br />
 They moved about serenely<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the furnace bright,</span><br />
 And soon forgot that it was hot,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With &ldquo;no relief in sight.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>A NOTE FROM MR. FLACCUS</strong></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 3em;">(<em>Concerning the verses that follow.</em>)</span></p>


<p>Dear B. L. T.:</p>

<p>You know my &ldquo;pomes.&rdquo; Well, old man, I
was pretty young when I got them out of my system,
and they seem rather raw to me now&mdash;I&#8217;m
getting along, you know; so I&#8217;ve been thinking
that I&#8217;d do &#8217;em over again, file &#8217;em down, as we
used to say. Enclosed is the result of my labors.</p>

<p>I presume you are wondering why I have
done them into United States; but you know perfectly
well that a poet as much alive as I am to-day

 Has caused my Emperor so much pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS</strong></p>


<p>
 We sprang to the motor, I, Joris and Dirck.<br />
 I snapped on my goggles and got to my work.<br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Hi, there!&rdquo; yelled the cop in the helmet of white;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Let her flicker!&rdquo; said Joris, and into the night,</span><br />
 With a sneer at the speed laws, we hurtled hell-bent<br />
 To carry to Aix the good tidings from Ghent.</p>

<p>
 The going was poor, we expected delay,<br />
 And the usual livestock obstructed the way.<br />
 At Boom we ran over a large yellow dog,<br />
 At D&uuml;ffeld a chicken, at Mecheln a hog;<br />
 What else, we&#8217;d no time to slow down to inquire;<br />
 At Aerschot, confound it! we blew out a tire.</p>

<p>
 I jacked up the axle and ripped off the shoe,<br />
 And snapped on an extra that promised to do.<br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; I exclaimed as I cranked the machine,</span><br />
 But something was wrong with the curst gasoline.<br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;By Hasselt!&rdquo; Dirck groaned, &ldquo;We&#8217;ll be half a day late;</span><br />
 We ought to have sent the good tidings by freight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
 False prophet! I tinkered a minute or two<br />
 And again we were off like &ldquo;a bolt from the blue.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span><br />
 We ate up the hills at a forty-mile clip,<br />
 And skidded the turns like the snap of a whip,<br />
 Till we dashed into Aix and were pinched by a cop<br />
 For failing to slow when commanded to stop.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Now, wouldn&#8217;t that frost you!&rdquo; said Joris, but we</span><br />
 When we told the glad tidings were instantly free.<br />
 The Mayor himself paid the ten dollars&#8217; fine,<br />
 And blew us to dinner with six kinds of wine,<br />
 Which (the burgesses voted, by common consent)<br />
 Was no more than their due that brought good news from Ghent.</p>

<p><strong>THE DINOSAUR</strong></p>


<p>
 Behold the mighty Dinosaur,<br />
 Famous in prehistoric lore,<br />
 Not only for his weight and strength<br />
 But for his intellectual length.<br />
 You will observe by these remains<br />
 The creature had two sets of brains&mdash;<br />
 One in his head (the usual place),<br />
 The other at his spinal base.<br />
 Thus he could reason <em>a priori</em><br />
 As well as <em>a posteriori</em>.<br />
 No problem bothered him a bit;<br />
 He made both head and tail of it.<br />
 So wise he was, so wise and solemn,<br />
 Each thought filled just a spinal column.<br />
 If one brain found the pressure strong<br />
 It passed a few ideas along;<br />
 If something slipped his forward mind<br />
 &#8217;Twas rescued by the one behind;<br />
 And if in error he was caught<br />
 He had a saving afterthought.<br />
 As he thought twice before he spoke<br />
 He had no judgments to revoke;<br />
 For he could think, without congestion,<br />
 Upon both sides of every question.</p>

<p>
 Oh, gaze upon this model beast,<br />
 Defunct ten million years at least.</p>

 When as a dewdrop joy enspheres<br />
 This pleasant planet, arched with blue,<br />

 And all the world is fair to view&mdash;<br />

 Who then would envy (if he knew)<br />
 Jack Point the jester, glum and trist;<br />
 Or ply, tho&#8217; first of all the crew,<br />
 The dismal trade of humorist?</p>

<p>
 Ah, jocund trifles writ in tears,<br />
 And merry stanzas steeped in rue!<br />
 When all the world in drab appears<br />
 The fool must still in motley woo.<br />
 Tho&#8217; bitter be the cud he chew,<br />
 Still must he grind his foolish grist;<br />
 Still must he ply, the long day through,<br />

<p><strong>GENTLE DOCTOR BROWN</strong></p>


<p>
 It was a gentle sawbones and his name was Doctor Brown.<br />
 His auto was the terror of a small suburban town.<br />
 His practice, quite amazing for so trivial a place,<br />
 Consisted of the victims of his homicidal pace.</p>

<p>
 So constant was his practice and so high his motor&#8217;s gear<br />
 That at knocking down pedestrians he never had a peer;<br />
 But it must, in simple justice, be as truly written down<br />
 That no man could be more thoughtful than gentle Doctor Brown.</p>

<p>
 Whatever was the errand on which Doctor Brown was bent<br />
 He&#8217;d stop to patch a victim up and never charged a cent.<br />
 He&#8217;d always pause, whoever &#8217;twas he happened to run down:<br />
 A humane and a thoughtful man was gentle Doctor Brown.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;How fortunate,&rdquo; he would observe, &ldquo;how fortunate &#8217;twas I</span><br />
 That knocked you galley-west and heard your wild and wailing cry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span><br />
 There <em>are</em> some heartless wretches who would leave you here alone,<br />
 Without a sympathetic ear to catch your dying moan.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Such callousness,&rdquo; said Doctor Brown, &ldquo;I cannot comprehend;</span><br />
 To fathom such indifference I simply don&#8217;t pretend.<br />
 One ought to do his duty, and I never am remiss.<br />
 A simple word of thanks is all I ask. Here, swallow this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>
 Then, reaching in the tonneau, he&#8217;d unpack his little kit,<br />
 And perform an operation that was workmanlike and fit.<br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;You may survive,&rdquo; said Doctor Brown; &ldquo;it&#8217;s happened once or twice.</span><br />
 If not, you&#8217;ve had the benefit of competent advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
 Oh, if all our motormaniacs were equally humane,<br />
 How little bitterness there&#8217;d be, or reason to complain!<br />
 How different our point of view if we were ridden down<br />
 By lunatics as thoughtful as gentle Doctor Brown!</p>

<p>
<em>This is something that I heard,</em><br />
<em>As the fluting of a bird,</em><br />
<em>On a certain drowsy day,</em><br />
<em>When my pipe was under way.</em><br />
<em>I was weary of the town,</em><br />
<em>And the going up and down;</em><br />
<em>Sick of streets and sick of noise,&mdash;</em><br />
<em>And I pined for Pagan joys.</em></p>

<p>
 Daphne, here it is July!<br />
 Just the month, my love, to fly<br />
 To a sylvan solitude<br />
 In the green and ancient wood.<br />
 We will trip it as we go<br />
 On the neo-Pagan toe,<br />
 Sunny days and starry nights,<br />
 Savoring the wild delights<br />
 Of a turbulent desire<br />
 That may set the wood on fire.</p>

<p>
 We will play at hunt-the-fawn,<br />
 In the neo-Dorian dawn.<br />
 You will scamper through the brake,<br />
 And I&#8217;ll follow in your wake&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
 As the young Apollo ran<br />
 In the piping days of Pan.<br />
 You&#8217;ll escape me, without doubt,<br />
 For I&#8217;m just a trifle stout;<br />
 But, when I have lagged behind,<br />
 Waiting for my second wynde,<br />
 From some pretty hiding-place<br />
 Will emerge your laughing face;<br />
 I shall glimpse your eyes of blue,<br />
 Hear your merry &ldquo;Peek-a-boo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>
 What to wear? The Pagan plan<br />
 Contemplates a coat of tan;<br />
 But I fear we shall require<br />
 Just a trifle more attire.<br />
 Bushes scratch and brambles sting;<br />
 Insect myriads are a-wing;&mdash;<br />
 Heavens, how mosquitoes swarm<br />
 When the woodland air is warm.<br />
 (<span class="smcap">Mem</span>: To take, when we elope,<br />
 Tanglewood Mosquito Dope.)</p>

<p>
 Do you like the picture, dear?<br />
 Have you aught of doubt or fear?<br />
 Have you any criticism<br />
 Of my neo-Paganism?<br />
 If not, dearie, let us fly<br />
 To that passion-ripening sky,<br />
 Where our souls may have their fling,<br />
 And our every care take wing.</p>

<em>For arose the wraith of Doubt;</em><br />

<p>
 Daphne, come and live with me<br />
 In a Pagan greenery.<br />
 Life will then be naught but play,<br />
 One long Pagan holiday.<br />
 We will play at hide and seek<br />
 In the alders by the creek;<br />
 Sport amid the cascade&#8217;s smother.<br />
 Splashing water at each other;&mdash;<br />
 Every moment pleasure wooing,<br />
 Every moment something doing.<br />
 If we talk, we&#8217;ll talk of Love:<br />
 All its arguments we&#8217;ll prove.<br />
 Such a mental rest you&#8217;ll find.<br />
 Leave your intellect behind.</p>

<p>
 Night will come, (for come it will,<br />
 &#8217;Spite the fluting on the hill,)<br />
 And we&#8217;ll pitch a cozy camp<br />
 Where it isn&#8217;t quite so damp.<br />
 While you dry your hair and laze<br />
 By the campfire&#8217;s violet blaze,<br />
 I will rob a balsam tree<br />
 To construct a house for thee.<br />
 What so dear as to be wooed<br />
 In a sylvan solitude?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
 What so sweet as Pagan vows<br />
 Whispered in a house of boughs?<br />
 Pagan love&#8217;s without alloy.<br />
 Pagan kisses never cloy.<br />
 Arms that cling in Pagan fashion<br />
 Never tire. A Pagan passion<br />
 Is the only kind I know<br />
 That outlives a winter&#8217;s snow.<br />
 Daphne, Daphne, let us fly!<br />
 You&#8217;re a Pagan&mdash;so am I.</p>

<p>
<em>So the fluting on the hill</em><br />
<em>Passed and died, and all was still.</em><br />
<em>So the Pagan Pickings died,</em><br />
<em>And I laid the pipe aside.</em></p>

<p><strong>A BALLADE OF A BORE</strong></p>


<p>
 When the weather is warm and the glass running high<br />
 And the odors of Araby tincture the air;<br />
 When the sun is aloft in a white and blue sky,<br />
 And the morrow holds promise of falling as fair;&mdash;<br />
 In spring or in summer I&#8217;m free to declare,<br />
 And the same I am equally free to maintain,<br />
 One person has power my peace to impair:<br />
 The man who tells limericks gives me a pain.</p>

<p>
 When the foliage flushes and summer is by,<br />
 And russet and red are the popular wear;<br />
 When the song of the woodland is changed to a sigh<br />
 And the horn of the hunter is heard by the hare;&mdash;<br />
 In the season of autumn I&#8217;m free to declare,<br />
 And my language is lucid and simple and plain,<br />
 One person&#8217;s acquaintance I freely forswear:<br />
 The man with the limerick gives me a pain.</p>

<p>
 When the landscape is iced and the snow feathers fly,<br />
 When the fields are all bald and the trees are all bare,<br />
 And the prospect which nature presents to the eye<br />
 Is chiefly distinguished by glitter and glare;&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
 In the season of winter I&#8217;m free to declare<br />
 That the limerick person is flat and inane.<br />
 This person, I think, we could easily spare:<br />
 The man who tells limericks gives me a pain.</p>

 Said he: &ldquo;I hate the very name;<br />

 I wouldn&#8217;t change them if I could;<br />
 I&#8217;d rather have things queer than good.&rdquo;</p>

 But everything was stale and flat.<br />
 Said I, &ldquo;You once adored the chaste,<br />

 The Ancient Wood is white and still,<br />
 Over the pines the bleak wind blows,<br />
 Voiceless the brook and mute the rill,<br />

 Weaving, wreathing rings disclose<br />
 A trail that flings straight up the hill,<br />
 Straight as an arrow&#8217;s flight. For those<br />
 Who fare by night the pole star glows<br />
 Above the mountain top. By day<br />
 A blasted pine the pathway shows<br />
 Over the hills and far away.</p>

 The Ancient Wood is white and chill,<br />
 But what know I of wintry woes?<br />
 The Pipesmoke Trail is mine at will&mdash;<br />
 Naught may hinder and none oppose.<br />

 When the wilderness calls I may<br />
 Tramping go, as I smoke and doze,<br />
 Over the hills and far away.</p>

 Of all common commonplaces;&mdash;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">So I merely would remark</span><br />
         <span style="margin-left: 3em;">That&mdash;it&#8217;s true.</span></p>

<p><strong>THE BARDS WE QUOTE</strong></p>


<p>
 Whene&#8217;er I quote I seldom take<br />
 From bards whom angel hosts environ;<br />
 But usually some damned rake<br />
            <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Like Byron.</span></p>

<p>
 Of Whittier I think a lot,<br />
 My fancy to him often turns;<br />
 But when I quote &#8217;tis some such sot<br />
            <span style="margin-left: 4em;">As Burns.</span></p>

<p>
 I&#8217;m very fond of Bryant, too,<br />
 He brings to me the woodland smelly;<br />
 Why should I quote that &ldquo;village roo,&rdquo;<br />
            <span style="margin-left: 4em;">P. Shelley?</span></p>

<p>
 I think Felicia Hemans great,<br />
 I dote upon Jean Ingelow;<br />
 Yet quote from such a reprobate<br />
            <span style="margin-left: 4em;">As Poe.</span></p>

<p>
 To quote from drunkard or from rake<br />
 Is not a proper thing to do.<br />
 I find the habit hard to break,<br />
            <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Don&#8217;t you?</span></p>

   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Something special? Not a bit.</span><br />

<p><strong>HENCE THESE RIMES</strong></p>


<p>
 Tho&#8217; my verse is exact,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tho&#8217; it flawlessly flows,</span><br />
 As a matter of fact<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">I would rather write prose.</span></p>

<p>
 While my harp is in tune,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I sing like the birds,</span><br />
 I would really as soon<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Write in straightaway words.</span></p>

<p>
 Tho&#8217; my songs are as sweet<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As Apollo e&#8217;er piped,</span><br />
 And my lines are as neat<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As have ever been typed,</span></p>

<p>
 I would rather write prose&mdash;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">I prefer it to rime;</span><br />
 It&#8217;s less hard to compose,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it takes me less time.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Well, if that be the case,&rdquo;</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">You are moved to inquire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Why appropriate space</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For extolling your lyre?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>
 I can only reply<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That this form I elect</span><br />
 &#8217;Cause it pleases the eye,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I like the effect.</span></p>

<p><strong>THE OLD ROLLER TOWEL</strong></p>


<p>
 How dear to this heart is the old roller towel<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which fond recollection presents to my view.</span><br />
 It hung like a pall on the wall of the washroom,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gathered the grime of the linotype crew.</span><br />
 The sink and the soap and the lye that stood by it<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remain; but the towel is gone past recall.</span><br />
 O tempora! Also, O mores! Sic transit<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The time-honored towel that creaked on the wall.</span><br />
 The grimy old towel, the slimy old towel,<br />
 The tacky old towel that hung on the wall.</p>

<p>
 Now hangs in the washroom a huge roll of paper&mdash;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The old printer&#8217;s towel we&#8217;ll never see more.</span><br />
 The new (see directions) is &ldquo;used like a blotter,&rdquo;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And crumpled and scattered in wads on the floor.</span><br />
 And often, when drying my hands in this fashion,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tears of remembrance will gather and fall,</span><br />
 And I sigh (though I&#8217;m not what you&#8217;d call sentimental)<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the classic old towel that propped up the wall.</span><br />
 The sainted old towel, the tainted old towel,<br />
 The gooey old towel that hung on the wall.</p>

<p><strong>UP CULTURE&#8217;S HILL</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 3em;">(<em>The confession of a club lady.</em>)</p>


<p>
 The path up Culture&#8217;s Hill is steep,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And weary is the way,</span><br />
 With very little time for sleep<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And none at all for play.</span></p>

<p>
 She that this toilsome task essays<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Must never bat an eye,</span><br />
 But keep her firm, unwavering gaze<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forever fixed on high.</span></p>

<p>
 For should she ever careless grow,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And let her glances stray</span><br />
 Down to the shallow vale below,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where Pleasure&#8217;s Court holds sway&mdash;</span></p>

<p>
 Lured by the thrice forbidden fruit,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">She&#8217;d lose her equipoise,</span><br />
 And like a wayward Pleiad shoot<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down to forbidden joys.</span></p>

<p>
 I&#8217;ve been but short time on the road,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">My courage still is strong;</span><br />
 Yet often have I felt the goad<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That hurries me along.</span></p>

<p>
 I&#8217;ve fallen over Maeterlinck,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bumped myself to tears,</span><br />
 Burne-Jones&#8217;s pictures made me blink,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Wagner hurts my ears.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
 I&#8217;ve stumbled over Ibsen humps<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And over Rembrandt rocks,</span><br />
 I&#8217;ve got some fierce Debussy bumps,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some awful Nietsche knocks.</span></p>

<p>
 I&#8217;m wearied by the ceaseless quest,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">I&#8217;m wayworn and footsore.</span><br />
 I&#8217;ve Culture till I cannot rest&mdash;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet still I climb for more.</span></p>

<p>
 But oh, when all is done and said,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon some manly breast</span><br />
 I&#8217;d like to lay my tired head<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And take a good long rest.</span></p>

<p><strong>THE PASSIONAL NOTE</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The erotic motive is almost entirely absent from American
poetry. Even our younger American poets are more
profoundly interested in the why and wherefore of things
than in the girdle of Helen or the gleaming limbs of &lsquo;the
white implacable Aphrodite.&rsquo;</em>&rdquo;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;" class="smcap">&mdash;Mr. Sylvester Viereck.</span></p>


<p>
 In the years of my season erotic,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Eros was lord of my days,</span><br />
 And I loved, with a love idiotic,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Mabels and Madges and Mays;</span><br />
 When a purple and passionate lyric<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would sing all the night in my head,&mdash;</span><br />
 I yearned, like the young Mr. Viereck,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For everything red.</span></p>

<p>
 I doted on poems of passion,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And put my own pantings in rime,</span><br />
 To celebrate, after a fashion,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The damsels who took up my time.</span><br />
 I fed upon Swinburne, believe me,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">I feasted on Byron and Burns,</span><br />
 And couplets from Sappho would give me<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Most exquisite turns.</span></p>

<p>
 How apparent it was that our songbirds&mdash;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our Emerson, Lowell, and Payne,</span><br />
 And Bryant and Drake&mdash;were the wrong birds<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To pipe to the passional strain.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
 There was, in a word, nothing doing<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In all of the rimes that they wrote;</span><br />
 They seemed to be always pursuing<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ethical note.</span></p>

<p>
 What truth, I inquired, was so mighty,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">What ethical thing was so rare,</span><br />
 As the limbs of the white Aphrodite<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or a strand of her heaven-kissed hair!</span><br />
 The girdle of red-headed Helen<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Outweighed all the wherefores and whys,</span><br />
 And Wisdom elected to dwell in<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A pair of blue eyes.</span></p>

<p>
<em>Now</em> lyrical sizzlers and scorchers<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fail somehow to set me ablaze;</span><br />
 No longer are exquisite tortures<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Provoked by these passionate lays.</span><br />
 I&#8217;ve tinned&mdash;and I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve missed &#8217;em&mdash;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The poems of passion and sin.</span><br />
<em>Some</em> things one gets out of one&#8217;s system,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And other things <em>in</em>.</span></p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
