THE NEW YORK IDEA






Langdon Mitchell





LANGDON MITCHELL

(Born Philadelphia, Pa., February 17, 1862)


The performance of "The New York Idea" at the Lyric
Theatre, New York, on November 19, 1906, was one of the rare,
distinguished events in the American Theatre. It revealed the
fact that at last an American playwright had written a drama
comparable with the very best European models, scintillating
with clear, cold brilliancy, whose dialogue carried with it an
exceptional literary style. It was a play that showed a vitality
which will serve to keep it alive for many generations, which will
make it welcome, however often it is revived; for there is a universal
import to its satire which raises it above the local, social
condition it purports to portray. And though there is nothing
of an ideal character about its situations, though it seems to be
all head, with a minimum of apparent heart, it none the less is
universal in the sense that Restoration comedy is universal. It
presents a type of vulgarity, of sporting spirit, that is common in
every generation, whether in the time of Congreve and Wycherley,
whether in the period of Sheridan or Oscar Wilde. Its wit is
not dependent on local colour, though ostensibly it is written
about New York. On its first presentment, it challenged good
writing on the part of the critics. High Comedy always does
that&mdash;tickles the brain and stimulates it, drives it at a pace not
usually to be had in the theatre. Is it comedy or is it farce, the
critics queried? Is Mr. Mitchell sincere, and does he flay the evil
he so photographically portrays? Does he treat the sacred subject
of matrimony too flippantly? And should the play, in order
to be effective, have a moral tag, or should it be, what on the
surface it appears to be, a series of realistic scenes about people
whom one cannot admire and does not want to know intimately?
Some of the writers found the picture not to their liking&mdash;that is
the effect good satire sometimes has when it strikes home. Yet
when Grace George revived "The New York Idea" in a spirit so
different from Mrs. Fiske's, nine years after, on September 28,
[Pg 600]1915, at the Playhouse, New York, the Times was bound to make
the following confession: "A vast array of American authors
have turned out plays innumerable, but not one of them has
quite matched in sparkling gayety and wit this work of Langdon
Mitchell's. And the passing years have left its satire still
pointed. They have not dimmed its polish nor so much as
scratched its smart veneer."

The play was written expressly for Mrs. Fiske. Its hard,
sharp interplay of humour was knowingly cut to suit her hard,
sharp method of acting. Her interpretation was a triumph of
head over heart. Grace George tried to read into Cynthia
Karslake an element of romance which is suggested in the text,
but which was somewhat over-sentimentalized by her soft portrayal.
There is some element of relationship between "The New
York Idea" and Henry Arthur Jones' "Mary Goes First;" there
is the same free air of sporting life, so graphically set forth in
"Lord and Lady Algy." But the American play is greater than
these because of its impersonal strain.

In a letter to the present Editor, Mr. Mitchell has broken
silence regarding the writing of "The New York Idea." Never
before has he tried to analyze its evolution. He says:

The play was written for Mrs. Fiske. The choice of subject was
mine. I demanded complete freedom in the treatment, and my most
wise manager, Mr. Harrison Grey Fiske, accorded this. The play
was produced and played as written, with the exception of one or two
short scenes, which were not acceptable to Mrs. Fiske; that is, she
felt, or would have felt, somewhat strained or unnatural in these
scenes. Accordingly, I cut them out, or rather rewrote them. The
temperament of the race-horse has to be considered&mdash;much more,
that of the 'star'.

When I was writing the play, I had really no idea of satirizing
divorce or a law or anything specially temperamental or local. What
I wanted to satirize was a certain extreme frivolity in the American
spirit and in our American life&mdash;frivolity in the deep sense&mdash;not just
a girl's frivolity, but that profound, sterile, amazing frivolity which
one observes and meets in our churches, in political life, in literature,
in music; in short, in every department of American thought, feeling
and action. The old-fashioned, high-bred family in "The New York
Idea" are solemnly frivolous, and the fast, light-minded, highly intelligent
hero and heroine are frivolous in their own delightful way&mdash;frivolity,
of course, to be used for tragedy or comedy. Our frivolity
is, I feel, on the edge of the tragic. Indeed, I think it entirely tragic,
and there are lines, comedy lines, in "The New York Idea," that
[Pg 601]indicate this aspect of the thing.

Of course, there is more than merely satire or frivolity in the
play: there is the Englishman who appears to Americans to be
stupid on account of his manner, but who is frightfully intelligent;
and there are also the energy and life and vigor of the two men
characters. There is, too, throughout the play, the conscious humour
of these two characters, and of the third woman, Vida. The
clergyman is really more frivolous often and far less conscious of his
frivolity&mdash;enough, that I rather thought one of the strongest things
about the play was the consciousness of their own humour, of the
three important characters.

The characters were selected from that especial class, or set,
in our Society, whose ancestors and traditions go back to colonial
times. They are not merely society characters, for, of course, people
in society may lack all traditions. I mention this merely because
my selection of characters from such a set of people gives the play a
certain mellowness and a certain air which it otherwise would not
have. If Jack and Cynthia were both completely self-made, or the
son and daughter of powerful, self-made people, their tone could
not be the same.

The piece was played in England as a farce; and it was given
without the permission of the author or American manager. It was
given for a considerable number of performances in Berlin, after
the Great War began. In the German translation it was called
"Jonathan's Daughter."[A] Our relations with Germany at the time
were strained on account of 'certain happenings', but, notwithstanding,
the play was extraordinarily well received.

When "The New York Idea" was first published by the Walter
Baker Co., of Boston, it carried as an introduction a notice of
the play written by William Archer, and originally published in
the London Tribune of May 27, 1907. This critique follows the
present foreword, as its use in the early edition represents Mr.
Mitchell's choice.

The writing of "The New York Idea" was not Mr. Mitchell's
first dramatic work for Mrs. Fiske. At the New York Fifth
Avenue Theatre, on September 12, 1899, she appeared in
"Becky Sharp," his successful version of Thackeray's "Vanity
Fair," which held the stage for some time, and was later revived
with considerable renewal of its former interest. Two years after,
rival versions were presented in London, one by David Balsillie
(Theatre Royal, Croydon, June 24, 1901) and the other by
Robert Hichens and Cosmo Gordon Lennox (Prince of Wales's
Theatre, August 27, 1901)&mdash;the latter play used during the[Pg 602]
existence of the New Theatre (New York). Most of Mr.
Mitchell's attempts in play-writing have been in dramatization,
first of his father's "The Adventures of Fran&ccedil;ois," and later of
Thackeray's "Pendennis," Atlantic City, October 11, 1916. He
was born February 17, 1862, at Philadelphia, the son of Silas
Weir Mitchell, and received his education largely abroad. He
studied law at Harvard and Columbia, and was admitted to the
bar in 1882. He was married, in 1892, to Marion Lea, of London,
whose name was connected with the early introduction of Ibsen
to the English public; she was in the initial cast of "The New
York Idea," and to her the play is dedicated.



Mr. William Archer's Notice of
"The New York Idea."


... This play, too, I was unable to see, but I have read
it with extraordinary interest. It is a social satire so largely
conceived and so vigorously executed that it might take an
honourable place in any dramatic literature. We have nothing
quite like it on the latter-day English stage. In tone and treatment
it reminds one of Mr. Carton; but it is far broader in conception
and richer in detail than "Lord and Lady Algy" or "Lady
Huntworth's Experiment." In France, it might perhaps be
compared to "La Famille Benoiton" or "Le Monde ou l'on
s'ennuie," or better, perhaps, to a more recent, but now almost
forgotten satire of the 'nineties, "Paris Fin-de-Si&egrave;cle."

I find it very hard to classify "The New York Idea" under any
of the established rubrics. It is rather too extravagant to rank
as a comedy; it is much too serious in its purport, too searching
in its character-delineation and too thoughtful in its wit, to be
treated as a mere farce. Its title&mdash;not, perhaps, a very happy
one&mdash;is explained in this saying of one of the characters: "Marry
for whim and leave the rest to the divorce court&mdash;that's the New
York idea of marriage." And again: "The modern American
marriage is like a wire fence&mdash;the woman's the wire&mdash;the posts
are the husbands. One&mdash;two&mdash;three! And if you cast your eye
over the future, you can count them, post after post, up hill, down
dale, all the way to Dakota."

Like all the plays, from Sardou's "Divor&ccedil;ons" onward, which
deal with a too facile system of divorce, this one shows a discontented
woman, who has broken up her home for a caprice, suffering[Pg 603]
agonies of jealousy when her ex-husband proposes to make use
of the freedom she has given him, and returning to him at last
with the admission that their divorce was at least "premature."
In this central conception there is nothing particularly original.
It is the wealth of humourous invention displayed in the details
both of character and situation that renders the play remarkable.

It is interesting to note, by the way, a return on Mr. Mitchell's
part to that convenient assumption of the Restoration and eighteenth
century comedy writers that any one in holy orders could
solemnize a legal marriage at any time or place, without the
slightest formality of banns, witnesses, registration or anything
of the sort. One gathers that in New York the entrance to and
the exit from the holy estate of matrimony are equally prompt
and easy; or that, as one of the characters puts it, "the church is
a regular quick-marriage counter."

I presume there is some exaggeration in this, and that a marriage
cannot actually be celebrated at midnight, over a champagne-and-lobster
supper, by a clergyman who happened to drop
in. But there can be no doubt that whatever the social merits or
demerits of the system, facility of divorce and remarriage is an
immense boon to the dramatist. It places within his reach an
inexhaustible store of situations and complications which are
barred to the English playwright, to whom divorce always means
an ugly and painful scandal. The moralist may insist that this
ought always to be the case; and indeed that is the implication
which Mr. Mitchell, as a moralist, conveys to us.

He sacrifices the system of divorce for every trivial flaw of
temper which prevails in the society he depicts; but he no doubt
realizes that his doctrine as a satirist is hostile to his interest as a
dramatist. Restrict the facilities of divorce and you at once
restrict the possibilities of matrimonial comedy. Marriage becomes
no longer a comic, but a tragic institution.

In order to keep his theme entirely on the comic plane, Mr.
Mitchell has given no children to either of the two couples whom
he puts through such a fantastic quadrille. Law or no law, the
separation of its parents is always a tragedy to the child; which
is not to say, of course, that their remaining together may not in
some cases be the more tragic of the two alternatives. Be this as
it may, Mr. Mitchell has eluded the issue.

Nor has he thereby falsified his problem, for his characters
belong to that class of society in which, as Mr. Dooley points out,[Pg 604]
the multiplication of automobiles is preferred to that of progeny.
But he has not omitted to hint at the problem of the children,
and, as it were, confess his deliberate avoidance of it. He does
so in a touch of exquisite irony. John and Cynthia Karslake are
a couple devoted, not to automobiles, but to horses. Even their
common passion for racing cannot keep them together; but their
divorce is so "premature," and leaves John so restless and dissatisfied,
that he actually neglects the cares of the stable. His
favourite mare, Cynthia K, falls ill, and when his trainer brings
him the news he receives it with shocking callousness. Then the
trainer meets Cynthia and complains to her of her ex-husband's
indifference. "Ah, ma'am," he says, "when husband and wife
splits, it's the horses that suffers." I know not where to look for
a speech of profounder ironic implication. More superficial, but
still a good specimen of Mr. Mitchell's wit, is William Sudley's
remark as to John Karslake: "Oh, yes, he comes of a very
respectable family, though I remember his father served a term
in the Senate."

Altogether "The New York Idea" is, from the intellectual
point of view, the most remarkable piece of work I have encountered
in America. It is probably too true to the details of
American life to have much success in England; but the situation
at the end of the third act could not fail to bring down the house
even here. It would take too long to describe it in detail. Suffice
it to say that just at the point where Cynthia Karslake dismisses
her second bridegroom, to return to her first, the choir assembled
for the marriage ceremony, mistaking a signal, bursts forth with
irresistibly ludicrous effect into "The Voice That Breathed O'er
Eden."[B]

THE NEW YORK IDEA


ACT I.


Scene. Living-room in the house of Philip Phillimore. Five
P. M. of an afternoon of May. The general air and appearance of
the room is that of an old-fashioned, decorous, comfortable interior.
There are no electric lights and no electric bells. Two bell ropes
as in old-fashioned houses. The room is in dark tones inclining
to sombre and of old-fashioned elegance.

Seated in the room are Miss Heneage, Mrs. Phillimore and
Thomas. Miss Heneage is a solidly built, narrow-minded
woman in her sixties. She makes no effort to look younger than
she is, and is expensively but quietly dressed, with heavy elegance.
She commands her household and her family connection, and on
the strength of a large and steady income feels that her opinion has
its value. Mrs. Phillimore is a semi-professional invalid,
refined and unintelligent. Her movements are weak and fatigued.
Her voice is habitually plaintive and she is entirely a lady without
a trace of being a woman of fashion. Thomas is an easy-mannered,
but respectful family servant, un-English both in style
and appearance. He has no deportment worthy of being so called,
and takes an evident interest in the affairs of the family he serves.

Miss Heneage is seated at the tea-table, facing the footlights. Mrs.
Phillimore is seated at the table on the right. Thomas stands
near by. Tea things on table. Decanter of sherry in coaster.
Bread and butter on plate. Vase with flowers. Silver match-box.
Large old-fashioned tea urn. Guard for flame. "The Evening
Post" on tea-table. Miss Heneage and Mrs. Phillimore both
have cups of tea. Miss Heneage sits up very straight, and pours
tea for Grace, who enters from door. She is a pretty and fashionably
dressed girl of twenty. She speaks superciliously, coolly,
and not too fast. She sits on the sofa gracefully and without
lounging. She wears a gown suitable for spring visiting, hat,
parasol, and gloves.


Grace. [As she moves to the sofa.] I never in my life walked
so far and found so few people at home. [Pauses. Takes off[Pg 614]
gloves. Somewhat querulously.] The fact is the nineteenth of
May is ridiculously late to be in town.

Miss Heneage. Thomas, Mr. Phillimore's sherry?

Thomas. [Indicating the particular table.] The sherry, ma'am.

Miss Heneage. Mr. Phillimore's Post?

Thomas. [Pointing to "The Evening Post" on the tea-table.]
The Post, ma'am.

Miss Heneage. [Indicating cup.] Miss Phillimore.

Thomas takes cup of tea to Grace. Silence. They all sip tea.
Thomas goes back, fills sherry glass, remaining round and about
the tea-table. They all drink tea during their entire conversation.

Grace. The Dudleys were at home. They wished to know
when my brother Philip was to be married, and where and how?

Miss Heneage. If the Dudleys were persons of breeding,
they'd not intrude their curiosity upon you.

Grace. I like Lena Dudley.

Mrs. Phillimore. [Speaking slowly and gently.] Do I know
Miss Dudley?

Grace. She knows Philip. She expects an announcement of
the wedding.

Mrs. Phillimore. I trust you told her that my son, my sister
and myself are all of the opinion that those who have been divorced
should remarry with modesty and without parade.

Grace. I told the Dudleys Philip's wedding was here, to-morrow.

Miss Heneage. [To Mrs. Phillimore, picking up a sheet of
paper from the table.] I have spent the afternoon, Mary, in
arranging and listing the wedding gifts, and in writing out the
announcements of the wedding. I think I have attained a proper
form of announcement. [Taking the sheet of note-paper and giving
it to Thomas.] Of course the announcement Philip himself made
was quite out of the question. [Grace smiles.] However, there is
mine. [She points to the paper. Thomas gives the list to Mrs.
Phillimore and moves away.

Grace. I hope you'll send an announcement to the Dudleys.

Mrs. Phillimore. [Prepared to make the best of things, plaintively
reads.] "Mr. Philip Phillimore and Mrs. Cynthia Dean
Karslake announce their marriage, May twentieth, at three[Pg 615]
o'clock, Nineteen A, Washington Square, New York." [Replacing
the paper on Thomas's salver.] It sounds very nice.


[Thomas returns the paper to Miss Heneage.


Miss Heneage. In my opinion it barely escapes sounding
nasty. However, it is correct. The only remaining question is&mdash;to
whom the announcement should not be sent. [Thomas goes
out.] I consider an announcement of the wedding of two divorced
persons to be in the nature of an intimate communication. It
not only announces the wedding&mdash;it also announces the divorce.
[Returning to her teacup.] The person I shall ask counsel of is
cousin William Sudley. He promised to drop in this afternoon.

Grace. Oh! We shall hear all about Cairo.

Mrs. Phillimore. William is judicious. [Thomas returns.

Miss Heneage. [With finality.] Cousin William will disapprove
of the match unless a winter in Cairo has altered his moral
tone.

Thomas. [Announcing.] Mr. Sudley.

He ushers in William Sudley, a little oldish gentleman. He is and
appears thoroughly insignificant. But his opinion of the place
he occupies in the world is enormous. His manners, voice,
presence, are all those of a man of breeding and self-importance.

Mrs. Phillimore and Miss Heneage. [Rising and greeting
Sudley; a little tremulously.] My dear William!


[Thomas withdraws.


Sudley. [Shakes hands with Mrs. Phillimore, soberly glad
to see them.] How d'ye do, Mary? [Greeting Miss Heneage.]
A very warm May you're having, Sarah.

Grace. [Coming forward to welcome him.] Dear Cousin
William!

Miss Heneage. Wasn't it warm in Cairo when you left?

She will have the strict truth, or nothing; still, on account of Sudley's
impeccable respectability, she treats him with more than
usual leniency.

Sudley. [Sitting down.] We left Cairo six weeks ago, Grace,
so I've had no news since you wrote in February that Philip was
engaged. [After a pause.] I need not to say I consider Philip's
engagement excessively regrettable. He is a judge upon the
Supreme Court bench with a divorced wife&mdash;and such a divorced
wife![Pg 616]

Grace. Oh, but Philip has succeeded in keeping everything as
quiet as possible.

Sudley. [Acidly.] No, my dear! He has not succeeded in
keeping his former wife as quiet as possible. We had not been
in Cairo a week when who should turn up but Vida Phillimore.
She went everywhere and did everything no woman should!

Grace. [With unfeigned interest.] Oh, what did she do?

Sudley. She "did" Cleopatra at the tableaux at Lord Errington's!
She "did" Cleopatra, and she did it robed only in some
diaphanous material of a nature so transparent that&mdash;in fact she
appeared to be draped in moonshine. [Miss Heneage indicates
the presence of Grace and rises.] That was only the beginning.
As soon as she heard of Philip's engagement, she gave a dinner in
honour of it! Only divorc&eacute;es were asked! And she had a dummy&mdash;yes,
my dear, a dummy!&mdash;at the head of the table. He stood
for Philip&mdash;that is he sat for Philip!


[Rising and moving to the table.


Miss Heneage. [Irritated and disgusted.] Ah!

Mrs. Phillimore. [With dismay and pain.] Dear me!

Miss Heneage. [Confident of the value of her opinion.] I disapprove
of Mrs. Phillimore.

Sudley. [Taking a cigarette.] Of course you do, but has Philip
taken to Egyptian cigarettes in order to celebrate my winter at
Cairo?

Grace. Those are Cynthia's.

Sudley. [Thinking that no one is worth knowing whom he does
not know.] Who is "Cynthia?"

Grace. Mrs. Karslake&mdash;She's staying here, Cousin William.
She'll be down in a minute.

Sudley. [Shocked.] You don't mean to tell me&mdash;?&mdash;!

Miss Heneage. Yes, William, Cynthia is Mrs. Karslake&mdash;Mrs.
Karslake has no New York house. I disliked the publicity
of a hotel in the circumstances, and, accordingly, when she
became engaged to Philip, I invited her here.

Sudley. [Suspicious and distrustful.] And may I ask who Mrs.
Karslake is?

Miss Heneage. [With confidence.] She was a Deane.

Sudley. [Walking about the room, sorry to be obliged to concede
good birth to any but his own blood.] Oh, oh&mdash;well, the Deanes are
extremely nice people. [Approaching the table.] Was her father
J. William Deane?[Pg 617]

Miss Heneage. [Nodding, still more secure.] Yes.

Sudley. [Giving in with difficulty.] The family is an old one.
J. William Deane's daughter? Surely he left a very considerable&mdash;

Miss Heneage. Oh, fifteen or twenty millions.

Sudley. [Determined not to be dazzled.] If I remember rightly
she was brought up abroad.

Miss Heneage. In France and England&mdash;and I fancy brought
up with a very gay set in very gay places. In fact she is what is
called a "sporty" woman.

Sudley. [Always ready to think the worst.] We might put up
with that. But you don't mean to tell me Philip has the&mdash;the&mdash;assurance
to marry a woman who has been divorced by&mdash;

Miss Heneage. Not at all. Cynthia Karslake divorced her
husband.

Sudley. [Gloomily, since he has less fault to find than he expected.]
She divorced him! Ah!


[He seeks the consolation of his tea.


Miss Heneage. The suit went by default. And, my dear
William, there are many palliating circumstances. Cynthia was
married to Karslake only seven months. There are no&mdash; [Glancing
at Grace] no hostages to Fortune! Ahem!

Sudley. [Still unwilling to be pleased.] Ah! What sort of a
young woman is she?

Grace. [With the superiority of one who is not too popular.]
Men admire her.

Miss Heneage. She's not conventional.

Mrs. Phillimore. [Showing a faint sense of justice.] I am
bound to say she has behaved discreetly ever since she arrived
in this house.

Miss Heneage. Yes, Mary&mdash;but I sometimes suspect that
she exercises a degree of self-control&mdash;

Sudley. [Glad to have something against some one.] She claps
on the lid, eh? And you think that perhaps some day she'll boil
over? Well, of course fifteen or twenty millions&mdash;but who's
Karslake?

Grace. [Very superciliously.] He owns Cynthia K. She's the
famous mare.

Miss Heneage. He's Henry Karslake's son.

Sudley. [Beginning to make the best of fifteen millions-in-law.]
Oh!&mdash;Henry!&mdash;Very respectable family. Although I remember[Pg 618]
his father served a term in the Senate. And so the wedding is
to be to-morrow?

Mrs. Phillimore. [Assenting.] To-morrow.

Sudley. [Rising, his respectability to the front when he thinks of
the ceremony. Grace rises.] To-morrow. Well, my dear Sarah,
a respectable family with some means. We must accept her.
But on the whole, I think it will be best for me not to see the
young woman. My disapprobation would make itself apparent.

Grace. [Whispering to Sudley.] Cynthia's coming.


[He doesn't hear.


Cynthia comes in, absorbed in reading a newspaper. She is a
young creature in her twenties, small and high-bred, full of the
love of excitement and sport. Her manner is wide-awake and
keen, and she is evidently in no fear of the opinion of others.
Her dress is exceedingly elegant, but with the elegance of a
woman whose chief interests lie in life out of doors. There is
nothing hard or masculine in her style, and her expression is
youthful and ingenuous.

Sudley. [Sententious and determinately epigrammatic.] The
uncouth modern young woman, eight feet high, with a skin like
a rhinoceros and manners like a cave-dweller&mdash;an habitu&eacute; of the
race-track and the divorce court&mdash;

Grace. [Aside to Sudley.] Cousin William!

Sudley. Eh, oh!

Cynthia. [Reading her newspaper, advances into the room,
immersed, excited, trembling. She lowers paper to catch the light.]
"Belmont favourite&mdash;six to one&mdash;Rockaway&mdash;Rosebud, and
Flying Cloud. Slow track&mdash;raw wind&mdash;h'm, h'm, h'm&mdash;At
the half, Rockaway forged ahead, when Rosebud under the lash
made a bold bid for victory&mdash;neck by neck&mdash;for a quarter&mdash;when
Flying Cloud slipped by the pair and won on the post by a
nose in one forty nine!" [Speaking with the enthusiasm of a sport.]
Oh, I wish I'd seen the dear thing do it. Oh, it's Mr. Sudley!
You must think me very rude. How do you do, Mr. Sudley?


[Going over to Sudley.


Sudley. [Bowing without cordiality.] Mrs. Karslake.

[Cynthia pauses, feeling he should say something. As he says
nothing, she speaks again.

Cynthia. I hope Cairo was delightful? Did you have a
smooth voyage?[Pg 619]

Sudley. [Pompously.] You must permit me, Mrs. Karslake&mdash;

Cynthia. [With good temper, somewhat embarrassed, and
talking herself into ease.] Oh, please don't welcome me to the
family. All that formal part is over, if you don't mind. I'm one
of the tribe now! You're coming to our wedding to-morrow?

Sudley. My dear Mrs. Karslake, I think it might be wiser&mdash;

Cynthia. [Still with cordial good temper.] Oh, but you must
come! I mean to be a perfect wife to Philip and all his relations!
That sounds rather miscellaneous, but you know what I mean.

Sudley. [Very sententious.] I am afraid&mdash;

Cynthia. [Gay and still covering her embarrassment.] If you
don't come, it'll look as if you were not standing by Philip when
he's in trouble! You'll come, won't you&mdash;but of course you
will.

Sudley. [After a self-important pause.] I will come, Mrs.
Karslake. [Pausing.] Good-afternoon. [In a tone of sorrow and
light compassion.] Good-bye, Mary. Good-afternoon, Sarah.
[Sighing.] Grace, dear. [To Miss Heneage.] At what hour did
you say the alimony commences?

Miss Heneage. [Quickly and commandingly to cover his slip.]
The ceremony is at three P. M., William.


[Sudley walks toward the door.


Mrs. Phillimore. [With fatigued voice and manner as she
rises.] I am going to my room to rest awhile.


[She trails slowly from the room.


Miss Heneage. [To Sudley.] Oh, William, one moment&mdash;I
entirely forgot! I've a most important social question to ask
you! [She accompanies him slowly to the door.] in regard to the
announcements of the wedding&mdash;who they shall be sent to and
who not. For instance&mdash;the Dudleys&mdash; [Deep in their talk,
Sudley and Miss Heneage pass out together.

Cynthia. [From the sofa.] So that's Cousin William?

Grace. [From the tea-table.] Don't you like him?

Cynthia. [Calmly sarcastic.] Like him? I love him. He's so
generous. He couldn't have received me with more warmth if
I'd been a mulatto.

Thomas comes in, preceded by Phillimore. Philip Phillimore
is a self-centered, short-tempered, imperious member of the
respectable fashionables of New York. He is well and solidly
dressed, and in manner and speech evidently a man of family.
He is accustomed to being listened to in his home circle and[Pg 620]
from the bench, and it is practically impossible for him to believe
that he can make a mistake.

Grace. [Outraged.] Really you know&mdash;      [Cynthia
moves to the table.] Philip!

Philip nods to Grace absent-mindedly. He is in his working suit
and looks tired. He walks into the room silently; goes over to
the tea-table, bends over and kisses Cynthia on the forehead.
Goes to his chair, which Thomas has moved to suit him. He
sits, and sighs with satisfaction.

Philip. [As if exhausted by brain work.] Ah, Grace! [Grace
immediately sails out of the room.] Well, my dear, I thought I
should never extricate myself from the court-room. You look
very debonnair!

Cynthia. The tea's making. You'll have your glass of sherry?

Philip. [The strain of the day evidently having been severe.]
Thanks! [Taking it from Thomas and sighing.] Ah!

Cynthia. I can see it's been a tiring day with you.

Philip. [His great tussle with the world leaving him unworsted
but utterly spent.] H'm!      [He gratefully sips his tea.

Cynthia. Were the lawyers very long-winded?

Philip. [Almost too tired for speech.] Prolix to the point of
somnolence. It might be affirmed without inexactitude that the
prolixity of counsel is the somnolence of the judiciary. I am
fatigued, ah! [A little suddenly, awaking to the fact that his orders
have not been carried out to the letter.] Thomas! My Post is not
in its usual place!

Cynthia. It's here, Philip.      [Thomas gets it.

Philip. Thanks, my dear. [Opening "The Post."] Ah! This
hour with you&mdash;is&mdash;is really the&mdash;the&mdash; [Absently.] the one vivid
moment of the day. [Reading.] H'm&mdash;shocking attack by the
President on vested interests. H'm&mdash;too bad&mdash;but it's to be
expected. The people insisted on electing a desperado to the
presidential office&mdash;they must take the hold-up that follows.
[After a pause, he reads.] H'm! His English is lacking in idiom,
his spelling in conservatism, his mind in balance, and his character
in repose.

Cynthia. [Amiable but not very sympathetic.] You seem more
fatigued than usual. Another glass of sherry, Philip?

Philip. Oh, I ought not to&mdash;

Cynthia. I think you seem a little more tired than usual.[Pg 621]

Philip. Perhaps I am. [She pours out sherry. Philip takes
glass but does not sip.] Ah, this hour is truly a grateful form of
restful excitement. [After an inspired interval.] You, too, find
it&mdash;eh?      [He looks at Cynthia.

Cynthia. [With veiled sarcasm.] Decidedly.

Philip. Decidedly what, my dear?

Cynthia. [Her sarcasm still veiled.] Restful.

Philip. H'm! Perhaps I need the calm more than you do.
Over the case to-day I actually&mdash;eh&mdash; [Sipping his tea.] slumbered.
I heard myself do it. That's how I know. A dressmaker
sued on seven counts. [Reading his newspaper.] Really, the
insanity of the United States Senate&mdash;you seem restless, my dear.
Ah&mdash;um&mdash;have you seen the evening paper? I see there has been
a lightning change in the style or size of hats which ladies&mdash;

[Sweeping a descriptive motion with his hand, he gives the paper to
Cynthia, then moves his glass, reads, and sips.

Cynthia. The lamp, Thomas.

Thomas blows out the alcohol lamp on the tea-table with difficulty.
Blows twice. Movement of Philip each time. Blows again.

Philip. [Irritably.] Confound it, Thomas! What are you
puffing and blowing at&mdash;?

Thomas. It's out, ma'am&mdash;yes, sir.

Philip. You're excessively noisy, Thomas!

Thomas. [In a fluster.] Yes, sir&mdash;I am.

Cynthia. [Soothing Thomas's wounded feelings.] We don't
need you, Thomas.

Thomas. Yes, ma'am.

Philip. Puffing and blowing and shaking and quaking like an
automobile in an ecstasy!      [Thomas meekly withdraws.

Cynthia. [Not unsympathetically.] Too bad, Philip! I hope
my presence isn't too agitating?

Philip. Ah&mdash;it's just because I value this hour with you,
Cynthia&mdash;this hour of tea and toast and tranquillity. It's quite
as if we were married&mdash;happily married&mdash;already.

Cynthia. [Admitting that married life is a blank, begins to look
through paper.] Yes, I feel as if we were married already.

Philip. [Not recognizing her tone.] Ah! It's the calm, you
see.

Cynthia. [Without warmth.] The calm? Yes&mdash;yes, it's&mdash;it's
the calm.[Pg 622]

Philip. [Sighs.] Yes, the calm&mdash;the Halcyon calm of&mdash;of
second choice. H'm! [He reads and turns over the leaves of the
paper. Cynthia reads. There is a silence.] After all, my dear&mdash;the
feeling which I have for you&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;eh&mdash;the market is in a
shocking condition of plethora! H'm&mdash;h'm&mdash;and what are you
reading?

Cynthia. [Embarrassed.] Oh, eh&mdash;well&mdash;I&mdash;eh&mdash;I'm just
running over the sporting news.

Philip. Oh!      [He looks thoughtful.

Cynthia. [Beginning to forget Philip and to remember more
interesting matters.] I fancied Hermes would come in an easy
winner. He came in nowhere. Nonpareil was ridden by Henslow&mdash;he's
a rotten bad rider. He gets nervous.

Philip. [Still interested in his newspaper.] Does he? H'm!
I suppose you do retain an interest in horses and races. H'm&mdash;I
trust some day the&mdash;ah&mdash;law will attract&mdash;Oh [Turning a
page.], here's the report of my opinion in that dressmaker's case&mdash;Haggerty
vs. Phillimore.

Cynthia. [Puzzled.] Was the case brought against you?

Philip. Oh&mdash;no. The suit was brought by Haggerty, Miss
Haggerty, a dressmaker, against the&mdash;in fact, my dear, against
the former Mrs. Phillimore.      [After a pause, he returns to his
reading.

Cynthia. [Curious about the matter.] How did you decide it?

Philip. I was obliged to decide in Mrs. Phillimore's favour.
Haggerty's plea was preposterous.

Cynthia. Did you&mdash;did you meet the&mdash;the&mdash;former&mdash;?

Philip. No.

Cynthia. I often see her at afternoon teas.

Philip. How did you recognize&mdash;

Cynthia. Why&mdash; [Opening the paper.] because Mrs. Vida
Phillimore's picture appears in every other issue of most of the
evening papers. And I must confess I was curious. But, I'm
sure you find it very painful to meet her again.

Philip. [Slowly, considering.] No,&mdash;would you find it so
impossible to meet Mr.&mdash;

Cynthia. [Much excited and aroused.] Philip! Don't speak of
him. He's nothing. He's a thing of the past. I never think of
him. I forget him!

Philip. [Somewhat sarcastic.] That's extraordinarily original
of you to forget him.[Pg 623]

Cynthia. [Gently, and wishing to drop the subject.] We each of
us have something to forget, Philip&mdash;and John Karslake is to
me&mdash;Well, he's dead!

Philip. As a matter of fact, my dear, he is dead, or the next
thing to it&mdash;for he's bankrupt.

Cynthia. [After a pause.] Bankrupt? [Excited and moved.]
Let's not speak of him. I mean never to see him or think about
him or even hear of him! [He assents. She reads her paper. He
sips his tea and reads his paper. She turns a page, starts and cries
out.

Philip. God bless me!

Cynthia. It's a picture of&mdash;of&mdash;

Philip. John Karslake?

Cynthia. Picture of him, and one of me, and in the middle
between us "Cynthia K!"

Philip. "Cynthia K!"

Cynthia. [Excited.] My pet riding mare! The best horse he
has! She's an angel even in a photograph! Oh! [Reading.]
"John Karslake drops a fortune at Saratoga." [Rises and walks
up and down excitedly. Philip takes the paper and reads.

Philip. [Unconcerned, as the matter hardly touches him.] Hem&mdash;ah&mdash;Advertises
country place for sale&mdash;stables, famous
mare "Cynthia K"&mdash;favourite riding-mare of former Mrs. Karslake,
who is once again to enter the arena of matrimony with the
well-known and highly respected judge of&mdash;

Cynthia. [Sensitive and much disturbed.] Don't! Don't,
Philip, please don't!

Philip. My dear Cynthia&mdash;take another paper&mdash;here's my
Post! You'll find nothing disagreeable in The Post.


[Cynthia takes paper.


Cynthia. [After reading, near the table.] It's much worse in
The Post. "John Karslake sells the former Mrs. Karslake's
jewels&mdash;the famous necklace now at Tiffany's, and the sporty
ex-husband sells his wife's portrait by Sargent!" Philip, I can't
stand this.      [Puts paper on the table.

Philip. Really, my dear, Mr. Karslake is bound to appear
occasionally in print&mdash;or even you may have to meet him.


[Thomas comes in.


Cynthia. [Determined and distressed.] I won't meet him! I
won't meet him. Every time I hear his name or "Cynthia K's"
I'm so depressed.[Pg 624]

Thomas. [Announcing with something like reluctance.] Sir, Mr.
Fiddler. Mr. Karslake's trainer.

Fiddler walks in. He is an English horse trainer, a wide-awake,
stocky, well-groomed little cockney. He knows his own mind and
sees life altogether through a stable door. Well-dressed for his
station, and not too young.

Cynthia. [Excited and disturbed.] Fiddler? Tim Fiddler?
His coming is outrageous!

Fiddler. A note for you, sir.

Cynthia. [Impulsively.] Oh, Fiddler&mdash;is that you?

Fiddler. Yes'm!

Cynthia. [In a half whisper, still speaking on impulse.] How
is she! Cynthia K? How's Planet II and the colt and Golden
Rod? How's the whole stable? Are they well?

Fiddler. No'm&mdash;we're all on the bum. [Aside.] Ever since
you kicked us over!

Cynthia. [Reproving him, though pleased.] Fiddler!

Fiddler. The horses is just simply gone to Egypt since you
left, and so's the guv'nor.

Cynthia. [Putting an end to Fiddler.] That will do, Fiddler.

Fiddler. I'm waiting for an answer, sir.

Cynthia. What is it, Philip?

Philip. [Uncomfortable.] A mere matter of business. [Aside
to Fiddler.] The answer is, Mr. Karslake can come. The&mdash;the
coast will be clear.      [Fiddler goes out.

Cynthia. [Amazed; rising.] You're not going to see him?

Philip. But Karslake, my dear, is an old acquaintance of
mine. He argues cases before me. I will see that you do not have
to meet him.

[Cynthia walks the length of the room in excited dejection.

Matthew comes in. He is a High-church clergyman to a highly
fashionable congregation. His success is partly due to his social
position and partly to his elegance of speech, but chiefly to his
inherent amiability, which leaves the sinner in happy peace
and smiles on the just and unjust alike.

Matthew. [Most amiably.] Ah, my dear brother!

Philip. [Greeting him.] Matthew.

Matthew. [Nodding to Philip.] Good afternoon, my dear
Cynthia. How charming you look! [Cynthia sits down at the[Pg 625]
tea-table. To Cynthia.] Ah, why weren't you in your pew
yesterday? I preached a most original sermon.


[He lays his hat and cane on the divan.


Thomas. [Aside to Philip.] Sir, Mrs. Vida Phillimore's maid
called you up on the telephone, and you're to expect Mrs. Phillimore
on a matter of business.

Philip. [Astonished and disgusted.] Here, impossible! [To
Cynthia.] Excuse me, my dear!      [Philip, much embarrassed,
goes out, followed by Thomas.

Matthew. [Approaching Cynthia's chair, happily and
pleasantly self-important.] No, really, it was a wonderful sermon,
my dear. My text was from Paul&mdash;"It is better to marry than to
burn." It was a strictly logical sermon. I argued&mdash;that, as the
grass withereth, and the flower fadeth,&mdash;there is nothing final in
Nature; not even Death! And, as there is nothing final in
Nature, not even Death;&mdash;so then if Death is not final&mdash;why
should marriage be final? [Gently.] And so the necessity of&mdash;eh&mdash;divorce!
You see? It was an exquisite sermon! All New York
was there! And all New York went away happy! Even the
sinners&mdash;if there were any! I don't often meet sinners&mdash;do you?

Cynthia. [Indulgently, in spite of his folly, because he is kind.]
You're such a dear, delightful Pagan! Here's your tea!

Matthew. [Taking the tea.] Why, my dear&mdash;you have a very
sad expression!

Cynthia. [A little bitterly.] Why not?

Matthew. [With sentimental sweetness.] I feel as if I were of
no use in the world when I see sadness on a young face. Only
sinners should feel sad. You have committed no sin!

Cynthia. [Impulsively.] Yes, I have!

Matthew. Eh?

Cynthia. I committed the unpardonable sin&mdash;whe&mdash;when I
married for love!

Matthew. One must not marry for anything else, my dear!

Cynthia. Why am I marrying your brother?

Matthew. I often wonder why? I wonder why you didn't
choose to remain a free woman.

Cynthia. [Going over the ground she has often argued with herself.]
I meant to; but a divorc&eacute;e has no place in society. I felt
horridly lonely! I wanted a friend. Philip was ideal as a friend&mdash;for
months. Isn't it nice to bind a friend to you?

Matthew. [Setting down his teacup.] Yes&mdash;yes![Pg 626]

Cynthia. [Growing more and more excited and moved as she
speaks.] To marry a friend&mdash;to marry on prudent, sensible
grounds&mdash;a man&mdash;like Philip? That's what I should have done
first, instead of rushing into marriage&mdash;because I had a wild, mad,
sensitive, sympathetic&mdash;passion and pain and fury&mdash;of, I don't
know what&mdash;that almost strangled me with happiness!

Matthew. [Amiable and reminiscent.] Ah&mdash;ah&mdash;in my
youth&mdash;I,&mdash;I too!

Cynthia. [Coming back to her manner of every day.] And besides&mdash;the
day Philip asked me I was in the dumps! And now&mdash;how
about marrying only for love?      [Philip comes back.

Matthew. Ah, my dear, love is not the only thing in the
world!

Philip. [Half aside.] I got there too late, she'd hung up.

Cynthia. Who, Philip?

Philip. Eh&mdash;a lady&mdash;eh&mdash;


[Thomas, flurried, comes in with a card on a salver.


Thomas. A card for you, sir. Ahem&mdash;ahem&mdash;Mrs. Phillimore&mdash;that
was, sir.

Philip. Eh?

Thomas. She's on the stairs, sir. [He nods backward, only to
find Vida at his side. He announces her as being the best way of
meeting the difficulty.] Mrs. Vida Phillimore!

Vida comes in slowly, with the air of a spoiled beauty. She stops
just inside the door and speaks in a very casual manner. Her
voice is languorous and caressing. She is dressed in the excess
of the French fashion and carries a daring parasol. She smiles
and comes in, undulating, to the middle of the room. Tableau.
Thomas withdraws.

Vida. How do you do, Philip. [After a pause.] Don't tell
me I'm a surprise! I had you called up on the 'phone and I sent
up my card&mdash;and, besides, Philip dear, when you have the&mdash;the&mdash;habit
of the house, as unfortunately I have, you can't treat yourself
like a stranger in a strange land. At least, I can't&mdash;so here I
am. My reason for coming was to ask you about that B. &amp; O.
stock we hold in common. [To Matthew, condescendingly, the
clergy being a class of unfortunates debarred by profession from the
pleasures of the world.] How do you do? [Pause. She then goes
to the real reason of her visit.] Do be polite and present me to
your wife-to-be.[Pg 627]

Philip. [Awkwardly.] Cynthia&mdash;

Cynthia. [Cheerfully, with dash, putting the table between Vida
and herself.] We're delighted to see you, Mrs. Phillimore. I
needn't ask you to make yourself at home, but will you have a
cup of tea?      [Matthew sits near the little table.

Vida. [To Philip.] My dear, she's not in the least what I
expected. I heard she was a dove! She's a very dashing kind of
a dove! [To Cynthia, who moves to the tea-table.] My dear, I'm
paying you compliments. Five lumps and quantities of cream.
I find single life very thinning. [To Philip, calm and ready to be
agreeable to any man.] And how well you're looking! It must be
the absence of matrimonial cares&mdash;or is it a new angel in the
house?

Cynthia. [Outraged at Vida's intrusion, but polite though delicately
sarcastic.] It's most amusing to sit in your place. And
how at home you must feel here in this house where you have
made so much trouble&mdash;I mean tea. [Rises.] Do you know it
would be in much better taste if you would take the place you're
accustomed to?

Vida. [As calm as before.] My dear, I'm an intruder only for
a moment; I sha'n't give you a chance to score off me again!
But I must thank you, dear Philip, for rendering that decision in
my favour&mdash;

Philip. I assure you&mdash;

Vida. [Unable to resist a thrust.] Of course, you would like to
have rendered it against me. It was your wonderful sense of justice,
and that's why I'm so grateful&mdash;if not to you, to your
Maker!

Philip. [Feels that this is no place for his future wife. Rises
quickly. To Cynthia.] Cynthia, I would prefer that you left us.


[Matthew moves to the sofa and sits down.


Cynthia. [Determined not to leave the field first, remains seated.]
Certainly, Philip!

Philip. I expect another visitor who&mdash;

Vida. [With flattering insistence, to Cynthia.] Oh, my dear&mdash;don't
go! The truth is&mdash;I came to see you! I feel most cordially
towards you&mdash;and really, you know, people in our position should
meet on cordial terms.

Cynthia. [Taking it with apparent calm, but pointing her remarks.]
Naturally. If people in our position couldn't meet, New
York society would soon come to an end.      [Thomas comes in.[Pg 628]

Vida. [Calm, but getting her knife in too.] Precisely. Society's
no bigger than a band-box. Why, it's only a moment ago I saw
Mr. Karslake walking&mdash;

Cynthia. Ah!

Thomas. [Announcing clearly. Everyone changes place, in consternation,
amusement or surprise. Cynthia moves to leave the
room, but stops for fear of attracting Karslake's attention.] Mr.
John Karslake!

Enter Karslake. He is a powerful, generous personality, a man
of affairs, breezy, gay and careless. He gives the impression of
being game for any fate in store for him. His clothes indicate
sporting propensities and his taste in waistcoats and ties is
brilliant. Karslake sees first Philip and then Matthew.
Thomas goes out.

Philip. How do you do?

John. [Very gay and no respecter of persons.] Good-afternoon,
Mr. Phillimore. Hello&mdash;here's the church! [Crossing to Matthew
and shaking hands. He slaps him on the back.] I hadn't the
least idea&mdash;how are you? By George, your reverence, that was a
racy sermon of yours on Divorce! What was your text? [Sees
Vida and bows, very politely.] Galatians 4:2, "The more the
merrier," or "Who next?" [Smiles.] As the whale said after
Jonah! [Cynthia makes a sudden movement, upsetting her tea-cup.
John faces about quickly and they face each other. John gives a
frank start. A pause holds them.

John. [Astounded, in a low voice.] Mrs. Karslake&mdash; [Bowing.]
I was not aware of the pleasure in store for me. I understood
you were in the country. [Recovering and moving to her chair.]
Perhaps you'll be good enough to make me a cup of tea?&mdash;that is
if the teapot wasn't lost in the scrimmage. [There is another
pause. Cynthia, determined to equal him in coolness, returns to
the tea-tray.] Mr. Phillimore, I came to get your signature in
that matter of Cox vs. Keely.

Philip. I shall be at your service, but pray be seated.


[He indicates a chair by the tea-table.


John. [Sitting beyond but not far from the tea-table.] And I also
understood you to say you wanted a saddle-horse.

Philip. You have a mare called&mdash;eh&mdash;"Cynthia K?"

John. [Promptly.] Yes&mdash;she's not for sale.

Philip. Oh, but she's just the mare I had set my mind on.[Pg 629]

John. [With a touch of humour.] You want her for
yourself?

Philip. [A little flustered.] I&mdash;eh&mdash;I sometimes ride.

John. [Now sure of himself.] She's rather lively for you,
Judge. Mrs. Karslake used to ride her.

Philip. You don't care to sell her to me?

John. She's a dangerous mare, Judge, and she's as delicate
and changeable as a girl. I'd hate to leave her in your
charge!

Cynthia. [Eagerly but in a low voice.] Leave her in mine, Mr.
Karslake!

John. [After a slight pause.] Mrs. Karslake knows all about
a horse, but&mdash; [Turning to Cynthia.] Cynthia K's got rather
tricky of late.

Cynthia. [Haughtily.] You mean to say you think she'd
chuck me?

John. [With polite solicitude and still humourous. To Philip.]
I'd hate to have a mare of mine deprive you of a wife, Judge.
[Rises. Cynthia shows anger.] She goes to Saratoga next
week, C. W.

Vida. [Who has been sitting and talking to Matthew for lack
of a better man, comes to talk to Karslake.] C. W.?

John. [Rising as she rises.] Creditors willing.

Vida. [Changing her seat for one near the tea-table.] I'm sure
your creditors are willing.

John. Oh, they're a breezy lot, my creditors. They're giving
me a dinner this evening.

Vida. [More than usually anxious to please.] I regret I'm not
a breezy creditor, but I do think you owe it to me to let me see
your Cynthia K! Can't you lead her around to my house?

John. At what hour, Mrs. Phillimore?

Vida. Say eleven? And you, too, might have a leading in my
direction&mdash;771 Fifth Avenue.

[John bows. Cynthia hears and notes this.


Cynthia. Your cup of tea, Mr. Karslake.

John. Thanks. [Taking his tea and sipping it.] I beg your
pardon&mdash;you have forgotten, Mrs. Karslake&mdash;very naturally, it
has slipped your memory, but I don't take sugar. [Cynthia,
furious with him and herself. He hands the cup back. She makes
a second cup.

Cynthia. [Cheerfully; in a rage.] Sorry![Pg 630]

John. [Also apparently cheerful.] Yes, gout. It gives me a
twinge even to sit in the shadow of a sugar-maple! First you riot,
and then you diet!

Vida. [Calm and amused; aside to Matthew.] My dear
Matthew, he's a darling! But I feel as if we were all taking tea
on the slope of a volcano!      [Matthew sits down.

Philip. It occurred to me, Mr. Karslake, you might be glad to
find a purchaser for your portrait by Sargent?

John. It's not my portrait. It's a portrait of Mrs. Karslake,
and to tell you the truth&mdash;Sargent's a good fellow&mdash;I've made up
my mind to keep it&mdash;to remember the artist by.


[Cynthia is wounded by this.


Philip. H'm!


[Cynthia hands a second cup to John.


Cynthia. [With careful politeness.] Your cup of tea, Mr.
Karslake.

John. [Rising and taking the tea with courteous indifference.]
Thanks&mdash;sorry to trouble you.


[He drinks the cup of tea standing by the tea-table.


Philip. [To make conversation.] You're selling your country
place?

John. If I was long of hair&mdash;I'd sell that.

Cynthia. [Excited. Taken out of herself by the news.] You're
not really selling your stable?

John. [Finishes his tea, places the empty cup on the tea-table,
and reseats himself.] Every gelding I've got&mdash;seven foals and a
donkey! I don't mean the owner.

Cynthia. [Still interested and forgetting the discomfort of the
situation.] How did you ever manage to come such a cropper?

John. Streak of blue luck!

Cynthia. [Quickly.] I don't see how it's possible&mdash;

John. You would if you'd been there. You remember the
head man? [Sitting down.] Bloke?

Cynthia. Of course!

John. Well, his wife divorced him for beating her over the
head with a bottle of Fowler's Solution, and it seemed to prey on
his mind. He sold me&mdash;

Cynthia. [Horrified.] Sold a race?

John. About ten races, I guess.

Cynthia. [Incredulous.] Just because he'd beaten his wife?

John. No. Because she divorced him.[Pg 631]

Cynthia. Well, I can't see why that should prey on his mind!


[Suddenly remembers.


John. Well, I have known men that it stroked the wrong
way. But he cost me eighty thousand. And then Urbanity ran
third in the thousand-dollar stakes for two-year-olds at Belmont.

Cynthia. [Throws this remark in.] I never had faith in that
horse.

John. And, of course, it never rains monkeys but it pours
gorillas! So when I was down at St. Louis on the fifth, I laid
seven to three on Fraternity&mdash;

Cynthia. Crazy! Crazy!

John. [Ready to take the opposite view.] I don't see it. With
her record she ought to have romped it an easy winner.

Cynthia. [Her sporting instinct asserting itself.] She hasn't
the stamina! Look at her barrel!

John. Well, anyhow, Geranium finished me!

Cynthia. You didn't lay odds on Geranium!

John. Why not? She's my own mare&mdash;

Cynthia. Oh!

John. Streak o' bad luck&mdash;

Cynthia. [Plainly anxious to say "I told you so."] Streak of
poor judgment! Do you remember the day you rode Billy at a
six-foot stone wall, and he stopped and you didn't, and there was
a hornet's nest [Matthew rises.] on the other side, and I remember
you were hot just because I said you showed poor judgment?
[She laughs at the memory. A general movement of disapproval.
She remembers the situation.] I beg your pardon.

Matthew. [Rises to meet Vida. Hastily.] It seems to me
that horses are like the fourth gospel. Any conversation about
them becomes animated almost beyond the limits of the urbane!
[Vida, disgusted by such plainness of speech, rises and goes to Philip
who waves her to a chair.

Philip. [Formally.] I regret that you have endured such
reverses, Mr. Karslake.      [John quietly bows.

Cynthia. [Concealing her interest and speaking casually.] You
haven't mentioned your new English horse&mdash;Pantomime. What
did he do at St. Louis?

John. [Sitting down.] Fell away and ran fifth.

Cynthia. Too bad. Was he fully acclimated? Ah, well&mdash;

John. We always differed&mdash;you remember&mdash;on the time
needed[Pg 632]&mdash;

Matthew. [Coming over to Cynthia, and speaking to carry off
the situation as well as to get a tip.] Isn't there a&mdash;eh&mdash;a race to-morrow
at Belmont Park?

John. Yes. I'm going down in my auto.

Cynthia. [Evidently wishing she might be going too.] Oh!

Matthew. And what animal shall you prefer?


[Covering his personal interest with amiable altruism.


John. I'm backing Carmencita.

Cynthia. [With a gesture of despair.] Carmencita! Carmencita!


[Matthew returns to Vida's side.


John. You may remember we always differed on Carmencita.

Cynthia. [Disgusted at John's dunderheadedness.] But there's
no room for difference. She's a wild, headstrong, dissatisfied,
foolish little filly. The deuce couldn't ride her&mdash;she'd shy at her
own shadow&mdash;"Carmencita." Oh, very well then, I'll wager
you&mdash;and I'll give you odds too&mdash;"Decorum" will come in first,
and I'll lay three to one he'll beat Carmencita by five lengths!
How's that for fair?

John. [Never forgetting the situation.] Sorry I'm not flush
enough to take you.

Cynthia. [Impetuously.] Philip, dear, you lend John enough
for the wager.

Matthew. [As nearly horrified as so soft a soul can be.] Ahem!
Really&mdash;

John. It's a sporty idea, Mrs. Karslake, but perhaps in the
circumstances&mdash;

Cynthia. [Her mind on her wager.] In what circumstances?

Philip. [With a nervous laugh.] It does seem to me there is a
certain impropriety&mdash;

Cynthia. [Remembering the conventions, which, for a moment,
had actually escaped her.] Oh, I forgot. When horses are in the
air&mdash;

Matthew. [Pouring oil on troubled waters. Moving, he speaks
to Vida from the back of her armchair.] It's the fourth gospel, you
see. [Thomas comes in with a letter on a salver, which he hands to
Philip.

Cynthia. [Meekly.] You are quite right, Philip. [Philip
goes up.] The fact is, seeing Mr. Karslake again [Laying on her
indifference with a trowel.] he seems to me as much a stranger as
if I were meeting him for the first time.[Pg 633]

Matthew. [Aside to Vida.] We are indeed taking tea on the
slope of a volcano.

Vida. [About to go, but thinking she will have a last word with
John.] I'm sorry your fortunes are so depressed, Mr. Karslake.

Philip. [Looking at the card that Thomas has just brought in.]
Who in the world is Sir Wilfrid Cates-Darby?


[There is a general stir.


John. Oh&mdash;eh&mdash;Cates-Darby? [Philip opens the letter which
Thomas has brought with the card.] That's the English chap I
bought Pantomime of.

Philip. [To Thomas.] Show Sir Wilfrid Cates-Darby in.

Thomas goes out. The prospect of an Englishman with a handle
to his name changes Vida's plans and, instead of leaving the
house, she goes to sofa, and poses there.

John. He's a good fellow, Judge. Place near Epsom. Breeder.
Over here to take a shy at our races.

Thomas. [Opening the door and announcing.] Sir Wilfrid
Cates-Darby.

Enter Sir Wilfrid Cates-Darby. He is a high-bred, sporting
Englishman. His manner, his dress and his diction are the perfection
of English elegance. His movements are quick and graceful.
He talks lightly and with ease. He is full of life and unsmiling
good temper.

Philip. [To Sir Wilfrid and referring to the letter of introduction
in his hand.] I am Mr. Phillimore. I am grateful to Stanhope
for giving me the opportunity of knowing you, Sir Wilfrid.
I fear you find it warm?

Sir Wilfrid. [Delicately mopping his forehead.] Ah, well&mdash;ah&mdash;warm,
no&mdash;hot, yes! Deuced extraordinary climate yours,
you know, Mr. Phillimore.

Philip. [Conventionally.] Permit me to present you to&mdash; [The
unconventional situation pulls him up short. It takes him a
moment to decide how to meet it. He makes up his mind to pretend
that everything is as usual, and presents Cynthia first.] Mrs.
Karslake.

[Sir Wilfrid bows, surprised and doubtful.

Cynthia. How do you do?

Philip. And to Mrs. Phillimore. [Vida bows nonchalantly,
but with a view to catching Sir Wilfrid's attention. Sir Wilfrid[Pg 634]
bows, and looks from her to Philip.] My brother&mdash;and Mr.
Karslake you know.

Sir Wilfrid. How do, my boy. [Half aside, to John.] No
idea you had such a charming little wife&mdash;What?&mdash;Eh?
[Karslake moves to speak to Matthew and Philip in the further
room.

Cynthia. You'll have a cup of tea, Sir Wilfrid?

Sir Wilfrid. [At the table.] Thanks, awfully. [Very cheerfully.]
I'd no idea old John had a wife! The rascal never told
me!

Cynthia. [Pouring tea and facing the facts.] I'm not Mr.
Karslake's wife!

Sir Wilfrid. Oh!&mdash;Eh?&mdash;I see&mdash;


[He is evidently trying to think this out.


Vida. [Who has been ready for some time to speak to him.] Sir
Wilfrid, I'm sure no one has asked you how you like our
country?

Sir Wilfrid. [Going to Vida and standing by her at the sofa.]
Oh, well, as to climate and horses, I say nothing. But I like your
American humour. I'm acquiring it for home purposes.

Vida. [Getting down to love as the basis of conversation.] Aren't
you going to acquire an American girl for home purposes?

Sir Wilfrid. The more narrowly I look the agreeable project
in the face, the more I like it. Oughtn't to say that in the presence
of your husband. [He casts a look at Philip, who has gone into
the next room.

Vida. [Cheerful and unconstrained.] He's not my husband!

Sir Wilfrid. [Completely confused.] Oh&mdash;eh?&mdash;my brain
must be boiled. You are&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;eh&mdash;ah&mdash;of course, now I see!
I got the wrong names! I thought you were Mrs. Phillimore.
[Sitting down by her.] And that nice girl, Mrs. Karslake! You're
deucedly lucky to be Mrs. Karslake. John's a prime sort. I say,
have you and he got any kids? How many?

Vida. [Horrified at being suspected of maternity, but speaking
very sweetly.] He's not my husband.

Sir Wilfrid. [His good spirits all gone, but determined to clear
things up.] Phew! Awfully hot in here! Who the deuce is
John's wife?

Vida. He hasn't any.

Sir Wilfrid. Who's Phillimore's wife?

Vida. He hasn't any.[Pg 635]

Sir Wilfrid. Thanks, fearfully! [To Matthew, whom he
approaches; suspecting himself of having lost his wits.] Would you
excuse me, my dear and Reverend Sir&mdash;you're a churchman and
all that&mdash;would you mind straightening me out?

Matthew. [Most graciously.] Certainly, Sir Wilfrid. Is it a
matter of doctrine?

Sir Wilfrid. Oh, damme&mdash;beg your pardon,&mdash;no, it's not
words, it's women.

Matthew. [Ready to be outraged.] Women!

Sir Wilfrid. It's divorce. Now, the lady on the
sofa&mdash;

Matthew. Was my brother's wife; he divorced her&mdash;incompatibility&mdash;Rhode
Island. The lady at the tea-table was Mr.
Karslake's wife; she divorced him&mdash;desertion&mdash;Sioux Falls.
One moment&mdash;she is about to marry my brother.

Sir Wilfrid. [Cheerful again.] I'm out! Thought I never
would be! Thanks!      [Vida laughs.

Vida. [Not a whit discountenanced and ready to please.] Have
you got me straightened out yet?

Sir Wilfrid. Straight as a die! I say, you had lots of fun,
didn't you? [Returning to his position by the sofa.] And so she's
Mrs. John Karslake?

Vida. [Calm, but secretly disappointed.] Do you like her?

Sir Wilfrid. My word!

Vida. [Fully expecting personal flattery.] Eh?

Sir Wilfrid. She's a box o' ginger!

Vida. You haven't seen many American women!

Sir Wilfrid. Oh, haven't I?

Vida. If you'll pay me a visit to-morrow&mdash;at twelve, you shall
meet a most charming young woman, who has seen you once, and
who admires you&mdash;ah!

Sir Wilfrid. I'm there&mdash;what!

Vida. Seven hundred and seventy-one Fifth Avenue.

Sir Wilfrid. Seven seventy-one Fifth Avenue&mdash;at twelve.

Vida. At twelve.

Sir Wilfrid. Thanks! [Indicating Cynthia.] She's a
thoroughbred&mdash;you can see that with one eye shut. Twelve.
[Shaking hands.] Awfully good of you to ask me. [He joins
John.] I say, my boy, your former's an absolute certainty.
[To Cynthia.] I hear you're about to marry Mr. Phillimore,
Mrs. Karslake?[Pg 636]

Karslake crosses to Vida and together they move to the sofa and
sit down.

Cynthia. To-morrow, 3 P. M., Sir Wilfrid.

Sir Wilfrid. [Much taken with Cynthia.] Afraid I've run
into a sort of family party, eh? [Indicating Vida.] The Past and
the Future&mdash;awfully chic way you Americans have of asking your
divorced husbands and wives to drop in, you know&mdash;celebrate a
christenin', or the new bride, or&mdash;

Cynthia. Do you like your tea strong?

Sir Wilfrid. Middlin'.

Cynthia. Sugar?

Sir Wilfrid. One!

Cynthia. Lemon?

Sir Wilfrid. Just torture a lemon over it. [He makes a gesture
as of twisting a lemon peel. She hands him his tea.] Thanks!
So you do it to-morrow at three?

Cynthia. At three, Sir Wilfrid.

Sir Wilfrid. Sorry!

Cynthia. Why are you sorry?

Sir Wilfrid. Hate to see a pretty woman married. Might
marry her myself.

Cynthia. Oh, but I'm sure you don't admire American
women.

Sir Wilfrid. Admire you, Mrs. Karslake&mdash;

Cynthia. Not enough to marry me, I hope.

Sir Wilfrid. Marry you in a minute! Say the word. Marry
you now&mdash;here.

Cynthia. You don't think you ought to know me a little
before&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. Know you? Do know you.

Cynthia. [Covering her hair with her handkerchief.] What
colour is my hair?

Sir Wilfrid. Pshaw!

Cynthia. You see! You don't know whether I'm a chestnut
or a strawberry roan! In the States we think a few months of
friendship is quite necessary.

Sir Wilfrid. Few months of moonshine! Never was a friend
to a woman&mdash;thank God, in all my life.

Cynthia. Oh&mdash;oh, oh!

Sir Wilfrid. Might as well talk about being a friend to a
whiskey-and-soda.[Pg 637]

Cynthia. A woman has a soul, Sir Wilfrid.

Sir Wilfrid. Well, good whiskey is spirits&mdash;dozens o'
souls!

Cynthia. You are so gross!

Sir Wilfrid. [Changing his seat for one at the tea-table.] Gross?
Not a bit! Friendship between the sexes is all fudge! I'm no
friend to a rose in my garden. I don't call it friendship&mdash;eh&mdash;eh&mdash;a
warm, starry night, moonbeams and ilex trees, "and a spirit
who knows how" and all that&mdash;eh&mdash; [Getting closer to her.]
You make me feel awfully poetical, you know&mdash; [Philip
comes toward them, glances nervously at Cynthia and Sir Wilfrid,
and walks away again.] What's the matter? But, I say&mdash;poetry
aside&mdash;do you, eh&mdash;&mdash; [Looking around to place Philip.] Does
he&mdash;y'know&mdash;is he&mdash;does he go to the head?

Cynthia. Sir Wilfrid, Mr. Phillimore is my sober second
choice.

Sir Wilfrid. Did you ever kiss him? I'll bet he fined you for
contempt of court. Look here, Mrs. Karslake, if you're marryin'
a man you don't care about&mdash;

Cynthia. [Amused and excusing his audacity as a foreigner's
eccentricity.] Really!

Sir Wilfrid. Well, I don't offer myself&mdash;

Cynthia. Oh!

Sir Wilfrid. Not this instant&mdash;

Cynthia. Ah!

Sir Wilfrid. But let me drop in to-morrow at ten.

Cynthia. What country and state of affairs do you think you
have landed in?

Sir Wilfrid. New York, by Jove! Been to school, too. New
York is bounded on the North, South, East and West by the
state of Divorce! Come, come, Mrs. Karslake, I like your
country. You've no fear and no respect&mdash;no cant and lots of can.
Here you all are, you see&mdash;your former husband, and your new
husband's former wife&mdash;sounds like Ollendoff! Eh? So there
you are, you see! But, jokin' apart&mdash;why do you marry him?
Oh, well, marry him if you must! You can run around the corner
and get a divorce afterwards&mdash;

Cynthia. I believe you think they throw one in with an ice-cream
soda!

Sir Wilfrid. [Rising.] Damme, my dear lady, a marriage in
your country is no more than a&mdash;eh&mdash;eh&mdash;what do you call 'em?[Pg 638]
A thank you, ma'am. That's what an American marriage is&mdash;a
thank you, ma'am. Bump&mdash;bump&mdash;you're over it and on to the
next.

Cynthia. You're an odd fish! What? I believe I like you!

Sir Wilfrid. 'Course you do! You'll see me when I call to-morrow&mdash;at
ten? We'll run down to Belmont Park, eh?

Cynthia. Don't be absurd!

Vida. [Has finished her talk with John, and breaks in on Sir
Wilfrid, who has hung about Cynthia too long to suit her.] To-morrow
at twelve, Sir Wilfrid!

Sir Wilfrid. Twelve!

Vida. [Shaking hands with John.] Don't forget, Mr. Karslake&mdash;eleven
o'clock to-morrow.

John. [Bowing assent.] I won't!

Vida. [Coming over to Cynthia.] Oh, Mrs. Karslake, I've
ordered Tiffany to send you something. It's a sugar-bowl to
sweeten the matrimonial lot! I suppose nothing would induce
you to call?

Cynthia. [Distantly and careless of offending.] Thanks, no&mdash;that
is, is "Cynthia K" really to be there at eleven? I'd give a
gold mine to see her again.

Vida. Do come!

Cynthia. If Mr. Karslake will accommodate me by his
absence.

Vida. Dear Mr. Karslake, you'll have to change your
hour.

John. Sorry, I'm not able to.

Cynthia. I can't come later for I'm to be married.

John. It's not as bad as that with me, but I am to be sold up&mdash;Sheriff,
you know. Can't come later than eleven.

Vida. [To Cynthia.] Any hour but eleven, dear.

Cynthia. [Perfectly regardless of Vida, and ready to vex John
if possible.] Mrs. Phillimore, I shall call on you at eleven&mdash;to
see Cynthia K. I thank you for the invitation. Good-afternoon.

Vida. [Aside to John, crossing to speak quietly to him.] It's
mere bravado; she won't come.

John. You don't know her.

There is a pause and general embarrassment. Sir Wilfrid uses
his eye-glass. John angry. Cynthia triumphant. Matthew
embarrassed. Vida irritated. Philip puzzled. Everybody is at
odds.[Pg 639]

Sir Wilfrid. [For the first time a witness to the pretty complications
of divorce. To Matthew.] Do you have it as warm as this
ordinarily?

Matthew. [For whom these moments are more than usually
painful, and wiping his brow.] It's not so much the heat as the
humidity.

John. [Looks at watch and, relieved, glad to be off.] I shall be
late for my creditors' dinner.

Sir Wilfrid. [Interested and walking toward John.] Creditors'
dinner.

John. [Reading the note.] Fifteen of my sporting creditors
have arranged to give me a blow-out at Sherry's, and I'm
expected right away or sooner. And, by the way, I was to bring
my friends&mdash;if I had any. So now's the time to stand by me!
Mrs. Phillimore?

Vida. Of course!

John. [Ready to embarrass Cynthia, if possible, and speaking
as if he had quite forgotten their former relations.] Mrs. Karslake&mdash;I
beg your pardon. Judge? [Philip declines.] No? Sir Wilfrid?

Sir Wilfrid. I'm with you!

John. [To Matthew.] Your Grace?

Matthew. I regret&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. Is it the custom for creditors&mdash;

John. Come on, Sir Wilfrid! [Thomas opens door.] Good-night,
Judge&mdash;Your Grace&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. Is it the custom&mdash;

John. Hang the custom! Come on&mdash;I'll show you a gang of
creditors worth having!

Sir Wilfrid and John go out, arm in arm, preceded by Vida.
Matthew crosses the room, smiling, as if pleased, in a Christian
way, with this display of generous gaiety. He stops short suddenly
and looks at his watch.

Matthew. Good gracious! I had no idea the hour was so
late. I've been asked to a meeting with Maryland and Iowa, to
talk over the divorce situation. [He leaves the room quickly and
his voice is heard in the hall.] Good-afternoon! Good-afternoon!

Cynthia is evidently much excited. The outer door slams. Philip
comes down slowly. Cynthia stands, her eyes wide, her
breathing visible, until Philip speaks, when she seems suddenly
to realize her position. There is a long pause.[Pg 640]

Philip. [With a superior air.] I have seldom witnessed a more
amazing cataclysm of jocundity! Of course, my dear, this has
all been most disagreeable for you.

Cynthia. [Excitedly.] Yes, yes, yes!

Philip. I saw how much it shocked your delicacy.

Cynthia. [Distressed and moved.] Outrageous.


[Philip sits down.


Philip. Do be seated, Cynthia. [Taking up the paper.
Quietly.] Very odd sort of an Englishman&mdash;that Cates-Darby!

Cynthia. Sir Wilfrid?&mdash;Oh, yes! [Philip settles down to the
paper. To herself.] Outrageous! I've a great mind to go at
eleven&mdash;just as I said I would!

Philip. Do sit down, Cynthia!

Cynthia. What? What?

Philip. You make me so nervous&mdash;

Cynthia. Sorry&mdash;sorry. [She sits down and, seeing the paper,
takes it, looking at the picture of John Karslake.

Philip. [Sighing with content.] Ah! now that I see him, I don't
wonder you couldn't stand him. There's a kind of&mdash;ah&mdash;spontaneous
inebriety about him. He is incomprehensible! If I
might with reverence cross-question the Creator, I would say to
him: "Sir, to what end or purpose did you create Mr. John
Karslake?" I believe I should obtain no adequate answer! However,
[Sighs.] at last we have peace&mdash;and The Post! [Philip,
settling himself, reads his paper; Cynthia, glancing at her paper,
occasionally looks across at Philip.] Forget the dust of the arena&mdash;the
prolixity of counsel&mdash;the involuntary fatuity of things in
general. [After a pause, he goes on with his reading.] Compose
yourself!

Miss Heneage, Mrs. Phillimore and Grace come in. Cynthia
sighs without letting her sigh be heard. She tries to compose
herself. She glances at the paper and then, hearing Miss Heneage,
starts slightly. Miss Heneage and Mrs. Phillimore
stop at the table.

Miss Heneage. [Carrying a sheet of paper.] There, my dear
Mary, is the announcement as I have now reworded it. I took
William's suggestion. [Mrs. Phillimore takes and casually
reads it.] I also put the case to him, and he was of the opinion
that the announcement should be sent only to those people who[Pg 641]
are really in society. [She sits near the table. Cynthia braces herself
to bear the Phillimore conversation.

Grace. I wish you'd make an exception of the Dudleys.


[Cynthia rises and moves to the chair by the table.


Miss Heneage. And, of course, that excludes the Oppenheims&mdash;the
Vance-Browns.

Mrs. Phillimore. It's just as well to be exclusive.

Grace. I do wish you'd make an exception of Lena
Dudley.

Miss Heneage. We might, of course, include those new
Girardos, and possibly&mdash;possibly the Paddingtons.

Grace. I do wish you would take in Lena Dudley.


[They are now sitting.


Mrs. Phillimore. The mother Dudley is as common as a
charwoman, and not nearly as clean.

Philip. [Sighing, his own feelings, as usual, to the fore.] Ah!
I certainly am fatigued!

Cynthia begins to slowly crush the newspaper she has been reading
with both hands, as if the effort of self-repression were too much
for her.

Miss Heneage. [Making the best of a gloomy future.] We shall
have to ask the Dudleys sooner or later to dine, Mary&mdash;because
of the elder girl's marriage to that dissolute French Marquis.

Mrs. Phillimore. [Plaintively.] I don't like common people
any more than I like common cats, and of course in my time&mdash;

Miss Heneage. I think I shall include the Dudleys.

Mrs. Phillimore. You think you'll include the Dudleys?

Miss Heneage. Yes, I think I will include the Dudleys!

Here Cynthia's control breaks down. Driven desperate by their
chatter, she has slowly rolled her newspaper into a ball, and at
this point tosses it violently to the floor and bursts into hysterical
laughter.

Mrs. Phillimore. Why, my dear Cynthia&mdash;Compose yourself.

Philip. [Hastily.] What is the matter, Cynthia?


[They speak together.


Miss Heneage. Why, Mrs. Karslake, what is the matter?

Grace. [Coming quickly forward.] Mrs. Karslake!



Curtain.




[Pg 642]
ACT II.

Scene. Mrs. Vida Phillimore's boudoir. The room is furnished
to please an empty-headed, pleasure-loving and fashionable
woman. The furniture, the ornaments, what pictures there are,
all witness to taste up-to-date. Two French windows open on to a
balcony, from which the trees of Central Park can be seen. There
is a table between them; a mirror, a scent bottle, &amp;c., upon it. On
the right, up stage, is a door; on the right, down stage, another
door. A lady's writing-table stands between the two, nearer centre
of stage. There is another door up stage; below it, an open fireplace,
filled with potted plants, andirons, &amp;c., not in use. Over it
is a tall mirror; on the mantel-piece are a French clock, candelabra,
vases, &amp;c. On a line with the fireplace is a lounge, gay with silk
pillows. A florist's box, large and long, filled with American
Beauty roses, rests on a low table near the head of the lounge.
Small tables and light chairs where needed.

Benson, alone in the room, is looking critically about her. She is
a neat and pretty little English lady's maid in black silk and a
thin apron. Still surveying the room, she moves here and there,
and, her eyes lighting on the box of flowers, she goes to the door of
Vida's room and speaks to her.

Benson. Yes, ma'am, the flowers have come.

She holds open the door through which Vida, in a morning gown,
comes in slowly. She is smoking a cigarette in as &aelig;sthetic a
manner as she can, and is evidently turned out in her best style
for conquest.

Vida. [Faces the balcony as she speaks, and is, as always,
even and civil, but a bit disdainful toward her servant.] Terribly
garish light, Benson. Pull down the&mdash; [Benson, obeying, partly
pulls down the shade.] Lower still&mdash;that will do. [As she speaks
she goes about the room, giving the tables a push here and the chairs a
jerk there, and generally arranging the vases and ornaments.] Men
hate a clutter of chairs and tables. [Stopping and taking up a
hand mirror from the table, she faces the windows.] I really think
I'm too pale for this light.

Benson. [Quickly, understanding what is implied.] Yes,
ma'am. [Benson goes out for the rouge, and Vida seats herself at
the table. There is a knock at the door.] Come! [Brooks comes
in.[Pg 643]

Brooks. [An ultra-English footman, in plush and calves.] Any
horders, m'lady?

Vida. [Incapable of remembering the last man, or of considering
the new one.] Oh,&mdash;of course! You're the new&mdash;

Brooks. Footman, m'lady.

Vida. [As a matter of form.] Your name?

Brooks. Brooks, m'lady. [Benson returns with the
rouge.

Vida. [Carefully giving instructions while she keeps her eyes on
the glass and is rouged by Benson.] Brooks, I am at home to Mr.
Karslake at eleven; not to any one else till twelve, when I expect
Sir Wilfrid Cates-Darby.


[Brooks, watching Benson, is inattentive.


Brooks. Yes, m'lady.

Vida. [Calm, but wearied by the ignorance of the lower classes.]
And I regret to inform you, Brooks, that in America there are no
ladies, except salesladies!

Brooks. [Without a trace of comprehension.] Yes, m'lady.

Vida. I am at home to no one but the two names I have mentioned.
[Brooks bows and exits. She dabs on rouge while Benson
holds glass.] Is the men's club-room in order?

Benson. Perfectly, ma'am.

Vida. Whiskey and soda?

Benson. Yes, ma'am, and the ticker's been mended. The
British sporting papers arrived this morning.

Vida. [Looking at her watch which lies on the dressing-table.]
My watch has stopped.

Benson. [Glancing at the French clock on the chimney-piece.]
Five to eleven, ma'am.

Vida. [Getting promptly to work.] H'm, h'm, I shall be caught.
[Rising.] The box of roses, Benson! [Benson brings the box of
roses, uncovers the flowers and places them at Vida's side.] My
gloves&mdash;the clippers, and the vase! [Each of these things Benson
places in turn within Vida's range where she sits on the sofa. She
has the long box of roses at her side on a small table, a vase of water
on the floor by her side. She cuts the stems and places the roses in the
vase. When she feels that she has reached a picturesque position, in
which any onlooker would see in her a creature filled with the love of
flowers and of her fellow man, she says:] There! [The door opens
and Brooks comes in; Vida nods to Benson.

Brooks. [Announcing stolidly.] Sir John Karslake.[Pg 644]

John, dressed in very nobby riding togs, comes in gaily and forcibly.
Benson withdraws as he enters, and is followed by Brooks.
Vida, from this moment on, is busied with her roses.

Vida. [Languorously, but with a faint suggestion of humour.]
Is that really you, Sir John?

John. [Lively and far from being impressed by Vida.] I see now
where we Americans are going to get our titles. Good-morning!
You look as fresh as paint. [He lays his gloves and riding crop on
the table, and takes a chair.

Vida. [Facing the insinuation with gentle pain.] I hope you
don't mean that? I never flattered myself for a moment you'd
come. You're riding Cynthia K?

John. Fiddler's going to lead her round here in ten minutes!

Vida. Cigars and cigarettes! Scotch?


[Indicating a small table.


John. Scotch! [Goes up quickly to table and helps himself to
Scotch and seltzer.

Vida. And now do tell me all about her! [Putting in her last
roses; she keeps one rosebud in her hand, of a size suitable for a
man's buttonhole.

John. [As he drinks.] Oh, she's an adorable creature&mdash;delicate,
high-bred, sweet-tempered&mdash;

Vida. [Showing her claws for a moment.] Sweet-tempered?
Oh, you're describing the horse! By "her," I meant&mdash;

John. [Irritated by the remembrance of his wife.] Cynthia
Karslake? I'd rather talk about the last Tornado.


[He drops moodily into a chair.


Vida. [With artful soothing.] There is only one thing I want
to talk about, and that is, you! Why were you unhappy?

John. [Still cross.] Why does a dollar last such a short
time?

Vida. [Curious.] Why did you part?

John. Did you ever see a schooner towed by a tug? Well, I
parted from Cynthia for the same reason that the hawser parts
from the tug&mdash;I couldn't stand the tug.

Vida. [Sympathizing.] Ah!

John. [After a pause, and still cross.] Awful cheerful morning
chat.

Vida. [Excusing her curiosity and coming back to love as the
only subject for serious conversation.] I must hear the story, for
I'm anxious to know why I've taken such a fancy to you![Pg 645]

John. [Very nonchalantly.] Why do I like you?

Vida. [Doing her best to charm.] I won't tell you&mdash;it would
flatter you too much.

John. [Not a bit impressed by Vida, but humanly ready to
flirt.] Tell me!

Vida. There's a rose for you.


[Giving him the one she has in her hand.


John. [Saying what is plainly expected of him.] I want more
than a rose&mdash;

Vida. [Passing over this insinuation.] You refuse to tell
me&mdash;?

John. [Once more reminded of Cynthia, speaks with sudden
feeling.] There's nothing to tell. We met, we loved, we married,
we parted; or at least we wrangled and jangled. [Sighs.] Ha!
Why weren't we happy? Don't ask me, why! It may have been
partly my fault!

Vida. [With tenderness.] Never!

John. [His mind on Cynthia.] But I believe it's all in the
way a girl's brought up. Our girls are brought up to be ignorant
of life&mdash;they're ignorant of life. Life is a joke, and marriage is a
picnic, and a man is a shawl-strap&mdash; 'Pon my soul, Cynthia
Deane&mdash;no, I can't tell you! [In great irritation, he rises abruptly,
and strides up and down the room.

Vida. [Gently.] Please tell me!

John. Well, she was an heiress, an American heiress&mdash;and
she'd been taught to think marriage meant burnt almonds and
moonshine and a yacht and three automobiles, and she thought&mdash;I
don't know what she thought, but I tell you, Mrs. Phillimore,
marriage is three parts love and seven parts forgiveness of sins.
[He continues restlessly to pace the floor as he speaks of Cynthia.

Vida. [Flattering him as a matter of second nature.] She never
loved you.

John. [On whom she has made no impression at all.] Yes, she
did. For six or seven months there was not a shadow between us.
It was perfect, and then one day she went off like a pistol-shot!
I had a piece of law work and couldn't take her to see Flashlight
race the Maryland mare. The case meant a big fee, big Kudos,
and in sails Cynthia, Flashlight-mad! And will I put on my hat
and take her? No&mdash;and bang she goes off like a stick o' dynamite&mdash;what
did I marry her for?&mdash;and words&mdash;pretty high words,
until she got mad, when she threw over a chair, and said, oh, well,&mdash;marriage[Pg 646]
was a failure, or it was with me, so I said she'd better try
somebody else. She said she would, and marched out of the room.

Vida. [Gently sarcastic.] But she came back!

John. She came back, but not as you mean. She stood at the
door and said, "Jack, I shall divorce you." Then she came over
to my study-table, dropped her wedding ring on my law papers,
and went out. The door shut, I laughed; the front door slammed,
I damned. [After a silence, moving abruptly to the window.] She
never came back. [He turns away and then, recovering, moves
toward Vida, who catches his hands.

Vida. [Hoping for a contradiction.] She's broken your heart.

John. [Taking a chair by the lounge.] Oh, no!

Vida. [Encouraged, begins to play the game again.] You'll
never love again!

John. [Speaking to her from the foot of the sofa.] Try me! Try
me! Ah, no, Mrs. Phillimore, I shall laugh, live, love and make
money again! And let me tell you one thing&mdash;I'm going to rap
her one over the knuckles. She had a stick of a Connecticut
lawyer, and he&mdash;well, to cut a legal story short, since Mrs. Karslake's
been in Europe, I have been quietly testing the validity of
the decree of divorce. Perhaps you don't understand?

Vida. [Displaying her innate shrewdness.] Oh, about a divorce,
everything!

John. I shall hear by this evening whether the divorce will
stand or not.

Vida. But it's to-day at three she marries&mdash;you won't let her
commit bigamy?

John. [Shaking his head.] I don't suppose I'd go as far as
that. It may be the divorce will hold, but anyway I hope never
to see her again.

[He sits down beside her so that their faces are now directly opposite.
Taking advantage of the close range, her eyes, without loss of time,
open a direct fire.

Vida. Ah, my poor boy, she has broken your heart. [Believing
that this is her psychological moment, she lays her hand on his arm,
but draws it back as soon as he attempts to take it.] Now don't make
love to me.

John. [Bold and amused, but never taken in.] Why not?

Vida. [With immense gentleness.] Because I like you too
much! [More gaily.] I might give in, and take a notion to like
you still more![Pg 647]

John. Please do!

Vida. [With gush, and determined to be womanly at all hazards.]
Jack, I believe you'd be a lovely lover!

John. [Immensely diverted.] Try me!

Vida. [Not hoping much from his tone.] You charming,
tempting, delightful fellow, I could love you without the least
effort in the world,&mdash;but, no!

John. [Playing the game.] Ah, well, now seriously! Between
two people who have suffered and made their own mistakes&mdash;

Vida. [Playing the game too, but not playing it well.] But you
see, you don't really love me!

John. [Still ready to say what is expected.] Cynthia&mdash;Vida,
no man can sit beside you and look into your eyes without
feeling&mdash;

Vida. [Speaking the truth as she sees it, seeing that her methods
don't succeed.] Oh! That's not love! That's simply&mdash;well, my
dear Jack, it's beginning at the wrong end. And the truth is you
hate Cynthia Karslake with such a whole-hearted hate, that you
haven't a moment to think of any other woman.

John. [With sudden anger.] I hate her!

Vida. [Very softly and most sweetly.] Jack&mdash;Jack, I could be
as foolish about you as&mdash;oh, as foolish as anything, my dear!
And perhaps some day&mdash;perhaps some day you'll come to me and
say, Vida, I am totally indifferent to Cynthia&mdash;and then&mdash;

John. And then?

Vida. [The ideal woman in mind.] Then, perhaps, you and I
may join hands and stroll together into the Garden of Eden. It
takes two to find the Garden of Eden, you know&mdash;and once we're
on the inside, we'll lock the gate.

John. [Gaily, and seeing straight through her veneer.] And lose
the key under a rose-bush!

Vida. [Agreeing very softly.] Under a rose-bush! [There is a
very soft knock at which John starts up quickly.] Come! [Brooks
comes in, with Benson close at his heels.

Brooks. [Stolid, announces.] My lady&mdash;Sir Wilf&mdash; [Benson
stops him with a sharp movement and turns toward Vida.

Benson. [With intention.] Your dressmaker, ma'am. [Benson
waves Brooks to go and Brooks very haughtily complies.

Vida. [Wonderingly.] My dressmaker, Benson? [With quick
intelligence.] Oh, of course, show her up. Mr. Karslake, you
won't mind for a few minutes using my men's club-room? Benson[Pg 648]
will show you! You'll find cigars and the ticker, sporting
papers, whiskey; and, if you want anything special, just 'phone
down to my "chef."

John. [Looking at his watch.] How long?

Vida. [Very anxious to please.] Half a cigar! Benson will
call you.

John. [Practically-minded.] Don't make it too long. You see,
there's my sheriff's sale on at twelve, and those races this afternoon.
Fiddler will be here in ten minutes, remember!


[The door opens.


Vida. [To John.] Run along! [John leaves and Vida,
instantly practical, makes a broad gesture to Benson.] Everything
just as it was, Benson! [Benson whisks the roses out of the vase and
replaces them in the box. She gives Vida scissors and empty vases,
and, when Vida finds herself in precisely the same position which
preceded John's entrance, she says:] There!


[Brooks comes in as Vida takes a rose from basket.


Brooks. [With characteristic stolidness.] Your ladyship's
dressmaker! M'lady! [Enter Sir Wilfrid in morning suit,
boutonni&egrave;re, &amp;c.

Vida. [With tender surprise and busy with the roses.] Is that
really you, Sir Wilfrid! I never flattered myself for an instant
that you'd remember to come.

Sir Wilfrid. [Moving to the head of the sofa.] Come? 'Course
I come! Keen to come see you. By Jove, you know, you look
as pink and white as a huntin' mornin'.

Vida. [Ready to make any man as happy as possible.] You'll
smoke?

Sir Wilfrid. Thanks! [He watches her as she trims and arranges
the flowers.] Awfully long fingers you have! Wish I was
a rose, or a ring, or a pair of shears! I say, d'you ever notice what
a devil of a fellow I am for originality, what? [Unlike John, is
evidently impressed by her.] You've got a delicate little den up
here! Not so much low livin' and high thinkin', as low lights and
no thinkin' at all, I hope&mdash;eh?

[By this time, Vida has filled a vase with roses and rises to sweep
by him and, if possible, make another charming picture to his eyes.

Vida. [Gliding gracefully past him.] You don't mind my
moving about?

Sir Wilfrid. [Impressed.] Not if you don't mind my
watchin'. [Sitting down on the sofa.] And sayin' how wel you do it.[Pg 649]

Vida. It's most original of you to come here this morning. I
don't quite see why you did.

She places the roses here and there, as if to see their effect, and leaves
them on a small table near the door through which her visitors
entered.

Sir Wilfrid. Admiration.

Vida. [Sauntering slowly toward the mirror as she speaks.]
Oh, I saw that you admired her! And of course, she did say she
was coming here at eleven! But that was only bravado! She
won't come, and besides, I've given orders to admit no one!

Sir Wilfrid. [Attempting to dam the stream of her talk which
flows gently but steadily on.] May I ask you&mdash;

Vida. And, indeed, if she came now, Mr. Karslake has gone,
and her sole object in coming was to make him uncomfortable.
[She moves toward the table, stopping a half minute at the mirror
to see that she looks as she wishes to look.] Very dangerous symptom,
too, that passionate desire to make one's former husband
unhappy! But, I can't believe that your admiration for Cynthia
Karslake is so warm that it led you to pay me this visit a half
hour too early in the hope of seeing&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. [Rising; most civil, but speaking his mind like a
Briton.] I say, would you mind stopping a moment! [She
smiles.] I'm not an American, you know; I was brought up not
to interrupt. But you Americans, it's different with you! If
somebody didn't interrupt you, you'd go on forever.

Vida. [Passing him to tantalize.] My point is you come to
see Cynthia&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. [Believing she means it.] I came hopin' to see&mdash;

Vida. [Provokingly.] Cynthia!

Sir Wilfrid. [Perfectly single-minded and entirely taken in.]
But I would have come even if I'd known&mdash;

Vida. [Evading him, while he follows.] I don't believe it!

Sir Wilfrid. [Protesting whole-heartedly.] Give you my word
I&mdash;

Vida. [Leading him on.] You're here to see her! And of
course&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. [Determined to be heard because, after all, he's a
man.] May I have the&mdash;eh&mdash;the floor? [Vida sits down in a
chair.] I was jolly well bowled over with Mrs. Karslake, I admit
that, and I hoped to see her here, but[Pg 650]&mdash;

Vida. [Talking nonsense and knowing it.] You had another
object in coming. In fact, you came to see Cynthia, and you
came to see me! What I really long to know is, why you wanted
to see me! For, of course, Cynthia's to be married at three!
And, if she wasn't she wouldn't have you!

Sir Wilfrid. [Not intending to wound; merely speaking the
flat truth.] Well, I mean to jolly well ask her.

Vida. [Indignant.] To be your wife?

Sir Wilfrid. Why not?

Vida. [Still indignant.] And you came here, to my house&mdash;in
order to ask her&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. [Truthful even on a subtle point.] Oh, but that's
only my first reason for coming, you know.

Vida. [Concealing her hopes.] Well, now I am curious&mdash;what
is the second?

Sir Wilfrid. [Simply.] Are you feelin' pretty robust?

Vida. I don't know!

Sir Wilfrid. [Crosses to the buffet.] Will you have something,
and then I'll tell you!

Vida. [Gaily.] Can't I support the news without&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. [Trying to explain his state of mind, a feat which
he has never been able to accomplish.] Mrs. Phillimore, you see it's
this way. Whenever you're lucky, you're too lucky. Now, Mrs.
Karslake is a nipper and no mistake, but as I told you, the very
same evenin' and house where I saw her&mdash;


[He attempts to take her hand.


Vida. [Gently rising and affecting a tender surprise.] What!

Sir Wilfrid. [Rising with her.] That's it!&mdash;You're over! [He
suggests with his right hand the movement of a horse taking a hurdle.

Vida. [Very sweetly.] You don't really mean&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. [Carried away for the moment by so much true
womanliness.] I mean, I stayed awake for an hour last night,
thinkin' about you.

Vida. [Speaking to be contradicted.] But, you've just told me&mdash;that
Cynthia&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. [Admitting the fact.] Well, she did&mdash;she did
bowl my wicket, but so did you&mdash;

Vida. [Taking him very gently to task.] Don't you think there's
a limit to&mdash;      [She sits down.

Sir Wilfrid. [Roused by so much loveliness of soul.] Now, see
here, Mrs. Phillimore! You and I are not bottle babies, eh, are[Pg 651]
we? You've been married and&mdash;I&mdash;I've knocked about, and we
both know there's a lot of stuff talked about&mdash;eh, eh, well, you
know:&mdash;the one and only&mdash;that a fellow can't be awfully well
smashed by two at the same time, don't you know! All rubbish!
You know it, and the proof of the puddin's in the eatin', I am!

Vida. [With gentle reproach.] May I ask where I come in?

Sir Wilfrid. Well, now, Mrs. Phillimore, I'll be frank with
you, Cynthia's my favourite, but you're runnin' her a close
second in the popular esteem!

Vida. [Laughing, determined not to take offense.] What a
delightful, original, fantastic person you are!

Sir Wilfrid. [Frankly happy that he has explained everything so
neatly.] I knew you'd take it that way!

Vida. And what next, pray?

Sir Wilfrid. Oh, just the usual,&mdash;eh,&mdash;thing,&mdash;the&mdash;eh&mdash;the
same old question, don't you know. Will you have me if she don't?

Vida. [A shade piqued, but determined not to risk showing it.]
And you call that the same old usual question?

Sir Wilfrid. Yes, I know, but&mdash;but will you? I sail in a
week; we can take the same boat. And&mdash;eh&mdash;eh&mdash;my dear Mrs.&mdash;mayn't
I say Vida, I'd like to see you at the head of my table.

Vida. [With velvet irony.] With Cynthia at the foot?

Sir Wilfrid. [Practical, as before.] Never mind Mrs.
Karslake,&mdash;I admire her&mdash;she's&mdash;but you have your own points! And
you're here, and so'm I!&mdash;damme I offer myself, and my affections,
and I'm no icicle, my dear, tell you that for a fact, and,&mdash;and
in fact what's your answer!&mdash; [Vida sighs and shakes her
head.] Make it, yes! I say, you know, my dear Vida&mdash;


[He catches her hands.


Vida. [Drawing them from his.] Unhand me, dear villain!
And sit further away from your second choice! What can I say?
I'd rather have you for a lover than any man I know! You must
be a lovely lover!

Sir Wilfrid. I am!


[He makes a second effort to catch her fingers.


Vida. Will you kindly go further away and be good!

Sir Wilfrid. [Quite forgetting Cynthia.] Look here, if you
say yes, we'll be married&mdash;

Vida. In a month!

Sir Wilfrid. Oh, no&mdash;this evening![Pg 652]

Vida. [Incapable of leaving a situation unadorned.] This
evening! And sail in the same boat with you? And shall we sail to
the Garden of Eden and stroll into it and lock the gate on the
inside and then lose the key&mdash;under a rose-bush?

Sir Wilfrid. [After a pause and some consideration.] Yes;
yes, I say&mdash;that's too clever for me! [He draws nearer to her to
bring the understanding to a crisis.

Vida. [Interrupted by a soft knock.] My maid&mdash;come!

Sir Wilfrid. [Swinging out of his chair and moving to the sofa.] Eh?

Benson. [Coming in and approaching Vida.] The new footman,
ma'am&mdash;he's made a mistake. He's told the lady you're at
home.

Vida. What lady?

Benson. Mrs. Karslake; and she's on the stairs, ma'am.

Vida. Show her in.

Sir Wilfrid has been turning over the roses. On hearing this, he
faces about with a long stemmed one in his hand. He subsequently
uses it to point his remarks.

Sir Wilfrid. [To Benson, who stops.] One moment! [To Vida.] I say, eh&mdash;I'd rather not see her!

Vida. [Very innocently.] But you came here to see her.

Sir Wilfrid. [A little flustered.] I'd rather not. Eh,&mdash;I
fancied I'd find you and her together&mdash;but her&mdash; [Coming a step
nearer.] findin' me with you looks so dooced intimate,&mdash;no one
else, d'ye see, I believe she'd&mdash;draw conclusions&mdash;

Benson. Pardon me, ma'am&mdash;but I hear Brooks coming!

Sir Wilfrid. [To Benson.] Hold the door!

Vida. So you don't want her to know&mdash;?

Sir Wilfrid. [To Vida.] Be a good girl now&mdash;run me off
somewhere!

Vida. [To Benson.] Show Sir Wilfrid the men's room.


[Brooks comes in.


Sir Wilfrid. The men's room! Ah! Oh! Eh!

Vida. [Beckoning him to go at once.] Sir Wil&mdash; [He hesitates;
then as Brooks advances, he flings off with Benson.

Brooks. Lady Karslake, milady!

Vida. Anything more inopportune! I never dreamed she'd
come&mdash; [Cynthia comes in veiled. As she walks quickly into
the room, Vida greets her languorously.] My dear Cynthia, you
don't mean to say[Pg 653]&mdash;

Cynthia. [Rather short, and visibly agitated.] Yes, I've come.

Vida. [Polite, but not urgent.] Do take off your veil.

Cynthia. [Complying.] Is no one here?

Vida. [As before.] Won't you sit down?

Cynthia. [Agitated and suspicious.] Thanks, no&mdash;That is,
yes, thanks. Yes! You haven't answered my question?

[Cynthia waves her hand through the haze; glances suspiciously
at the smoke, and looks about for the cigarette.

Vida. [Playing innocence in the first degree.] My dear, what
makes you imagine that any one's here!

Cynthia. You've been smoking.

Vida. Oh, puffing away!      [Cynthia sees the glasses.

Cynthia. And drinking&mdash;a pair of drinks? [Her eyes lighting
on John's gloves on the table at her elbow.] Do they fit you, dear?
[Vida smiles; Cynthia picks up the crop and looks at it and reads
her own name.] "Jack, from Cynthia."

Vida. [Without taking the trouble to double for a mere woman.]
Yes, dear; it's Mr. Karslake's crop, but I'm happy to say he left
me a few minutes ago.

Cynthia. He left the house? [Vida smiles.] I wanted to see
him.

Vida. [With a shade of insolence.] To quarrel?

Cynthia. [Frank and curt.] I wanted to see him.

Vida. [Determined to put Cynthia in the wrong.] And I sent
him away because I didn't want you to repeat the scene of last
night in my house.

Cynthia. [Looks at crop and is silent.] Well, I can't stay. I'm
to be married at three, and I had to play truant to get here!


[Benson comes in.


Benson. [To Vida.] There's a person, ma'am, on the sidewalk.

Vida. What person, Benson?

Benson. A person, ma'am, with a horse.

Cynthia. [Happily agitated.] It's Fiddler with Cynthia K!


[She walks rapidly to the window and looks out.


Vida. [To Benson.] Tell the man I'll be down in five minutes.

Cynthia. [Looking down from the balcony with delight.] Oh,
there she is!

Vida. [Aside to Benson.] Go to the club-room, Benson, and
say to the two gentlemen I can't see them at present&mdash;I'll send
for them when[Pg 654]&mdash;

Benson. [Listening.] I hear some one coming.

Vida. Quick! [Benson leaves the door which opens and John comes in slowly, carelessly. Vida whispers to Benson.

Benson. [Moving close to John and whispering.] Beg par&mdash;

Vida. [Under her breath.] Go back!

John. [Not understanding.] I beg pardon!

Vida. [Scarcely above a whisper.] Go back!

John. [Dense.] Can't! I've a date! With the sheriff!

Vida. [A little cross.] Please use your eyes.

John. [Laughing and flattering Vida.] I am using my eyes.

Vida. [Fretted.] Don't you see there's a lovely creature in
the room?

John. [Not knowing what it is all about, but taking a wicked
delight in seeing her customary calm ruffled.] Of course there is.

Vida. Hush!

John. [Teasingly.] But what I want to know is&mdash;

Vida. Hush!

John. [Enjoying his fun.] &mdash;is when we're to stroll in the
Garden of Eden&mdash;

Vida. Hush!

John. &mdash;and lose the key. [To put a stop to this, she lightly
tosses her handkerchief into his face.] By George, talk about attar
of roses!

Cynthia. [At window, excited and moved at seeing her mare once
more.] Oh, she's a darling! [Turning.] A perfect darling!
[John starts up; he sees Cynthia at the same instant that she sees
him.] Oh! I didn't know you were here. [After a pause, with
"take-it-or-leave-it" frankness.] I came to see you! [John looks
extremely dark and angry; Vida rises.

Vida. [To Cynthia, most gently, and seeing there's nothing to
be gained of John.] Oh, pray feel at home, Cynthia, dear!
[Stopping by the door to her bedroom; to John.] When I've a nice
street frock on, I'll ask you to present me to Cynthia K. [Vida
opens the door and goes out. Cynthia and John involuntarily
exchange glances.

Cynthia. [Agitated and frank.] Of course, I told you yesterday
I was coming here.

John. [Irritated.] And I was to deny myself the privilege of
being here?

Cynthia. [Curt and agitated.] Yes.

John. [Ready to fight.] And you guessed I would do that?[Pg 655]

Cynthia. No.

John. What?

Cynthia. [Speaks with agitation, frankness and good will.]
Jack&mdash;I mean, Mr. Karslake,&mdash;no, I mean, Jack! I came because&mdash;well,
you see, it's my wedding day!&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;was
rude to you last evening. I'd like to apologize and make peace
with you before I go&mdash;

John. [Determined to be disagreeable.] Before you go to your
last, long home!

Cynthia. I came to apologize.

John. But you'll remain to quarrel!

Cynthia. [Still frank and kind.] I will not quarrel. No!&mdash;and
I'm only here for a moment. I'm to be married at three, and
just look at the clock! Besides, I told Philip I was going to
Louise's shop, and I did&mdash;on the way here; but, you see, if I stay
too long he'll telephone Louise and find I'm not there, and he
might guess I was here. So you see I'm risking a scandal. And
now, Jack, see here, I lay my hand on the table, I'm here on the
square, and,&mdash;what I want to say is, why&mdash;Jack, even if we have
made a mess of our married life, let's put by anger and pride.
It's all over now and can't be helped. So let's be human, let's be
reasonable, and let's be kind to each other! Won't you give me
your hand? [John refuses.] I wish you every happiness!

John. [Turning away, the past rankling.] I had a client once,
a murderer; he told me he murdered the man, and he told me,
too, that he never felt so kindly to anybody as he did to that man
after he'd killed him!

Cynthia. Jack!

John. [Unforgiving.] You murdered my happiness!

Cynthia. I won't recriminate!

John. And now I must put by anger and pride! I do! But
not self-respect, not a just indignation&mdash;not the facts and my
clear memory of them!

Cynthia. Jack!

John. No!

Cynthia. [With growing emotion, and holding out her hand.]
I give you one more chance! Yes, I'm determined to be generous.
I forgive everything you ever did to me. I'm ready to be friends.
I wish you every happiness and every&mdash;every&mdash;horse in the
world! I can't do more than that! [She offers it again.] You
refuse?[Pg 656]

John. [Moved but surly.] I like wildcats and I like Christians,
but I don't like Christian wildcats! Now I'm close hauled, trot
out your tornado! Let the Tiger loose! It's the tamer, the man
in the cage that has to look lively and use the red hot crowbar!
But, by Jove, I'm out of the cage! I'm a mere spectator of the
married circus!      [He puffs vigorously.

Cynthia. Be a game sport then! Our marriage was a wager;
you wagered you could live with me. You lost; you paid with
a divorce; and now is the time to show your sporting blood.
Come on, shake hands and part friends.

John. Not in this world! Friends with you, no! I have a
proper pride. I don't propose to put my pride in my
pocket.

Cynthia. [Jealous and plain spoken.] Oh, I wouldn't ask you
to put your pride in your pocket while Vida's handkerchief is
there. [John looks angered.] Pretty little bijou of a handkerchief!
[Pulling out the handkerchief.] And she is charming, and
divorced, and reasonably well made up.

John. Oh, well, Vida is a woman. [Toying with the handkerchief.]
I'm a man, a handkerchief is a handkerchief, and, as some
old Aristotle or other said, whatever concerns a woman, concerns
me!

Cynthia. [Not oblivious of him, but in a low voice.] Insufferable!
Well, yes. [She sits down. She is too much wounded to make
any further appeal.] You're perfectly right. There's no possible
harmony between divorced people! I withdraw my hand and all
good feeling. No wonder I couldn't stand you. Eh? However,
that's pleasantly past! But at least, my dear Karslake, let us
have some sort of beauty behaviour! If we cannot be decent, let
us endeavour to be graceful. If we can't be moral, at least we
can avoid being vulgar.

John. Well&mdash;

Cynthia. If there's to be no more marriage in the world&mdash;

John. [Cynically.] Oh, but that's not it; there's to be more
and more and more!

Cynthia. [With a touch of bitterness.] Very well! I repeat
then, if there's to be nothing but marriage and divorce, and re-marriage,
and re-divorce, at least, at least, those who are divorced
can avoid the vulgarity of meeting each other here, there, and
everywhere!

John. Oh, that's where you come out![Pg 657]

Cynthia. I thought so yesterday, and to-day I know it. It's
an insufferable thing to a woman of any delicacy of feeling to
find her husband&mdash;

John. Ahem&mdash;former!

Cynthia. Once a husband always&mdash;

John. [In the same cynical tone.] Oh, no! Oh, dear, no.

Cynthia. To find her&mdash;to find the man she has once lived with&mdash;in
the house of&mdash;making love to&mdash;to find you here! [John
smiles and rises.] You smile,&mdash;but I say, it should be a social
axiom, no woman should have to meet her former husband.

John. [Cynical and cutting.] Oh, I don't know; after I've
served my term I don't mind meeting my jailor.

Cynthia. [As John takes chair near her.] It's indecent&mdash;at
the horse-show, the opera, at races and balls, to meet the man
who once&mdash;It's not civilized! It's fantastic! It's half
baked! Oh, I never should have come here! [He sympathizes,
and she grows irrational and furious.] But it's entirely your
fault!

John. My fault?

Cynthia. [Working herself into a rage.] Of course. What
business have you to be about&mdash;to be at large. To be at all!

John. Gosh!

Cynthia. [Her rage increasing.] To be where I am! Yes, it's
just as horrible for you to turn up in my life as it would be for a
dead person to insist on coming back to life and dinner and bridge!

John. Horrid idea!

Cynthia. Yes, but it's you who behave just as if you were not
dead, just as if I'd not spent a fortune on your funeral. You do;
you prepare to bob up at afternoon teas,&mdash;and dinners&mdash;and
embarrass me to death with your extinct personality!

John. Well, of course we were married, but it didn't quite
kill me.

Cynthia. [Angry and plain spoken.] You killed yourself for
me&mdash;I divorced you. I buried you out of my life. If any human
soul was ever dead, you are! And there's nothing I so hate as a
gibbering ghost.

John. Oh, I say!

Cynthia. [With hot anger.] Go gibber and squeak where
gibbering and squeaking are the fashion!

John. [Laughing and pretending to a coldness he does not feel.]
And so, my dear child, I'm to abate myself as a nuisance! Well,[Pg 658]
as far as seeing you is concerned, for my part it's just like seeing
a horse who's chucked you once. The bruises are O. K., and you
see him with a sort of easy curiosity. Of course, you know, he'll
jolly well chuck the next man!&mdash;Permit me! [John picks up her
gloves, handkerchief and parasol, and gives her these as she drops
them one by one in her agitation.] There's pleasure in the
thought.

Cynthia. Oh!

John. And now, may I ask you a very simple question? Mere
curiosity on my part, but, why did you come here this
morning?

Cynthia. I have already explained that to you.

John. Not your real motive. Permit me!

Cynthia. Oh!

John. But I believe I have guessed your real&mdash;permit me&mdash;your
real motive!

Cynthia. Oh!

John. [With mock sympathy.] Cynthia, I am sorry for you.

Cynthia. H'm?

John. Of course we had a pretty lively case of the fever&mdash;the
mutual attraction fever, and we were married a very short time.
And I conclude that's what's the matter with you! You see, my
dear, seven months of married life is too short a time to cure a
bad case of the fancies.

Cynthia. [In angry surprise.] What?

John. [Calm and triumphant.] That's my diagnosis.

Cynthia. [Slowly and gathering herself together.] I don't think
I understand.

John. Oh, yes, you do; yes, you do.

Cynthia. [With blazing eyes.] What do you mean?

John. Would you mind not breaking my crop! Thank you!
I mean [With polite impertinence.] that ours was a case of premature
divorce, and, ahem, you're in love with me still.

He pauses. Cynthia has one moment of fury, then she realizes at
what a disadvantage this places her. She makes an immense effort,
recovers her calm, thinks hard for a moment more, and then, has
suddenly an inspiration.

Cynthia. Jack, some day you'll get the blind staggers from
conceit. No, I'm not in love with you, Mr. Karslake, but I
shouldn't be at all surprised if she were. She's just your sort,[Pg 659]
you know. She's a man-eating shark, and you'll be a toothsome
mouthful. Oh, come now, Jack, what a silly you are! Oh, yes,
you are, to get off a joke like that; me&mdash;in love with&mdash;


[She looks at him.


John. Why are you here? [She laughs and begins to play her
game.] Why are you here?

Cynthia. Guess!      [She laughs.

John. Why are you&mdash;

Cynthia. [Quickly.] Why am I here! I'll tell you. I'm going
to be married. I had a longing, an irresistible longing to see you
make an ass of yourself just once more! It happened!

John. [Uncertain and discomfited.] I know better!

Cynthia. But I came for a serious purpose, too. I came, my
dear fellow, to make an experiment on myself. I've been with
you thirty minutes; and&mdash; [She sighs with content.] It's all
right!

John. What's all right?

Cynthia. [Calm and apparently at peace with the world.] I'm
immune.

John. Immune?

Cynthia. You're not catching any more! Yes, you see, I said
to myself, if I fly into a temper&mdash;

John. You did!

Cynthia. If I fly into a temper when I see him, well, that shows
I'm not yet so entirely convalescent that I can afford to have
Jack Karslake at my house. If I remain calm I shall ask him to
dinner.

John. [Routed.] Ask me if you dare!      [He rises.

Cynthia. [Getting the whip hand for good.] Ask you to dinner?
Oh, my dear fellow. [John rises.] I'm going to do much more
than that. [She rises.] We must be friends, old man! We must
meet, we must meet often, we must show New York the way the
thing should be done, and, to show you I mean it&mdash;I want
you to be my best man, and give me away when I'm married this
afternoon.

John. [Incredulous and impatient.] You don't mean that!


[He pushes back his chair.


Cynthia. There you are! Always suspicious!

John. You don't mean that!

Cynthia. [Hiding her emotion under a sportswoman's manner.]
Don't I? I ask you, come! And come as you are! And I'll lay[Pg 660]
my wedding gown to Cynthia K that you won't be there! If
you're there, you get the gown, and if you're not, I get Cynthia K!&mdash;

John. [Determined not to be worsted.] I take it!

Cynthia. Done! Now, then, we'll see which of us two is the
real sporting goods! Shake! [They shake hands on it.] Would
you mind letting me have a plain soda? [John goes to the table,
and, as he is rattled and does not regard what he is about, he fills the
glass three-fourths full with whiskey. He gives this to Cynthia who
looks him in the eye with an air of triumph.] Thanks. [Maliciously,
as Vida enters.] Your hand is a bit shaky. I think you need a
little King William. [John shrugs his shoulders, and, as Vida
immediately speaks, Cynthia defers drinking.

Vida. [To Cynthia.] My dear, I'm sorry to tell you your
husband&mdash;I mean, my husband&mdash;I mean Philip&mdash;he's asking for
you over the 'phone. You must have said you were coming here.
Of course, I told him you were not here, and hung up.

Benson. [Entering hurriedly and at once moving to Vida.]
Ma'am, the new footman's been talking with Mr. Phillimore on
the wire. [Vida, gesture of regret.] He told Mr. Phillimore that
his lady was here, and, if I can believe my ears, ma'am, he's got
Sir Wilfrid on the 'phone now!

Sir Wilfrid. [Making his appearance, perplexed and annoyed.]
I say, y' know&mdash;extraordinary country; that old chap, Phillimore,
he's been damned impertinent over the wire! Says I've
run off with Mrs. Karslake&mdash;talks about "Louise!" Now, who
the dooce is Louise? He's comin' round here, too&mdash;I said Mrs.
Karslake wasn't here&mdash; [Seeing Cynthia.] Hello! Good job!
What a liar I am!

Benson. [Coming to the door. To Vida.] Mr. Fiddler, ma'am,
says the mare is gettin' very restive.

[John hears this and moves at once. Benson withdraws.

John. [To Vida.] If that mare's restive, she'll break out in a
rash.

Vida. [To John.] Will you take me?

John. Of course.      [They go to the door.

Cynthia. [To John.] Tata, old man! Meet you at the altar!
If I don't, the mare's mine!


[Sir Wilfrid looks at her amazed.


Vida. [To Cynthia.] Do the honours, dear, in my
absence![Pg 661]

John. Come along, come along, never mind them! A horse
is a horse!

John and Vida go out gaily and in haste. At the same moment
Cynthia drinks what she supposes to be her glass of plain soda.
As it is whiskey straight, she is seized with astonishment and
a fit of coughing. Sir Wilfrid relieves her of the glass.

Sir Wilfrid. [Indicating the contents of the glass.] I say, do
you ordinarily take it as high up&mdash;as seven fingers and two
thumbs.

Cynthia. [Coughing.] Jack poured it out. Just shows how
groggy he was! And now, Sir Wilfrid&mdash;


[She gets her things to go.


Sir Wilfrid. Oh, you can't go!


[Brooks appears at the door.


Cynthia. I am to be married at three.

Sir Wilfrid. Let him wait. [Aside to Brooks, whom he meets
near the door.] If Mr. Phillimore comes, bring his card up.

Brooks. [Going.] Yes, Sir Wilfrid.

Sir Wilfrid. To me!      [Tipping him.

Brooks. [Bowing.] To you, Sir Wilfrid. [Brooks goes.

Sir Wilfrid. [Returning to Cynthia.] I've got to have my
innings, y' know! [Looking at her more closely.] I say, you've
been crying!&mdash;

Cynthia. King William!

Sir Wilfrid. You are crying! Poor little gal!

Cynthia. [Tears in her eyes.] I feel all shaken and cold.


[Brooks returns with a card.


Sir Wilfrid. [Astonished and sympathetic.] Poor little gal.

Cynthia. [Her eyes wet.] I didn't sleep a wink last night.
[With disgust.] Oh, what is the matter with me?

Sir Wilfrid. Why, it's as plain as a pikestaff! You&mdash;
[Brooks has carried in the card to Sir Wilfred, who picks it up and
says aside, to Brooks:] Phillimore? [Brooks assents. Aloud to
Cynthia, calmly deceitful.] Who's Waldorf Smith? [Cynthia
shakes her head. To Brooks, returning card to salver.] Tell the
gentleman Mrs. Karslake is not here! [Brooks leaves the room.

Cynthia. [Aware that she has no business where she is.] I
thought it was Philip!

Sir Wilfrid. [Telling the truth as if it were a lie.] So did I!
[With cheerful confidence.] And now, Mrs. Karslake, I'll tell you[Pg 662]
why you're cryin'. [Sitting down beside her.] You're marryin' the
wrong man! I'm sorry for you, but you're such a goose. Here
you are, marryin' this legal luminary. What for? You don't
know! He don't know! But I do! You pretend you're marryin'
him because it's the sensible thing; not a bit of it. You're marryin'
Mr. Phillimore because of all the other men you ever saw
he's the least like Jack Karslake.

Cynthia. That's a very good reason.

Sir Wilfrid. There's only one good reason for marrying, and
that is because you'll die if you don't!

Cynthia. Oh, I've tried that!

Sir Wilfrid. The Scripture says: "Try! try! again!" I tell
you, there's nothing like a w'im!

Cynthia. What's that? W'im? Oh, you mean a whim! Do
please try and say Whim!

Sir Wilfrid. [For the first time emphasizing his H in the word.]
Whim. You must have a w'im&mdash;w'im for the chappie you
marry.

Cynthia. I had&mdash;for Jack.

Sir Wilfrid. Your w'im wasn't wimmy enough, my dear! If
you'd had more of it, and tougher, it would ha' stood, y'know!
Now, I'm not proposin'!

Cynthia. [Diverted at last from her own distress.] I hope not!

Sir Wilfrid. Oh, I will later! It's not time yet! As I was
saying&mdash;

Cynthia. And pray, Sir Wilfrid, when will it be time?

Sir Wilfrid. As soon as I see you have a w'im for me!
[Rising, looks at his watch.] And now, I'll tell you what we'll do!
We've got just an hour to get there in, my motor's on the corner,
and in fifty minutes we'll be at Belmont Park.

Cynthia. [Her sporting blood fired.] Belmont Park!

Sir Wilfrid. We'll do the races, and dine at Martin's&mdash;

Cynthia. [Tempted.] Oh, if I only could! I can't! I've got
to be married! You're awfully nice; I've almost got a "w'im"
for you already.

Sir Wilfrid. [Delighted.] There you are! I'll send a telegram!
[She shakes her head. He sits and writes at the table.

Cynthia. No, no, no!

Sir Wilfrid. [Reading what he has written.] "Off with Cates-Darby
to Races. Please postpone ceremony till seven-thirty."

Cynthia. Oh, no, it's impossible![Pg 663]

Sir Wilfrid. [Accustomed to have things go his way.] No more
than breathin'! You can't get a w'im for me, you know, unless
we're together, so together we'll be! [John Karslake opens the
door, and, unnoticed, walks into the room.] And to-morrow you'll
wake up with a jolly little w'im&mdash;, [Reading.] "Postpone
ceremony till seven-thirty." There. [He puts on her cloak and
turning, sees John.] Hello!

John. [Surly.] Hello! Sorry to disturb you.

Sir Wilfrid. [Cheerful as possible.] Just the man! [Giving
him the telegraph form.] Just step round and send it, my boy.
Thanks!      [John reads it.

Cynthia. No, no, I can't go!

Sir Wilfrid. Cockety-coo-coo-can't. I say, you must!

Cynthia. [Positively.] No!

John. [Astounded.] Do you mean you're going&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. [Very gay.] Off to the races, my boy!

John. [Angry and outraged.] Mrs. Karslake can't go with
you there!

Cynthia starts, amazed at his assumption of marital authority,
and delighted that she will have an opportunity of outraging his
sensibilities.

Sir Wilfrid. Oho!

John. An hour before her wedding!

Sir Wilfrid. [Gay and not angry.] May I know if it's the custom&mdash;

John. [Jealous and disgusted.] It's worse than eloping&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. Custom, y' know, for the husband, that was, to
dictate&mdash;

John. [Thoroughly vexed.] By George, there's a limit!

Cynthia. What? What? What? [Gathering up her things.]
What did I hear you say?

Sir Wilfrid. Ah!

John. [Angry.] I say there's a limit&mdash;

Cynthia. [More and more determined to arouse and excite
John.] Oh, there's a limit, is there?

John. There is! I bar the way! It means reputation&mdash;it
means&mdash;

Cynthia. [Enjoying her opportunity.] We shall see what it
means!

Sir Wilfrid. Aha![Pg 664]

John. [To Cynthia.] I'm here to protect your reputation&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. [To Cynthia.] We've got to make haste, you
know.

Cynthia. Now, I'm ready&mdash;

John. [To Cynthia.] Be sensible. You're breaking off the
match&mdash;

Cynthia. [Excitedly.] What's that to you?

Sir Wilfrid. It's boots and saddles!

John. [Taking his stand between them and the door.] No
thoroughfare!

Sir Wilfrid. Look here, my boy&mdash;!

Cynthia. [Catching at the opportunity of putting John in an
impossible position.] Wait a moment, Sir Wilfrid! Give me the
wire! [Facing him.] Thanks! [Taking the telegraph form from
him and tearing it up.] There! Too rude to chuck him by wire!
But you, Jack, you've taken on yourself to look after my interests,
so I'll just ask you, old man, to run down to the Supreme
Court and tell Philip&mdash;nicely, you know&mdash;I'm off with Sir Wilfrid
and where! Say I'll be back by seven, if I'm not later! And
make it clear, Jack, I'll marry him by eight-thirty or nine at the
latest! And mind you're there, dear! And now, Sir Wilfrid,
we're off.

John. [Staggered and furious, giving way as they pass him.]
I'm not the man to&mdash;to carry&mdash;

Cynthia. [Quick and dashing.] Oh, yes, you are.

John. &mdash;a message from you.

Cynthia. [Triumphant.] Oh, yes, you are; you're just
exactly the man!      [Cynthia and Sir Wilfrid whirl out.

John. Great miracles of Moses!



Curtain.





ACT III.


Scene. The same as that of Act I, but the room has been cleared of
superfluous furniture, and arranged for a wedding ceremony.
Mrs. Phillimore is reclining on the sofa at the right of the table,
Miss Heneage at its left. Sudley is seated at the right of the
table. Grace is seated on the sofa. There is a wedding-bell of
roses, an arch of orange blossoms, and, girdled by a ribbon of
white, an altar of calla lilies. There are cushions of flowers,[Pg 665]
alcoves of flowers, vases of flowers&mdash;in short, flowers everywhere
and in profusion and variety. Before the altar are two cushions
for the couple to kneel on and, on pedestals, at each side of the arch,
are twin candelabra. The hangings are pink and white.

The room, first of all, and its emblems, holds the undivided attention;
then slowly engaging it, and in contrast to their gay surroundings,
the occupants. About each and everyone of them, hangs a deadly
atmosphere of suppressed irritation.


Sudley. [Impatiently.] All very well, my dear Sarah. But
you see the hour. Twenty to ten! We have been here since half-past
two.

Miss Heneage. You had dinner?

Sudley. I did not come here at two to have dinner at eight,
and be kept waiting until ten! And, my dear Sarah, when I ask
where the bride is&mdash;

Miss Heneage. [With forced composure.] I have told you all
I know. Mr. John Karslake came to the house at lunch time,
spoke to Philip, and they left the house together.

Grace. Where is Philip?

Mrs. Phillimore. [Feebly, irritated.] I don't wish to be
censorious or to express an actual opinion, but I must say it's a
bold bride who keeps her future mother-in-law waiting for eight
hours. However, I will not venture to&mdash; [Mrs. Phillimore
reclines again and fades away into silence.

Grace. [Sharply and decisively.] I do! I'm sorry I went to
the expense of a silver ice-pitcher.

Mrs. Phillimore sighs. Miss Heneage keeps her temper with
an effort which is obvious. Thomas opens the door.

Sudley. [To Mrs. Phillimore.] For my part, I don't believe
Mrs. Karslake means to return here or to marry Philip at all!

Thomas. [Coming in, and approaching Miss Heneage.] Two
telegrams for you, ma'am! The choir boys have had their supper.
[A slight movement ripples the ominous calm of all. Thomas
steps back.

Sudley. [Rising.] At last we shall know!

Miss Heneage. From the lady! Probably!

Miss Heneage opens the first telegram and reads it at a glance,
laying it on the salver again with a look at Sudley. Thomas
passes the salver to Sudley, who takes the telegram.[Pg 666]

Grace. There's a toot now.

Mrs. Phillimore. [Feebly, confused.] I don't wish to intrude,
but really I cannot imagine Philip marrying at midnight. [As
Sudley reads, Miss Heneage opens the second telegram, but does
not read it.

Sudley. [Reading.] "Accident, auto struck"&mdash;something!
"Gasoline"&mdash;did something&mdash;illegible, ah! [Reads.] "Home by
nine forty-five! Hold the church!"


[A general movement sets in.


Miss Heneage. [Profoundly shocked.] "Hold the church!"
William, she still means to marry Philip! and to-night, too!

Sudley. It's from Belmont Park.

Grace. [Making a great discovery.] She went to the
races!

Miss Heneage. This is from Philip! [Reading the second telegram.]
"I arrive at ten o'clock. Have dinner ready." [Miss
Heneage motions to Thomas, who, obeying, retires. Looking at
her watch.] They are both due now. [Movement.] What's to be
done?      [She rises and Sudley shrugs his shoulders.

Sudley. [Rising.] After a young woman has spent her
wedding day at the races? Why, I consider that she has broken
the engagement,&mdash;and when she comes, tell her so.

Miss Heneage. I'll telephone Matthew. The choir boys can
go home&mdash;her maid can pack her belongings&mdash;and when the lady
arrives&mdash;

Impudently, the very distant toot of an auto-horn breaks in upon
her words, producing, in proportion to its growing nearness, an
increasing pitch of excitement and indignation. Grace flies to
the door and looks out. Mrs. Phillimore, helpless, does not
know what to do or where to go or what to say. Sudley moves
about excitedly. Miss Heneage stands ready to make herself
disagreeable.

Grace. [Speaking rapidly and with excitement.] I hear a man's
voice. Cates-Darby and brother Matthew.

A loud and brazenly insistent toot outrages afresh. Laughter and
voices outside are heard faintly. Grace looks out of the door, and,
as quickly withdraws.

Miss Heneage. Outrageous!

Sudley. Disgraceful![Pg 667]

Mrs. Phillimore. Shocking! [Partly rising as the voices and
horn are heard.] I shall not take any part at all, in the&mdash;eh&mdash;


[She fades away.


Miss Heneage. [Interrupting her.] Don't trouble yourself.

Through the growing noise of voices and laughter, Cynthia's voice
is heard. Sir Wilfrid is seen in the outer hall. He is burdened
with wraps, not to mention a newspaper and parasol, which in
no wise check his flow of gay remarks to Cynthia, who is still
outside. Cynthia's voice, and now Matthew's, reach those
inside, and, at last, both join Sir Wilfrid, who has turned at the
door to wait for them. As she reaches the door, Cynthia turns
and speaks to Matthew, who immediately follows her. She is in
automobile attire, wearing goggles, a veil, and an exquisite duster
of latest Paris style. They come in with a subdued bustle and
noise. As their eyes light on Cynthia, Sudley and Miss
Heneage exclaim, and there is a general movement.

Sudley. 'Pon my word!

Grace. Hah!

Miss Heneage. [Bristling up to her feet, her sensibilities outraged.]
Shocking!

Grace remains standing above sofa. Sudley moves toward her,
Miss Heneage sitting down again. Mrs. Phillimore reclines
on sofa. Cynthia begins to speak as soon as she appears and
speaks fluently to the end.

Cynthia. No! I never was so surprised in my life, as when I
strolled into the paddock and they gave me a rousing reception&mdash;old
Jimmy Withers, Debt Gollup, Jack Deal, Monty Spiffles, the
Governor and Buckeye. All of my old admirers! They simply
fell on my neck, and, dear Matthew, what do you think I did? I
turned on the water main! [There are movements and murmurs of
disapprobation from the family. Matthew indicates a desire to go.]
Oh, but you can't go!

Matthew. I'll return in no time!

Cynthia. I'm all ready to be married. Are they ready?
[Matthew waves a pious, polite gesture of recognition to the family.]
I beg everybody's pardon! [Taking off her wrap and putting
it on the back of a chair.] My goggles are so dusty, I can't see
who's who! [To Sir Wilfrid.] Thanks! You have carried it
well!      [She takes the parasol from Sir Wilfrid.[Pg 668]

Sir Wilfrid. [Aside to Cynthia.] When may I&mdash;?

Cynthia. See you next Goodwood!

Sir Wilfrid. [Imperturbably.] Oh, I'm coming back!

Cynthia. [Advancing a bit toward the family.] Not a bit of use
in coming back! I shall be married before you get here! Ta!
Ta! Goodwood!

Sir Wilfrid. [Not in the least affected.] I'm coming back.
[He goes out quickly. There are more murmurs of disapprobation
from the family. There is a slight pause.

Cynthia. [Beginning to take off her goggles, and moving nearer
"the family."] I do awfully apologize for being so late!

Miss Heneage. [Importantly.] Mrs. Karslake&mdash;

Sudley. [Importantly.] Ahem! [Cynthia lays down goggles,
and sees their severity.

Cynthia. Dear me! [Surveying the flowers and for a moment
speechless.] Oh, good heavens! Why, it looks like a smart
funeral!

Miss Heneage moves; then speaks in a perfectly ordinary natural
tone, but her expression is severe. Cynthia immediately realizes
the state of affairs in its fullness.

Miss Heneage. [To Cynthia.] After what has occurred,
Mrs. Karslake&mdash;

Cynthia. [Glances quietly toward the table, and then sits down
at it, composed and good-tempered.] I see you got my wire&mdash;so you
know where I have been.

Miss Heneage. To the race-course!

Sudley. With a rowdy Englishman. [Cynthia glances at
Sudley, uncertain whether he means to be disagreeable, or whether
he is only naturally so.

Miss Heneage. We concluded you desired to break the
engagement!

Cynthia. [Indifferently.] No! No! Oh! No!

Miss Heneage. Do you intend, despite of our opinion of
you&mdash;

Cynthia. The only opinion that would have any weight with
me would be Mrs. Phillimore's.


[She turns expectantly to Mrs. Phillimore.


Mrs. Phillimore. I am generally asleep at this hour, and,
accordingly, I will not venture to express any&mdash;eh&mdash;any&mdash;actual
opinion.      [She fades away. Cynthia smiles.[Pg 669]

Miss Heneage. [Coldly.] You smile. We simply inform you
that as regards us, the alliance is not grateful.

Cynthia. [Affecting gaiety and unconcern.] And all this
because the gasoline gave out.

Sudley. My patience has given out!

Grace. So has mine. I'm going.


[She makes good her word.


Sudley. [Vexed beyond civility. To Cynthia.] My dear
young lady: You come here, to this sacred&mdash;eh&mdash;eh&mdash;spot&mdash;altar!&mdash; [Gesture.]
odoriferous of the paddock!&mdash;speaking of
Spiffles and Buckeye,&mdash;having practically eloped!&mdash;having
created a scandal, and disgraced our family!

Cynthia. [Affecting surprise at this attitude.] How does it disgrace
you? Because I like to see a high-bred, clean, nervy, sweet
little four-legged gee play the antelope over a hurdle!

Miss Heneage. Sister, it is high time that you&mdash;

[She turns to Cynthia with a gesture.


Cynthia. [With quiet irony.] Mrs. Phillimore is generally
asleep at this hour, and accordingly she will not venture to
express&mdash;

Sudley. [Spluttering with irritation.] Enough, madam&mdash;I
venture to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;to say, you are leading a fast life.

Cynthia. [With powerful intention.] Not in this house! For
six heavy weeks have I been laid away in the grave, and I've
found it very slow indeed trying to keep pace with the dead!

Sudley. [Despairingly.] This comes of horses!

Cynthia. [Indignant.] Of what?

Sudley. C-c-caring for horses!

Miss Heneage. [With sublime morality.] What Mrs. Karslake
cares for is&mdash;men.

Cynthia. [Angry and gay.] What would you have me care
for? The Ornithorhyncus Paradoxus? or Pithacanthropus
Erectus? Oh, I refuse to take you seriously. [Sudley begins to
prepare to leave; he buttons himself into respectability and his coat.

Sudley. My dear madam, I take myself seriously&mdash;and
madam, I&mdash;I retract what I have brought with me [Feeling in his
waistcoat pocket.] as a graceful gift,&mdash;an Egyptian scarab&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;sacred
beetle, which once ornamented the person of a&mdash;eh&mdash;mummy.

Cynthia. [Scoring in return.] It should never be absent from
your pocket, Mr. Sudley!      [Sudley walks away in a rage.[Pg 670]

Miss Heneage. [Rising, to Sudley.] I've a vast mind to
withdraw my&mdash;      [Cynthia moves.

Cynthia. [Interrupts; maliciously.] Your wedding present?
The little bronze cat!

Miss Heneage. [Moves, angrily.] Oh! [Even Mrs. Phillimore
comes momentarily to life, and expresses silent indignation.

Sudley. [Loftily.] Sarah, I'm going.

Grace, who has met Philip, takes occasion to accompany him into
the room. Philip looks dusty and grim. As they come in,
Grace speaks to him, and Philip shakes his head. They pause
near the door.

Cynthia. [Emotionally.] I shall go to my room! However,
all I ask is that you repeat to Philip&mdash; [As she moves toward the
door, she comes suddenly upon Philip, and speaks to him in a low
voice.

Sudley. [To Miss Heneage, determined to win.] As I go out,
I shall do myself the pleasure of calling a hansom for Mrs.
Karslake&mdash;      [Philip moves slightly from the door.

Philip. As you go out, Sudley, have a hansom called, and
when it comes, get into it.

Sudley. [Furious.] Eh,&mdash;eh,&mdash;my dear sir, I leave you to
your fate. [Philip angrily points him the door and Sudley leaves in great haste.

Miss Heneage. [With weight.] Philip, you've not heard&mdash;

Philip. [Interrupting.] Everything&mdash;from Grace! My sister
has repeated your words to me&mdash;and her own! I've told her
what I think of her.      [Philip looks witheringly at Grace.

Grace. I shan't wait to hear any more.


[She flounces out of the room.


Philip. Don't make it necessary for me to tell you what I
think of you. [Philip moves to the right, toward his mother, to whom
he gives his arm. Miss Heneage immediately seeks the opposite
side.] Mother, with your permission, I desire to be alone. I
expect both you and Grace, Sarah, to be dressed and ready for
the ceremony a half hour from now. [As Philip and Mrs. Phillimore
are about to go out, Miss Heneage speaks.

Miss Heneage. I shall come or not as I see fit. And let me
add, my dear brother, that a fool at forty is a fool indeed. [Miss
Heneage, high and mighty, goes out, much pleased with her quotation.[Pg 671]

Mrs. Phillimore. [Stupid and weary as usual, to Philip, as
he leads her to the door.] My dear son&mdash;I won't venture to
express&mdash;      [Cynthia, in irritation, moves to the table.

Philip. [Soothing a silly mother.] No, mother, don't! But I
shall expect you, of course, at the ceremony. [Mrs. Phillimore
languidly retires. Philip strides to the centre of the room, taking the
tone, and assuming the attitude of, the injured husband.] It is
proper for me to tell you that I followed you to Belmont. I am
aware&mdash;I know with whom&mdash;in fact, I know all! [He punctuates
his words with pauses, and indicates the whole censorious universe.]
And now let me assure you&mdash;I am the last man in the world to
be jilted on the very eve of&mdash;of&mdash;everything with you. I won't
be jilted. [Cynthia is silent.] You understand? I propose to
marry you. I won't be made ridiculous.

Cynthia. [Glancing at Philip.] Philip, I didn't mean to
make you&mdash;

Philip. Why, then, did you run off to Belmont Park with
that fellow?

Cynthia. Philip, I&mdash;eh&mdash;

Philip. [Sitting down at the table.] What motive? What
reason? On our wedding day? Why did you do it?

Cynthia. I'll tell you the truth. I was bored.

Philip. [Staggered.] Bored? In my company?

Cynthia. I was bored, and then&mdash;and besides, Sir Wilfrid
asked me to go.

Philip. Exactly, and that was why you went. Cynthia, when
you promised to marry me, you told me you had forever done
with love. You agreed that marriage was the rational coming
together of two people.

Cynthia. I know, I know!

Philip. Do you believe that now?

Cynthia. I don't know what I believe. My brain is in a
whirl! But, Philip, I am beginning to be&mdash;I'm afraid&mdash;yes, I am
afraid that one can't just select a great and good man [Indicating
him.] and say: I will be happy with him.

Philip. [With complacent dignity.] I don't see why not. You
must assuredly do one or the other: You must either let your
heart choose or your head select.

Cynthia. [Gravely.] No, there's a third scheme: Sir Wilfrid
explained the theory to me. A woman should marry whenever[Pg 672]
she has a whim for the man, and then leave the rest to the man.
Do you see?

Philip. [Furious.] Do I see? Have I ever seen any thing else?
Marry for whim! That's the New York idea of marriage.

Cynthia. [Observing cynically.] New York ought to
know.

Philip. Marry for whim and leave the rest to the divorce
court! Marry for whim and leave the rest to the man. That was
the former Mrs. Phillimore's idea. Only she spelled "whim"
differently; she omitted the "w." [He rises in his anger.] And
now you&mdash;you take up with this preposterous&mdash; [Cynthia
moves uneasily.] But, nonsense! It's impossible! A woman of
your mental calibre&mdash;No. Some obscure, primitive, female
feeling is at work corrupting your better judgment! What is it
you feel?

Cynthia. Philip, you never felt like a fool, did you?

Philip. No, never.

Cynthia. [Politely.] I thought not.

Philip. No, but whatever your feelings, I conclude you are
ready to marry me.

Cynthia. [Uneasy.] Of course, I came back. I am here, am
I not?

Philip. You are ready to marry me?

Cynthia. [Twisting in the coils.] But you haven't had your
dinner.

Philip. Do I understand you refuse?

Cynthia. Couldn't we defer&mdash;?

Philip. You refuse?

Cynthia. [Desperately thinking of an escape from her promise,
and finding none.] No, I said I'd marry you. I'm a woman of my
word. I will.

Philip. [Triumphant.] Ah! Very good, then. Run to your
room. [Cynthia turns to Philip.] Throw something over you.
In a half hour I'll expect you here! And Cynthia, my dear,
remember! I cannot cuculate like a wood-pigeon, but&mdash;I esteem
you!

Cynthia. [Hopelessly.] I think I'll go, Philip.

Philip. I may not be fitted to play the love-bird, but&mdash;

Cynthia. [Spiritlessly.] I think I'll go, Philip.

Philip. I'll expect you,&mdash;in half an hour.

Cynthia. [With leaden despair.] Yes.[Pg 673]

Philip. And, Cynthia, don't think any more about that fellow,
Cates-Darby.

Cynthia. [Amazed and disgusted by his misapprehension.]
No. [As Cynthia leaves, Thomas comes in from the opposite door.

Philip. [Not seeing Thomas, and clumsily defiant.] And if I
had that fellow, Cates-Darby, in the dock&mdash;!

Thomas. Sir Wilfrid Cates-Darby.

Philip. Sir what&mdash;what&mdash;wh-who? [Sir Wilfrid enters in
evening dress. Philip looks Sir Wilfrid in the face and speaks to
Thomas.] Tell Sir Wilfrid Cates-Darby I am not at home to
him.      [Thomas is embarrassed.

Sir Wilfrid. [Undaunted.] My dear Lord Eldon&mdash;

Philip. [Again addressing Thomas.] Show the gentleman the
door. [There is a pause. Sir Wilfrid, with a significant gesture,
glances at the door.

Sir Wilfrid. [Moving to the door, he examines it and returns to
Philip.] Eh,&mdash;I admire the door, my boy! Fine, old carved
mahogany panel; but don't ask me to leave by it, for Mrs.
Karslake made me promise I'd come, and that's why I'm here.


[Thomas does not wait for further orders.


Philip. Sir, you are&mdash;impudent&mdash;!

Sir Wilfrid. [Interrupting.] Ah, you put it all in a nutshell,
don't you?

Philip. To show your face here, after practically eloping with
my wife!

Sir Wilfrid. [Affecting ignorance.] When were you married?

Philip. We are as good as married.

Sir Wilfrid. Oh, pooh, pooh! You can't tell me that grace
before soup is as good as a dinner! [He takes out his cigar-case
and, in the absence of a match, enjoys a smokeless smoke.

Philip. Sir&mdash;I&mdash;demand&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. [Calmly carrying the situation.] Mrs. Karslake
is not married. That's why I'm here. I am here for the same
purpose you are; to ask Mrs. Karslake to be my wife.

Philip. Are you in your senses?

Sir Wilfrid. [Pricking his American cousin's pet vanity.]
Come, come, Judge&mdash;you Americans have no sense of humour.
[Taking a small jewel-case from his pocket.] There's my regards for
the lady&mdash;and [Reasonably.], if I must go, I will. Of course, I
would like to see her, but&mdash;if it isn't your American custom&mdash;

Thomas. [Opens the door and announces.] Mr. Karslake.[Pg 674]

Sir Wilfrid. Oh, well, I say; if he can come, I can!

John Karslake, in evening dress, comes in quickly, carrying a
large and very smart bride's bouquet, which he hands to Philip,
who stands transfixed. Because it never occurs to him to refuse it
or chuck it away, Philip accepts the bouquet gingerly, but frees
himself of it at the first available moment. John walks to the
centre of the room. Deep down he is feeling wounded and unhappy.
But, as he knows his coming to the ceremony on whatever
pretext is a social outrage, he carries it off by assuming an air of
its being the most natural thing in the world. He controls the
expression of his deeper emotion, but the pressure of this keeps his
face grave, and he speaks with effort.

John. My compliments to the bride, Judge.

Philip. [Angry.] And you, too, have the effrontery?

Sir Wilfrid. There you are!

John. [Pretending ease.] Oh, call it friendship&mdash;


[Thomas leaves.


Philip. [Puts bouquet on table. Ironically.] I suppose Mrs.
Karslake&mdash;

John. She wagered me I wouldn't give her away, and of
course&mdash;

Throughout his stay John hides the emotions he will not show behind
a daring irony. Under its effects, Philip, on his right, walks about
in a fury. Sir Wilfrid, sitting down on the edge of the table, is
gay and undisturbed.

Philip. [Taking a step toward John.] You will oblige me&mdash;both
of you&mdash;by immediately leaving&mdash;

John. [Smiling and going to Philip.] Oh, come, come, Judge&mdash;suppose
I am here? Who has a better right to attend his wife's
obsequies! Certainly, I come as a mourner&mdash;for you!

Sir Wilfrid. I say, is it the custom?

John. No, no&mdash;of course it's not the custom, no. But we'll
make it the custom. After all,&mdash;what's a divorced wife among
friends?

Philip. Sir, your humour is strained!

John. Humour,&mdash;Judge?

Philip. It is, sir, and I'll not be bantered! Your both being
here is&mdash;it is&mdash;gentlemen, there is a decorum which the stars in
their courses do not violate.[Pg 675]

John. Now, Judge, never you mind what the stars do in their
divorces! Get down to earth of the present day. Rufus Choate
and Daniel Webster are dead. You must be modern. You must
let peroration and poetry alone! Come along now. Why
shouldn't I give the lady away?

Sir Wilfrid. Hear! Hear! Oh, I beg your pardon!

John. And why shouldn't we both be here? American marriage
is a new thing. We've got to strike the pace, and the only
trouble is, Judge, that the judiciary have so messed the thing up
that a man can't be sure he is married until he's divorced. It's a
sort of marry-go-round, to be sure! But let it go at that! Here
we all are, and we're ready to marry my wife to you, and start
her on her way to him!

Philip. [Brought to a standstill.] Good Lord! Sir, you cannot
trifle with monogamy!

John. Now, now, Judge, monogamy is just as extinct as knee-breeches.
The new woman has a new idea, and the new idea is&mdash;well,
it's just the opposite of the old Mormon one. Their idea is
one man, ten wives and a hundred children. Our idea is one
woman, a hundred husbands and one child.

Philip. Sir, this is polyandry.

John. Polyandry? A hundred to one it's polyandry; and
that's it, Judge! Uncle Sam has established consecutive polyandry,&mdash;but
there's got to be an interval between husbands! The
fact is, Judge, the modern American marriage is like a wire fence.
The woman's the wire&mdash;the posts are the husbands. [He indicates
himself, and then Sir Wilfrid and Philip.] One&mdash;two&mdash;three!
And if you cast your eye over the future you can count
them, post after post, up hill, down dale, all the way to Dakota!

Philip. All very amusing, sir, but the fact remains&mdash;

John. [Going to Philip who at once moves away.] Now, now,
Judge, I like you. But you're asleep; you're living in the dark
ages. You want to call up Central. "Hello, Central! Give me
the present time, 1906, New York!"

Sir Wilfrid. Of course you do, and&mdash;there you are!

Philip. [Heavily.] There I am not, sir! And&mdash; [To John.] as
for Mr. Karslake's ill-timed jocosity,&mdash;sir, in the future&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. Oh, hang the future!

Philip. I begin to hope, Sir Wilfrid, that in the future I shall
have the pleasure of hanging you! [To John.] And as to you,
sir, your insensate idea of giving away your own&mdash;your former&mdash;my&mdash;your&mdash;oh![Pg 676]
Good Lord! This is a nightmare! [He turns to
go in despair. Matthew, coming in, meets him, and stops him at
the door.

Matthew. [To Philip.] My dear brother, Aunt Sarah
Heneage refuses to give Mrs. Karslake away, unless you yourself,&mdash;eh&mdash;

Philip. [As he goes out.] No more! I'll attend to the matter!
[The Choir Boys are heard practising in the next room.

Matthew. [Mopping his brow.] How do you both do? My
aunt has made me very warm. [Ringing the bell.] You hear our
choir practising&mdash;sweet angel boys! H'm! H'm! Some of the
family will not be present. I am very fond of you, Mr. Karslake,
and I think it admirably Christian of you to have waived
your&mdash;eh&mdash;your&mdash;eh&mdash;that is, now that I look at it more narrowly, let
me say, that in the excitement of pleasurable anticipation, I forgot,
Karslake, that your presence might occasion remark&mdash; [Thomas
responds to his ring.] Thomas! I left, in the hall, a
small hand-bag or satchel containing my surplice.

Thomas. Yes, sir. Ahem!

Matthew. You must really find the hand-bag at once.


[Thomas turns to go, when he stops startled.


Thomas. Yes, sir. [Announcing in consternation.] Mrs. Vida
Phillimore. [Vida Phillimore, in full evening dress, steps gently
up to Matthew.

Matthew. [Always piously serene.] Ah, my dear child! Now
this is just as it should be! That is, eh&mdash; [He walks to the centre
of the room with her, Vida, the while, pointedly disregarding Sir
Wilfrid.] That is, when I come to think of it&mdash;your presence
might be deemed inauspicious.

Vida. But, my dear Matthew,&mdash;I had to come. [Aside to him.]
I have a reason for being here.


[Thomas, who has left the room, again appears.


Matthew. [With a helpless gesture.] But, my dear child&mdash;

Thomas. [With sympathetic intention.] Sir, Mr. Phillimore
wishes to have your assistance, sir&mdash;with Miss Heneage immediately!

Matthew. Ah! [To Vida.] One moment! I'll return. [To
Thomas.] Have you found the bag with my surplice?

He goes out with Thomas, speaking. Sir Wilfrid moves at
once to Vida. John, moving to a better position, watches
the door.[Pg 677]

Sir Wilfrid. [To Vida.] You're just the person I most want
to see!

Vida. [With affected iciness.] Oh, no, Sir Wilfrid, Cynthia
isn't here yet! [She moves to the table, and John, his eyes on the
door, coming toward her, she speaks to him with obvious sweetness.]
Jack, dear, I never was so ravished to see any one.

Sir Wilfrid. [Taken aback.] By Jove!

Vida. [Very sweet.] I knew I should find you here!

John. [Annoyed but civil.] Now don't do that!

Vida. [Sweeter than ever.] Jack!      [They sit down.

John. [Civil but plain spoken.] Don't do it!

Vida. [In a voice dripping with honey.] Do what, Jack?

John. Touch me with your voice! I have troubles enough of
my own.      [He sits not far from her; the table between them.

Vida. And I know who your troubles are! Cynthia!

[From this moment Vida abandons John as an object of the chase
and works him into her other game.

John. I hate her. I don't know why I came.

Vida. You came, dear, because you couldn't stay away&mdash;you're
in love with her.

John. All right, Vida, what I feel may be love&mdash;but all I can
say is, if I could get even with Cynthia Karslake&mdash;

Vida. You can, dear&mdash;it's as easy as powdering one's face;
all you have to do is to be too nice to me!

John. [Looking at her inquiringly.] Eh!

Vida. Don't you realize she's jealous of you? Why did she
come to my house this morning? She's jealous&mdash;and all you
have to do&mdash;

John. If I can make her wince, I'll make love to you till the
Heavenly cows come home!

Vida. Well, you see, my dear, if you make love to me it will
[Delicately indicating Sir Wilfrid.] cut both ways at once!

John. Eh,&mdash;what! Not Cates-Darby? [Starting.] Is that
Cynthia?

Vida. Now don't get rattled and forget to make love to me.

John. I've got the jumps. [Trying to follow her instructions.]
Vida, I adore you.

Vida. Oh, you must be more convincing; that won't do at all.

John. [Listening.] Is that she now?


[Matthew comes in and passes to the inner room.
[Pg 678]

Vida. It's Matthew. And, Jack, dear, you'd best get the
hang of it before Cynthia comes. You might tell me all about
your divorce. That's a sympathetic subject. Were you able to
undermine it?

John. No. I've got a wire from my lawyer this morning.
The divorce holds. She's a free woman. She can marry whom
she likes. [The organ is heard, very softly played.] Is that
Cynthia?      [He rises quickly.

Vida. It's the organ!

John. [Overwhelmingly excited.] By George! I should never
have come! I think I'll go.


[He makes a movement toward the door.


Vida. [Rises and follows him remonstratingly.] When I need
you?

John. I can't stand it.

Vida. Oh, but, Jack&mdash;

John. Good-night!

Vida. I feel quite ill. [Seeing that she must play her last card
to keep him, pretends to faintness; sways and falls into his arms.]
Oh!

John. [In a rage, but beaten.] I believe you're putting up a
fake.

The organ swells as Cynthia enters sweepingly, dressed in full
evening dress for the wedding ceremony. John, not knowing what
to do, keeps his arms about Vida as a horrid necessity.

Cynthia. [Speaking as she comes in, to Matthew.] Here I
am. Ridiculous to make it a conventional thing, you know.
Come in on the swell of the music, and all that, just as if I'd never
been married before. Where's Philip? [She looks for Philip and
sees John with Vida in his arms. She stops short.

John. [Uneasy and embarrassed.] A glass of water! I beg
your pardon, Mrs. Karslake&mdash;      [The organ plays on.

Cynthia. [Ironical and calm.] Vida!

John. She has fainted.

Cynthia. [Cynically.] Fainted? [Without pausing.] Dear,
dear, dear, terrible! So she has. [Sir Wilfrid takes the flowers
from a vase and prepares to sprinkle Vida's forehead with the water
it contains.] No, no, not her forehead, Sir Wilfrid, her frock!
Sprinkle her best Paquin! If it's a real faint, she will not
come to![Pg 679]

Vida. [Coming quickly to her senses as her Paris importation is
about to suffer.] I almost fainted.

Cynthia. Almost!

Vida. [Using the stock phrase as a matter of course, and reviving
rapidly.] Where am I? [John glances at Cynthia sharply.] Oh,
the bride! I beg every one's pardon. Cynthia, at a crisis like this,
I simply couldn't stay away from Philip!

Cynthia. Stay away from Philip?      [John and Cynthia exchange glances.

Vida. Your arm, Jack; and lead me where there is air.

John and Vida go into the further room. The organ stops. Sir
Wilfrid and Cynthia are practically alone in the room. John
and Vida are barely within sight. He is first seen to take her
fan and give her air; then to pick up a book and read to her.

Sir Wilfrid. I've come back.

Cynthia. [To Sir Wilfrid.] Asks for air and goes to the
greenhouse. [Cynthia crosses the room and Sir Wilfrid offers
her a seat.] I know why you are here. It's that intoxicating
little whim you suppose me to have for you. My regrets! But
the whim's gone flat! Yes, yes, my gasoline days are over. I'm
going to be garaged for good. However, I'm glad you're here;
you take the edge off&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. Mr. Phillimore?

Cynthia. [Sharply.] No, Karslake. I'm just waiting to say
the words [Thomas comes in unnoticed.] "love, honour and obey"
to Phillimore&mdash; [Looking back.] and at Karslake! [Seeing Thomas.]
What is it? Mr. Phillimore?

Thomas. Mr. Phillimore will be down in a few minutes, ma'am.
He's very sorry, ma'am [Lowering his voice and coming nearer to
Cynthia, mindful of the respectabilities], but there's a button off
his waistcoat.

Cynthia. [Rising. With irony.] Button off his waistcoat!


[Thomas goes out.


Sir Wilfrid. [Delightedly.] Ah! So much the better for me.
[Cynthia looks into the other room.] Now, then, never mind those
two! [Cynthia moves restlessly.] Sit down.

Cynthia. I can't.

Sir Wilfrid. You're as nervous as&mdash;

Cynthia. Nervous! Of course I'm nervous! So would you be
nervous if you'd had a runaway and smash up, and you were[Pg 680]
going to try it again. [She is unable to take her eyes from Vida and
John, and Sir Wilfrid, noting this, grows uneasy.] And if some
one doesn't do away with those calla lilies&mdash;the odor makes me
faint! [Sir Wilfrid moves.] No, it's not the lilies! It's the
orange blossoms!

Sir Wilfrid. Orange blossoms.

Cynthia. The flowers that grow on the tree that hangs over
the abyss! [Sir Wilfrid promptly confiscates the vase of orange
blossoms.] They smell of six o'clock in the evening. When
Philip's fallen asleep, and little boys are crying the winners outside,
and I'm crying inside, and dying inside and outside and
everywhere.

Sir Wilfrid. [Returning to her side.] Sorry to disappoint you.
They're artificial. [Cynthia shrugs her shoulders.] That's it!
They're emblematic of artificial domesticity! And I'm here to
help you balk it. [He sits down and Cynthia half rises and looks
toward John and Vida.] Keep still now, I've a lot to say to you.
Stop looking&mdash;

Cynthia. Do you think I can listen to you make love to me
when the man who&mdash;who&mdash;whom I most despise in all the world,
is reading poetry to the woman who&mdash;who got me into the fix
I'm in!

Sir Wilfrid. [Leaning over her chair.] What do you want to
look at 'em for? [Cynthia moves.] Let 'em be and listen to me!
Sit down; for damme, I'm determined.

Cynthia. [Now at the table and half to herself.] I won't look
at them! I won't think of them. Beasts! [Sir Wilfrid interposes
between her and her view of John. Thomas opens the door
and walks in.

Sir Wilfrid. Now, then&mdash;      [He sits down.

Cynthia. Those two here! It's just as if Adam and Eve
should invite the snake to their golden wedding. [Seeing Thomas.]
What is it, what's the matter?

Thomas. Mr. Phillimore's excuses, ma'am. In a very short
time&mdash;      [Thomas goes out.

Sir Wilfrid. I'm on to you! You hoped for more buttons!

Cynthia. I'm dying of the heat; fan me.


[Sir Wilfrid fans Cynthia.


Sir Wilfrid. Heat! No! You're dying because you're
ignorin' nature. Certainly you are! You're marryin' Phillimore!
[Cynthia appears faint.] Can't ignore nature, Mrs. Karslake.[Pg 681]
Yes, you are; you're forcin' your feelin's. [Cynthia glances at
him.] And what you want to do is to let yourself go a bit&mdash;up
anchor and sit tight! I'm no seaman, but that's the idea!
[Cynthia moves and shakes her head.] So just throw the reins on
nature's neck, jump this fellow Phillimore and marry me!


[He leans toward Cynthia.


Cynthia. [Naturally, but with irritation.] You propose to me
here, at a moment like this? When I'm on the last lap&mdash;just in
sight of the goal&mdash;the gallows&mdash;the halter&mdash;the altar, I don't
know what its name is! No, I won't have you! [Looking toward
Karslake and Vida.] And I won't have you stand near me! I
won't have you talking to me in a low tone! [Her eyes glued on
John and Vida.] Stand over there&mdash;stand where you are.

Sir Wilfrid. I say&mdash;

Cynthia. I can hear you&mdash;I'm listening!

Sir Wilfrid. Well, don't look so hurried and worried. You've
got buttons and buttons of time. And now my offer. You
haven't yet said you would&mdash;

Cynthia. Marry you? I don't even know you!

Sir Wilfrid. [Feeling sure of being accepted.] Oh,&mdash;tell you all
about myself. I'm no duke in a pickle o' debts, d'ye see? I can
marry where I like. Some o' my countrymen are rotters, ye know.
They'd marry a monkey, if poppa-up-the-tree had a corner in
cocoanuts! And they do marry some queer ones, y' know.
[Cynthia looks beyond him, exclaims and turns. Sir Wilfrid turns.

Cynthia. Do they?

Sir Wilfrid. Oh, rather. That's what's giving your heiresses
such a bad name lately. If a fellah's in debt he can't pick and
choose, and then he swears that American gals are awfully fine
lookers, but they're no good when it comes to continuin' the
race! Fair dolls in the drawin'-room, but no good in the nursery.

Cynthia. [Thinking of John and Vida and nothing else.] I can
see Vida in the nursery.

Sir Wilfrid. You understand when you want a brood mare,
you don't choose a Kentucky mule.

Cynthia. I think I see one.

Sir Wilfrid. Well, that's what they're saying over there.
They say your gals run to talk [He plainly remembers Vida's
volubility.] and I have seen gals here that would chat life into a[Pg 682]
wooden Indian! That's what you Americans call being clever.&mdash;All
brains and no stuffin'! In fact, some of your American gals
are the nicest boys I ever met.

Cynthia. So that's what you think?

Sir Wilfrid. Not a bit what I think&mdash;what my countrymen
think!

Cynthia. Why are you telling me?

Sir Wilfrid. Oh, just explaining my character. I'm the sort
that can pick and choose&mdash;and what I want is heart.

Cynthia. [Vida and John ever in mind.] No more heart than
a dragon-fly!      [The organ begins to play softly.

Sir Wilfrid. That's it, dragon-fly. Cold as stone and never
stops buzzing about and showin' off her colours. It's that American
dragon-fly girl that I'm afraid of, because, d'ye see, I don't
know what an American expects when he marries; yes, but
you're not listening!

Cynthia. I am listening. I am!

Sir Wilfrid. [Speaking directly to her.] An Englishman, ye
see, when he marries expects three things: love, obedience, and
five children.

Cynthia. Three things! I make it seven!

Sir Wilfrid. Yes, my dear, but the point is, will you be
mistress of Traynham?

Cynthia. [Who has only half listened to him.] No, Sir Wilfrid,
thank you, I won't. [She turns to see John walk across the
drawing-room with Vida, and apparently absorbed in what she is
saying.] It's outrageous!

Sir Wilfrid. Eh? Why you're cryin'?

Cynthia. [Almost sobbing.] I am not.

Sir Wilfrid. You're not crying because you're in love with
me?

Cynthia. I'm not crying&mdash;or if I am, I'm crying because I
love my country. It's a disgrace to America&mdash;cast-off husbands
and wives getting together in a parlour and playing tag under a
palm-tree. [John, with intention and determined to stab Cynthia,
kisses Vida's hand.

Sir Wilfrid. Eh! Oh! I'm damned! [To Cynthia.] What
do you think that means?

Cynthia. I don't doubt it means a wedding here, at once&mdash;after
mine! [Vida and John leave the drawing-room and walk
slowly toward them.[Pg 683]

Vida. [Affecting an impossible intimacy to wound Cynthia and
tantalize Sir Wilfrid.] Hush, Jack&mdash;I'd much rather no one
should know anything about it until it's all over!

Cynthia. [Starting and looking at Sir Wilfrid.] What did I
tell you?

Vida. [To Cynthia.] Oh, my dear, he's asked me to champagne
and lobster at your house&mdash;his house! Matthew is
coming! [Cynthia starts, but controls herself.] And you're to
come, Sir Wilfrid. [Intending to convey the idea of a sudden
marriage ceremony.] Of course, my dear, I would like to wait for your
wedding, but something rather&mdash;rather important to me is to
take place, and I know you'll excuse me.      [The organ stops.

Sir Wilfrid. [Piqued at being forgotten.] All very neat, but
you haven't given me a chance, even.

Vida. Chance? You're not serious?

Sir Wilfrid. I am!

Vida. [Striking while the iron is hot.] I'll give you a minute
to offer yourself.

Sir Wilfrid. Eh?

Vida. Sixty seconds from now.

Sir Wilfrid. [Uncertain.] There's such a thing as bein' silly.

Vida. [Calm and determined.] Fifty seconds left.

Sir Wilfrid. I take you&mdash;count fair. [He hands her his watch
and goes to where Cynthia stands.] I say, Mrs. Karslake&mdash;

Cynthia. [Overwhelmed with grief and emotion.] They're
engaged; they're going to be married to-night, over champagne
and lobster at my house!

Sir Wilfrid. Will you consider your&mdash;

Cynthia. [Hastily, to get rid of him.] No, no, no, no! Thank
you, Sir Wilfrid, I will not.

Sir Wilfrid. [Calm, and not to be laid low.] Thanks awfully.
[Cynthia walks away. Returning to Vida.] Mrs. Phillimore&mdash;

Vida. [Returning his watch.] Too late! [To Karslake.]
Jack, dear, we must be off.

Sir Wilfrid. [Standing and making a general appeal for information.]
I say, is it the custom for American girls&mdash;that sixty
seconds or too late? Look here! Not a bit too late. I'll take
you around to Jack Karslake's, and I'm going to ask you the
same old question again, you know. [To Vida.] By Jove, you
know in your country it's the pace that kills.


[Sir Wilfrid follows Vida out the door.
[Pg 684]

John. [Gravely to Cynthia, who has walked away.] Good-night,
Mrs. Karslake, I'm going; I'm sorry I came.

Cynthia. Sorry? Why are you sorry? [John looks at her;
she winces a little.] You've got what you wanted. [After a
pause.] I wouldn't mind your marrying Vida&mdash;

John. [Gravely.] Oh, wouldn't you?

Cynthia. But I don't think you showed good taste in engaging
yourselves here.

John. Of course, I should have preferred a garden of roses and
plenty of twilight.

Cynthia. [Rushing into speech.] I'll tell you what you have
done&mdash;you've thrown yourself away! A woman like that! No
head, no heart! All languor and loose&mdash;loose frocks&mdash;she's the
typical, worst thing America can do! She's the regular American
marriage worm!

John. I have known others&mdash;

Cynthia. [Quickly.] Not me. I'm not a patch on that
woman. Do you know anything about her life? Do you know
the things she did to Philip? Kept him up every night of his
life&mdash;forty days out of every thirty&mdash;and then, without his
knowing it, put brandy in his coffee to make him lively at
breakfast.

John. [Banteringly.] I begin to think she is just the
woman&mdash;

Cynthia. [Unable to quiet her jealousy.] She is not the woman
for you! A man with your bad temper&mdash;your airs of authority&mdash;your
assumption of&mdash;of&mdash;everything. What you need is a good,
old-fashioned, bread-poultice woman!


[Cynthia comes to a full stop and faces him.


John. [Sharply.] Can't say I've had any experience of the
good old-fashioned bread-poultice.

Cynthia. I don't care what you say! If you marry Vida
Phillimore&mdash;you sha'n't do it. [Tears of rage choking her.] No,
I liked your father and, for his sake, I'll see that his son doesn't
make a donkey of himself a second time.

John. [Too angry to be amused.] Oh, I thought I was divorced.
I begin to feel as if I had you on my hands still.

Cynthia. You have! You shall have! If you attempt to
marry her, I'll follow you&mdash;and I'll find her&mdash;I'll tell Vida&mdash; [He
turns to her.] I will. I'll tell Vida just what sort of a dance
you led me.[Pg 685]

John. [Quickly on her last word but speaking gravely.] Indeed!
Will you? And why do you care what happens to me?

Cynthia. [Startled by his tone.] I&mdash;I&mdash;ah&mdash;

John. [Insistently and with a faint hope.] Why do you
care?

Cynthia. I don't. Not in your sense&mdash;

John. How dare you then pretend&mdash;

Cynthia. I don't pretend.

John. [Interrupting her; proud, serious and strong.] How dare
you look me in the face with the eyes that I once kissed, and pretend
the least regard for me? [Cynthia recoils and looks away.
Her own feelings are revealed to her clearly for the first time.] I
begin to understand our American women now. Fire-flies&mdash;and
the fire they gleam with is so cold that a midge couldn't warm his
heart at it, let alone a man. You're not of the same race as a
man! You married me for nothing, divorced me for nothing,
because you are nothing!

Cynthia. [Wounded to the heart.] Jack! What are you
saying?

John. [With unrestrained emotion.] What,&mdash;you feigning an
interest in me, feigning a lie&mdash;and in five minutes&mdash; [With a
gesture, indicating the altar.] Oh, you've taught me the trick of
your sex&mdash;you're the woman who's not a woman!

Cynthia. [Weakly.] You're saying terrible things to me.

John. [Low and with intensity.] You haven't been divorced
from me long enough to forget&mdash;what you should be ashamed to
remember.

Cynthia. [Unable to face him and pretending not to understand
him.] I don't know what you mean?

John. [More forcibly and with manly emotion.] You're not
able to forget me! You know you're not able to forget me; ask
yourself if you are able to forget me, and when your heart, such
as it is, answers "no," then&mdash; [The organ is plainly heard.]
Well, then, prance gaily up to the altar and marry that, if you
can!

He abruptly quits the room and Cynthia, moving to an armchair,
sinks into it, trembling. Matthew comes in and is joined by
Miss Heneage and Philip. They do not see Cynthia buried
deeply in her chair. Accordingly, Miss Heneage moves over to
the sofa and waits. They are all dressed for an evening reception
and Philip is in the traditional bridegroom's rig.[Pg 686]

Matthew. [As he enters.] I am sure you will do your part,
Sarah&mdash;in a spirit of Christian decorum. [To Philip.] It was
impossible to find my surplice, Philip, but the more informal the
better.

Philip. [With pompous responsibility.] Where's Cynthia?


[Matthew gives a glance around the room.


Matthew. Ah, here's the choir! [He moves forward to meet it.
Choir Boys come in very orderly; divide and take their places, an
even number on each side of the altar of flowers. Matthew vaguely
superintends. Philip gets in the way of the bell and moves out of the
way. Thomas comes in.] Thomas, I directed you&mdash;One
moment, if you please. [He indicates the tables and chairs which
Thomas hastens to push against the wall.

Philip. [Walking forward and looking around him.] Where's
Cynthia? [Cynthia rises, and, at the movement, Philip sees her
and moves toward her. The organ grows suddenly silent.

Cynthia. [Faintly.] Here I am.


[Matthew comes down. Organ plays softly.


Matthew. [To Cynthia.] Ah, my very dear Cynthia, I knew
there was something. Let me tell you the words of the hymn I
have chosen:


"Enduring love; sweet end of strife!
Oh, bless this happy man and wife!"


I'm afraid you feel&mdash;eh&mdash;eh!

Cynthia. [Desperately calm.] I feel awfully queer&mdash;I think I
need a scotch.

Organ stops. Philip remains uneasily at a little distance. Mrs.
Phillimore and Grace enter back slowly, as cheerfully as if
they were going to hear the funeral service read. They remain
near the doorway.

Matthew. Really, my dear, in the pomp and vanity&mdash;I
mean&mdash;ceremony of this&mdash;this unique occasion, there should be
sufficient exhilaration.

Cynthia. [With extraordinary control.] But there isn't!


[Feeling weak, she sits down.


Matthew. I don't think my Bishop would approve of&mdash;eh&mdash;anything
before!

Cynthia. [Too agitated to know how much she is moved.] I feel very queer.[Pg 687]

Matthew. [Piously sure that everything is for the best.] My
dear child&mdash;

Cynthia. However, I suppose there's nothing for it&mdash;now&mdash;but&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;

Matthew. Courage!

Cynthia. [Desperate and with a sudden explosion.] Oh, don't
speak to me. I feel as if I'd been eating gunpowder, and the very
first word of the wedding service would set it off!

Matthew. My dear, your indisposition is the voice of nature.
[Cynthia speaks more rapidly and with growing excitement.
Matthew makes a movement toward the Choir Boys.

Cynthia. Ah,&mdash;that's it&mdash;nature! [Matthew shakes his
head.] I've a great mind to throw the reins on nature's
neck.

Philip. Matthew! [He moves to take his stand for the
ceremony.

Matthew. [Looks at Philip. To Cynthia.] Philip is ready.
[Philip comes forward and the organ plays the wedding
march.

Cynthia. [To herself, as if at bay.] Ready? Ready? Ready?

Matthew. Cynthia, you will take Miss Heneage's arm.
[Miss Heneage moves stiffly nearer to the table.] Sarah! [He
waves Miss Heneage in the direction of Cynthia, at which she
advances a joyless step or two. Matthew goes over to give the
choir a low direction.] Now please don't forget, my boys. When
I raise my hands so, you begin, "Enduring love, sweet end of
strife," etc. [Cynthia has risen. On the table by which she stands
is her long lace cloak. Matthew assumes sacerdotal importance
and takes his position inside the altar of flowers.] Ahem! Philip!
[He signs to Philip to take his position.] Sarah! [Cynthia
breathes fast, and supports herself against the table. Miss Heneage,
with the silent air of a martyr, goes toward her and stands for a
moment looking at her.] The ceremony will now begin.

The organ plays Mendelssohn's wedding march. Cynthia turns
and faces Miss Heneage. Miss Heneage slowly reaches
Cynthia and extends her hand in her readiness to lead the bride
to the altar.

Miss Heneage. Mrs. Karslake!

Philip. Ahem! [Matthew walks forward two or three steps.
Cynthia stands as if turned to stone.[Pg 688]

Matthew. My dear Cynthia. I request you&mdash;to take your
place. [Cynthia moves one or two steps as if to go up to the altar.
She takes Miss Heneage's hand and slowly they walk toward
Matthew.] Your husband to be&mdash;is ready, the ring is in my
pocket. I have only to ask you the&mdash;eh&mdash;necessary questions,&mdash;and&mdash;eh&mdash;all
will be blissfully over in a moment.


[The organ grows louder.


Cynthia. [At this moment, just as she reaches Philip, stops,
faces round, looks him, Matthew, and the rest in the face, and cries
out in despair.] Thomas! Call a hansom! [Thomas goes out,
leaving the door open. Miss Heneage crosses the room quickly;
Mrs. Phillimore, shocked into action, rises. Cynthia catches up
her cloak from the table. Philip turns and Cynthia comes forward
and stops.] I can't, Philip&mdash;I can't. [Whistle of hansom is heard
off; the organ stops.] It is simply a case of throwing the reins on
nature's neck&mdash;up anchor&mdash;and sit tight! [Matthew moves to
Cynthia.] Matthew, don't come near me! Yes, yes, I distrust
you. It's your business, and you'd marry me if you could.

Philip. [Watching her in dismay as she throws on her cloak.]
Where are you going?

Cynthia. I'm going to Jack.

Philip. What for?

Cynthia. To stop his marrying Vida. I'm blowing a hurricane
inside, a horrible, happy hurricane! I know myself&mdash;I
know what's the matter with me. If I married you and Miss
Heneage&mdash;what's the use of talking about it&mdash;he mustn't marry
that woman. He sha'n't. [Cynthia has now all her wraps on
and walks toward the door rapidly. To Philip.] Sorry! So long!
Good-night and see you later.

Reaching the door, she goes out in blind haste and without further
ceremony. Matthew, in absolute amazement, throws up his
arms. Philip is rigid. Mrs. Phillimore sinks into a chair.
Miss Heneage stands supercilious and unmoved. Grace, the
same. The choir, at Matthew's gesture, mistakes it for the concerted
signal, and bursts lustily into the Epithalamis:


"Enduring love&mdash;sweet end of strife!
Oh, bless this happy man and wife!"




Curtain.




[Pg 689]
ACT IV.


Scene. The scene is laid in John Karslake's study and smoking-room.
There is a bay window on the left. A door on the left leads
to stairs and the front of the house, while a door at the back leads
to the dining-room. A fireplace and a mantel are on the right. A
bookcase contains law and sporting books. On the wall is a full-length
portrait of Cynthia. Nothing of this portrait is seen by
audience except the gilt frame and a space of canvas. A large
table with writing materials is littered over with law books, sporting
books, papers, pipes, crops, a pair of spurs, &amp;c. A wedding ring
lies on it. There are three very low easy-chairs. The general
appearance of the room is extremely gay and garish in colour. It
has the easy confusion of a man's room. There is a small table
on which, lying open, is a woman's sewing-basket, and, beside it, a
piece of rich fancy work, as if a lady had just risen from sewing.
Laid on the further end of it are a lady's gloves. On a chair-back
is a lady's hat. It is a half hour later than the close of Act III.
Curtains are drawn over the window. A lamp on the table is
lighted, as are, too, the various electric lights. One chair is conspicuously
standing on its head.

Nogam is busy at the larger table. The door into the dining-room
is half open.

Sir Wilfrid. [Coming in from the dining-room.] Eh&mdash;what
did you say your name was?

Nogam. Nogam, sir.

Sir Wilfrid. Nogam? I've been here thirty minutes. Where
are the cigars? [Nogam motions to a small table near the entrance
door.] Thank you. Nogam, Mr. Karslake was to have followed
us here, immediately. [He lights a cigar.

Nogam. Mr. Karslake just now 'phoned from his club [Sir
Wilfrid walks toward the front of the room.], and he's on his way
home, sir.

Sir Wilfrid. Nogam, why is that chair upside down?

Nogam. Our orders, sir.

Vida. [Speaking as she comes in.] Oh, Wilfrid! [Sir Wilfrid
turns. Vida coming slowly toward him.] I can't be left longer
alone with the lobster! He reminds me too much of Phillimore!

Sir Wilfrid. Karslake's coming; stopped at his club on the
way! [To Nogam.] You haven't heard anything of Mrs. Karslake&mdash;?[Pg 690]

Nogam. [Surprised.] No, sir!

Sir Wilfrid. [In an aside to Vida, as they move right to appear
to be out of Nogam's hearing.] Deucedly odd, ye know&mdash;for the
Reverend Matthew declared she left Phillimore's house before
he did,&mdash;and she told them she was coming here!


[Nogam evidently takes this in.


Vida. Oh, she'll turn up.

Sir Wilfrid. Yes, but I don't see how the Reverend Phillimore
had the time to get here and make us man and wife, don't y' know&mdash;

Vida. Oh, Matthew had a fast horse and Cynthia a slow one&mdash;or
she's a woman and changed her mind! Perhaps she's gone
back and married Phillimore. And besides, dear, Matthew
wasn't in the house four minutes and a half; only just long
enough to hoop the hoop. [She twirls her new wedding ring gently
about her finger.] Wasn't it lucky he had a ring in his
pocket?

Sir Wilfrid. Rather.

Vida. And are you aware, dear, that Phillimore bought and
intended it for Cynthia? Do come [Going toward the door through
which she has just entered.], I'm desperately hungry! Whenever
I'm married that's the effect it has! [Vida goes out and Sir Wilfrid,
following, stops to talk to Nogam.

Sir Wilfrid. We'll give Mr. Karslake ten minutes, Nogam.
If he does not come then, you might serve supper.


[He joins Vida.


Nogam. [To Sir Wilfrid.] Yes, sir. [The outside door opens and Fiddler walks in.

Fiddler. [Easy and business-like.] Hello, Nogam, where's
the guv'nor? That mare's off her oats, and I've got to see him.

Nogam. He'll soon be here.

Fiddler. Who was the parson I met leaving the house?

Nogam. [Whispering.] Sir Wilfrid and Mrs. Phillimore have
a date with the guv'nor in the dining-room, and the reverend
gentleman&mdash; [He makes a gesture as of giving an ecclesiastical
blessing.

Fiddler. [Amazed.] He hasn't spliced them? [Nogam
assents.] He has? They're married? Never saw a parson could
resist it!

Nogam. Yes, but I've got another piece of news for you. Who
do you think the Rev. Phillimore expected to find here?[Pg 691]

Fiddler. [Proud of having the knowledge.] Mrs. Karslake? I
saw her headed this way in a hansom with a balky horse only a
minute ago. If she hoped to be in at the finish&mdash;


[Fiddler is about to set the chair on its legs.


Nogam. [Quickly.] Mr. Fiddler, sir, please to let it alone.

Fiddler. [Putting the chair down in surprise.] Does it live on
its blooming head?

Nogam. Don't you remember? She threw it on its head when
she left here, and he won't have it up. Ah, that's it&mdash;hat, sewing-basket
and all,&mdash;the whole rig is to remain as it was when she
handed him his knock-out.      [A bell rings outside.

Fiddler. There's the guv'nor&mdash;I hear him!

Nogam. I'll serve the supper. [Taking a letter from his pocket
and putting it on the mantel.] Mr. Fiddler, would you mind giving
this to the guv'nor? It's from his lawyer&mdash;his lawyer couldn't
find him and left it with me. He said it was very important.
[The bell rings again. Speaking from the door to Sir Wilfrid.]
I'm coming, sir!

Nogam goes out, shutting the door. John Karslake comes in.
His hat is pushed over his eyes; his hands are buried in his
pockets, and his appearance generally is one of weariness and
utter discouragement. He walks into the room slowly and heavily.
He sees Fiddler, who salutes, forgetting the letter. John
slowly sinks into the arm-chair near his study table.

John. [As he walks to his chair.] Hello, Fiddler! [After a
pause, John throws himself into a chair, keeping his hat on. He
throws down his gloves, sighing.

Fiddler. Came in to see you, sir, about Cynthia K.

John. [Drearily.] Damn Cynthia K!&mdash;

Fiddler. Couldn't have a word with you?

John. [Grumpy.] No!

Fiddler. Yes, sir.

John. Fiddler.

Fiddler. Yes, sir.

John. Mrs. Karslake&mdash; [Fiddler nods.] You used to say
she was our mascot?

Fiddler. Yes, sir.

John. Well, she's just married herself to a&mdash;a sort of a man&mdash;

Fiddler. Sorry to hear it, sir.

John. Well, Fiddler, between you and me, we're a pair of idiots.[Pg 692]

Fiddler. Yes, sir!

John. And now it's too late!

Fiddler. Yes, sir&mdash;oh, beg your pardon, sir&mdash;your lawyer
left a letter. [John takes letter; opens it and reads it, indifferently
at first.

John. [As he opens the letter.] What's he got to say, more than
what his wire said?&mdash;Eh&mdash; [Dumbfounded as he reads.] what?&mdash;Will
explain.&mdash;Error in wording of telegram.&mdash;Call me up.&mdash; [Turning
quickly to the telephone.] The man can't mean that she's
still&mdash;Hello! Hello!      [John listens.

Fiddler. Would like to have a word with you, sir&mdash;

John. Hello, Central!

Fiddler. That mare&mdash;

John. [Consulting the letter, and speaking into the 'phone.]
33246a 38! Did you get it?

Fiddler. That mare, sir, she's got a touch of malaria&mdash;

John. [At the 'phone.] Hello, Central&mdash;33246a&mdash;38!&mdash;Clayton
Osgood&mdash;yes, yes, and say, Central&mdash;get a move on you!

Fiddler. If you think well of it, sir, I'll give her a
tonic&mdash;

John. [Still at the 'phone.] Hello! Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;Jack Karslake.
Is that you, Clayton? Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;well&mdash;

Fiddler. Or if you like, sir, I'll give her&mdash;

John. [Turning on Fiddler.] Shut up! [To 'phone.] What
was that? Not you&mdash;not you&mdash;a technical error? You mean to
say that Mrs. Karslake is still&mdash;my&mdash;Hold the wire, Central&mdash;get
off the wire! Get off the wire! Is that you, Clayton?
Yes, yes&mdash;she and I are still&mdash;I got it! Good-bye! [He
hangs up the receiver; falls back into a chair. For a moment he is
overcome. He takes up telephone book.

Fiddler. All very well, Mr. Karslake, but I must know if I'm
to give her&mdash;

John. [Turning over the leaves of the telephone book in hot
haste.] What's Phillimore's number?

Fiddler. If you've no objections, I think I'll give her a&mdash;

John. L&mdash;M&mdash;N&mdash;O&mdash;P&mdash;It's too late! She's married
by this! Married!&mdash;and&mdash;my God&mdash;I&mdash;I am the cause. Phillimore&mdash;

Fiddler. I'll give her[Pg 693]&mdash;

John. Give her wheatina!&mdash;give her grape-nuts&mdash;give her
away! [Fiddler, biding his time, walks toward the window.]
Only be quiet! Phillimore!


[Sir Wilfrid comes in.


Sir Wilfrid. Hello! We'd almost given you up!

John. [In his agitation unable to find Phillimore's number.]
Just a moment! I'm trying to get Phillimore on the 'phone
to&mdash;to tell Mrs. Karslake&mdash;

Sir Wilfrid. No good, my boy&mdash;she's on her way here!
[John drops the book and looks up dumbfounded.] The Reverend
Matthew was here, y' see&mdash;and he said&mdash;

John. [Rising, turns.] Mrs. Karslake is coming here? [Sir
Wilfrid nods.] To this house? Here?

Sir Wilfrid. That's right.

John. Coming here? You're sure? [Sir Wilfrid nods assent.]
Fiddler, I want you to stay here, and if Mrs. Karslake
comes, don't fail to let me know! Now then, for heaven's
sake, what did Matthew say to you?

Sir Wilfrid. Come along in and I'll tell you.

John. On your life now, Fiddler, don't fail to let me&mdash;


[Sir Wilfrid carries John off with him.


Vida. [From the dining-room.] Ah, here you are!

Fiddler. Phew!

A moment's pause, and Cynthia opens the front door, and comes
in very quietly, almost shyly, as if she were uncertain of her welcome.

Cynthia. Fiddler! Where is he? Has he come? Is he
here? Has he gone?

Fiddler. [Rattled.] Nobody's gone, ma'am, except the Reverend
Matthew Phillimore.

Cynthia. Matthew? He's been here and gone? [Fiddler
nods assent.] You don't mean I'm too late? He's married
them already?

Fiddler. Nogam says he married them!

Cynthia. He's married them! Married! Married before I
could get here! [Sinking into an armchair.] Married in less
time than it takes to pray for rain! Oh, well, the church&mdash;the
church is a regular quick marriage counter. [Vida and John
are heard in light-hearted laughter.] Oh!

Fiddler. I'll tell Mr. Karslake[Pg 694]&mdash;

Cynthia. [Rising and going to the dining-room door,
turns the key in the lock and takes it out.] No&mdash;I wouldn't see
him for the world! [Moving to the work-table with the key.]
If I'm too late, I'm too late! and that's the end of it! [Laying
the key on the table, she remains standing near it.] I've come,
and now I'll go! [There is a long pause during which Cynthia
looks slowly about the room, then sighs and changes her tone.]
Well, Fiddler, it's all a good deal as it used to be in my day.

Fiddler. No, ma'am&mdash;everything changed, even the horses.

Cynthia. [Absent-mindedly.] Horses&mdash;how are the horses?

[Throughout her talk with Fiddler she gives the idea that she is
saying good-bye to her life with John.

Fiddler. Ah, when husband and wife splits, ma'am, it's
the horses that suffer. Oh, yes, ma'am, we're all changed since
you give us the go-by,&mdash;even the guv'nor.

Cynthia. How's he changed?

Fiddler. Lost his sharp for horses, and ladies, ma'am&mdash;gives
'em both the boiled eye.

Cynthia. I can't say I see any change; there's my portrait&mdash;I
suppose he sits and pulls faces at me.

Fiddler. Yes, ma'am, I think I'd better tell him of your bein' here.

Cynthia. [Gently but decidedly.] No, Fiddler, no! [Again
looking about her.] The room's in a terrible state of disorder.
However, your new mistress will attend to that. [Pause.] Why,
that's not her hat!

Fiddler. Yours, ma'am.

Cynthia. Mine? [Walking to the table to look at it.] Is that
my work-basket? [After a pause.] My gloves? [Fiddler
assents.] And I suppose&mdash; [Hurriedly going to the writing-table.]
My&mdash;yes, there it is: my wedding ring!&mdash;just where I
dropped it! Oh, oh, oh, he keeps it like this&mdash;hat, gloves,
basket and ring, everything just as it was that crazy, mad day
when I&mdash; [She glances at Fiddler and breaks off.] But for
heaven's sake, Fiddler, set that chair on its feet!

Fiddler. Against orders, ma'am.

Cynthia. Against orders?

Fiddler. You kicked it over, ma'am, the day you left us.

Cynthia. No wonder he hates me with the chair in that state!
He nurses his wrath to keep it warm. So, after all, Fiddler,
everything is changed, and that chair is the proof of it. I[Pg 695]
suppose Cynthia K is the only thing in the world that cares a
whinney whether I'm alive or dead. [She breaks down and sobs.]
How is she, Fiddler?

Fiddler. Off her oats, ma'am, this evening.

Cynthia. Off her oats! Well, she loves me, so I suppose she
will die, or change, or&mdash;or something. Oh, she'll die, there's no
doubt about that&mdash;she'll die. [Fiddler, who has been watching
his chance, takes the key off the table while she is sobbing, tiptoes
up stage, unlocks the door and goes out. After he has done so,
Cynthia rises and dries her eyes.] There&mdash;I'm a fool&mdash;I must go&mdash;before&mdash;before&mdash;he&mdash;


[As she speaks her last word, John comes in swiftly.


John. Mrs. Karslake!

Cynthia. [Confused.] I&mdash;I&mdash;I just heard Cynthia K was ill&mdash; [John
assents. Cynthia tries to put on a cheerful and indifferent
manner.] I&mdash;I ran round&mdash;I&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash; [Pausing,
she turns and takes a few steps.] Well, I understand it's all over.

John. [Cheerfully.] Yes, it's all over.

Cynthia. How is the bride?

John. Oh, she's a wonder.

Cynthia. Indeed! Did she paw the ground like the war-horse
in the Bible? I'm sure when Vida sees a wedding ring she
smells the battle afar off. As for you, my dear Karslake, I
should have thought once bitten, twice shy! But, you know best.

Vida, unable to keep her finger long out of a pie, saunters in.

Vida. Oh, Cynthia, I've just been through it again, and I
feel as if I were eighteen. There's no use talking about it, my
dear, with a woman it's never the second time! And how nice
you were, Jack,&mdash;he never even laughed at us! [Sir Wilfrid
follows her with hat and cane. Vida kisses John.] That's the
wages of virtue!

Sir Wilfrid. [In time to see her kiss John.] I say, is it the
custom? Every time she does that, my boy, you owe me a
thousand pounds. [Seeing Cynthia, who approaches them, he
looks at her and John in turn.] Mrs. Karslake. [To John.] And
then you say it's not an extraordinary country!


[Cynthia is more and more puzzled.


Vida. [To John.] See you next Derby, Jack! [Walking to
the door. To Sir Wilfrid.] Come along, Wilfrid! We really
ought to be going. [To Cynthia.] I hope, dear, you haven't[Pg 696]
married him! Phillimore's a tomb! Good-bye, Cynthia&mdash;I'm
so happy! [As she goes.] Just think of the silly people, dear,
that only have this sensation once in a lifetime!


[John follows Vida out the door.


Sir Wilfrid. [To Cynthia.] Good-bye, Mrs. Karslake.
And I say, ye know, if you have married that dull old Phillimore
fellah, why, when you've divorced him, come over and stay at
Traynham! I mean, of course, ye know, bring your new husband.
There'll be lots o' horses to show you, and a whole covey
of jolly little Cates-Darbys. Mind you come! [With real
delicacy of feeling and forgetting his wife.] Never liked a woman as
much in my life as I did you!

Vida. [Outside; calling him.] Wilfrid, dear!

Sir Wilfrid. [Loyal to the woman who has caught him.] &mdash;except
the one that's calling me!

John returns, and Sir Wilfrid, nodding to him, goes out. John
shuts the door and crosses the room. There is a pause.

Cynthia. So you're not married?

John. No. But I know that you imagined I was.

Cynthia. [After a pause.] I suppose you think a woman has
no right to divorce a man&mdash;and still continue to feel a keen interest
in his affairs?

John. Well, I'm not so sure about that, but I don't quite see
how&mdash;

Cynthia. A woman can be divorced&mdash;and still&mdash; [John
assents; she hides her embarrassment.] Well, my dear Karslake,
you've a long life before you, in which to learn how such a state
of mind is possible! So I won't stop to explain. Will you be
kind enough to get me a cab?                [She moves to the door.

John. Certainly. I was going to say I am not surprised at
your feeling an interest in me. I'm only astonished that, having
actually married Phillimore, you come here&mdash;

Cynthia. [Indignantly.] I'm not married to him!

John. [Silent for a moment.] I left you on the brink&mdash;made
me feel a little uncertain.

Cynthia. [In a matter of course tone.] I changed my mind&mdash;that's all.

John. [Taking his tone from her.] Of course. [After an interval.]
Are you going to marry him?

Cynthia. I don't know.[Pg 697]

John. Does he know you&mdash;

Cynthia. I told him I was coming here.

John. Oh! He'll turn up here, then&mdash;eh? [Cynthia is
silent.] And you'll go back with him, I suppose?

Cynthia. [Talking at random.] Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;I suppose so. I&mdash;I
haven't thought much about it.

John. [Changing his tone.] Well, sit down; do. Till he
comes&mdash;talk it over. [He places the armchair more comfortably
for her.] This is a more comfortable chair!

Cynthia. [Shamefacedly.] You never liked me to sit in that one!

John. Oh, well&mdash;it's different now. [Cynthia moves and sits
down, near the upset chair. There is a long pause, during which
John thoughtfully paces the room.] You don't mind if I smoke?

Cynthia. [Shaking her head.] No.

John. [Lighting his pipe and sitting down on the arm of a chair.]
Of course, if you find my presence painful, I'll&mdash;skiddoo.

He indicates the door. Cynthia shakes her head. John smokes
his pipe and remains seated.

Cynthia. [Suddenly and quickly.] It's just simply a fact,
Karslake, and that's all there is to it&mdash;if a woman has once been
married&mdash;that is, the first man she marries&mdash;then&mdash;she may
quarrel, she may hate him&mdash;she may despise him&mdash;but she'll
always be jealous of him with other women. Always! [John
takes this as if he were simply glad to have the information.

John. Oh&mdash;H'm! ah&mdash;yes&mdash;yes.

Cynthia. [After a pause.] You probably felt jealous of Phillimore.

John. [Reasonably, sweetly, and in doubt.] N-o! [Apologetically.]
I felt simply: Let him take his medicine.

Cynthia. Oh!

John. I beg your pardon&mdash;I meant&mdash;

Cynthia. You meant what you said!

John. [Moving a step toward her.] Mrs. Karslake; I apologize&mdash;I
won't do it again. But it's too late for you to be out alone&mdash;Philip
will be here in a moment&mdash;and of course, then&mdash;

Cynthia. It isn't what you say&mdash;it's&mdash;it's&mdash;it's everything.
It's the entire situation. Suppose by any chance I don't marry
Phillimore! And suppose I were seen at two or three in the
morning leaving my former husband's house! It's all wrong. I
have no business to be here! I'm going! You're perfectly horrid[Pg 698]
to me, you know&mdash;and&mdash;the whole place&mdash;it's so familiar, and
so&mdash;so associated with&mdash;with&mdash;

John. Discord and misery&mdash;I know&mdash;

Cynthia. Not at all with discord and misery! With harmony
and happiness&mdash;with&mdash;with first love, and infinite hope&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;Jack
Karslake,&mdash;if you don't set that chair on its legs, I
think I'll explode. [John crosses the room rapidly, and sets the
chair on its legs. His tone changes.

John. [While setting chair on its legs.] There! I beg your pardon.

Cynthia. [Nervously.] I believe I hear Philip. [She rises.

John. [Going up to the window.] N-o! That's the policeman
trying the front door! And now, see here, Mrs. Karslake,&mdash;you're
only here for a short minute, because you can't help yourself,
but I want you to understand that I'm not trying to be
disagreeable&mdash;I don't want to revive all the old unhappy&mdash;

Cynthia. Very well, if you don't&mdash;give me my hat. [John
does so.] And my sewing! And my gloves, please! [She indicates
the several articles which lie on the small table.] Thanks!
[Cynthia throws the lot into the fireplace, and returns to the place
she has left near table.] There! I feel better! And now&mdash;all I ask is&mdash;

John. [Laughing.] My stars, what a pleasure it is!

Cynthia. What is?

John. Seeing you in a whirlwind!

Cynthia. [Wounded by his seeming indifference.] Oh!

John. No, but I mean, a real pleasure! Why not? Time's
passed since you and I were together&mdash;and&mdash;eh&mdash;

Cynthia. And you've forgotten what a vile temper I had!

John. [Reflectively.] Well, you did kick the stuffing out of the
matrimonial buggy&mdash;

Cynthia. [Pointedly but with good temper.] It wasn't a buggy;
it was a break cart&mdash; [She stands back of the arm-chair.] It's
all very well to blame me! But when you married me, I'd never
had a bit in my mouth!

John. Well, I guess I had a pretty hard hand. Do you
remember the time you threw both your slippers out of the window?

Cynthia. Yes, and do you remember the time you took my
fan from me by force?

John. After you slapped my face with it![Pg 699]

Cynthia. Oh, oh! I hardly touched your face! And do you
remember the day you held my wrists?

John. You were going to bite me!

Cynthia. Jack! I never! I showed my teeth at you! And I
said I would bite you!

John. Cynthia, I never knew you to break your word! [He
laughs. Casually.] And anyhow&mdash;they were awfully pretty
teeth! [Cynthia, though bolt upright, has ceased to seem pained.]
And I say&mdash;do you remember, Cyn&mdash;


[He leans over her armchair to talk.


Cynthia. [After a pause.] You oughtn't to call me "Cyn"&mdash;it's
not nice of you. It's sort of cruel. I'm not&mdash;Cyn to you
now.

John. Awfully sorry; didn't mean to be beastly, Cyn.
[Cynthia turns quickly. John stamps his foot.] Cynthia! Sorry.
I'll make it a commandment: thou shalt not Cyn!!


[Cynthia laughs and wipes her eyes.


Cynthia. How can you, Jack? How can you?

John. Well, hang it, my dear child, I&mdash;I'm sorry, but you
know I always got foolish with you. Your laugh'd make a horse
laugh. Why, don't you remember that morning in the park
before breakfast&mdash;when you laughed so hard your horse ran
away with you!

Cynthia. I do, I do! [Both laugh. The door opens and
Nogam comes in, unnoticed by either.] But what was it started me
laughing? [Laughing, she sits down and laughs again.] That
morning. Wasn't it somebody we met? [Laughing afresh.]
Wasn't it a man on a horse? [As her memory pieces the picture, she
again goes off into laughter.

John. [Laughing too.] Of course! You didn't know him in
those days! But I did! And he looked a sight in the saddle!

[Nogam, trying to catch their attention, moves toward the table.

Cynthia. Who was it?

John. Phillimore!

Cynthia. He's no laughing matter now. [Seeing Nogam.]
Jack, he's here!

John. Eh? Oh, Nogam?

Nogam. Mr. Phillimore, sir&mdash;

John. In the house?

Nogam. On the street in a hansom, sir&mdash;and he requests Mrs.
Karslake[Pg 700]&mdash;

John. That'll do, Nogam. [Nogam goes out and there is a
pause. John, on his way to the window, looks at Cynthia, who
has slowly risen and turned her back to him.] Well, Cynthia?


[He speaks almost gravely and with finality.]


Cynthia. [Trembling.] Well?

John. It's the hour of decision; are you going to marry him?
[Pause.] Speak up!

Cynthia. Jack,&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;

John. There he is&mdash;you can join him. [He points to the street.

Cynthia. Join Phillimore&mdash;and go home&mdash;with him&mdash;to his
house, and Miss Heneage and&mdash;

John. The door's open.      [He points to the door.

Cynthia. No, no! It's mean of you to suggest it!

John. You won't marry&mdash;

Cynthia. Phillimore&mdash;no; never. [Running to the window.]
No; never, never, Jack.

John. [Opening the window and calling out.] It's all right,
Judge. You needn't wait.

There is a pause. John leaves the window and bursts into laughter.
He moves toward the door and closes it. Cynthia looks dazed.

Cynthia. Jack! [John laughs.] Yes, but I'm here, Jack.

John. Why not?

Cynthia. You'll have to take me round to the Holland House!

John. Of course, I will! But, I say, Cynthia, there's no hurry.

Cynthia. Why, I&mdash;I&mdash;can't stay here.

John. No, of course you can't stay here. But you can have a
bite, though. [Cynthia shakes her head. John places the small
chair, which was upset, next to the table, and the armchair close by.]
Oh, I insist. Just look at yourself&mdash;you're as pale as a sheet and&mdash;here,
here. Sit right down. I insist! By George, you must
do it! [Cynthia moves to the chair drawn up to the table, and sits
down.

Cynthia. [Faintly.] I am hungry.

John. Just wait a moment.


[John rushes out, leaving the door open.


Cynthia. I don't want more than a nibble! [After a pause.]
I am sorry to give you so much trouble.

John. No trouble at all. [From the dining-room comes the
cheerful noise of glasses and silver.] A hansom, of course, to take
you round to your hotel? [Speaking as he returns with a tray.[Pg 701]

Cynthia. [To herself.] I wonder how I ever dreamed I could
marry that man.

John. [Now by the table.] Can't imagine! There!

Cynthia. I am hungry. Don't forget the hansom.

[She eats; he waits on her, setting this and that before her.

John. [Goes to the door, opens it and calls.] Nogam, a hansom at once.

Nogam. [From without.] Yes, sir.

John. [Again at the table, shows, and from now on continues
to show, his true feelings for her.] How does it go?

Cynthia. [Faintly.] It goes all right. Thanks!


[Hardly eating at all.


John. You always used to like anchovy. [Cynthia nods and
eats.] Claret? [Cynthia shakes her head.] Oh, but you must!

Cynthia. [Tremulously.] Ever so little. [He fills her glass and
then his.] Thanks!

John. Here's to old times!      [Raising his glass.

Cynthia. [Very tremulous.] Please not!

John. Well, here's to your next husband.

Cynthia. [Very tenderly.] Don't!

John. Oh, well, then, what shall the toast be?

Cynthia. I'll tell you&mdash; [After a pause.] you can drink to the
relation I am to you!

John. [Laughing.] Well&mdash;what relation are you?

Cynthia. I'm your first wife once removed!

John. [Laughing, drinks.] I say, you're feeling better.

Cynthia. Lots.

John. [Reminiscent.] It's a good deal like those mornings
after the races&mdash;isn't it?

Cynthia. [Nods.] Yes. [Half-rising.] Is that the hansom?

John. [Going up to the window.] No.

Cynthia. [Sitting down again.] What is that sound?

John. Don't you remember?

Cynthia. No.

John. That's the rumbling of the early milk wagons.

Cynthia. Oh, Jack.

John. Do you recognize it now?

Cynthia. Do I? We used to hear that&mdash;just at the hour,
didn't we&mdash;when we came back from awfully jolly late suppers and things!

John. H'm![Pg 702]

Cynthia. It must be fearfully late. I must go.

She rises and moves to the chair where she has left her cloak. She
sees that John will not help her and puts it on herself.

John. Oh, don't go&mdash;why go?

Cynthia. [Embarrassed and agitated.] All good things come to
an end, you know.

John. They don't need to.

Cynthia. Oh, you don't mean that! And, you know, Jack,
if I were caught&mdash;seen at this hour, leaving this house, you know&mdash;it's
the most scandalous thing any one ever did, my being here
at all. Good-bye, Jack! [After a pause and almost in tears.] I'd
like to say, I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;well, I sha'n't be bitter about you hereafter,
and&mdash; [Halting.] Thank you awfully, old man, for the fodder
and all that!      [She turns to go out.

John. Mrs. Karslake&mdash;wait&mdash;

Cynthia. [Stopping to hear.] Well?

John. [Serious.] I've rather an ugly bit of news for you.

Cynthia. Yes?

John. I don't believe you know that I have been testing the
validity of the decree of divorce which you procured.

Cynthia. Oh, have you?

John. Yes; you know I felt pretty warmly about it.

Cynthia. Well?

John. Well, I've been successful. [After a pause.] The
decree's been declared invalid. Understand?

Cynthia. [Looking at him for a moment; then speaking.]
Not&mdash;precisely.

John. [After a moment's silence.] I'm awfully sorry&mdash;I'm
awfully sorry, Cynthia, but, you're my wife still.


[There is a pause.


Cynthia. [With rapture.] Honour bright?


[She sinks into the armchair.


John. [Nods. Half laughingly.] Crazy country, isn't it?

Cynthia. [Nods. After an interval.] Well, Jack&mdash;what's to
be done?

John. [Gently.] Whatever you say.


[He moves a few steps toward her.


Nogam. [Quietly coming in.] Hansom, sir.


[He goes out and Cynthia rises.
[Pg 703]

John. Why don't you finish your supper?


[Cynthia hesitates.


Cynthia. The&mdash;the&mdash;hansom&mdash;

John. Why go to the Holland? After all&mdash;you know, Cyn,
you're at home here.

Cynthia. No, Jack, I'm not&mdash;I'm not at home here&mdash;unless&mdash;unless&mdash;

John. Out with it!

Cynthia. [Bursting into tears.] Unless I&mdash;unless I'm at home
in your heart, Jack!

John. What do you think?

Cynthia. I don't believe you want me to stay.

John. Don't you?

Cynthia. No, no, you hate me still. You never can forgive
me. I know you can't. For I can never forgive myself. Never,
Jack, never, never!


[She sobs and he takes her in his arms.


John. [Very tenderly.] Cyn! I love you! [Strongly.] And
you've got to stay! And hereafter you can chuck chairs around
till all's blue! Not a word now.

[He draws her gently to a chair.

Cynthia. [Wiping her tears.] Oh, Jack! Jack!

John. I'm as hungry as a shark. We'll nibble together.

Cynthia. Well, all I can say is, I feel that of all the improprieties
I ever committed this&mdash;this&mdash;

John. This takes the claret, eh? Oh, Lord, how happy I am!

Cynthia. Now don't say that! You'll make me cry more.

She wipes her eyes. John takes out the wedding ring from his
pocket; he lifts a wine-glass, drops the ring into it and offers her
the glass.

John. Cynthia!

Cynthia. [Looking at it and wiping her eyes.] What is it?

John. Benedictine!

Cynthia. Why, you know I never take it.

John. Take this one for my sake.

Cynthia. That's not benedictine. [With gentle curiosity.]
What is it?

John. [Slides the ring out of the glass and puts his arm about
Cynthia. He slips the ring on to her finger and, as he kisses her
hand, says:] Your wedding ring!

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
