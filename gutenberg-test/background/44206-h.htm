<h2>OLD-TIME NAUTICAL INSTRUMENTS</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By John Robinson</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Curator of the Marine Room, Peabody Museum, Salem, Mass.</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HAT sort of instruments did
the Colonial ship-masters carry?
What did they have on
the <i>Mayflower</i>? What did Columbus
use? And, to come down to comparatively
recent times, what instruments
were available and were actually
used on the vessels during the
commercial-marine activities following
the American Revolution and up to the
time of the appearance of steamships?</p>

<p>These questions are often asked,
not only by landsmen but by seafaring
men as well. The ship-master of today
uses instruments so different from
those of Colonial times, or even of the
earlier years of the nineteenth century,
that unless he has a penchant
for research he knows nothing about
the earlier ones and certainly not how
to use them if by chance they come
to his notice. Holding in his hand a
Davis quadrant, the skilful navigator
of Salem’s last square-rigger, the ship
<i>Mindoro</i>, which passed out of service
in 1897, said to the writer:—“I have
no idea how to use it and I do not
believe that there is a ship-master sailing
out of Boston today who does.”
The Davis quadrant was in common
use all through the eighteenth century
and probably later. It is figured and
explained in a book on navigation in
1796. There are two in the Peabody
Museum collection in Salem, dated
respectively, 1768 and 1773, and an
undated one in the collection is certainly
older. Only the student of the
history of navigation can explain them
or their uses. The English navigator,
John Davis, the inventor of this quadrant,
in his “Seaman’s Secrets”, printed
in 1594, gives a list of instruments
which should be taken on ships, but it
is to be feared few vessels carried them
all or that owners were able to provide
them. It included,—sea-compass,
cross-staff, chart, quadrant, astrolabe,
instrument to test compass variation,
horizontal plane sphere, and paradoxical
compass.</p>

<p>No one knows exactly what instruments
Columbus took with him on his
voyage in 1492. He undoubtedly had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
an astrolabe and a cross-staff. The
astrolabe was devised during the first
millennium and Arabian astronomers
had perfected it as early as the year
700. It is really the basis of all future
instruments of its class,—cross-staff,
quadrant, sextant. Some of the
most beautiful astrolabes preserved in
museums are those made for the Persian
astronomers in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. Columbus probably
used the form devised by Martin
Behaim which had been adapted for
use at sea about the year 1480. Observations
with the astrolabe required
three persons, one to hold the instrument
plumb by the ring, another to
sight the sun and adjust the arm, and
the third to read the scale. With these
difficulties observations were, of
course, far from accurate, but approximate
time and latitude could be obtained.
Another device was the ring-dial,
or universal ring-dial as the old
works on navigation called it. This
differed from the astrolabe by having
adjustable rings with the hours and
scales engraved upon them. Both of
these instruments are now rare.</p>

<p>No original cross-staff is known to
the writer in any collection in this
country. It consisted of a rod thirty-six
inches long on which another of
twenty-six inches was centered and arranged
to slide up and down at right
angles to it. By sighting from the
end of the longer rod and moving the
sliding bar until the sun was seen at
one end of it and the horizon at the
other, the figure on the scale at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
junction of the rods indicated the sun’s
altitude and from this the latitude was
obtained.</p>

<p>Based on this instrument, by laying
out the circle on a table, John Davis,
the explorer, devised his quadrant in
1586. At first the observer used it
by facing the sun, as the cross-staff
had been used, but a better form was
made later where the observer had the
sun at his back. This instrument has
been called by sailors “jackass quadrant”
and, supposedly from its shape,
“hog-yoke.” In early books on navigation
it is called “sea-quadrant.” The
earlier form used by the observer
standing back to the sun had a solid
“shade vane” which slid along the
smaller arc of the instrument. By
adjusting this a little short of the supposed
altitude of the sun and sighting
the horizon through the minute hole
in the “sight vane” until it was seen
through the “horizon vane” at the apex
of the instrument, and then gradually
moving the “sight vane” along the
larger arc until the shadow of the
“shade vane” met the horizon line,
the sum of the degrees on the two
scales indicated the sun’s altitude. This
was really the second form of the
Davis quadrant. In the third, the solid
“shade vane” was replaced by one with
a low-power lens inserted in it arranged
to focus on the “horizon vane,”
thus approaching the idea of the reflected
sun in the Hadley quadrant and
the sextant. A most interesting instrument,
half-way between a cross-staff
and the Davis quadrant, is illustrated
in Seller’s book on navigation published
in 1676. He calls it a “Plough.”
Above, it has the small arc of the
Davis quadrant with the sliding rod of
the cross-staff below. These were, of
course, imperfect instruments, but still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
a great advance over previous devices
to obtain time and latitude.<br /><br /></p>

<p>The Davis quadrants are usually
made of ebony, rosewood, or other
dark woods, with boxwood scale arcs
and could be made by expert wood-workers.
The numerous examples preserved
attest the skill of the old cabinet-makers,
for they are never warped
or twisted while their jointing is a
Chinese puzzle. Probably the <i>Mayflower</i>
carried a Davis quadrant and
quite likely an astrolabe, and of course,
a compass, for the compass had been
in use for two centuries.</p>

<p>Whether the compass was independently
invented in Europe or was borrowed
from the Chinese is uncertain.
The old marine compasses were set in
gimbals. The magnet was a thin bar
attached, usually with sealing wax, to
the under side of the compass card, the
whole mounted in a thin bowl of
turned wood. These were the compasses
of the eighteenth century. There
is one in the Salem collection inscribed,—“Benjamin
King Salem in New
England”, with the date “1770” cut
in the box; another has the mark of
Benjamin King, 1790. A surveyor’s
compass, wooden throughout, including
wooden sights, is inscribed,—“Made
by James Halsey near ye draw bridge
Boston.” The liquid compass first
suggested by Francis Crow in 1813
and improved by E. S. Ritchie of Boston,
has largely displaced the older
devices.</p>

<p>The “nocturnal”, used at night, as
its name signifies, appeared at an early
date, exactly when it does not seem
possible to say. One in the Salem collection
is marked,—“Nathaniel
Viall 1724”. By adjusting the movable discs
to the date on the scale for the day of
the month, sighting the north star
through the hole in the center and then
bringing the arm against the “guard
stars”, the hour was indicated with
reasonable accuracy. Good pictures
and descriptions of the nocturnal may
be found in old books on navigation.</p>

<p>In 1730, John Hadley in England
and Thomas Godfrey in Philadelphia,
independently invented the octant,
known for nearly two hundred years
as Hadley’s quadrant. Both Hadley
and Godfrey received awards for their
devices. Although called quadrant in
this country it is generally known
elsewhere as octant, which is the better
name, for the instrument represents
but one eighth of the circle. By
the principle of reflection, however, it
covers ninety degrees and the scale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
is so marked. The Davis quadrant
with its two arcs does represent one
fourth of the circle and for that instrument
the name is correct.</p>

<p>The Hadley was a great improvement
over the Davis quadrant and
other older devices for finding latitude.
By moving the arm the sun is
reflected by the mirror at the apex
and “brought down” to the horizon
line and the eye is protected by colored
glasses of various degrees of density
through which the sun’s rays
shine. Catching the sun the instant
it is on the meridian (noon), the scale
indicates the altitude by which the
latitude was figured with the Bowditch
Navigator, used for more than
one hundred years by American seamen,
or Moore’s before that and
numerous others back to the early
eighteenth century. The Hadley quadrant
is still used in its modern form
with telescopic eye-pieces although the
sextant—one-sixth of the circle and
by reflection one-third—is a more accurate
instrument and also may be
used to make lunar observations to obtain
longitude, a complicated and difficult
matter, so difficult that the authors
of the older works did not even
take trouble to explain the process, for
only the most expert could make this
observation, nor were the results satisfactory.</p>

<p>The sextant was devised about 1757
and as now made is framed wholly of
metal. To prevent corrosion, the scale,
which is minutely divided, and has a
“vernier” with a magnifying glass
to show divisions of minutes, is made
of gold or platinum in the best instruments.
A half-circle has been devised
and is exceedingly rare. An example
in the Salem collection was made before
1818. A curious double-jointed
dividers accompanied it and the entry
in the museum catalog reads,—“used
to correct a lunar observation for longitude.”
A full “circle of reflection”
is also sometimes used, more often on
land than at sea. This is a beautiful
instrument and is not often met with
in collections or in use. All of these
instruments are similar in character
and may be traced, as previously
stated, to the ancestral astrolabe.</p>

<p>The early Hadley quadrants were
huge affairs made of wood with an
arm twenty-four inches in length. Today
they are more generally of metal
with arms from ten to twelve inches.
Using the sextent or Hadley quadrant
the observer stands facing the
sun, but old Hadley quadrants were
made with a “back sight” so that they
could be used like the Davis quadrant,
thus making two independent observations
the average of which would ensure
greater accuracy.</p>

<p>To obtain the ship’s latitude with
comparatively good results was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
easy matter with the quadrant and its
fore-runners, but the great problem
for centuries was how to find the longitude,
now universally and quickly
obtained by the chronometer and simple
observations in the morning or at
noon. Spring clocks and watches appeared
about 1530 but they were unreliable
and of no use on long voyages.
Sand glasses like those of the old Colonial
churches were used on ships and
so conservative is the British mind that
some were in use on British naval vessels
as late as 1828 and one authority
states as late as 1839. Greenwich Observatory
was established in 1675 and
a Royal Commission was soon appointed
with authority to award prizes
for important inventions in aid of navigation.
A prize of £20,000 was finally
offered for a time-keeper that should
meet certain requirements which practically
meant absolute accuracy. In
1767, John Harrison produced the
chronometer, based on the principle of
an invention of 1735, and eventually
he received the reward. Chronometers
were so expensive and so hard to obtain
that few New England ships had
them until more than a half a century
later. Other devices were tried to obtain
longitude by lunar observations
and by Jupiter’s satellites, but these
observations were too difficult to be
of practical use. Today, fine watches
serve for short trips and chronometers
are carried by nearly all vessels making
long voyages.</p>

<p>That so important an instrument as
a telescope or spy-glass is rarely mentioned
in books on navigation or in
sea journals seems strange. It is exceedingly
difficult to obtain information
of any being taken to sea, although
one would think a spy-glass
would be about the first aid on shipboard
especially when skirting the
coast. Telescopes did not become of
practical use, even if the principle had
been known, until they were made in
Holland in 1608. It is at least certain
that Columbus did not have one and
probably there was none on the <i>Mayflower</i>,
although its passengers had
recently come from Holland where
telescopes were invented a few years
before. So far no references to them
have been found in a rather casual examination
of old log-books.</p>

<p>In the Marine Room Collection of
the Peabody Museum at Salem, is a
spy-glass four feet long, octagonal in
form, two and one-half inches in diameter,
with a short focusing tube.
It was taken from a British prize vessel
off the coast of Ireland, in 1779,
by Capt. James Barr in his Salem privateer.
Another glass of similar form,
but longer and with a mahogany case,
was used on a United States naval vessel
about 1815. The spy-glass, familiar
to everyone, in two or three sections,
was used at sea through the first
half of the nineteenth century and is
often seen tucked under the left arm,
in the portraits of ship-masters
brought home from foreign ports.
Many of these were excellent instruments,
especially those from Dollond
of London. There is also in the Salem
collection a rude telescope or spy-glass
five and one-half feet long with
a copper case about three inches in
diameter looking precisely like a section
from a house water-conductor.
It focuses by a small upper sliding section,
fitted like a stove funnel. This
glass was brought from Nagasaki, Japan,
by a Salem ship-master about
1865. It had been used there to observe
vessels coming into the harbor.
It may be Dutch and it is evidently
very old.</p>

<p>The speed of a vessel was first obtained
by throwing overboard a floating
subject at the bow and noting the
time elapsed when it passed an observer
at the stern. From this the log
line with “knots” was derived, with
the fourteen and twenty-eight seconds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
sand glasses to record speed. A “knot”
indicates a geographical or sea mile
which has been standardized at 6080
feet; the land or statute mile is 5280
feet, therefore, if a vessel is said to be
sailing at the rate of thirteen knots,
a railroad train going at the same
speed would be running at the rate of
fifteen miles an hour. The term “knot”
is used solely to indicate rate of speed;
the distance covered is always stated
in nautical or sea miles. “Heaving the
log” meant throwing out from the
stern of a vessel a small float attached
to a line running from a reel held clear
of the rail, the float remaining stationary
in the water. At the instant
the log is “heaved” a sand glass is
turned. On the line are knots (hence
the term), pieces of marline or rags
tied through the strands and spaced
the same fraction of a mile apart,—above
forty-six feet and six inches,—which
twenty-eight seconds is the
fraction of an hour,—about one one-hundred
and twenty-eighth. Therefore,
using a twenty-eight seconds glass and
checking the line the instant the sand
runs out, the number of knots and
fractions paid out on the line will at
once indicate the number of sea miles
per hour which the vessel is going.
This, of course, is doubled if the fourteen-seconds
glass is used, which is
done when the vessel is going very fast.</p>

<p class="tb">The old log lines have been superseded
by many forms of the “patent
log” and the museum is indeed fortunate
which possesses an original log
line, reel and float in perfect condition.
There is an excellent example in the
museum collections of the Marblehead
Historical Society. Once discarded,
the lines were soon used to tie up
packages and the reels and floats were
thrown away. The patent log with its
revolving blades, now universal, was
devised by Humfray Cole in 1578;
it was improved by various persons
from time to time but, strange to say,
did not come into general use for nearly
three centuries. The rotating blades
in the water record the rate on an indicator
on the vessel which may be
read at any time. So far, the earliest
reference to the use of a device of this
sort among our New England navigators
is the “Gould’s patent log” used
by Captain George Crowninshield on
his famous yacht <i>Cleopatra’s Barge</i>
during the voyage to the Mediterranean
in 1817.</p>

<p class="tb">Charts were made in very ancient
times but they were crude and almost
useless. The first nautical maps appeared
in Italy at the end of the thirteenth
century, and it is said that
Bartholomew Columbus brought the
first one to England in 1489. The
close of the sixteenth century saw
many map makers at work, including
Gerard Mercator whose name is perpetuated
in the familiar scale charts
in our geographies known as “Mercator’s
projection” which were the sea
charts in general use. Globes were
carried on ships in preference to charts
in the early days and what is known as
“great circle” sailing was evolved from
them. Davis describes it in 1594 and
it is possible that Cabot knew of the
theory a century before. Such a simple
instrument as a parallel ruler was
not invented until late in the sixteenth
century and tables of logarithms and
Gunter’s scale by which navigators
make all their calculations were not
known until the year the <i>Mayflower</i>
sailed.</p>

<p class="tb">During the first century following
the settlement of New England it is
probable that the small coasting and
fishing vessels were navigated by dead
reckoning and not venturing far beyond
the sight of land a compass was
the only instrument carried. But the
larger vessels sailing from Boston,
Salem, Portsmouth, Newport and other
ports on voyages to the West Indies,
England and Spain, it would seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
should have carried instruments with
which observations could be made to
obtain their approximate position. Mr.
George Francis Dow has searched the
early probate records of Essex County
coast towns between 1634 and 1680, a
period of nearly fifty years, and finds
but thirteen references to nautical instruments
in inventories and wills.
Sometimes they are listed as “marriners
instruments” and in one case a
quadrant is valued at £1. Robert Gray
of Salem, who died in 1661, possessed
a “quadrant, a fore-staffe (cross-staff),
a gunter’s scale, and a pair of Compasses.”
John Bradstreet, who died
at Marblehead the previous year,
owned “3 small sea books” valued at
£1. 6s. The inventory of the estate of
Jonathan Browne of Salem, who died
in 1667, discloses a “fore-staff,” and
that of the estate of John Silsby of
Salem, taken in 1676, lists “marriners
instruments and callender, 14s.”</p>

<p>In a very detailed inventory made
in Salem before a notary publick on
Nov. 4, 1702, of the equipment of the
ship <i>Province Galley</i>, 90 tons, owned
by Roger Derby, the only instruments
for navigation that appear are “Two
Compasses, two ha[lf] ho[ur] glasses,
a ha[lf] Watchglass, a ha[lf] minute
glass ... a hand lead line, a deep
sea lead line.”</p>

<p>The <i>Boston News-Letter</i>, July 16,
1716, has the following advertisement:
“A Parcel of Mathematical Instruments,
viz: Quadrants, Meridian Compasses,
all sorts of Rules, black lead
Pencils, and brass Ring Dials, etc. To
be sold by Publick Vendue at the
Crown Coffee House in King’s Street,
Boston, on Thursday next.” The same
issue has the advertisement of “William
Walker in Merchants Row, near
the Swing Bridge,” who had quadrants
for sale.</p>

<p>In looking back and noting the slow
process of perfecting all nautical instruments,
the wonder is how the old
ships were navigated through distant
seas without greater loss of life and
vessels. The dangers were real during
our commercial-marine activities following
the period of the Revolution
and the early nineteenth century, as
attested by reference to old newspapers
and letters, and to such records
as the Diary of Rev. William Bentley
of Salem, where nearly every Sunday
some of his parishioners asked for
prayers for friends at sea or for the
loss of husband, son or brother. The
shipmasters of Salem, Boston, Providence,
New York and Baltimore, undertaking
distant voyages, had few
good charts—none for the new regions
they visited—they had no chronometers,
few had sextants, and their compasses
were frequently unreliable. And
yet these men—most of them were
scarcely past their majority in years—with
the courage and enthusiasm of
youth, in ships filled with valuable
cargoes, entrusted to their care by
wealthy owners, sailed into uncharted
seas, visited unknown lands, and, all
the while rarely reported, finally came
safely back, to their everlasting credit
and the enrichment of the country.</p>

<p>We do not know exactly what instruments
the old shipmasters carried
with them on these voyages, but we do
know that they were comparatively
few and very inferior to those in use
today. An idea of the paucity in some
instances may be obtained from the
story of the ship <i>Hannah</i>, condemned
at Christiansand in 1810, in the protest
of American shipmasters which is
now preserved in the New Haven Historical
Society collections. It reads:
“We, the undersigned masters of
American vessels now in the port of
Christiansand, having heard with astonishment
that one of the principal
charges against the American brig
<i>Hannah</i>, from Boston, bound direct to
Riga, and condemned at the prize
court at this place, is as follows,—that
the said court have pronounced it absolutely
impossible to cross the Atlan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>tic
without a chart or sextant. We
therefore feel fully authorized to assert
that we have frequently made voyages
from America without the above articles,
and we are fully persuaded that
every seaman with common nautical
knowledge can do the same.”</p>

<p class="tb">No doubt many valuable data lie
hidden in old log-books and sea journals,
early newspaper files, shipping
records of old business houses and
elsewhere. To anyone with time and
the inclination for research a fascinating
field is open where material of
historical and scientific value may be
found. The writer is not aware that
any such investigations have been
made or accounts of any published.</p>

<p class="tb">Accurate knowledge of the instruments
carried by Colonial shipmasters
on their voyages to the West Indies or
along our coast and across the Atlantic
would be of much interest, and still
more to know what were supplied by
owners or carried as their personal
property by masters and supercargoes
for the longer voyages to Russia, the
Mediterranean, Africa, India, China,
and the South Seas. It would be interesting
to know, besides this, what
had been their experiences with them:
the accuracy of observations, how the
compass behaved, etc. The early nineteenth
century shipmasters were close
observers, and in his works on navigation
Lieut. M. F. Maury pays them
high compliment for the valuable assistance
rendered in furnishing notes
and observations on currents, shoals,
coast lines, compass variations and
winds, for the charts and sailing directions
which he compiled.</p>

<p>With these things in mind this paper
has been prepared, hoping that someone
may be encouraged to take up the
work systematically. It is a subject
which seems to have been neglected,
and the results certainly will repay
much time devoted to its investigation.<br /><br /></p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
