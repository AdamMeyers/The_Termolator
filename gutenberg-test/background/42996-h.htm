<p class="first"><b>Palli or Vanniyan.&mdash;</b>Writing concerning
this caste the Census Superintendent, 1871, records that &ldquo;a book
has been written by a native to show that the Pallis (Pullies or
Vanniar) of the south are descendants of the fire races (Agnikulas) of
the Kshatriyas, and that the Tamil Pullies were at one time the
shepherd kings of Egypt.&rdquo; At the time of the census, 1871, a
petition was submitted to Government by representatives of the caste,
praying that they might be classified as Kshatriyas, and twenty years
later, in connection with the census, 1891, a book entitled
&lsquo;Vannikula Vilakkam: a treatise on the Vanniya caste,&rsquo; was
compiled by Mr. T. Aiyakannu Nayakar, in support of the caste claim to
be returned as Kshatriyas, for details concerning which claim I must
refer the reader to the book itself. In 1907, a book entitled Varuna
Darpanam (Mirror of Castes) was published, in which an attempt is made
to connect the caste with the Pallavas.</p>
<p>Kulas&#275;khara, one of the early Travancore kings, and one of the
most renowned &#256;lwars reverenced by the Sr&#299; Vaishnava
community in Southern India, is claimed by the Pallis as a king of
their caste. Even now, at the Parthas&#257;rathi temple in Triplicane
(in the city of Madras), which according to inscriptions is a Pallava
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>temple, Pallis celebrate his anniversary with great
&eacute;clat. The Pallis of K&#333;mal&#275;svaranpettah in the city of
Madras have a Kulas&#275;khara Perum&#257;l Sabha, which manages the
celebration of the anniversary. The temple has recently been converted
at considerable cost into a temple for the great &#256;lwar. A similar
celebration is held at the Chint&#257;dripettah &#256;dik&#275;sava
Perum&#257;l temple in Madras. The Pallis have the right to present the
most important camphor offering of the Mylapore Siva temple. They
allege that the temple was originally theirs, but by degrees they lost
their hold over it until this bare right was left to them. Some years
ago, there was a dispute concerning the exercise of this right, and the
case came before the High Court of Madras, which decided the point at
issue in favour of the Pallis. One of the principal g&#333;puras
(pyramidal towers) of the &#274;k&#257;mran&#257;tha temple at Big
Conjeeveram, the ancient capital of the Pallavas, is known as
Pallig&#333;puram. The Pallis of that town claim it as their own, and
repair it from time to time. In like manner, they claim that the
founder of the Chidambaram temple, by name Sw&#275;ta Varman,
subsequently known as Hiranya Varman (sixth century A.D.) was a Pallava
king. At Pichavaram, four miles east of Chidambaram, lives a Palli
family, which claims to be descended from Hiranya Varman. A curious
ceremony is even now celebrated at the Chidambaram temple, on the steps
leading to the central sanctuary. As soon as the eldest son of this
family is married, he and his wife, accompanied by a local
Vell&#257;la, repair to the sacred shrine, and there, amidst crowds of
their castemen and others, a h&#333;mam (sacrificial fire) is raised,
and offerings are made to it. The couple are then anointed with nine
different kinds of holy water, and the Vell&#257;la places the temple
crown on their heads. The Vell&#257;la who officiates <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>at this
ceremony, assisted by the temple priests, is said to belong to the
family of a former minister of a descendant of Hiranya Varman. It is
said that, as the ceremony is a costly one, and the expenses have to be
paid by the individual who undergoes it, it often happens that the
eldest son of the family has to remain a bachelor for half his
lifetime. The Pallis who reside at St. Thom&eacute; in the city of
Madras allege that they became Christians, with their King Kandappa
R&#257;ja, who, they say, ruled over Mylapore during the time of the
visit of St. Thomas. In 1907, Mr. T. Varadappa Nayakar, the only High
Court Vakil (pleader) among the Palli community practising in Madras,
brought out a Tamil book on the history of the connection of the caste
with the ancient Pallava kings.</p>
<p>In reply to one of a series of questions promulgated by the Census
Superintendent, it was stated that &ldquo;the caste is known by the
following names:&mdash;Agnikulas and Vanniyas. The etymology of these
is the same, being derived from the Sanskrit Agni or Vahni, meaning
fire. The following, taken from Dr. Oppert&rsquo;s article on the
original inhabitants of Bharatavarsa or India, explains the name of the
caste with its etymology:&mdash;&lsquo;The word Vanniyan is generally
derived from the Sanskrit Vahni, fire. Agni, the god of fire, is
connected with regal office, as kings hold in their hands the
fire-wheel or Agneya-chakra, and the Vanniyas urge in support of their
name the regal descent they claim.&rsquo; The existence of these fire
races, Agnikula or Vahnikula (Vanniya), in North and South India is a
remarkable fact. No one can refuse to a scion of the non-Aryan warrior
tribe the title of Rajputra, but in so doing we establish at once Aryan
and non-Aryan Rajaputras or Rajputs. The Vanniyan of South India may be
accepted as a representative of the non-Aryan Rajput element.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span></p>
<p>The name Vanniyan is, Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e456src" href="#xd21e456" name="xd21e456src">1</a> &ldquo;derived
from the Sanskrit vanhi (fire) in consequence of the following legend.
In the olden times, two giants named V&#257;t&#257;pi and M&#257;hi,
worshipped Brahma with such devotion that they obtained from him
immunity from death from every cause save fire, which element they had
carelessly omitted to include in their enumeration. Protected thus,
they harried the country, and V&#257;t&#257;pi went the length of
swallowing V&#257;yu, the god of the winds, while M&#257;hi devoured
the sun. The earth was therefore enveloped in perpetual darkness and
stillness, a condition of affairs which struck terror into the minds of
the d&#275;vatas, and led them to appeal to Brahma. He, recollecting
the omission made by the giants, directed his suppliants to desire the
rishi J&#257;mbava Mah&#257;muni to perform a y&#257;gam, or sacrifice
by fire. The order having been obeyed, armed horse men sprung from the
flames, who undertook twelve expeditions against V&#257;t&#257;pi and
M&#257;hi, whom they first destroyed, and afterwards released V&#257;yu
and the sun from their bodies. Their leader then assumed the government
of the country under the name R&#363;dra Vanniya Mah&#257;r&#257;ja,
who had five sons, the ancestors of the Vanniya caste. These facts are
said to be recorded in the Vaid&#299;swara temple in the Tanjore
district.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vaid&#299;swara temple here referred to is the Vaid&#299;swara
k&#333;vil near Shiy&#257;li. Mr. Stuart adds that &ldquo;this
tradition alludes to the destruction of the city of V&#257;pi by
Narasimha Varma, king of the Pallis or Pallavas.&rdquo; V&#257;pi, or
V&#257;-api, was the ancient name of V&#257;t&#257;pi or
B&#257;d&#257;mi in the Bombay Presidency. It was the capital of the
Ch&#257;lukyas, who, during the seventh <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>century, were at feud with
the Pallavas of the south. &ldquo;The son of Mah&#275;ndra Varman
I,&rdquo; writes Rai Bahadur V. Venkayya, &ldquo;was Narasimha Varman
I, who retrieved the fortunes of the family by repeatedly defeating the
Ch&#333;las, K&#275;ralas, Kalabhras, and P&#257;ndyas. He also claims
to have written the word victory as on a plate on
Pulik&#275;sin&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="xd21e463src" href=
"#xd21e463" name="xd21e463src">2</a> back, which was caused to be
visible (<i>i.e.</i>, which was turned in flight after defeat) at
several battles. Narasimha Varman carried the war into Ch&#257;lukyan
territory, and actually captured V&#257;t&#257;pi their capital. This
claim of his is established by an inscription found at
B&#257;d&#257;mi, from which it appears that Narasimha Varman bore the
title Mah&#257;malla. In later times, too, this Pallava king was known
as V&#257;t&#257;pi Konda Narasingapottaraiyan. Dr. Fleet assigns the
capture of the Ch&#257;lukya capital to about A.D. 642. The war of
Narasimha Varman with Pulik&#275;sin is mentioned in the Sinhalese
chronicle Mah&#257;vamsa. It is also hinted at in the Tamil
Periyapur&#257;nam. The well-known saint Siruttonda, who had his only
son cut up and cooked in order to satisfy the appetite of the god Siva
disguised as a devotee, is said to have reduced to dust the city of
V&#257;t&#257;pi for his royal master, who could be no other than the
Pallava king Narasimha Varman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gather, from a note by Mr. F. R. Hemingway, that the Pallis
&ldquo;tell a long story of how they are descendants of one V&#299;ra
Vanniyan, who was created by a sage named Sambuha when he was
destroying the two demons named V&#257;t&#257;pi and Enat&#257;pi. This
V&#299;ra Vanniyan married a daughter of the god Indra, and had five
sons, named R&#363;dra, Brahma, Krishna, Sambuha, and Kai, whose
descendants now live respectively in the country north <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>of the
P&#257;l&#257;r in the Cauvery delta, between the P&#257;l&#257;r and
Pennar. They have written a Pur&#257;nam and a drama bearing on this
tale. They declare that they are superior to Br&#257;hmans, since,
while the latter must be invested with the sacred thread after birth,
they bring their sacred thread with them at birth itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Vanniyans,&rdquo; Mr. Nelson states,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e475src" href="#xd21e475" name="xd21e475src">3</a> &ldquo;are
at the present time a small and obscure agricultural caste, but there
is reason to believe that they are descendants of ancestors who, in
former times, held a good position among the tribes of South India. A
manuscript, abstracted at page 90 of the Catalogue raisonn&eacute;
(Mackenzie Manuscripts), states that the Vanniyans belong to the
Agnikula, and are descended from the Muni Sambhu; and that they gained
victories by means of their skill in archery. And another manuscript,
abstracted at page 427, shows that two of their chiefs enjoyed
considerable power, and refused to pay the customary tribute to the
Rayar, who was for a long time unable to reduce them to submission.
Armies of Vanniyans are often mentioned in Ceylon annals. And a Hindu
History of Ceylon, translated in the Royal As. Soc. Journal, Vol. XXIV,
states that, in the year 3300 of the Kali Yuga, a Pandya princess went
over to Ceylon, and married its king, and was accompanied by sixty
bands of Vanniyans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The terms Vanni and Vanniyan are used in Tamil poems to denote king.
Thus, in the classical Tamil poem Kall&#257;dam, which has been
attributed to the time of Tiruvalluvar, the author of the sacred Kural,
Vanni is used in the sense of king. Kamban, the author of the Tamil
R&#257;m&#257;yana, uses it in a similar sense. In <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>an
inscription dated 1189 A.D., published by Dr. E. Hultzsch,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e482src" href="#xd21e482" name="xd21e482src">4</a>
Vanniya N&#257;yan appears among the titles of the local chief of
Tiruchch&#363;ram, who made a grant of land to the Vishnu temple at
Manimangalam. Tiruchch&#363;ram is identical with Tiruvidaich&#363;ram
about four miles south-east of Chingleput, where there is a ruined
fort, and also a Siva temple celebrated in the hymns of Tirugn&#257;na
Sambandhar, the great Saiva saint who lived in the 9th century. Local
tradition, confirmed by one of the Mackenzie manuscripts,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e485src" href="#xd21e485" name="xd21e485src">5</a>
says that this place was, during the time of the Vijayanagar King
Krishna R&#257;ya (1509&ndash;30 A.D.), ruled over by two feudal chiefs
of the Vanniya caste named K&#257;ndavar&#257;yan and
S&#275;ndavar&#257;yan. They, it is said, neglected to pay tribute to
their sovereign lord, who sent an army to exact it. The brothers proved
invincible, but one of their dancing-girls was guilty of treachery.
Acting under instructions, she poisoned K&#257;ndavar&#257;yan. His
brother S&#275;ndavar&#257;yan caught hold of her and her children, and
drowned them in the local tank. The tank and the hillock close by still
go by the name of Kuppichi kulam and Kuppichi kunru, after Kuppi the
dancing-girl. An inscription of the Vijayanagar king D&#275;va
R&#257;ya II (1419&ndash;44 A.D.) gives him the title of the lord who
took the heads of the eighteen Vanniyas.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e488src" href="#xd21e488" name="xd21e488src">6</a> This
inscription records a grant by one Muttayya N&#257;yakan, son of
M&#363;kk&#257; N&#257;yakan of Vannir&#257;ya g&#333;tram. Another
inscription,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e491src" href="#xd21e491" name=
"xd21e491src">7</a> dated 1456 A.D., states that, when one R&#257;ja
Vallabha ruled at Conjeeveram, a general, named Vanniya Chinna Pillai,
obtained a piece of land at S&#257;tt&#257;nk&#257;d near Madras.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>Reference is made by Orme<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e499src" href="#xd21e499" name="xd21e499src">8</a> to the
assistance which the Vaniah of Sevagherry gave Muhammad Y&#363;suf in
his reduction of Tinnevelly in 1757. The Vaniah here referred to is the
Zamindar of Sivagiri in the Tinnevelly district, a Vanniya by caste.
Vanniyas are mentioned in Ceylon archives. Wanni is the name of a
district in Ceylon. It is, Mr. W. Hamilton writes,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e502src" href="#xd21e502" name="xd21e502src">9</a>
&ldquo;situated towards Trincomalee in the north-east quarter. At
different periods its Wannies or princes, taking advantage of the wars
between the Candian sovereigns and their European enemies, endeavoured
to establish an authority independent of both, but they finally, after
their country had been much desolated by all parties, submitted to the
Dutch.&rdquo; Further, Sir J. E. Tennent writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e505src" href="#xd21e505" name="xd21e505src">10</a> that &ldquo;in
modern times, the Wanny was governed by native princes styled Wannyahs,
and occasionally by females with the title of Wunniches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The terms Sambhu and S&#257;mbhava R&#257;yan are connected with the
Pallis. The story goes that Agni was the original ancestor of all
kings. His son was Sambhu, whose descendants called themselves
Sambhukula, or those of the Sambhu family. Some inscriptions<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e510src" href="#xd21e510" name="xd21e510src">11</a>
of the time of the Ch&#333;la kings Kul&#333;ttunga III and R&#257;ja
R&#257;ja III record Sambukula Perum&#257;l S&#257;mbuvar&#257;yan and
Alagiya Pallavan &#274;dirili S&#333;la S&#257;mbuvar&#257;yan as
titles of local chiefs. A well-known verse of Irattayar in praise of
Conjeeveram &#274;k&#257;mran&#257;thasw&#257;mi refers to the Pallava
king as being of the Sambu race. The later descendants of the Pallavas
apparently took S&#257;mbuvar&#257;yar and its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>allied forms
as their titles, as the Pallis in Tanjore and South Arcot still do. At
Conjeeveram there lives the family of the Mah&#257;n&#257;tt&#257;r of
the Vanniyans, which calls itself &ldquo;of the family of V&#299;ra
Sambu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The name Vanniyan,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e523src" href="#xd21e523" name="xd21e523src">12</a>
seems to have been introduced by the Br&#257;hmans, possibly to gratify
the desire of the Pallis for genealogical distinction. Padaiy&#257;chi
means a soldier, and is also of late origin. That the Pallis were once
an influential and independent community may be admitted, and in their
present desire to be classed as Kshatriyas they are merely giving
expression to this belief, but, unless an entirely new meaning is to be
given to the term Kshatriya, their claim must be dismissed as absurd.
After the fall of the Pallava dynasty, the Pallis became agricultural
servants under the Vell&#257;las, and it is only since the advent of
British rule that they have begun to assert their claims to a higher
position.&rdquo; Further, Mr. W. Francis writes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e526src" href="#xd21e526" name="xd21e526src">13</a> that
&ldquo;this caste has been referred to as being one of those which are
claiming for themselves a position higher than that which Hindu society
is inclined to accord them. Their ancestors were socially superior to
themselves, but they do not content themselves with stating this, but
in places are taking to wearing the sacred thread of the twice-born,
and claim to be Kshatriyas. They have published pamphlets to prove
their descent from that caste, and they returned themselves in
thousands, especially in God&#257;vari, as Agnikula Kshatriyas or
Vannikula Kshatriyas, meaning Kshatriyas of the fire race.&rdquo;
&ldquo;As a relic,&rdquo; it has been said,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e529src" href="#xd21e529" name="xd21e529src">14</a> &ldquo;of the
origin of the Vannikula Kshatriyas from fire, the fire-pot, which comes
in procession on a fixed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href=
"#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>day during the annual festivities of
Draupadi and other goddesses, is borne on the head of a Vanniya. Also,
in dramatic plays, the king person&aelig; (<i>sic</i>) has always been
taken by a Kshatriya, who is generally a Vanniya. These peculiarities,
however, are becoming common now-a-days, when privileges peculiar to
one caste are being trenched upon by other caste men. In the Tirupporur
temple, the practice of beating the mazhu (red-hot iron) is done by a
dancing-girl serving the Vanniya caste. The privilege of treading on
the fire is also peculiar to the Vanniyas.&rdquo; It is recorded by Mr.
Francis<a class="noteref" id="xd21e538src" href="#xd21e538" name=
"xd21e538src">15</a> that, in the South Arcot district,
&ldquo;Draupadi&rsquo;s temples are very numerous, and the priest at
them is generally a Palli by caste, and Pallis take the leading part in
the ceremonies at them. Why this should be so is not clear. The Pallis
say it is because both the P&#257;ndava brothers and themselves were
born of fire, and are therefore related. Festivals to Draupadi always
involve two points of ritual&mdash;the recital or acting of a part of
the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata and a fire-walking ceremony. The first of
these is usually done by the Pallis, who are very fond of the great
epic, and many of whom know it uncommonly well. [In the city of Madras
there are several Draupadi Amman temples belonging to the Pallis. The
fire-walking ceremony cannot be observed thereat without the help of a
member of this caste, who is the first to walk over the hot ashes.]</p>
<p>K&#363;vv&#257;kkam is known for its festival to Arav&#257;n (more
correctly Ir&#257;v&#257;n) or K&#363;tt&#257;ndar, which is one of the
most popular feasts with S&#363;dras in the whole district. Arav&#257;n
was the son of Arjuna, one of the five P&#257;ndava brothers. Local
tradition says that, when the great war <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>which is described in the
Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata was about to begin, the Kauravas, the opponents
of the P&#257;ndavas, sacrificed, to bring them success, a white
elephant. The P&#257;ndavas were in despair of being able to find any
such uncommon object with which to propitiate the gods, until Arjuna
suggested that they should offer up his son Arav&#257;n. Arav&#257;n
agreed to yield his life for the good of the cause, and, when
eventually the P&#257;ndavas were victorious, he was deified for the
self-abnegation which had thus brought his side success. Since he died
in his youth, before he had been married, it is held to please him if
men, even though grown up and already wedded, come now and offer to
espouse him, and men who are afflicted with serious diseases take a vow
to marry him at his annual festival in the hope of thereby being cured.
The festival occurs in May, and for eighteen nights the
Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata is recited by a Palli, large numbers of people,
especially of that caste, assembling to hear it read. On the eighteenth
night, a wooden image of K&#363;tt&#257;ndar is taken to a tope
(grove), and seated there. This is the signal for the sacrifice of an
enormous number of fowls. Every one who comes brings one or two, and
the number killed runs literally into thousands. Such sacrifices are
most uncommon in South Arcot, though frequent enough in other parts of
the Presidency&mdash;the Ceded Districts for example&mdash;and this
instance is noteworthy. While this is going on, all the men who have
taken vows to be married to the deity appear before his image dressed
like women, make obeisance, offer to the priest (who is a Palli by
caste) a few annas, and give into his hands the t&#257;lis (marriage
badges) which they have brought with them. These the priest, as
representing the God, ties round their necks. The God is brought back
to his shrine that night, and when in front of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>building
he is hidden by a cloth being held before him. This symbolises the
sacrifice of Arav&#257;n, and the men who have just been married to him
set up loud lamentations at the death of their husband. Similar vows
are taken and ceremonies performed, it is said, at the shrines to
K&#363;tt&#257;ndar at Kottattai (two miles north-west of Porto Novo),
and &#256;divar&#257;hanattum (five miles north-west of Chidambaram),
and, in recent years, at Tiruvarkkulam (one mile east of the latter
place); other cases probably occur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pallis, Mr. Francis writes further,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e549src" href="#xd21e549" name="xd21e549src">16</a> &ldquo;as far
back as 1833 tried to procure a decree in Pondicherry, declaring that
they were not a low caste, and of late years they have, in this (South
Arcot) district, been closely bound together by an organisation managed
by one of their caste, who was a prominent person in these parts. In
South Arcot they take a somewhat higher social rank than in other
places&mdash;Tanjore, for example&mdash;and their <i>esprit de
corps</i> is now surprisingly strong. They are tending gradually to
approach the Br&#257;hmanical standard of social conduct, discouraging
adult marriage, meat-eating, and widow re-marriage, and they also
actively repress open immorality or other social sins, which might
serve to give the community a bad name. In 1904 a document came before
one of the courts, which showed that, in the year previous, the
representatives of the caste in thirty-four villages in this district
had bound themselves in writing, under penalty of excommunication, to
refrain (except with the consent of all parties) from the practices
formerly in existence of marrying two wives, and of allowing a woman to
marry again during the lifetime of her first husband. Some of the caste
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>have taken to calling themselves Vannikula
Kshatriyas or Agnikula Kshatriyas, and others even declare that they
are Br&#257;hmans. These last always wear the sacred thread, tie their
cloths in the Br&#257;hman fashion (though their women do not follow
the Br&#257;hman ladies in this matter), forbid widow remarriage, and
are vegetarians.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Some Palli Poligars have very high-sounding names, such as Agni
Kudirai Eriya R&#257;ya R&#257;vutha Minda Nainar, <i>i.e.</i>, Nainar
who conquered R&#257;ya R&#257;vutha and mounted a fire horse. This
name is said to commemorate a contest between a Palli and a
R&#257;vutha, at which the former sat on a red-hot metal horse. Further
names are S&#257;midurai Surappa Sozhaganar and Anj&#257;da Singam
(fearless lion). Some Pallis have adopted Gupta as a title.</p>
<p>A few Palli families now maintain a temple of their own, dedicated
to Sr&#299;niv&#257;sa, at the village of Kumalam in the South Arcot
district, live round the temple, and are largely dependent on it for
their livelihood. Most of them dress exactly like the temple Battars,
and a stranger would certainly take them for Battar Br&#257;hmans. Some
of them are well versed in the temple ritual, and their youths are
being taught the Sandyavandhana (morning prayer) and V&#275;das by a
Br&#257;hman priest. Ordinary Palli girls are taken by them in
marriage, but their own girls are not allowed to marry ordinary Pallis;
and, as a result of this practice of hypergamy, the Kumalam men
sometimes have to take to themselves more than one wife, in order that
their young women may be provided with husbands. These Kumalam Pallis
are regarded as priests of the Pallis, and style themselves
K&#333;vilar, or temple people. But, by other castes, they are
nicknamed Kumalam Br&#257;hmans. They claim to be Kshatriyas, and have
adopted the title R&#257;yar. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>Other titles, &ldquo;indicating authority, bravery, and
superiority,&rdquo; assumed by Pallis are N&#257;yakar, Varma,
Padaiy&#257;chi (head of an army), Kandar, Ch&#275;ra, Ch&#333;la,
P&#257;ndya, Nayanar, Udaiyar, Sambur&#257;yar, etc.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e572src" href="#xd21e572" name="xd21e572src">17</a> Still
further titles are Pillai, Reddi, Goundan, and Kavandan. Some say that
they belong to the Ch&#333;la race, and that, as such, they should be
called Chembians.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e575src" href="#xd21e575"
name="xd21e575src">18</a> Iranya Varma, the name of one of the early
Pallava kings, was returned as their caste by certain wealthy Pallis,
who also gave themselves the title of S&#333;lakanar (descendant of
Ch&#333;la kings) at the census, 1901.</p>
<p>In reply to a question by the Census Superintendent, 1891, as to the
names of the sub-divisions of the caste, it was stated that &ldquo;the
Vanniyans are either of the solar and lunar or Agnikula race, or Ruthra
Vanniyar, Krishna Vanniyar, Samboo Vanniyar, Brahma Vanniyar, and Indra
Vanniyar.&rdquo; The most important of the sub-divisions returned at
the census were Agamudaiyan, Agni, Arasu (R&#257;ja), Kshatriya,
N&#257;gavadam (cobra&rsquo;s hood, or ear ornament of that shape),
Nattam&#257;n, &#332;lai (palm leaf), Pandamuttu, and Perum&#257;l
g&#333;tra. Pandamuttu is made by Winslow to mean torches arranged so
as to represent an elephant. But the Pallis derive the name from panda
muttu, or touching the pandal, in reference to the pile of marriage
pots reaching to the top of the pandal. The lowest pot is decorated
with figures of elephants and horses. At a marriage among the
Pandamuttu Pallis, the bride and bridegroom, in token of their
Kshatriya descent, are seated on a raised dais, which represents a
simh&#257;sanam or throne. The bride wears a necklace of glass beads
with the t&#257;li, and the officiating priest is a Telugu
Br&#257;hman. Other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15"
name="pb15">15</a>]</span>sub-castes of the Pallis, recorded in the
Census Report, 1901, are Kallangi in Chingleput, bearing the title
Reddi, and Kallav&#275;li, or Kallan&rsquo;s fence, in the Madura
district. The occupational title Kottan (bricklayer) was returned by
some Pallis in Coimbatore. In the Salem district some Pallis are
divided into Anju-n&#257;l (five days) and Pannend&#363;-n&#257;l
(twelve days), according as they perform the final death ceremonies on
the fifth or twelfth day after death, to distinguish them from those
who perform them on the sixteenth day.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e582src" href="#xd21e582" name="xd21e582src">19</a> Another
division of Pallis in the Salem district is based on the kind of ear
ornament which is worn. The &#332;lai Pallis wear a circular ornament
(&#333;lai), and the N&#257;gavadam Pallis wear an ornament in shape
like a cobra and called n&#257;gavadam.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Mannarsw&#257;mi in front of shrine.</p>
</div>
<p>The Pallis are classed with the left-hand section. But the Census
Superintendent, 1871, records that &ldquo;the wives of the agricultural
labourers (Pallis) side with the left hand, while the husbands help in
fighting the battles of the right; and the shoe-makers&rsquo;
(Chakkiliyan) wives also take the side opposed to their husbands.
During these factional disturbances, the ladies deny to their husbands
all the privileges of the connubial state.&rdquo; This has not,
however, been confirmed in recent investigations into the customs of
the caste.</p>
<p>The Pallis are Saivites or Vaishnavites, but are also demonolaters,
and worship Muty&#257;lamma, M&#257;riamma, Ayanar, Mun&#275;swara,
Ank&#257;lamma, and other minor deities. Writing nearly a century ago
concerning the Vana Pallis settled at Kolar in Mysore, Buchanan
states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e594src" href="#xd21e594" name=
"xd21e594src">20</a> that &ldquo;they are much addicted to the worship
of the saktis, or destructive powers, and endeavour to avert their
wrath by bloody sacrifices. These are performed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>by
cutting off the animal&rsquo;s head before the door of the temple, and
invoking the deity to partake of the sacrifice. There is no altar, nor
is the blood sprinkled on the image, and the body serves the votaries
for a feast. The Palliv&#257;nlu have temples dedicated to a female
spirit of this kind named Mutialamma, and served by p&#363;j&#257;ris
(priests) of their own caste. They also offer sacrifices to
M&#257;riamma, whose p&#363;j&#257;ris are Kurubaru.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="figureHead">Palli p&#363; karagam.</p>

<p>Huge human figures, representing Mannarsw&#257;mi in a sitting
posture, constructed of bricks and mortar, and painted, are conspicuous
objects in the vicinity of the Lawrence Asylum Press, Mount Road, and
in the Kottaw&#257;l bazar, Madras. At the village of
Tirumalav&#257;yal near &#256;vadi, there is a similar figure as tall
as a palmyra palm, with a shrine of Pachaiamman close by.
Mannarsw&#257;mi is worshipped mainly by Pallis and B&#275;ri Chettis.
An annual festival is held in honour of Pachaiamman and
Mannarsw&#257;mi, in which the B&#275;ri Chettis take a prominent
part.</p>
<p>During the festivals of village deities, the goddess is frequently
represented by a pile of seven pots, called karagam, decorated with
garlands and flowers. Even when there is an idol in the temple, the
karagam is set up in a corner thereof, and taken daily, morning and
evening, in procession, carried on the head of a p&#363;j&#257;ri or
other person. On the last day of the festival, the karagam is
elaborately decorated with parrots, dolls, flowers, etc., made of pith
(<i>&AElig;schynomene aspera</i>), and called pu karagam (flower
pot).</p>
<p>The Pallis live in separate streets or quarters distinctively known
as the Palli teru or Kudi teru (ryots&rsquo; quarter). The bulk of them
are labourers, but many now farm their own lands, while others are
engaged in trade or in Government service. The occupations of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=

Chingleput were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Some of the Chingleput Palli men were tattooed, like the Irulas,
with a dot or vertical stripe on the forehead. Some Irulas, it may be
noted <i>en passant</i>, call themselves T&#275;n (honey) Vanniyans, or
Vana (forest) Pallis.</p>
<p>Like many other castes, the Pallis have their own caste beggars,
called N&#333;kkan, who receive presents at marriages and on other
occasions. The time-honoured panch&#257;yat system still prevails, and
the caste has headmen, entitled Perithanakk&#257;ran or
N&#257;ttamaikk&#257;ran, who decide all social matters affecting the
community, and must be present at the ceremonial distribution of
p&#257;nsup&#257;ri.</p>
<p>The K&#333;vilars, and some others who aspire to a high social
status, practice infant marriage, but adult marriage is the rule. At
the betrothal ceremony, the future bridegroom goes to the house of his
prospective father-in-law, where the headman of the future bride must
be present. The bridegroom&rsquo;s headman or father places on a tray
betel, flowers, the bride-price (pariyam) in money or jewels, the milk
money (mulap&#257;l k&#363;li), and a cocoanut. Milk money is the
present given to the mother of the bride, in return for her having
given nourishment to the girl during her infancy. All these things are
handed by the bridegroom&rsquo;s headman to the father or headman
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>of the bride, saying &ldquo;The money is yours.
The girl is ours.&rdquo; The bride&rsquo;s father, receiving them, says
&ldquo;The money is mine. The girl is yours.&rdquo; This performance is
repeated thrice, and p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri is distributed, the first
recipient being the maternal uncle. The ceremony is in a way binding,
and marriage, as a rule, follows close on the betrothal. If, in the
interval, a girl&rsquo;s intended husband dies, she may marry some one
else. A girl may not marry without the consent of her maternal uncle,
and, if he disapproves of a match, he has the right to carry her off
even when the ceremony is in progress, and marry her to a man of his
selection. It is stated, in the Vannikula Vilakkam, that at a marriage
among the Pallis &ldquo;the bride, after her betrothal, is asked to
touch the bow and sword of the bridegroom. The latter adorns himself
with all regal pomp, and, mounting a horse, goes in procession to the
bride&rsquo;s house where the marriage ceremony is
celebrated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The marriage ceremony is, in ordinary cases, completed in one day,
but the tendency is to spread it over three days, and introduce the
standard Pur&#257;nic form of ritual. On the day preceding the
wedding-day, the bride is brought in procession to the house of the
bridegroom, and the marriage pots are brought by a woman of the potter
caste. On the wedding morning, the marriage dais is got ready, and the
milk-post, pots, and lights are placed thereon. Bride and bridegroom go
separately through the nalagu ceremony. They are seated on a plank, and
five women smear them with oil by means of a culm of grass (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Cynodon Dactylon</i>), and afterwards with <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Phaseolus Mungo</i> (green gram) paste. Water coloured with
turmeric and chun&#257;m (&#257;rathi) is then waved round them, to
avert the evil eye, and they are conducted to the bathing-place. While
they are bathing, five small <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href=
"#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>cakes are placed on various parts of
the body&mdash;knees, shoulders, head, etc. When the bridegroom is
about to leave the spot, cooked rice, contained in a sieve, is waved
before him, and thrown away. The bridal couple are next taken three
times round the dais, and they offer pongal (cooked rice) to the
village and house gods and the ancestors, in five pots, in which the
rice has been very carefully prepared, so as to avoid pollution of any
kind, by a woman who has given birth to a first child. They then dress
themselves in their wedding finery, and get ready for the tying of the
t&#257;li. Meanwhile, the milk-post, made of <i lang="la-x-bio">Odina
Wodier</i>, <i lang="la-x-bio">Erythrina indica</i>, or the handle of a
plough, has been set up. At its side are placed a grindstone, a large
pot, and two lamps called kuda-vilakku (pot light) and alankara-vilakku
(ornamental light). The former consists of a lighted wick in an
earthenware tray placed on a pot, and the latter of a wooden stand with
several branches supporting a number of lamps. It is considered an
unlucky omen if the pot light goes out before the conclusion of the
ceremonial. It is stated by Mr. H. A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e675src" href="#xd21e675" name="xd21e675src">21</a> that in the
North Arcot district &ldquo;in the marriage ceremony of the Vanniyans
or Pallis, the first of the posts supporting the booth must be cut from
the vanni (<i lang="la-x-bio">Prosopis spicigera</i>), a tree which
they hold in much reverence because they believe that the five Pandava
Princes, who were like themselves Kshatriyas, during the last year of
their wanderings, deposited their arms in a tree of this species. On
the tree the arms turned into snakes, and remained untouched till the
owners&rsquo; return.&rdquo; The <i>Prosopis</i> tree is worshipped in
order to obtain pardon from sins, success over enemies, and the
realisation of the devotee&rsquo;s wishes.</p>

<p>When the bride and bridegroom come to the wedding booth dressed in
their new clothes, the Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit gives them the threads
(kankanam), which are to be tied round their wrists. The t&#257;li is
passed round to be blessed by those assembled, and handed to the
bridegroom, who ties it on the bride&rsquo;s neck. While he is so
doing, his sister holds a light called Kam&#257;kshi vilakku.
Kam&#257;kshi, the goddess at Conjeeveram, is a synonym for
Siva&rsquo;s consort Parvathi. The music of the flute is sometimes
accompanied by the blowing of the conch shell while the t&#257;li is
being tied, and omens are taken from the sounds produced thereby. The
t&#257;li-tying ceremony concluded, the couple change their seats, and
the ends of their clothes are tied together. Rice is thrown on their
heads, and in front of them, and the near relations may tie gold or
silver plates called pattam. The first to do this is the maternal
uncle. Bride and bridegroom then go round the dais and milk-post, and,
at the end of the second turn, the bridegroom lifts the bride&rsquo;s
left foot, and places it on the grindstone. At the end of the third
turn, the brother-in-law, in like manner, places the bridegroom&rsquo;s
left foot on the stone, and puts on a toe-ring. For so doing, he
receives a rupee and betel. The contracting couple are then shown the
pole-star (Arundhati), and milk and fruit are given to them. Towards
evening, the wrist-threads are removed, and they proceed to a tank for
a mock ploughing ceremony. The bridegroom carries a ploughshare, and
the bride a small pot containing conji (rice gruel). A small patch of
ground is turned up, and puddled so as to resemble a miniature field,
wherein the bridegroom plants some grain seedlings. A miniature
Pillayar (Gan&#275;sa) is made with cow-dung, and betel offered to it.
The bridegroom then sits down, feigning fatigue, and the bride gives
him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>a handful of rice, which his brother-in-law tries
to prevent him from eating. The newly-married couple remain for about a
week at the bride&rsquo;s house, and are then conducted to that of the
bridegroom, the brother-in-law carrying a hundred or a hundred and ten
cakes. Before they enter the house, coloured water and a cocoanut are
waved in front of them, and, as soon as she puts foot within her new
home, the bride must touch pots containing rice and salt with her right
hand. A curious custom among the Pallis at Kumbak&#333;nam is that the
bride&rsquo;s mother, and often all her relatives, are debarred from
attending her marriage. The bride is also kept g&#333;sha (in
seclusion) for all the days of the wedding.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e694src" href="#xd21e694" name="xd21e694src">22</a></p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. Hemingway that some of the Pandamuttu Pallis of
the Trichinopoly district &ldquo;practice the betrothal of infant
girls, the ceremony consisting of pouring cow-dung water into the mouth
of the baby. They allow a girl to marry a boy younger than herself, and
make the latter swallow a two-anna bit, to neutralise the disadvantages
of such a match. Weddings are generally performed at the boy&rsquo;s
house, and the bride&rsquo;s mother does not attend. The bride is
concealed from view by a screen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said that, some years ago, a marriage took place at Panruti
near Cuddalore on the old Svayamvara principle described in the story
of Nala and Damayanti in the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata. According to this
custom, a girl selects a husband from a large number of competitors,
who are assembled for the purpose.</p>
<p>Widow remarriage is permitted. At the marriage of a widow, the
t&#257;li is tied by a married woman, the bridegroom standing by the
side, usually inside the house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22"
href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>Widow marriage is known as
naduvittu t&#257;li, as the t&#257;li-tying ceremony takes place within
the house (naduv&#299;du).</p>
<p>To get rid of the pollution of the first menstrual period, holy
water is sprinkled over the girl by a Br&#257;hman, after she has
bathed. She seats herself on a plank, and rice cakes (puttu), a
pounding stone, and &#257;rathi are waved in front of her. Sugar and
betel are then distributed among those present.</p>
<p>The dead are sometimes burnt, and sometimes buried. As soon as an
individual dies, the son goes three times round the corpse, carrying an
iron measure (marakkal), wherein a lamp rests on unhusked rice. The
corpse is washed, and the widow bathes in such a way that the water
falls on it. Omission to perform this rite would entail disgrace, and
there is an abusive phrase &ldquo;May the water from the woman&rsquo;s
body not fall on that of the corpse.&rdquo; The dead man and his widow
exchange betel three times. The corpse is carried to the burning or
burial-ground on a bamboo stretcher, and, on the way thither, is set
down near a stone representing Arichandra, to whom food is offered.
Arichandra was a king who became a slave of the Paraiyans, and is in
charge of the burial-ground. By some Pallis a two-anna piece is placed
on the forehead, and a pot of rice on the breast of the corpse. These
are taken away by the officiating barber and Paraiyan
respectively.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e710src" href="#xd21e710" name=

through a <i>post-mortem</i> mock marriage ceremony. A garland of arka
(<i>Calotropis gigantea</i>) flowers is placed round the neck of the
corpse, and mud from a gutter is shaped into cakes, which, like the
cakes at a real marriage, are placed on various parts of the body.

<p>A curious death ceremony is said by Mr. Hemingway to be observed by
the Arasu Pallis in the Trichinopoly district. On the day after the
funeral, two pots of water are placed near the spot where the corpse
was cremated. If a cow drinks of the water, they think it is the soul
of the dead come to quench its thirst.</p>
<p>In some places, Palli women live in strict seclusion (G&#333;sha).
This is particularly the case in the old Palaigar families of
Ariyal&#363;r, Udaiyarp&#257;laiyam, Pichavaram, and Sivagiri.</p>
<p>The caste has a well-organised Sangham (association) called Chennai
Vannikula Kshatriya Mah&#257; Sangham, which was established in 1888 by
leaders of the caste. Besides creating a strong <i>esprit de corps</i>
among members of the caste in various parts of the Madras Presidency,
it has been instrumental in the opening of seven schools, of which
three are in Madras, and the others at Conjeeveram, Madhurantakam,
Tirukalikundram and Kumalam. It has also established chuttrams
(rest-houses) at five places of pilgrimage. Chengalvar&#257;ya
N&#257;yakar&rsquo;s Technical School, attached to Pachaiappa&rsquo;s
College in Madras, was founded in 1865 by a member of the Palli caste,
who bequeathed a large legacy for its maintenance. There is also an
orphanage named after him in Madras, for Palli boys. G&#333;vindappa
N&#257;yakar&rsquo;s School, which forms the lower secondary branch of
Pachaiappa&rsquo;s College, is another institution which owes its
existence to the munificence of a member of the Palli caste. The latest
venture of the Pallis is the publication of a newspaper called
Agnikuladittan (the sun of the Agnikula), which was started in
1908.</p>
<p>Concerning the Pallis, Pallilu, or Palles, who are settled in the
Telugu country as fishermen, carpenters, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>and agriculturists, Mr.
H. A. Stuart writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e733src" href="#xd21e733"
name="xd21e733src">24</a> that &ldquo;it seems probable that they are a
branch of the great Palli or Vanniya tribe, for Buchanan refers to the
M&#299;na (fish) Pallis and Vana Pallis.&rdquo; As sub-castes of these
Pallis, Vada (boatmen), Marakk&#257;du and &#274;dakula are given in
the Census Report, 1901. In the North Arcot Manual, Palli is given as a
sub-division of the Telugu K&#257;pus. In some places the Pallis call
themselves Palle K&#257;pulu, and give as their g&#333;tram
Jambum&#257;harishi, which is a g&#333;tram of the Pallis. Though they
do not intermarry, the Palle K&#257;pulu may interdine with the
K&#257;pus.</p>
<p>Concerning the caste-beggars of the Pallis, and their legendary
history, I read the following account.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e738src" href="#xd21e738" name="xd21e738src">25</a> &ldquo;I came
upon a noisy procession entering one of the main streets of a town not
far from Madras. It was headed by spearmen, swordsmen, and
banner-bearers, the last carrying huge flags (palempores) with
representations of lions, tigers, monkeys, Brahmany kites, goblins and
dwarfs. The centre of attraction consisted of some half dozen men and
women in all the bravery of painted faces and gay clothing, and armed
with swords, lances, and daggers. Tom-toms, trumpets, cymbals, and
horns furnished the usual concomitant of ear-piercing music, while the
painted men and women moved, in time with it, their hands and feet,
which were encircled by rows of tiny bells. A motley following of the
tag-rag and bob-tail of the population, which had been allured thither
by the noise and clamour, brought up the rear of the procession, which
stopped at each crossing. At each halt, the trumpeters blew a great and
sonorous blast, while one of the central figures, with a conspicuous
abdominal development, stepped forward, and, in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>stentorian voice, proclaimed the brave deeds
performed by them in the days gone by, and challenged all comers to try
conclusions with them, or own themselves beaten. I was told that the
chief personages in the show were J&#257;tipillays (literally, children
of the caste), who had arrived in the town in the course of their
annual tour of the country, for collecting their perquisites from all
members of the Palli or Padi&#257;chi caste, and that this was how they
announced their arrival. The perquisite levied is known as the
talaikattu vari (poll-tax, or literally the turban tax), a significant
expression when it is borne in mind that only the adult male members of
the caste (those who are entitled to tie a cloth round their heads) are
liable to pay it, and not the women and children. It amounts to but one
anna per head, and is easily collected. The J&#257;tipillays also claim
occult powers, and undertake to exhibit their skill in magic by the
exorcism of devils, witchcraft and sorcery, and the removal of spells,
however potent. This operation is called modi edukkirathu, or the
breaking of spells, and sometimes the challenge is taken up by a rival
magician of a different caste. A wager is fixed, and won or lost
according to the superior skill of the challenger or challenged.
Entering into friendly chat with one of the leading members of the
class, I gleaned the following legend of its origin, and of the homage
accorded to it by the Pallis. In remote times, when Salivahana was king
of the Ch&#333;la country, with its capital at Conjeeveram, all the
principal castes of South India had their head-quarters at the seat of
government, where each, after its own way, did homage to the triple
deities of the place, namely, Kamakshi Amman, Ekambrasvarar, and Sri
Varadar&#257;jasw&#257;mi. Each caste got up an annual car festival to
these deities. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>On one of these occasions, owing to a difference
which had arisen between the Seniyans (weavers), who form a
considerable portion of the population of Conjeeveram, on one side, and
the Pallis or Vanniyans on the other, some members of the former caste,
who were adepts in magic, through sheer malevolence worked spells upon
the cars of the Pallis, whose progress through the streets first became
slow and tedious, and was finally completely arrested, the whole lot of
them having come to a stand-still, and remaining rooted on the spot in
one of the much frequented thoroughfares of the city. The Pallis put on
more men to draw the cars, and even employed elephants and horses to
haul them, but all to no purpose. As if even this was not sufficient to
satisfy their malignity, the unscrupulous Seniyars actually went to
King Salivahana, and bitterly complained against the Pallis of having
caused a public nuisance by leaving their cars in a common highway to
the detriment of the public traffic. The king summoned the Pallis, and
called them to account, but they pleaded that it was through no fault
of theirs that the cars had stuck in a thoroughfare, that they had not
been negligent, but had essayed all possible methods of hauling them to
their destination by adding to the number of men employed in pulling
them, and by having further tried to accelerate their progress with the
aid of elephants, camels, and horses, but all in vain. They further
declared their conviction that the Seniyars had played them an
ill-turn, and placed the cars under a spell. King Salivahana, however,
turned a deaf ear to these representations, and decreed that it was
open to the Pallis to counteract the spells of their adversaries, and
he prescribed a period within which this was to be effected. He also
tacked on a threat that, in default of compliance with his mandate, the
Pallis must leave his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27"
name="pb27">27</a>]</span>kingdom for good and ever. The Pallis sought
refuge and protection of the goddess Kamakshi Amman, whose pity was
touched by their sad plight, and who came to their aid. She appeared to
one of the elders of the caste in a dream, and revealed to him that
there was a staunch devotee of hers&mdash;a member of their
caste&mdash;who alone could remove the spells wrought by the Seniyars,
and that this man, Ramasawmy Naikan, was Prime Minister in the service
of the Kodagu (Coorg) R&#257;ja. The desperate plight they were in
induced the Pallis to send a powerful deputation to the R&#257;ja, and
to beg of him to lend them the services of Ramasawmy Naik, in order to
save them from the catastrophe which was imminent. The R&#257;ja was
kind enough to comply. The Naik arrived, and, by virtue of his
clairvoyant powers, took in the situation at a glance. He found myriads
of imps and uncanny beings around each of the car-wheels, who gripped
them as by a vice, and pulled them back with their sinewy legs and
hands every time an attempt was made to drag them forwards. Ramasawmy
Naik by no means liked the look of things, for he found that he had all
his work cut out for him to keep these little devils from doing him
bodily harm, let alone any attempt to <span class="corr" id="xd21e747"
title="Source: caste">cast</span> them off by spells. He saw that more
than common powers were needed to face the situation, and prayed to
Kamakshi Amman to disclose a way of overcoming the enemy. After long
fasting and prayers, he slept a night in the temple of Kamakshi Amman,
in the hope that a revelation might come to him in his slumber. While
he slept, Kamakshi Amman appeared, and declared to him that the only
way of overcoming the foe was for the Pallis to render a propitiatory
sacrifice, but of a most revolting kind, namely, to offer up as a
victim a woman pregnant with her first <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>child. The Pallis
trembled at the enormity of the demand, and declared that they would
sooner submit to Salivahana&rsquo;s decree of perpetual exile than
offer such a horrible sacrifice. Ramasawmy Naik, however, rose to the
occasion, and resolved to sacrifice his own girl-wife, who was then
pregnant with her first child. He succeeded in propitiating the deity
by offering this heroic sacrifice, and the spells of the Seniyars
instantly collapsed, and the whole legion of imps and devils, who had
impeded the progress of the Pallis&rsquo; car, vanished into thin air.
The coast having thus been cleared of hostile influences, Ramasawmy
Naik, with no more help than his own occult powers gave him, succeeded
in hauling the whole lot of cars to their destination, and in a single
trip, by means of a rope passed through a hole in his nose. The Pallis,
whose gratitude knew no bounds, called down benedictions on his head,
and, falling prostrate before him, begged him to name his reward for
the priceless service rendered by him to their community. Ramasawmy
Naik only asked that the memory of his services to the caste might be
perpetuated by the bestowal upon him and his descendants of the title
J&#257;ti-pillay, or children of the caste, and of the privilege of
receiving alms at the hands of the Pallis; and that they might
henceforth be allowed the honour of carrying the badges of the
caste&mdash;banners, state umbrellas, trumpets, and other
paraphernalia&mdash;in proof of the signal victory they had gained over
the Seniyars.&rdquo;</p>

personify are supposed to have influence over crops, and at the time of
harvest the P&#257;n&#257;ns go about begging from house to house,
dancing with umbrellas in their hands. On such occasions, however, it
is only boys and girls who personify the demons.&rdquo; &ldquo;The

devils from the bodies of persons (chiefly children) possessed, in
writing charms for them to wear, removing the pernicious effects of the
evil eye, and so on.&rdquo; On certain ceremonial occasions, the
P&#257;n&#257;n plays on an hour-glass shaped drum, called thudi.</p>
<p>In an account of the funeral ceremonies of the T&#299;yans, Mr.
Logan writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e809src" href="#xd21e809" name=
"xd21e809src">27</a> that &ldquo;early on the morning of the third day
after death, the Kurup or caste barber adopts measures to entice the
spirit of the deceased out of the room in which he breathed his last.
This is done by the nearest relative bringing into the room a steaming
pot of savoury funeral rice. It is immediately removed, and the spirit,
after three days&rsquo; fasting, is understood greedily to follow the
odour of the tempting food. The Kurup at once closes the door, and
shuts out the spirit. The Kurup belongs to the P&#257;n&#257;n caste.
He is the barber of the polluting classes above Cherumans, and by
profession he is also an umbrella maker. But, curiously enough, though
an umbrella <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>maker, he cannot make the whole of an umbrella. He
may only make the framework; the covering of it is the portion of the
females of his caste. If he has no female relative of his own capable
of finishing off his umbrellas, he must seek the services of the
females of other families in the neighbourhood to finish his for him.
The basket-makers are called Kavaras. Nothing will induce them to take
hold of an umbrella, as they have a motto, Do not take hold of
P&#257;n&#257;n&rsquo;s leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an account of a ceremonial at the Pish&#257;ri temple near
Quilandy in Malabar, Mr. F. Fawcett writes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e816src" href="#xd21e816" name="xd21e816src">28</a> that
&ldquo;early on the seventh and last day, when the morning procession
is over, there comes to the temple a man of the P&#257;n&#257;n caste.
He carries a small cadjan (palm leaf) umbrella which he has made
himself, adorned all round the edges with a fringe of the young leaves
of the cocoanut palm. The umbrella should have a long handle, and with
this in his hand he performs a dance before the temple. He receives
about 10 lbs. of raw rice for his performance.&rdquo; It is further
recorded by Mr. Fawcett that, when a T&#299;yan is cremated, a watch is
kept at the burning-ground for five days by P&#257;n&#257;ns, who beat
drums all night to scare away the evil spirits which haunt such
spots.</p>
<p>The following account of the <span class="corr" id="xd21e822" title=
"Source: P&#257;nans">P&#257;n&#257;ns</span> is given in the Gazetteer
of Malabar. &ldquo;The name is perhaps connected with p&#257;n, music.
They follow the makkatt&#257;yam family system (of inheritance from
father to son), and practice fraternal polyandry. In South Malabar
there are said to be four sub-divisions, called Tirurengan,
K&#333;daketti (umbrella tying), M&#299;npidi (fish catching), and
Pulluvan, of which the last named is inferior in status to the other
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>three. They are also divided into exogamous illams
or kiriyams. They worship K&#257;li, and inferior deities such as
Parakutti, Karinkutti, Gulikan, and Kutti Ch&#257;ttan. Their methods
of exorcism are various. If any one is considered to be possessed by
demons, it is usual, after consulting the astrologer, to ascertain what
Murti (lit. form) is causing the trouble, to call in <span class="corr"
id="xd21e827" title="Source: P&#257;nans">P&#257;n&#257;ns</span>, who
perform a ceremony called Tey&#257;ttam, in which they wear masks, and,
so attired, sing, dance, tom-tom, and play on rude and strident pipes.
Other of their ceremonies for driving out devils called Ucchav&#275;li
seem to be survivals of imitations of human sacrifice, or instances of
sympathetic magic. One of these consists of a mock living burial of the
principal performer, who is placed in a pit which is covered with
planks, on the top of which a sacrifice (h&#333;mam) is performed with
a fire kindled with jack (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>) branches. In
another variety, the P&#257;nan cuts his left forearm, and smears his
face with the blood thus drawn. P&#257;nans also take part with
Mann&#257;ns in various ceremonies at Badrak&#257;li and other temples,
in which the performers personate, in suitable costumes, some of the
minor deities or demons, and fowls are sacrificed, while a
Velicchap&#257;d dances himself into a frenzy, and pronounces
oracles.&rdquo; It is further noted, in the Gazetteer of Malabar, that
&ldquo;to constitute a valid divorce, the husband pulls a thread from
his cloth, and gives it to his wife&rsquo;s brother, saying &lsquo;Your
parisha is over.&rsquo; It is a traditional duty of the P&#257;nans to
furnish a messenger to announce to an Izhuvan (or Tand&#257;n)
girl&rsquo;s mother or husband (according to where she is staying) that
she has attained puberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Census Report, 1901, Anj&#363;tt&#257;n (men of the five
hundred) and Munn&#363;tt&#257;n (men of the three <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>hundred)
are returned as sub-castes of the Malay&#257;lan P&#257;n&#257;ns.</p>
<p>For the following account of the P&#257;n&#257;ns of Travancore, I
am indebted to Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar. The word is of Tamil origin, and
means a tailor. The title taken by them is Panikkan, the usual
honorific appellation of most of the industrial castes of Malabar. They
are supposed to be one with the P&#257;n&#257;ns of the Tamil country,
though much below them in the social scale. They observe a pollution
distance of thirty-six feet, but keep Mann&#257;ns and V&#275;dans at a
distance of eight, and Pulayas and Paraiyas at a distance of thirty-two
feet from them. They are their own barbers and washermen. They will eat
food prepared by Kamm&#257;lans, of whom there is a tradition that they
are a degraded branch. Tiruvarangan, one of the popular sages of
Malabar, who are reputed to be the descendants of a Paraiya woman, is
said to have been a P&#257;n&#257;n, and the P&#257;n&#257;ns pay him
due reverence. In the K&#275;ralolpatti, the traditional occupation of
the P&#257;n&#257;ns is said to be exorcism, and in British Malabar
this occupation seems to be continued at the present day.
Umbrella-making is a secondary occupation for the men. In Travancore,
however, the only occupation pursued by the P&#257;n&#257;ns is
tailoring. The t&#257;li-kettu celebration takes place before the girl
attains puberty. If this ceremony is intended to signify a real
marriage, the girl is taken to her husband&rsquo;s house on the fourth
day of the first menstrual period, and they remain thenceforth man and
wife. Otherwise a sambandham ceremony has to be performed either by the
t&#257;li-tier or some one else, to establish conjugal relations.
Inheritance is mostly paternal. The dead are buried, and death
pollution lasts for sixteen days. The spirits of deceased ancestors are
appeased once a year by the offering of cooked food <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>on the
new-moon day in the month of Karkatakam (July-August). Ancestors who
died from some untoward accident are propitiated in the month of Avani
(August-September) by offerings of flesh and liquor. The latter
ceremonial is termed vellamkuli or water drinking. Small earthen sheds,
called gurusalas or kuriyalas and matams, are erected in memory of some
ancestors.</p>
<p>The following account of the P&#257;n&#257;ns of the Cochin State is
extracted from a note by Mr. L. K. Ananta Krishna Aiyar.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e843src" href="#xd21e843" name=
"xd21e843src">29</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The P&#257;n&#257;ns give, as the traditional account of
their origin, a distorted version of the tradition as to the origin of
the Izhuvans, which is found in the Mackenzie Manuscripts. The
P&#257;n&#257;n version of the story is as follows. One day a washerman
of Cheraman Perum&#257;l chanced to wash his dress very clean. On being
asked by the Perum&#257;l as to the cause of it, the washerman said
that it was due to the suggestion of a handsome carpenter girl, who saw
him while washing. The Perum&#257;l, pleased with the girl, desired her
to be married to his washerman. The parents of the girl were duly
consulted, and they could not refuse the offer, as it came from their
sovereign. But his fellow carpenters resented it, for, if the proposal
was accepted, and the marriage celebrated, it might not only place the
members of her family under a ban, but would also bring dishonour to
the castemen. To avert the contemplated union, they resorted to the
following device. A pandal (marriage booth) was erected and tastefully
decorated. Just at the auspicious hour, when the bridegroom and his
party were properly seated on mats in the pandal, the carpenters
brought a puppet exactly resembling the bride, and placed it by his
side, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>when suddenly, by a clever artifice, the
carpenters caused the building to tumble down, and thereby killed all
those who were in it. They immediately left the Perum&#257;l&rsquo;s
country, and took refuge in the island of Ceylon. The ruler was much
embarrassed by the disaster to the washerman, and by the flight of the
carpenters, for he had none in his country to build houses. A few
P&#257;n&#257;ns were sent for, and they brought the carpenters back.
On their return, they were given some fruit of the palmyra palm, which
they ate. They sowed the seeds in their own places, and these grew into
large fruit-bearing palms. The P&#257;n&#257;ns possessed the privilege
of keeping these trees as their own, but subsequently made them over to
the Izhuvans, who, in memory of this, give even to-day two dishes of
food to the P&#257;n&#257;ns on all ceremonial occasions in their
houses. They have been, on that account, called by the Izhuvans
nettaries, for their having originally planted these trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no titles among the P&#257;n&#257;ns, but one, who
was brought for examination at Trich&#363;r, told me that one of his
ancestors got the title of Panikkan, and that he had the privilege of
wearing a gold ear-ring, carrying a walking-stick lined with silver,
and using a knife provided with a style. Kapradan is a title given to
the headman in the Palghat taluk. In Palghat, when the Kapradan dies,
the R&#257;ja is informed, and he sends to the chief mourner (the son)
a sword, a shield, a spear, a few small guns with some gunpowder, a
silver bangle, and a few necklaces. As the dead body is taken to the
burial ground, the chief mourner, wearing the ornaments above
mentioned, goes behind it. In front go a few persons armed with the
weapons referred to. Three discharges are made (1) when the dead body
is removed from the house, (2) when it is placed on the ground, (3)
when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>it is burnt. The next day, the chief mourner pays
his respects to the R&#257;ja, with an umbrella of his own making, when
the R&#257;ja bestows upon him the title of Kapradan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are magicians and sorcerers among the P&#257;n&#257;ns,
who sometimes, at the request even of the high-caste men, practice the
black art. Some of the P&#257;n&#257;ns, like the Parayans, engage in
magical rites of a repulsive nature, in order to become possessors of a
powerful medicine, the possession of which is believed to confer the
power of obtaining anything he wishes. They also believe in the
existence of a demoniacal hierarchy. Changili Karuppan, Pechi, Oodara
Karuppan, K&#257;li, Chotala Karuppan, Chotala Bhadrak&#257;li, Yakshi,
Gandharvan, and Hanum&#257;n are the names of the chief demons whom
they profess to control with the aid of mantrams (consecrated
formul&aelig;) and offerings. They also profess that they can send one
or more of these demons into the bodies of men, and cast them out when
persons are possessed of them. They profess to cure all kinds of
diseases in children with the aid of magic and medicines, and all the
castemen believe that harm or even death may be caused to men with the
aid of sorcerers. In such cases, an astrologer is consulted, and,
according to his calculations, the aid of a magician is sought for.
When a person is suffering from what are believed to be demoniacal
attacks, he is relieved by the performance of the following ceremony,
called pathalah&#333;mam. A pit about six feet in length, three feet in
depth, and a foot or two in breadth, is dug. A P&#257;n&#257;n, covered
with a new piece of cloth, is made to lie in the pit, which is filled
in with earth, leaving a small hole for him to breathe. Over the middle
of his body, the earth is raised and made level. A sacred fire
(h&#333;mam) is made over this with the branches of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>jack
tree. Near it a large square is drawn with sixty-four small divisions,
in each of which a small leaf, with some paddy (unhusked rice), rice,
flour, and lighted torches, is placed. Gingelly (<i>Sesamum</i>) seeds,
mustard seeds, grains of chama (<i lang="la-x-bio">Panicum
miliaceum</i>), horse gram (<i lang="la-x-bio">Dolichos biflorus</i>),
eight fragrant things, the skin of snakes, dung of the elephant, milk
of the pala tree, twigs of the banyan tree, dharba grass, nila narakam
(<i>Naregamia alata</i>) oil, and ghee (clarified butter) are put into
it until it burns bright. The sick man is brought in front of it, and
the sorcerer authoritatively asks him&mdash;or rather the demon
residing in his body&mdash;to take these things. The sorcerer puts the
above mentioned substances into the fire, muttering all the while his
mantrams invoking the favour of V&#299;ra Bhadra or Kandakaruna. The
significance of these is &lsquo;Oh! Kandakaruna, the King of the
D&#275;vas, I have no body, that is, my body is getting weaker and
weaker, and am possessed of some demon, which is killing me, kindly
help me, and give me strength.&rsquo; This done, another operation is
begun. A fowl is buried, and a small portion of the earth above it is
raised and made level. The figure of a man is drawn by the side of it.
Three h&#333;mams (sacred fires) are raised, one at the head, one in
the middle, and one at the feet. The above mentioned grains, and other
substances, are put into the fire. A large square with sixty-four
smaller squares in it is drawn, in each of which a leaf, with grains of
paddy, rice, and flowers, is placed. Another mantram in praise of the
demons already mentioned is uttered, and a song is sung. After
finishing this, a small structure in the form of a temple is made. A
small plantain tree is placed by the side of it. A padmam is drawn, and
a p&#363;ja (worship) is performed for the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>Parad&#275;vatha, the queen of demons. The
sorcerer makes offerings of toddy, beaten rice, plantains, and
cocoanuts, and soon turns oracle, and, as one inspired, tells what the
deity wishes, and gives information as regards the departure of the
demons from the body. It is now believed that the patient is free from
all demoniacal attacks. The buried man is exhumed, and allowed to go
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Palghat t&#257;luk, the following form of sorcery is
practiced, which is believed to relieve persons from demoniacal attacks
and disease. If, in the house of any casteman, it is suspected that
some malign influence is being exercised by demons, a P&#257;n&#257;n
is sent for, who comes in the evening with his colleagues. A h&#333;mam
is lighted with the branches of the trees already mentioned, and into
it are thrown six kinds of grains, as well as oil and ghee. As this is
being done, Kallatikode Nili, the presiding archdemon, is propitiated
with songs and offerings. The next part of the ceremony consists in
bringing a bier and placing a P&#257;n&#257;n on it, and a measure of
rice is placed at his head. He is, as in the case of a dead body,
covered with a piece of new cloth, and a small plantain tree is placed
between the thighs. At his head a sheep and at his feet a fowl are
killed. He pretends gradually to recover consciousness. In this state
he is taken outside the compound. The P&#257;n&#257;n, lying on the
bier, evidently pretends to be dead, as if killed by the attack of some
demon. The propitiation with songs and offerings is intended to gratify
the demons. This is an instance of sympathetic magic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some among the P&#257;n&#257;ns practice the oti (or odi)
cult, like the Parayas. The following medicines, with the aid of magic,
are serviceable to them in enticing pregnant women from their houses.
Their preparation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39"
name="pb39">39</a>]</span>is described as follows. A P&#257;n&#257;n,
who is an adept in the black art, bathes early in the morning, dresses
in a cloth unwashed, and performs p&#363;ja to his deity, after which
he goes in search of a Kotuveli plant (<i>Manihot utilissima</i>). When
he finds such a one as he wants, he goes round it three times every
day, and continues to do so for ninety days, prostrating himself every
day before it. On the last night, which must be a new-moon night, at
twelve o&rsquo;clock he performs p&#363;ja to the plant, burning
camphor, and, after going round it three times, prostrates himself
before it. He then places three small torches on it, and advances
twenty paces in front of it. With his mouth closed, and without any
fear, he plucks the plant by the root, and buries it in the ashes on
the cremation ground, on which he pours the water of seven green
cocoanuts. He then goes round it twenty-one times, muttering all the
while certain mantrams, after which he plunges himself in the water,
and stands erect until it extends to his mouth. He takes a mouthful of
water, which he empties on the spot, and then takes the plant with the
root, which he believes to possess peculiar virtues. When it is taken
to the closed door of a house, it has the power to entice a pregnant
woman, when the f&oelig;tus is removed (<i>cf.</i> article Parayan). It
is all secretly done on a dark midnight. The head, hands and legs are
cut off, and the trunk is taken to a dark-coloured rock, on which it is
cut into nine pieces, which are all burned until they are blackened. At
this stage, one piece boils, and is placed in a new earthen pot, with
the addition of the water of nine green cocoanuts. The pot is removed
to the burial-ground. The P&#257;n&#257;n performs a p&#363;ja here in
favour of his favourite deity. Here he fixes two poles deep in the
earth, at a distance of thirty feet from each other. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span></p>
<p>The poles are connected by a strong wire, from which is suspended
the pot to be heated and boiled. Seven fire-places are made, beneath
the wire. The branches of bamboo, katalati (<i>Achyranthes
Emblica</i>), conga (<i>Bauhinea variegata</i>), cocoanut palm, jack
tree (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>), and pavatta (<i>Pavatta
indica</i>), are used in forming a bright fire. The mixture in the pot
soon boils and becomes oily, at which stage it is passed through a fine
cloth. The oil is preserved, and a mark made with it on the forehead
enables the possessor to realise anything that is thought of. The
sorcerer must be in a state of vow for twenty-one days, and live on a
diet of chama kanji. The deity, whose aid is necessary, is propitiated
with offerings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the ceremonies which the P&#257;n&#257;ns perform is
called Thukil Onarthuka (waking thukil, a kind of drum). In the month
of Karkadakam (July-August), a P&#257;n&#257;n, with his wife, provided
with a drum and kuzhithalam (circular bell-metal cymbals), goes to the
houses of Br&#257;hmans and N&#257;yars after midnight, and sings
sacred songs. During the week, they sing standing underneath a banyan
tree near the western gate of the Trich&#363;r temple. From the temple
authorities they get five measures of paddy, half a measure of rice,
some gingelly oil, and a cocoanut. For their services in other houses,
they receive a similar remuneration. This is intended to drive evil
spirits, if any, from houses. Another of their festivals is known as
P&#257;n&#257;n Kali. The traditional account therefor is as follows.
Once, when a P&#257;n&#257;n and his wife went to a forest to bring
bamboos for the manufacture of umbrellas, they missed their way, night
approached, and they could not return. They began to be frightened by
the varieties of noise heard by them in the wilderness. They collected
pieces <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>of dry bamboo and leaves of trees, and burned
them. In the presence of the light thus obtained, the woman caught hold
of a creeper hanging from a tree, and danced in honour of Bhagavathi,
while her husband sang songs praising her. The day dawned at last, and
they found their way home in safety. In memory of this incident, the
P&#257;n&#257;ns organise a party for a regular play. There are ten
male and two female actors, and the play is acted during the whole
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The religion of the P&#257;n&#257;ns consists of an
all-pervading demonology. Their chief gods are Mukkan, Ch&#257;than,
Kappiri, Malankorathi, and Kali. P&#363;jas are performed to them on
the first of Medom (April-May), Karkadakam (July-August), Desara, and
on Tuesday in Makaram (January-February). These deities are represented
by stones placed under a tree. They are washed with water on the
aforesaid days, and offerings of sheep and fowls, malar (parched rice),
plantains, cocoanuts, and boiled rice are made to them. Their belief is
that these deities are ever prone to do harm to them, and should
therefore be propitiated with offerings. The P&#257;n&#257;ns also
worship the spirits of their ancestors, who pass for their household
gods, and whose help they seek in all times of danger. They fast on
new-moon nights, and on the eleventh night after full-moon or
new-moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The P&#257;n&#257;n is the barber of the polluting castes
above Cherumans. By profession he is an umbrella-maker.
P&#257;n&#257;ns are also engaged in all kinds of agricultural work. In
villages, they build mud walls. Their women act as midwives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As regards social status, the P&#257;n&#257;ns eat at the
hands of Br&#257;hmans, N&#257;yars, Kamm&#257;lans, and Izhuvans. They
have to stand at a distance of thirty-two feet from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>Br&#257;hmans. P&#257;n&#257;ns and Kaniyans
pollute one another if they touch, and both bathe should they happen to
do so. They are their own barbers and washermen. They live in the
vicinity of the Izhuvans, but cannot live in the N&#257;yar tharas. Nor
can they take water from the wells of the Kamm&#257;lans. They cannot
approach the outer walls of Br&#257;hman temples, and are not allowed
to enter the Br&#257;hman streets in Palghat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Census Report, 1891, P&#257;n&#257;n occurs as a sub-division
of the Paraiyans. Their chief occupation as leather-workers is said to
be the manufacture of drum-heads.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e915src"

<p><b>Panasa.&mdash;</b>The Panasas are a class of beggars in the
Telugu country, who are said to ask alms only from Kamsalas. The word
panasa means constant repetition of words, and, in its application to
the Panasa, probably indicates that they, like the Bhatr&#257;zu bards
and panegyrists, make up verses eulogising those from whom they beg. It
is stated in the Kurnool Manual (1886) that &ldquo;they take alms from
the B&#275;ri K&#333;matis and goldsmiths (Kamsalas), and no others.
The story goes that, in Golkonda, a tribe of K&#333;matis named
Bacheluv&#257;ru were imprisoned for non-payment of arrears of revenue.
Finding certain men of the artificer class who passed by in the street
spit betel nut, they got it into their mouths, and begged the
artificers to get them released. The artificers, pitying them, paid the
arrears, and procured their release. It was then that the Kamsalis
fixed a vartana or annual house-fee for the maintenance of the Panasa
class, on condition that they should not beg alms from the other
castes.&rdquo; The Panasas appear every year in the Kurnool district to
collect their dues. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43"
name="pb43">43</a>]</span></p>
<p><b>P&#257;ncha.&mdash;</b>P&#257;ncha, meaning five, is recorded as
a sub-division of the Linga Balijas, and P&#257;nchach&#257;ra or
P&#257;nchams&#257;le as a sub-division of Ling&#257;yats. In all
these, p&#257;ncha has reference to the five &#257;charas or ceremonial
observances of the Ling&#257;yats, which seem to vary according to
locality. Wearing the lingam, worshipping it before meals, and paying
reverence to the Jangam priests, are included among the
observances.</p>
<p><b>P&#257;nch&#257;la.&mdash;</b>A synonym for Canarese
Kamm&#257;lans, among whom five (p&#257;nch) classes of workers are
included, viz., gold and silver, brass and copper, iron, and stone.</p>
<p><b>P&#257;nchalinga</b> (five lingams).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
B&#333;ya. The lingam is the symbol of Siva.</p>
<p><b>Panchama.&mdash;</b>The Panchamas are, in the Madras Census
Report, 1871, summed up as being &ldquo;that great division of the
people, spoken of by themselves as the fifth caste, and described by
Buchanan and other writers as the Pancham Bandam.&rdquo; According to
Buchanan,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e942src" href="#xd21e942" name=
"xd21e942src">31</a> the Pancham Bandum &ldquo;consist of four tribes,
the Parriar, the Baluan, the Shekliar, and the Toti.&rdquo; Buchanan
further makes mention of Panchama Banijigaru and Panchama Cumbharu
(potters). The Panchamas were, in the Department of Public Instruction,
called &ldquo;Paraiyas and kindred classes&rdquo; till 1893. This
classification was replaced, for convenience of reference, by Panchama,
which included Chacchadis, God&#257;ris, Pulayas, Holeyas,
M&#257;digas, M&#257;las, Pallans, Paraiyans, Totis, and Valluvans.
&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; the Director of Public Instruction wrote in 1902,
&ldquo;for Government to consider whether the various classes concerned
should, for the sake of brevity, be described by one simple name. The
terms Paraiya, low caste, outcaste, carry with them a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>derogatory meaning, and are unsuitable. The
expression Pancham Banda, or more briefly Panchama, seems more
appropriate.&rdquo; The Government ruled that there is no objection to
the proposal that Paraiyas and kindred classes should be designated
Panchama Bandham or Panchama in future, but it would be simpler to
style them the fifth class.</p>
<p>The following educational privileges according to the various
classes classified as Panchama may be noted:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) They are admitted into schools at half the standard rates of
fees.</p>
<p>(2) Under the result grant system (recently abolished), grants were
passed for Panchama pupils at rates 50 per cent. higher than in
ordinary cases, and 15 per cent. higher in backward localities.</p>
<p>(3) Panchama schools were exempted from the attendance restriction,
<i>i.e.</i>, grants were given to them, however small the attendance.
Ordinary schools had to have an attendance of ten at least to earn
grants.</p>
<p>(4) Panchama students under training as teachers get stipends at
rates nearly double of those for ordinary Hindus.</p>
<p>An interesting account of the system of education at the Olcott
Panchama Free Schools has been written by Mrs. Courtright.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e963src" href="#xd21e963" name=
"xd21e963src">32</a></p>
<p>Panchama is returned, in the Census Reports, 1891 and 1901, as a
sub-division of Balija and Banajiga.</p>
<p><b>Panch&#257;ramkatti.&mdash;</b>A sub-division of Idaiyan, which
derives its name from the neck ornament (panch&#257;ram) worn by the
women.</p>
<p><b>Pandamuttu.&mdash;</b>A sub-division of Palli. The name is made
by Winslow to mean a number of torches <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>arranged so as to
represent an elephant. The Pallis, however, explain it as referring to
the pile of pots, which reaches to the top of the marriage pandal
(pandal, booth, mutti, touching). The lowest pot is decorated with
figures of elephants and horses.</p>
<p><b>Pand&#257;ram</b>.&mdash;Pand&#257;ram is described by Mr. H. A.
Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e982src" href="#xd21e982" name=
"xd21e982src">33</a> as being &ldquo;the name rather of an occupation
than a caste, and used to denote any non-Br&#257;hmanical priest. The
Pand&#257;rams seem to receive numerous recruits from the Saivite
S&#363;dra castes, who choose to make a profession of piety, and wander
about begging. They are in reality very lax in their modes of life,
often drinking liquor and eating animal food furnished by any
respectable S&#363;dra. They often serve in Siva temples, where they
make garlands of flowers to decorate the lingam, and blow brazen
trumpets when offerings are made, or processions take place. Tirutanni
is one of the chief places, in which they congregate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Trichinopoly district, that
&ldquo;the water for the god&rsquo;s bath at Ratnagiri is brought by a
caste of non-Br&#257;hmans known as Tirumanjana Pand&#257;rams, who
fetch it every day from the Cauvery. They say that they are descended
from an &#256;ryan king, who came to the god with the hope of getting
rubies from him. The god, in the guise of a Br&#257;hman, tested his
devotion by making him fill a magic vessel with Cauvery water. The
vessel would not fill, and the &#256;ryan stranger in a fit of anger
cut off the Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s head. The dead body at once turned
into a lingam, and the &#256;ryan was ordered to carry water for the
temple till eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pand&#257;ram is used both as the name of a caste, and of a class
composed of recruits from various castes (<i>e.g.</i>, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>Vell&#257;la and Palli). The Pand&#257;ram caste
is composed of respectable people who have settled down as
land-holders, and of Sany&#257;sis and priests of certain matams
(religious institutions), and managers of richly endowed temples, such
as those at Tiruv&#257;dudurai in Tanjore and Mail&#257;m in South
Arcot. The common name for these managers is Tambir&#257;n. The caste
Pand&#257;rams are staunch Saivites and strict vegetarians. Those who
lead a celibate life wear the lingam. They are said to have been
originally S&#333;zhia Vell&#257;las, with whom intermarriage still
takes place. They are initiated into the Saivite religion by a rite
called Dh&#299;kshai, which is divided into five stages, viz., Samaya,
Nirv&#257;na, Vis&#275;sha, Kal&#257;sothanai, and Ach&#257;rya
Abhish&#275;kam. Some are temple servants, and supply flowers for the
god, while others sing d&#275;varam (hymns to the god) during the
temple service. On this account, they are known as Meik&#257;val
(body-guard of the god), and &#332;duvar (reader). The caste
Pand&#257;rams have two divisions, called Abhish&#275;ka and
D&#275;sikar, and the latter name is often taken as a title,
<i>e.g.</i>, Kandas&#257;mi D&#275;sikar. An Abhish&#275;ka
Pand&#257;ram is one who is made to pass through some ceremonies
connected with Saiva &#256;gama.</p>
<p>The mendicant Pand&#257;rams, who are recruited from various
classes, wear the lingam, and do not abstain from eating flesh. Many
villages have a Pand&#257;ram as the priest of the shrine of the
village deity, who is frequently a Palli who has become a Pand&#257;ram
by donning the lingam. The females are said to live, in some cases, by
prostitution.</p>
<p>The Ling&#257;yat Pand&#257;rams differ in many respects from the
true Ling&#257;yats. The latter respect their Jangam, and use the
sacred water, in which the feet of the Jangam are washed, for washing
their stone lingam. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"
name="pb47">47</a>]</span>To the Pand&#257;rams, and Tamil
Ling&#257;yats in general, this proceeding would amount to sacrilege of
the worst type. Canarese and Telugu Ling&#257;yats regard a Jangam as
superior to the stone lingam. In the matter of pollution ceremonies the
Tamil Ling&#257;yats are very particular, whereas the orthodox
Ling&#257;yats observe no pollution. The investiture with the lingam
does not take place so early among the Tamil as among the Canarese
Ling&#257;yats.</p>
<p>For the following note, I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao.
&ldquo;Dr. H. H. Wilson<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1006src" href=
"#xd21e1006" name="xd21e1006src">34</a> is of opinion that the word
Pand&#257;ram is &lsquo;more properly P&#257;nduranga, pale
complexioned, from their smearing themselves with ashes. It is so used
in H&#275;machandr&#257;&rsquo;s history of Mah&#257;v&#299;ra, when
speaking of the Saiva Br&#257;hmans.&rsquo; A more popular derivation
of the name is from Band&#257;ram, a public treasury. A good many
well-to-do Pand&#257;rams are managers of Siva temples in Southern
India, and accordingly have the temple treasuries under their care. It
is, however, possible that the name has been acquired by the caste by
reason of their keeping a yellow powder, called pand&#257;ram, in a
little box, and giving it in return for the alms which they
receive.</p>
<p>Opinions are divided as to whether the Pand&#257;rams are
Ling&#257;yats or not. The opinion held by F. W. Ellis, the well-known
Tamil scholar and translator of the Kural of Tiruvalluvar, is thus
summarised by Colonel Wilks.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1011src" href=
"#xd21e1011" name="xd21e1011src">35</a> &ldquo;Mr. Ellis considers the
Jangam of the upper countries, and the Pand&#257;ram of the lower, to
be of the same sect, and both deny in the most unequivocal terms the
doctrine of the metempsychosis. A manuscript in the Mackenzie
collection ascribes the origin of the Pand&#257;rams as a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>sacerdotal order of the servile caste to the
religious disputes, which terminated in the suppression of the Jain
religion in the P&#257;ndian (Madura) kingdom, and the influence which
they attained by the aid which they rendered to the Br&#257;hmans in
that controversy, but this origin seems to require confirmation. In a
large portion, perhaps in the whole of the Br&#257;hmanical temples
dedicated to Siva in the provinces of Arcot, Tanjore, Trichinopoly,
Madura and Tinnevelly, the Pand&#257;ram is the highest of the temple,
and has the entire direction of the revenues, but allows the
Br&#257;hmans to officiate in the ceremonial part according to their
own good pleasure, as a concern altogether below his note. He has
generally the reputation of an irreproachable life, and is treated by
the Br&#257;hmans of the temple with great reverence, while on his part
he looks with compassion at the absurd trifles which occupy their
attention. These facts seem to point to some former revolution, in
which a Jangam government obtained a superiority over the
Br&#257;hmanical establishments, and adopted this mode of superseding
the substantial part of their authority. It is a curious instance of
the Sooder (S&#363;dra) being the spiritual lord of the Br&#257;hman,
and is worthy of further historical investigation.&rdquo; Dr.
Wilson<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1016src" href="#xd21e1016" name=
"xd21e1016src">36</a> also thinks that the Pand&#257;rams are
Ling&#257;yats. Mr. H. A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1020src"
href="#xd21e1020" name="xd21e1020src">37</a> says that they are a class
of priests who serve the non-Br&#257;hman castes. They have returned
115 sub-divisions, of which only two are sufficiently large to require
mention, &#256;ndi of Tinnevelly and Malabar, and Lingad&#257;ri of
Chingleput and Tinnevelly. &#256;ndi is a quasi-caste of beggars
recruited from all castes, and the Lingad&#257;ri Pand&#257;rams are
the same as Jangams. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49"
name="pb49">49</a>]</span>Pand&#257;ram is, in fact, a class name
rather than the name of a caste, and it consists of priests and
beggars. Mr. C. P. Brown<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1026src" href=
"#xd21e1026" name="xd21e1026src">38</a> thinks that the Pand&#257;rams
are not Ling&#257;yats. &lsquo;The Saiva worshippers among the Tamils
are called Pand&#257;rams: these are not Vira Saivas, nor do they wear
the linga or adore Basava. I name them here chiefly because they are
often mentioned as being Vira Saivas, whereas in truth they are (like
the Smartas) Purva Saivas, and worship the image of Siva in their
houses.&rsquo; It must be remarked that Mr. Brown appears to have had a
confused idea of Pand&#257;rams. Pand&#257;rams wear the linga on their
bodies in one of the usual modes, are priests to others professing the
Ling&#257;yat religion, and are fed by them on funeral and other
ceremonial occasions. At the same time, it must be added that they
are&mdash;more especially the begging sections&mdash;very lax as
regards their food and drink. This characteristic distinguishes them
from the more orthodox Ling&#257;yats. Moreover, Ling&#257;yats remarry
their widows, whereas the Pand&#257;rams, as a caste, will not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pand&#257;rams speak Tamil. They are of two classes, the
married and celibate. The former are far more numerous than the latter,
and dress in the usual Hindu manner. They have the hind-lock of hair
known as the kudumi, put on sacred ashes, and paint the point between
the eyebrows with a sandal paste dot. The celibates wear orange-tawny
cloths, and daub sacred ashes all over their bodies. They allow the
hair of the head to become matted. They wear sandals with iron spikes,
and carry in their hands an iron tris&#363;lam (the emblem of Siva),
and a wooden baton called dand&#257;yudha (another emblem of Siva).
When they go about the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50"
name="pb50">50</a>]</span>streets, they sing popular Tamil hymns, and
beat against their begging bowl an iron chain tied by a hole to one of
its sides. Married men also beg, but only use a bell-metal gong and a
wooden mallet. Most of these help pilgrims going to the more famous
Siva temples in the Madras Presidency, <i>e.g.</i>, Tirutani, Palni,
Tiruv&#257;nn&#257;malai, or Tirupparankunram. Among both sections, the
dead are buried in the sitting posture, as among other Ling&#257;yats.
A sam&#257;dhi is erected over the spot where they are buried. This
consists of a linga and bull in miniature, which are worshipped as
often as may be found convenient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The managers of temples and mutts (religious institutions),
known as Pand&#257;ra Sannadhis, belong to the celibate class. They are
usually learned in the &#256;gamas and Pur&#257;nas. A good many of
them are Tamil scholars, and well versed in Saiva Siddh&#257;nta
philosophy. They call themselves Tambir&#257;ns&mdash;a title which is
often usurped by the uneducated beggars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Census Report, 1901, Vair&#257;vi is returned as a sub-caste
of Pand&#257;ram, and said to be found only in the Tinnevelly district,
where they are measurers of grains and p&#363;j&#257;ris in village
temples. Vair&#257;vi is further used as a name for members of the
M&#275;lakk&#257;ran caste, who officiate as servants at the temples of
the N&#257;ttuk&#333;ttai Chettis.</p>
<p>Pand&#257;ram is a title of the Panisavans and Valluvan priests of
the Paraiyans.</p>
<p>A class of people called hill Pand&#257;rams are described<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1044src" href="#xd21e1044" name=
"xd21e1044src">39</a> by the Rev. S. Mateer as &ldquo;miserable beings
without clothing, implements, or huts of any kind, living in holes,
rocks, or trees. They bring wax, ivory (tusks), and other <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>produce
to the Arayans, and get salt from them. They dig roots, snare the ibex
(wild goat, <i>Hemitragus hylocrius</i>) of the hills, and jungle
fowls, eat rats and snakes, and even crocodiles found in the pools
among the hill streams. They were perfectly naked and filthy, and very
timid. They spoke Malay&#257;lam in a curious tone, and said that
twenty-two of their party had been devoured by tigers within two
monsoons.&rdquo; Concerning these hill Pand&#257;rams, Mr. N. Subramani
Aiyar writes that they live on the banks of streams in crevices of
rocks, caves, and hollows of trees. They are known to the dwellers on
the plains as K&#257;ttumanushyar, or forest men. They clad themselves
in the bark of trees, and, in the rainy and cold seasons, protect their
bodies with plantain leaves. They speak a corrupt form of Tamil. They
fear the sight of other men, and try to avoid approaching them. A
former European magistrate of the Cardamom Hills took some of them to
his residence, but, during their three days&rsquo; stay there, they
refused to eat or talk. There is a chieftain for every four hills, but
his authority is little more than nominal. When women are married, the
earth and hills are invoked as witnesses. They have Hindu names, such
as R&#257;man, Kittan (Krishna), and Govindan.</p>
<p>In a lecture delivered some years ago at Trivandrum, Mr. O. H.
Bensley described the hill Pand&#257;rams as being &ldquo;skilful in
catching fish, their mode of cooking which is to place the fish on
roots on a rock, and cover them with fire. They keep dogs, and, by
their aid, replenish their larder with rats, mungooses, iguanas
(lizard, <i>Varanus</i>), and other delicacies. I was told that the
authority recognised by these people is the head Arayan, to whom they
give a yearly offering of jungle produce, receiving in exchange the
scanty clothing required by them. We had an opportunity of examining
their stock-in-trade, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52"
name="pb52">52</a>]</span>which consisted of a bill-hook similar to
those used by other hillmen, a few earthen cooking-pots, and a good
stock of white flour, which was, they said, obtained from the bark of a
tree, the name of which sounded like &#257;hlum. They were all small in
stature, with the exception of one young woman, and, both in appearance
and intelligence, compared favourably with the Ur&#257;lis.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Pand&#257;riyar.&mdash;</b>Pand&#257;riyar or Pand&#257;rattar,
denoting custodians of the treasury, has been returned as a title of
Nattam&#257;n, Malaim&#257;n, and Sudarm&#257;n.</p>
<p><b>P&#257;ndava-kulam.&mdash;</b>A title, indicative &ldquo;of the
caste of the P&#257;ndava kings,&rdquo; assumed by J&#257;tapus and
Konda Doras, who worship the P&#257;ndavas. The P&#257;ndava kings were
the heroes of the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, who fought a great battle with
the Kauravas, and are said to have belonged to the lunar race of
Kshatriyas. The P&#257;ndavas had a single wife named Draupadi, whom
the Pallis or Vanniyans worship, and celebrate annually in her honour a
fire-walking festival. The Pallis claim to belong to the fire race of
Kshatriyas, and style themselves Agnikula Kshatriyas, or Vannikula
Kshatriyas.</p>
<p><b>Pandi</b> (pig).&mdash;Recorded as an exogamous sept of Asili,
B&#333;ya, and Gamalla. Pandipattu (pig catchers) and Pandikottu (pig
killers) occur as exogamous septs of Odd&#275;.</p>
<p><b>Pandito.&mdash;</b>Pandit or Pundit (pandita, a learned man) has
been defined<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1076src" href="#xd21e1076"
name="xd21e1076src">40</a> as &ldquo;properly a man learned in Sanskrit
lore. The Pundit of the Supreme Court was a Hindu law-officer, whose
duty it was to advise the English Judges when needful on questions of
Hindu law. The office became extinct on the constitution of the High
Court (in 1862). In the Mahratta and Telugu <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>countries, the word Pandit is usually pronounced
Pant (in English colloquial Punt).&rdquo; In the countries noted, Pant
occurs widely as a title of Br&#257;hmans, who are also referred to as
Pantulu v&#257;ru. The titles Sanskrit Pundit, Telugu Pundit, etc., are
still officially recognised at several colleges in the Madras
Presidency. Pandit sometimes occurs as an honorific prefix,
<i>e.g.</i>, Pandit S. M. Natesa Sastri, and Panditan is a name given
to Tamil barbers (Ambattan). In some parts of the Tamil country,
Panditar is used as a name for M&#257;dhva Br&#257;hmans, because, it
is said, many of them were formerly engaged as pandits at the Law
Courts.</p>
<p>Pandito is further the name of &ldquo;an Oriya caste of astrologers
and physicians. They wear the sacred thread, and accept drinking water
only from Br&#257;hmans and Gaudos. Infant marriage is practiced, and
widow marriage is prohibited.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1086src" href="#xd21e1086" name="xd21e1086src">41</a> I am
informed that these Panditos engage Br&#257;hmans for their
ceremonials, do not drink liquor, and eat fish and mutton, but not
fowls or beef. The females wear glass bangles. They are known by the
name of Khodik&#257;ro, from khodi, a kind of stone, with which they
write figures on the floor, when making astrological calculations. The
stone is said to be something like soapstone.</p>
<p>Pandita occurs as an exogamous sept of St&#257;nikas.</p>
<p><b>P&#257;ndya.&mdash;</b>The territorial name P&#257;ndya,
P&#257;ndiya, P&#257;ndiyan, or P&#257;ndi has been returned, at recent
times of census, as a sub-division of various Tamil classes,
<i>e.g.</i>, Ambattan, Kamm&#257;lan, &#332;cchan, Pallan, Vann&#257;n,
and Vell&#257;la. P&#257;ndiya is further a title of some
Sh&#257;n&#257;ns. In Travancore, P&#257;ndi has been returned by some
Izhavans. The variant P&#257;ndiangal occurs as an exogamous sept of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>the Tamil Vallambans, and P&#257;ndu as a Tamil
synonym for K&#257;pu or Reddi.</p>
<p><b>Panikkar.&mdash;</b>Panikkar, meaning teacher or worker, has been
recorded, in the Malay&#257;lam country, as a title of barbers,
Kamm&#257;lan, M&#257;r&#257;n, N&#257;yar, P&#257;n&#257;n, and
Paraiyan. In former times, the name was applied, in Malabar, to
fencing-masters, as the following quotations show :&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">1518. &ldquo;And there are very skilful men who teach
this art (fencing), and they are called
Panicars.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Barbosa.</i></p>
<p>1553. &ldquo;And when the Naire comes to the age of 7 years, he is
obliged to go to the fencing-school, the master of which (whom they
call Panical) they regard as a father, on account of the instruction he
gives them.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Barros.</i></p>
<p>1583. &ldquo;The maisters which teach them be graduates in the
weapons which they teach, and they be called in their language
Panycaes.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Castaneda.</i></p>
</div>
<p>A class of people called Panikkan are settled in the Madura and
Tinnevelly districts. Some of them are barbers to Sh&#257;n&#257;ns.
Others have taken to weaving as a profession, and will not intermarry
with those who are employed as barbers. &ldquo;The Panikkans
are,&rdquo; Mr. Francis writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1122src"
href="#xd21e1122" name="xd21e1122src">42</a> &ldquo;weavers,
agriculturists, and traders. They employ Br&#257;hmans as priests, but
these are apparently not received on terms of equality by other
Br&#257;hmans. The Panikkans now frequently call themselves Illam
Vell&#257;las, and change their title in deeds and official papers from
Panikkan to Pillai. They are also taking to wearing the sacred thread
and giving up eating meat. The caste is divided into three vagais or
endogamous classes, namely, Mit&#257;l, Pattanam, and Malay&#257;lam,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>each of these again has five partly exogamous
septs or illams (families), namely, M&#363;ttillam, T&#333;ranattillam,
Pallikkillam, Manjan&#257;ttillam, and S&#333;liya-illam. It is stated
that the Mit&#257;l and Pattanam sections will eat together though they
do not intermarry, but that the Malay&#257;lam section can neither dine
with nor marry into the other two. They are reported to have an
elaborate system of caste government, under which eleven villages form
a gadistalam (or stage), and send representatives to its council to
settle caste matters; and eleven gadistalams form a n&#257;du (or
country), and send representatives to a chief council, which decides
questions which are beyond the competence of the gadistalams.&rdquo;
The occurrence of Malay&#257;m as the name of a sub-division, and of
the Malay&#257;lam word illam as that of the exogamous septs, would
seem to indicate that the Panikkans are immigrants from the westward
into the Tamil country.</p>
<p><b>Panimagan</b> (work children).&mdash;A name for Mukkuvans who are
employed as barbers for members of their caste.</p>
<p><b>Panisavan.&mdash;</b>Panisavan is defined in the Salem Manual as
&ldquo;a corruption of paniseygiravan (panisaivon), literally meaning
one who works (or does service), and is the caste name of the class,
whose business it is to carry news of death to the relations of the
deceased, and to blow the th&#257;rai or long trumpet.&rdquo; According
to Mr. H. A. Stuart,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1135src" href=
"#xd21e1135" name="xd21e1135src">43</a> Panisavan appears to answer
among the Tamilians to the D&#257;saris or T&#257;das of the Telugus.
It is a mendicant caste, worshipping Siva. Unlike the T&#257;das,
however, they often employ themselves in cultivation, and are, on the
whole, a more temperate and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>respectable class. Their priests are
Br&#257;hmans, and they eat flesh, and drink alcoholic liquor very
freely. The dead are generally burned.</p>
<p>There are two classes of Panisavans, of which one works for the
right-hand section, and the other for the left. This division is purely
professional, and there is apparently no bar to intermarriage between
the two classes. The insignia of a Panisavan are the conch-shell
(<i>Turbinella rapa</i>) and th&#257;rai, which he supports from the
ground by means of a bamboo pole while he blows it. At marriage
processions, it is his duty to go in front, sounding the th&#257;rai
from time to time. On such occasions, and at festivals of the village
goddesses, the th&#257;rai is decorated with a string bearing a number
of small triangular pieces of cloth, and tufts of yak&rsquo;s hair. The
cloth should be white for the right-hand section, and of five different
colours for the left. At the present day, the Panisavan is more in
request for funerals than for weddings. In the city of Madras, all the
materials necessary for the bier are sold by Panisavans, who also keep
palanquins for the conveyance of the corpse in stock, which are let out
on hire. At funerals, the Panisavan has to follow the corpse, blowing
his conch-shell. The th&#257;rai is only used if the deceased was an
important personage. When the son goes round the corpse with a pot of
water, the Panisavan accompanies him, and blows the conch. On the last
day of the death ceremonies (karm&#257;ndhiram), the Panisavan should
be present, and blow his conch, especially when the t&#257;li (marriage
badge) is removed from a widow&rsquo;s neck. In some places, the
Panisavan conveys the news of death, while in others this duty is
carried out by a barber. In the Chingleput and North Arcot districts,
the Panisavans constitute a separate <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>caste, and have no
connection with the N&#333;kkans, who are beggars attached to the Palli
or Vanniyan caste. In South Arcot and Tanjore, on the other hand, the
name N&#333;kkan is used to signify the caste, which performs the
duties of the Panisavan, for which it seems to be a synonym. The
Panisavans of the Tinnevelly district have nothing in common with those
of the northern districts, <i>e.g.</i>, Chingleput and North Arcot,
whose duty it is to attend to the funeral ceremonies of the
non-Br&#257;hman castes. The main occupations of the Tinnevelly
Panisavans are playing in temples on the n&#257;gasaram (reed
instrument), and teaching D&#275;va-d&#257;sis dancing. Another
occupation, which is peculiar to the Tinnevelly Panisavans, is achu
v&#275;lai, <i>i.e.</i>, the preparation of the comb to which the warp
threads of a weaving loom are tied. Socially the Panisavans occupy a
lowly position, but they use the title Pulavar. Their other titles are
Pand&#257;ram, Pillai, and Mudali.</p>
<p><b>Paniyan.&mdash;</b>The Paniyans are a dark-skinned tribe, short
in stature, with broad noses, and curly or wavy hair, inhabiting the
Wyn&#257;d, and those portions of the Ern&#257;d, Calicut,
Kurumbran&#257;d and Kottayam t&#257;luks of Malabar, which skirt the
base of the gh&#257;ts, and the Mudan&#257;d, Cherang&#333;d, and
Namblak&#333;d amshams of the N&#299;lgiri district.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e1159width" id="pl6-057"><img src=
"images/pl6-057.jpg" alt="Paniyan." width="498" height="681">
<p class="figureHead">Paniyan.</p>
</div>
<p>A common belief, based on their general appearance, prevails among
the European planting community that the Paniyans are of African
origin, and descended from ancestors who were wrecked on the Malabar
coast. This theory, however, breaks down on investigation. Of their
origin nothing definite is known. The N&#257;yar Janmis (landlords) say
that, when surprised in the act of some mischief or alarmed, the
Paniyan calls out &lsquo;Ippi&rsquo;! &lsquo;Ippi&rsquo;! as he runs
away, and they believe this to have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58"
href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>been the name of the country
whence they came originally; but they are ignorant as to where
Ippimala, as they call it, is situated. Kapiri (Africa or the Cape?) is
also sometimes suggested as their original habitat, but only by those
who have had the remarks of Europeans communicated to them. The Paniyan
himself, though he occasionally puts forward one or other of the above
places as the home of his forefathers, has no fixed tradition bearing
on their arrival in Malabar, beyond one to the effect that they were
brought from a far country, where they were found living by a
R&#257;ja, who captured them, and carried them off in such a miserable
condition that a man and his wife only possessed one cloth between
them, and were so timid that it was only by means of hunting nets that
they were captured.</p>
<p>The number of Paniyans, returned at the census, 1891, was 33,282,
and nine sub-divisions were registered; but, as Mr. H. A. Stuart, the
Census Commissioner, observes:&mdash;&ldquo;Most of these are not real,
and none has been returned by any considerable number of
persons.&rdquo; Their position is said to be very little removed from
that of a slave, for every Paniyan is some landlord&rsquo;s
&lsquo;man&rsquo;; and, though he is, of course, free to leave his
master, he is at once traced, and good care is taken that he does not
get employment elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the fifties of the last century, when planters first began to
settle in the Wyn&#257;d, they purchased the land with the Paniyans
living on it, who were practically slaves of the land-owners. The
Paniyans used formerly to be employed by rich receivers as professional
coffee thieves, going out by night to strip the bushes of their
berries, which were delivered to the receiver before morning. Unlike
the Badagas of the N&#299;lgiris, who are also coffee thieves, and are
afraid to be out after dark, the Paniyans <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>are not afraid of bogies
by night, and would not hesitate to commit nocturnal depredations. My
friend, Mr. G. Romilly, on whose estate my investigation of the
Paniyans was mainly carried out, assures me that, according to his
experience, the domesticated Paniyan, if well paid, is honest, and fit
to be entrusted with the responsible duties of night watchman.</p>
<p>In some localities, where the Janmis have sold the bulk of their
land, and have consequently ceased to find regular employment for them,
the Paniyans have taken kindly to working on coffee estates, but
comparatively few are thus employed. The word Paniyan means labourer,
and they believe that their original occupation was agriculture as it
is, for the most part, at the present day. Those, however, who earn
their livelihood on estates, only cultivate rice and r&#257;gi
(<i>Eleusine coracana</i>) for their own cultivation; and women and
children may be seen digging up jungle roots, or gathering pot-herbs
for food. They will not eat the flesh of jackals, snakes, vultures,
lizards, rats, or other vermin. But I am told that they eat land-crabs,
in lieu of expensive lotions, to prevent baldness and grey hairs. They
have a distinct partiality for alcohol, and those who came to be
measured by me were made more than happy by a present of a two-anna
piece, a cheroot, and a liberal allowance of undiluted fiery brandy
from the Mepp&#257;di baz&#257;r. The women are naturally of a shy
disposition, and used formerly to run away and hide at the sight of a
European. They were at first afraid to come and see me, but confidence
was subsequently established, and all the women came to visit me, some
to go through the ordeal of measurement, others to laugh at and make
derisive comments on those who were undergoing the operation.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>Practically the whole of the rice cultivation in the Wyn&#257;d is
carried out by the Paniyans attached to edoms (houses or places) or
d&#275;vasoms (temple property) of the great N&#257;yar landlords; and
Chettis and M&#257;ppillas also frequently have a few Paniyans, whom
they have bought or hired by the year at from four to eight rupees per
family from a Janmi. When planting paddy or herding cattle, the Paniyan
is seldom seen without the kontai or basket-work protection from the
rain. This curious, but most effective substitute for the umbrella-hat
of the Malabar coast, is made of split reeds interwoven with
&lsquo;arrow-root&rsquo; leaves, and shaped something like a huge
inverted coal-scoop turned on end, and gives to the individual wearing
it the appearance of a gigantic mushroom. From the nature of his daily
occupation the Paniyan is often brought in contact with wild animals,
and is generally a bold, and, if excited, as he usually is on an
occasion such as the netting of a tiger, a reckless fellow. The young
men of the villages vie with each other in the zeal which they display
in carrying out the really dangerous work of cutting back the jungle to
within a couple of spear-lengths of the place where the quarry lies
hidden, and often make a show of their indifference by turning and
conversing with their friends outside the net.</p>
<p>Years ago it was not unusual for people to come long distance for
the purpose of engaging Wyn&#257;d Paniyans to help them in carrying
out some more than usually desperate robbery or murder. Their mode of
procedure, when engaged in an enterprise of this sort, is evidenced by
two cases, which had in them a strong element of savagery. On both
these occasions the thatched homesteads were surrounded at dead of
night by gangs of Paniyans carrying large bundles of rice straw. After
carefully piling up the straw on all sides of the building <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>marked
for destruction, torches were, at a given signal, applied, and those of
the wretched inmates who attempted to escape were knocked on the head
with clubs, and thrust into the fiery furnace.</p>
<p>The Paniyans settle down happily on estates, living in a settlement
consisting of rows of huts and detached huts, single or double storied,
built of bamboo and thatched. During the hot weather, in the unhealthy
months which precede the advent of the south-west monsoon, they shift
their quarters to live near streams, or in other cool, shady spots,
returning to their head quarters when the rains set in.</p>
<p>They catch fish either by means of big flat bamboo mats, or, in a
less orthodox manner, by damming a stream and poisoning the water with
herbs, bark, and fruit, which are beaten to a pulp and thrown into the
water. The fish, becoming stupified, float on the surface, and fall an
easy and unfairly earned prey.</p>
<p>It is recorded by Mr. H. C. Wilson<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1191src" href="#xd21e1191" name="xd21e1191src">44</a> that the
section of the Moyar river &ldquo;stretching from the bottom of the
Pykara falls down to the sheer drop into the Mysore ditch below
Teppakadu is occupied principally by Carnatic carp. In the upper
reaches I found traces of small traps placed across side runners or
ditches, which were then dry. They had evidently been in use during the
last floods, and allowed to remain. Constructed of wood in the shape of
a large rake head with long teeth close together, they are fastened
securely across the ditch or runner at a slight angle with teeth in the
gravel. The object is to catch the small fry which frequent these side
places for protection during flood times. Judging by their primitive
nature and poor construction, they are <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>not effective, but will
do a certain amount of damage. The nearest hamlet to this place is
called Torappalli, occupied by a few fisher people called Paniyans.
These are no doubt the makers of the traps, and, from information I
received, they are said to possess better fry and other traps. They are
also accredited with having fine-mesh nets, which they use when the
waters are low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1907, rules were issued, under the Indian Fisheries Act, IV of
1897, for the protection of fish in the Bhav&#257;ni and Moyar rivers.
These rules referred to the erection and use of fixed engines, the
construction of weirs, and the use of nets, the meshes of which are
less than one and a half inches square for the capture or destruction
of fish, and the prohibition of fishing between the 15th March and 15th
September annually. Notice of the rules was given by beat of tom-tom
(drum) in the villages lying on the banks of the rivers, to which the
rules applied.</p>
<p>The Paniyan language is a debased Malay&#257;lam patois spoken in a
curious nasal sing-song, difficult to imitate; but most of the Paniyans
employed on estates can also converse in Kanarese.</p>
<p>Wholly uneducated and associating with no other tribes, the Paniyans
have only very crude ideas of religion. Believing in devils of all
sorts and sizes, and professing to worship the Hindu divinities, they
reverence especially the god of the jungles, K&#257;d Bhagavadi, or,
according to another version, a deity called K&#363;li, a malignant and
terrible being of neither sex, whose shrines take the form of a stone
placed under a tree, or sometimes a cairn of stones. At their rude
shrines they contribute as offerings to the sw&#257;mi (god) rice
boiled in the husk, roasted and pounded, half-a-cocoanut, and small
coins. The banyan and a lofty tree, apparently of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>the fig
tribe, are reverenced by them, inasmuch as evil spirits are reputed to
haunt them at times. Trees so haunted must not be touched, and, if the
Paniyans attempt to cut them, they fall sick.</p>
<p>Some Paniyans are believed to be gifted with the power of changing
themselves into animals; and there is a belief among the Paniyan
dwellers in the plains that, if they wish to secure a woman whom they
lust after, one of the men gifted with this special power goes to her
house at night with a hollow bamboo, and encircles the house three
times. The woman then comes out, and the man, changing himself into a
bull or dog, works his wicked will. The woman, it is believed, dies in
the course of two or three days.</p>
<p>In 1904 some Paniyans were employed by a M&#257;ppilla (Muhammadan)
to murder his mistress, who was pregnant, and threatened that she would
noise abroad his responsibility for her condition. He brooded over the
matter, and one day, meeting a Paniyan, promised him ten rupees if he
would kill the woman. The Paniyan agreed to commit the crime, and went
with his brothers to a place on a hill, where the M&#257;ppilla and the
woman were in the habit of gratifying their passions. Thither the man
and woman followed the Paniyans, of whom one ran out, and struck his
victim on the head with a chopper. She was then gagged with a cloth,
carried some distance, and killed. The two Paniyans and the
M&#257;ppilla were sentenced to be hanged.</p>
<p>Monogamy appears to be the general rule among the Paniyans, but
there is no obstacle to a man taking unto himself as many wives as he
can afford to support.</p>
<p>Apparently the bride is selected for a young man by his parents,
and, in the same way that a wealthy European sometimes sends his
betrothed a daily present <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href=
"#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>of a bouquet, the more humble Paniyan
bridegroom-elect has to take a bundle of firewood to the house of the
fianc&eacute;e every day for six months. The marriage ceremony (and the
marriage knot does not appear to be very binding) is of a very simple
nature. The ceremony is conducted by a Paniyan Chemmi (a corruption of
Janmi). A present of sixteen fanams (coins) and some new cloths is
given by the bridegroom to the Chemmi, who hands them over to the
parents of the bride. A feast is prepared, at which the Paniyan women
(Panichis) dance to the music of drum and pipe. The t&#257;li (or
marriage badge) is tied round the neck of the bride by the female
relations of the bridegroom, who also invest the bride with such crude
jewelry as they may be able to afford. The Chemmi seals the contract by
pouring water over the head and feet of the young couple. It is
said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1215src" href="#xd21e1215" name=
"xd21e1215src">45</a> that a husband has to make an annual present to
his wife&rsquo;s parents; and failure to do so entitles them to demand
their daughter back. A man may, I was told, not have two sisters as
wives; nor may he marry his deceased wife&rsquo;s sister. Remarriage of
widows is permitted. Adultery and other forms of vice are adjudicated
on by a panch&#257;yat (or council) of headmen, who settle disputes and
decide on the fine or punishment to be inflicted on the guilty. At
nearly every considerable Paniyan village there is a headman called
K&#363;ttan, who has been appointed by N&#257;yar Janmi to look after
his interests, and be responsible to him for the other inhabitants of
the village. The investiture of the K&#363;ttan with the powers of
office is celebrated with a feast and dance, at which a bangle is
presented to the K&#363;ttan as a badge of authority. Next in rank to
the K&#363;ttan is the Mudali <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>or head of the family, and they
usually constitute the panch&#257;yat. Both K&#363;ttan and Mudali are
called M&#363;ppanmar or elders. The whole caste is sometimes loosely
spoken of as M&#363;ppan. In a case of proved adultery, a fine of
sixteen fanams (the amount of the marriage fee), and a sum equal to the
expenses of the wedding, including the present to the parents of the
bride, is the usual form of punishment.</p>
<p>The Chemmi or Shemmi is, I am informed, a sort of priest or
minister. He was appointed, in olden days, by the chieftains under whom
the Paniyans worked, and each Chemmi held authority over a group of
villages. The office is hereditary, but, should a Chemmi family fail,
it can be filled up by election.</p>
<p>No ceremony takes place in celebration of the birth of children. One
of the old women of the village acts as midwife, and receives a small
present in return for her services. As soon as a child is old enough to
be of use, it accompanies its parents to their work, or on their
fishing and hunting expeditions, and is initiated into the various ways
of adding to the stock of provisions for the household.</p>
<p>The dead are buried in the following manner. A trench, four or five
feet deep, and large enough to receive the body to be interred, is dug,
due north and south, on a hill near the village. At the bottom of this
excavation the earth is scooped out from the western side on a level
with the floor throughout the length of the grave, so as to form a
receptacle for the corpse, which, placed on a mat, is laid therein upon
its left side with the head pointing to the south and the feet to the
north. After a little cooked rice has been put into the grave for the
use of the departed spirit, the mat, which has been made broad enough
for the purpose, is folded up and tucked in under <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>the roof
of the cavity, and the trench filled up. It has probably been found by
experience that the corpse, when thus protected, is safe from the
ravages of scavenger jackals and pariah dogs. For seven days after
death, a little rice gruel is placed at distance of from fifty to a
hundred yards from the grave by the Chemmi, who claps his hands as a
signal to the evil spirits in the vicinity, who, in the shape of a pair
of crows, are supposed to partake of the food, which is hence called
k&#257;ka conji or crow&rsquo;s rice.</p>
<p>The noombu or mourning ceremonies are the t&#299; polay, seven days
after death; the k&#257;ka polay or karuvelli held for three years in
succession in the month of Magaram (January-February); and the matham
polay held once in every three or four years, when possible, as a
memorial service in honour of those who are specially respected. On all
these occasions the Chemmi presides, and acts as a sort of master of
the ceremonies. As the ceremonial carried out differs only in degree,
an account of the k&#257;ka polay will do for all.</p>
<p>In the month of Magaram, the noombukarrans or mourners (who have
lost relatives) begin to cook and eat in a pandal or shed set apart
from the rest of the village, but otherwise go about their business as
usual. They wash and eat twice a day, but abstain from eating meat or
fish. On the last day of the month, arrangements are made, under the
supervision of the Chemmi, for the ceremony which brings the period of
mourning to a close. The mourners, who have fasted since daybreak, take
up their position in the pandal, and the Chemmi, holding on his crossed
arms two winnowing sieves, each containing a seer or two of rice, walks
round three times, and finally deposits the sieves in the centre of the
pandal. If, among the male relatives of the deceased, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>one is
to be found sufficiently hysterical, or actor enough, to simulate
possession and perform the functions of an oracle, well and good; but,
should they all be of a stolid temperament, there is always at hand a
professional corresponding to the Kom&#257;ran or Vellichip&#257;d of
other Hindus. This individual is called the Patalyk&#257;ran. With a
new cloth (mundu) on his head, and smeared on the body and arms with a
paste made of rice flour and gh&#299; (clarified butter), he enters on
the scene with his legs girt with bells, the music of which is supposed
to drive away the attendant evil spirits (payanmar). Advancing with
short steps and rolling his eyes, he staggers to and fro, sawing the
air with two small sticks which he holds in either hand, and works
himself up into a frenzied state of inspiration, while the mourners cry
out and ask why the dead have been taken away from them. Presently a
convulsive shiver attacks the performer, who staggers more violently
and falls prostrate on the ground, or seeks the support of one of the
posts of the pandal, while he gasps out disjointed sentences, which are
taken to be the words of the god. The mourners now make obeisance, and
are marked on the forehead with the paste of rice flour and gh&#299;.
This done, a mat is spread for the accommodation of the headmen and
Chemmi; and the Patalyk&#257;ran, from whose legs the bells have been
removed and put with the rice in the sieves, takes these in his hands,
and, shaking them as he speaks, commences a funeral chant, which lasts
till dawn. Meanwhile food has been prepared for all present except the
mourners, and when this has been partaken of, dancing is kept up round
the central group till daybreak, when the pandal is pulled down and the
k&#257;ka polay is over. Those who have been precluded from eating make
up for lost time, and relatives, who have <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>allowed their hair to
grow long, shave. The ordinary Paniyan does not profess to know the
meaning of the funeral orations, but contents himself with a belief
that it is known to those who are initiated. The women attend the
ceremony, but do not take part in the dance. In fact, the nearest
approach to a dance that they ever attempt (and this only on festive
occasions) resembles the ordinary occupation of planting rice, carried
out in dumb show to the music of a drum. The bodies of the performers
stoop and move in time with the music, and the arms are swung from side
to side as in the act of placing the rice seedlings in their rows. To
see a long line of Paniyan women, up to their knees in the mud of a
rice field, bobbing up and down and putting on the pace as the music
grows quicker and quicker, and to hear the wild yells of Hou! Hou! like
a chorus of hungry dogs, which form the vocal accompaniment as they dab
the green bunches in from side to side, is highly amusing.</p>
<p>The foregoing account of the Paniyan death ceremonies was supplied
by Mr. Colin Mackenzie, to whom, as also to Mr. F. Fawcett, Mr. G.
Romilly, and Martelli, I am indebted for many of the facts recorded in
the present note. From Mr. Fawcett the following account of a further
ceremony was obtained:&mdash;</p>
<p>At a Paniyan village, on a coffee estate where the annual ceremony
was being celebrated, men and boys were dancing round a wooden upright
to the music of a small drum hanging at the left hip. Some of the
dancers had bells round the leg below the knee. Close to the upright a
man was seated, playing a pipe, which emitted sounds like those of a
bagpipe. In dancing, the dancers went round against the sun. At some
little distance a crowd of females indulged in a dance by themselves. A
characteristic of the dance, specially noticeable among <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>the
women, was stooping and waving of the arms in front. The dancers
perspired freely, and kept up the dance for many hours to rhythmic
music, the tune of which changed from time to time. There were three
chief dancers, of whom one represented the goddess, the others her
ministers. They were smeared with streaks on the chest, abdomen, arms
and legs, had bells on the legs, and carried a short stick about two
feet in length in each hand. The sticks were held over the head, while
the performers quivered as if in a religious frenzy. Now and again, the
sticks were waved or beaten together. The Paniyans believe that, when
the goddess first appeared to them, she carried two sticks in her
hands. The mock goddess and her attendants, holding the sticks above
the head and shivering, went to each male elder, and apparently
received his blessing, the elder placing his hand on their faces as a
form of salutation, and then applying his hand to his own face. The
villagers partook of a light meal in the early morning, and would not
eat again until the end of the ceremony, which concluded by the
man-goddess seating himself on the upright, and addressing the crowd on
behalf of the goddess concerning their conduct and morality.</p>
<p>The Paniyans &ldquo;worship animistic deities, of which the chief is
K&#363;li, whom they worship on a raised platform called Kulitara,
offering cocoanuts, but no blood.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1245src" href="#xd21e1245" name="xd21e1245src">46</a> They
further worship K&#257;ttu Bhagavati, or Bhagavati of the woods.
&ldquo;Shrines in her honour are to be found at most centres of the
caste, and contain no image, but a box in which are kept the clothing
and jewels presented to her by the devout. An annual ceremony lasting a
week is held in her honour, at which the Kom&#257;ran and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>a kind
of priest, called Nolambuk&#257;ran, take the chief parts. The former
dresses in the goddess&rsquo; clothing, and the divine afflatus
descends upon him, and he prophesies both good and evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Games.</i>&mdash;A long strip of cane is suspended from the
branch of a tree, and a cross-bar fixed to its lower end. On the bar a
boy sits, and swings himself in all directions. In another game a bar,
twelve to fourteen feet in length, is balanced by means of a point in a
socket on an upright reaching about four feet and-a-half above the
ground. Over the end of the horizontal bar a boy hangs, and, touching
the ground with the feet, spins himself round.</p>
<p>Some Paniyans have a thread tied round the wrist, ankle, or neck, as
a charm to ward off fever and other diseases. Some of the men have the
hair of the head hanging down in matted tails in performance of a vow.
The men wear brass, steel, and copper rings on their fingers and brass
rings in the ears.</p>
<p>The women, in like manner, wear finger rings, and, in addition,
bangles on the wrist, and have the lobes of the ears widely dilated,
and plugged with cadjan (palm leaf) rolls. In some the nostril is
pierced, and plugged with wood.</p>
<p>The Paniyans, who dwell in settlements at the base of the
gh&#257;ts, make fire by what is known as the Malay or sawing
method<span class="corr" id="xd21e1260" title="Not in source">.</span>
A piece of bamboo, about a foot in length, in which two nodes are
included, is split longitudinally into two equal parts. On one half a
sharp edge is cut with a knife. In the other a longitudinal slit is
made through about two-thirds of its length, which is stuffed with a
piece of cotton cloth. It is then held firmly on the ground with its
convex surface upwards, and the cutting edge drawn, with a gradually
quickening <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>sawing motion, rapidly to and fro across it by two
men, until the cloth is ignited by the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1265" title="Source: incandesent">incandescent</span> particles
of wood in the groove cut by the sharp edge. The cloth is then blown
with the lips into a blaze, and the tobacco or cooking fire can be
lighted.</p>

<p>At Pudup&#257;di an elephant mahout was jealously guarding a bit of

<p>Average height 157.4 cm. Nasal index 95 (max. 108.6). The average
distance from the tip of the middle finger to the top of the patella
was 4.6 cm. relative to stature = 100, which approximates very closely
to the recorded results of measurement of long-limbed African
negroes.</p>
<p><b>Panjai.&mdash;</b>Recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as
a sub-division of P&#257;ndya Vell&#257;la. The name Panjai, indicating
a poverty-stricken individual, is usually applied to mendicant
Pand&#257;rams.</p>
<p><b>Panj&#257;ram.&mdash;</b>Panj&#257;ram or Panch&#257;ramkatti is
the name of a sub-division of the Idaiyans, derived from the peculiar
gold ornament, which the women wear. It is said that, in this division,
widow marriage is commonly practiced, because Krishna used to place a
similar ornament round the necks of Idaiyan widows of whom he became
enamoured, and that this sub-division was the result of his amours with
them.</p>
<p><b>Panjukk&#257;ra</b> (cotton-man).&mdash;An occupational name of a
sub-division of Vell&#257;las, who are not at the present day connected
with the cotton trade. They call themselves Panjukk&#257;ra Chettis.
The equivalent panj&#257;ri (pinj&#257;ri) or Panjukotti occurs as a
Tamil synonym for D&#363;d&#275;kula (Muhammadan cotton-cleaners).

<p><b>P&#257;no.&mdash;</b>In the Madras Census Report, 1891, the
P&#257;nos are described as &ldquo;a caste of weavers found in the
Ganjam district. This caste is no doubt identical with the P&#257;ns, a
weaving, basket-making, and servile caste of Orissa and Chota Nagpore.
The P&#257;nos occupy the same position among the Khonds of Ganjam as
the Dombs hold among the inhabitants of the Vizagapatam hills, and the
words P&#257;no and Dombo are generally regarded as synonyms
[<i>See</i> D&#333;mb]. The members of the Sitra sub-division are
workers in metal.&rdquo; It is further noted, in the Census Report,
1901, that the P&#257;nos are &ldquo;an extensive caste of hill weavers
found chiefly in the Ganjam Agency. The Khond synonym for this word is
Domboloko, which helps to confirm the connection between this caste and
the Dombas of Vizagapatam. They speak Khond and Oriya.&rdquo; In a note
on the P&#257;nos, I read that &ldquo;their occupations are trading,
weaving, and theft. They live on the ignorance and superstition of the
Khonds as brokers, pedlars, sycophants, and cheats. In those parts
where there are no Oriyas, they possess much influence, and are always
consulted by the Khonds in questions of boundary disputes.&rdquo; In a
brief account of the P&#257;nos, Mr. C. F. MacCartie writes<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1318src" href="#xd21e1318" name=
"xd21e1318src">47</a> that &ldquo;the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>P&#257;nos, also known by
the title of Dombo or Sitra in some parts, are supposed to be Paraiya
[Telugu Mala] emigrants from the low country. Their profession is
weaving or brass work, the monotony of which they vary by petty trading
in horns, skins and live cattle, and occasionally enliven by
house-breaking and theft at the expense of the Khonds, who have an
incautious trick of leaving their habitations utterly unguarded when
they go off to the hills to cultivate. [In the Madras Census Report,
1901, the Sitras are said to be supposed to be the progeny of a Khond
man and a Haddi woman, who manufacture the brass rings and bangles worn
by the Khonds.] The P&#257;nos are drunken, immoral, and dirty in their
habits. The Khonds refuse to eat with them, but I do not find that this
objection extends to drinking, at which both Khond and P&#257;no
display surprising capabilities. P&#257;nos are also the professional
musicians of the country, and attend weddings, deaths and sacrifices in
this character, for which they are recompensed with food, liquor, and
cloths. The generality of Khond and P&#257;no houses are constructed of
broad s&acirc;l (<i>Shorea robusta</i>) logs, hewn out with the axe and
thatched with jungle grass, which is impervious to white-ants. In
bamboo jungles, of course, bamboo is substituted for s&acirc;l. The
P&#257;nos generally affect a detached quarter, known as Dombo sai.
Intermarriage between Khonds, P&#257;nos, and Uriyas is not recognised,
but cases do occur when a P&#257;no induces a Khond woman to go off
with him. She may live with him as his wife, but no ceremony takes
place. [A few years ago, a young Khond was betrothed to the daughter of
another Khond, and, after a few years, managed to pay up the necessary
number of gifts. He then applied to the girl&rsquo;s father to name the
day for the marriage. Before the wedding took place however, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>P&#257;no went to the girl&rsquo;s father, and
said that she was his daughter (she had been born before her parents
were married), and that he was the man to whom the gifts should have
been paid. The case was referred to a council, which decided in favour
of the P&#257;no.] If a P&#257;no commits adultery with a Khond married
woman, he has to pay a paronjo, or a fine of a buffalo to the husband
(who retains his wife), and in addition a goat, a pig, a basket of
paddy (rice), a rupee, and a load of pots. There is close communication
between the P&#257;nos and the Khonds, as the former act as the
advisers of the latter in all cases of doubt or difficulty. The Uriyas
live apart from both, and mix but little with either, except on the
occasion of sacrifices or other solemn assemblages, when buffaloes are
slaughtered for P&#257;nos and Khonds, and goats or sheep for Uriya
visitors. [It is noted, in the Ganjam Manual, in connection with Khond
death ceremonies, that &ldquo;if a man has been killed by a tiger,
purification is made by the sacrifice of a pig, the head of which is
cut off with a tangi (axe) by a P&#257;no, and passed between the legs
of the men in the village, who stand in a line astraddle. It is a bad
omen to him, if the head touches any man&rsquo;s legs.] Among the
products of the jungles may be included myrabolams (<i>Terminalia</i>
fruits), tasar silk cocoons, and dammer, all of which are bartered by
the finders to trading P&#257;nos in small quantities, generally for
salt.&rdquo; In the Ganjam M&#257;liahs, the jungles are said to be
searched by P&#257;nos for tasar cocoons, and, just across the border
in Boad, the collection of these cocoons is a regular industry among
them. Small portions of jungle are regularly reserved, and divided up
into small allotments. Each of these is given to a P&#257;no for rent,
and here he cultivates the silkworms, and collects the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>silk,
which is sent to Berhampur and Sambalpur for manufacture.</p>
<p>The P&#257;nos are divided into two distinct sections, viz., the
Khonda P&#257;nos who live amidst the Khonds, and the D&#275;sa
P&#257;nos of the plains. The former have adopted some of the customs
of the Khonds, while the latter follow the customs of the Uriya castes
which dwell in the lowland. The Khond P&#257;nos are governed by the
Molikos (headmen) of the Khonds. In some cases, the fines inflicted for
breach of caste rules are rather severe. For example, in the
neighbourhood of Baliguda, a man who is convicted of adultery has to
pay two rupees, and give two buffaloes to the council which tries the
case. Further south, for a similar offence twelve buffaloes are
demanded, and the culprit has to pay twice the amount of the
bride-price to the injured husband. The D&#275;sa P&#257;nos conform to
the standard Uriya type of caste council, and have a headman called
B&#275;hara, who is assisted by a N&#257;yako, and caste servants
entitled Bhollobaya or Gonj&#257;ri.</p>
<p>The marriage ceremonies of the D&#275;sa P&#257;nos are closely
allied to those of the Dand&#257;sis and Haddis, whereas those of the
Khonda P&#257;nos bear a close resemblance to the ceremonies of the
Khonds. Like Khond girls, unmarried Khond P&#257;no girls sleep in
quarters (dhangadi) specially set apart for them, and, as among the
Khonds, wedding presents in the form of gontis are given. It is noted
with reference to the Khonds, in the Ganjam Manual, that &ldquo;the
bride is looked upon as a commercial speculation, and is paid for in
gontis. A gonti is one of anything, such as a buffalo, a pig, or a
brass pot; for instance, a hundred gontis might consist of ten
bullocks, ten buffaloes, ten sacks of corn, ten sets of brass, twenty
sheep, ten pigs, and thirty fowls.&rdquo; At <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>a Khond
P&#257;no marriage, the fingers of the contracting couple are linked
together, and an important item of the ceremonial, which adds dignity
thereto, is placing in front of the house at which a marriage is being
celebrated a big brass vessel containing water, with which the guests
wash their feet.</p>
<p>The P&#257;nos pay reverence to ancestors, to whom, when a death
occurs in a family, food is offered. In some P&#257;no villages, when a
child is born, it is customary to consult a p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest)
as to whether the grandfather or great-grandfather is re-born in it. If
the answer is in the affirmative, pigs are sacrificed to the ancestors.
Some P&#257;nos have adopted the worship of T&#257;kur&#257;nis
(village deities), to whom rice and turmeric are offered by placing
them before the image in the form of a figure-of-eight. A fowl is
sacrificed, and its blood allowed to flow on to one loop of the figure.
In some places, Dharmad&#275;vata and Gagnasuni are worshipped, a
castrated goat being sacrificed annually to the former, and fowls and
an entire goat to the latter.</p>
<p>P&#257;no women, who live among the Khonds, tattoo their faces in
like manner, and in other respects resemble Khond women.</p>
<p>I am informed that, on more than one occasion, P&#257;nos have been
known to rifle the grave of a European, in the belief that buried
treasure will be found.</p>
<p><b>Panta</b> (a crop).&mdash;A sub-division of K&#257;pu and
Y&#257;n&#257;di. In the Gazetteer of South Arcot, Pan Reddi is
recorded as a caste of Telugu-speaking ryots (K&#257;pus).</p>
<p><b>Pantala.&mdash;</b>Recorded, in Travancore, as a sub-division of
S&#257;mantan. The name is said to be derived from Bhand&#257;rattil,
or belonging to the royal treasury.</p>
<p><b>Pant&#257;ri.&mdash;</b>Recorded, in the Travancore Census
Report, as synonymous with the Idacheri sub-division <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>of
N&#257;yar. Pantrantu V&#299;tan is also there recorded as a
sub-division of N&#257;yar.</p>
<p><b>Pappadam.&mdash;</b>People calling themselves Pappadam Chetti are
largely found in Malabar, living by the manufacture and sale of cakes
called pappadam, which are purchased by all classes, including
Namb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p><b>Pappini.&mdash;</b>A name for Br&#257;hmanis, a class of
Ambalav&#257;si.</p>
<p><b>Pappu</b> (split pulse).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Balija.</p>
<p><b>Parad&#275;si.&mdash;</b>Recorded, in the Madras Census Report,
1901, as a class of Malay&#257;lam beggars. The name indicates
strangers (parad&#275;sa, a foreign country), and is applied to the
White Jews of Cochin, in connection with whom it occurs in Sirkar
(State) accounts and royal writs granted to them.</p>
<p><b>Paraiya T&#257;da.&mdash;</b>Recorded, in the North Arcot Manual,
as a name for those who are considered impure Valluvans. The name
literally means Paraiya T&#257;dan or D&#257;sari.</p>
<p><b>Paraiyan.&mdash;</b>The Paraiyans or, as they are commonly
termed, Pariahs of the Tamil country number, according to recent census
returns, over two million souls, and a large proportion of those who
returned themselves as Native Christians are said also to belong to
this class. For the following note I am mainly indebted to an account
of the Paraiyans by the Rev. A. C. Clayton.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1385src" href="#xd21e1385" name="xd21e1385src">48</a></p>
<p>The late Bishop Caldwell derived the name Paraiyan from the Tamil
word parai a drum, as certain Paraiyans act as drummers at marriages,
funerals, village festivals, and on occasions when Government or
commercial announcements are proclaimed. Mr. H. A. Stuart, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>however,
seems to question this derivation, remarking<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1393src" href="#xd21e1393" name="xd21e1393src">49</a> that
&ldquo;it is only one section of Paraiyans that act as drummers. Nor is
the occupation confined to Paraiyans. It seems in the highest degree
improbable that a large, and at one time powerful, community should owe
its name to an occasional occupation, which one of its divisions shares
with other castes. The word Paraiyan is not found in Div&#257;karam, a
Tamil dictionary of the eleventh century A.D., and the word Pulayan was
then used to denote this section of the population, as it is still in
Malay&#257;lam to this day.&rdquo; In the legend of the Saivite saint,
Nandan is, in the prose version of the Periya Pur&#257;nam, called a
Pulayan, though a native of Sh&#333;lamandalam, which was a distinctly
Tamil kingdom. Mr. W. Francis writes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1396src" href="#xd21e1396" name="xd21e1396src">50</a> that
&ldquo;the old Tamil poems and works of the early centuries of the
Christian era do not mention the name Paraiyan, but contain many
descriptions of a tribe called the Eyinas, who seem to have been quite
distinct from the rest of the population, and did not live in the
villages, but in forts of their own. Amb&#363;r and Vellore are
mentioned as the sites of two of these. They may perhaps have been the
ancestors of the Paraiyans of to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the Paraiyans, Sonnerat, writing<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1401src" href="#xd21e1401" name="xd21e1401src">51</a> in the
eighteenth century, says that &ldquo;they are prohibited from drawing
water from the wells of other castes; but have particular wells of
their own near their inhabitations, round which they place the bones of
animals, that they may be known and avoided. When an Indian of any
other caste permits a Paraiya to speak to him, this unfortunate being
is obliged to hold his hand before his mouth, lest the Indian may be
contaminated with his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79"
name="pb79">79</a>]</span>breath; and, if he is met on the highway, he
must turn on one side to let the other pass. If any Indian whatever,
even a Choutre, by accident touches a Paraiya, he is obliged to purify
himself in a bath. The Br&#257;hmans cannot behold them, and they are
obliged to fly when they appear. Great care is taken not to eat
anything dressed by a Paraiya, nor even to drink out of the vessel he
has used; they dare not enter the house of an Indian of another caste;
or, if they are employed in any work, a door is purposely made for
them; but they must work with their eyes on the ground; for, if it is
perceived they have glanced at the kitchen, all the utensils must be
broken. The infamy of the Paraiyas is reflected on the Europeans: last
are held in more detestation, because, setting aside the little respect
they have for the cow, whose flesh they eat, the Indians reproach them
with spitting in their houses, and even their temples: that when
drinking they put the cup to their lips, and their fingers to their
mouths in such a manner that they are defiled with the
spittle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paraiyans are to be found throughout the Tamil districts from North
Arcot to Tinnevelly, and in the southern extremity of the Native State
of Travancore. In the Telugu country the M&#257;las and M&#257;digas
and in the Canarese country the Holeyas take their place.</p>
<p>Some of the most common names of Paraiyan males are&mdash;</p>

<li>Kanni or Kanniyappan.</li>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=

<p>Among females the most common names are Tai, Parpathi, Ammai, Kanni,
Muttamm&#257;l, R&#257;jamm&#257;l, Ammani, Selli, Gangamm&#257;l. In
one village, where the Paraiyans were almost all Vaishnavas, by
profession not by practice, Mr. Clayton found the inhabitants all named
after heroes of the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, and dirty naked children
answered to the names of Ikshv&#257;kan, Karnan, Bh&#299;man, and
Draupadi. It is usual to give the father&rsquo;s name when
distinguishing one Paraiyan from another, <i>e.g.</i>, Tamburan, son of
Kannan. In legal documents the prefix Para denotes a Paraiyan,
<i>e.g.</i>, Para Kanni, the Paraiyan Kanni, but this is a purely
clerical formula. The Paraiyan delights in nicknames, and men sometimes
grow so accustomed to these that they have almost forgotten their real
names. The following nicknames are very common :&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Nondi, lame.</li>
<li>Kallan, thief.</li>
<li>Kullan, dwarf.</li>
<li>Vellei, white or light complexioned.</li>
<li>Kannan, with eyes.</li>
<li>Muthalai, crocodile.</li>
<li>Kudiyan, drunkard.</li>
</ul>
<p>No name, indicating virtue or merit, is given, lest the wrath of
malevolent spirits should be aroused.</p>
<p>At the census, 1891, 348 sub-divisions were returned, of which the
following were strongest in point of numbers :&mdash;Amma found chiefly
in Tanjore and Madura; Katti in Salem and Trichinopoly;
K&#299;zhakkatti (eastern) in Salem; K&#333;liyan (weavers) in
Chingleput, Tanjore and Trichinopoly; Konga in Salem; Korava in
Coimbatore; K&#333;ttai (fort) in South Arcot; Morasu (drum) in Salem;
Mottai in Madura; Pacchai (green) in Coimbatore; S&#257;mb&#257;n in
South Arcot; Sangidum (sanku, conch, or chank shell) in Coimbatore;
S&#333;zhia (natives of the S&#333;zha or Ch&#333;la country) in
Tanjore and Madura; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81"
name="pb81">81</a>]</span>Tangal&#257;n in North and South Arcot,
Chingleput, Salem, and Trichinopoly; and Valangamattu in South Arcot.
The members of the various sub-divisions do not intermarry.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e1473width" id="pl6-081"><img src=

</div>
<p>It has been suggested to me that the Morasu Paraiyans, included in
the above list, are Canarese Holeyas, who have settled in the Tamil
country. In the south their women, like the Kallans, wear a horsehair
thread round the neck. As additional sub-divisions, the following may
be noted :&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Aruththukatt&#257;tha</i>, or those who, having once cut the
t&#257;li-string, do not tie it a second time, <i>i.e.</i>, those who
do not permit remarriage of widows.</p>
<p><i>Valai</i> (a net).&mdash;Paraiyans who hunt.</p>
<p><i>Sanku</i> (conch-shell).&mdash;Those who act as conch-blowers at
funerals.</p>
<p><i>Th&#257;tha.</i>&mdash;Th&#257;than is the name given to
mendicants who profess Vaishnavism. Such Paraiyans are Vaishnavites,
and some are beggars.</p>
<p>In the Census Report, 1901, Mr. Francis notes that the term Paraiyan
&ldquo;is now almost a generic one, and the caste is split up into many
sub-divisions, which differ in manners and ways. For example, the
K&#333;liyans, who are weavers, and the Valluvans, who are medicine men
and priests and wear the sacred thread, will not intermarry or eat with
the others, and are now practically distinct castes.&rdquo; As
occupational titles of Paraiyans Mr. Francis gives Urumikk&#257;ran and
Pambaikk&#257;ran, or those who play on drums (urumi and pambai), and
Podarayan or Podara Vann&#257;n, who are washermen. The title
Valangamatt&#257;n, or people of the right-hand division, is assumed by
some Paraiyans.</p>
<p>Mr. Clayton states that he knows of no legend or popular belief
among the Paraiyans, indicating that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>they believe themselves
to have come from any other part of the country than that where they
now find themselves. There is, however, some evidence that the race has
had a long past, and one in which they had independence, and possibly
great importance in the peninsula. Mr. Stuart mentions<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1505src" href="#xd21e1505" name=
"xd21e1505src">52</a> that the Valluvans were priests to the Pallava
kings before the introduction of the Br&#257;hmans, and even for some
time after it. He quotes an unpublished Vatteluttu inscription,
believed to be of the ninth century, in which it is noted that
&ldquo;Sr&#299; Valluvam Puvanavan, the Uvacchan (or temple
ministrant), will employ six men daily, and do the temple
service.&rdquo; The inference is that the Valluvan was a man of
recognised priestly rank, and of great influence. The prefix Sr&#299;
is a notable honorific. By itself this inscription would prove little,
but the whole legendary history of the greatest of all Tamil poets,
Tiruvalluvar, &ldquo;the holy Valluvan,&rdquo; confirms all that can be
deduced from it. His date can only be fixed approximately, but it is
probable that he flourished not later than the tenth century A.D. It is
safe to say that this extraordinary sage could not have attained the
fame he did, or have received the honours that were bestowed upon him,
had not the Valluvans, and therefore the Paraiyans, been in the circle
of respectable society in his day. This conjecture is strengthened by
the legend that he married a Vell&#257;la girl. The same hypothesis is
the only one that will account for the education and the vogue of the
sister of the poet, the aphoristic poetess Avvei.</p>
<p>In the Census Report, 1901, Mr. Francis mentions an inscription of
the Ch&#333;la King R&#257;ja R&#257;ja, dated about the eleventh
century A.D., in which the Paraiyan caste is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>called
by its own name. It had then two sub-divisions, the Nesavu or weavers,
and Ulavu or ploughmen. The caste had even then its own hamlets, wells
and burning-grounds.</p>
<p>There are certain privileges possessed by Paraiyans, which they
could never have gained for themselves from orthodox Hinduism. They
seem to be survivals of a past, in which Paraiyans held a much higher
position than they do now. It is noted by Mr. M. J. Walhouse<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1515src" href="#xd21e1515" name=
"xd21e1515src">53</a> that &ldquo;in the great festival of Siva at
Trival&#363;r in Tanjore the headman of the Par&#275;yars is mounted on
the elephant with the god, and carries his chauri (yak-tail fly fan).
In Madras, at the annual festival of Egatta, the goddess of the
Black,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1518src" href="#xd21e1518" name=
"xd21e1518src">54</a> now George, Town, when a t&#257;li is tied round
the neck of the idol in the name of the entire community, a
Par&#275;yan is chosen to represent the bridegroom. At M&#275;lkotta in
Mysore, the chief seat of the followers of R&#257;m&#257;nuja
Ach&#257;rya, and at the Br&#257;hman temple at B&#275;lur, the
Hol&#275;yas or Par&#275;yars have the right of entering the temple on
three days in the year specially set apart for them.&rdquo; At
M&#275;lkote, the Holeyas and M&#257;digas are said to have been
granted the privilege of entering the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i> along
with Br&#257;hmans and others on three days by R&#257;m&#257;nuja. In
1799, however, the right to enter the temple was stopped at the
dhvajastambham, or consecrated monolithic column. At both B&#275;lur
and M&#275;lkote, as soon as the festival is over, the temples are
ceremonially purified. At Sr&#299;perumbud&#363;r in the Chingleput
district, the Paraiyans enjoy a similar privilege to those at
Tiruval&#363;r, in return for having sheltered an image of the
locally-worshipped <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84"
name="pb84">84</a>]</span>incarnation of Vishnu during a Muhammadan
raid. It is noted by Mr. Stuart that the lower village offices, the
Vettiyan, Tali&#257;ri, Dand&#257;si or B&#257;rike, and the T&#333;ti,
are, in the majority of Madras villages, held by persons of the
Paraiyan caste. Paraiyans are allowed to take part in pulling the cars
of the idols in the great festivals at Conjeeveram, Kumbak&#333;nam,
and Sr&#299;villiputt&#363;r. Their touch is not reckoned to defile the
ropes used, so that other Hindus will pull with them. With this may be
compared the fact that the Telugu M&#257;las are custodians of the
goddess Gauri, the bull Nandi, and Gan&#275;sa, the chief gods of the
Saiva K&#257;pus and Balijas. It may also be noted that the
K&#333;matis, who claim to be Vaisyas, are bound to invite M&#257;digas
to their marriages, though they take care that the latter do not hear
the invitation. Mr. Clayton records that he has heard
well-authenticated instances of Br&#257;hman women worshipping at
Paraiyan shrines in order to procure children, and states that he once
saw a Paraiyan exorciser treating a Br&#257;hman by uttering mantrams
(consecrated formul&aelig;), and waving a sickle up and down the
sufferer&rsquo;s back, as he stood in a threshing floor.</p>
<p>In a note on the Paraiyans of the Trichinopoly district, Mr. F. R.
Hemingway writes as follows. &ldquo;They have a very exalted account of
their lineage, saying that they are descended from the Br&#257;hman
priest S&#257;la S&#257;mbavan, who was employed in a Siva temple to
worship the god with offerings of beef, but who incurred the anger of
the god by one day concealing a portion of the meat, to give it to his
pregnant wife, and was therefore turned into a Paraiyan. The god
appointed his brother to do duty instead of him, and the Paraiyans say
that Br&#257;hman priests are their cousins. For this reason they wear
a sacred thread at their marriages and funerals. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>At the
festival of the village goddesses, they repeat an extravagant praise of
their caste, which runs as follows. &lsquo;The Paraiyans were the first
creation, the first who wore the sacred thread, the uppermost in the
social scale, the differentiators of castes, the winners of laurels.
They have been seated on the white elephant, the V&#299;ra
S&#257;mbavans who beat the victorious drum.&rsquo; It is a curious
fact that, at the feast of the village goddess, a Paraiyan is honoured
by being invested with a sacred thread for the occasion by the
p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest) of the temple, by having a turmeric thread
tied to his wrists, and being allowed to head the procession. This, the
Paraiyans say, is owing to their exalted origin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In times of drought some of the lower orders, instead of addressing
their prayers to the rain god Varuna, try to induce a spirit or
d&#275;vata named Kodump&#257;vi (wicked one) to send her paramour
Sukra to the affected area. The belief seems to be that Sukra goes away
to his concubine for about six months, and, if he does not then return,
drought ensues. The ceremony consists in making a huge figure of
Kodump&#257;vi in clay, which is placed on a cart, and dragged through
the streets for seven to ten days. On the last day, the final death
ceremonies of the figure are celebrated. It is disfigured, especially
in those parts which are usually concealed. Vettiyans (Paraiyan
grave-diggers), who have been shaved, accompany the figure, and perform
the funeral ceremonies. This procedure is believed to put
Kodump&#257;vi to shame, and to get her to induce Sukra to return, and
stay the drought. Paraiyans are said<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1532src" href="#xd21e1532" name="xd21e1532src">55</a> to wail as
though they were at a funeral, and to beat drums in the funeral time.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Paraiyans are said by Mr. Francis<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1538src" href="#xd21e1538" name="xd21e1538src">56</a> to have a
curious share in the ceremonies in connection with the annual buffalo
sacrifice at the K&#257;li shrine at Mangalam in South Arcot.
&ldquo;Eight men of this community are chosen from eight adjoining
villages, and one of them is selected as leader. His wife must not be
with child at the&rsquo; time, and she is made to prove that she is
above all suspicion by undergoing the ordeal of thrusting her hand into
boiling gingelly (<i>Sesamum</i>) oil. On each of ten days for which
the festival lasts, this Paraiyan has to go round some part of the
boundaries of the eight villages, and he is fed gratis by the villagers
during this time. On the day of the sacrifice itself, he marches in
front of the priest as the latter kills the buffaloes. The Paraiyans of
the eight villages have the right to the carcases of the slaughtered
animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Paraiyans know the village boundaries better than anyone else,
and are very expert in this matter, unerringly pointing out where
boundaries should run, even when the Government demarcation stones are
completely overgrown by prickly-pear, or have been removed. Mr. Stuart
records a custom which prevails in some parts of making a Paraiyan walk
the boundaries of a field with a pot of water on his head, when there
is any dispute about their exact position. He thinks that the only
satisfactory explanation of this is that the connection of the
Paraiyans with the soil is of much longer standing than that of other
castes. The admitted proprietary right which Paraiyans have in the site
known as ch&#275;ri-nattam, on which their huts stand, is a
confirmation of this. These sites are entered as such on the official
village maps. They cannot be taken from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>Paraiyans, and date from time immemorial.
Throughout the whole of the Tamil country it is usual to find that the
land allotted for house-site (nattam) is in two portions in every
village (&#362;r). One part is known by the Sanskrit name gr&#257;mam
(village), the inhabited place. The other is called by the Dravidian
name ch&#275;ri (gathering place).</p>
<p>Sometimes the latter is called by the fuller title parach&#275;ri
(Anglice parcheri, parcherry), <i>i.e.</i>, the gathering place of the
Paraiyans. In the gr&#257;mam live the Br&#257;hmans, who sometimes
dwell, in a quarter by themselves known as the agrah&#257;ra, and also
other Hindus. In the parach&#275;ri live the Paraiyans. The
parach&#275;ri and the gr&#257;mam are always separated, at least by a
road or lane, and often by several fields. And not only is it usual
thus to find that, in every village, the Paraiyans as a community
possess a house-site, but there are many cases in which more than one
ch&#275;ri is attached to a gr&#257;mam. This seems to repudiate the
suggestion that at some period or periods the higher castes relegated
the Paraiyans to these ch&#275;ris. Indeed, in some cases, the very
names of the ch&#275;ris suggest what appears to be the more correct
view, viz., that the ch&#275;ris had a distinct origin. For instance,
the whole revenue village of Teiyar near Chingleput consists of one
S&#363;dra gr&#257;mam and seven Paraiyan ch&#275;ris, each with a name
of its own, Periyapill&#275;ri, Komanch&#275;ri, etc. In other cases,
<i>e.g.</i>, Ideip&#257;layam in the north of the district, and
Varadar&#257;japuram near Vandal&#363;r, only Paraiyan hamlets exist;
there is no gr&#257;mam. In South Arcot there are at least two
villages, Govindanall&#363;r and Andapet, inhabited only by Paraiyans,
where even the Maniyakk&#257;ran (munsiff or village headman) is a
Paraiyan. Other instances might be quoted in proof of the same opinion.
And, when the ceremonial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href=
"#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>antipathy between Br&#257;hman and
Paraiyan is examined, it points in the same direction. It is well known
that a Br&#257;hman considers himself polluted by the touch, presence,
or shadow of a Paraiyan, and will not allow him to enter his house, or
even the street in which he lives, if it is an agr&#257;h&#257;ra. But
it is not so well known that the Paraiyans will not allow a
Br&#257;hman to enter the ch&#275;ri. Should a Br&#257;hman venture
into the Paraiyan&rsquo;s quarter, water with which cow-dung has been
mixed is thrown on his head, and he is driven out. It is
stated<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1558src" href="#xd21e1558" name=
"xd21e1558src">57</a> by Captain J. S. F. Mackenzie that
&ldquo;Br&#257;hmans in Mysore consider that great luck will await them
if they can manage to pass through the Holeya quarter of a village
unmolested, and that, should a Br&#257;hman attempt to enter their
quarters, they turn out in a body and slipper him, in former times it
is said to death.&rdquo; Some Br&#257;hmans consider a forsaken
parach&#275;ri an auspicious site for an agr&#257;h&#257;ra. A very
peculiar case is that of the gr&#257;mam founded for, and occupied by
the clerks of the earliest Collectors (district magistrates) of the
jagir of Karunguli from 1795 to 1825 A.D. These clerks were
Br&#257;hmans, and it was called the agr&#257;h&#257;ram. It was
deserted when the head-quarters of the Collector were removed to
Conjeeveram. It is now occupied by Paraiyans, but is still called the
agr&#257;h&#257;ram.</p>
<p>The facts, taken together, seem to show that the Paraiyan priests
(Valluvans), and therefore the Paraiyans as a race, are very ancient,
that ten centuries ago they were a respectable community, and that many
were weavers. The privileges they enjoy are relics of an exceedingly
long association with the land. The institution of the parach&#275;ri
points to original independence, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89"
href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>and even to possession of much
of the land. If the account of the colonisation of Tondeimandalam by
Vell&#257;lans in the eighth century A.D. is historic, then it is
possible that at that time the Paraiyans lost the land, and that their
degradation as a race began.</p>
<p>The Paraiyans have long been a settled race. And, though a number of
them emigrate to Ceylon, Mauritius, South Africa, the West Indies, the
Straits Settlements, and even to Fiji, the vast majority live and die
within a mile or two of the spot where they were born. The houses in
which they live are not temporary erections, or intended for use during
certain seasons of the year only. The rudest form is a hut made by
tying a few leaves of the palmyra palm on to a framework of poles or
bamboos. The better class of houses are a series of rooms with low mud
walls and thatched roof, but generally without doors, surrounding a
small courtyard, in which the family goats, buffaloes, and fowls have
their homes. The cooking is done anywhere where it is convenient either
indoors or out, as there is no fear of pollution from the glance or
shadow of any passer-by. Very occasionally the walls of the house,
especially those facing the street, are whitewashed, or decorated with
variegated patterns or figures in red and white. Paraiya women, like
higher caste women, are much given to tracing exceedingly intricate
symmetrical designs (k&#333;lam) with rice flour on the smooth space or
pathway immediately before the doors of their houses, it is said, to
prevent the entrance of evil spirits. Mr. S. P. Rice writes to me that
the patterns on the floor or threshold are generally traced with white
powder, <i>e.g.</i>, chalk, as rice is too costly; and that the
original object of the custom was not to drive away evil spirits, but
to provide food for the lowest creatures of creation&mdash;ants,
insects, etc. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>Admissions to the Paraiyan caste from higher castes sometimes occur.
Mr. Clayton records having met an Aiyangar Br&#257;hman who was working
as a cooly with some Paraiyan labourers at Kodaik&#257;nal on the Palni
hills. He had become infatuated with a Paraiya woman, and had
consequently been excommunicated, and became a Paraiyan.</p>
<p>In every Paraiya settlement a small number of the more important men
are known as Panakk&#257;ran (money-man). The application of the term
may, Mr. Clayton suggests, be due to their comparative opulence, or may
have arisen from the custom of paying them a small sum (panam) for
various services to the community. But Panikkar or Panakkar is usually
said to be derived from pani, meaning work. They form a committee or
council to decide ordinary quarrels, and to amerce the damages in cases
of assault, seduction, rape, and adultery. They have power to dissolve
marriages on account of the wife, or if the husband has deserted his
wife. In these cases their authority is really based on the public
opinion of the parach&#275;ri, and goes no further than that public
opinion will enforce it. There is no headman in a Paraiya hamlet
corresponding to the munsiff or village magistrate of the Hindu village
(gr&#257;ma). In modern practice the Paraiyans are, for police
purposes, under the authority of the munsiff of the gr&#257;ma, and
there is a growing tendency on their part to refer all disputes and
assaults to the munsiff, or even directly to the police. On the other
hand, cases of a more domestic nature, such as disputes about
betrothals, seduction, etc., are still dealt with, generally acutely
and fairly, by the village council. It should be added that the rank of
Panakk&#257;ran is hereditary, and is regarded as honourable.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Paraiyans, like all the other right-hand castes, come under the
jurisdiction of the D&#275;s&#257;yi Chettis, who have held a sort of
censorship since the days of the Naw&#257;bs of Arcot over some
twenty-four of these right-hand castes, chiefly in North Arcot. The
D&#275;s&#257;yi Chetti has nominal power to deal with all moral
offences, and is supposed to have a representative in every village,
who reports every offence. But, though his authority is great in North
Arcot, and the fines levied there bring in an income of hundreds of
rupees yearly, it is not so much dreaded in other districts. The
punishment usually inflicted is a fine, but sometimes a delinquent
Paraiyan will be made to crawl on his hands and knees on the ground
between the legs of a Paraiya woman as a final humiliation. The
punishment of excommunication, <i>i.e.</i>, cutting off from fire and
water, is sometimes the fate of the recalcitrant, either before the
council or the D&#275;s&#257;yi Chetti, but it is seldom effective for
more than a short time. Mr. K. Rangachari adds that, in certain places,
the D&#275;s&#257;yi Chetti appoints the Panakk&#257;ran, who is
subordinate to the D&#275;s&#257;yi, and that a man called the Variyan
or Shalav&#257;thi is sometimes appointed as assistant to the
Panakk&#257;ran. He also mentions some other punishments. The fine for
adultery is from 7 pagodas 14 fanams to 11 pagodas, when the wronged
woman is unmarried. If she is married, the amount ranges from 12
pagodas 14 fanams to 16 pagodas. The fine is said to be divided between
the woman, her husband, the members of council, and the
Panakk&#257;rans. Formerly an offender against the Paraiyan community
was tied to a post at the beginning of his trial, and, if found guilty,
was beaten. He might escape the flogging by paying a fine of two fanams
per stripe. Sometimes a delinquent is paraded through the hamlet,
carrying a rubbish basket, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href=
"#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>or is ordered to make a heap of
rubbish at a certain spot. Or a cord is passed from one big toe over
the bowed neck of the culprit, and tied to his other big toe, and then
a stone is placed on his bent back. In some places, when an unmarried
woman is convicted of adultery, she is publicly given a new cloth and a
bit of straw or a twig, apparently in mockery. It is said that
formerly, if the chastity of a bride was suspected, she had to pick
some cakes out of boiling oil. This she had to do just after the
t&#257;li had been tied in the wedding ceremony. Her hair, nails, and
clothes were examined, to see that she had no charm concealed. After
lifting the cakes from the oil, she had to husk some rice with her bare
hand. If she could do this, her virtue was established. In the South
Arcot district, according to Mr. Francis,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1584src" href="#xd21e1584" name="xd21e1584src">58</a> the
Paraiyans &ldquo;have caste headmen called the Periya (big) Natt&#257;n
and the Chinna (little) Natt&#257;n or Tangal&#257;n (our man), whose
posts are usually hereditary. The Tangal&#257;n carries out the
sentence of caste panchayats, administering a thrashing to the accused
for example, if such be the order of the court. Of the fines inflicted
by these assemblies, a fifth is usually handed over to the local
M&#257;riamma shrine, and the remaining four-fifths are laid out in
drinks for the panchayatdars. Until recently, a part of the fine was in
some cases, in these parts, paid to the local poligar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Excommunicated Paraiyans are said to go to a mythical place called
Vinnamangalam. In some documents signed by Paraiyans, the words
&ldquo;If I fail to fulfil the conditions of our agreement, I shall go
to Vinnamangalam&rdquo; are inserted. In all enquiries by the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>police, the council, or the D&#275;s&#257;yi
Chetti, the Paraiyan only tells what in his opinion it is expedient to
tell. But evidence given after burning a piece of camphor is said to be
reliable.</p>
<p>The attainment of puberty by girls is a subject of greedy curiosity
to most of the women in a Paraiya village. This has been said to be due
to the fact that &ldquo;the menstrual fluid is held in horror, dire
consequences being supposed to result from not merely the contact, but
even the very sight of it. Hence the isolation and purification of
women during the menstrual period, and the extreme care and anxiety
with which the first approach of puberty in a girl is watched.&rdquo;
The girl at once begins to wear a covering of some sort, even it be the
most pathetic rag, over her left shoulder and breast. Till this time, a
bit of cotton cloth round her waist has been considered sufficient.
Among the Tangal&#257;n Paraiyans, when a girl attains puberty, she is
kept apart either in the house or in a separate hut. Pollution is
supposed to last eight days. On the ninth day, the girl is bathed, and
seated in the courtyard. Ten small lamps of flour paste (called drishti
m&#257;vu vilakku), to avert the evil eye, are put on a sieve, and
waved before her three times. Then coloured water (&#257;rati or alam)
and burning camphor are waved before her. Some near female relatives
then stand behind her, and strike her waist and sides with puttu (flour
cake) tied in a cloth. This is believed to make her strong. At the same
time other women strike the ground behind the girl with a rice-pestle.
Then presents are given to the girl. In some places the girl is beaten
within the house by her mother-in-law or paternal aunt. The latter
repeatedly asks the girl to promise that her daughter shall marry her
paternal aunt&rsquo;s son. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href=
"#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>In marriages among the Paraiyans, difference in religion is of
little moment. A Christian Paraiyan will marry a heathen girl, though
it should be said that she is usually baptised at or about the time of
the marriage. A Christian girl is sometimes married to a heathen
Paraiyan. Mr. Clayton thinks that the fact that certain Paraiyans paint
the n&#257;mam of Vishnu on their foreheads, while others smear their
foreheads with the ashes of Siva, prevents marriages between them.</p>
<p>The bridegroom must be older than the bride. Subject to this
condition, it is usual for a youth to marry his father&rsquo;s
sister&rsquo;s daughter, or his mother&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s
daughter. A girl should be married to her mother&rsquo;s
brother&rsquo;s son if he is old enough, but not, as among the Konga
Vell&#257;las and some Reddis, if he is a child. In short, Paraiyans
follow the usual Tamil custom, but it is often neglected.</p>
<p>Marriage contracts are sometimes made by parents while the parties
most concerned are still infants, often while they are still children;
in the majority of cases when the girl attains the marriageable age.
The bridegroom may be many years older than the bride, especially when
custom, as noted above, settles who shall be his bride. The bride has
absolutely no choice in the matter; but, if the bridegroom is a man of
some years or position, his preferences are consulted. The elder sister
should be given in marriage before her younger sisters are married. The
arrangements are more or less a bargain. Presents of clothes, paltry
jewels, rice, vegetables, and perhaps a few rupees, are exchanged
between the families of the bride and bridegroom. The household that
seeks the marriage naturally gives the larger gifts. The actual
marriage ceremony is very simple. The essential part is the tying of a
small token <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>or ornament (t&#257;li), varying in value from a
few annas to four or five rupees by a turmeric-stained string, round
the neck of the bride. This is done by the bridegroom in the presence
of a Valluvan, who mutters some kind of blessing on the marriage. A
series of feasts, lasting over two or three days, is given to all the
relatives of both parties by the parents of the newly-married couple.
The bride and bridegroom do not live together immediately, even if the
girl is old enough. The exact date at which their life together may
begin is settled by the bride&rsquo;s mother. The occasion, called
soppana muhurtham, is celebrated by another feast and much
merry-making, not always seemly.</p>

</div>
<p>The following detailed account of the marriage ceremonies among the
Tangal&#257;n Paraiyans was furnished by Mr. K. Rangachari. The parents
or near relations of the contracting parties meet, and talk over the
match. If an agreement is arrived at, an adjournment is made to the
nearest liquor shop, and a day fixed for the formal exchange of betel
leaves, which is the sign of a binding engagement. A Paraiyan, when he
goes to seek the hand of a girl in marriage, will not eat at her house
if her family refuse to consider the alliance, to which the consent of
the girl&rsquo;s maternal uncle is essential. The Paraiyan is
particular in the observation of omens, and, if a cat or a valiyan (a
bird) crosses his path when he sets out in quest of a bride, he will
give her up. The betrothal ceremony, or pariyam, is binding as long as
the contracting couple are alive. They may live together as man and
wife without performing the marriage ceremony, and children born to
them are considered as legitimate. But, when their offspring marry, the
parents must first go through the marriage rites, and the children are
then married in the same pandal on the same day. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>At the
betrothal ceremony, the headman, father, maternal uncle, and two near
relations of the bridegroom-elect, proceed to the girl&rsquo;s house,
where they are received, and sit on seats or mats. Drink and plantain
fruits are offered to them. Some conversation takes place between the
headmen of the two parties, such as &ldquo;Have you seen the girl? Have
you seen her house and relations? Are you disposed to recommend and
arrange the match?&rdquo; If he assents, the girl&rsquo;s headman says
&ldquo;As long as stones and the K&#257;veri river exist, so that the
sky goddess Ak&#257;sav&#257;ni and the earth goddess
Bh&#363;mad&#275;vi may know it; so that the water-pot (used at the
marriage ceremony), and the sun and moon may know it; so that this
assembly may know it; I ... give this girl.&rdquo; The headman of the
bridegroom then says &ldquo;The girl shall be received into the house
by marriage. These thirty-six pieces of gold are yours, and the girl is
mine.&rdquo; He then hands betel leaves and areca nuts to the other
headman, who returns them. The exchange of betel is carried out three
times. Near the headmen is placed a tray containing betel nuts, a
rupee, a turmeric-dyed cloth in which a fanam (2&frac12; annas) is
tied, a cocoanut, flowers, and the bride&rsquo;s money varying in
amount from seven to twenty rupees. The fanam and bride&rsquo;s money
are handed to the headman of the girl, and the rupee is divided between
the two headmen. On the betrothal day, the relations of the girl offer
flowers, cocoanuts, etc., to their ancestors, who are supposed to be
without food or drink. The Paraiyans believe that the ancestors will be
ill-disposed towards them, if they are not propitiated with offerings
of rice and other things. For the purpose of worship, the ancestors are
represented by a number of cloths kept in a box made of bamboo or other
material, to which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97"
name="pb97">97</a>]</span>the offerings are made. On the conclusion of
the ancestor worship, the two headmen go to a liquor shop, and exchange
drinks of toddy. This exchange is called mel sambandham kural, or
proclaiming relationship. After the lapse of a few days, the
girl&rsquo;s family is expected to pay a return visit, and the party
should include at least seven men. Betel is again exchanged, and the
guests are fed, or presented with a small gift of money. When marriage
follows close on betrothal, the girl is taken to the houses of her
relations, and goes through the nalugu ceremony, which consists of
smearing her with turmeric paste, an oil bath, and presentation of
betel and sweets. The auspicious day and hour for the marriage are
fixed by the Valluvan, or priest of the Paraiyans. The ceremonial is
generally carried through in a single day. On the morning of the
wedding day, three male and two married female relations of the
bridegroom go to the potter&rsquo;s house to fetch the pots, which have
been already ordered. The potter&rsquo;s fee is a fowl, pumpkin, paddy,
betel, and a few annas. The bride, accompanied by the headman and her
relations, goes to the bridegroom&rsquo;s village, bringing with her a
number of articles called petti varisai or box presents. These consist
of a lamp, cup, brass vessel, ear-ornament called kal&#257;ppu,
twenty-five betel leaves and areca nuts, onions, and cakes, a lump of
jaggery (crude sugar), grass mat, silver toe-ring, rice, a bundle of
betel leaves and five cocoanuts, which are placed inside a bamboo box.
The next item in the proceedings is the erection of the milk-post,
which is made of a pestle of tamarind or <i>Soymida febrifuga</i> wood,
or a green bamboo. To the post leafy twigs of the mango or p&#299;pal
(<i>Ficus religiosa</i>) are tied. In some places, a pole of the
<i>Odina Wodier</i> tree is said to be set up, and afterwards planted
near the house, to see if it will grow. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>Near the marriage dais a
pit is dug, into which are thrown nine kinds of grain, and milk is
poured. The milk-post is supported on a grindstone painted with
turmeric stripes, washed with milk and cow&rsquo;s urine, and
worshipped, with the Valluvan as the celebrant priest. The post is then
set up in the pit by three men and two women. A string with a bit of
turmeric (kankanam) is tied to the milk-post, and to it and the dais
boiled rice is offered. Kankanams are also tied round the wrists of the
bride and bridegroom. The bridegroom&rsquo;s party go to the temple or
house where the bride is awaiting them, bringing with them a brass
lamp, vessel and cup, castor and gingelly oil, combs, confectionery,
turmeric, and betel leaves. The procession is headed by Paraiyans
beating tom-toms, and blowing on trumpets. When their destination is
reached, all take their seats on mats, and the various articles which
they have brought are handed over to the headman, who returns them. The
bride is then taken in procession to the marriage house, which she is
the first to enter. She is then told to touch with her right hand some
paddy, salt, and rice, placed in three pots inside the house. Touching
them with the left hand would be an evil omen, and every mishap which
might occur in the family would be traced to the new daughter-in-law.
The bride and bridegroom next go through the nalugu ceremony, and some
of the relations proceed with the ceremony of bringing sand (manal
v&#257;ri sadangu). A cousin of the bridegroom and his wife take three
pots called s&#257;l karagam and k&#363;res&#257;l, and repair to a
river, tank (pond) or well, accompanied by a few men and women. The
pots are set on the ground, and close to them are placed a lamp, and a
leaf with cakes, betel leaves and nuts set on it. P&#363;ja (worship)
is made to the pots by burning camphor and breaking cocoanuts.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>The Vettiyan then says &ldquo;The sun, the moon,
the pots, and the owner of the girl have come to the pandal. So make
haste and fill the pot with water.&rdquo; The woman dips a small pot in
water, and, after putting some sand or mud into a big pot, pours the
water therein. The pots are then again worshipped. After the
performance of the nalugu, the bridal couple go through a ceremony for
removing the evil eye, called &ldquo;sige kazhippu.&rdquo; A leaf of
<i>Ficus religiosa</i>, with its tail downwards, is held over their
foreheads, and all the close relations pour water over it, so that it
trickles over their faces; or seven cakes are placed by each of the
relations on the head, shoulders, knees, feet, and other parts of the
body of the bridegroom. The cakes are subsequently given to a
washerman. The parents of the bridal couple, accompanied by some of
their relations, next proceed to an open field, taking with them the
cloths, t&#257;li, jewels, and other things which have been purchased
for the wedding. A cloth is laid on the ground, and on it seven leaves
are placed, and cooked rice, vegetables, etc., heaped up thereon.
P&#363;ja is done, and a goat is sacrificed to the ancestors
(Tangalanmar). By some the offerings are made to the village goddess
Pid&#257;ri, instead of to the ancestors. Meanwhile the bridegroom has
been taken in procession round the village on horseback, and the
headmen have been exchanging betel in the pandal. On the
bridegroom&rsquo;s return, he and the bride seat themselves on planks
placed on the dais, and are garlanded by their maternal uncle with
wreaths of <i>Nerium odorum</i> flowers. The maternal uncle of the
bride presents her with a ring. In some places, the bride is carried to
the dais on the shoulders or in the arms of the maternal uncle. While
the couple are seated on the dais the Valluvan priest lights the sacred
fire (h&#333;mam), and, repeating some words in corrupt Sanskrit, pours
gingelly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>oil into the fire. He then does p&#363;ja to the
t&#257;li, and passes it round, to be touched and blessed by those
assembled. The bridegroom, taking up the t&#257;li, shows it through a
hole in the pandal to the sky or sun, and, on receipt of permission
from those present, ties it round the neck of the bride. Thin plates of
gold or silver, called pattam, are then tied on the foreheads of the
contracting couple, first by the mother-in-law and sister-in-law. With
Br&#257;hman and non-Br&#257;hman castes it is customary for the bride
and bridegroom to fast until the t&#257;li has been tied. With
Paraiyans, on the contrary, the rite is performed after a good meal.
Towards the close of the marriage day, fruit, flowers, and betel are
placed on a tray before the couple, and all the kankanams, seven in
number, are removed, and put on the tray. After burning camphor, the
bridegroom hands the tray to his wife, and it is exchanged between them
three times. It is then given to the washerman. The proceedings
terminate by the two going with linked hands three times round the
pandal. On the following day, the bride&rsquo;s relatives purchase some
good curds, a number of plantains, sugar and pepper, which are mixed
together. All assemble at the pandal, and some of the mixture is given
to the headman, the newly married couple, and all who are present. All
the articles which constitute the bride&rsquo;s dowry are then placed
in the pandal, and examined by the headman. If they are found to be
correct, he proclaims the union of the couple, and more of the mixture
is doled out. This ceremony is known as sambandham k&#363;ral or
sambandham piriththal (proclaiming relationship). Two or three days
after the marriage, the bridegroom goes to the house of the bride, and
remains there for three days. He is stopped at the entrance by his
brother-in-law, who washes his feet, puts rings on <span class=

second toe, and keeps on pinching his feet until he has extracted a
promise that the bridegroom will give his daughter, if one is born to
him, in marriage to the son of his brother-in-law. The ring is put on
the foot of the bride by her maternal uncle at the time of the marriage
ceremony, after the wrist threads have been removed. In some places it
is done by the mother-in-law or sister-in-law, before the t&#257;li is
tied, behind a screen.</p>
<p>Polygamy is not common among the Paraiyans, but Mr. Clayton has
known a few instances in which a Paraiyan had two regularly married
wives, each wearing a t&#257;li. But it is very common to find that a
Paraiyan has, in addition to his formally married wife, another woman
who occupies a recognised position in his household. The first wears
the t&#257;li. The other woman does not, but is called the second wife.
She cannot be dismissed without the sanction of the parach&#275;ri
council. The man who maintains her is called her husband, and her
children are recognised as part of his family. Mr. Clayton believes
that a second wife is usually taken only when the more formally married
wife has no children, or when an additional worker is wanted in the
house, or to help in the daily work. Thus a horsekeeper will often have
two wives, one to prepare his meals and boil the gram for the horse,
the other to go out day by day to collect grass for the horse. The
Tamil proverb &ldquo;The experience of a man with two wives is
anguish&rdquo; applies to all these double unions. There are constant
quarrels between the two women, and the man is generally involved,
often to his own great inconvenience. It is quite common for a Paraiyan
to marry his deceased wife&rsquo;s sister, if she is not already
married.</p>
<p>A Paraiya woman usually goes to her mother&rsquo;s house a month or
two before she expects the birth of her first <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>child, which is born there. Sometimes a medicine
woman (maruttuvacchi), who possesses or professes some knowledge of
drugs and midwifery, is called in, if the case is a bad one. Generally
her barbarous treatment is but additional torture to the patient.
Immediately after the birth of the child, the mother drinks a decoction
called kash&#257;yam, in which there is much ginger. Hence the Tamil
proverb &ldquo;Is there any decoction without ginger in it?&rdquo;
About a week after the birth, the mother, as a purificatory ceremony,
is rubbed with oil and bathed.</p>
<p>Among S&#363;dras there is a family ceremony, to which the Sanskrit
name Simanta has been assigned, though it is not the true Simanta
observed by Br&#257;hmans. It occurs only in connection with a first
pregnancy. The expectant mother stands bending over a rice mortar, and
water or human milk is poured on her back by her husband&rsquo;s elder
or younger sister. Money is also given to buy jewels for the expected
child. The ceremony is of no interest to anyone outside the family.
Hence the proverb &ldquo;Come, ye villagers, and pour water on this
woman&rsquo;s back.&rdquo; This is used when outsiders are called in to
do for a member of a family what the relatives ought to do. This
ceremony is sometimes observed by Paraiyans. Among Br&#257;hmans it is
believed to affect the sex of the child. It should be added that it is
firmly believed that, if a woman dies during pregnancy or in childbed,
her spirit becomes an exceedingly malignant ghost, and haunts the
precincts of the village where she dies.</p>
<p>A widow does not wear the t&#257;li, which is removed at a gathering
of relatives some days after her husband&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;The
removal of the t&#257;li of a widow,&rdquo; Mr. Francis
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1648src" href="#xd21e1648" name=
"xd21e1648src">59</a> &ldquo;is effected in a curious manner. On
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>the sixteenth day after the husband&rsquo;s
death, another woman stands behind the widow, who stoops forward, and
unties the t&#257;li in such a way that it falls into a vessel of milk
placed to receive it. Adoption ceremonies are also odd. The
adoptee&rsquo;s feet are washed in turmeric water by the adopter, who
then drinks a little of the liquid. Adoption is accordingly known as
manjan&#299;r kudikkiradu, or the drinking of turmeric water, and the
adopted son as the manjan&#299;r pillai, or turmeric water boy.&rdquo;
Paraiya women do not wear any distinctive dress when they are widows,
and do not shave their heads. But they cease to paint the vermilion
mark (kunkumam) on their foreheads, which married women who are living
with their husbands always wear, except at times when they are
considered ceremonially unclean. The widow of a Paraiyan, if not too
old to bear children, generally lives with another man as his wife.
Sometimes she is ceremonially married to him, and then wears the
t&#257;li. A widow practically chooses her own second husband, and is
not restricted to any particular relative, such as her husband&rsquo;s
elder or younger brother. The practice of the Levirate, by which the
younger brother takes the widow of the elder, is non-existent as a
custom among Paraiyas, though instances of such unions may be found.
Indeed the popular opinion of the Tamil caste credits the Paraiyan with
little regard for any of the restrictions of consanguinity, either
prohibitive or permissive. &ldquo;The palmyra palm has no shadow: the
Paraiyan has no regard for seemliness&rdquo; is a common Tamil
proverb.</p>
<p>It is stated, in the Madras Census Report, 1891, that &ldquo;the
Paraiyans have been but little affected by Br&#257;hmanical doctrines
and customs, though in respect to ceremonies they have not escaped
their influence. Paraiyans are nominally Saivites, but in reality they
are demon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>worshippers.&rdquo; The H&#333;makulam tank in
the South Arcot district is reputed to be the place where Nanda, the
Paraiyan saint, bathed before he performed sacrifice preparatory to his
transfiguration to Br&#257;hmanhood.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1657src" href="#xd21e1657" name="xd21e1657src">60</a>
Br&#257;hman influence has scarcely affected the Paraiyan at all, even
in ceremonial. No Paraiyan may enter any Vaishnava or Saiva temple even
of the humblest sort, though of course his offerings of money are
accepted, if presented by the hands of some friendly S&#363;dra, even
in such exclusive shrines as that of Sr&#299; V&#299;ra R&#257;ghava
Sw&#257;mi at Tiruvall&#363;r. It is true that Paraiyans are often
termed Saivites, but there are many nominal Vaishnavas among them, who
regularly wear the n&#257;mam of Vishnu on their foreheads. The truth
is that the feminine deities, commonly called d&#275;vata, have been
identified by Hindus with the feminine energy of Siva, and thus the
Paraiyans who worship them have received the sectarian epithet. As a
matter of fact, the wearing of the n&#257;mam of Vishnu, or the
smearing of the ashes of Siva, is of no meaning to a Paraiyan. They are
neither Saivites nor Vaishnavites.</p>

</div>
<p>Like all other Dravidians, the Paraiyans acknowledge the existence
of a supreme, omnipresent, personal spiritual Being, the source of all,
whom they call Kadavul (He who is). Kadavul possesses no temples, and
is not worshipped, but he is the highest conception of Paraiya thought.
Paraiyans worship at least three classes of godlings or d&#275;vata,
generally called the mothers (amm&#257;). Sometimes they are worshipped
as the virgins (Kanniyamm&#257;) or the seven virgins. These mothers
may be worshipped collectively in a group. They are then symbolised by
seven stones or bricks, perhaps within a little enclosure, or on a
little platform <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106"
name="pb106">106</a>]</span>in the Paraiya hamlet, or under a margosa
(<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) tree, or sheltered by a wattle hut, or even
by a small brick temple. This temple is universally known as the Amman
Koil. More usually, one particular mother is worshipped at the Paraiya
shrine. She is then called the gr&#257;ma d&#275;vata, or village
goddess, of the particular hamlet. The names of these goddesses are
legion. Each village claims that its own mother is not the same as that
of the next village, but all are supposed to be sisters. Each is
supposed to be the guardian of the boundaries of the ch&#275;ri or
gr&#257;mam where her temple lies, sometimes of both gr&#257;mam and
ch&#275;ri. She is believed to protect its inhabitants and its
livestock from disease, disaster and famine, to promote the fecundity
of cattle and goats, and to give children. In a word, she is called the
benefactress of the place, and of all in it who worship her. The
following are a few of the names of these village tutelary
deities:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Ellamm&#257;, goddess of the boundary, worshipped by
Tamil and Telugu Paraiyans.</p>
<p>M&#363;ngilamm&#257;, bamboo goddess.</p>
<p>Padeiyatt&#257;l or Padeiy&#257;cchi.</p>
<p>Parrapotamm&#257;, a Telugu goddess supposed to cure cattle
diseases.</p>
<p>P&#299;dar&#299;yamm&#257;, sometimes called Ellei Pid&#257;ri.</p>
</div>
<p>The symbol of the goddess may be a conical stone, or a carved idol.
Occasionally a rude figure of the bull Nandi, and an iron trident mark
the shrine. A lamp is often lighted before it at night.</p>
<p>The ceremonial of worship of all classes of d&#275;vata is very
simple. The worshipper prostrates himself before the symbol of the
deity, whether one stone, seven stones, or an image. He anoints it with
oil, smears it with saffron, daubs it with vermilion, garlands it with
flowers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>(<i>Nerium odorum</i> by preference), burns a
bit of camphor, and circumambulates the shrine, keeping his right side
towards it. On special occasions he breaks cocoanuts, kills fowls,
goats or sheep, of which the two last must be killed at one blow, pours
out their blood, perhaps offers a little money, and goes his way,
satisfied that he has done his best to propitiate the d&#275;vata whom
he has honoured.</p>
<p>Special shrines attain very great fame. Thus the goddess
B&#257;vaniyamm&#257;l of Periyap&#257;layam, some sixteen miles from
Madras, is well known, and crowds come to her annual festival.
Paraiyans, Pallis, and Chakkilians form the majority of the
worshippers, but of late years S&#363;dras and even Br&#257;hmans are
to be found at her shrine. The homage rendered to her is twofold. Her
worshippers sacrifice some thousands of sheep on the river bank outside
her temple, and, entirely divesting themselves of their garments, and
covering themselves with bunches of margosa leaves, go round the
temple. Except on the five Sundays, usually in July and August, on
which the festival is held, the shrine is forsaken, and the goddess is
said to be a vegetarian; but on the five festival Sundays she is said
to be as greedy for flesh as a leather-dresser&rsquo;s (Chakkiliyan)
wife.</p>
<p>Two goddesses hold a position distinct from the mothers as a group,
or as tutelary goddesses. These are Gangamm&#257;l and
M&#257;riyatt&#257;l, and their peculiarity is that they are itinerant
deities. Gangamm&#257;l is often described as the goddess of cholera,
and M&#257;riyatt&#257;l, as the goddess of small-pox, though both
diseases are frequently ascribed to the latter. M&#257;riyatt&#257;l is
worshipped under the names of Poleramma and Ammav&#257;ru by Telugus.
For instance, near Arcotkuppam in the North Arcot district, a festival
is held in honour of Gangamm&#257;l in the Tamil month Vaikasi
(May-June), in which S&#363;dras join. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>The main feature of
the festival is the boiling of new rice as at Pongal. Men also put on
women&rsquo;s clothes, and perform grotesque dances. In the same way,
in the ten days&rsquo; festival in honour of M&#257;riyatt&#257;l held
at Uttaramall&#363;r during the Tamil month Avani (August), the goddess
is carried about by washermen (Vann&#257;n), who perform a kind of
pantomime (vilas) in her honour. There is a curious belief that these
goddesses (or Gangamm&#257;l, if they are distinguished) must travel
along roads and paths, and cannot go across country, and that they
cannot pass over the leaves of the margosa or the stems of the plant
called in Tamil perandei (<i>Vitis quadrangularis</i>). Consequently,
when cholera is about, and the goddess is supposed to be travelling
from village to village seeking victims, branches of margosa and long
strings of perandei are placed on all the paths leading into the
gr&#257;mam or ch&#275;ri. Sometimes, also, leaves of the margosa are
strung together, and hung across the village street. These are called
toranam.</p>
<p>Besides the deities already referred to, there are a number of
ghosts, ghouls, and goblins (pey or pis&#257;su), whom Paraiyans
propitiate. Mathureiv&#299;ran and V&#299;rabadran are, for example,
two well-known demons.</p>
<p>Among Tamil Paraiyans there are families in almost every village,
who hold a kind of sacerdotal rank in the esteem of their fellows. They
are called Valluvans, Valluva Pand&#257;rams, or Valluva Paraiyans.
Their position and authority depend largely on their own astuteness.
Sometimes they are respected even by Br&#257;hmans for their powers as
exorcists. It is often impossible to see any difference between the
Valluvans and the ordinary Paraiyans, except that their houses are
usually a little apart from other houses in the ch&#275;ri. They take a
leading part in local Paraiya festivals. At marriages <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>they
pronounce the blessing when the t&#257;li is tied round the
bride&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>In cases of supposed possession by demons, or by the mothers, the
Valluvan is consulted as to the meaning of the portent, and takes part
in driving the spirit out of the victim, sometimes using violence and
blows to compel the spirit to deliver its message and be gone. The
Census Report, 1901, states that Valluvans do not eat or intermarry
with other sections of the Paraiyans. Mr. Clayton is unable to confirm
this, and is inclined to doubt whether it is generally true.</p>
<p>The dead are buried as a rule, but sometimes the corpses are burnt.
A portion of the village waste land is allotted for the purpose. Only
Paraiyans are buried in it. The funeral rites are very simple. The
corpse is carried on a temporary litter of palm leaf mats and bamboos,
wrapped in a cotton cloth, which is a new one if it can be afforded,
and interred or burnt. About the third or fifth day after death, the
p&#257;l sadangu, or milk ceremony, should take place, when some milk
is poured out by the next-of-kin as an offering to the spirit of the
deceased. This spirit is then supposed to assume a sort of corporeity,
and to depart to the place of respite till fate decrees that it be
re-born. This ceremony is accompanied by a family feast. On the
fifteenth day after death, another family gathering is held, and food
is offered to the spirit of the dead person. This ceremony is called
Karum&#257;ntaram, or expiatory ceremony. Occasionally, for some months
after the death, a few flowers are placed on the grave, and a cocoanut
is broken over it; and some attempt is even made to recognise the
anniversary of the date. But there is no regular custom and it is
probably an imitation of Br&#257;hmanical usages. The ordinary
Paraiyan&rsquo;s conception of life after death is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>merely a vague belief that the departed soul
continues its existence somewhere. He has no ordered eschatology. If a
first-born male child dies, it is buried close to or even within the
house, so that its corpse may not be carried off by a witch or
sorcerer, to be used in magic rites, as the body of a first-born child
is supposed to possess special virtues. It is noted by Mr. H. A.
Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1715src" href="#xd21e1715" name=
"xd21e1715src">61</a> that &ldquo;the Tangal&#257;ns profess to have
once been a very respectable class, and wear the sacred thread at
weddings and funerals, while the other divisions never assume
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following note on the death ceremonies of the Paraiyans at
Coimbatore was supplied by Mr. V. Govindan. If the deceased was a
married man, the corpse is placed in a sitting posture in a booth made
of twigs of margosa and milk-hedge (<i>Euphorbia Tirucalli</i>), and
supported behind by a mortar. The widow puts on all her ornaments, and
decorates her hair with flowers. She seats herself on the left side of
the corpse, in the hands of which some paddy (unhusked rice) or salt is
placed. Taking hold of its hands, some one pours the contents thereof
into the hands of the widow, who replaces them in those of the corpse.
This is done thrice, and the widow then ties the rice in her cloth. On
the way to the burial ground (sudukadu), the son carries a new pot, the
barber a pot of cooked rice and brinjal (<i>Solanum Melongena</i>)
fruits and other things required for doing p&#363;ja. The Paraiyan in
charge of the burial ground carries a fire-brand. The mats and other
articles used by the deceased, and the materials of which the booth was
made, are carried in front by the washerman, who deposits them at a
spot between the house of the deceased and the burial ground called the
iduk&#257;du, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111"
name="pb111">111</a>]</span>is made to represent the shrine of
Arichandra. Arichandra was a king, who became a slave of the Paraiyans,
and is in charge of the burial ground. At the iduk&#257;du the corpse
is placed on the ground, and the son, going thrice round it, breaks the
pot of rice near its head. The barber makes a mark at the four corners
of the bier, and the son places a quarter anna on three of the marks,
and some cowdung on the mark at the north-east corner. The widow seats
herself at the feet of the corpse, and another widowed woman breaks her
t&#257;li string, and throws it on the corpse. Arrived at the grave,
the gurukal (priest) descends into it, does p&#363;ja and applies
vibh&#363;ti (sacred ashes) to its sides. The body is lowered into it,
and half a yard of cloth from the winding-sheet is given to the
Paraiyan, and a quarter of a yard to an &#256;ndi (religious
mendicant). The grave is filled in up to the neck of the corpse, and
bael (<i>&AElig;gle Marmelos</i>) leaves, salt, and vibh&#363;ti are
placed on its head by the gurukal. The grave is then filled in, and a
stone and thorny branch placed at the head end. As the son goes,
carrying the water-pot, three times round the grave, the barber makes a
hole in the pot, which is thrown on the stone. The son and other
relations bathe and return to the house, where a vessel containing milk
is set on a mortar, and another containing water placed at the door.
They dip twigs of the p&#299;pal (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>) into the
milk, and throw them on the roof. They also worship a lighted lamp. On
the third day, cooked rice, and other food for which the deceased had a
special liking, are taken to the grave, and placed on plantain leaves.
P&#363;ja is done, and the crows are attracted to the spot. If they do
not turn up, the gurukal prays, and throws up water three times. On the
seventeenth day, the son and others, accompanied by the gurukal, carry
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>a new brick and articles required for p&#363;ja
to the river. The brick is placed under water, and the son bathes. The
articles for p&#363;ja are spread on a plantain leaf, before which the
son places the brick. P&#363;ja is done to it, and a piece of new cloth
tied on it. It is then again carried to the water, and immersed
therein. The ceremonial concludes with the lighting of the sacred fire
(h&#333;mam).</p>
<p>The death ceremonies of the Paraiyan, as carried out in the
Chingleput district, are thus described by Mr. K. Rangachari. The
corpse is washed, dressed, and carried on a bier to the burning or
burial ground. Just before it is placed on the bier, all the relations,
who are under pollution, go round it three times, carrying an iron
measure round which straw has been wrapped, and containing a light. On
the way to the burial ground, the son or grandson scatters paddy, which
has been fried by the agnates. A pot of fire is carried by the
Vettiyan. At a certain spot the bier is placed on the ground, and the
son goes round it, carrying a pot of cooked rice, which he breaks near
the head of the corpse. This rice should not be touched by man or
beast, and it is generally buried. When the corpse has been placed on
the pyre, or laid in the grave, rice is thrown over it by the
relations. The son, carrying a pot of water, goes thrice round it, and
asks those assembled if he may finish the ceremony. On receiving their
assent, he again goes three times round the corpse, and, making three
holes in the pot, throws it down, and goes home without looking back.
If the dead person is unmarried, a mock marriage ceremony, called kanni
kaziththal (removing bachelorhood), is performed before the corpse is
laid on the bier. A garland of arka (<i>Calotropis gigantea</i>)
flowers and leaves is placed round its neck, and balls of mud from a
gutter are laid on the head, knees, and other parts of the body. In
some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>places a variant of the ceremony consists in the
erection of a mimic marriage booth which is covered with leaves of the
arka plant, flowers of which are placed round the neck as a garland. On
the third day after death, cooked rice, milk, fruits, etc., are offered
to the soul of the departed on two leaves placed one near the head, the
other near the feet of the corpse. Of these, the former is taken by
men, and the latter by women, and eaten. The karm&#257;nthiram, or
final ceremony, takes place on the twelfth or sixteenth day. All
concerned in it proceed to a tank with cooked rice, cakes, etc. A
figure of Gan&#275;sa (Pillayar) is made with mud, and five kalasam
(vessels) are placed near it. The various articles which have been
brought are set out in front of it. Two bricks, on which the figures of
a man and woman are drawn, are given to the son, who washes them, and
does p&#363;ja to them after an effigy has been made at the waterside
by a washerman. He then says &ldquo;I gave calves and money. Enter
Kail&#257;sam (the abode of Siva). Find your way to paral&#333;kam (the
other world). I gave you milk and fruit. Go to the world of the dead. I
gave gingelly (<i>Sesamum</i>) and milk. Enter yamal&#333;kam (abode of
the god of death). Eleven descendants on the mother&rsquo;s side and
ten on the father&rsquo;s, twenty-one in all, may they all enter
heaven.&rdquo; He then puts the bricks into the water. On their return
home, the sons of the deceased are presented with new clothes.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e1748width" id="pl6-113"><img src=
"images/pl6-113.jpg" alt="Paraiyans." width="720" height="493">
<p class="figureHead">Paraiyans.</p>
</div>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Tanjore district, that, when
a man dies, camphor is not burnt in the house, but at the junction of
three lanes. Some Paraiyans, on the occurrence of a death in a family,
put a pot filled with dung or water, a broomstick and a fire-brand at
some place where three roads meet, or in front of the house, in order
to prevent the ghost from returning. An impression of the dead
man&rsquo;s palm is taken in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href=
"#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>cow-dung, and stuck on the wall.
In some places, <i>e.g.</i>, at Tirutturaipp&#363;ndi, the Paraiyans
observe a ceremony rather like that observed by Valaiyans and Karaiyans
on the heir&rsquo;s return from the burning-ground on the second day.
Three rice-pounders and a chembu (vessel) of water are placed outside
the door, and the heir sits on these, chews a piece of fish, spits
thrice, and then goes and worships a light burning in the house.</p>
<p>Tattooing is practiced on women and children of both sexes, but not
on grown men. With children it is confined to a simple line drawn down
the forehead. Among Paraiyans who have become Roman Catholics, the
device is sometimes a cross. Women, like those of other Tamil castes,
frequently have their arms elaborately tattooed, and sometimes have a
small pattern between the breasts. A legend runs to the effect that,
many years ago, a Paraiyan woman wished her upper arms and chest to be
tattooed in the form of a bodice. The operation was successfully
carried out till the region of the heart was reached, and then a
vulnerable part was punctured by the needles, with the result that the
woman died. Whence has arisen a superstitious objection to tattooing of
the breasts.</p>
<p>Sometimes an arei-m&#363;di, shaped like the leaf of the
p&#363;varasa tree (<i>Thespesia populnea</i>), made of silver or
silvered brass, is tied round the waist of female infants as an
ornament. Small, flat plates of copper, called takudu, are frequently
worn by children. One side is divided into sixteen squares, in which,
what look like the Telugu numerals nine, ten, eleven and twelve are
engraved. On the other side a circle is drawn, which is divided into
eight segments, in each of which a Telugu letter is inscribed. This
charm is supposed to protect the wearer from harm coming from any of
the eight <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>cardinal points of the Indian compass. Charms,
in the form of metal cylinders, are worn for the same purpose by adults
and children, and procured from some exorcist. Similar or the same
charms are worn to avoid the baneful influence of the evil eye. To
prevent this from affecting their crops, Paraiyans put up scarecrows in
their fields. These are usually small broken earthen pots, whitewashed
or covered with spots of whitewash, or even adorned with huge clay
noses and ears, and made into grotesque faces. They are set up on the
end of poles, to attract the eye of the passer-by from the crop. For
the same reason more elaborate figures, made of mud and twigs, in human
shape, are sometimes set up. Before wells are sunk, a charmer
(mantirakk&#257;ran) is called in to recite spells and find a likely
spot, cocoanuts are broken, and the milk thereof poured out to
propitiate the gods of the place.</p>
<p>The Paraiyans are very largely employed as domestic servants by
Europeans. And it has been said that &ldquo;so necessary to the comfort
of the public is the Paraiya that orthodox Br&#257;hman gentlemen may
be seen employing Paraiya coachmen and syces (footmen). The Christian
Paraiya has become &lsquo;Native Christian&rsquo; caste, and has
achieved, among other things, University honours, the wearing of the
surplice, and the rod of the pedagogue.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1771src" href="#xd21e1771" name="xd21e1771src">62</a> Vast
numbers of Paraiyans are agricultural labourers. Till a score or so of
years ago some were actually bond serfs, and there are instances on
record in quite recent years, which show that it was no infrequent
thing for a Paraiyan to mortgage his son as security for the repayment
of a loan. Some Paraiya families own much land. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. Francis<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1780src" href=
"#xd21e1780" name="xd21e1780src">63</a> that in the South Arcot
district, &ldquo;their numbers, and the comparative wealth which
ground-nut (<i lang="la-x-bio">Arachis hypog&aelig;a</i>) cultivation
has brought them, have caused them to take a rather better social
position here than elsewhere, and they are actually beginning to copy
the social ways of the higher castes, sometimes burning their dead
(though those who have died of cholera or small-pox are still always
buried), marrying their children when infants, and looking with
disfavour on the remarriage of widows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Current Tamil speech and custom divide the landless labouring
Paraiyans into padiy&#257;l and k&#363;liy&#257;l. The padiy&#257;l is
definitely and hereditarily attached to some land-holding family in the
Hindu gr&#257;ma. He can work for no one else, and cannot change
masters. His privilege is that in times of drought and famine his
master must support him. The k&#363;liy&#257;l is a mere day labourer,
only employed, and therefore only receiving pay (k&#363;li) when
required. He has no claim for maintenance in seasons of scarcity, and,
though no man&rsquo;s serf, is worse off than the padiy&#257;l.</p>
<p>Three communal servants, the grave-digger (Vettiy&#257;n), watchman
(Talaiy&#257;ri), and scavenger (T&#333;ti) are all Paraiyans. The
Vettiy&#257;n officiates when a corpse is buried or burned. Hence the
proverb against meddling in what ought to be left to some one
else:&mdash;&ldquo;Let the Vettiy&#257;n and the corpse struggle
together.&rdquo; The Rev. H. Jensen notes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1790src" href="#xd21e1790" name="xd21e1790src">64</a> in
connection with this proverb that &ldquo;when fire is applied to the
pyre at the burning-ground, it sometimes happens that the muscles of
the corpse contract in such a fashion that the body moves, and the
grave-digger has to beat it down into the fire. It looks <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>as
if the two were engaged in a struggle. But no one else should
interfere. The grave-digger knows his own work best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. H. A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1797src"
href="#xd21e1797" name="xd21e1797src">65</a> that &ldquo;among the
lower class of Vell&#257;m Paraiyans, who are the village t&#333;tis,
the following legend is current, accounting for the perquisites which
they get for performing the menial work of the village. When Adi
S&#275;sha was supporting the earth, he became weary, and prayed to
Siva for assistance. Siva ordered a Paraiyan to beat upon his drum, and
cry &lsquo;Let the ripe decay.&rsquo; The Paraiyan enquired what should
be his reward, and was granted the following privileges, viz.,
mank&#363;li (reward for burning corpses), s&#257;n tuni (a span
cloth), v&#257;ykkarisi (the rice in the corpse&rsquo;s mouth), pinda
s&#333;ru (morsel of boiled rice), and s&#363;ttu k&#363;li (fee for
bringing firewood). This seemed to the Paraiya very little, and so, to
increase the death-rate and consequently his perquisites, he cried
&lsquo;Let the ripe and the unripe decay.&rsquo; The sw&#257;mi (god)
remonstrated with him, for the result of his cry was that children and
the middle-aged among men died. The man pleaded poverty, and was given
four additional privileges, viz., a merkal to measure grain, a rod to
measure the ground, a scythe to cut grass, and the privilege of
carrying the karagam-pot when annually running over the village
boundary. All the above privileges still belong to the village vettis,
who receive fees for performing the duties referred to in the
legend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some Paraiyans eat carrion, and Mr. Clayton has known them dig up a
buffalo which had been buried some hours, and eat its flesh. It is said
that even the lowest Paraiyans will not eat the flesh of cows, but
leave <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>that to the leather-dressers (Chakkiliyans). Mr.
Stuart, however, states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1804src" href=
"#xd21e1804" name="xd21e1804src">66</a> that &ldquo;the Konga Paraiyans
and the Vell&#257;m Paraiyans, who do scavenging work, will eat cows
that have died a natural death, while Tangal&#257;ns only eat such as
have been slaughtered.&rdquo; In time of famine, the Paraiyans dig into
ant-hills to rob the ants of their store of grass seed. This is called
pillarisi or grass rice.</p>
<p>There are many proverbs in Tamil, which refer to Paraiyans, from
which the following are selected:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) If a Paraiyan boils rice, will it not reach God? <i>i.e.</i>,
God will notice all piety, even that of a Paraiyan.</li>
<li>(2) When a Paraiya woman eats betel, her ten fingers (will be
daubed with) lime. The Paraiya woman is a proverbial slut.</li>
<li>(3) Though a Paraiya woman&rsquo;s child be put to school, it will
still say Ayy&#275;. Ayy&#275; is vulgar Tamil for Aiyar, meaning
Sir.</li>
<li>(4) The palmyra palm has no shadow; the Paraiyan has no decency. A
contemptuous reference to Paraiya morality.</li>
<li>(5) The gourd flower and the Paraiyan&rsquo;s song have no savour.
Paraiyans use this saying about their own singing.</li>
<li>(6) Though seventy years of age, a Paraiyan will only do what he is
compelled.</li>
<li>(7) You may believe a Paraiyan, even in ten ways; you cannot
believe a Br&#257;hman. Almost the only saying in favour of the
Paraiyan.</li>
<li>(8) Is the sepoy who massacred a thousand horse now living in
disgrace with the dogs of the parach&#275;ri?</li>
<li>(9) Paraiyan&rsquo;s talk is half-talk. A reference to Paraiya
vulgarisms of speech.<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119"
name="pb119">119</a>]</span></li>
<li>(10) Like Paraiya and Br&#257;hman, <i>i.e.</i>, as different as
possible.</li>
<li>(11) Not even a Paraiyan will plough on a full moon day.</li>
<li>(12) Parach&#275;ri manure gives a better yield than any other
manure.</li>
<li>(13) The drum is beaten at weddings, and also at funerals. Said,
according to the Rev. H. Jensen, of a double-dealing unreliable person,
who is as ready for good as for evil.</li>
<li>(14) The harvest of the Paraiya never comes home.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term Paraiya, it may be noted, is applied to the common dog of
Indian towns and villages, and to the scavenger kite, <i>Milvus
Govinda</i>.</p>
<p>The Paraiyans are included by Mr. F. S. Mullaly in his &lsquo;Notes
on Criminal Classes of the Madras Presidency.&rsquo; &ldquo;The local
criminals,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;throughout the Presidency in all
villages are the Paraiyas, and, though they cannot be considered <i>de
facto</i> a criminal tribe, yet a very large proportion of the
criminals of the Presidency are of this caste, notable among them being
the V&#275;p&#363;r Paraiyas of South Arcot.&rdquo; For an account of
these V&#275;pur Paraiyas and their methods I must refer the reader to
Mr. Mullaly&rsquo;s description thereof. Concerning these criminal
Paraiyans, Mr. Francis writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1861src" href="#xd21e1861" name="xd21e1861src">67</a>
&ldquo;There is one branch of them in Suttukulam, a hamlet of
Cuddalore. They are often known as the Tiruttu (thieving) Paraiyans.
The crimes to which they are most addicted are house-breaking and the
theft of cattle, sheep and goats, and the difficulty of bringing them
to book is increased by the organised manner in which they carry on
their depredations. They are, for example, commonly in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>league with the very heads of villages, who
ought to be doing their utmost to secure their arrest, and they have
useful allies in some of the Udaiyans of these parts. It is commonly
declared that their relations are sometimes of a closer nature, and
that the wives of V&#275;pur Paraiyans who are in enforced retirement
are cared for by the Udaiyans. To this is popularly attributed the
undoubted fact that these Paraiyans are often much fairer in complexion
than other members of that caste.&rdquo; It is said to be traditional
among the V&#275;pur Paraiyans that the t&#257;lis (marriage badges) of
Hindu women and lamps should not be stolen from a house, and that
personal violence should not be resorted to, except when unavoidably
necessary for the purpose of escape or self-defence.</p>
<p>In a kindly note on the Paraiya classes, Surgeon-Major W. R. Cornish
sums them up as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1868src" href=
"#xd21e1868" name="xd21e1868src">68</a> &ldquo;A laborious, frugal, and
pleasure-loving people, they are the very life-blood of the country, in
whatever field of labour they engage in. The British administration has
freed them, as a community, from the yoke of hereditary slavery, and
from the legal disabilities under which they suffered; but they still
remain in the lowest depths of social degradation. The Christian
missionaries, to their undying honour be it said, have, as a rule,
persevered in breaking through the time-honoured custom of treating the
Paraiya as dirt, and have admitted him to equal rights and privileges
in their schools and churches, and, whatever may be the present
position of the Paraiya community in regard to education, intelligence,
and ability to hold a place for themselves, they owe it almost wholly
to the Christian men and women who have given up their lives to win
souls for their great Master.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p><b>Paraiyans of Malabar, Cochin and Travancore.&mdash;</b>For the
following note on the Paraiyans or Paraiyas of Cochin I am indebted to
Mr. L. K. Anantha Krishna Aiyar.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1876src"
href="#xd21e1876" name="xd21e1876src">69</a> Paraiyas belong to a very
low caste of the agrestic serfs of Cochin, next to Pulayas in order of
social precedence. They will eat at the hands of all castes, save
Ull&#257;dans, N&#257;y&#257;dis, and Pulayas. But orthodox Pulayas
have to bathe five times, and let blood flow, in order to be purified
from pollution if they touch a Paraiya. In rural parts, a
Paraiya&rsquo;s hut may be seen far away on the hill-side. At the
approach of a member of some higher caste, the inmates run away to the
forest. They cannot walk along the public roads, or in the vicinity of
houses occupied by the higher castes. It is said that they at times
steal the children of N&#257;yars, and hide them in the forest, to
bring them up as their own. They are extremely filthy in person and
habits. They very rarely bathe, or wash their bodies, and a cloth,
purchased at harvest time, is worn till it falls to pieces. They will
eat the flesh of cattle, and are on this account despised even by the
Pulayas. They are their own barbers and washermen.</p>
<p>A legend runs to the effect that Vararuchi, the famous astrologer,
and son of a Br&#257;hman named Chandragupta and his Br&#257;hman wife,
became the King of Avanthi, and ruled till Vikram&#257;ditya, the son
of Chandragupta by his Kshatriya wife, came of age, when he abdicated
in his favour. Once, when he was resting under an ashwastha tree
(<i>Ficus religiosa</i>), invoking the support of the deity living
therein, he overheard the conversation of two Gandarvas on the tree, to
the effect that he would marry a Paraiya girl. This he prevented by
requesting the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>king to have her enclosed in a box, and floated
down a river with a nail stuck into her head. The box was taken
possession of by a Br&#257;hman, who was bathing lower down, and, on
opening it, he found a beautiful girl, whom he considered to be a
divine gift, and regarded as his own daughter. One day the
Br&#257;hman, seeing Vararuchi passing by, invited him to mess with
him, and his invitation was accepted on condition that he would prepare
eighteen curries, and give him what remained after feeding a hundred
Br&#257;hmans. The Br&#257;hman was puzzled, but the maiden, taking a
long leaf, placed thereon a preparation of ginger corresponding to
eighteen curries, and with it some boiled rice used as an offering at
the Vaiswad&#275;va ceremony, as the equivalent of the food for
Br&#257;hmans. Knowing this to be the work of the maiden, Vararuchi
desired to marry her, and his wish was acceded to by the Br&#257;hman.
One day, while conversing with his wife about their past lives, he
chanced to see a nail stuck in her head, and he knew her to be the girl
whom he had caused to be floated down the stream. He accordingly
resolved to go on a pilgrimage with his wife, bathing in rivers, and
worshipping at temples. At last they came to K&#275;rala, where the
woman bore him twelve sons, all of whom, except one, were taken care of
by members of different castes. They were all remarkable for their
wisdom, and believed to be the avatar (incarnation) of Vishnu, gifted
with the power of performing miracles. One of them was Pakkanar, the
great Malay&#257;lam bard. Once, it is said, when some Br&#257;hmans
resolved to go to Benares, Pakkanar tried to dissuade them from so
doing by telling them that the journey to the sacred city would not be
productive of salvation. To prove the fruitlessness of their journey,
he plucked a lotus flower from a stagnant pool, and gave <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>it
to them with instructions to deliver it to a hand which would rise from
the Ganges, when they were to say that it was a present for the goddess
Ganga from Pakkanar. They did as directed, and returned with news of
the miracle. Pakkanar then led them to the stagnant pool, and said
&ldquo;Please return the lotus flower, Oh! Ganga,&rdquo; when it
appeared in his hand. Pakkanar is said to have earned his living by the
sale of the wicker-work, which he made. One day he could not sell his
baskets, and he had to go starving. A neighbour, however, gave him some
milk, which Pakkanar accepted, and told the donor to think of him if
ever he was in danger. The neighbour had a married daughter living with
him, who, some time after, was dying of snake-bite. But her father
remembered the words of Pakkanar, who came to the rescue, and cured
her. One of Pakkanar&rsquo;s brothers was named Narayana Branthan, who
pretended to be a lunatic, and whose special delight was in rolling
huge stones up a hill, for the pleasure of seeing them roll down.
Though the son of a Br&#257;hman, he mixed freely with members of all
castes, and had no scruple about dining with them. A Namb&#363;tiri
Br&#257;hman once asked him to choose an auspicious day for the
performance of his son&rsquo;s upanayanam (thread ceremony). He
selected a most inauspicious day and hour, when the boy&rsquo;s family
assembled and asked Narayana whether the rite should be celebrated. He
told the father to look at the sky, which became brilliantly
illuminated, and a Br&#257;hman was seen changing his sacred thread.
The omen being considered favourable, the investiture ceremony was
proceeded with.</p>
<p>The Paraiyas of Malabar and Cochin are celebrated for their
knowledge of black magic, and are consulted in matters relating to
theft, demoniacal influence, and the killing of enemies. Whenever
anything is stolen, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href=
"#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>Paraiya magician is consulted.
Giving hopes of the recovery of the stolen article, he receives from
his client some paddy (rice) and a few panams (money), with which he
purchases plantain fruits, a cocoanut or two, toddy, camphor,
frankincense, and rice flour. After bathing, he offers these to his
favourite deity Parakutti, who is represented by a stone placed in
front of his hut. Rattling an iron instrument, and singing till his
voice almost fails, he invokes the god. If the lost property does not
turn up, he resorts to a more indignant and abusive form of invocation.
If the thief has to be caught, his prayers are redoubled, and he
becomes possessed, and blood passes out of his nose and mouth. When a
person is ill, or under the influence of a demon, an astrologer and a
magician named by the former are consulted. The magician, taking a
cadjan (palm) leaf or copper or silver sheet, draws thereon cabalistic
figures, and utters a mantram (prayer). Rolling up the leaf or sheet,
he ties it to a thread, and it is worn round the neck in the case of a
woman, and round the loins in the case of a man. Sometimes the
magician, taking a thread, makes several knots in it, while reciting a
mantram. The thread is worn round the neck or wrist. Or ashes are
thrown over a sick person, and rubbed over the forehead and breast,
while a mantram is repeated. Of mantrams, the following may be cited as
examples. &ldquo;Salutation to god with a thousand locks of matted
hair, a thousand hands filling the three worlds and overflowing the
same. Oh! Goddess mother, out of the supreme soul, descend. Oh! Sundara
Yaksha (handsome she-devil), Swaha (an efficacious word).&rdquo;
&ldquo;Salutation to god. He bears a lion on his head, or is in the
form of a lion in the upper part of his body. In the mooladhara sits
Garuda, the lord of birds, enemy of serpents, and v&#257;hana (vehicle)
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>Vishnu. He has Lakshmana to the left, R&#257;ma
to the right, Hanum&#257;n in front, R&#257;vana behind, and all
around, above, below, everywhere he has Sr&#299; Narayana Swaha. Mayst
thou watch over or protect me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Paraiyans are notorious for the performance of marana kriyakal,
or ceremonies for the killing of enemies. They resort to various
methods, of which the following are examples:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Make an image in wax in the form of your enemy. Take it in your
right hand, and your chain of beads in your left hand. Then burn the
image with due rites, and it shall slay your enemy in a fortnight.</p>
<p>(2) Take a human bone from a burial-ground, and recite over it a
thousand times the following mantra:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, swine-faced
goddess! seize him, seize him as a victim. Drink his blood; eat, eat
his flesh. Oh, image of imminent death! Malayala Bhagavathi.&rdquo; The
bone, thrown into the enemy&rsquo;s house, will cause his ruin.</p>
<p>Odi or oti cult (breaking the human body) is the name given to a
form of black magic practiced by the Paraiyans, who, when proficient in
it, are believed to be able to render themselves invisible, or assume
the form of a bull, cat, or dog. They are supposed to be able to entice
pregnant women from their houses at dead of night, to destroy the
f&oelig;tus in the womb, and substitute other substances for it; to
bring sickness and death upon people; and so to bewitch people as to
transport them from one place to another. A Paraiya who wishes to
practice the cult goes to a guru (preceptor), and, falling at his feet,
humbly requests that he may be admitted into the mysteries of the art.
The master first tries to dissuade him, but the disciple persists in
the desire to learn it. He is then tried by various tests as to his
fitness. He follows his master to the forests <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>and
lonely places at midnight. The master suddenly makes himself invisible,
and soon appears before him in the form of a terrible bull, a ferocious
dog, or an elephant, when the novice should remain calm and collected.
He is also required to pass a night or two in the forest, which,
according to his firm belief, is full of strange beings howling
horribly. He should remain unmoved. By these and other trials, he is
tested as to his fitness. Having passed through the various ordeals,
the guru initiates him into the brotherhood by the performance of
p&#363;ja on an auspicious day to his favourite N&#299;li, called also
Kallatikode N&#299;li, through whose aid he works his black art. Flesh
and liquor are consumed, and the disciple is taught how to prepare
pilla thilam and angola thilam, which are the potent medicines for the
working of his cult. The chief ingredient in the preparation of pilla
thilam, or baby oil, is the sixth or seventh month&rsquo;s f&oelig;tus
of a primipara, who should belong to a caste other than that of the
sorcerer. Having satisfied himself that the omens are favourable, he
sets out at midnight for the house of the woman selected as his victim,
and walks several times round it, waving a cocoanut shell containing a
mixture of lime and turmeric water (gurusi), and muttering mantrams to
secure the aid of the deity. He also draws yantrams (cabalistic
devices) on the ground. The woman is compelled to come out of her
house. Even if the door is locked, she will bang her head against it,
and force it open. The sorcerer leads her to a retired spot, strips her
naked, and tells her to lie flat on the ground. This she does, and a
vessel made of a gourd (<i>Lagenaria</i>) is placed close to her
vagina. The uterus then contracts, and the f&oelig;tus emerges.
Sometimes, it is said, the uterus is filled with some rubbish, and the
woman instantly dies. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href=
"#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>Care is taken that the f&oelig;tus
does not touch the ground, as the potency of the drug would thereby be
ruined. The f&oelig;tus is cut to pieces, and smoked over a fire. It is
then placed in a vessel provided with a few holes, below which is
another vessel. The two are placed in a larger receptacle filled with
water, which is heated over a fire. From the f&oelig;tus a liquid
exudes, which is collected in the lower vessel. A human skull is then
reduced to a fine powder, which is mixed with a portion of the liquid
(thilam). With the mixture a mark is made on the forehead of the
sorcerer, who rubs some of it over various parts of his body, and
drinks a small quantity of cow-dung water. He then thinks that he can
assume the form of any animal he likes, and achieve his object in view,
be it murder or bodily injury. The magic oil, called angola thilam, is
extracted from the angola tree (<i>Alangium Lamarckii</i>), which bears
a very large number of fruits. One of these is believed to be endowed
with life and power of motion, and to be capable of descending and
returning to its original position on dark nights. Its possession can
be attained by demons, or by an expert watching at the foot of the
tree. When it has been secured, the extraction of the oil involves the
same operations as those for extracting the pilla thilam, and they must
be carried out within seven hours. A mark made on the forehead with the
oil enables its wearer to achieve his desires, and to transform himself
into some animal.</p>
<p>When a person has an enemy whom he wishes to get rid of, the Paraiya
magician is consulted, and the name of the enemy given to him.
Identifying his residence, the Paraiya starts off on a dark night, and
anyone whom he comes across is at once dispatched with a blow. The
victim comes out of his house in a state of stupefaction, and the
magician puts him to death either by a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>blow on the head, or
by suffocating him with two sticks applied to his neck. Odi cult is
said to have been practiced till only a few years ago in the rural
parts of the northern part of the State, and in the t&#257;luks of
Palgh&#257;t and Walluvan&#257;d in Malabar, and even now it has not
entirely died out. But cases of extracting f&oelig;tuses and putting
persons to death are not heard of at the present day, owing to the fear
of Government officials, landlords, and others. The story is current of
a N&#257;yar village official, who had two fine bullocks, which a
M&#257;ppila wished to purchase. The N&#257;yar, however, was unwilling
to part with them. The M&#257;ppila accordingly engaged some men to
steal the animals. Availing themselves of the absence of the N&#257;yar
from home, the robbers went to his house, where they saw a Paraiya and
his wife practicing the odi cult, and compelling a young woman to come
out of the house, and lie on the ground. Catching hold of the Paraiya,
the robbers tied him to a tree, and secured him. The man and his wife
were beaten, and the would-be robbers rewarded with a present of the
bullocks.</p>
<p>The Paraiyans have no temples of their own, but worship Siva or
K&#257;li. According to a legend, in Tretay&#363;ga (the second age), a
Paraiya named Samvara, and his wife Pulini were living in a forest, and
one day came across a Sivalinga (stone lingam) at a dilapidated temple,
which they kept, and worshipped with offerings of flesh, and by
smearing it with ashes from the burial-ground. On a certain day, no
ashes were available, and the woman offered to have her body burnt, so
that the ashes thereof might be used. With much reluctance her husband
sacrificed her, and performed p&#363;ja. Then he turned round to offer,
as usual, the prasadam to his wife forgetting that she was dead, and he
was surprised to see her standing before him, receiving his offering
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>(prasadam), in flesh and blood. Highly pleased
with their conduct, Siva appeared in person before them, and gave them
absolution.</p>
<p>In every small village in the rural parts, is a small Bhagavati
temple, to the deity of which the Paraiyas are devotedly attached, and
look to it for protection in times of cholera, small-pox, or other
calamities. <span class="corr" id="xd21e1923" title=
"Source: Kodungal&#363;r">Kodungall&#363;r</span> Bhagavati is their
guardian deity, and they take part in the festivals (y&#275;la) at the
shrine. A few days before the festival, a piece of cloth is given to
the Velichap&#257;d (oracle), who dresses himself in it, wears a piece
of red cloth round his neck, a peculiar dress around his loins, and
ties a few small bells (chelamba) round his legs. Accompanied by others
with drums and fife and a basket, he goes to every N&#257;yar house
daily for seven days, and receives presents of paddy, wherewith to
defray the expenses of the festival. During the celebration thereof,
the Velichap&#257;d and others go to a shed at a distance from the
temple (kavu), some dressed up as ghosts, and dance and sing, to the
accompaniment of a band, in honour of the deity.</p>
<p>In a note on the Paraiyans of Malabar, Mr. T. K. Gopaul Panikkar
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1928src" href="#xd21e1928" name=
"xd21e1928src">70</a> that &ldquo;at certain periods of the year the
Paraiyas have to assume the garb of an evil deity, with large
head-dresses and paintings on the body and face, and tender cocoanut
leaves hanging loose around their waists, all these embellishments
being of the rudest patterns. With figures such as these,
terror-striking in themselves, dancing with tom-toms sounding and horns
blowing, representing the various temple deities, they visit the Nair
houses, professing thereby to drive off any evil deities that may be
haunting their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>neighbourhood. After their dues have been given
to them, they go their ways; and, on the last day, after finishing
their house-to-house visits, they collect near their special temples to
take part in the v&#275;la tam&#257;sha (spectacle).&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the first of every month, a ceremony called kalasam is performed
on behalf of the spirits of the departed. Fish, cooked meat, rice,
parched grain, plantain fruits, cocoanuts, toddy, and other things, are
placed on a leaf with a lighted lamp in front of it. A prayer is then
uttered, expressing a hope that the ancestors will partake of the food
which has been procured for them with much difficulty, and protect the
living. One man, becoming inspired, acts the part of an oracle, and
addresses those assembled.</p>
<p>The following story is narrated concerning the origin of the
Elankunnapuzha temple on the island of Vyp&#299;n. When some Paraiyas
were cutting reeds, one of them discovered a remarkable idol and fell
into a trance, under the influence of which he informed the R&#257;ja
of Cochin that the idol originally belonged to the Trichendur temple in
Tinnevelly, and that he must build a shrine for it. This was
accordingly done, and to the Paraiyan who discovered the idol a daily
allowance of rice, and a larger quantity of rice during the annual
temple festival were given. In return, he had to supply cadjan (palm
leaf) umbrellas used at the daily procession, and bamboo baskets
required for washing the rice offered to the idol. These allowances
were received by the Perum or big Paraiyan up to a recent date, even if
he is not receiving them at the present day.</p>
<p>When a Paraiyan woman is delivered, she is secluded for two weeks in
a temporary hut erected at a short distance from the dwelling hut. On
the tenth day, some male <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href=
"#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>member of the family goes to his
Br&#257;hman or N&#257;yar landlord, from whom he receives some milk,
which is sprinkled over the woman and her infant. She can then come to
the verandah of her home, and remains there for five days, when she is
purified by bathing. The temporary hut is burnt down.</p>
<p>The dead are buried, and the corpse, after being laid in the grave,
is covered with a mat.</p>
<p>The Paraiyas are engaged in the manufacture of wicker baskets,
bamboo mats, and cadjan umbrellas. They also take part in all kinds of
agricultural work, and, when ploughing, will not use buffaloes, which
are regarded as unclean beasts, the touch of which necessitates a
ceremonial ablution.</p>
<p>Many Paraiyans become converts to Christianity, and thereby receive
a rise in the social scale, and a freedom from the disabilities under
which their lowly position in the social scale places them.</p>
<p>In 1829 several natives of Malabar were charged with having
proceeded, in company with a Paraiyan, to the house of a pregnant
woman, who was beaten and otherwise ill-treated, and with having taken
the f&oelig;tus out of her uterus, and introduced in lieu thereof the
skin of a calf and an earthen pot. The prisoners confessed before the
police, but were acquitted, mainly on the ground that the earthen pot
was of a size which rendered it impossible to credit its introduction
during life.</p>
<p>In 1834 the inhabitants of several villages in Malabar attacked a
village of Paraiyans on the alleged ground that deaths of people and
cattle, and the protracted labour of a woman in childbed, had been
caused by the practice of sorcery by the Paraiyans. They were beaten
inhumanely, with their hands tied behind their backs, so that several
died. The villagers were driven, bound, into <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>a
river, immersed under water so as nearly to produce suffocation, and
their own children were forced to rub sand into their wounds. Their
settlement was then razed to the ground and they were driven into
banishment.</p>
<p>The following extract is taken from a note on the Paraiyans of
Travancore by Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar. The Paraiyas may be broadly
divided into two classes, viz., the Tamil-speaking Paraiyas of the east
coast who are found in considerable numbers in the southern
t&#257;luks, and the indigenous Paraiyas, who mostly abound in Central
Travancore, avoiding the sea-coast t&#257;luks. The latter only are
considered here. The titles owned by some are V&#275;lan conferred upon
certain families for their skill in magic; Panikkan; and M&#363;ppan.
The Paraiyas may be mainly divided into four divisions, viz., Vellam
(water or jaggery?), V&#275;l (a lance), Natuvile (middle), and Pani
(work). The last is considered to be the lowest in the social scale,
and members thereof are not admitted into the houses of the other
divisions. One theory of the origin of the Paraiyas is that they were
formerly one with the Pulayas, from whom they separated on account of
their eating beef. The Paraiyas have a dialect of their own, with which
the Pulayas are not familiar, and which would seem to be worthy of
study. In the K&#275;ralolpathi, they are classed as one of the sixteen
hill tribes. Concerning their origin the following tradition is
current. They were originally Br&#257;hmans, but, on certain
coparceners partitioning the common inheritance, the carcase of a cow,
which was one of the articles to be partitioned, was burnt as being
useless. A drop of oil fell from the burning animal on to one of the
parties, and he licked it up with his tongue. For this act he was cast
out of society, and his descendants, under the name of Paraiyas, became
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>cow-eaters. Pakkanar is said to have been born a
Paraiyan, though subsequent tradition honours him with Br&#257;hmanical
parentage.</p>
<p>The houses of the Paraiyas are, like those of the Pulayas, mean
thatched sheds, with a couple of cocoanut leaves often serving as the
wall between one room and another. The village sites are shifted from
place to place, according to the exigencies of the inhabitants thereof.
The Paraiyas imbibe freely, and toddy is the drink most scrupulously
prescribed for those who are under a vow. Like the Pulayas, the
Paraiyas work in the rice fields and cocoanut gardens, and are employed
in hill cultivation, and the manufacture of wicker baskets. The sun god
is their principal deity, and in his name all solemn oaths are uttered.
It is believed that the Br&#257;hman who originally became a Paraiya
cursed Brahma. To remove the evil effects of the curse, the sun gave to
his descendants as objects of worship forty-eight thousand gods and
eight special deities. A certain portion of the house is regarded as
their own, and to them offerings of beaten rice and toddy are made on
the first of every month, and, if convenient, every Tuesday and Friday.
To these deities small shrines are dedicated, whereat the priests, on
the 28th of Makaram (January-February), become inspired, and answer
questions concerning the future put to them by the assembled Paraiyas.
The priests are known as Kaikk&#257;rans, and belong ordinarily to the
lowest or Pani division.</p>
<p>Adultery, be it said to the credit of the Paraiyas, is an offence
which is severely punished. The man is fined, and the erring woman has
to jump over a fire which is blazing in a deep pit. This ordeal recalls
to mind the smarthavicharam of the Namb&#363;ri Br&#257;hman.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p>Pollution, on the occurrence of the first monthly period, lasts for
seven days. The headmen and elders, called Jajamanmar and Karanavanmar,
are invited to attend, and direct four women of the village to take the
girl to a hut erected at a considerable distance from the house. This
hut is called pachchakottilil kutiyiruttuka, or seating a person within
a hut made of green leaves. On the fourth day the girl has a bath, and
the Kaikk&#257;ran waves paddy and flowers in front of her. On the
morning of the eighth day the shed is burnt down, and the place
occupied by it cleansed with water and cow-dung. The girl bathes, and
is thus rendered free from pollution. A woman, during her menses,
should remain at a distance of sixty-four feet from others.</p>
<p>The Paraiyas observe two marriage rites, the t&#257;li-kettu and
sambandham. The former ceremony must be performed before the girl
reaches puberty, and the t&#257;li-tier is her maternal uncle&rsquo;s
or paternal aunt&rsquo;s son. The Kaikk&#257;ran invites at least four
headmen to be present, and they prescribe the manner in which the
ceremony is to be performed. The auspicious time for the marriage
celebration is fixed by a Kaniyan (astrologer), and, on the day before
the wedding, the Kaikk&#257;ran invites the Paraiyas of the village to
be present at the tunniruttal, or erection of the pandal (booth). All
those who attend are presented with betel, tobacco, and a liberal
allowance of toddy. The next item in the programme is the
vachchorukkal, or placing beaten and cooked rice, flowers, toddy, and
other things in the pandal, under the direction of the Kaikk&#257;ran.
Some of the assembled males then sing a song called maranpattu, or song
of the god of love. The bride then becomes inspired, and dances, while
the sorcerer rolls out mystic hymns. On the following morning, the
bridegroom goes to the home of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135"
href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>the bride in procession, and
is led to a wooden seat in the centre of the pandal, where he is joined
by the bride, who seats herself on his left. He then ties the minnu
(marriage badge) round her neck, and retires with her to the maniyara,
or bedroom, where they remain together for some minutes. On the final
day of the ceremonies, the bride is bathed.</p>
<p>When a Kaikk&#257;ran dies, a conch shell is buried with the corpse.
Once a year, and on some new moon day, offerings are made to all the
deceased ancestors.</p>
<p>The Paraiyas have a dramatic entertainment called Paraiyan Kali, in
which the performer plays his part, standing on a mortar, to the
accompaniment of music.</p>
<p>Paraiyas are required to keep at a distance of 128 feet from
Br&#257;hmans, <i>i.e.</i>, double the distance required of a Pulaya.
But they will not receive food at the hands of the Pulayas.</p>
<p>In a further note on the &ldquo;Paraiya Caste in Travancore,&rdquo;
the Rev. S. Mateer writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1981src" href="#xd21e1981" name="xd21e1981src">71</a> &ldquo;They
were formerly bought and sold like cattle, starved, flogged &lsquo;like
buffaloes,&rsquo; made to work all day for a little rice, and kept at a
distance as polluted; and they still are in a position of subservience
and deep degradation, not vitally differing from that of the Pulayas
and V&#275;dars. One particular characteristic of this caste, and most
offensive to others, is that they eat the flesh of bullocks and cows
left dead by the roadside. They cut it up, and bear it away; what they
leave the vultures and dogs devour. This disgusting practice is to a
great extent disappearing among the Christian castes. The Paraiyas of
Nevandrum (Trivandrum?) district live in clusters of huts, and eat the
putrid flesh of dead cattle, tigers, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>other animals. Their
girls are &lsquo;married&rsquo; when very young for mere form to their
cousins, but, when grown up, are selected by others, who give them a
cloth, and live with them in concubinage. Cases of polygamy occur, and
sometimes also of polyandry. They eat the seed of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Ochlandra Rheedii</i>, which abounds in an unusually dry
season, as does also the bamboo. Jungle roots, land crabs, and snails
form part of their food. Some of them have enough of rice at harvest
time, but seldom at any other period of the year. They are zealous
devil worshippers, their chief demons being M&#257;dan (the cow one),
Rathach&#257;mandy Mallan (the giant) and M&#363;varatta Mallan,
Karunk&#257;li (black k&#257;li), Ch&#257;vus (departed spirits),
Bh&#363;tham, Mantram&#363;rtti, and other Murttis (ghosts), with many
other evil beings, to whom groves and altars are dedicated. The souls
of their deceased ancestors are called Marutt&#257; (ghosts), for whose
worship young cocoanut leaves are tied at the bottom of a tree, and a
small shed is erected on poles, and decorated with garlands of flowers.
Presents of cocoanuts, parched rice, and arrack are offered, and cocks
killed in sacrifice. In the devil-dancing they use clubs and rattans,
bells, handkerchiefs, and cloths dedicated to their deities. Other
castes generally dread incurring the displeasure and malice of these
deities. S&#363;dras and Sh&#257;nars frequently employ the Paraiya
devil-dancers and sorcerers to exorcise demons, search for and dig out
magical charms buried in the earth by enemies, and counteract their
enchantments; and, in cases of sickness, send for them to beat the
drum, and so discover what demon has caused the affliction, and what is
to be done to remove it. Sometimes a present of a cow is given for
those services. These pretended sorcerers are slightly acquainted with
a few medicines, profess to cure snake-bite, and can <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>repeat some tales of the Hindu gods. They also
profess to discover thieves, who sometimes indeed through fear actually
take ill, confess, and restore the property. One priest whom I knew
used to pretend that he had a &lsquo;bird devil&rsquo; in his
possession, by which he could cast out other devils. On one occasion,
however, when he made the attempt in the presence of a large concourse
of S&#363;dras and others, he utterly failed, and hurt himself severely
by beating his chest with a cocoanut and leaping into the fire. He soon
after resolved to abandon this course of life, and became a
Christian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the wife&rsquo;s confinement, the husband is starved
for seven days, eating no cooked rice or other food, only roots and
fruits, and drinking only arrack or toddy. The shed, in which she was
confined, is burnt down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In cases of sickness, the diviner is first consulted as to
its cause. He names a demon, and offerings are demanded of rice,
fruits, flowers, and fowls. Being daily supplied with these articles,
the diviner spreads cow-dung thinly over a small space in the yard,
where he places the offerings on three plantain leaves, invokes the
presence of the demons, dances and repeats mantras, looking towards the
east. He catches the demon that is supposed to come in an old piece of
cloth filled with flowers and parched rice, and carries both demon and
offerings into the jungle, where, again preparing a spot as before, two
torches are set, the food arranged, and, after further mantras, a fowl
is sacrificed. He takes the whole afterwards for himself, gets a good
meal, and is also paid twelve chuckrams (small silver coins) for the
service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In cases of small-pox, one who has had this disease is called
in to attend. He takes the patient to a temporary hut in a lonely
place, and is well paid, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href=
"#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>supplied with all that he
requires. Through fear, none of the relatives will go near. Should the
patient die, the attendant buries him on the spot, performing the
ceremonies himself, then comes to the house, repeats mantras, and waves
his hands round the head of each to remove further alarm. If a woman
with child dies, she is buried at a great distance away. Occasionally
the remains of an aged man are burnt on a funeral pile, as being more
honourable than burial, and providing some merit to the soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us pay a visit to one of the rural hamlets of the
K&#333;l&#257;m Paraiyans, a considerable sub-division of this caste.
The cattle manure is saved, but handed over to the S&#363;dra farmers.
The Paraiyas plant a few trees around their settlement as otti
(mortgage) and kurik&#257;nam (a kind of tenant right), then pay a sum
to the S&#363;dra landowner to permit them to enjoy the produce, as it
is so difficult for them to get waste lands registered in their own
name. Some have cleared lands, and possess a few cocoanut and betel-nut
palms, mangoes, etc. They may have a few cattle also, and let out a
milch cow to the shepherds at one rupee per month. They grow some
vegetables, etc., in waste valley lands temporarily cleared and
cultivated. They work in the rice fields, sowing, planting, and
reaping, for which they are paid in paddy. During the slack season they
work at making mats of <i>Ochlandra Rheedii</i>, for which the men
bring loads of the reeds from the hills, and the women do the work of
plaiting. This art they are said to have learnt from the Kanikar
hill-men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some Paraiyas in Nanjin&#257;d have enjoyed ancestral
property for six generations, and a few still have good properties.
Titles were purchased for money of the R&#257;jas of Travancore,
<i>e.g.</i>, S&#257;mbavan, an old name for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>P&#257;ndi Paraiyas. The R&#257;ja gave to such
a headman a cane, and authority to claim a double allowance of betel,
etc. He, however, had in his turn to give double at funerals and
festivals to his visitors. This head Paraiyan would be met with drums
and marks of honour by his people, and the arrangement would enable the
Government to rule the Paraiyas more easily. It is said that some
R&#257;ja, fleeing in war, hid himself in Paraiya huts at Changankadei,
and was thereby saved, for which he gave them a small grant of land
producing a few fanams annually, which they still enjoy. They have a
tradition that, in M.E. 102 (A.D. 927), one Vanji Mannan R&#257;ja
granted privileges to Paraiyas. During the war with Tippu, proclamation
was made that every Paraiyan in this district must have a N&#257;yar or
master, and belong to some one or other. All who were not private
property would be made slaves of the Sirkar (Government), which was
greatly dreaded on account of the merciless oppression, and obliged to
cut grass for the troops, and do other services. Many, therefore,
became nominally slaves to some respectable man, asking it as a
kindness to free them from Government slavery. Several respectable
families begged the Namb&#363;ri high priest, visiting Suchindram and
other temples, to call them his slaves, for which they paid him one
fanam a head per annum. This payment is still kept up. This priest
conferred upon them additional benefits, for in their troubles and
oppressions, he wrote to the Government, requiring from them justice
and proper treatment. The slaves of the Namb&#363;ri would also be
treated with consideration on account of his sacred position and rank.
These families, &lsquo;Potty slaves,&rsquo; still intermarry only among
themselves, as in this case the wife could not be claimed by a
different owner from the husband&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lastly, as to the Paraiyas of North Travancore. Their
condition seems lowest of all, as they enter further into the
Malay&#257;lam country, and enjoy fewer opportunities of escape from
caste degradation and from bitter servitude. &lsquo;Their own
tradition,&rsquo; the Rev. G. Matthan writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2020src" href="#xd21e2020" name="xd21e2020src">72</a> &lsquo;has
it that they were a division of the Br&#257;hmans, who were entrapped
into a breach of caste by their enemies, through making them eat beef.
They eat carrion and other loathsome things. The carcases of all
domestic animals are claimed by them as belonging to them by right.
They frequently poison cows, and otherwise kill them for the sake of
their flesh. They are also charged with kidnapping women of the higher
castes, whom they are said to treat in the most brutal manner. It is
their custom to turn robbers in the month of February, in which month
they pretend the wrong was done them, to break into the houses of the
Br&#257;hmans and Nairs, and to carry away their women, children, and
property, to which they are actuated more by motives of revenge than of
interest, and to justify which they plead the injury their caste had
received from these parties. In former times, they appear to have been
able to perpetrate these cruelties almost with impunity, from the fear
of which the people still betray great uneasiness, though the custom
has now grown into disuse.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>P&#257;rasaivan.&mdash;</b>A title of &#332;cchans, who are
Saivites, and priests at temples of Gr&#257;ma D&#275;vatas (village
deities). In the Malay&#257;lam country P&#257;ras&#257;va occurs as a
title of Variyar, a section of Ambalav&#257;si. The word indicates the
son of a Br&#257;hman by a S&#363;dra woman.</p>
<p><b>Parava.&mdash;</b>The Tulu-speaking Paravas of South Canara are,
like the Nalkes and Pombadas, devil-dancers, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>and
are further employed in the manufacture of baskets and umbrellas.
Socially, they occupy a higher position than the Nalkes, but rank below
the Pombadas. The bh&#363;thas (devils) whose disguise they assume are
Kodamanitaya and the Baiderukalu, who may not be represented by Nalkes;
and they have no objection to putting on the disguise of other
bh&#363;thas. Paravas are engaged for all kinds of devil-dances when
Nalkes are not available. (<i>See</i> Nalke.)</p>

</div>
<p><b>Paravan.&mdash;</b>Concerning the origin of the Parava fishing
community of the south-east coast, the following legends are
current.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2045src" href="#xd21e2045" name=
"xd21e2045src">73</a> The author of the Historia Ecclesiastica
(published in Tamil at Tranquebar in 1735) identifies them with the
Parvaim of the Scriptures, and adds that, in the time of Solomon, they
were famous among those who made voyages by sea; but it does not appear
that there is any solid foundation for this hypothesis. It is the
general belief among the Paravas that their original country was
Ayodhya, or Oudh; and it appears that, previously to the war of
Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, they inhabited the territory bordering on the
river Yamuna or Jumna. At present they are chiefly found in the seaport
towns of the Tinnevelly district in the south of India, and also in
some of the provinces on the north-west coast of Ceylon. With regard to
their origin, there is a variety as well as discordancy of opinions.
Some of the Tantras represent them to be descended from a Br&#257;hman
by a S&#363;dra woman, while the J&#257;t&#299;b&#275;di N&#363;l (a
work of some celebrity among the Tamils) states them to be the
offspring of a Kurava (or basket-maker) begotten clandestinely on a
female of the Chetty (or merchant) tribe. But the Paravas have among
themselves quite a different <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href=
"#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>tradition concerning their origin,
which is founded on mythological fable. They relate that their
progenitors were of the race Varuna (god of the sea), and on the
occasion, when Siva had called Kartik&#275;ya (god of arms) into
existence, for destroying the overwhelming power of the Asuras (evil
spirits), they sprang up with him from the sacred lake Sarawana, and
were like him nursed by the constellation Kartika. At the close of the
last kalpa, when the whole earth was covered with a deluge, they
constructed a dh&#333;ni or boat, and by it escaped the general
destruction; and, when dry land appeared, they settled on the spot
where the dh&#333;ni rested; hence it is called Dh&#333;nipura, or the
city of the boat. The Paravas were once a very powerful people, and no
doubt derived much of their ascendancy over other tribes from their
knowledge of navigation. They had a succession of kings among them,
distinguished by the title of Ad&#299;yar&#257;sen, some of whom seem
to have resided at Uttara K&#333;samangay, called at that time the city
of Mangay, a famous place of Hindu pilgrimage in the neighbourhood of
R&#257;mn&#257;d. In the Pur&#257;na entitled Val&#275;v&#299;s&#363;
Pur&#257;nam we meet with the following fable. Parvati, the consort of
Siva, and her son Kartik&#275;ya, having offended the deity by
revealing some ineffable mystery, were condemned to quit their
celestial mansions, and pass through an infinite number of mortal
forms, before they could be re-admitted to the divine presence. On the
entreaty of Parvati, however, they were allowed, as a mitigation of the
punishment, each to undergo but one transmigration. And, as about this
time, Triambaka, King of the Paravas, and Varuna Valli his consort were
making tapas (acts of devotion) to obtain issue, Parvati condescended
to be incarnated as their daughter under the name of T&#299;rys&#275;r
Madent&#275;. Her son Kartik&#275;ya, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>transforming himself
into a fish, was roaming for some time in the north sea. It appears,
however, that he left the north, and made his way into the south sea,
where, growing to an immense size, he attacked the vessels employed by
the Paravas in their fisheries, and threatened to destroy their trade.
Whereupon the King Triambaka made a public declaration that whoever
would catch the fish should have his daughter to wife. Siva, now
assuming the character of a Parava, caught the fish, and became
re-united to his consort. In that section of the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata
entitled &#256;diparva it is said that the King of the Paravas, who
resided on the banks of the Jumna, having found an infant girl in the
belly of a fish, adopted her as his own daughter, giving her the name
of Machchakindi, and that, when she grew up, she was employed, as was
customary with the females of the Parava tribe, to ferry passengers
over the river. On a certain day, the sage Par&#257;sara having chanced
to meet her at the ferry, she became with child by him, and was
subsequently delivered of a son, the famous Vy&#257;sa who composed the
Pur&#257;nas. Her great personal charms afterwards induced King Santanu
of the lunar race to admit her to his royal bed, and by him she became
the mother of Vichitrav&#299;rya, the grandsire of the P&#257;ndavas
and Kauravas, whose contentions for the throne of Hastin&#257;p&#363;ra
form the subject of the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata. Hence the Paravas boast
of being allied to the lunar race, and call themselves accordingly,
besides displaying at their wedding feasts the banners and emblems
peculiar to it. In the drama of Alliaras&#257;ny, who is supposed to
have resided at Kudremall&#275; on the north-west coast of Ceylon, the
Paravas act a conspicuous part. We find them employed by the princess
in fishing for pearls off the coast, and that under a severe penalty
they were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>obliged to furnish her with ten kalams of pearls
every season.</p>
<p>It is noted, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, that &ldquo;there
are in reality three castes which answer to the name Paravan, and which
speak Tamil, Malay&#257;lam, and Canarese respectively. Probably all
three are descended from the Tamil Paravans or Paratavans. The Tamil
Paravans are fishermen on the sea coast. Their head-quarters is
Tuticorin, and their headman is called Talavan. They are mostly Native
Christians. They claim to be Kshatriyas of the P&#257;ndyan line of
kings, and will eat only in the houses of Br&#257;hmans. The
Malay&#257;lam Paravans are shell collectors, lime burners and
gymnasts, and their women act as midwives. Their titles are Kurup,
V&#257;rakurup, and N&#363;rankurup (n&#363;ru, lime). The Canarese
Paravas are umbrella-makers and devil-dancers.&rdquo; It has been
suggested that the west coast Paravas are the descendants of those who
fled from Tinnevelly, in order to avoid the oppression of the
Muhammadans.</p>
<p>In the Census Report, 1871, the Paravas are summed up as being a
fishing caste on the Madura and Tinnevelly coast, who &ldquo;were found
by the Portuguese, on their arrival in India, to be groaning under the
Muhammadan yoke, and were assisted by the Portuguese on condition of
their becoming Christians. This general conversion, for political ends,
explains why the fishing population of the present day along the
south-east coast is to a considerable extent Roman Catholic.&rdquo; It
is noted by Mr. S. P. Rice<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2058src" href=
"#xd21e2058" name="xd21e2058src">74</a> that the fishermen &ldquo;who
live in the extreme south are devout Catholics, and have preserved the
Portuguese names by which their fathers <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>were baptized into
the Church, so that, incongruous as it sounds, Jos&#275; Fernandez and
Maria Santiago are but humble folk, catching fish in a primitive way,
with no more clothing on than a small loin cloth and a picture of the
Virgin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the Paravas, Bald&aelig;us<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2065src" href="#xd21e2065" name="xd21e2065src">75</a> writes as
follows. &ldquo;The kingdom of Trevancor borders upon that of Coulang:
All along the Sea-shore inhabit the Paruas, who being for the most part
Christians, you see the Shore all along as far as Comoryn, and even
beyond it to Tutecoryn, full of little Churches, some of Wood, others
of Stone. These People owe their Conversion to Franciscus Xaverius, he
being the first who planted the Principles of Christianity among them;
they being so much taken with the reasonableness of the Ten
Commandments, that they receiv&rsquo;d Baptism in great numbers, tho an
accidental Quarrel between a Parua and a Mahometan prov&rsquo;d a
strong Motive to their Conversion.... The Paruas being sorely
oppress&rsquo;d by the Mahometans, one John de Crus, a Native of
Malabar, but who had been in Portugal, and honourably treated by John,
the then king of Portugal, advised them to seek for Aid at Cochin
against the Moors, and to receive Baptism. Accordingly some of the
chief Men among them (call&rsquo;d Patangatays in their Language) were
sent upon that Errand to Cochin, where being kindly receiv&rsquo;d,
they (in honour of him who had given His Advice) took upon them the
Sirname of Crus, a name still retain&rsquo;d by most Persons of Note
among the Paruas. In short, being deliver&rsquo;d from the Moorish
Yoke, and the Pearl-fishery (which formerly belong&rsquo;d to them)
restor&rsquo;d to the right Owners, above 20,000 of them receiv&rsquo;d
Baptism.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146"
name="pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The commencement of the Roman Catholic Mission in
Tinnevelly,&rdquo; Bishop Caldwell writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2071src" href="#xd21e2071" name="xd21e2071src">76</a>
&ldquo;dates from 1532, when certain Paravas, representatives of the
Paravas or fishing caste, visited Cochin for the purpose of
supplicating the aid of the Portuguese against their Muhammadan
oppressors, and were baptized there by Michael Vaz, Vicar-General of
the Bishop of Goa. The same ecclesiastic, with other priests,
accompanied the fleet which sailed for the purpose of chastising the
Muhammadans, and, as soon as that object was accomplished, set about
baptizing the Paravas all along the coast, in accordance with the
agreement into which their representatives had entered. The entire
Parava caste adopted the religion of their Portuguese deliverers and
most of them received baptism. Some, however, did not receive baptism
for some cause till Xavier&rsquo;s time, ten years afterwards. Xavier,
on his arrival in the south, could not speak Tamil, and spent some
months in committing to memory Tamil translations of the Creed,
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, Ave Maria, and Decalogue. He then proceeded to
visit all the villages of the coast, bell in hand, to collect the
inhabitants, and gave them Christian instruction. The Paravas thus
christianised&mdash;called generally at that time the Comorin
Christians&mdash;inhabited thirty villages, and numbered, according to
the most credible account, twenty thousand souls. These villages
extended all the way along the coast at irregular intervals from Cape
Comorin to the island promontory of R&#257;m&#275;svaram, if not
beyond. It does not appear that any village in the interior joined in
the movement.&rdquo; &ldquo;It appears,&rdquo; Mr. Casie Chitty states,
&ldquo;that the Portuguese treated the Paravas with great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>kindness, permitted intermarriages, and even
allowed them to assume their surnames, so that we find among them many
Da Limas, Da Cruzs, Da Andrados, Da Canhas, etc. They gave the chief of
the Paravas the title of Dom, and allowed him the exclusive right of
wearing a gold chain with a cross as a badge of nobility. [The name of
a recent hereditary chief or J&#257;ti Talaivan or Talaivamore of the
Paravas was Gabriel de Cruz Lazarus Motha Vas.] As soon as the Dutch
took possession of Tutocoryn (Tuticorin) and other adjacent towns where
the Paravas are found, they employed Dr. Bald&aelig;us and a few other
ministers of their persuasion to suppress the Roman Catholic faith, and
to persuade the Paravas to adopt their own in its stead; but in this
they met with a total failure, and were once very nearly bringing on a
general revolt. Notwithstanding the intolerance of the Dutch with
regard to the Romish Church, the Paravas still remember them with
gratitude, as they afforded them the means of extensive livelihood by
establishing in their principal town (Tutocoryn) a public manufactory
of cloth, and thus maintaining a considerable working
capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the history of the Paravas, and their connection with the
pearl-fisheries on the Indian side of the Gulf of Manaar, much
information is given by Mr. J. Hornell,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2078src" href="#xd21e2078" name="xd21e2078src">77</a> from whose
account the following extracts are taken. &ldquo;When the Portuguese
rounded Cape Comorin, they found the pearl fisheries of the Gulf of
Manaar in the hands of the Paravas, whom tradition shows to have had
control of this industry from time immemorial. Of the origin of these
people we know extremely little. We know, however, that in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>the
old days, from 600 B.C. and for 1,500 years or more thereafter, the
country now comprehended in the districts of Madura and Tinnevelly
formed the great Tamil kingdom of P&#257;ndya. And, in the old Tamil
work called the Kalveddu, the position of the pearl-fishing caste to
this monarchy is incidentally mentioned in the following extract:
&lsquo;Vidanarayanen Cheddi and the Paravu men who fished pearls by
paying tribute to Alliyarasani, daughter of Pandya, king of Madura, who
went on a voyage, experienced bad weather in the sea, and were driven
to the shores of Lanka, where they founded Karainerkai and
Kutiraimalai. Vidanarayanen Cheddi had the treasures of his ship stored
there by the Paravas, and established pearl fisheries at Kadalihilapam
and Kallachihilapam, and introduced the trees which change iron into
gold.&rsquo; In the Maduraik-kanchi the Paravas are described as being
most powerful in the country round Korkai. &lsquo;Well fed on fish and
armed with bows, their hordes terrified their enemies by their dashing
valour.&rsquo; The Maduraik-kanchi describes Korkai as the chief town
in the country of Parathavar and the seat of the pearl fishery, with a
population consisting chiefly of pearl divers and chank
cutters.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2083src" href="#xd21e2083" name=
"xd21e2083src">78</a> When the Pandyan kingdom was powerful, the
Paravas had grants of certain rights from the monarchy, paying tribute
from the produce of the fisheries, and receiving protection and
immunity from taxation in return. The conditions under which the
Paravas lived at the opening of the sixteenth century are graphically
set forth in a report, dated 19th December, 1669, written by Van Reede
and Laurens Pyh, respectively Commandant of the coast of Malabar and
Canara and senior merchant and Chief of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>the sea-ports of
Madura. Under the protection of those R&#257;jas there lived a people,
which had come to these parts from other countries<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2091src" href="#xd21e2091" name=
"xd21e2091src">79</a>&mdash;they are called Paravas&mdash;they lived a
seafaring life, gaining their bread by fishing and by diving for
pearls; they had purchased from the petty R&#257;jas small streaks of
the shore, along which they settled and built villages, and they
divided themselves as their numbers progressively increased. In these
purchased lands they lived under the rule of their own headmen, paying
to the R&#257;jas only an annual present, free from all other taxes
which bore upon the natives so heavily, looked upon as strangers,
exempt from tribute or subjection to the R&#257;jas, having a chief of
their own election, whose descendants are still called kings of the
Paravas, and who drew a revenue from the whole people, which in process
of time has spread itself from Quilon to Bengal. Their importance and
power have not been reduced by this dispersion, for they are seen at
every pearl fishery (on which occasions the Paravas assemble together)
surpassing in distinction, dignity and outward honours all other
persons there. The pearl fishery was the principal resource and
expedient from which the Paravas obtained a livelihood, but as from
their residence so near the sea they had no manner of disposing of
their pearls, they made an agreement with the R&#257;jas that a market
day should be proclaimed throughout their dominions, when merchants
might securely come from all parts of India, and at which the divers
and sutlers necessary to furnish provisions for the multitude might
also meet; and, as this assemblage would consist of two different
races, namely, the Paravas and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150"
href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>subjects of the R&#257;jas,
as well as strangers and travellers, two kinds of guards and tribunals
were to be established to prevent all disputes and quarrels arising
during this open market, every man being subject to his own judge, and
his case being decided by him; all payments were then also divided
among the headmen of the Paravas, who were the owners of that fishery,
and who hence became rich and powerful; they had weapons and soldiers
of their own, with which they were able to defend themselves against
the violence of the R&#257;jas or their subjects. The Moors who had
spread themselves over India, and principally along the coasts of
Madura, were strengthened by the natives professing Muhammadanism, and
by the Arabs, Saracens, and the privateers of the Sammoryn,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2097src" href="#xd21e2097" name=
"xd21e2097src">80</a> and they began also to take to pearl-diving as an
occupation, but being led away by ill-feeling and hope of gain, they
often attempted to outreach the Paravas, some of whom even they gained
to their party and to their religion, by which means they obtained so
much importance, that the R&#257;jas joined themselves to the Moors,
anticipating great advantages from the trade which they carried on, and
from their power at sea; and thus the Paravas were oppressed, although
they frequently rose against their adversaries, but they always got the
worst of it, until at last in a pearl fishery at Tutucoryn, having
purposely raised a dispute, they fell upon the Moors, and killed some
thousands of them, burnt their vessels, and remained masters of the
country, though much in fear that the Moors, joined by the pirates of
Calicut, would rise against them in revenge. The Portuguese arrived
about this time with one ship at Tutucoryn; the Paravas requested them
for assistance, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151"
name="pb151">151</a>]</span>and obtained a promise of it, on conditions
that they should become Christians; this they generally agreed to, and,
having sent Commissioners with some of the Portuguese to Goa, they were
received under the protection of that nation, and their Commissioners
returned with priests, and a naval force conveying troops, on which all
the Paravas of the seven ports were baptized, accepted as subjects of
the King of Portugal, and they dwindled thus from having their own
chiefs and their own laws into subordination to priests and Portuguese,
who however settled the rights and privileges of the Paravas so firmly
that the R&#257;jas no longer dared interfere with them, or attempt to
impede or abridge their prerogative; on the contrary they were
compelled to admit of separate laws for the Paravas from those which
bound their own subjects. The Portuguese kept for themselves the
command at sea, the pearl fisheries, the sovereignty over the Paravas,
their villages and harbours, whilst the Naick of Madura, who was a
subject of the King of the Carnatic, made himself master at this time
of the lands about Madura, and in a short time afterwards of all the
lower countries from Cape Comoryn to Tanjore, expelling and rooting out
all the princes and land proprietors, who were living and reigning
there; but, on obtaining the sovereignty of all these countries, he
wished to subject the Paravas to his authority, in which attempt he was
opposed by the Portuguese, who often, not being powerful enough
effectually to resist, left the land with the priests and Paravas, and
went to the islands of Manaar and Jaffnapatam, from whence they sent
coasting vessels along the Madura shores, and caused so much disquiet
that the revenue was ruined, trade circumscribed, and almost
annihilated, for which reasons the Naick himself was obliged to solicit
the Portuguese to come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href=
"#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>back again. The Political
Government of India, perceiving the great benefit of the pearl fishery,
appointed in the name of the King of Portugal military chiefs and
captains to superintend it, leaving the churches and their
administration to the priests. Those captains obtained from the
fisheries each time a profit of 6,000 rix-dollars for the king, leaving
the remainder of the income from them for the Paravas; but, seeing they
could not retain their superiority in that manner over the people,
which was becoming rich, luxurious, drunken, with prosperity, and with
the help of the priests, who protected them, threatening the captains,
which often occasioned great disorders, the latter determined to build
a fort for the king at Tutucoryn, which was the chief place of all the
villages; but the priests who feared by this to lose much of their
consequence as well as of their revenue, insisted that, if such a
measure was proceeded with, they would all be ruined, on which account
they urged on the people to commit irregularities, and made the Paravas
fear that the step was a preliminary one to the making all of them
slaves; and they therefore raised such hindrances to the work that it
never could be completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Paravas,&rdquo; Mr. Hornell continues, &ldquo;although
the original holders of the fishery rights, had begun, prior to the
arrival of the Portuguese, to feel the competition of the restless
Muhammadan settlers on the coast, who, coming, as many must have done,
from the coast of the Persian Gulf, knew already all there was to know
of pearl-fishing. The descendants of these Arabs and their proselytes,
known as Moros to the Portuguese, are the Moormen or Lubbais of to-day.
Their chief settlement was Kayal, a town situated near the mouth of the
river Tambrapurni, and which in Marco Polo&rsquo;s time (1290&ndash;91)
was a great and noble city. It shared <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>with Tuticorin for
fully 500 years the honour of being one of the two great pearl markets
of the coast&mdash;the one being the Moor, the other the Parava,
head-quarters.... Menezes, writing in 1622, states that for many years
the fisheries had become extinct because of the great poverty into
which the Paravas had fallen. Tuticorin, and the sovereignty of the
pearl banks and of the Paravas, passed to the Dutch in 1658.</p>
<p>In the report of the pearl fishery, 1708, the following entries
occur in the list of free stones according to ancient
customs:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>96&frac12; to the Naick of Madura&mdash;4 Xtian, 92&frac12;
Moorish;</li>
<li>10 to Head Moorman of Cailpatnam&mdash;5 Xtian, 5 Moorish.</li>
<li>60 to Theuver&mdash;60 Moorish.</li>
<li>185 to the Pattangatyns of this coast&mdash;all Xtian stones.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The 185 stones,&rdquo; Mr. Hornell writes, &ldquo;given to
the Pattangatyns or headmen of the Paravas was in the nature of
remuneration to these men for assistance in inspecting the banks, in
guarding any oyster banks discovered, in recruiting divers, and in
superintending operations during the course of the fishery.... In 1889,
the Madras Government recorded its appreciation of the assistance
rendered by the Jati Talaivan, and directed that his privilege of being
allowed the take of two boats be continued. Subsequently, in 1891, the
Government, while confirming the general principle of privilege
remuneration to the Jati Talaivan, adopted the more satisfactory
regulation of placing the extent of the remuneration upon the basis of
a sliding scale, allowing him but one boat when the Government boats
numbered 30 or less, two for 31 to 60 boats, three for 61 to 90
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>boats employed, and so on in this ratio. The
value of the Jati Talaivan&rsquo;s two privilege boats in the 1890
fishery was Rs. 1,424, in that of 1900 only Rs. 172.&rdquo; The
J&#257;di Talaiv&#257;n is said to have been denominated by the Dutch
the prince of the seven havens. It is noted in the pearl fishery
report, 1900, that &ldquo;the Paravas are a constant source of trouble,
both on the banks and in the kottoo (shed), where they were constantly
being caught concealing oysters, which of course were always
confiscated. Only one Arab was caught doing this, and his companions
abused him for disgracing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Mr. Casie Chitty, the Paravas are divided into thirteen
classes, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Headmen.</li>
<li>Dealers in cloth.</li>
<li>Divers for corals.</li>
<li>Sailors.</li>
<li>Divers for pearl-oysters.</li>
<li>Divers for chanks.</li>
<li>Packers of cloth.</li>
<li>Fishers who catch tortoises (turtles).</li>
<li>Fishers who catch porpoises.</li>
<li>Fishers who catch sharks and other fish.</li>
<li>Palanquin bearers.</li>
<li>Peons, who wait about the person of the Chief.</li>
<li>Fishers, who catch crabs.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is noted by Canon A. Margoschis that the Parava females are
famous for the excessive dilatation of the lobes of the ears, and for
wearing therein the heaviest and most expensive gold ear jewels made of
sovereigns. Ordinary jewels are said to cost Rs. 200, but heavy jewels
are worth Rs. 1,000 and even more. The longer the ears, the more jewels
can be used, and this appears to be the rationale of elongated ears.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span></p>
<p>In a recent account of a Parava wedding in high life, I
read<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2161src" href="#xd21e2161" name=
"xd21e2161src">81</a> that &ldquo;the bride and bridegroom proceeded to
the church at the head of an imposing procession, with music and
banners. The service, which was fully choral, was conducted by a priest
from their own community, after which the newly wedded couple went in
procession to the residence of the J&#257;ti Talavamore, being escorted
by their distinguished host in person. The J&#257;ti Talavamore, who
wore a picturesque, if somewhat antiquated, robe, rode in a gorgeously
upholstered palanquin, with banners, trophies, elephants, and other
emblems of his high office. The bride, who was resplendent with
diamonds, was becomingly attired in a purple Benares s&#257;ri with
gold floral designs, and wore a superb kincob bodice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the Paravans of Travancore, Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar
writes that &ldquo;they are found in most t&#257;luks of the State. The
title sometimes used by them is Kuruppu. The Paravans of
Chengann&#363;r and Tiruvella call themselves Chakka, a word supposed
by the castemen to be derived from slaghya or praiseworthy, but perhaps
more correctly from Chakku, the basket carried by them in their hands.
The Paravans are divided into numerous sections. In the south, the
Tamil-speaking division follows the makkath&#257;yam, while all the
Malay&#257;lam-speaking sections follow the marumakath&#257;yam law of
inheritance. There is also a difference in the dress and ornaments of
the two sections, the former adopting the fashion of the east coast,
and the latter that of the west. The Travancore Paravas are really one
with the Tamil-speaking Paravas of the east coast. While most of them
became converts to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156"
name="pb156">156</a>]</span>Christianity, in Travancore they have tried
to preserve their separate existence, as they had already spread into
the interior of the country before the proselytism of St. Xavier had
made its enduring mark on the sea-coast villages. There is a curious
legend about the settlement of the Chakkas in Central Travancore.
Formerly, it would appear, they were S&#363;dras, but, for some social
offence committed by them, they were outcasted by the Edappalli
chieftain. They were once great devotees of Sr&#299; Krishna, the lord
of Tiruvaranmulai in the Tiruvella t&#257;luk. The Paravas say further
that they are descended from a high-caste woman married to an Izhava.
The word Parava is accordingly derived from para, which in Sanskrit
means foreign. The Paravas engage in various occupations, of which the
most important in Central Travancore are climbing palm trees, catching
fish, and washing clothes for Christians, Muhammadans, and depressed
classes of Hindus. In South Travancore they make wicker baskets, rattan
chairs, and sofas. Women, in all parts of the State, are lime and shell
burners. They worship at the Aranmula temple, and pay special worship
to Bhadrak&#257;li. Their priest is known as Parakuruppu, who, having
to perform four different functions, is also entitled
N&#257;lonnuk&#257;ran. It is his duty to preside at marriage and other
rites, to be caste barber, to carry the news of death to the relations,
and to perform the priestly functions at funerals. The Paravas perform

them, as designs for tattooing or to be drawn on the floor on occasions
of festival and ceremonial.</p>
<p><b>Pariv&#257;ra.&mdash;</b>A sub-division of Bant.</p>
<p><b>Pariv&#257;ram.&mdash;</b>It is noted, in the Census Report,
1891, that &ldquo;this is a caste, which presents some difficulty.
Pariv&#257;ram means &lsquo;an army, a retinue,&rsquo; and it is
alleged that the people of this caste were formerly soldiers.
Pariv&#257;ram is found as a sub-division of Maravan and Agamudaiyan,
and the Pariv&#257;ras of Madura and Tinnevelly are probably either a
sub-division or an offshoot of the Maravans. In Coimbatore, the only
other district in which the Pariv&#257;ras are numerous, they seem to
be a sub-division of Toreyas, a fishing caste, and Mr. Rice, in his
Gazetteer (of Mysore), says that Pariv&#257;ra is a synonym of
Besta.&rdquo; Further, in the Census Report, 1901, it is stated that
&ldquo;the word Pariv&#257;ram means &lsquo;a retinue,&rsquo; and was
probably originally only an occupational term. It is now-a-days applied
to the domestic servants and the Tottiya zamindars in the districts of
Coimbatore, Trichinopoly, Madura, and Tinnevelly, who are recruited
from several castes, but have come to form a caste by themselves. The
K&#333;t&#257;ris of South Canara are a somewhat parallel case, and
probably in time the Paiks among the Oriyas, and the Kh&#257;sas, who
are servants to the Telugu zamindars, will similarly develop into
separate castes. The caste is said to require all its members of both
sexes to do such service for its masters as they may require. Persons
of any caste above the Paraiyas are admitted into its ranks, and the
men in it may marry a woman of any other caste with the permission of
the zamindar under whom they serve. They do not habitually employ
Br&#257;hmans as priests, and in places the head of the Tottiyan caste
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>conducts their ceremonies. Their titles are
Maniyag&#257;ran and S&#275;rvaig&#257;ran. The latter is also used by
the Agamudaiyans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The title S&#275;rvaig&#257;ran or Servaik&#257;ran indicates that
members of the caste do servai, or service, and the further title
&#363;liyakk&#257;ran is a sign that they do &#363;liyam, or menial
work. S&#275;rvaik&#257;ran is also a title of the Tamil
Ambalak&#257;rans, Agamudaiyans, Kallans, and Maravans, and the
Canarese Toreyas, some of whom have settled in the Tamil districts of
Madura and Coimbatore. It also occurs as a synonym of the Canarese
K&#333;t&#275;garas.</p>
<p>The illegitimate offspring of Maravans, Kallans, and Agamudaiyans,
are said to become members of the mixed Pariv&#257;ram caste.</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that the
Pariv&#257;ram caste &ldquo;is divided into two endogamous sections;
the Chinna &#362;liyam (little services) who are palanquin-bearers, and
have the title T&#275;van, and the Periya &#362;liyam (big services),
who are called Maniyak&#257;ran. The K&#333;mbai Pariv&#257;rams, who
are the servants of the K&#257;ppiliyan Zamindars of K&#333;mbai and
T&#275;v&#257;ram in the Periyakulam t&#257;luk, are a separate
community, and do not intermarry with the others. When a girl attains
maturity, she is kept for sixteen days in a hut, which is guarded at
night by her relations. This is afterwards burnt down, and the pots she
used are broken into very small pieces, as there is an idea that, if
rain-water collects in any of them, the girl will be childless. Some of
the ceremonies at weddings are unusual. On the first day, a man takes a
big pot of water with a smaller empty pot on top of it, and marches
three times round the open space in front of the bride&rsquo;s house.
With him march the happy couple carrying a bamboo, to which are tied in
a turmeric-coloured cloth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href=
"#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>the nine kinds of grain. After the
third journey round, these things are put down at the north-east
corner, and the marriage pandal is made by bringing three more poles of
the same size. Afterwards the wrists of the couple are tied together,
and bridegroom&rsquo;s brother carries the pair a short distance. They
plunge their hands into a bowl of salt. Next the husband takes an
ordinary stone rolling-pin, wraps it in a bit of cloth, and gives it to
his wife, saying &lsquo;Take the child; I am going to the
palace.&rsquo; She takes it, replying &lsquo;Yes, give me the child,
the milk is ready.&rsquo; This has to be repeated three times in a set
formula. Several other odd rites are observed. Br&#257;hmans officiate,
and the bridegroom&rsquo;s sister, as usual, ties the t&#257;li.
Divorce is allowed to both sides. Adultery within the caste, or with
the Zamindar, is tolerated. The husbands accept as their own any
children their wives may bear to the Zamindar. Such children are called
Chinna Kambalattar, and may marry with Tottiyans. But adultery outside
the caste is most rigorously prohibited, and sternly punished with
excommunication. A mud image of the girl who so offends is made, two
thorns are poked into its eyes, and it is thrown away outside the
village.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Patnaik.&mdash;</b>A title of Karnam.</p>
<p><b>Patn&#363;lk&#257;ran.&mdash;</b>The Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans are
described, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as &ldquo;a caste of
foreign weavers found in all the Tamil districts, but mainly in Madura
town, who speak Patn&#363;li or Khatri, a dialect of Gujar&#257;ti, and
came originally from Gujar&#257;t. They have always been known here as
Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans, or silk thread people. They are referred to in
the inscriptions of Kum&#257;ra Gupta (A.D. 473) at Mandas&#333;r,
south of Gujar&#257;t, by the name of Pattav&#257;yaka, which is the
Sanskrit equivalent of Patn&#363;lk&#257;ran, and the s&#257;sanam of
Queen Mangamm&#257;l of Madura, mentioned below, speaks of them by the
same name, but lately they have taken to calling themselves
Saur&#257;shtras from the Saur&#257;shtra country from which they came.
They also claim to be Br&#257;hmans. They thus frequently entered
themselves in the schedules as Saur&#257;shtra Br&#257;hmans. They are
an intelligent and hard-working community, and deserve every sympathy
in the efforts which they are making to elevate the material prosperity
of their members and improve their educational condition, but a claim
to Br&#257;hmanhood is a difficult matter to establish. They say that
their claim is denied because they are weavers by profession, which
none of the Southern Br&#257;hmans are, and because the Br&#257;hmans
of the Tamil country do not understand their rites, which are the
northern rites. The Mandas&#333;r inscriptions, however, represent them
as soldiers as well as weavers, which does not sound Br&#257;hmanical,
and the Tamil Br&#257;hmans have never raised any objections to the
Gauda Br&#257;hmans calling themselves such, different as their ways
are from those current in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href=
"#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>the south. In Madura their claim
to Br&#257;hmanhood has always been disputed. As early as 1705 A.D. the
Br&#257;hmans of Madura called in question the Patn&#363;lkarans&rsquo;
right to perform the annual up&#257;karma (or renewal of the sacred
thread) in the Br&#257;hman fashion. [Eighteen members of the community
were arrested by the Governor of Madura for performing this ceremony.]
The matter was taken to the notice of the Queen Mangamm&#257;l, and she
directed her State pandits to convene meetings of learned men, and to
examine into it. On their advice, she issued a cadj&#257;n (palm leaf)
s&#257;sanam (grant) which permitted them to follow the
Br&#257;hmanical rites. But all the twice-born&mdash;whether
Br&#257;hmans, Kshatriyas, or Vaisyas&mdash;are entitled to do the
same, and the s&#257;sanam establishes little. The Patn&#363;ls point
out that, in some cases, their g&#333;tras are Br&#257;hmanical. But,
in many instances which could be quoted, Kshatriyas had also
Br&#257;hmanical g&#333;tras.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is stated, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that the
inscription at Mandas&#333;r in Western M&#257;lwa &ldquo;relates how
the Pattav&#257;yas, as the caste was then called, were induced to
migrate thither from L&#257;ta on the coast of Gujar&#257;t by king
Kum&#257;ra Gupta (or one of his lieutenants), to practice there their
art of silk-weaving. The inscription says many flattering things about
the community, and poetically compares the city to a beautiful woman,
and the immigrants to the silk garments in which she decks herself when
she goes to meet her lover. [The inscription further records that,
while the noble Bandhuvarman was governing this city of Dasapura, which
had been brought to a state of great prosperity, a noble and unequalled
temple of the bright-rayed (sun) was caused to be built by the
silk-cloth weavers (pattav&#257;yair) as a guild with the stores of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>wealth acquired by (the exercise of their)
craft.] On the destruction of Mandas&#333;r by the Mussalmans, the
Pattav&#257;yas seem to have travelled south to D&#275;vagiri, the
modern Daulat&#257;b&#257;d, the then capital of the Y&#257;davas, and
thence, when the Mussalmans again appeared on the scene at the
beginning of the fourteenth century, to Vijayanagar, and eventually to
Madura. A curious ceremony confirming this conjecture is performed to
this day at Patn&#363;lk&#257;ran weddings in South India. Before the
date of the wedding, the bridegroom&rsquo;s party go to the
bride&rsquo;s house, and ask formally for the girl&rsquo;s hand. Her
relations ask them in a set form of words who they are, and whence they
come, and they reply that they are from S&#333;rath (the old name for
Saur&#257;shtra or Kathiawar), resided in D&#275;vagiri, travelled
south (owing to Mussalman oppression) to Vijayanagar, and thence came
to Madura. They then ask the bride&rsquo;s party the same question, and
receive the same reply. A Mar&#257;thi MS., prepared in 1822 at Salem
under the direction of the then Collector, Mr. M. D. Cockburn, contains
the same tradition. Mr. Sewell&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Forgotten Empire:
Vijayanagar&rsquo; shows how common silk clothing and trappings were at
Vijayanagar in the days of its glory. Most of the
Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans can still speak Telugu, which raises the
inference that they must have resided a long time in the Telugu
country, while their Patn&#363;li contains many Canarese and Telugu
words, and they observe the feast of Basavanna (or Boskanna), which is
almost peculiar to the Bellary country. After the downfall of
Vijayanagar, some of the caste seem to have gone to Bangalore, for a
weaving community called Patv&#275;gars, who speak a dialect similar to
Patn&#363;li, still reside there.&rdquo; Concerning the Patn&#363;lis
who have settled in the Mysore Province, it is noted, in the Mysore
Census Report, 1891, that &ldquo;with silk they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>manufacture a fine stuff called katni, which no
other weavers are said to be able to prepare. It is largely used by
Mussalmans for trousers and lungas (gowns). It is said that Haider Ali,
while returning from his expeditions against Madras, forcibly brought
with him some twenty-five families of these weavers, who were living in
the Tanjore district, and established them at Ganjam near Seringapatam,
and, in order to encourage silk and velvet weaving, exempted them from
certain taxes. The industry flourished till the fall of Seringapatam,
when most of the class fled from the country, a few only having
survived those troublous times. At present there are only 254 souls
returned to these people, employed in making carpets in
Bangalore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Patn&#363;lk&#257;rs,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2288src" href="#xd21e2288" name=
"xd21e2288src">84</a> &ldquo;say that they were originally
Br&#257;hmans, living in a town of Surat called D&#275;vagiri, in which
twelve streets were entirely peopled by them. For some reason, of which
they profess themselves to be ignorant, the residents of one of these
streets were excommunicated by the rest of the caste, and expelled.
They travelled southwards, and settled in Tirupati, Arni, and Vellore,
as well as in Trichinopoly, Tanjore, Madura, and other large towns,
where they carried on their trade of silk-weaving. Another story is to
the effect that they were bound to produce a certain number of silken
cloths at each D&#299;p&#257;vali feast in D&#275;vagiri for the
goddess Lakshmi. One year their supply fell short, and they were cursed
by the goddess, who decreed that they should no longer be regarded as
Br&#257;hmans. They, however, still claim to be such, and follow the
customs of that caste, though they refuse to eat with them. They
acknowledge priests <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165"
name="pb165">165</a>]</span>from among themselves, as well as from
among Br&#257;hmans, and profess to look down upon all other castes. In
religion they are divided into Smartas, Vaishnavas, and
Vy&#257;p&#257;ris, some among the Smartas being Lingayats. Those who
can write usually employ the Telugu characters in writing their
language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans, according to one tradition, claim
descent from a certain Br&#257;hman sage, known as Tantuvardhanar,
meaning literally a person who improves threads, <i>i.e.</i>,
manufactures and weaves them into cloths. This is, it is suggested,
probably only an eponymous hero.</p>
<p>In the Manual of the Madura district, the Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans are
described as &ldquo;a caste of Surat silk-weavers, whose ancestors were
induced to settle in Madura by one of the earlier N&#257;yakkan kings,
or in response to an invitation from Tirumala Naik, and who have
thriven so well that they now form by far the most numerous of all the
castes resident in the town of Madura. They are very skilful and
industrious workmen, and many of them have become very wealthy. They
keep altogether aloof from other castes, and live independently of
general society, speaking a foreign tongue, and preserving intact the
customs of the land of their origin. They are easily distinguished in
appearance from Tamils, being of a light yellowish colour, and having
handsomer and more intelligent features. They are called Chettis or
merchants by Tamils.&rdquo; In a recent note,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2301src" href="#xd21e2301" name="xd21e2301src">85</a> the
Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans of Madura are described as being
&ldquo;exceedingly gregarious; they live together in large numbers in
small houses, and their social status in the country is quite
unsettled. Though they delight to call themselves Saur&#257;shtra
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>Br&#257;hmans, the Tamils consider them to be a
low caste. Like the Br&#257;hmans, they wear the sacred thread, and
tack on to their names such titles as Iyengar, Iyer, Rao, Bhagavather,
Sastrigal, and so forth, though the conservatives among them still
cling to the time-honoured simple Chetti. Child marriage is the rule,
and widow marriage is never practiced. Hindus by religion, they worship
indiscriminately both the Siva and Vaishnava deities, but all of them
wear big Iyengar n&#257;mams on their foreheads, even more prominently
than do the real Iyengars themselves. All of them pass for pure
vegetarians. The proud position of Madura to this day as second city in
the Presidency is mainly, if not solely, due to her prosperous and
industrious community of Saur&#257;shtra merchants and silk-weavers,
who have now grown into nearly half her population, and who have also
come to a foremost place among the ranks of her citizens. They have
their representatives to-day in the Municipal Councils and in the Local
and District Boards. Their perseverance has won for them a place in the
D&#275;vast&#257;nam Committee of one of the most prosperous temples in
the district. But, in spite of their affluence and leading position it
must be confessed that they are essentially a &lsquo;backward
class&rsquo; in respect of English education and enlightenment. They
are, however, making steady progress. An English high school for
Saur&#257;shtra boys, and a number of elementary schools for girls, are
now maintained by the Saur&#257;shtra Sabha for the proper education of
their children.&rdquo; In 1906, a member of the community was appointed
a member of the committee of the Sr&#299; Kalla Alagar temple in the
Madura district.</p>
<p>In an order of the Director of Public Instruction, in 1900, it was
laid down that &ldquo;Saur&#257;shtras having been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>recognised (in 1892) as a backward class falling
under Pattunulgars, the manager cannot continue to enjoy the privileges
accorded under the grant-in-aid code to schools intended for backward
classes, if he returns his pupils as Br&#257;hmans. If the pupils have
been returned as Saur&#257;shtra Br&#257;hmans, the manager should be
requested to revise, as no such caste is recognised.&rdquo; A
deputation had an interview with the Director, and it was subsequently
ruled that &ldquo;Saur&#257;shtras will continue to be treated as a
backward class. Pupils belonging to the above class should invariably
be returned in future as Saur&#257;shtras, whether the word
Br&#257;hman is added or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a &ldquo;History of the Saur&#257;shtras in Southern
India&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2312src" href="#xd21e2312"
name="xd21e2312src">86</a> it is recorded that &ldquo;when the
Saur&#257;shtras settled in the south, they reproduced the institutions
of their mother country in the new land; but, owing to the influence of
the Southern Dravidians, some of the institutions became extinct.
During their migrations, the men were under the guidance of their
leader, and the process of migration tended to increase the power of
kinship. The people were divided into four heads, called Goundas
(chiefs), Saulins (elders), V&#333;yddoos (physicians), and Bhoutuls
(religious men). Some traces of the division still survive in the now
neglected institution of Goundans. The Goundans were supposed to be
responsible for the acts and doings of their men. The masses enjoyed
the property under the joint undivided Hindu family system as
prescribed in the Code of Manu. The chiefs were the judges in both
civil and criminal affairs. They were aided in deciding cases by a body
of nobles called Saulins. The office of the Saulins is to make
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>enquiries, and try all cases connected with the
community, and to abide by the decision of the chiefs. The
V&#333;yddoos (pandits) and Bhoutuls (Josis and Kavis also ranked with
V&#333;yddas and Bhoutuls) had their honours on all important
occasions, and they are placed in the same rank with the elders. The
Karestuns, or the Commons, are the whole body of the masses. Their
voice is necessary on certain important occasions, as during the
ceremonies of excommunication, and prayaschittas for admitting
renegades, and during periodical meetings of the community. The
Goundans at present are not exercising any of their powers, except in
some religious matters. Saur&#257;shtra Br&#257;hmans were originally
leading a purely religious life, but now they have begun to do business
of different descriptions fitted to their position. Their chief
occupation is agriculture, but some are trading, dyeing and weaving;
however, it can be safely affirmed that their business interferes in no
way with their religious creed and ceremonies. The name Patnulgar means
silk weavers, and is sometimes erroneously applied to the
Saur&#257;shtras too; but, on the contrary, the term strictly applies
to all classes of weavers in Southern India, called Seniyars,
Kaikkolars, D&#275;v&#257;ngas, Kshatris (Khattris), Parayas,
Sengundas, Mudaliars, Saliyurs, Padmasalays, but not to the
Saur&#257;shtras in any way. The Saur&#257;shtras are now seen as a
mercantile community. They are brave but humble, god-fearing,
hospitable, fond of festivities and amusement. The Saur&#257;shtras, it
is said, were originally a class of sun worshippers, from sour&#257;
meaning sun, but the term Saur&#257;shtra means inhabitants of the
fruitful kingdom. Their religion is Hinduism, and they were originally
Madhv&#257;s. After their settlement in Southern India, some of them,
owing to the preachings of Sankaracharya <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>and Ramanujacharya,
were converted into Saivites and Vaishnavites respectively. The
Saur&#257;shtras belong to the Aksobhya and Sankaracharya Matas. The
Saur&#257;shtras, like other nations of India, are divided into four
great divisions, viz., Brahma, Kshatriya, Vaisya and S&#363;dra. The
Vaisyas and S&#363;dras are to be found in almost all towns and
villages, and especially at Tirupati, Nagari, Naranavanam, Arni,
Kottar, Palani, Palamcottah, Vilangudi, and Viravanallur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The affairs of the Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans at Madura are managed by a
Saur&#257;shtra Sabha, which was started in 1895. Among the laudable
objects for which the Sabha was established, the following may be
noted:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To manage the Madura Saur&#257;shtra school, and
establish reading-rooms, libraries, etc., with a view to enable members
of the Saur&#257;shtra community to receive, on moderate terms, a
sound, liberal, general and technical education.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To manage the temple known as the Madura Sr&#299;
Prasanna Venkat&#275;swara Sw&#257;mi&rsquo;s temple, and contribute
towards its maintenance by constructing, repairing and preserving
buildings in connection therewith, making jewels, vehicles and other
things necessary therefor, and conducting the festivals thereof.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To found charitable institutions, such as orphanages,
hospitals, poor-houses, choultries (resting-places for travellers),
water-sheds, and other things of a like nature for the good of the
Saur&#257;shtra community.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) To give succour to the suffering poor, and the maimed,
the lame, and the blind in the Saur&#257;shtra community.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) To give pecuniary grants in aid of upanayanams (thread
marriages) to the helpless in the Saur&#257;shtra community.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span></p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) To erect such works of utility as bathing ghauts, wells,
water fountains, and other works of utility for the benefit of the
Saur&#257;shtra community.</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) To fix and raise subscriptions known as mahamais (a sort
of income-tax).</p>
<p>Among the subjects of the lectures delivered in connection with the
Saur&#257;shtra Upanyasa Sabha at Madura in 1901 were the life of Mrs.
Annie Besant, the Paris Exhibition of 1900, Mr. Tata and higher
education, Saur&#257;shtra bank, Columbus, and the Saur&#257;shtra
reform hotel.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the Saur&#257;shtra community submitted a memorial
to the Governor of Madras to the effect that &ldquo;as the backward
Saur&#257;shtra community have not the requisite capital of half a lakh
of rupees for imparting to their members both general and technical
education, the Saur&#257;shtra Sabha, Madura, suggests that a lottery
office may be kept for collecting shares at one rupee each from such of
the public at large as may be willing to give the same, on the
understanding that, every time the collections aggregate to Rs. 6,250,
Rs. 250 should be set apart for the expenses of working the said
office, and two-thirds of the remainder for educational purposes, and
one-third should be awarded by drawing lots among the subscribers in
the shape of five prizes, ranging from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 125.&rdquo; In
passing orders on this sporting scheme, the Government stated that it
was not prepared to authorise the lottery. It has been well
said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2362src" href="#xd21e2362" name=
"xd21e2362src">87</a> that the Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans have a very
strong <i>esprit de corps</i>, and this has stood them in good stead in
their weaving, which is more scientifically carried on, and in a more
flourishing condition than is usual elsewhere. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p>For the following note on the Patn&#363;lk&#257;ran weavers of
Madura, I am indebted to Mr. A. Chatterton, Director of Technical
Enquiries:&mdash;&ldquo;As a general rule, they are in a flourishing
condition, and much better off than the Saur&#257;shtra weavers in
Salem. This is probably due to the fact that the bulk of the Madura
trade is in a higher class of cloth than at Salem, and the weavers are
consequently less affected by fluctuations in demand for their goods
due to seasonal variations. In various ways the Saur&#257;shtras of
Madura have furnished evidence that they are a progressive community,
particularly in the attention which they pay to education, and the
keenness with which they are on the look-out for improvements in the
methods of carrying out their hereditary craft. Nearly all the
so-called improvements have been tried at Madura, and the fact that
they have rejected most of them may be taken to some extent as evidence
of their unsuitability for Indian conditions. Some time ago, one A. A.
Kuppusawmy Iyer invented certain improvements in the native shedding
apparatus, whereby ornamental patterns are woven along the borders, and
on the ends of the better class of silk and cotton cloths. This
apparatus was undoubtedly a material improvement upon that which is
ordinarily used by the weaver, and it has been taken up extensively in
the town. It is said that there are 350 looms fitted with this shedding
apparatus, and the inventor, who has obtained a patent for it, is
trying to collect a royalty of Rs. 1&ndash;4&ndash;0 a month on each
loom. But this claim is resisted by a combination of the weavers using
this shedding apparatus, and a suit is at the present time (1907)
pending in the District Court. One of the most important weaving
enterprises at Madura is the Meenakshi Weaving Company, the partners of
which are Ramachandra Iyer, Muthurama <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>Iyer, and Kuppusawmy
Iyer. Their subscribed capital is Rs. 1,00,000, of which they are
spending no less than Rs. 40,000 on building a weaving shed and office.
The Madura dyeing industry is in the hands of the Saur&#257;shtras, and
the modern phase dates back only as far as 1895, when Mr. Tulsiram
started dyeing grey yarn with alizarine red, and, in the twelve years
which have since elapsed, the industry has grown to very large
proportions. The total sales at Madura average at present about 24
lakhs a year. There are from 30 to 40 dye-houses, and upwards of 5,000
cwt. of alizarine red is purchased every year from the Badische Aniline
Soda Fabrik. The yarn is purchased locally, mainly from the Madura
Mills, but, to some extent, also from Coimbatore and Tuticorin. The
mordanting is done entirely with crude native earths, containing a
large percentage of potassium salts. Drying the yarn presents
considerable difficulty, especially in the wet weather. To secure a
fast even colour, the yarn is mordanted about ten times, and dyed
twice, or for very superior work three times, and between each
operation it is essential that the yarn should be dried. The suburbs of
Madura are now almost entirely covered with drying yards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans who have settled in
Travancore, Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar writes as follows. &ldquo;The
Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans are generally of yellowish tinge, and in
possession of handsomer and more intellectual features than the Tamil
castes, from which they may be easily differentiated by even a casual
observer. They are, however, more fair than cleanly. They keep in
Travancore, as elsewhere, aloof from other castes, and live
independently of general society, speaking a foreign language. This
they have preserved with astonishing attachment, and recently a
Saur&#257;shtra alphabet has been invented, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>elementary books have begun to be written in
that dialect. They are a very conservative class, religious enthusiasts
of a very remarkable order, and skilful and industrious workmen. They
take a peculiar pleasure in music, and many of them are excellent
songsters. There are many kinds of amusement for both men and women,
who generally spend their leisure in singing songs of a devotional
nature. They believe largely in omens, of which the following may be
noted:&mdash;</p>
<p>Good.&mdash;A pot full of water, a burning light, no Br&#257;hmans,
a S&#363;dra, a cow, a married woman, and gold.</p>
<p>Bad.&mdash;A barber, a patient, a person with some bodily defect,
fuel, oil, a donkey, a pick-axe, a broom, and a fan.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Patn&#363;k&#257;ran marriage procession.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;On entering a Patn&#363;lk&#257;ran&rsquo;s house, we are led
to a courtyard, spacious and neat, where all the necessary arrangements
are made for weaving purposes. The Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans live in
streets. A male Patn&#363;lk&#257;ran resembles a Tamil Vaishnava
Br&#257;hman in outward appearance, but the women follow the custom of
the Telugu Br&#257;hmans alike in their costume and ornaments. Their
jewels exactly resemble those of the Telugu Br&#257;hman women, and
indicate a temporary residence of the caste in the Telugu country on
the way from Gujarat to Madura. There is a Tamil proverb to the effect
that, if a male Patn&#363;lk&#257;ran is seen without his wife, he will
be taken for a Vaishnava Br&#257;hman, whereas, in the case of the
T&#257;tan caste, a woman without her husband will be taken for an
Aiyangar. Children wear the k&#257;rai round the neck. Tattooing
prevails on a very large scale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans may be divided into three classes
on a religious basis, viz., (1) pure Vaishnavites, who wear the
vertical Vaishnavite mark, and call themselves <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>Vadakalas or northerners; (2) those who are
mainly Smartas; (3) Sankara Vaishnavas, who wear g&#333;pi (sandal
paste) as their sect-mark. It is to the last of these religious sects
that the Travancore Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans belong, though, in recent
times, a few Smartas have settled at Kottar. All these intermarry and
interdine, and the religious difference does not create a distinction
in the caste. The chief divinity of the Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans is
Venkat&#257;chalapati of Tirupati. The month in which he is most
worshipped is Kanni (September-October), and all the Saturdays and the
Tiruvonam star of the month are particularly devoted to his adoration.
One of their men becomes possessed on any of these days, and, holding a
burning torch-light in his hand, touches the foreheads of the assembled
devotees therewith. The Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans fast on those days, and
take an image of Garuda in procession through the street. The
D&#299;p&#257;vali, Pannamasi in Chittiray, and the Vaikuntha
&#274;k&#257;dasi are other important religious days. The Dusserah is
observed, as also are the festivals of Sr&#299; R&#257;ma Navami,
Ashtami, Rohini, Avani Avittam, and Vara Lakshmivratam. Formal worship
of deities is done by those who have obtained the requisite initiation
from a spiritual preceptor. Women who have husbands fast on full-moon
days, Mondays, and Fridays. The serpent and the banyan tree are
specially worshipped. Women sing songs in praise of Lakshmi, and offer
fruits and cocoanuts to her. The Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans have a temple
dedicated to Sr&#299; R&#257;ma at Kottar. This temple is visited even
by Br&#257;hmans, and the priests are Aiyangars. The Ach&#257;rya, or
supreme religious authority of the Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans, in
Travancore is a Vaishnava Br&#257;hman known as Ubhaya
V&#275;d&#257;nta K&#333;ti Kanyak&#257;d&#257;na
T&#257;t&#257;ch&#257;riyar, who lives at Aravankulam near Tinnevelly,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>and possesses a large number of disciples. Once
a year he visits his flock in Travancore, and is highly respected by
them, as also by the Mah&#257;raj&#257;, who makes a donation of money
to him. Elders are appointed to decide social disputes, and manage the
common property of the caste. In Travancore there are said to be only
three families of Patn&#363;lk&#257;ran priests. For the higher
ceremonies, Br&#257;hman priests are employed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl&rsquo;s marriage is usually celebrated before puberty,
and sometimes when she is a mere child of four or five. Great
importance is attached to g&#333;tras or exogamous septs, and it is
said that the septs of the bride and bridegroom are conspicuously
inscribed on the walls of a marriage house. In the selection of an
auspicious hour (muhurtam) for a marriage, two favourable planetary
situations, one closely following the other, are necessary; and, as
such occasions are rare, a number of marriages take place at one time.
A man may claim his maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter as his wife, and
polygamy is permitted. The marriage ceremonial resembles the
Br&#257;hmanical rites in many points. On the fourth day, a ceremonial
observed by Telugu Br&#257;hmans, called N&#257;gabali, is performed.
The marriage badge, which is tied on the bride&rsquo;s neck, is called
bottu. [From a note on the marriage ceremonies among the
Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans of Madura, I gather that, as among Telugu and
Canarese castes, a number of pots are arranged, and worshipped. These
pots are smaller and fewer in number than at a Telugu or Canarese
wedding. A figure of a car is drawn on the wall of the house with red
earth or laterite.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2396src" href=
"#xd21e2396" name="xd21e2396src">88</a> On it the name of the
g&#333;tra of the bridegroom is written. On the fourth day, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>n&#257;gavali (or offering to D&#275;vas) is
performed. The contracting couple sit near the pots, and a number of
lights are arranged on the floor. The pots, which represent the
D&#275;vas, are worshipped.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;The n&#257;makarana, or name-giving ceremony, is performed on
the eleventh day after birth. An eighth child, whether male or female,
is called Krishna, owing to the tradition that Krishna was born as the
eighth child of Vasud&#275;va. Babies are affectionately called Duddu
(milk) or Pilla (child). The annapr&#257;sana, or first feeding of the
child, is sometimes celebrated at the end of the first year, but
usually as a preliminary to some subsequent ceremony. Sometimes, in
performance of a vow, boys are taken to the shrine at Tirupati for the
tonsure ceremony. The upanayana is performed between the seventh and
twelfth years, but neither br&#257;hmacharya nor sam&#257;vartana is
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dead are burnt, and the remains of the bones are
collected and deposited under water. Death pollution lasts only for ten
days. The sr&#257;dh, or annual ceremony, when oblations are offered to
ancestors, is observed. Widows are allowed to retain their hair, but
remove the bottu. Unlike Br&#257;hman women, they chew betel, and wear
coloured cloths, even in old age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans have a secret trade language, concerning
which Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao writes as follows. &ldquo;The most
remarkable feature about it is the number of terms and phrases borrowed
from the craft, to which special meanings are given. Thus a man of no
status is stigmatised as a rikhta khandu, <i>i.e.</i>, a spindle
without the yarn. Similarly, a man of little sense is called a mhudha,
the name of a thick peg which holds one side of the roller. Likewise, a
talkative person is referred to as a rhetta, or roller used for winding
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>thread upon spindles, which makes a most
unpleasant creaking noise. Kapinik&#275;r, from kapini, a technical
term used for cutting the loom off, means to make short work of an
undesirable person. A man who is past middle age is called porkut
phillias, which, in weavers&rsquo; parlance, means that half the loom
is turned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2414width" id="pl6-177"><img src=

</div>
<p><b>Patr&#257;.&mdash;</b>The Patr&#257;s are an Oriya caste, which
is divided into two sections, one of which is engaged in the
manufacture of silk (pata) waist-threads, tassels, etc., and the other
in weaving silk cloths. The members of the two sections do not
interdine. The former have exogamous septs or bamsams, the names of
which are also used as titles, <i>e.g.</i>, S&#257;hu, P&#257;tro, and
Prushti. The latter have exogamous septs, such as Tenga, Jaggali,
Telaga, and Mah&#257;n&#257;yako, and B&#275;hara and N&#257;yako as
titles. The chief headman of the cloth-weaving section is called
Mah&#257;n&#257;yako, and there are other officers called B&#275;hara
and Bhollobaya. The headman of the other section is called
S&#275;n&#257;pati, and he is assisted by a Dhanapati. Infant marriage
is the rule, and, if a girl does not secure a husband before she
reaches maturity, she must, if she belongs to the cloth-weaving
section, go through a form of marriage with an old man, and, if to the
other section, with an arrow.</p>
<p>The Telugu Patr&#257;s are summed up, in the Madras Census Report,
1901, as &ldquo;a Telugu caste of hunters and cultivators, found
chiefly in the districts of Cuddapah and Kurnool. It has two divisions,
the Doras (chiefs), and Gurikalas (marksmen), the former of which is
supposed to be descended from the old Poligars (feudal chiefs), and the
latter from their followers and servants. This theory is supported by
the fact that, at the weddings of Gurikalas, the Doras receive the
first p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri (betel leaf and areca nut). Widows may not
remarry, nor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>is divorce recognised. They usually employ
Br&#257;hmans at marriages, and S&#257;t&#257;nis at funerals. Though
they are Vaishnavites, they also worship village deities, such as
Gangamma and Ellamma. They bury their dead, and perform annual
sr&#257;ddhas (memorial services for the dead). They will eat with
Gollas. Their title is Naidu.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>P&#257;tram&#275;la.&mdash;</b>P&#257;tram&#275;la, or
P&#257;trad&#275;va, is the name of a class of dancing girls in South
Canara. P&#257;tram&#275;la, Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2433src" href="#xd21e2433" name="xd21e2433src">89</a> is the
name by which the Konkani Kal&#257;vants (courtezans) are known above
the ghauts.</p>
<p><b>P&#257;tro.&mdash;</b>The title of the head of a group of
villages in Ganjam, and also recorded, at times of census, as a title
of Alia, K&#257;linga K&#333;mati, Dolai, and Jaggala. The conferring
of a cloth (s&#257;dhi) on a P&#257;tro is said to be emblematic of
conferring an estate. The P&#257;tro, among other perquisites, is
entitled to a fee on occasions of marriage. I am informed that, in the
Ganjam M&#257;liahs, if a Kondh was unable to pay the fee, he met his
love at night beneath two trysting trees, and retired with her into the
jungle for three days and nights.</p>
<p><b>P&#257;trudu.&mdash;</b>The title, meaning those who are fit to
receive a gift, of Aiyarakulu and Nagar&#257;lu.</p>
<p><b>P&#257;ttadhik&#257;ri.&mdash;</b>A class of Jangams, who have
settled head-quarters.</p>
<p><b>Pattan.&mdash;</b>The equivalent of the Br&#257;hman Bhatta. A
name by which some Kamm&#257;lans, especially goldsmiths, style
themselves.</p>
<p><b>Pattanavada.&mdash;</b>A synonym for the Mog&#275;r fishing
caste, the settlements of which are called pattana.</p>
<p><b>Pattanavan.&mdash;</b>The fishermen on the east coast, from the
Kistna to the Tanjore district, are popularly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>called Karaiy&#257;n, or sea-shore people. Some
Karaiy&#257;ns have, at times of census, returned themselves as Taccha
(carpenter) Karaiy&#257;ns.</p>
<p>Pattanavan means literally a dweller in a town or pattanam, which
word occurs in the names of various towns on the sea-coast,
<i>e.g.</i>, N&#257;gapattanam (Negapatam), Chennapattanam (Madras).
The Pattanavans have two main divisions, Periya (big) and Chinna
(small), and, in some places, for example, at Nadukuppam in the Nellore
district, exogamous septs, <i>e.g.</i>, Gengananga, P&#275;yananga,
Kathananga (children of Ganga, P&#275;yan, and Kathanar), and
Kullananga (children of dwarfs). In the Telugu country, they go by the
name of Pattapu or T&#363;liv&#257;ndlu.</p>
<p>Some Pattanavans give themselves high-sounding caste titles,
<i>e.g.</i>, &#256;riyar, Ayyayiraththalaivar (the five thousand
chiefs), &#256;riya N&#257;ttu Chetti (Chettis of the Ariyar country),
Acchu Vell&#257;la, Karaiturai (sea-coast) Vell&#257;la, Varunakula
Vell&#257;la or Varunakula Mudali after Varuna, the god of the waters,
or Kurukula vamsam after Kuru, the ancestor of the Kauravas. Some
Pattanavans have adopted the title Pillai.</p>
<p>The Pattanavans are said to be inferior to the Sembadavans, who will
not accept food at their hands, and discard even an earthen pot which
has been touched by a Pattanavan.</p>
<p>Concerning the origin of the caste, there is a legend that the
Pattanavans were giving silk thread to Siva, and were hence called
Pattanavar, a corruption of Pattanaivor, meaning knitters of silk
thread. They were at the time all bachelors, and Siva suggested the
following method of securing wives for them. They were told to go out
fishing in the sea, and make of their catch as many heaps as there were
bachelors. Each of them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href=
"#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>then stood before a heap, and
called for a wife, who was created therefrom. According to another
story, some five thousand years ago, during the age of the lunar race,
there was one Dasa R&#257;ja, who was ruling near Hastin&#257;pura, and
was childless. To secure offspring, he prayed to god, and did severe
penance. In answer to his prayer, God pointed out a tank full of lotus
flowers, and told the king to go thither, and call for children.
Thereon, five thousand children issued forth from the flowers, to the
eldest of whom the king bequeathed his kingdom, and to the others money
in abundance. Those who received the money travelled southward in
ships, which were wrecked, and they were cast ashore. This compelled
them to make friends of local sea fishermen, whose profession they
adopted. At the present day, the majority of Pattanavans are
sea-fishermen, and catch fish with nets from catamarans.
&ldquo;Fancy,&rdquo; it has been written,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2482src" href="#xd21e2482" name="xd21e2482src">90</a> &ldquo;a
raft of only three logs of wood, tied together at each end when they go
out to sea, and untied and left to dry on the beach when they come in
again. Each catamaran has one, two or three men to manage it; they sit
crouched on it upon their heels, throwing their paddles about very
dexterously, but remarkably unlike rowing. In one of the early Indian
voyager&rsquo;s log-books there is an entry concerning a catamaran:
&lsquo;This morning, 6 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, saw distinctly two
black devils playing at single stick. We watched these infernal imps
about an hour, when they were lost in the distance. Surely this doth
portend some great tempest.&rsquo; It is very curious to watch these
catamarans putting out to sea. They get through the fiercest surf,
sometimes dancing at their ease on the top of the waters, sometimes
hidden under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>the waters; sometimes the man completely washed
off his catamaran, and man floating one way and catamaran another, till
they seem to catch each other again by magic.&rdquo; In 1906, a
fisherman was going out in his catamaran to fish outside the Madras
harbour, and was washed off his craft, and dashed violently against a
rock. Death was instantaneous. Of the catamaran, the following account
is given by Colonel W. Campbell.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2490src"
href="#xd21e2490" name="xd21e2490src">91</a> &ldquo;Of all the
extraordinary craft which the ingenuity of man has ever invented, a
Madras catamaran is the most extraordinary, the most simple, and yet,
in proper hands, the most efficient. It is merely three rough logs of
wood, firmly lashed together with ropes formed from the inner bark of
the cocoanut tree. Upon this one, two, or three men, according to the
size of the catamaran, sit on their heels in a kneeling posture, and,
defying wind and weather, make their way through the raging surf which
beats upon the coast, and paddle out to sea at times when no other
craft can venture to face it. At a little distance, the slight fabric
on which these adventurous mariners float becomes invisible, and a
fleet of them approaching the land presents the absurd appearance of a
host of savage-looking natives wading out towards the ship, up to their

&ldquo;is two logs of wood lashed together, forming a very small and
narrow raft. The rower wears a &lsquo;fool&rsquo;s cap,&rsquo; in which
he carries letters (also betel and tobacco), and, when he encounters a
big wave, he leaves his boat, slips through the wave himself, and picks
up his catamaran on the other side of it. Some very large deep barges
(mas&#363;la boats), the planks of which are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>sewn
together to give elasticity, and the interstices stuffed with straw,
came out for us, with a guard of honour of the mosquito fleet, as the
catamarans are called, on either side of them; two of the fool&rsquo;s
cap men, and a flag as big as the boat itself, on each one.&rdquo; The
present day mas&#363;la or mussoola boat, or surf boat of the
Coromandel Coast, is of the same build as several centuries ago. It is
recorded,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2499src" href="#xd21e2499" name=
"xd21e2499src">93</a> in 1673, that &ldquo;I went ashore in a Mussoola,
a boat wherein ten men paddle, the two aftermost of whom are the
Steers-men, using their Paddles instead of a Rudder: The Boat is not
strengthened with knee-timber, as ours are; the bended Planks are sowed
together with Rope-yarn of the Cocoe, and calked with Dammar so
artificially that it yields to every ambitious surf. Otherwise we could
not get ashore, the Bar knocking in pieces all that are
inflexible.&rdquo; The old records of Madras contain repeated
references to Europeans being drowned from overturning of <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e2502" title="Source: masula">mas&#363;la</span> boats
in the surf, through which a landing had to be effected before the
harbour was built.</p>
<p>In 1907, two Madras fishermen were invested with silver wrist
bangles, bearing a suitable inscription, which were awarded by the
Government in recognition of their bravery in saving the lives of a
number of boatmen during a squall in the harbour.</p>

<p>The Pattanavans are Saivites, but also worship various minor gods
and Gr&#257;ma D&#275;vatas (village deities). In some places, they
regard Kuttiy&#257;ndavan as their special sea god. To him animal
sacrifices are not made, but goats are sacrificed to Sembu
V&#299;rappan or M&#299;nnodum Pillai, an attendant on
Kuttiy&#257;ndavan. In Tanjore, the names of the sea gods are
P&#257;vadair&#257;yan and Padaithalaidaivam. Before setting out on a
fishing expedition, the Pattanavans salute the god, the sea, and the
nets. In the Tanjore district, they repair their nets once in eight
days, and, before they go out fishing, pray to their gods to favour
them with a big catch. On a fixed day, they make offerings to the gods
on their return from fishing. The gods P&#257;vadair&#257;yan and
Padaithalaidaivam are represented by large conical heaps of wet sand
and mud, and Ayyanar, Ellamma, Kuttiy&#257;ndavar, Muthy&#257;lrouthar
and Kiliy&#275;ndhi by smaller heaps. At the M&#257;simakam festival,
the Pattanavans worship their gods on the sea-shore. The names
J&#257;ttan and J&#257;tti are given to children during the J&#257;tre
or periodic festival of the village goddesses. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Pattanavans afford a good example of a caste, in which the
time-honoured village council (panch&#257;yat) is no empty, powerless
body. For every settlement or village there are one or more headmen
called Yejam&#257;nan, who are assisted by a Thandak&#257;ran and a
Paraiyan Chalav&#257;thi. All these offices are hereditary. Questions
connected with the community, such as disrespect to elders, breach of
social etiquette, insult, abuse, assault, adultery, or drinking or
eating with men of lower caste, are enquired into by the council. Even
when disputes are settled in courts of law, they must come before the
council. Within the community, the headman is all powerful, and his
decision is, in most instances, considered final. If, however, his
verdict is not regarded as equitable, the case is referred to a caste
headman, who holds sway over a group of villages. No ceremony may be
performed without the sanction of the local headman, and the details of
ceremonies, except the feasting, are arranged by the headman and the
Thandak&#257;ran. In the case of a proposed marriage, the match is
broken off if the headman objects to it. He should be present at the
funeral rites, and see that the details thereof are properly carried
out. It is the duty of the Chalav&#257;thi to convey the news of a
death to the relations. Should he come to the shore when the fishes are
heaped up, he has the right to take a few thereof as his perquisite.
The Thandak&#257;ran, among other duties, has to summon council
meetings. When the members of council have assembled, he ushers in the
parties who have to appear before it, and salutes the assembly by
prostrating himself on the floor. The parties take a bit of straw, or
other object, and place it before the headman in token that they are
willing to abide by the decision of the council. This formality is
called placing the agreement (muchchilika). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>The consent of the maternal uncles is necessary before a pair can be
united in matrimony. When the wedding day has been fixed, the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party distribute gr&#257;ma th&#257;mb&#363;lam
(village p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri or betel) to the headman and villagers.
The marriage milk-post is made of <i>Mimusops hexandra</i>,
<i>Erythrina indica</i>, <i>Casuarina equisetifolia</i>, the green wood
of some other tree, or even a pestle. In one form of the marriage
ceremony, which varies in detail according to locality, the bridegroom,
on the arrival of the bride at the pandal (booth), puts on the sacred
thread, and the Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit makes the sacred fire, and
pours gh&#299; (clarified butter) into it. The bridegroom ties the
t&#257;li round the bride&rsquo;s neck, and the maternal uncles tie
flat silver or gold plates, called pattam, on the foreheads of the
contracting couple. Rings are put on their second toes by the
brother-in-law of the bridegroom and the maternal uncle of the bride.
Towards evening, the sacred thread, the threads which have been tied to
the marriage pots and the milk-post, and grain seedlings used at the
ceremony, are thrown into the sea. Some Pattanavans allow a couple to
live together as man and wife after the betrothal, but before the
marriage ceremony. This is, however, on condition that the latter is
performed as soon as it is convenient. The remarriage of widows is
freely permitted. No marriage pandal is erected, and the bridegroom, or
a female relation, ties the t&#257;li on the bride&rsquo;s neck within
the house. Such marriage is, therefore, called naduv&#299;ttu (interior
of the house) t&#257;li. When a woman, who has been guilty of adultery,
is remarried, a turmeric string is substituted for the golden
t&#257;li, and is tied on the bride&rsquo;s neck by a woman.</p>

<p>Some Pattanavans have adopted the custom of burying their dead in a
seated posture (samathi). If a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186"
href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>corpse is cremated, fire is
carried to the burning-ground by a barber. When the corpse has been
laid on the pyre, rice is thrown over it. The son, accompanied by a
barber and a Panisavan or washerman, and carrying a pot of water on his
shoulder, goes thrice round the pyre. At the third round, the Panisavan
or washerman makes holes in the pot, and it is thrown away. On the day
of the funeral, all the agnates shave their heads. On the following
day, they go to the burial or burning ground with tender cocoanuts,
milk, cakes, etc., and Arichandra, who presides over the burial-ground,
is worshipped. Milk is then poured over the grave, or the remains of
the bones, which are thrown into the sea. On the night of the fifteenth
day, Panisavans blow the conch and horn, and red cloths are presented
to the widow of the deceased by her relations. At about 4 <span class=
"sc">A.M.</span>, a white cloth is thrown on her neck, and the
t&#257;li string is cut by an old woman. The t&#257;li is removed
therefrom, and dropped into a new pot filled with water. Hence, a form
of abuse among Pattanavan women is, May your t&#257;li be snapped, and
thrown into water. The t&#257;li is removed from the pot, which is
thrown into the sea. The t&#257;li is laid on a dish containing milk,
and all those who visit the widow must set eyes on it before they see
her.</p>
<p>In the city of Madras, the Pattanavans have the privilege of
supplying bearers at temples, and the atmosphere surrounding them as
they carry the idols on their sturdy shoulders through Triplicane is
said to be &ldquo;redolent of brine and the toddy shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a judgment of the High Court of Judicature, Madras, it is
recorded that, in the eighteenth century, some boat-owners and boatmen
belonging to the Curukula Vamsha or Varunakula Mudali caste, who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>were residing at Chepauk in the city of Madras,
had embraced Christianity, and worshipped in a chapel, which had been
erected by voluntary contributions. In 1799 the site of their village
was required for public purposes, and they obtained in lieu of it a
grant of land at Royapuram, where a chapel was built. Partly by taxes
levied on boatmen, and partly by tolls they were allowed to impose on
persons for frequenting the Royapuram bazar, a fund was formed to
provide for their spiritual wants, and this fund was administered by
the Marine Board. In 1829, a portion of the fund was expended in the
erection of the church of St. Peter, Royapuram, and the fund was
transferred to Government. The administration of the fund has been the
source of litigation in the High Court.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>It is noted by Mrs. F. E. Penny that some of the fisherfolk
&ldquo;adopted Xavier as their special patron saint, and, as time
passed, almost deified him. In the present day, they appeal to him in
times of danger, crying &lsquo;Xavier! Xavier! Xavier!&rsquo; in storm
and peril. Even if they are unfortunate in their catch when fishing,
they turn to their saint for succour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a numismatist, I resent the practice resorted to by some
fishermen of melting old lead coins, and converting them into sinkers
for their nets.</p>

H. A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2680src" href="#xd21e2680"
name="xd21e2680src">95</a> as &ldquo;a Canarese caste of silk weavers.
They are Hindus, and worship both Siva and Vishnu, but their special
deity is Durga Param&#275;svari at Bark&#363;r. They wear the sacred
thread, and employ Br&#257;hmans for ceremonial purposes. They are
governed by a body called the ten men, and pay allegiance to the guru
of the R&#257;machandra math (religious institution). They are divided
into balis (septs) and a man may not marry within his own bali.
Polygamy is allowed only when a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189"
href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>wife is barren, or suffers
from some incurable disease, such as leprosy. The girls are married in
infancy, and the binding portion of the ceremony is called dh&#257;re
(<i>see</i> Bant). Widow marriage is not permitted, and divorce is only
allowed in the case of an adulterous wife. They follow the ordinary
Hindu law of inheritance. The dead are cremated. The sr&#257;dha
(memorial) ceremony is in use, and the Mah&#257;laya ceremony for the
propitiation of ancestors in general is performed annually. Female
ancestors are also worshipped every year at a ceremony called vaddap,
when meals are given to married women. They eat fish but not meat, and
the use of alcohol is not permitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Mysore Census Report, 1891, the Patv&#275;g&#257;rs are
described as &ldquo;silk weavers who speak a corrupt Mar&#257;thi
conglomerate of Guzar&#257;ti and Hindi. They worship all the Hindu
deities, especially the female energy under the name of S&#257;kti, to
which a goat is sacrificed on the night of the Dasara festival, a
Musalman slaughtering the animal. After the sacrifice, the family of
the Patv&#275;g&#257;r partake of the flesh. Many of their females are
naturally fair and handsome, but lose their beauty from early marriage
and precocity.&rdquo; A few Patt&#275;g&#257;ras, who speak a corrupt
form of Mar&#257;thi, are to be found in the Anantapur district.</p>

<p><b>Penn&#275;g&#257;ra.&mdash;</b>Konkani-speaking rice-beaters in

<p><b>Pentiya.&mdash;</b>The Pentiyas also call themselves Holuva and
Halab&#257; or Halb&#257;. In the Madras Census Report, 1901, they are
called Pantia as well as Pentiya, and described as Oriya betel-leaf
(panno) sellers. Their occupation, in the Jeypore Agency tracts, is
that of cultivators. According to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao, to whom I am
indebted for the following note, numbers of them migrated thither from
Bustar, and settled at Pentikonna, and are hence called Pentikonaya or
Pentiya. Their language is Halba, which is easily understood by those
who speak Oriya. They are divided into two endogamous sections, called
Bodo (big or genuine), and Sanno (little), of whom the latter are said
to be illegitimate descendants of the former. The Bodos are further
sub-divided into a series of septs, <i>e.g.</i>, Kurum (tortoise),
Bh&#257;g (tiger), N&#257;g (cobra), and S&#363;rya (sun). The caste is
highly organized, and the head of a local centre is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>called Bhatha N&#257;yako. He is assisted by a
Pradh&#257;ni, an Umriya N&#257;yako, and Dol&#257;yi. The caste
messenger is called Chol&#257;no, and he carries a silver baton when he
summons the castemen to a meeting. An elaborate ceremony is performed
when a person, who has been tried by the caste council, is to be
received back into the caste. He is accompanied to the bank of a
stream, where his tongue is burnt with a gold or silver wire or
ornament by the Bhatha N&#257;yako, and some offerings from the
Jagann&#257;tha temple at P&#363;ri are given to him. He is then taken
home, and provides a feast, at which the N&#257;yako has the privilege
of eating first. He has further to make a present of cloths to the
assembled elders, and the four heads of the caste receive a larger
quantity than the others. The feast over, he is again taken, carrying
some cooked rice, to the stream, and with it pushed therein. This
ceremonial bath frees him from pollution.</p>
<p>Girls are married either before or after puberty. A man can claim
his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter in marriage. The bridegroom&rsquo;s
party proceed, with the bridegroom, to the bride&rsquo;s village, and
take up their abode in a separate house. They then take three cloths
for the bride&rsquo;s mother, three rupees for her father, and a cloth
and two annas for each of her brothers, and present them together with
rice, liquor, and other articles. Pandals (booths) are erected in front
of the quarters of the bridal couple, that of the bridegroom being made
of nine, and that of the bride of five s&#257;l (<i>Shorea robusta</i>)
poles, to which a pot containing myrabolams (<i>Terminalia</i> fruits)
and rice is tied. The couple bathe, and the bridegroom proceeds to the
house of the bride. The D&#275;s&#257;ri, who officiates, dons the
sacred thread, and divides the pandal into two by means of a screen or
curtain. The couple <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192"
name="pb192">192</a>]</span>go seven times round the pandal, and the
screen is removed. They then enter the pandal, and the D&#275;s&#257;ri
links their little fingers together. The day&rsquo;s ceremony concludes
with a feast. On the following day, the bride is conducted to the house
of the bridegroom, and they sprinkle each other with turmeric water.
They then bathe in a stream or river. Another feast is held, with much
drinking, and is followed by a wild dance. The remarriage of widows is
permitted, and a younger brother may marry the widow of his elder
brother. The dead are burnt, and death pollution is observed for ten
days, during which the relatives of the deceased are fed by members of
another sept. On the tenth day a caste feast takes place.</p>
<p>The Pentiyas are said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2776src" href=
"#xd21e2776" name="xd21e2776src">96</a> to distribute rice, and other
things, to Br&#257;hmans, once a year on the new-moon day in the month
of Bh&#257;drapadam (September-October), and to worship a female deity
named K&#257;milli on Saturdays. No one, I am informed, other, I
presume, than a Pentiya, would take anything from a house where she is
worshipped, lest the goddess should accompany him, and require him to
become her devotee.</p>
<p>The caste title is N&#257;yako.</p>
<p><b>Peraka</b> (tile).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
D&#275;v&#257;nga.</p>
<p><b>Perike.&mdash;</b>This word is defined, in the Madras Census
Report, 1901, as meaning literally a gunny bag, and the Perikes are
summed up as being a Telugu caste of gunny bag (goni) weavers,
corresponding to the Janappans of the Tamil districts. Gunny bag is the
popular and trading name of the coarse sacking and sacks made from the
fibre of jute, much used in Indian trade. It is noted, in the Census
Report, 1891, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193"
name="pb193">193</a>]</span>&ldquo;the Perikes claim to be a separate
caste, but they seem to be in reality a sub-division, and not a very
exalted sub-division, of Balijas, being in fact identical with the Uppu
(salt) Balijas. Their hereditary occupation is carrying salt, grain,
etc., on bullocks and donkeys in perikes or packs. Perike is found
among the sub-divisions of both Kavarai and Balija. Some of them,
however, have attained considerable wealth, and now claim to be
Kshatriyas, saying that they are the descendants of the Kshatriyas who
ran away (piriki, a coward) from the persecution of Parasur&#257;ma.
Others again say they are Kshatriyas who went into retirement, and made
hills (giri) their abode (puri).&rdquo; These Perike
&lsquo;Kshatriyas&rsquo; are known as Puragiri Kshatriya and Giri
R&#257;zu. The Periki Balijas are described, in the Vizagapatam Manual,
as chiefly carrying on cultivation and trade, and some of them are said
to hold a high position at &lsquo;the Presidency&rsquo; (Madras) and in
the Vizagapatam district.</p>
<p>Perike women appear to have frequently committed sati (or suttee) on
the death of their husbands in former days, and the names of those who
thus sacrificed their lives are still held in reverence. A peculiar
custom among the Perikes is the erection of big square structures
(brind&#257;vanam), in which a tulsi (<i>Ocimum sanctum</i>) is
planted, on the spot where the ashes of the dead are buried after
cremation. I am informed that a fine series of these structures may be
seen at Ch&#299;purapalli, close to Vizianagram. As a mark of respect
to the dead, passers-by usually place a lac bangle or flowers thereon.
The usual titles of the Perikes are Anna and Ayya, but some style
themselves Rao (= R&#257;ya, king) or R&#257;yadu, in reference to
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2797" title="Source: fheir">their</span>
alleged Kshatriya origin. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href=
"#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span></p>
<p>For the following note on the Perikes of the God&#257;vari district,
I am indebted to Mr. F. R. Hemingway. &ldquo;Like some of the Kammas,
they claim to be of Kshatriya stock, and say they are of the lineage of
Parasu R&#257;ma, but were driven out by him for kidnapping his sister,
while pretending to be gunny-bag weavers. They say that they were
brought to this country by king Nala of the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, in
gratitude for their having taken care of his wife Damayanti when he
quitted her during his misfortunes. They support the begging caste of
Varugu Bhattas, who, they say, supported them during their exile, and
to whom they gave a sanad (deed of grant) authorising them to demand
alms. These people go round the Perike houses for their dues every
year. The P&#299;su Perikes, who still weave gunny-bags, are said not
to belong to the caste proper, members of which style themselves
R&#257;cha Perikes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Perikes say that, like the K&#333;matis, they have 101
g&#333;tras. Their marriage ceremonies are peculiar. On the day of the
wedding, the bride and bridegroom are made to fast, as also are three
male relatives, whom they call suribhaktas. At the marriage, the couple
sit on a gunny-bag, and another gunny, on which a representation of the
god Mailar is drawn or painted, is spread between them. The same god is
drawn on two pots, and these, and also a third pot, are filled with
rice and dh&#257;l (<i>Cajanus indicus</i>), which are cooked by two
married women. The food is then offered to Mailar. Next, the three
suribhaktas take 101 cotton threads, fasten them together, and tie
seven knots in them. The bride and bridegroom are given cloths which
have been partly immersed in water coloured with turmeric and chunam
(lime), and the suribhaktas are fed with the rice and dh&#257;l cooked
in the pots. The couple are then taken round <span class=

village in procession, and, on their return, the knotted cotton threads
are tied round the bride&rsquo;s neck instead of a t&#257;li.</p>

company of merchants or travellers.</p>

href="#n199.1" name="n199.1src">97</a> as being, in the Telugu country,
a class of mendicants, who are herbalists, and physic people for fever,

<p>The Picchai or Pinchikuntar are described in the Salem Manual as
&ldquo;servants to the Kudi&#257;navars or cultivators&mdash;a name
commonly assumed by Vell&#257;las and Pallis. The story goes that a
certain Vell&#257;la had a hundred and two children, of whom only one
was a female. Of the males, one was lame, and his hundred brothers made
a rule that one would provide him with one kolagam of grain and one
fanam (a coin) each year. They got him married to a Telugu woman of a
different caste, and the musicians who attended the ceremony were paid
nothing, the brothers alleging that, as the bridegroom was a cripple,
the musicians should officiate from charitable motives. The descendants
of this married pair, having no caste of their own, became known as
Picchi or Pinchikuntars (beggars, or lame). They are treated as
kudipinnai (inferior) by Vell&#257;las, and to the present day receive
their prescribed miras (fee) from the Vell&#257;la descendants of the
hundred brothers, to whom, on marriage and other festivals, they do
service by relating the genealogies of such Vell&#257;las as they are
acquainted with. Some serve the Vell&#257;las in the fields, and others
live by begging.&rdquo;<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n199.1">97</a>

and are worshippers of Bhadrak&#257;li or of Sakti. The name is also
applied to snake-catchers, and it was probably conferred on the caste
owing to the snake being an emblem of the human passion embodied in the
deities they worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Pilapalli.&mdash;</b>The Pilapallis are a small caste or
community in Travancore, concerning which Mr. S. Subramanya Aiyar
writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2884src" href=
"#xd21e2884" name="xd21e2884src">99</a> &ldquo;The following sketch
will show what trifling circumstances are sufficient in this land of
Parasur&#257;ma to call a new caste into existence. The word Pilapally
is supposed to be a corruption of Bel&#257;l Thalli, meaning forcibly
ejected. It therefore contains, as though in a nutshell, the history of
the origin of this little community, which it is used to designate. In
the palmy days of the Chempakasseri R&#257;jas, about the year 858
M.E., there lived at the court of the then ruling Prince at
Ambalappuzha a Namb&#363;ri Br&#257;hman who stood high in the
Prince&rsquo;s favour, and who therefore became an eye-sore to all his
fellow courtiers. The envy and hatred of the latter grew to such a
degree that one day they put their heads together to devise a plan
which should at once strip him of all influence at court, and humble
him in the eyes of the public. The device hit upon was a strange one,
and characteristic of that dim and distant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>past. The Namb&#363;ri was the custodian of all
presents made to the Prince, and as such it was a part of his daily
work to arrange the articles presented in their proper places. It was
arranged that one day a dead fish, beautifully tied up and covered,
should be placed among the presents laid before the Prince. The victim
of the plot, little suspecting there was treachery in the air, removed
all the presents as usual with his own hand. His enemies at court, who
were but waiting for an opportunity of humbling him to the dust,
thereupon caused the bundle to be examined before the Prince, when it
became evident that it contained a dead fish. Now, for a Namb&#363;ri
to handle a dead fish was, according to custom, sufficient to make him
lose caste. On the strength of this argument, the Prince, who was
himself a Br&#257;hmin, was easily prevailed upon to put the
Namb&#363;ri out of the pale of caste, and the court favourite was
immediately excommunicated. There is another and a slightly different
version of the story, according to which the Namb&#363;ri in question
was the hereditary priest of the royal house, to whom fell the duty of
removing and preserving the gifts. In course of time he grew so
arrogant that the Prince himself wanted to get rid of him, but, the
office of the priest being hereditary, he did not find an easy way of
accomplishing his cherished object, and, after long deliberation with
those at court in whom he could confide, came at last to the solution
narrated above. It is this forcible ejection that the expression
Bel&#257;l Thalli (afterwards changed into Pilapally) is said to
import.... It appears that the unfortunate Namb&#363;ri had two wives,
both of whom elected to share his fate. Accordingly, the family
repaired to Parav&#363;r, a village near Kallarkode, where their royal
patron made them a gift of land. Although they quitted Ambalapuzha
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>for good, they seem to have long owned there a
madathummuri (a room in a series, in which Br&#257;hmins from abroad
once lived and traded), and are said to be still entitled daily to a
measure of p&#257;lpayasom from the temple, a sweet pudding of milk,
rice and sugar, celebrated all over Malabar for its excellence. The
progeny of the family now count in all about ninety members, who live
in eight or nine different houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Pillai.&mdash;</b>Pillai, meaning child, is in the Tamil country
primarily the title of Vell&#257;las, but has, at recent times of
census, been returned as the title of a number of classes, which
include Agamudaiyan, Ambalak&#257;ran, Golla, Idaiyan, N&#257;yar,
N&#333;kkan, Panisavan, Panikkan, Paraiyan, Saiyakk&#257;ran,
Sembadavan and S&#275;naikkudaiy&#257;ns. Pilla is further used as the
title of the male offspring of D&#275;va-d&#257;sis. Many Paraiyan
butlers of Europeans have assumed the title Pillai as an honorific
suffix to their name. So, too, have some criminal Koravas, who pose as
Vell&#257;las.</p>

than two thousand were returned in the same year as being engaged in
agriculture and Government service. The Pind&#257;ris were formerly
celebrated as a notorious class of freebooters, who, in the seventeenth
century, attached themselves to the Mar&#257;thas in their revolt
against Aurangz&#299;b, and for a long <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

committed raids in all directions, extending their operations to

coast extending from Masulipatam northward, the Pind&#257;ris in ten

<p><b>Pish&#257;rati.&mdash;</b>The Pish&#257;ratis or Pish&#257;rodis
are summed up in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as being a sub-caste
of Ambalav&#257;sis, which makes flower garlands, and does menial
service in the temples. As regards their origin, the legend runs to the
effect that a Sw&#257;miyar, or Br&#257;hman ascetic, once had a
disciple of the same caste, who wished to become a Sany&#257;si or
anchorite. All the ceremonies prior to shaving the head of the novice
were completed, when, alarmed at the prospect of a cheerless life and
the severe austerities incidental thereto, he made himself scarce.
Pish&#257;ra denotes a Sany&#257;si&rsquo;s pupil, and as he, after
running away, was called Pish&#257;r&#333;di, the children born to him
of a Parasava woman by a subsequent marriage were called
Pish&#257;ratis. In his &lsquo;Early Sovereigns of Travancore,&rsquo;
Mr. Sundaram Pillay says that the Pish&#257;rati&rsquo;s
&ldquo;puzzling position among the Malabar castes, half monk and half
layman, is far from being accounted for by the silly and fanciful
modern derivation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201"
name="pb201">201</a>]</span>of Pish&#257;rakal plus Odi,
Pish&#257;rakal being more mysterious than Pish&#257;rati
itself.&rdquo; It is suggested by him that Pish&#257;rati is a
corruption of Bhatt&#257;raka-tiruvadi. According to the Jati-nirnaya,
the Bhatt&#257;rakas are a community degraded from the Br&#257;hmans
during the Tr&#275;t&#257; Y&#363;ga. As far as we are able to gather
from medi&aelig;val Travancore inscriptions, an officer known as
Pidara-tiruvadi was attached to every temple. It is known that he used
to receive large perquisites for temple service, and that extensive
rice-lands were given to the Bhattakara of Nelliyur. It is noted, in
the Gazetteer of Malabar, that &ldquo;the traditional etymology of the
name Pish&#257;rodi refers it to a Sany&#257;si novice, who, deterred
by the prospects of the hardship of life on which he was about to
enter, ran away (odi) at the last moment, after he had been divested of
the p&#363;n&#363;l (thread), but before he had performed the final
ceremony of plunging thrice in a tank (pond), and of plucking out, one
at each plunge, the last three hairs of his kudumi (the rest of which
had been shaved off). But the termination &lsquo;Odi&rsquo; is found in
other caste titles such as Adiy&#333;di and Vall&#333;di, and the
definition is obviously fanciful, while it does not explain the meaning
of Pish&#257;r.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The houses of Pish&#257;ratis are called pish&#257;ram. Their
primary occupation is to prepare garlands of flowers for Vaishnava
temples, but they frequently undertake the talikazhakam or sweeping
service in temples. Being learned men, and good Sanskrit scholars, they
are employed as Sanskrit and Malay&#257;lam tutors in the families of
those of high rank, and, in consequence, make free use of the title
Asan. They are strict Vaishnavites, and the asht&#257;kshara, or eight
letters relating to Vishnu, as opposed to the panch&#257;kshara or five
letters relating to Siva, forms their daily hymn of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>prayer. They act as their own caste priests, but
for the puny&#257;ha or purificatory ceremony and the initiation into
the asht&#257;kshara, which are necessary on special occasions, the
services of Br&#257;hmans are engaged.</p>
<p>The Pish&#257;ratis celebrate the t&#257;li-kettu ceremony before
the girl reaches puberty. The most important item therein is the
joining of the hands of the bride and bridegroom. The planting of a
jasmine shoot is observed as an indispensable preliminary rite. The
events between this and the joining of hands are the same as with other
Ambalav&#257;sis. The bride and bridegroom bathe, and wear clothes
touched by each other. The girl&rsquo;s mother then gives her a wedding
garland and a mirror, with which she sits, her face covered with a
cloth. The cherut&#257;li, or marriage ornament, is tied by the
bridegroom round the girl&rsquo;s neck. If this husband dies, the
t&#257;li has to be removed, and the widow observes pollution. Her sons
have to make oblations of cooked rice, and, for all social and
religious purposes, the woman is regarded as a widow, though she is not
debarred from contracting a sambandham (alliance) with a man of her own
caste, or a Br&#257;hman. If the wife dies, the husband has, in like
manner, to observe pollution, and make oblations of cooked rice. There
are cases in which the t&#257;li-kettu is performed by a
Pish&#257;rati, and sambandham contracted with a Br&#257;hman. If the
t&#257;li-tier becomes the husband, no separate cloth-giving ceremony
need be gone through by him after the girl has reached puberty.</p>
<p>Inheritance is in the female line, so much so that a wife and
children are not entitled to compensation for the performance of a
man&rsquo;s funeral rites.</p>
<p>No particular month is fixed for the name-giving rite, as it
suffices if this is performed before the annaprasana <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>ceremony. The maternal uncle first names the
child. When it is four or six months old, it is taken out to see the
sun. On the occasion of the annaprasana, which usually takes place in
the sixth month, the maternal uncle gives the first mouthful of cooked
rice to the child by means of a golden ring. The Yatrakali serves as
the night&rsquo;s entertainment for the assembled guests.
Namb&#363;tiris are invited to perform the purificatory ceremony known
as puny&#257;ha, but the consecrated water is only sprinkled over the
roof of the house. The inmates thereof protrude their heads beneath the
eaves so as to get purified, as the Br&#257;hmans do not pour the water
over them. The chaula or tonsure takes place at the third year of a
child&rsquo;s life. The maternal uncle first touches the boy&rsquo;s
head with a razor, and afterwards the M&#257;r&#257;n and barber do the
same. The initiation into the asht&#257;kshara takes place at the age
of sixteen. On an auspicious day, a Br&#257;hman brings a pot of water,
consecrated in a temple, to the pish&#257;ram, and pours its contents
on the head of the lad who is to be initiated. The ceremony is called
kalasam-ozhuk-kua, or letting a pot of water flow. After the teaching
of the asht&#257;kshara, the youth, dressed in religious garb, makes a
ceremonial pretence of proceeding on a pilgrimage to Benares, as a
Br&#257;hman does at the termination of the Br&#257;hmacharya stage of
life. It is only after this that a Pish&#257;rati is allowed to chew
betel leaf, and perform other acts, which constitute the privileges of
a Grihastha.</p>
<p>The funeral rites of the Pish&#257;ratis are very peculiar. The
corpse is seated on the ground, and a nephew recites the
asht&#257;kshara, and prostrates himself before it. The body is bathed,
and dressed. A grave, nine feet deep and three feet square, is dug in a
corner of the grounds, and salt and ashes, representing all the
Panchabh&#363;tas, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204"
name="pb204">204</a>]</span>are spread. The corpse is placed in the
grave in a sitting posture. As in the case of a Sany&#257;si, who is a
Jivanmukta, or one liberated from the bondage of the flesh though alive
in body, so a dead Pish&#257;rati is believed to have no suitable body
requiring to be entertained with any post-mortem offerings. A few
memorial rites are, however, performed. On the eleventh day, a ceremony
corresponding to the ekoddishta sr&#257;dh of the Br&#257;hman is
carried out. A knotted piece of kusa grass, representing the soul of
the deceased, is taken to a neighbouring temple, where a lighted lamp,
symbolical of Maha Vishnu is worshipped, and prayers are offered. This
ceremony is repeated at the end of the first year.<a class="noteref"

M&#363;ssads or M&#363;ttatus, Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar states that they
are known as M&#363;ttatus or M&#363;ssatus in Travancore and Cochin,
and Potuv&#257;ls (or Poduv&#257;ls) or Akapotuv&#257;ls in North
Malabar. Potuv&#257;l means a common person, <i>i.e.</i>, the
representative of a committee, and a M&#363;ttatu&rsquo;s right to this
name accrues from the fact that, in the absence of the Namb&#363;tiri
managers of a temple, he becomes their agent, and is invested with
authority to exercise all their functions. The work of an
Akapotuv&#257;l always lies within the inner wall of the shrine, while
that of the Purappotuv&#257;l, or Potuv&#257;l proper, lies outside.
From Travancore, Poduv&#257;n or Potuv&#257;n is recorded as a synonym
or sub-division of M&#257;r&#257;ns, who are employed at funerals by
various castes.</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of Malabar, that &ldquo;Pura
Pothuv&#257;ls are of two classes, Chenda Pothuv&#257;ls or drum
Pothuv&#257;ls, and M&#257;la Pothuv&#257;ls or garland Pothuv&#257;ls,
the names of course referring to the nature of the service which they
have to render in the temple. The Chenda Pothuv&#257;ls would appear to
be closely connected with the M&#257;r&#257;rs or M&#257;ray&#257;rs,
who are also drummers. M&#257;la Pothuv&#257;ls follow
marumakkatt&#257;yam (inheritance in the female line), their women
having sambandham (alliance) with men of their own caste or with
Br&#257;hmans, while the men can have sambandham in their own caste, or
with N&#257;yar women of any of the sub-divisions below Kiriyattil.
Their women are called Pothuv&#257;rassiar or

(bridegroom) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=

there alone for a few moments. Amongst the M&#257;la Pothuvals this is
done twice, once on the first and once on the last day, and they
apparently also spend the three nights of the ceremony in the same
bed-chamber, but not alone, an Enangatti sleeping there as chaperone.
In these two castes, as in most if not all others, the ceremony also
entails the pollution of the girl and her bridegroom. Amongst the
M&#257;r&#257;rs, they are purified by a Namb&#363;diri after they
leave their quasi-nuptial couch. Amongst the M&#257;la Pothuvals, they
are not allowed to bathe or to touch others during the wedding till the
fourth day, when they are given m&#257;ttu (change of cloths) by the
Veluttedan.&rdquo;</p>

feudal chiefs, occupying tracts more or less wild, and generally of
predatory habits in former days. They are now much the same as
Zemindars (land-owners) in the highest use of that term. The Southern
Poligars gave much trouble about a hundred years ago, and the
&lsquo;Poligar wars&rsquo; were somewhat serious affairs. In various
assaults on P&#257;nj&#257;lamkurichi, one of their forts in
Tinnevelly, between 1799 and 1801, there fell fifteen British
officers.&rdquo; The name Poligar was further used for the predatory
classes, which served under the chiefs. Thus, in Munro&rsquo;s

are said,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3037src" href="#xd21e3037" name=

hold a somewhat higher position, and in devil-dances to represent a
better class of demons. Unlike the Nalkes and Paravas, they follow the
aliya sant&#257;na system of inheritance. They speak Tulu, and, in
their customs, follow those of the Billavas. There are two sections
among the Pombadas, viz., Bailu, who are mainly cultivators, and
Padarti, who are chiefly engaged in devil-dancing. The Pombadas are
not, like the Nalkes and Paravas, a polluting class, and are socially a
little inferior to the Billavas. They do not wear the disguises of the
bh&#363;thas (devils) Nicha, Varte, and Kamberlu, who are considered
low, but wear those of Jumadi, Panjurli, Jarandaya, Mahisandeya, and
Kodamanithaya. Ullaya or Dharmad&#275;vata is regarded as a superior
bh&#363;tha, and the special bh&#363;tha of the Pombadas, who do not
allow Nalkes or Paravas to assume his disguise. During the Jumadi
K&#333;la (festival), the Pombada who represents the bh&#363;tha Jumadi
is seated on a cart, and dragged in procession through the streets.

palanquin-bearers of the Idaiyan caste. It seems probable that the

<p><b>Poroja.&mdash;</b>The Porojas or Parj&#257;s are hill cultivators
found in the Agency tracts of Ganjam and Vizagapatam. Concerning them,
it is noted, in the Madras Census Report, 1871, that &ldquo;there are
held to be seven classes of these Parj&#257;s, which differ from each
other in points of language, customs, and traditions. The term
Parj&#257; is, as Mr. Carmichael has pointed out, merely a corruption
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>of a Sanskrit term signifying a subject, and it
is understood as such by the people themselves, who use it in
contradistinction to a free hill-man. &lsquo;Formerly,&rsquo; says a
tradition that runs through the whole tribe, &lsquo;R&#257;jas and
Parj&#257;s were brothers, but the R&#257;jas took to riding horses
(or, as the Barenja Parj&#257;s put it, sitting still) and we became
carriers of burdens and Parj&#257;s.&rsquo; It is quite certain, in
fact, that the term Parj&#257; is not a tribal denomination, but a
class denomination, and it may be fitly rendered by the familiar
epithet of ryot (cultivator). I have laid stress on this, because all
native officials, and every one that has written about the country
(with the above exception), always talk of the term Parj&#257; as if it
signified a caste. There is no doubt, however, that by far the greater
number of these Parj&#257;s are akin to the Khonds of the Ganjam
M&#257;liahs. They are thrifty, hard-working cultivators, undisturbed
by the intestine broils which their cousins in the north engage in, and
they bear in their breasts an inalienable reverence for their soil, the
value of which they are rapidly becoming acquainted with. The
Parj&#257; bh&#363;mi (land) is contained almost entirely in the upper
level. Parts to the south held under P&#257;chipenta and M&#257;dugulu
(M&#257;dgole) are not Parj&#257; bh&#363;mi, nor, indeed, are some
villages to the north in the possession of the Khonds. Their ancient
rights to these lands are acknowledged by colonists from among the
Aryans, and, when a dispute arises concerning the boundaries of a field
possessed by recent arrivals, a Parj&#257; is usually called in to
point out the ancient land-marks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name Poroja seems to be derived from the Oriya, Po, son, and
R&#257;ja, <i>i.e.</i>, sons of R&#257;jas. There is a tradition that,
at the time when the R&#257;jas of Jeypore rose into prominence at
Nandapur, the country was occupied by a number of tribes, who, in
return for the protection <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href=
"#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>promised to them, surrendered
their rights to the soil, which they had hitherto occupied absolutely.
I am informed that the Porojas, when asked what their caste is, use
ryot and Poroja as synonymous, saying we are Porojas; we are ryot
people.</p>
<p>The Parj&#299; language is stated by Mr. G. A. Grierson<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3098src" href="#xd21e3098" name=
"xd21e3098src">108</a> to have &ldquo;hitherto been considered as
identical with Bhatr&#299;. Bhatr&#299; has now become a form of
Oriy&#257;. Parj&#299;, on the other hand, is still a dialect of
G&#333;ndi.&rdquo; The Bhatr&#257;s are a tribe inhabiting the state of
Bastar in the Central Provinces.</p>
<p>The Porojas are not a compact caste, but rather a conglomerate, made
up of several endogamous sections, and speaking a language, which
varies according to locality. These sections, according to Mr. C.
Hayavadana Rao, to whom I am indebted for much of the present note,
are&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) B&#257;rang Jhodia, who eat beef and speak Oriya.</p>
<p>(2) Pengu Poroja, subdivided into those who eat the flesh of the
buffalo, and those who do not. They speak a language, which is said to
bear a close resemblance to Kondhs.</p>
<p>(3) Kh&#333;ndi or K&#333;ndi Poroja, who are a section of the
Kondhs, eat beef and the flesh of buffaloes, and speak K&#333;du or
Kondh.</p>
<p>(4) Parengi Poroja, who are a section of the Gadabas. They are
subdivided into those who eat and do not eat the flesh of buffaloes,
and speak a Gadaba dialect.</p>
<p>(5) Bonda, B&#363;nda, or Nanga Poroja, who are likewise a section
of the Gadabas, call themselves Bonda Gadaba, and speak a dialect of
Gadaba. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p>(6) Tagara Poroja, who are a section of the K&#333;yas or
K&#333;yis, and speak K&#333;ya, or, in some places, Telugu.</p>
<p>(7) D&#363;r Poroja, also, it is said, known as Did&#257;yi Poroja,
who speak Oriya.</p>
<p>Among the B&#257;rang Jh&#333;dias, the gidda (vulture), b&#257;gh
(tiger), and n&#257;g (cobra) are regarded as totems. Among the Pengu,
K&#333;ndhi and D&#363;r divisions, the two last are apparently
regarded as such, and, in addition to them, the Bonda Porojas have
mandi (cow).</p>
<p>In the B&#257;rang Jhodia, Pengu, and K&#333;ndhi divisions, it is
customary for a man to marry his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter, but he
cannot claim her as a matter of right, for the principle of free love
is recognised among them. The dhangada and dhangadi basa system,
according to which bachelors and unmarried girls sleep in separate
quarters in a village, is in force among the Porojas.</p>
<p>When a marriage is contemplated among the B&#257;rang Jhodias, the
parents of the young man carry two pots of liquor and some rice to the
parents of the girl, who accept the present, if they are favourable to
the match. If it is accepted, the future bridegroom&rsquo;s party renew
the proposal a year later by bringing five kunchams of rice, a new
female cloth, seven uddas of liquor, and a sum of money ranging from
fifteen to fifty rupees. On the following evening, the bride,
accompanied by her relations, goes to the village of the bridegroom.
Outside his house two poles have been set up, and joined together at
the top by a string, from which a gourd (<i>Cucurbita maxima</i>) is
suspended. As soon as the contracting couple come before the house, a
tall man cuts the gourd with his tangi (axe) and it falls to the
ground. The pair then enter the house, and the bride is presented with
a new cloth by the parents of the bridegroom. Opposite the
bridegroom&rsquo;s house is a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212"
href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>square fence, forming an
enclosure, from which the bride&rsquo;s party watch the proceedings.
They are joined by the bride and bridegroom, and the parents of the
latter distribute r&#257;gi (<i>Eleusine Corocana</i>) liquor and ippa
(<i>Bassia</i>) liquor. A dance, in which both males and females take
part, is kept up till the small hours, and, on the following day, a
feast is held. About midday, the bride is formally handed over to the
bridegroom, in the presence of the Janni and Mudili (caste elders). She
remains a week at her new home, and then, even though she has reached
puberty, returns to her father&rsquo;s house, where she remains for a
year, before finally joining her husband. In another form of marriage
among the B&#257;rang Jhodias, the bride is brought to the house of the
bridegroom, in front of which a pandal (booth), made of six poles, is
set up. The central pole is cut from the n&#275;r&#275;di chettu
(<i>Eugenia Jambolana</i>). At the auspicious moment, which is fixed by
the Dis&#257;ri, the maternal uncle of the bridegroom sits with the
bridegroom on his lap, and the bride at his feet. Castor-oil is then
applied by the bridegroom&rsquo;s father, first to the bridegroom, and
then to the bride. A feast follows, at which fowls and liquor are
consumed. On the following day, the newly-married couple bathe, and the
ceremonies are at an end.</p>
<p>I am informed by Mr. H. C. Daniel that there is a custom among the
Porojas, and other classes in Vizagapatam (<i>e.g.</i>, Gadabas,
Gh&#257;sis, and M&#257;lis), according to which a man gives his
services as a goti for a specified time to another, in return for a
small original loan. His master has to keep him supplied with food, and
to pay him about two rupees at the Dussera festival, as well as making
him a present of a cloth and a pair of sandals. The servant must do
whatever he is told, and is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href=
"#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>practically a slave until the
specified time is over. A man may give his son as a goti, instead of
himself. It is also fairly common to find a man serving his prospective
father-in-law for a specified time, in order to secure his daughter.
Men from the plains, usually of the K&#333;mati caste, who have come to
the hills for the purpose of trade, go by the local name of Sundi. They
are the chief upholders of the goti system, by which they get labour
cheap. Mr. Daniel has never heard of a goti refusing to do his work,
the contract being by both sides considered quite inviolable. But a
case was recently tried in a Munsiff&rsquo;s Court, in which a goti
absconded from his original master, and took service with another,
thereby securing a fresh loan. The original master sued him for the
balance of labour due.</p>
<p>The language of the Bonda Porojas, as already indicated, connects
them closely with the Gadabas, but any such connection is stoutly
denied by them. The names Bonda and Nanga mean naked, and bear
reference to the fact that the only clothing of the women is a strip of
cloth made from s&#275;tukudi or ankudi chettu, or kareng fibre. In a
note on the Bhondas of Jaip&#363;r, Mr. J. A. May informs us<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3148src" href="#xd21e3148" name=
"xd21e3148src">109</a> that the female attire &ldquo;consists of just a
piece of cloth, either made of kerong bark and manufactured by
themselves, or purchased from the weavers, about a foot square, and
only sufficient to cover a part of one hip. It is attached to their
waists by a string, on which it runs, and can be shifted round to any
side. A most ludicrous sight has often been presented to me by a
stampede among a number of these women, when I have happened to enter a
village unexpectedly. On my approach, one and all hurried to their
respective <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>dwellings, and, as they ran in all directions,
endeavoured to shift this rag round to the part most likely to be
exposed to me.&rdquo; The Bonda women have glass bead and brass
ornaments hung round their necks, and covering their bosoms. The
legend, which accounts for the scanty clothing of the Bondas, runs to
the effect that, when S&#299;ta, the wife of R&#257;ma, was bathing in
a river, she was seen by women of this tribe, who laughed at and mocked
her. Thereon, she cursed them, and ordained that, in future, all the
women should shave their heads, and wear no clothing except a small
covering for decency&rsquo;s sake. There is a further tradition that,
if the Bonda women were to abandon their primitive costume, the whole
tribe would be destroyed by tigers. The shaving of the women&rsquo;s
heads is carried out, with a knife lent by the village Kom&#257;ro
(blacksmith), by a member of the tribe. Round the head, the women wear
a piece of bamboo tied behind with strings.</p>
<p>In one form of marriage, as carried out by the Bondas, a young man,
with some of his friends, goes to the sleeping apartment of the
maidens, where each of them selects a maid for himself. The young men
and maidens then indulge in a singing contest, in which impromptu
allusions to physical attributes, and bantering and repartee take
place. If a girl decides to accept a young man as her suitor, he takes
a burning stick from the night fire, and touches her breast with it. He
then withdraws, and sends one of his friends to the girl with a brass
bangle, which, after some questioning as to who sent it, she accepts.
Some months later, the man&rsquo;s parents go to the girl&rsquo;s home,
and ask for her hand on behalf of their son. A feast follows, and the
girl, with a couple of girls of about her own age, goes with the
man&rsquo;s parents to their home. They send five kunchams <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>of
rice to the parents of the girl, and present the two girls with a
similar quantity. The three girls then return to their homes. Again
several months elapse, and then the man&rsquo;s parents go to fetch the
bride, and a feast and dance take place. The pair are then man and
wife.</p>
<p>In another account of the marriage customs of the Nanga Porojas, it
is stated that pits are dug in the ground, in which, during the cold
season, the children are put at night, to keep them warm. The pit is
about nine feet in diameter. In the spring, all the marriageable girls
of a settlement are put into one pit, and a young man, who has really
selected his bride with the consent of his parents, comes and proposes
to her. If she refuses him, he tries one after another till he is
accepted. On one occasion, a leopard jumped into the pit, and killed
some of the maidens. In a note on Bhonda marriage, Mr. May
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3159src" href="#xd21e3159" name=
"xd21e3159src">110</a> that &ldquo;a number of youths, candidates for
matrimony, start off to a village, where they hope to find a
corresponding number of young women, and make known their wishes to the
elders, who receive them with all due ceremony. The juice of the salop
(sago palm) in a fermented state is in great requisition, as nothing
can be done without the exhilarating effects of their favourite
beverage. They then proceed to excavate an underground chamber (if one
is not already prepared), having an aperture at the top, admitting of
the entrance of one at a time. Into this the young gentlemen, with a
corresponding number of young girls, are introduced, when they grope
about and make their selection, after which they ascend out of it, each
holding the young lady of his choice by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>forefinger of one of her hands. Bracelets (the
equivalent of the wedding ring) are now put on her arms by the elders,
and two of the young men stand as sponsors for each bridegroom. The
couples are then led to their respective parents, who approve and give
their consent. After another application of salop and sundry greetings,
the bridegroom is permitted to take his bride home, where she lives
with him for a week, and then, returning to her parents, is not allowed
to see her husband for a period of one year, at the expiration of which
she is finally made over to him.&rdquo; In a still further account of
marriage among the Bondas, I am informed that a young man and a maid
retire to the jungle, and light a fire. Then the maid, taking a burning
stick, applies it to the man&rsquo;s gluteal region. If he cries out
Am! Am! Am! he is unworthy of her, and she remains a maid. If he does
not, the marriage is at once consummated. The application of the brand
is probably light or severe according to the girl&rsquo;s feelings
towards the young man. According to another version, the girl goes off
to the jungle with several men, and the scene has been described as
being like a figure in the cotillion, as they come up to be switched
with the brand.</p>
<p>Widow remarriage is permitted among all the divisions of the
Porojas, and a younger brother usually marries his elder
brother&rsquo;s widow.</p>
<p>The Jhodia, Pengu, and Kondhi divisions worship Bh&#363;mi
D&#275;vata (the earth goddess), who is also known as J&#257;kar
D&#275;vata, once in three years. Each village offers a cow, goat, pig,
and pigeon to her as a sacrifice. She is represented by a stone under a
tree outside the village. A casteman acts as p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest),
and all the villagers, including the Janni and M&#363;dili, are present
at the festival, which winds up with a feast and drink. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>The
Bondas worship T&#257;kur&#257;ni in the months of Chaitra and
M&#257;gho, and the festival includes the sacrifice of animals.
&ldquo;Their religious ceremonies,&rdquo; Mr. May writes,
&ldquo;consist in offerings to some nameless deity, or to the memory of
deceased relations. At each of the principal villages, the Bhondas
congregate once a year in some spot conveniently situated for their
orgies, when a chicken, a few eggs, and a pig or goat are offered,
after which they retire to their houses, and next day assemble again,
when the salop juice is freely imbibed till the intoxicating effects
have thoroughly roused their pugnacity. The process of cudgelling one
another with the branches of the salop now begins, and they apply them
indiscriminately without the smallest regard for each other&rsquo;s
feelings. This, with the attendant drums and shrieks, would give one
the impression of a host of maniacs suddenly set at liberty. This
amusement is continued till bruises, contusions, and bleeding heads and
backs have reduced them to a comparatively sober state, and, I imagine,
old scores are paid off, when they return to their several
houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dead are, as a rule, burnt. By some of the Jhodia Porojas, the
ashes are subsequently buried in a pit a few feet deep, near the
burning-ground, and the grave is marked by a heap of stones. A pole is
set up in this heap, and water poured on it for twelve days. On the
fourth day, cooked rice and fish are set on the way leading to the spot
where the corpse was burned. The celebrants of the death rite then take
mango bark, paint it with cow-dung, and sprinkle themselves with it.
The ceremony concludes with a bath, feast, and drink. Among the Bonda
Porojas, some of the jewelry of the deceased person is burnt with the
corpse, and the remainder given to the daughter or daughter-in-law.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>They observe pollution for three days, during
which they do not enter their fields. On the fourth day, they anoint
themselves with castor-oil and turmeric, and bathe.</p>
<p>Mr. G. F. Paddison informs me that he once gave medicine to the
Porojas during an epidemic of cholera in a village. They all took it
eagerly, but, as he was going away, asked whether it would not be
quicker cure to put the witch in the next village, who had brought on
the cholera, into jail.</p>
<p>A Bonda Poroja dance is said to be very humourous. The young men tie
a string of bells round their legs, and do the active part of the
dance. The women stand in a cluster, with faces to the middle, clap
their hands, and scream at intervals, while the men hop and stamp, and
whirl round them on their own axes. The following account of a dance by
the Jh&#333;dia Poroja girls of the Koraput and Nandapuram country is
given by Mr. W. Francis.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3180src" href=

arms and legs tattooed from wrist to shoulder, and from ankle to knee;
their left forearms hidden under a score of heavy brass bangles; and
their feet loaded with chased brass anklets weighing perhaps a dozen
pounds. The orchestra, which consists solely of drums of assorted
shapes and sizes, dashes into an overture, and the girls quickly group
themselves into a couple of <i>corps de ballet</i>, each under the

"pb219">219</a>]</span>time with a long baton of peacock&rsquo;s
feathers. Suddenly, the drums drop to a muffled beat, and each group
strings out into a long line, headed by the leader with the feathers,
each maiden passing her right hand behind the next girl&rsquo;s back,
and grasping the left elbow of the next but one. Thus linked, and in
time with the drums (which now break into <i>allegro crescendo</i>),
the long chain of girls&mdash;dancing in perfect step, following the
leader with her swaying baton, marking the time by clinking their
anklets (right, left, right, clink; left, clink; right, left, right,
clink; and so <i>da capo</i>), chanting the while (quite tunefully) in
unison a refrain in a minor key ending on a sustained falling
note&mdash;weave themselves into sinuous lines, curves, spirals,
figures-of-eight, and back into lines again; wind in and out like some
brightly-coloured snake; never halting for a moment, now backwards, now
forwards, first slowly and decorously, then, as the drums quicken,
faster and faster, with more and more abandon, and longer and longer
steps, until suddenly some one gets out of step, and the chain snaps
amid peals of breathless laughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following supplementary note on the Bonda Porojas, I am
indebted to Mr. C. A. Henderson.</p>
<p>These people live in the western portion of Malkanagiri t&#257;luk,
along the edge of the hills, probably penetrating some distance into
them. The elder men are not in any way distinguishable from their
neighbours. Young unmarried men, however, tie a strip of palmyra leaf
round their heads in the same way as the women of their own tribe, or
of the Gadabas. The women are very distinctly dressed. They all shave
their heads once a month or so, and fasten a little fillet, made of
beads or plaited grass, round them. The neck and chest are covered with
a mass of ornaments, by which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220"
href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>the breasts are almost
concealed. These consist, for the most part, of bead necklaces, but
they have also one or more very heavy brass necklaces of various
designs, some being merely collections of rings on a connecting
circlet, some massive hinged devices tied together at the end with
string. They wear also small ear-studs of lead. Apart from these
ornaments, they are naked to the waist. Round the loins, a small thick
cloth is worn. This is woven from the fibre of the ringa (Oriya
s&#299;tkodai gotsho). This cloth measures about two feet by eight
inches, and is of thick texture like gunny, and variously coloured.
Owing to its exiguity, its wearers are compelled, for decency&rsquo;s
sake, to sit on their heels with their knees together, instead of
squatting in the ordinary native posture. This little cloth is
supported round the waist by a thread, or light chain of tin and beads,
but not totally confined thereby. The upper edge of the cloth behind is
free from the chain, and bulges out, exposing the upper portion of the
buttocks, the thread or chain lying in the small of the back. It is
noted by Mr. Sandell that &ldquo;the cloth at present used is of
comparatively recent introduction, and seems to be a slight
infringement of the tabu. The original cloth and supporting string were
undoubtedly made of jungle fibre, and the modern colouring is brought
about with cotton thread. Similarly, the Bonda Poroja necklaces of
cheap beads, blue and white, must be modern, and most obviously so the
fragments of tin that they work into their chains. The women are said
to wear cloths in their houses, but to leave them off when they go
outside. It seems that the tabu is directed against appearing in public
fully clothed, and not against wearing decent sized cloths, as such.
The party I saw were mostly unmarried girls, but one of them had been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>married for a year. When not posing for the
camera, or dancing, she tied a small piece of cloth round her neck, so
as to hang over the shoulders. This, as far as I could make out, was
not because she was married, but simply because she was more shy than
the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two houses are kept in the village, for the unmarried girls
and young men respectively. Apparently marriages are matters of
inclination, the parents having no say in the matter. The young couple
having contracted friendship (by word of mouth, and not by deed, as it
was explained to me), inform their parents of it. The young man goes to
make his demand of the girl&rsquo;s parents, apparently without at the
time making any presents to them, contrary to the custom of the Kondhs
and others. Then there seem to be a series of promises on the part of
the parents to give the girl. But the witnesses were rather confused on
the point. I gather that the sort of final betrothal takes place in
Dyali (the month after Dusserah), and the marriage in Magha. At the
time of marriage, the girl&rsquo;s parents are presented with a pair of
bulls, a cloth, and a pot of landa (sago-palm toddy). But no return is
made for them. The father gives the girl some ornaments. The married
woman, whom I saw, had been given a bracelet by her husband, but it was
not a conspicuously valuable one, and in no way indicative of her
status.&rdquo; In connection with marriage, Mr. Sandell adds that
&ldquo;a youth of one village does not marry a maiden of the same
village, as they are regarded as brother and sister. The marriage pit
is still in use, and may last all through the cold weather. A number of
small villages will club together, and have one big pit.&rdquo; In the
case observed by Mr. Sandell, three of the local <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>maidens were shut up in the pit at night, and
five stranger youths admitted. The pit may be twelve feet across, and
is covered with tatties (mats) and earth, a trap-door being left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After childbirth, the mother is unclean for some days. The
time is, I gather, reckoned by the dropping of the navel-string, and is
given as eight to sixteen days. During that period, the woman is not
allowed to cook, or even touch her meals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These people say that they have no p&#363;ja (worship). But
at the time of sowing seed, they sacrifice one egg (for the whole
village) to Mat&#275;ra Hundi, the goddess of harvest, who is
represented by a branch of the kusi or j&#257;mo (guava) tree planted
in the village. The people have no p&#363;j&#257;ris, and, in this
case, the priest was a Mattia by caste. He plants the branch, and
performs the sacrifice. At the time of Nua Kh&#257;u (new eating; first
fruits) a sacrifice of an animal of some kind is also made to
Mat&#275;ra Hundi. Her aid is, they say, sought against the perils of
the jungle, but primarily she is wanted to give them a good crop. The
Bonda Porojas are quite ready to tell the old story of S&#299;ta (whom
they call Mah&#257; Lakshmi), and her curse upon their women, whereby
they shave their heads, and may not wear cloths. It is stated by Mr.
May that a Government Agent once insisted on a young woman being
properly clothed, and she survived the change only three days. I
understand that this case has been somewhat misrepresented. The cloth
is believed not to have been forced upon the girl, but offered to, and
greatly appreciated by her. Her death shortly afterwards was apparently
not the result of violation of the tabu, but accidental, and due, it is
believed, to small-pox. The people whom I saw had not heard of this
episode, but said that a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href=
"#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>woman who wore a cloth out of
doors would fall sick, not die. But the possibility of any woman of
theirs wearing a cloth obviously seemed to them very remote. The Bonda
Porojas have a sort of belief in ghosts&mdash;not altogether devils
apparently, but the spirits of the departed (sayir&#275;). These may
appear in dreams, influence life and health, and vaguely exercise a
helpful influence over the crops. I did not find out if they were
propitiated in any way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dead body is washed, tied to a tatty (mat) hurdle, taken
outside the village, and burnt. After eight days (said to be four in
the case of rich men), the corpse-bearers, and the family, sit down to
a funeral feast, at which drinking is not allowed. A pig, fowl, or
goat, according to the circumstances of the family, forms the meal.
This is done in some way for the sake of the departed, but how is not
quite clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bonda Porojas live by cultivation, keep cattle, pigs,
etc., and eat beef, and even the domestic pig. They pride themselves,
as against their Hindu neighbours, in that their women eat with the
men, and not of their leavings, and do not leave their village. The
women, however, go to shandies (markets).&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Pothoria.&mdash;</b>Pothoria or Pothriya, meaning stone, is the
name of a small class of Oriya stone-cutters in Ganjam, who are
addicted to snaring antelopes by means of tame bucks, which they keep
for the purpose of decoying the wild ones. They employ Br&#257;hmans as
pur&#333;hits. Marriage is infant, and remarriage of widows is
permitted. The females wear glass bangles.</p>
<p><b>P&#333;thu.&mdash;</b>P&#333;thu or P&#333;thula, meaning male,
occurs as an exogamous sept of D&#275;v&#257;nga, M&#275;dara, and
Padma S&#257;l&#275;; and P&#333;thula, in the sense of a male buffalo,

Oriya mat-makers. They are said to be immigrants from Potia in Orissa,
who call themselves Doluvas. The Doluvas, however, do not recognise
them, and neither eat nor intermarry with them.</p>
<p><b>Potta</b> (abdomen).&mdash;An exogamous sept of B&#333;ya.</p>
<p><b>Potti</b> (Tamil, worshipful).&mdash;Stated, in the Travancore

id="xd21e3266src" href="#xd21e3266" name="xd21e3266src">112</a> in
connection with the village of K&#333;iltirum&#257;lam or
Tiru-ambamah&#257;lam, that &ldquo;a new temple has been recently
built, and richly endowed by N&#257;ttuk&#333;ttai Chettis. There is,
however, an old story connected with the place, which is enacted at the
largely attended festival here, and in many popular dramas. This
relates that the god of the Tiruv&#257;l&#363;r temple was entreated by
a p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest) of this place to be present in the village
at a sacrifice in his (the god&rsquo;s) honour. The deity consented at
length, but gave warning that he would come in a very unwelcome shape.
He appeared as a Paraiyan with beef on his back and followed by the
four V&#275;das in the form of dogs, and took <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>his
part in the sacrifice thus accoutred and attended. All the
Br&#257;hmans who were present ran away, and the god was so incensed
that he condemned them to be Paraiyans for one hour in the day, from
noon till 1 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> ever afterwards. There is a
class of Br&#257;hmans called Midday Br&#257;hmans, who are found in
several districts, and a colony of whom reside at S&#275;danipuram,
five miles west of Nannilam. It is believed throughout the Tanjore
district that the Midday Paraiyans are the descendants of the
Br&#257;hmans thus cursed by the god. They are supposed to expiate
their defilement by staying outside their houses for an hour and a half
every day at midday, and to bathe afterwards; and, if they do this,
they are much respected. Few of them, however, observe this rule, and
orthodox persons will not eat with them, because of this omission to
remove the defilement. They call themselves the
Prathamas&#257;kha.&rdquo;</p>

mendicants attached to the K&#333;matis. The same name, or picchi
k&#257;ya, denoting the water-melon <i>Citrullus vulgaris</i>, occurs
as a sept or house-name of Panta Reddis and S&#275;niyans
(D&#275;v&#257;ngas), the members of which may not eat the fruit. The

<p><b>Pulluvan.&mdash;</b>The Pulluvans of Malabar are astrologers,
medicine-men, priests and singers in snake groves. The name is
fancifully derived from pullu, a hawk, because the Pulluvan is clever
in curing the disorders which pregnant women and babies suffer from
through the evil influence of these birds. The Pulluvans are sometimes
called Vaidyans (physicians).</p>
<p>As regards the origin of the caste, the following tradition is
narrated.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3370src" href="#xd21e3370" name=
"xd21e3370src">114</a> Agni, the fire god, had made several desperate
but vain efforts to destroy the great primeval forest of G&#257;ndava.
The eight serpents which had their home in the forest were the chosen
friends of Indra, who sent down a deluge, and destroyed, every time,
the fire which Agni kindled in order to burn down the forest.
Eventually Agni resorted to a stratagem, and, appearing before Arjunan
in the guise of a Br&#257;hman, contrived to exact a promise to do him
any favour he might desire. Agni then sought the help of Arjunan in
destroying the forest, and the latter created a wonderful bow and
arrows, which cut off every drop of rain sent by Indra for the
preservation of the forest. The birds, beasts, and other creatures
which lived therein, fled in terror, but most of them were overtaken by
the flames, and were burnt to cinders. Several of the serpents also
were overtaken and destroyed, but one of them was rescued by the
maid-servant of a Br&#257;hman, who secured <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>the
sacred reptile in a pot, which she deposited in a jasmine bower. When
the Br&#257;hman came to hear of this, he had the serpent removed, and
turned the maid-servant adrift, expelling at the same time a
man-servant, so that the woman might not be alone and friendless. The
two exiles prospered under the protection of the serpent, which the
woman had rescued from the flames, and became the founders of the
Pulluvans. According to another story, when the great G&#257;ndava
forest was in conflagration, the snakes therein were destroyed in the
flames. A large five-hooded snake, scorched and burnt by the fire, flew
away in agony, and alighted at Kuttan&#257;d, which is said to have
been on the site of the modern town of Alleppey. Two women were at the
time on their way to draw water from a well. The snake asked them to
pour seven potfuls of water over him, to alleviate his pain, and to
turn the pot sideways, so that he could get into it. His request was
complied with, and, having entered the pot, he would not leave it. He
then desired one of the women to take him home, and place him in a room
on the west side of the house. This she refused to do for fear of the
snake, and she was advised to cover the mouth of the pot with a cloth.
The room, in which the snake was placed, was ordered to be closed for a
week. The woman&rsquo;s husband, who did not know what had occurred,
tried to open the door, and only succeeded by exerting all his
strength. On entering the room, to his surprise he found an ant-hill,
and disturbed it. Thereon the snake issued forth from it, and bit him.
As the result of the bite, the man died, and his widow was left without
means of support. The snake consoled her, and devised a plan, by which
she could maintain herself. She was to go from house to house, and cry
out &ldquo;Give me alms, and be saved from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>snake poisoning.&rdquo; The inmates would give,
and the snakes, which were troubling their houses, would cease from
annoying them. For this reason, a Pulluvan and his wife, when they go
with their pulluva kudam (pot-drum) to a house, are asked to sing, and
given money.</p>
<p>The Pulluvar females, Mr. T. K. Gopal Panikkar writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3379src" href="#xd21e3379" name=
"xd21e3379src">115</a> &ldquo;take a pretty large pitcher, and close
its opening by means of a small circular piece of thin leather, which
is fastened on to the vessel by means of strings strongly tied round
its neck. Another string is adjusted to the leather cover, which, when
played on by means of the fingers, produces a hoarse note, which is
said to please the gods&rsquo; ears, pacify their anger, and lull them
to sleep.&rdquo; In the Malabar Gazetteer, this instrument is thus
described. &ldquo;It consists of an earthenware chatty with its bottom
removed, and entirely covered, except the mouth, with leather. The
portion of the leather which is stretched over the bottom of the vessel
thus forms a sort of drum, to the centre of which a string is attached.
The other end of the string is fixed in the cleft of a stick. The
performer sits cross-legged, holding the chatty mouth downwards with
his right hand, on his right knee. The stick is held firmly under the
right foot, resting on the left leg. The performer strums on the
string, which is thus stretched tight, with a rude plectrum of horn, or
other substance. The vibrations communicated by the string to the
tympanum produce a curious sonorous note, the pitch of which can be
varied by increasing or relaxing the tension of the string.&rdquo; This
musical instrument is carried from house to house in the daytime by
these Pulluvar <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>females; and, placing the vessel in a particular
position on the ground, and sitting in a particular fashion in relation
to the vessel, they play on the string, which then produces a very
pleasant musical note. Then they sing ballads to the accompaniment of
these notes. After continuing this for some time, they stop, and,
getting their customary dues from the family, go their own way. It is
believed that the music, and the ballads, are peculiarly pleasing to
the serpent gods, who bless those for whose sakes the music has been
rendered.&rdquo; The Pulluvans also play on a lute with snakes painted
on the reptile skin, which is used in lieu of parchment. The skin, in a
specimen at the Madras Museum, is apparently that of the big lizard
<i>Varanus bengalensis</i>. The lute is played with a bow, to which a
metal bell is attached.</p>
<p>The dwelling-houses of the Pulluvans are like those of the Izhuvans
or Cherumas. They are generally mud huts, with thatched roof, and a
verandah in front.</p>
<p>When a girl attains maturity, she is placed apart in a room. On the
seventh day, she is anointed by seven young women, who give an offering
to the demons, if she is possessed by any. This consists of the bark of
a plantain tree made into the form of a triangle, on which small bits
of tender cocoanuts and little torches are fixed. This is waved round
the girl&rsquo;s head, and floated away on water. As regards marriage,
the Pulluvans observe both t&#257;li-kettu and sambandham. In the
vicinity of Palghat, members of the caste in the same village
intermarry, and have a prejudice against contracting alliances outside
it. Thus, the Pulluvans of Palghat do not intermarry with those of
Mund&#363;r and Kanghat, which are four and ten miles distant. It is
said that, in former days, intercourse between brother and sister was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>permitted. But, when questioned on this point,
the Pulluvans absolutely deny it. It is, however, possible that
something of the kind was once the case, for, when a man belonging to
another caste is suspected of incest, it is said that he is like the
Pulluvans. Should the parents of a married woman have no objection to
her being divorced, they give her husband a piece of cloth called
murikotukkuka. This signifies that the cloth which he gave is returned,
and divorce is effected.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Pulluvan casting out devils.</p>
</div>
<p>The Pulluvans follow the makkath&#257;yam law of inheritance (from
father to son). But they seldom have any property to leave, except
their hut and a few earthen pots. They have their caste assemblies
(parichas), which adjudicate on adultery, theft, and other
offences.</p>
<p>They believe firmly in magic and sorcery, and every kind of sickness
is attributed to the influence of some demon. Abortion, death of a
new-born baby, prolonged labour, or the death of the woman, fever, want
of milk in the breasts, and other misfortunes, are attributed to
malignant influences. When pregnant women, or even children, walk out
alone at midday, they are possessed by them, and may fall in
convulsions. Any slight dereliction, or indifference with regard to the
offering of sacrifices, is attended by domestic calamities, and
sacrifices of goats and fowls are requisite. More sacrifices are
promised, if the demons will help them in the achievement of an object,
or in the destruction of an enemy. In some cases the village astrologer
is consulted, and he, by means of his calculations, divines the cause
of an illness, and suggests that a particular disease or calamity is
due to the provocation of the family or other god, to whom sacrifices
or offerings have not been made. Under these circumstances, a
Velichap&#257;d, or oracle, is consulted. After bathing, and dressing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>himself in a new mundu (cloth), he enters on the
scene with a sword in his hand, and his legs girt with small bells.
Standing in front of the deity in pious meditation, he advances with
slow steps and rolling eyes, and makes a few frantic cuts on his
forehead. He is already in convulsive shivers, and works himself up to
a state of frenzied possession, and utters certain disconnected
sentences, which are believed to be the utterances of the gods.
Believing them to be the means of cure or relief from calamity, those
affected reverentially bow before the Velichap&#257;d, and obey his
commands. Sometimes they resort to a curious method of calculating
beforehand the result of a project, in which they are engaged, by
placing before the god two bouquets of flowers, one red, the other
white, of which a child picks out one with its eyes closed. Selection
of the white bouquet predicts auspicious results, of the red the
reverse. A man, who wishes to bring a demon under his control, must
bathe in the early morning for forty-one days, and cook his own meals.
He should have no association with his wife, and be free from all
pollution. Every night, after 10 o&rsquo;clock, he should bathe in a
tank (pond) or river, and stand naked up to the loins in the water,
while praying to the god, whom he wishes to propitiate, in the words
&ldquo;I offer thee my prayers, so that thou mayst bless me with what I
want.&rdquo; These, with his thoughts concentrated on the deity, he
should utter 101, 1,001, and 100,001 times during the period. Should he
do this, in spite of all obstacles and intimidation by the demons, the
god will grant his desires. It is said to be best for a man to be
trained and guided by a guru (preceptor), as, if proper precautions are
not adopted, the result of his labours will be that he goes mad.

<p>A Pulluvan and his wife preside at the ceremony called P&#257;mban
Tullal to propitiate the snake gods of the n&#257;g&#257;tt&#257;n
k&#257;vus, or serpent shrines. For this, a pandal (booth) is erected
by driving four posts into the ground, and putting over them a silk or
cotton canopy. A hideous figure of a huge snake is made on the floor
with powders of five colours. Five colours are essential, as they are
visible on the necks of snakes. Rice is scattered over the floor.
Worship is performed to Gan&#275;sa, and cocoanuts and rice are
offered. Incense is burnt, and a lamp placed on a plate. The members of
the family go round the booth, and the woman, from whom the devil has
to be cast out, bathes, and takes her seat on the western side, holding
a bunch of palm flowers. The Pulluvan and his wife begin the music,
vocal and instrumental, the woman keeping time with the pot-drum by
striking on a metal vessel. As they sing songs in honour of the snake
deity, the young female members of the family, who have been purified
by a bath, and are seated, begin to quiver, sway their heads to and fro
in time with the music, and the tresses of their hair are let loose. In
their state of excitement, they beat upon the floor, and rub out the
figure of the snake with palm flowers. This done, they proceed to the
snake-grove, and prostrate themselves before the stone images of
snakes, and recover consciousness. They take milk, water from a tender
cocoanut, and plantains. The Pulluvan stops singing, and the ceremony
is over. &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; Mr. Gopal Panikkar writes, &ldquo;the
gods appear in the bodies of all these females, and sometimes only in
those of a select few, or none at all. The refusal of the gods to enter
into such persons is symbolical of some want of cleanliness in them:
which contingency is looked upon as a source of anxiety to the
individual.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3409width" id="pl6-233"><img src=
"images/pl6-233.jpg" alt="Pulluvan with pot-drum." width="720" height=

<p class="figureHead">Pulluvan with pot-drum.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p>It may also suggest the displeasure of these gods towards the
family, in respect of which the ceremony is performed. In either case,
such refusal on the part of the gods is an index of their ill-will or
dissatisfaction. In cases where the gods refuse to appear in any one of
those seated for the purpose, the ceremony is prolonged until the gods
are so properly propitiated as to constrain them to manifest
themselves. Then, after the lapse of the number of days fixed for the
ceremony, and, after the will of the serpent gods is duly expressed,
the ceremonies close.&rdquo; Sometimes, it is said, it may be
considered necessary to rub away the figure as many as 101 times, in
which case the ceremony is prolonged over several weeks. Each time that
the snake design is destroyed, one or two men, with torches in their
hands, perform a dance, keeping step to the Pulluvan&rsquo;s music. The
family may eventually erect a small platform or shrine in a corner of
their grounds, and worship at it annually. The snake deity will not, it
is believed, manifest himself if any of the persons, or articles
required for the ceremony, are impure, <i>e.g.</i>, if the pot-drum has
been polluted by the touch of a menstruating female. The Pulluvan, from
whom a drum was purchased for the Madras Museum, was very reluctant to
part with it, lest it should be touched by an impure woman.</p>
<p>The Pulluvans worship the gods of the Br&#257;hmanical temples, from
a distance, and believe in spirits of all sorts and conditions. They
worship Velayuthan, Ayyappa, R&#257;hu, M&#363;ni, Ch&#257;than,
Mukkan, Karinkutti, Parakutti, and others. M&#363;ni is a well-disposed
deity, to whom, once a year, rice, plantains, and cocoanuts are
offered. To Mukkan, Karinkutti, and others, sheep and fowls are
offered. A floral device (padmam) is drawn <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>on
the floor with nine divisions in rice-flour, on each of which a piece
of tender cocoanut leaf, and a lighted wick dipped in cocoanut oil, are
placed. Parched rice, boiled beans, jaggery (crude sugar), cakes,
plantains, and toddy are offered, and camphor and incense burnt. If a
sheep has to be sacrificed, boiled rice is offered, and water sprinkled
over the head of the sheep before it is killed. If it shakes itself, so
that it frees itself from the water, it is considered as a favourable
omen. On every new-moon day, offerings of mutton, fowls, rice-balls,
toddy, and other things, served up on a plantain leaf, are made to the
souls of the departed. The celebrants, who have bathed and cooked their
own food on the previous day, prostrate themselves, and say &ldquo;Ye
dead ancestors, we offer what we can afford. May you take the gifts,
and be pleased to protect us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pulluvans bury their dead. The place of burial is near a river,
or in a secluded spot near the dwelling of the deceased. The corpse is
covered with a cloth, and a cocoanut placed with it. Offerings of
rice-balls are made by the son daily for fifteen days, when pollution
ceases, and a feast is held.</p>
<p>At the present day, some Pulluvans work at various forms of labour,
such as sowing, ploughing, reaping, fencing, and cutting timber, for
which they are paid in money or kind. They are, in fact, day-labourers,
living in huts built on the waste land of some landlord, for which they
pay a nominal ground-rent. They will take food prepared by
Br&#257;hmans, N&#257;yars, Kamm&#257;lans, and Izhuvas, but not that
prepared by a Mann&#257;n or Kaniyan. Carpenters and Izhuvas bathe when
a Pulluvan has touched them. But the Pulluvans are polluted by
Cherumas, Pulayas, Paraiyans, Ull&#257;dans, and others. The women wear
the kacha, like Izhuva women, folded <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

another thinks that the correct word is P&#363;ruvan, aborigines. Their
girls are married usually after they attain maturity. In the disposal

<p class="first"><b>R&#257;cha</b> (= R&#257;ja).&mdash;R&#257;cha or
R&#257;chu, signifying regal, occurs as the title of various Telugu
classes, for example, Balija, Golla, K&#257;pu, Konda Dora, Koya,
Majjulu, and Velama. Some Perikes, who claim to be Kshatriyas, call
themselves R&#257;cha Perikes. R&#257;cha is further given as an
abbreviated form of Mutr&#257;cha.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;chevar.&mdash;</b>It is noted, in the Mysore Census
Report, 1901, that &ldquo;there are three broad distinctions founded on
the traditional occupation, but there are two main exclusive divisions
of Telugu and Kannada R&#257;chevars. One set, called Ranagare, are
military, and most of them are found employed in His Highness the
Mahar&#257;ja&rsquo;s R&#257;chevar and Bale forces. The second,
consisting of the Chitrag&#257;ras or Bannag&#257;ras, make good
paintings, decorations, and lacquered ware and toys. The last consists
of the Sarig&#275;, or gold lace makers. These people claim to be
Kshatriyas&mdash;a pretension not generally acquiesced in by the other
castes. They trace their origin to a passage in Brahm&#257;nda
Pur&#257;na, wherein it is said that, for an injury done to a
Br&#257;hman, they were condemned to follow mechanical
occupations.&rdquo; In connection with recent Dasara festivities at
Mysore, I read that there were wrestling matches, acrobatic feats,
dumb-bell and figure exercises by R&#257;chevars.</p>
<p>In the Tanjore Manual it is noted that the R&#257;chevars are
&ldquo;descendants of immigrants from the Telugu country, who
apparently followed the N&#257;yak viceroys of the Vijayanagar empire
in the sixteenth century. They are more or less jealous of the purity
of their caste. Their language is Telugu. They wear the sacred
thread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the city of Madras, and in other places in Tamil country, the
R&#257;chevars are called R&#257;zus or Mucchis, who must not be
confused with the Mucchis of Mysore <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>and the Ceded
districts, who are shoe-makers, and speak Mar&#257;thi. In the Telugu
country, there are two distinct sections of R&#257;chevars, viz.,
Saivite and Vaishnavite. The Saivite R&#257;chevars in the Kistna
district style themselves &#256;rya Kshatriyalu, but they are commonly
called Nak&#257;sh-v&#257;ndlu, which is a Hindustani synonym of
Chitrak&#257;ra or J&#299;nigiri-v&#257;ndlu. The Vaishnavites are
known as J&#299;nigiri-v&#257;ndlu, and are said not to intermarry with
the Saivites.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;fiz&#299;.&mdash;</b>A term, meaning a forsaker, used by
Sunni Muhammadans for any sect of Shiahs. The name appears, in the
Madras Census Report, 1901, as R&#257;bjee.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;gala</b> (r&#257;gi: <i>Eleusine Coracana</i>).&mdash;An
exogamous sept of Chembadi, Korava and M&#257;diga. The equivalent
R&#257;githannaya occurs as an exogamous sept of Bant. R&#257;gi grain
constitutes the staple diet of the poorer classes, who cannot afford
rice, and of prisoners in jails, for whom it is ground into flour, and
boiled into a pudding about the consistency of blanc-mange. The name is
derived from r&#257;ga, red, in reference to the red colour of the
grain.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;ghindala</b> (p&#299;pal: <i>Ficus religiosa</i>).&mdash;A
g&#333;tra of Gollas, the members of which are not allowed to use the
leaves of this tree as food-plates.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;jakan.&mdash;</b>A Sanskrit equivalent of Vann&#257;n
(washerman).</p>
<p><b>R&#257;jam&#257;hendram.&mdash;</b>The name, in reference to the
town of R&#257;jahmundry in the God&#257;vari district, of a
sub-division of Balija.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;j&#257;makan.&mdash;</b>A Tamil synonym for the Telugu
R&#257;zu.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;jav&#257;sal.&mdash;</b>The name, denoting those who are
servants of R&#257;jas, of a sub-division of Agamudaiyans, which has
been transformed into R&#257;javamsu, meaning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>those of kingly parentage. The equivalent
R&#257;javamsam is recorded, in the Census Report, 1901, as being
returned by some Maravans in Madura and Kurumbans in Trichinopoly.
R&#257;jakulam, R&#257;jab&#257;sha, or R&#257;jaboga occurs as a
sub-division of Agamudaiyan.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;jpinde.&mdash;</b><i>See</i> Arasu.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;jpuri.&mdash;</b>The R&#257;jpuris, or
R&#257;j&#257;puris, are a Konkani-speaking caste of traders and
cultivators in South Canara. Concerning them, Mr. H. A. Stuart writes
as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3607src" href="#xd21e3607" name=
"xd21e3607src">1</a> &ldquo;The R&#257;j&#257;puris, also called
B&#257;l&#333;likars, were originally traders, and perhaps have some
claim to be considered Vaisyas. In social status they admit themselves
to be inferior only to Br&#257;hmans. They wear the sacred thread,
profess the Saiva faith, and employ Kar&#257;di Br&#257;hmans as
priests in all their ceremonies. Their girls should be married before
the age of puberty, and marriage of widows is not permitted. The
marriage ceremony chiefly consists in the hands of the bride and
bridegroom being united together, and held by the bride&rsquo;s father
while her mother pours water over them. The water should first fall on
the bride&rsquo;s hands, and then flow on to those of the bridegroom.
This takes place at the bride&rsquo;s house. A curious feature in the
ceremony is that for four days either the bride or bridegroom should
occupy the marriage bed; it must never be allowed to become vacant.
[This ceremony is called pajamadmai, or mat marriage.] On the fourth
day, the couple go to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, where a similar
&lsquo;sitting&rsquo; on the marriage bed takes place. They are mostly
vegetarians, rice being their chief food, but some use fish, and rear
fowls and goats for sale as food. Many are now cultivators.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span></p>
<p>It may be noted that, among the Shivalli Br&#257;hmans, the mat is
taken to a tank in procession. The bride and bridegroom make a pretence
of catching fish, and, with linked hands, touch their foreheads.</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1891, R&#257;j&#257;puri Konkanasta is
given as a synonym of the R&#257;japuris, who are said to be one of the
sixty-six classes of Konkanasta people, who inhabited the sixty-six
villages of the Konkan. In the Census Report, 1901,
Kud&#257;ld&#275;shkara and K&#363;dluk&#257;ra are returned as
sub-divisions of R&#257;j&#257;puri. The K&#363;dluk&#257;ras are
Konkani-speaking confectioners, who follow the Br&#257;hmanical
customs.</p>

&ldquo;the warrior and land-owning race of Northern India, who are also
known as Th&#257;kur, lord, or Chhatri, the modern representative of
the ancient Kshatriya.&rdquo; At the Madras census, 1891 and 1901, the
number of individuals, who returned themselves as R&#257;jputs, was
13,754 and 15,273. &ldquo;It needs,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart

sub-divisions returned under the head R&#257;jput to show that many of
these individuals have no claim whatever to the title of R&#257;jput.
The number of pure R&#257;jputs in this Presidency must be very small
indeed, and I only mention the caste in order to explain that the
number of persons returning it is far in excess of the actual number of
R&#257;jputs.&rdquo; Mr. Stuart writes further<a class="noteref" id=

the R&#257;jputs of the North Arcot district that &ldquo;there are but
few of this caste in the district, and they chiefly reside in Vellore;
a few families are also found in Chittoor and Tirupati. They assert
that they are true Kshatriyas who came from R&#257;jput&#257;na
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=

any other claimants to a Kshatriya descent, have maintained their
fondness for military service. Almost all are sepoys or military
pensioners. Their names always end with Singh, and in many of their
customs they resemble the Muhammadans, speaking Hindustani, and
invariably keeping their wives gosha. They are often erroneously spoken
of by the people as Bondilis, a term which is applicable only to the
Vaisya and S&#363;dra immigrants from Northern India; but doubtless
many of these lower classes have taken the title Singh, and called
themselves R&#257;jputs. Members of the caste are, therefore, very
suspicious of strangers professing to be R&#257;jputs. Their cooking
apartment, called chowka, is kept most religiously private, and a line
is drawn round it, beyond which none but members of the family itself
may pass. At marriages and feasts, for the same reason, cooked food is
never offered to the guests, but raw grain is distributed, which each
cooks in a separate and private place.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Rang&#257;ri.&mdash;</b>The Rang&#257;ris are summed up, in the
Madras Census Report, 1891, as being &ldquo;a caste of dyers and
tailors found in almost all the Telugu districts. They are of
Mar&#257;tha origin, and still speak that language. They worship the
goddess Amb&#257;bhav&#257;ni. The dead are either burned or buried.
Their title is Rao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an account of the Rang&#257;ris of the North Arcot district, Mr.
H. A. Stuart writes that &ldquo;Rang&#257;ri is a caste of dyers,
chiefly found in W&#257;l&#257;j&#257;pet. They claim to be Kshatriyas,
who accompanied R&#257;ma in his conquest of Ceylon, from which fact
one of their names, Lang&#257;ri (lanka, the island, <i>i.e.</i>,
Ceylon), is said to be derived. R&#257;ma, for some reason or other,
became incensed against, and persecuted them. Most were destroyed, but
a respectable Kshatriya lady saved her two sons by taking off their
sacred threads and causing one to pretend that he was a tailor sewing,
and the other that he was a dyer, colouring his thread with the red
betel nut and leaf, which she hurriedly supplied out <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>of
her mouth. The boys became the progenitors of the caste, the members of
which now wear the thread. The descendants of the one brother are
tailors, and of the other, the most numerous, dyers. Their chief feasts
are the Dassara and K&#257;man, the former celebrated in honour of the
goddess Tuljabhavani and the latter of Manmada, the Indian Cupid,
fabled to have been destroyed by the flame of Siva&rsquo;s third eye.
During the K&#257;man feast, fires of combustible materials are
lighted, round which the votaries gather, and, beating their mouths,
exclaim &lsquo;laba, laba&rsquo;, lamenting the death of Cupid. In this
feast R&#257;jputs, Mahr&#257;ttas, Bondilis, and Guzer&#257;tis also
join. The Rang&#257;ris speak Mar&#257;thi, which they write in the
northern character, and name Poona and Shol&#257;pur as the places in
which they originally resided. In appearance they do not at all
resemble the other claimants to Kshatriya descent, the R&#257;zus and
R&#257;jputs, for they are poorly developed and by no means handsome.
Widow remarriage is permitted where children have not been born, but
remarried widows are prohibited from taking part in religious
processions, which seems a sign that the concession has been
reluctantly permitted. In most of their customs they differ but little
from the R&#257;zus, eating meat and drinking spirits, but not keeping
their women gosha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the Rang&#257;ris examined by me at Adoni in the Bellary
district were tailors. Like other Mar&#257;tha classes they had a high
cephalic index (av. 79; max. 92), and it was noticeable that the
breadth of the head exceeded 15 cm. in nine out of thirty
individuals.</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1901, Bahus&#257;gara, Malla or Mulla,
and N&#257;md&#275;v are given as synonyms, and Chimpiga (tailor) and
Unupulav&#257;du (dyer) as sub-castes of Rang&#257;ri. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p><b>R&#257;niyava.&mdash;</b>The R&#257;niyavas are Canarese-speaking
Holeyas, who are found near K&#257;p, Karkal, Mudibidri, and Mulki in
South Canara. They consider themselves to be superior to the
Tulu-speaking Holeyas, such as the Mari and Mundala Holeyas.</p>
<p>The R&#257;niyavas regard V&#299;rabadra Sw&#257;mi as their tribal
deity, and also worship M&#257;ri, to whom they sacrifice a buffalo
periodically. The bh&#363;ta (devil), which is most commonly
worshipped, is Varth&#275;. They profess to be Saivites, because they
are the disciples of the Lingayat priest at Gurup&#363;r.</p>
<p>Marriage is, as a rule, infant, though the marriage of adult girls
is not prohibited. The marriage rites are celebrated beneath a pandal
(booth) supported by twelve pillars. As among the Tulu castes, the
chief item in the marriage ceremony is the pouring of water over the
united hands of the bridal couple, who are not, like the Canarese
Holeyas in Mysore, separated by a screen.</p>
<p>Women who are found guilty of adultery, or of illicit intercourse
before marriage, are not allowed to wear bangles, nose-screw, or black
bead necklaces, and are treated like widows. Men who have been proved
guilty of seduction are not allowed to take part in the caste council
meetings.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the first menstrual period, a girl is under
pollution for twelve days. Eleven girls pour water over her head daily.
On the thirteenth day, the castemen are fed, and, if the girl is
married, consummation takes place.</p>
<p>Married men and women are cremated, and unmarried persons buried. On
the day of death, toddy must be given to those who assemble. Cooked
meat and food are offered to the deceased on the third, seventh, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>thirteenth days, and, on the seventh day, toddy
must be freely given.</p>
<p><b>Rao.&mdash;</b>The title of D&#275;sastha Br&#257;hmans, and
various Mar&#257;tha classes, Jains, and S&#275;rv&#275;g&#257;ras.
Some Perikes, who claim Kshatriya origin, have also assumed Rao
(=R&#257;ya, king) instead of the more humble Anna or Ayya as a
title.</p>
<p><b>Rarakkar.&mdash;</b>The Rarakkars or Vicharakkars are exorcisers
for the Kuravans of Travancore.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;ti</b> (stone).&mdash;A sub-division of Odd&#275;.</p>
<p><b>Ratna</b> (precious stones).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Kuruba.
The equivalent Ratn&#257;la is a synonym of R&#257;lla Balijas, who
deal in precious stones.</p>
<p><b>Rattu.&mdash;</b>A sub-division of Kaik&#333;lan.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;v&#257;ri.&mdash;</b>Recorded, in the Madras Census
Report, 1901, as a trading section of the N&#257;yars. The word is said
to be a corruption of Vy&#257;p&#257;ri, meaning trader. The equivalent
R&#257;v&#275;ri occurs as a class inhabiting the Laccadive
islands.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;vi Chettu</b> (p&#299;pal tree: <i>Ficus
religiosa</i>).&mdash;An exogamous sept of K&#257;lingi. The p&#299;pal
or aswatha tree may be seen, in many South Indian villages, with a
raised platform round it, before which Hindus remove their shoes, and
bow down. On the platform, village council meetings are often held. It
is believed that male offspring will be given to childless couples, if
they celebrate a marriage of the p&#299;pal with the n&#299;m tree
(<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>).</p>
<p><b>R&#257;vulo.&mdash;</b>It is recorded, in the Madras Census
Report, 1901, that &ldquo;there are three castes of temple servants
among the Oriyas, the R&#257;vulos, the M&#257;lis and the M&#363;nis.
The R&#257;vulos blow conches (shells of <i>Turbinella rapa</i>) in the
Saivite temples and at Br&#257;hmans&rsquo; weddings, sell flowers, and
regard themselves as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247"
name="pb247">247</a>]</span>superior to the other two. The M&#257;lis
do service in Saivite or Vaishnavite temples and sell flowers, but the
M&#363;nis are employed only in the temples of the village goddesses.
Among the R&#257;vulos, infant marriage is compulsory, but widow
marriage is allowed, and also divorce in certain cases. A curious
account is given of the punishment sometimes inflicted by the caste
panch&#257;yat (council) on a man who ill-treats and deserts his wife.
He is made to sit under one of the bamboo coops with which fish are
caught, and his wife sits on the top of it. Five pots of water are then
poured over the pair of them in imitation of the caste custom of
pouring five pots of water over a dead body before it is taken to the
burning-ground, the ceremony taking place in the part of the house
where a corpse would be washed. The wife then throws away a ladle, and
breaks a cooking-pot just as she would have done had her husband really
been dead, and further breaks her bangles and tears off her necklace,
just as would have been done if she was really a widow. Having thus
signified that her husband is dead to her, she goes straight off to her
parents&rsquo; house, and is free to marry again. Some R&#257;vulos
wear the sacred thread. They employ Br&#257;hmans as priests for
religious and ceremonial purposes. They eat fish and meat, though not
beef or fowls, but do not drink alcohol. Nowadays many of them are
earth-workers, cart-drivers, bricklayers, carpenters and day
labourers.&rdquo; It is further noted, in the Census Report, that
M&#257;li is &ldquo;an Oriya caste of vegetable growers and sellers,
and cultivators. Also a caste belonging to Bengal and Orissa, the
people of which are garland makers and temple servants. The statistics
confuse the two.&rdquo; In an account of the R&#257;vulos, as given to
me, R&#257;vulos, M&#363;nis, and M&#257;lis are not three castes, but
one caste. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>The M&#363;nis are said to worship, among
others, M&#363;nis or Rishis, Sakti, Siva, and Gan&#275;sa. A
M&#363;ni, named S&#257;rala Doss, was the author of the most popular
Oriya version of the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, and he is known as
S&#363;dra M&#363;ni, the S&#363;dra saint.</p>
<p>R&#257;vulo occurs further as a title of Kurumos who officiate as
priests in Siva temples in Ganjam, and M&#363;ni as a title of the
Sipiti temple servants.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;vutan.&mdash;</b>R&#257;vutan, or Rowthan, is a title used
by Labbai, Marakk&#257;yar, and J&#333;nagan Muhammadans. The
equivalent R&#257;vut or Raut has been recorded as a sub-caste of
Balija, and a title of Kannadiyan.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;ya R&#257;uturu.&mdash;</b>The name of certain chunam
[lime] burners in Mysore.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;yan.&mdash;</b>A title assumed by some Pallis or
Vanniyans, who wear the sacred thread, and claim to be Kshatriyas.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;yi</b> (stone).&mdash;An exogamous sept of M&#257;la.</p>
<p><b>R&#257;zu.&mdash;</b>The R&#257;zus, or R&#257;jus, are stated,
in the Madras Census Report, 1901, to be &ldquo;perhaps descendants of
the military section of the K&#257;pu, Kamma, and Velama castes. At
their weddings they worship a sword, which is a ceremony which usually
denotes a soldier caste. They say they are Kshatriyas, and at marriages
use a string made of cotton and wool, the combination peculiar to
Kshatriyas, to tie the wrist of the happy couple. But they eat fowls,
which a strict Kshatriya would not do, and their claims are not
universally admitted by other Hindus. They have three endogamous
sub-divisions, viz., Murikin&#257;ti, Nandimandalam, and
S&#363;ryavamsam, of which the first two are territorial.&rdquo;
According to another version, the sub-divisions are S&#363;rya (sun),
Chandra (moon), and Nandimandalam. In a note on the R&#257;zus of the
God&#257;vari district, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href=
"#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>Rev. J. Cain sub-divides them into
S&#363;ryavamsapu, Chandravamsapu, Veliv&#275;yabadina, or descendants
of excommunicated S&#363;ryavamsapu and R&#257;zulu. It may be noted
that some Konda Doras call themselves R&#257;ja (= R&#257;zu)
K&#257;pus or Reddis, and S&#363;ryavamsam (of the solar race).
&ldquo;In the God&#257;vari delta,&rdquo; Mr. Cain writes, &ldquo;there
are several families called Basava R&#257;zulu, in consequence, it is
said, of their ancestors having accidentally killed a basava or sacred
bull. As a penalty for this crime, before a marriage takes place in
these families, they are bound to select a young bull and young cow,
and cause these two to be duly married first, and then they are at
liberty to proceed with their own ceremony.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="figureHead">R&#257;zu bridegroom.</p>
</div>
<p>Of the R&#257;zus, Mr. H. A. Stuart writes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3783src" href="#xd21e3783" name="xd21e3783src">6</a> that
&ldquo;this is a Telugu caste, though represented by small bodies in
some of the Tamil districts. They are most numerous in Cuddapah and
North Arcot, to which districts they came with the Vijayanagar armies.
It is evident that R&#257;zu has been returned by a number of
individuals who, in reality, belong to other castes, but claim to be
Kshatriyas. The true R&#257;zus also make this claim, but it is, of
course, baseless, unless Kshatriya is taken to mean the military class
without any reference to Aryan origin. In religion they are mostly
Vaishnavites, and their priests are Br&#257;hmans. They wear the sacred
thread, and in most respects copy the marriage and other customs of the
Br&#257;hmans.&rdquo; The R&#257;zus, Mr. Stuart writes
further,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3786src" href="#xd21e3786" name=
"xd21e3786src">7</a> are &ldquo;the most numerous class of those who
claim to be Kshatriyas in North Arcot. They are found almost entirely
in the Karvetnagar estate, the zemindar being the head of the caste. As
a class they are the handsomest and best developed men <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>in
the country, and differ so much in feature and build from other Hindus
that they may usually be distinguished at a glance. They seem to have
entirely abandoned the military inclinations of their ancestors, never
enlist in the native army, and almost wholly occupy themselves in
agriculture. Their vernacular is Telugu, since they are immigrants from
the Northern Circars, from whence most of them followed the ancestors
of the Karvetnagar zamindar within the last two centuries. In religion
they are mostly Vaishnavites, though a few follow Siva, and the worship
of village deities forms a part of the belief of all. Their peculiar
goddess is called Nimish&#257;mba who would seem to represent Parvati.
She is so called because in an instant (nimisham) she once appeared at
the prayer of certain rishis, and destroyed some r&#257;kshasas or
giants who were persecuting them. Claiming to be Kshatriyas, the
R&#257;zus of course assume the sacred thread, and are very proud and
particular in their conduct, though flesh-eating is allowed. In all the
more well-to-do families the females are kept in strict
seclusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Vizagapatam district R&#257;zus are recognised as belonging
to two classes, called Konda (hill) and Bh&#363; (plains) R&#257;zu.
The former are further divided into the following sections, to which
various zamindars belong:&mdash;Konda, K&#333;du, Gaita, M&#363;ka,
Y&#275;n&#257;ti. The Konda R&#257;zus are believed to be hill chiefs,
who have, in comparatively recent times, adopted the title of
R&#257;zu.</p>
<p>For the following note on the R&#257;zus of the God&#257;vari
district, I am indebted to Mr. F. R. Hemingway. &ldquo;They say they
are Kshatriyas, wear the sacred thread, have Br&#257;hmanical
g&#333;tras, decline to eat with other non-Br&#257;hmans, and are
divided into the three classes, S&#363;rya <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>(sun), Chandra (moon), and Machi (fish). Of
these, the first claim to be descended from the kings of Oudh, and to
be of the same lineage as R&#257;ma; the second, from the kings of
Hastin&#257;pura, of the same line as the P&#257;ndavas; and the third,
from Hanum&#257;n (the monkey god) and a mermaid. Their women observe a
very strict rule of g&#333;sha, and this is said to be carried so far
that a man may not see his younger brother&rsquo;s wife, even if she is
living in the same house, without violating the g&#333;sha rule. The
betrothal ceremony is called nirnaya bh&#333;janam, or meal of
settlement. Written contracts of marriage (subha r&#275;ka) are
exchanged. The wedding is performed at the bride&rsquo;s house. At the
prad&#257;nam ceremony, no bonthu (turmeric thread) is tied round the
bride&rsquo;s neck. The bridegroom has to wear a sword throughout the
marriage ceremonies, and he is paraded round the village with it before
they begin. The g&#333;sha rule prevents his womenfolk from attending
the marriage, and the bride has to wear a veil. The ceremonies, unlike
those of other castes, are attended with burnt offerings of rice, etc.
Among other castes, the turmeric-dyed thread (kankanam), which is tied
round the wrists of the contracting couple, is of cotton; among the
R&#257;zus it is of wool and cotton. The R&#257;zus are chiefly
employed in cultivation. Some of them are said to attain no small
proficiency in Telugu and Sanskrit scholarship. Zamindars of this caste
regard K&#257;li as their patron deity. The R&#257;zus of
Amal&#257;puram specially adore Lakshmi. Some peculiarities in their
personal appearance may be noted. Their turbans are made to bunch out
at the left side above the ear, and one end hangs down behind. They do
not shave any part of their heads, and allow long locks to hang down in
front of the ears.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href=

<p>A colony of R&#257;zus is settled at, and around
R&#257;j&#257;p&#257;laiyam in the Tinnevelly district. They are said
to have migrated thither four or five centuries ago with a younger
brother of the King of Vizianagram, who belonged to the
P&#363;sap&#257;ti exogamous sept. To members of this and the
Gottimukkula sept special respect is paid on ceremonial occasions. The
descendants of the original emigrants are said to have served under
southern chieftains, especially Tirumala Naick. Concerning the origin
of the village R&#257;j&#257;p&#257;laiyam the following legend is
narrated. One Chinna R&#257;ju, a lineal descendant of the Kings of
Vizianagram, settled there with others of his caste, and went out
hunting with a pack of hounds. When they reached the neighbouring hill
Sanj&#299;viparvatham, they felt thirsty, but could find no water. They
accordingly prayed to Krishna, who at once created a spring on the top
of the hill. After quenching their thirst thereat, they proceeded
westward to the valley, and the god informed them that there was water
there, with which they might again quench their thirst, and that their
dogs would there be attacked by hares. At this spot, which they were to
consider sacred ground, they were to settle down. The present tank to
the westward of R&#257;j&#257;p&#257;laiyam, and the ch&#257;vadi
(caste meeting-place) belonging to the P&#363;sap&#257;tis are said to
indicate the spot where they originally settled.</p>
<p>The R&#257;j&#257;p&#257;laiyam R&#257;zus have four g&#333;tras,
named after Rishis, <i>i.e.</i>, Dhananjay&#257;, Kasyapa, Kaundinya
and Vasishta, which are each sub-divided into a number of exogamous
septs, named after villages, etc. They are all Vadagalai or Tengalai
Vaishnavites, but also worship Ayanar, and send k&#257;vadi (portable
canopy) to Palni in performance of vows. Their family priests are
Br&#257;hmans. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=

<p>The betrothal ceremony of the R&#257;zus of
R&#257;j&#257;p&#257;laiyam is generally carried out at the house of
the girl. On a raised platform within a pandal (booth), seven plates
filled with plantain fruits, betel, turmeric, cocoanuts, and flowers
are placed. A plate containing twenty-five rupees, and a r&#257;vike
(female cloth), is carried by a Br&#257;hman woman, and set in front of
the girl. All the articles are then placed in her lap, and the ceremony
is consequently called odi or madi ninchadam (lap-filling).</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s hair is decked with flowers, and she is smeared
with sandal and turmeric. A certain quantity of paddy (unhusked rice)
and beans of <i>Phaseolus Mungo</i> are given to the Br&#257;hman
woman, a portion of which is set apart as sacred, some of the paddy
being added to that which is stored in the granary. The remainder of
the paddy is husked in a corner of the pandal, and the beans are ground
in a mill. On the marriage morning, the bride&rsquo;s party,
accompanied by musicians, carry to the house of the bridegroom a number
of baskets containing cocoanuts, plantains, betel, and a turban. The
bridegroom goes with a pur&#333;hit (priest), and men and women of his
caste, to a well, close to which are placed some milk and the
nose-screw of a woman closely related to him. All the women sprinkle
some of the milk over his head, and some of them draw water from the
well. The bridegroom bathes, and dresses up. Just before their
departure from the well, rice which has been dipped therein is
distributed among the women. At the bridegroom&rsquo;s house the
milk-post, usually made from a branch of the vekkali (<i>Anogeissus
latifolia</i>) tree, is tied to a pillar supporting the roof of the
marriage dais. To the top of the milk-post a cross-bar is fixed, to one
arm of which a cloth bundle <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href=
"#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>containing a cocoanut, betel and
turmeric, is tied. The post is surmounted by leafy mango twigs. Just
before the milk-post is set up, cocoanuts are offered to it, and a
pearl and piece of coral are placed in a hole scooped out at its lower
end. The bundle becomes the perquisite of the carpenter who has made
the post. Only Br&#257;hmans, R&#257;zus and the barber musicians are
allowed to sit on the dais. After the distribution of betel, the
bridegroom and his party proceed to the house of the bride, where, in
like manner, the milk-post is set up. They then return to his house,
and the bridegroom has his face and head shaved, and nails pared by a
barber, who receives as his fee two annas and the clothes which the
bridegroom is wearing. After a bath, the bridegroom is conducted to the
ch&#257;vadi, where a gaudy turban is put on his head, and he is
decorated with jewels and garlands. In the course of the morning, the
pur&#333;hit, holding the right little finger of the bridegroom,
conducts him to the dais, close to which rice, rice stained yellow,
rice husk, jaggery (crude sugar), wheat bran, and cotton seed are
placed. The Br&#257;hmanical rites of puny&#257;hav&#257;achanam
(purification), j&#257;takarma (birth ceremony), n&#257;makaranam (name
ceremony), chaulam (tonsure), and upanayanam (thread ceremony) are
performed. But, instead of V&#275;dic chants, the pur&#333;hit recites
sl&#333;kas specially prepared for non-Br&#257;hman castes. At the
conclusion of these rites, the bridegroom goes into the house, and eats
a small portion of sweet cakes and other articles, of which the
remainder is finished off by boys and girls. This ceremony is called
p&#363;banth&#299;. The K&#257;siy&#257;tra (mock flight to Benares) or
Sn&#257;thakavritham is then performed. Towards evening the bridegroom,
seated in a palanquin, goes to the bride&rsquo;s house, taking with him
a tray containing an expensive woman&rsquo;s cloth, the t&#257;li tied
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>gold thread, and a pair of gold bracelets. When
they reach the house, the women who have accompanied the bridegroom
throw paddy over those who have collected at the entrance thereto, by
whom the compliment is returned. The bridegroom takes his seat on the
dais, and the bride is conducted thither by her brothers. A wide-meshed
green curtain is thrown over her shoulders, and her hands are pressed
over her eyes, and held there by one of her brothers, so that she
cannot see. Generally two brothers sit by her side, and, when one is
tired, the other relieves him. The pur&#333;hit invests the bridegroom
with a second thread as a sign of marriage. Damp rice is scattered from
a basket all round the contracting couple, and the t&#257;li, after it
has been blessed by Br&#257;hmans, is tied round the neck of the bride
by the bridegroom and her brothers. At the moment when the t&#257;li is
tied, the bride&rsquo;s hands are removed from her face, and she is
permitted to see her husband. The pair then go round the dais, and the
bride places her right foot thrice on a grindstone. Their little
fingers are linked, and their cloths tied together. Thus united, they
are conducted to a room, in which fifty pots, painted white and with
various designs on them, are arranged in rows. In front of them, two
pots, filled with water, are placed, and, in front of the two pots,
seven lamps. Round the necks of these pots, bits of turmeric are tied.
They are called avareti kundalu or avireni kundalu, and are made to
represent minor deities. The pots are worshipped by the bridal couple,
and betel is distributed among the Br&#257;hmans and R&#257;zus, of
whom members of the P&#363;sap&#257;ti and Gottimukkala septs take
precedence over the others. On the following day, the pur&#333;hit
teaches the sandyavandhanam (morning and evening ablutions), which is,
however, quite different from the Br&#257;hmanical rite. On
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>the morning of the third or n&#257;gavali day, a
quantity of castor-oil seed is sent by the bride&rsquo;s people to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s house, and returned. The bride and bridegroom go, in
a closed and open palanquin, respectively, to the house of the former.
They take their seats on the dais, and the bride is once more
blindfolded. In front of them, five pots filled with water are arranged
in the form of a quincunx. Lighted lamps are placed by the side of each
of the corner pots. On the lids of the pots five cocoanuts, plantains,
pieces of turmeric, and betel are arranged, and yellow thread is wound
seven times round the corner pots. The pots are then worshipped, and
the bridegroom places on the neck of the bride a black bead necklace,
which is tied by the Br&#257;hman woman. In front of the bridegroom
some salt, and in front of the bride some paddy is heaped up. An
altercation arises between the bridegroom and the brother of the bride
as to the relative values of the two heaps, and it is finally decided
that they are of equal value. The bridal pair then enter the room, in
which the avireni pots are kept, and throw their rings into one of the
pots which is full of water. The bridegroom has to pick out therefrom,
at three dips, his own ring, and his brother-in-law that of the bride.
The pur&#333;hit sprinkles water over the heads of the pair, and their
wrist-threads (kankanam) are removed. They then sit in a swing on the
pandal for a short time, and the ceremonies conclude with the customary
waving of coloured water (&#257;rati) and distribution of betel. During
the marriage ceremony, R&#257;zu women are not allowed to sit in the
pandal. The wives of the more well-to-do members of the community
remain g&#333;sha within their houses, and, strictly speaking, a woman
should not see her husband during the daytime. Many of the women,
however, go freely about the town <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257"
href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>during the day, and go to the
wells to fetch water for domestic purposes.</p>
<p>The R&#257;zus of R&#257;j&#257;p&#257;laiyam have R&#257;zu as the
agnomen, and, like other Telugu classes, take the g&#333;tra for the
first name, <i>e.g.</i>, Yaraguntala Muddusw&#257;mi R&#257;zu,
Gottimukkala Krishna R&#257;zu. The women adhere with tenacity to the
old forms of Telugu jewelry. The R&#257;zus, in some villages, seem to
object to the construction of a pial in front of their houses. The
pial, or raised platform, is the lounging place by day, where visitors
are received. The R&#257;zus, as has been already stated, claim to be
Kshatriyas, so other castes should not sit in their presence. If pials
were constructed, such people might sit thereon, and so commit a breach
of etiquette.</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1901, R&#257;j&#257;makan is given as a
Tamil synonym for R&#257;zu, and R&#257;zu is returned as a title of
the Bagata fishermen of Vizagapatam. R&#257;zu is, further, a general
name of the Bhatr&#257;zus.</p>

<p><b>Rona.&mdash;</b>The Ronas are a class of Oriya-speaking hill
cultivators, who are said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3873src" href=
"#xd21e3873" name="xd21e3873src">8</a> to &ldquo;hold a position
superior in the social scale to the Parjas (Porojas), from whom, by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>compulsion and cajolery, they have gotten unto
themselves estates. They are not of very long standing (in Jeypore).
Every Parja village head is still able to point out the fields that
have been taken from him to form the Rona hamlet; and, if he is in
antagonism with a neighbouring Parj&#257; village on the subject of
boundaries, he will include the fields occupied by the Rona as
belonging <i>de jure</i> to his demesne.&rdquo; In the Madras Census
Report, 1891, it is noted that &ldquo;the Ronas are supposed to be the
descendants of Ranjit, the great warrior of Orissa. In social status
they are said to be a little inferior to the so-called Kshatriyas. Some
of them serve as armed retainers and soldiers of the native chiefs, and
some are engaged in trade and cultivation.<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e3881" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>For the following note I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The
word rona means battle. According to a tradition current among the
Ronas, their ancestors, who were seven brothers, came many generations
ago to Nundap&#363;r, the former capital of the R&#257;jas of Jeypore,
and made their first settlement in Borra.</p>
<p>The caste is divided into four endogamous divisions,
viz.:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Rona Paiko.</li>
<li>(2) Odiya Paiko, said to rank a little higher than the
preceding.</li>
<li>(3) Kottiya Paiko, the descendants of Rona Paikos and women of hill
tribes.</li>
<li>(4) Pattiya Paik, the descendants of Kottiya Paikos and women of
hill tribes.</li>
</ul>
<p>As examples of septs among the Ronas, the following may be
cited:&mdash;K&#333;ra (sun), Bh&#257;g (tiger), N&#257;g (cobra),
Khinbudi (bear), and Matsya (fish).</p>
<p>When a girl reaches puberty, she is placed apart in a portion of the
house where she cannot be seen by males, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>even of the
household, and sits in a space enclosed by seven arrows connected
together by a thread. On the seventh day she bathes, and is presented
with a new cloth. It is customary for a man to marry his paternal
uncle&rsquo;s daughter. At the time of marriage, the bridegroom&rsquo;s
party repair to the house of the bride with a sheep, goat, rice, and a
female cloth with a rupee placed on it, and four quarter-anna bits
inserted within its fold. The cloth and money are taken by the
bride&rsquo;s mother, and the animals and rice are used for a feast. On
the following day, the bride goes to the house of the bridegroom, in
front of which a pandal (booth), made out of nine poles of the
n&#275;r&#275;du tree (<i>Eugenia Jambolana</i>) has been set up. At
the auspicious hour, which has been fixed by the D&#275;s&#257;ri who
officiates, in the absence of a Br&#257;hman, at the marriage rites,
the bride and bridegroom take their seats in the pandal with a curtain
between them. The D&#275;s&#257;ri joins their hands together, and ties
to the ends of their cloths a new cloth to which a quarter-anna piece
is attached, betel leaves and nuts, and seven grains of rice. The
curtain is then removed, and the pair enter the house. The knotted new
cloth is removed, and kept in the house during the next two days, being
untied and re-tied every morning. On the third day, the couple again
come within the pandal, and the new cloth is again tied to them. They
are bathed together in turmeric water, and the cloth is then untied for
the last time. The rice is examined to see if it is in a good state of
preservation, and its condition is regarded as an omen for good or
evil. The remarriage of widows is permitted, and a younger brother
usually marries the widow of his elder brother.</p>
<p>There is for all the Ronas a headman of their caste, called Bhatho
N&#257;yako, at Nundap&#363;r, who decides <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>offences, such as eating in the house of a man
of inferior caste, and performs the ceremonial cleansing of a man who
has been beaten with a shoe. Divorce and civil suits are settled by a
caste council.</p>
<p>The Ronas worship the deity T&#257;kur&#257;ni. They wear the sacred
thread, and are said to have bought the right to do so from a former
R&#257;ja of Jeypore. They also wear a necklace of tulsi <i>(</i>Ocimum
sanctum) beads. The necklace is first tied on by Oriya Br&#257;hmans
from Orissa, or Vaishnava Br&#257;hmans from Srik&#363;rmam in Ganjam,
who pay periodic visits to the community, and receive presents of money
and food. Rona Paikos will eat at the hands of Br&#257;hmans only,
whereas Puttiya Paikos will eat in the houses of Koronos, M&#257;lis,
Kumm&#257;ras, and Gaudos. All eat animal food, beef and pork
excepted.</p>
<p>Some Ronas are still the armed retainers of the Jeypore R&#257;jas,
and their forefathers were versed in the use of the matchlock. Some
Ronas at the present day use bows and arrows. The caste title is
N&#257;yako.</p>
<p><b>Ronguni.&mdash;</b>The Rongunis are Oriya dyers and weavers. The
caste name is derived from rangu, dye. A noticeable fact is that they
do not eat flesh of any kind, but are vegetarians, pure and simple.
They have various titles, <i>e.g.</i>, B&#275;hara, D&#257;so, Prushti,
and S&#257;hu, of which some practically constitute exogamous
septs.</p>
<p><b>Rottala</b> (bread).&mdash;An exogamous sept of B&#333;ya.</p>
<p><b>Rowthan.&mdash;</b><i>See</i> R&#257;vutan.</p>
<p><b>R&#363;dra.&mdash;</b>One of the various names of Siva. A
sub-division of Palli.</p>
<p><b>R&#363;dr&#257;kshala</b> (the drupe of <i>El&aelig;ocarpus
Ganitrus</i>).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Karna S&#257;l&#275;s. The
drupes are polished, and worn as a rosary or necklet by Saivite
Br&#257;hmans, Pand&#257;rams, N&#257;ttuk&#333;ttai Chettis, and
others. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>They are supposed to be the tears of ecstasy
which Siva (R&#363;dra) once shed, and are consequently sacred to him.
They have a number of lobes (or faces), varying from one to six,
divided externally by deep furrows. Those with five lobes are the most
common, but those with one (eka mukha) or six (shan mukha) are very
rare, and have been known to be sold for a thousand rupees. One form of
the drupe is called Gauri shanka, and is worn in a golden receptacle by
D&#299;kshitar Br&#257;hmans at Chidambaram, and by some Pand&#257;rams
who are managers of matams (religious institutions). The plate
represents a Telugu Saivite Vaidiki Br&#257;hman clad in a coat of
rudr&#257;ksha beads, wearing a head-dress of the same, and holding in
his hand wooden castanets, which are played as an accompaniment to his
songs. Until he became too old to bear the weight, he wore also a
loin-cloth made of these beads.</p>

C. Hayavadana Rao states that, unlike the Samayamuv&#257;ru, they are
attached only to the Padma S&#257;l&#275; section of the S&#257;l&#275;

S&#257;dhinchinav&#257;ru, <i>i.e.</i>, those who conquered
R&#275;nuk&#257; Sakthi. According to tradition, R&#275;nuk&#257; was
the mother of Parasur&#257;ma, one of the avatars of Vishnu, and is
identified with the goddess Yellamm&#257;, whom the Padma
S&#257;l&#275;s revere. The S&#257;dhana S&#363;rulu are her votaries.
Ages ago, it is said, they prayed to her on behalf of the Padma

the name is said to have been earned by the community in the following
manner. In remote times a certain Br&#257;hman came upon hidden
treasure, but, to his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href=
"#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>amazement, the contents appeared
in his eye to be all live scorpions. Out of curiosity, he hung one of
them outside his house. A little while after, a woman of inferior
caste, who was passing by the house, noticed it to be gold, and, upon
her questioning him about it, the Br&#257;hman espoused her, and by her
means was able to enjoy the treasure. He gave a feast in honour of his
acquisition of wealth. He was subsequently outcasted for his
m&eacute;salliance with the low caste female, while those that ate with
him were put under a ban, and thus acquired the nickname.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Sakuna Pakshi.&mdash;</b>For the following note on the Sakuna
Pakshi (prophetic bird) mendicant caste of Vizagapatam, I am indebted
to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The name of the caste is due to the fact that
the members of the caste wear on their heads a plume composed of the
feathers of a bird called p&#257;lagumma, which is probably <i>Coracias
indica</i>, the Indian roller, or &ldquo;blue jay&rdquo; of Europeans.
This is one of the birds called sakuna pakshi, because they are
supposed to possess the power of foretelling events, and on their
movements many omens <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264"

be liberated by the R&#257;jah, amidst the firing of cannon and
musketry, at a grand parade attended by all the officers of the
station. Buchanan Hamilton also states that, before the Durga Puja, the
Hindus of Calcutta purchase one of these birds, and, at the time when
they throw the image of Durga into the river, set it at liberty. It is
considered propitious to see it on this day, and those who cannot
afford to buy one discharge their matchlocks to put it on the
wing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to their own account, the Sakuna Pakshis are Telagas who
emigrated to Vizagapatam from Pedd&#257;puram in the God&#257;vari
district.</p>
<p>A member of the caste, before proceeding on a begging expedition,
rises early, and has a cold meal. He then puts the Tengalai Vaishnava
n&#257;mam mark on his forehead, slings on his left shoulder a
deer-skin pouch for the reception of the rice and other grain which
will be given him as alms, and takes up his little drum (gilaka or
damaraka) made of frog&rsquo;s skin. It is essential for a successful
day&rsquo;s begging that he should first visit a M&#257;la house or
two, after which he begs from other castes, going from house to
house.</p>
<p>The members combine with begging the professions of devil-dancer,
sorcerer, and quack doctor. Their remedy for scorpion sting is
well-known. It is the root of a plant called th&#275;lla visari
(scorpion antidote), which the Sakuna Pakshis carry about with them on
their rounds. The root should be collected on a new-moon day which
falls on a Sunday. On that day, the Sakuna Pakshi <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>bathes, cuts off his loin-string, and goes stark
naked to a selected spot, where he gathers the roots. If a supply
thereof is required, and the necessary combination of moon and day is
not forthcoming, the roots should be collected on a Sunday or
Wednesday.</p>
<p><b>Salanguk&#257;ran.&mdash;</b>In the Madras Census Report, 1901,
Salangaik&#257;ran is returned as a synonym of Karaiy&#257;n or
Sembadavan fishermen. The word salangu or slangu is used for pearl
fisheries, and Salanguk&#257;ran is, I imagine, a name applied to pearl
divers.</p>
<p><b>S&#257;l&#257;pu.&mdash;</b>The S&#257;l&#257;pus are a small
caste of Telugu weavers in Vizagapatam, for the following note on whom
I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The name S&#257;l&#257;pu seems
to be a corruption of Saluppan, a caste which formerly engaged in the
manufacture of gunny-bags and coarse cloths. The S&#257;l&#257;pus at
the present day make such cloths, commonly called g&#257;manch&#257;lu.
Like some other weaving castes, they claim descent from Markand&#275;ya
rishi, who was remarkable for his austerities and great age, and is
also known as D&#299;rgh&#257;yus. The S&#257;l&#257;pus will not eat,
or intermarry with S&#257;l&#275;s. The caste is governed by a headman
called S&#275;n&#257;pati. He decides disputes, and, on occasions of
marriage, receives the first share of betel and sandal, and is the
first to touch the satham&#257;nam (marriage badge) when it is passed
round to be blessed by those assembled. He is, at marriages, further
presented with a rupee. At caste feasts, it is his privilege to partake
of food first.</p>
<p>Like other Telugu castes, the S&#257;l&#257;pus have
intip&#275;rulu, or exogamous septs. Girls are generally married before
puberty. The custom of m&#275;narikam, by which a man should marry his
maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter, is in force. The turmeric ceremony
takes place some months before marriage. Some male and female relations
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>the future bridegroom repair to the house of the
girl, taking with them a few rupees as the bride-price (v&#333;li). The
girl bathes, and daubs herself with turmeric paste. A solid silver
bangle is then put on her right wrist. The remarriage of widows and
divorce are permitted.</p>
<p>The S&#257;l&#257;pus are divided into Lingavantas and Vaishnavas,
who intermarry. The former bury their dead in a sitting posture, and
the latter practice cremation. Jangams officiate for the Lingavantas,
and S&#257;t&#257;nis for Vaishnavas. Both sections observe the chinna
(little) and pedda r&#333;zu (big day) death ceremonies.</p>
<p>The caste title is generally Ayya.</p>
<p><b>S&#257;l&#257;pu.&mdash;</b>A form of S&#257;r&#257;pu, an
occupational term for those who deal in coins, jewelry, coral, etc.</p>
<p><b>S&#257;l&#275;.&mdash;</b>The S&#257;l&#275;s are the great
weaver class among the Telugus, for the following note on whom I am
indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao.</p>
<p>The name is derived from Sanskrit, S&#257;lika, a weaver. The
S&#257;l&#275;s call themselves S&#275;n&#257;pati
(commander-in-chief), and this is further the title of the caste
headman. They are divided into two main endogamous sections, Padma or
lotus, and Pattu or silk. Between them there are three well-marked
points of difference, viz., (1) the Pattu S&#257;l&#275;s wear the
sacred thread, whereas the Padma S&#257;l&#275;s do not; <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e4078" title="Not in source">(2)</span> the Pattu
S&#257;l&#275;s do not take food or water at the hands of any except
Br&#257;hmans, whereas the Padma S&#257;l&#275;s will eat in K&#257;pu,
Golla, Telaga, Gavara, etc., houses; (3) the Pattu S&#257;l&#275;s
weave superfine cloths, and, in some places, work in silk, whereas
Padma S&#257;l&#275;s weave only coarse cloths. Each section is divided
into a number of exogamous septs or intip&#275;rulu. Both speak Telugu,
and are divided into Vaishnavites and Saivites. These religious
distinctions are no bar to intermarriage and interdining. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district (1907),
that &ldquo;on the plains, cotton cloths are woven in hundreds of
villages by S&#257;l&#275;s, Padma S&#257;l&#275;s, Pattu
S&#257;l&#275;s, D&#275;v&#257;ngas, and S&#257;l&#257;pus. The ryots
often spin their own cotton into thread, and then hand it over to the
weavers to be made into cloths, but large quantities of machine-made
yarn are used. In the south, the chief weaving centres are Nakkapalli
and P&#257;yakaraop&#275;ta in Sarvasiddhi t&#257;luk, the Pattu
S&#257;l&#275;s in the latter of which turn out fabrics of fine thread,
enriched with much gold and silver &lsquo;lace,&rsquo; which are in
great demand in the God&#257;vari and Ganjam districts. At
R&#257;z&#257;m, coloured cloths for women are the chief product, and
in the country round this place the white garments so universal
everywhere give place to coloured dress. The cloths are sold locally,
and also sent in large quantities to Berhampur, Cuttack, and even
Calcutta. Most of the weaving is in the hands of D&#275;v&#257;ngas,
but the dyeing of the thread is done with imported aniline and
alizarine colours by the Balijas of Sigadam in Ch&#299;purupalle
t&#257;luk and Balijap&#275;ta in Bobbili. In Siripuram and
Pond&#363;ru, the Pattu S&#257;l&#275;s make delicate fabrics from
especially fine thread, called Pattu S&#257;l&#275; n&#363;lu, or
silk-weaver&rsquo;s thread, which the women of their caste spin for
them, and which is as fine as imported 1508. These are much valued by
well-to-do natives for their softness and durability. The weaving
industry is on the decline throughout the district, except perhaps in
R&#257;z&#257;m, and the weaver castes are taking to other means of
livelihood. Round Ch&#299;purupalle, for example, the Pattu
S&#257;l&#275;s have become experts in tobacco-curing, and have made
such profits that they are able to monopolise much of the trade and
money-lending of the locality.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb268" href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span></p>
<p>Concerning the origin of the S&#257;l&#275; caste, it is stated, in
the &#256;ndhrapada P&#257;rij&#257;tamu, that it is the result of an
union between a Kamsala man and a potter woman. According to a current
legend, the celestials (d&#275;vatas), being desirous of securing
clothing for themselves and their dependents, asked Markand&#275;ya
Rishi to supply them with it. He went to Vishnu, and prayed to him. The
god directed him to make a sacrificial offering to Indra, the celestial
king. Markand&#275;ya accordingly performed a great sacrifice, and from
the fire issued Bh&#257;vana Rishi, with a ball of thread in his hands,
which he had manufactured, under Vishnu&rsquo;s direction, from the
fibre of the lotus which sprang from the god&rsquo;s navel. With this
ball of thread he proceeded to make cloths for the celestials. He
subsequently married Bhadrav&#257;thi, the daughter of S&#363;rya (the
sun), who bore him a hundred and one sons, of whom a hundred became the
ancestors of the Padma S&#257;l&#275;s, while the remaining man was the
ancestor of the Pattu S&#257;l&#275;s.</p>
<p>The caste worships Bh&#257;vana Rishi. At the close of the year, the
caste occupation is stopped before the Sankramanam for ten days. Before
they start work again, the Pattu S&#257;l&#275;s meet at an appointed
spot, where they burn camphor, and wave it before a ball of thread,
which represents Bh&#257;vana Rishi. A more elaborate rite is performed
by the Padma S&#257;l&#275;s. They set apart a special day for the
worship of the deified ancestor, and hold a caste feast. A special
booth is erected, in which a ball of thread is placed. A caste-man acts
as p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest), and fruits, flowers, camphor, etc., are
offered to the thread.</p>
<p>The Telugu Padma S&#257;l&#275;s, and Mar&#257;thi-speaking
Suk&#363;n and Suka S&#257;l&#275;s, are, as will be seen from the

<p>Writing in the eighteenth century, Sonnerat remarks that the weaver
fixes his loom under a tree before his house in the morning, and at
night takes it home. And this observation holds good at the present
day. Weaving operations, as they may be seen going on at weaving
centres in many parts of Southern India, are thus described by Mr. H.
A. Stuart.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4127src" href="#xd21e4127" name=
"xd21e4127src">2</a> &ldquo;The process of weaving is very simple. The
thread is first turned off upon a hand-spindle, and then the warp is
formed. Bamboo sticks, 120 in number, are fixed upright in the ground,
generally in the shade of a tope or grove, at a distance of a cubit
from one another, and ten women or children, carrying r&#257;tnams
(spindles) in their hands, walk up and down this line, one behind the
other, intertwining the thread between the bamboos, until 1,920 threads
of various colours, according to the pattern desired, are thus
arranged. For this work each gets half an anna&mdash;a small
<span class="corr" id="xd21e4130" title=
"Source: renumeration">remuneration</span> for walking four miles. To
form a warp sufficient for eight women&rsquo;s cloths, forty miles have
thus to be traversed. In weaving silk cloths or the finer fabrics, the
length of the warp is less than sixty yards. As soon as the threads
have been arranged, the bamboos are plucked up, and rolled together
with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>threads upon them. Trestles are then set out in
the tope, and upon them the warp with the bamboos is stretched
horizontally, and sized by means of large long brushes with r&#257;gi
starch, and carried along by two men. This having dried, the whole is
rolled up, and placed in the loom in the weaver&rsquo;s house. The
weaving room is a long, narrow, dark chamber, lighted by one small
window close to where the workman sits. The loom is constructed on the
simplest principles, and can be taken to pieces in a few minutes,
forming a light load for a man. The alternate threads of the warp are
raised and depressed, to receive the woof in the following manner. Two
pairs of bamboos are joined together by thin twine loops, and, being
suspended from the roof, are also joined to two pedals near the floor.
Through the joining loops of one pair of bamboos run half the threads,
and through those of the other run the other half. Thus, by depressing
one pedal with the foot and raising the other, one set of threads is
depressed, and the other raised so as to admit of the woof thread being
shot across. This thread is forced home by a light beam suspended from
the roof, and then, the position of the pedals being reversed, the woof
thread is shot back again between the reversed threads of the warp. In
this way about three yards can be woven in a day.&rdquo; Further Mr. J.
D. Rees writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4135src" href=
"#xd21e4135" name="xd21e4135src">3</a> &ldquo;As you enter a
weaver&rsquo;s grove, it appears at first sight as if those occupied in
this industry were engaged in a pretty game. Rows of women walk up and
down the shady aisles, each holding aloft in the left hand a spindle,
and in the right a bamboo wand, through a hook at the end of which the
thread is passed. Alongside are split bamboos <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>reaching as high as their hips, and, as they
pass, they unwind the thread from the spindle by means of the wand, and
pass it over each alternate upright. The threads, thus separated, are
subsequently lifted with their bamboo uprights from the ground, and,
while extended from tree to tree in a horizontal position, are washed
with rice-water, and carefully brushed. The threads are now ready to be
made into cloth, and the actual weaving is carried on by means of
primitive hand looms inside the houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weavers, like many other classes in Southern India, are eminently
conservative. Even so trifling an innovation as the introduction of a
new arrangement for maintaining tension in the warp during the process
of weaving gave rise a short time ago to a temporary strike among the
hand-loom weavers at the Madras School of Arts.</p>
<p>For the following note on the weaving industry, I am indebted to Mr.
A. Chatterton. &ldquo;The hand-weavers may be divided into two great
classes&mdash;(1) plain weavers, who weave cloths or fabrics with a
single shuttle, which carries the weft from selvage to selvage; (2)
bordered cloth weavers, who weave cloths in which the threads of the
weft of the portion of the fabric forming the borders are distinct from
the threads of the weft of the main body of the cloth. To manufacture
these cloths, three shuttles are employed, and as yet no successful
attempt has been made to imitate them on the power loom. The bordered
cloth weavers do not suffer from the direct competition of machine-made
piece-goods, and the depression in their branch of the industry is due
to changes in the tastes of the people.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4145src" href="#xd21e4145" name="xd21e4145src">4</a> In the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>manufacture of a cloth from the raw material
there are three distinct processes: spinning, warping, and weaving.
Modern machinery has absolutely and completely ousted hand-spinning;
the primitive native methods of warping have been to a large extent
replaced by improved hand-machines, and power looms have displaced hand
looms to some extent; but there is still an enormous hand-loom
industry, some branches of which are in by no means an unsatisfactory
condition. In our efforts to place the hand-weaving industry on a
better footing, we are endeavouring to improve the primitive methods of
indigenous weavers both in regard to warping and weaving. In respect to
weaving we have met with considerable success, as we have demonstrated
that the output of the fly-shuttle loom is fully double that of the
native hand loom, and it is in consequence slowly making its way in the
weaving centres of Southern India. In respect to warping, no definite
solution has yet been effected, and we are still experimenting. The
problem is complicated by the fact that the output of a warping mill
must necessarily be sufficient to keep at least a hundred hand looms at
work, and at the present time the hand-weaving industry is not
organised on any basis, which gives promise of development into
co-operative working on so large a scale as would give employment to
this number of looms. In Madura, Coimbatore, Madras and Salem, attempts
are being made to establish organised hand-loom weaving factories, and
these represent the direction in which future development must take
place. At present all these factories are running with fly-shuttle
looms, and various modifications of the old types of hand-warping
machinery. The only experiments in warping and sizing are now being
conducted, at Government expense, in the Government <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>weaving factory at Salem, and in a small factory
established privately at Tondiarpet (Madras). A warping machinery,
suited to Indian requirements, has been specially designed for us in
England, and there is no doubt but that it will provide a solution to
the warping question, but whether it will be satisfactory or not
depends upon the efficiency of hank sizing. The superiority of native
cloths is commonly attributed to the fact that they are made in hand
looms, but in reality it is largely due to the methods of sizing
employed by native weavers, and it is still doubtful whether we can
attain the same results by any process which involves the production of
continuous warps of indefinite length. The ordinary native warp is
short, and it is stretched out to its full length in the street, and
the size carefully and thoroughly brushed into it. The warps which our
machines will produce may be thousands of yards in length, and, if they
are successful, will almost entirely do away with the enormous waste of
time involved in putting new warps into a loom at frequent intervals.
That they will be successful in a sense there is no reasonable doubt,
but whether the goods produced in our hand-weaving factories will be
what are now known as hand-woven goods, or whether they will partake
more of the nature of the power-loom productions, remains to be seen.
With the cheap labour available in Southern India, there is probably a
future for hand-weaving factories, but it will depend almost entirely
upon the successful training of the weavers, and experience shows that
they are not easily amenable to discipline, and have very rigid
objections to anything approaching a factory system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a speech delivered at Salem in 1906, Sir Arthur Lawley, Governor
of Madras, spoke as follows. &ldquo;I <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>know something of the
prosperity of the weaving industry in days gone by, and I regret
exceedingly to learn that it is not in so flourishing a condition as at
one time it well claimed to be. Now, we have all of us heard a good
deal of Swad&#275;shi, and the Government is being constantly urged,
from time to time, to do something to foster the industries of this
country. We made a beginning here by setting up a Weaving Institute. We
believed that by doing so we should put within the knowledge of the
weavers of this district methods whereby their output of cloth would be
greater, while the cost was reduced, and that thus their material
prosperity would be considerably advanced. Now it is somewhat of a
surprise, and considerable disappointment to me to learn that this
effort which we have made is regarded with suspicion, if not with
hostility. I am afraid our motives have been misunderstood, because I
need hardly assure you that the idea that the Government should enter
into competition with any of the industries of the country never
suggested itself to us. We desired simply and solely to infuse some
fresh spirit into an industry which was languishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the weaving industry, Mr. E. B. Havell writes
thus.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4158src" href="#xd21e4158" name=
"xd21e4158src">5</a> &ldquo;The principle of the Danish co-operative
system as applied to dairy-farming is the combination of a number of
small proprietors for sending their products to a central factory, in
which each of them has a share proportionate to the quantity of his
contributions. In the management of the factory, each member has an
absolutely equal voice, irrespective of his holdings. Adapting such a
system to the Indian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275"
name="pb275">275</a>]</span>weaving industry, each weaving community
would have a central establishment under its own control, which would
arrange the purchase of material at wholesale rates, prepare warps for
the weavers&rsquo; looms, and organise the sale of the finished
products. The actual weaving would be carried on as at present in the
weavers&rsquo; houses by the master weavers and their apprentices. If a
system of this kind would retain the economic advantages of the factory
system, and eliminate its many evils, it is obvious that a factory,
owned and controlled by the weavers themselves, and worked only for
their advantage, is a very different thing to a factory controlled by
capitalists only for the purpose of exploiting the labour of their
employees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As bearing on the general condition of the weaving community, the
following extract from the Report of the Famine in the Madras
Presidency, 1896&ndash;97, may be quoted. &ldquo;Among the people who
felt the distress at the beginning were the weavers. It is a well-known
fact that the people of the weaver castes, as well as Mussalman
weavers, are generally improvident, and consequently poor. In
favourable times, the weavers generally earn fair wages. They, however,
spend all they earn without caring to lay by anything, so that very few
of their caste are in well-to-do circumstances. The same is the case
with the Mussalman weavers. All these weavers are entirely in the hands
of the sowcars (money-lenders), who make advances to them, and get
cloths in return. The cloths thus obtained by the sowcars are exported
to other parts of the country. It may be taken as a general fact that
most of the professional weavers are indebted to the sowcars, and are
bound to weave for them. So long as the seasons are favourable, and
sowcars get indents for cloths from their customers, they continue
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>their advances to their dependent weavers. But
when, owing to any cause, the demand decreases, the sowcars curtail
their advances proportionately, and the weavers are at once put to
difficulty. According to the fineness and kind of fabrics turned out by
the weavers, they may be divided into fine cloth weavers and silk
weavers, and weavers of coarse cloths. It is the coarse cloth weavers
that would be affected with the first appearance of distress. The
consumers of their manufactures are the poorer classes, and, with the
appearance of scarcity and high prices, the demand for the coarser
kinds of cloths would cease. Such was actually the case at the
beginning of the recent distress. The weavers are, as a class, not
accustomed to hard manual labour, nor are they able to work exposed to
heat and sun. If such people are put on earth-work, they would
certainly fail to turn out the prescribed task, and consequently earn
insufficient wages. They would thus be, as it were, punished for no
fault of theirs. This state of things would last at least for some
time, until the weavers got accustomed to earth-work. Again, these
people have, by constant work at their own craft, attained to a certain
degree of skill and delicacy, and, if compelled to do earth-work during
the temporary unfavourable season, they would certainly lose, to some
extent, their skill and delicacy of hand, and would become unfit, in
that degree, for their accustomed work when favourable season returns.
They would thus be put to inconvenience doubly. During the first part
of the distress, their skill of hand, and delicacy of constitution
would stand in their way, and, after the return of good season, the
loss of manual skill and delicacy would place them at a disadvantage.
It can be easily seen that giving relief to the weavers in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>their own calling is the most economical form of
relief. In this form of special relief, Government advances materials
to the weavers to be woven into different kinds of cloths. Government
has no doubt to incur a large initial expenditure in the shape of value
of materials, and wages for weavers for making these materials into
cloths. But all the materials are returned woven into cloths, so that,
at the close of the operations, Government has a stock of cloths, which
can be disposed of without difficulty on the return of favourable
times, and the cost incurred recovered. In this way, Government not
only administers relief to a pretty large section of its poor subjects,
but keeps up, with little or no cost to itself, the industrial skill of
this section of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of proverbs relating to the weaver, one runs to the effect that,
&ldquo;if you want to narrow the breadth of a river, you should plant
reeds on its margin; and, if you desire to destroy the sanitation of a
village, you should bring weavers to it, and settle them there.&rdquo;
When the dyes have to be fixed, and the dyed twist has to be washed,
the weavers generally resort to running water, and pollute it. The
several processes of twisting and untwisting threads, preparing skeins,
etc., make combined labour a necessity in the weaving industry; and,
wherever one finds a weaver settlement, he must find there a large
number of these people, as is explained by the proverb that &ldquo;the
Chetti (merchant) lost by partnership, while the weaver came to grief
by isolation.&rdquo; When plying shuttles in the weaving process, the
weavers always use their feet in shifting the warp, by treading on a
press. Thus, if a weaver unfortunately happens to have a sore on his
foot, it means loss to him; or, as the proverb says, &ldquo;If a dog
gets a sore on its head, it never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278"
href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>recovers from it; and even so
a weaver who gets a sore on his foot.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p><b>Salige</b> (wire).&mdash;A g&#333;tra of Kurni.</p>
<p><b>S&#257;liyan.&mdash;</b>The S&#257;liyan weavers of Korn&#257;d
and Ayyampet, in the Tanjore district, are a Tamil-speaking class, who
must not be confused with the Telugu S&#257;l&#275;s. They afford an
interesting example of how a limited number of families, following the
same occupation, can crystallise into a separate caste. They claim to
have a Pur&#257;nam relating to their origin, which is said to be found
in the Sthalapur&#257;nam of the Nall&#257;dai temple. They believe
that they are the descendants of one S&#257;liya Mah&#257; Rishi, a
low-caste man, who did service for one Vis&#257;kar, who was doing
penance near Nall&#257;dai. Through the grace of the rishi
Vis&#257;kar, S&#257;liya became a rishi, and married two wives. The
S&#257;liyans are said to be descended from the offspring of the first
wife, and the Mottai S&#257;liyans from the offspring of the
second.</p>
<p>The S&#257;liyans have taken to wearing the sacred thread, engage
Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hits, and are guided by Br&#257;hman priests.
They are said to have had their own caste priests until a Br&#257;hman
from Sendangudi, near May&#257;varam, accepted the office of priest. It
is reported that, in former days, the S&#257;liyans were not allowed to
sell their goods except in a fixed spot called
m&#257;maraththum&#275;du, where they set out their cloths on bamboos.
High-caste people never touched the cloths, except with a stick. At the
present day the S&#257;liyans occupy a good position in the social
scale, and employ Br&#257;hman cooks, though no other castes will eat
in their houses.</p>
<p>A curious feature in connection with the S&#257;liyans is that,
contrary to the usual rule among Tamil castes, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>they

<p>The S&#257;liyans have further acquired g&#333;tras named after

<p>The S&#257;liyan weavers of silk Korn&#257;d women&rsquo;s cloths,
who have settled at May&#257;varam in the Tanjore district, neither
intermarry nor interdine with the S&#257;liyans of the Tinnevelly
district, though they belong to the same linguistic division. The
Tinnevelly S&#257;liyans closely follow the Kaik&#333;lans in their
various ceremonials, and in their social organisation, and interdine
with them. S&#257;liya women wear three armlets on the upper arm,
whereas Kaik&#333;la women only wear a single armlet. The S&#257;liyans
may not marry a second wife during the lifetime of the first wife, even
if she does not bear children. They may, however, adopt children. Some
of the Tinnevelly S&#257;liyans have taken to trade and agriculture,
while others weave coarse cotton cloths, and dye cotton yarn.

<p>In the Census Report, 1901, Ataviyar is recorded as &ldquo;a synonym
for, or rather title of the Tinnevelly S&#257;l&#275;s.&rdquo; Further,
Patt&#257;riyar is described as a Tamil corruption of Pattu
S&#257;liyan, returned by some of the Tinnevelly S&#257;l&#275;s. The
Adaviyar or Pattalia Settis are Tamilians, probably an offshoot of the
Kaik&#333;lans, and have no connection with the Telugu Pattu
S&#257;l&#275;s, who, like the Padma S&#257;l&#275;s, retain their
mother-tongue wherever they settle. It is recorded<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4253src" href="#xd21e4253" name="xd21e4253src">7</a> in
connection with the S&#257;liyar of the Chingleput district, many of
whom are Kaik&#333;lans, that &ldquo;a story is current of their
persecution by one Salva Naik (said to have been a Br&#257;hman). The
result of this was that large bodies of them were forced to flee from
Conjeeveram to Madura, Tanjore, and Tinnevelly, where their
representatives are still to be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Adaviyars follow the Tamil Pur&#257;nic type of marriage
ceremonies, and have a sirut&#257;li (small t&#257;li) as a marriage
badge. The caste deity is Mukth&#257;kshiamman. The dead are always
cremated.</p>

in the South Canara district. They are divided into two endogamous
groups, the Canarese Samag&#257;ras and the &#256;rya Samag&#257;ras.
The latter speak Mar&#257;thi. Though the Samag&#257;ras are in the
general estimation as low a caste as the Holeyas, and do not materially
differ from them in their religious and other ceremonies and customs,
they are, as a rule, of much fairer complexion, and the women are often
very handsome. The tanning industry <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

by the Samag&#257;ras, and their <i>modus operandi</i> is as follows.
The hides are soaked for a period of one month in large earthen vats
containing water, to which chunam is added at the rate of two seers per
hide. After the expiry of the above period, they are soaked in fresh
water for three days, in view to the chunam being removed. They are
then put into an earthen vessel filled with water and the leaves of
<i>Phyllanthus Emblica</i>, in which they remain for twelve days. After
this, they are removed and squeezed, and replaced in the same vessel,
where they are allowed to remain for about a month, after which period
they are again removed, washed and squeezed. They are then sewn up and
stuffed with the bark of cashew, daddala, and neral&#275; trees, and
hung up for a day. After this, the stitching is removed, and the hides
are washed and exposed to the sun to dry for a day, when they become
fit for making sandals. Some of the hides rot in this process to such
an extent as to become utterly unfit for use.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>S&#257;mantan.&mdash;</b>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; the Census
Superintendent, 1891, writes, &ldquo;may be called the caste of
Malay&#257;lam R&#257;jahs and chieftains, but it is hardly a separate
caste at all, at any rate at present, for those N&#257;yars and others
who have at any time been petty chieftains in the country, call
themselves S&#257;mantas. The primary meaning of the word S&#257;manta
is given by Dr. Gundert<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4289src" href=
"#xd21e4289" name="xd21e4289src">10</a> as the chief of a
district.&rdquo; The number of people who returned themselves as
S&#257;mantas (including a few S&#257;mantan Br&#257;hmans)
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=

increased to 4,351.</p>
<p>In a suit brought against the Collector of Malabar (Mr. Logan) some
years ago by one Nilamb&#363;r Thachara K&#333;vil Mana Vikrama,
<i>alias</i> Elaya Tirumalp&#257;d, the plaintiff entered an objection
to his being said by the Collector to be of &ldquo;a caste
(N&#257;yar), who are permitted to eat fish and flesh, except of course
beef.&rdquo; He stated in court that he was &ldquo;a S&#257;mantan by
caste, and a S&#257;mantan is neither a Br&#257;hman, nor a Kshatriya,
nor a Vaisya, nor a S&#363;dra.&rdquo; S&#257;mantan, according to him,
is a corruption of S&#257;mantran, which, he stated, meant one who
performs ceremonies without mantrams. He said that his caste observes
all the ceremonies that Br&#257;hmans do, but without mantrams. And he
gave the following as the main points in which his caste differs from
that of the N&#257;yars. Br&#257;hmans can take their food in the
houses of members of his caste, while they cannot do so in those of
N&#257;yars. At the performance of sr&#257;dhs in his caste,
Br&#257;hmans are fed, while this is not done in the case of
N&#257;yars. Br&#257;hmans can prepare water for the purpose of
purification in his house, but not in that of a N&#257;yar. If a
N&#257;yar touches a S&#257;mantan, he has to bathe in the same way as
a Br&#257;hman would have to do. For the performance of marriages and
other ceremonies in his caste, Malabar Br&#257;hmans are absolutely
necessary. At marriages the t&#257;li is tied by Kshatriyas. A
S&#257;mantan has fourteen days&rsquo; pollution, while a N&#257;yar
has fifteen. He can only eat what a Br&#257;hman can eat. He added that
he was of the same caste as the Zamorin of Calicut. A number of
witnesses, including the author of the K&#275;ralavakhsha Kramam, were
examined in support of his assertions. It was noted by the District
Judge that no documentary evidence was produced, or reference to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>public records or works of authority made in
support of the theory as to the existence of a caste of S&#257;mantas
who are not N&#257;yars, and are classed under Kshatriyas, and above
the Vaisyas. The following account is given by the author of the
K&#275;ralavakhsha Kramam of the origin of the S&#257;mantas. Some
Kshatriyas who, being afraid of Parasu R&#257;ma, were wandering in
foreign parts, and not observing caste rules, came to Malabar, visited
Ch&#275;raman Perum&#257;l, and asked for his protection. On this
Ch&#275;raman Perum&#257;l, with the sanction of the Br&#257;hmans, and
in pursuance of the rules laid down by the Mahar&#257;jas who had
preceded him, classed these people as members of the S&#257;mantra
caste. &ldquo;That this book,&rdquo; the Judge observed, &ldquo;can be
looked on as being in any way an authority on difficult and obscure
historical questions, or that the story can be classed as more than a
myth, there are no grounds for supposing.&rdquo; No linguistic work of
recognised authority was produced in support of the derivation of the
word S&#257;mantan from S&#257;mantran, meaning without mantrams.</p>
<p>One exhibit in the case above referred to was an extract from the
report of a commission appointed to inspect the state and condition of
the province of Malabar. It is dated 11th October, 1793, and in it
allusion is made to the &lsquo;Tichera Tiroopaar&rsquo; who is
described as a chief N&#257;yar of Nilamb&#363;r in the southern
division of the country. Evidence was given to show that Tichera
Tiroopaar is the Nilamb&#363;r Tirumulp&#257;d. And, in a letter from
the Supervisor of Malabar, dated 15th November, 1793, allusion is made
to Tichera Tiroopaar as a N&#257;yar. Two extracts from
Buchanan&rsquo;s well-known work on Mysore, Canara and Malabar, were
also filed as exhibits. In one Buchanan relates what was told him by
the Br&#257;hmans of the history of &lsquo;Malay&#257;la&rsquo;.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>Among other things, he mentions that
Ch&#275;raman Perum&#257;l, having come to the resolution of retiring
to Mecca, went to Calicut. &ldquo;He was there met by a N&#257;yar who
was a gallant chief, but who, having been absent at the division, had
obtained no share of his master&rsquo;s dominions. Ch&#275;raman
Perum&#257;l thereupon gave him his sword, and desired him to keep all
that he could conquer. From this person&rsquo;s sisters are descended
the Tamuri Rajahs or Zamorins.&rdquo; In the second extract, Buchanan
sums up the result of enquiries that he had made concerning the Zamorin
and his family. He states that the head of the family is the Tamuri
Rajah, called by Europeans the Zamorin, and adds: &ldquo;The Tamuri
pretends to be of a higher rank than the Br&#257;hmans, and to be
inferior only to the invisible gods, a pretension that was acknowledged
by his subjects, but which is held as absurd and abominable by the
Br&#257;hmans, by whom he is only treated as a S&#363;dra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An important witness said that he knew the plaintiff, and that he
was a S&#363;dra. He stated that he had lived for two years in the
Zamorin&rsquo;s k&#333;vilagom, and knew the customs of his family.
According to him there was no difference between his own caste customs
and those of the Zamorin. He said that S&#257;mantan means a petty
chieftain, and drew attention to the &lsquo;Sukra Niti,&rsquo; edited
by Dr. Oppert, where a S&#257;mantan is said to be &ldquo;he who gets
annually a revenue of from one to three lakhs karshom from his subjects
without oppressing them.&rdquo; There are, according to him, some
N&#257;yars who call themselves S&#257;mantas, and he added that when,
in 1887, the Collector of Malabar called for lists of all
stanom-holders<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4309src" href="#xd21e4309"
name="xd21e4309src">11</a> in the district, he examined these lists,
and found that some of the N&#257;yar chiefs called themselves
S&#257;mantan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;A consideration of all the evidence,&rdquo; the Judge writes,
&ldquo;appears to me to prove conclusively that the plaintiff is a
N&#257;yar by caste.... What appears to me, from a consideration of the
evidence, to be the safe inference to draw is that the members of the
plaintiff&rsquo;s family, and also the descendants of certain other of
the old N&#257;yar chieftains, have for some time called themselves,
and been called by others, S&#257;mantas, but that there is no
distinctive caste of that name, and that the plaintiff is, as the
defendant has described him, a N&#257;yar by caste.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4315src" href="#xd21e4315" name=
"xd21e4315src">12</a></p>
<p>The S&#257;mantans are summed up as follows in the Gazetteer of
Malabar. &ldquo;S&#257;mantan is the generic name of the group of
castes forming the aristocracy of Malabar, and it includes the
following divisions:&mdash;Nambiy&#257;r, Unnitiri, Adiy&#333;di, all
belonging to North Malabar; and Nedung&#257;di, Vall&#333;di,
&#274;r&#257;di, and Tirumulp&#257;d, all belonging to South Malabar.
There are also N&#257;yars with the title of Nambiyar and Adiy&#333;di.
Nedung&#257;di, Vall&#333;di and &#274;r&#257;di, are territorial names
applied to the S&#257;mantans indigenous to &#274;rn&#257;d,
Walavan&#257;d, and Nedungan&#257;d respectively; or perhaps it may be
more correct to say that the tracts in question take their names from
the ruling classes, who formerly bore sway there. &#274;r&#257;di is
the caste to which belongs the Z&#257;morin R&#257;ja of Calicut. It is
also the name of a section of Kiriyattil N&#257;yars. The R&#257;ja of
Walavan&#257;d is a Vall&#333;di. Tirumulp&#257;d is the title of a
class of S&#257;mantans, to which belong a number of petty chieftains,
such as the Karnamulp&#257;d of Manjeri and the Tirumulp&#257;d of
Nilamb&#363;r. The ladies of this class are called Kolp&#257;ds or
Koilamm&#257;hs. Many Nambiy&#257;rs in North Malabar claim to belong
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>the S&#257;mantan caste, but there is at least
reason to suppose that they are properly N&#257;yars, and that the
claim to the higher rank is of recent date. That such recruitment is
going on is indicated by the difference between the number of persons
returned as S&#257;mantans in the censuses of 1901 and 1891 (4,351 and
1,225 respectively), which is far above the normal percentage of
increase of population. Kshatriyas wear the p&#363;n&#363;l (thread);
S&#257;mantans as a rule do not. Most Kshatriyas eat with
Br&#257;hmans, and have a pollution period of eleven nights, indicating
that their position in the caste hierarchy lies between the
Br&#257;hmans with ten days and the Ambalav&#257;sis proper with
twelve. S&#257;mantans as a rule observe fifteen days&rsquo; pollution,
and may not eat with Br&#257;hmans. Both follow marumakkat&#257;yam
(inheritance in the female line), and their women as a rule have
sambandham (alliance) only with Br&#257;hmans or Kshatriyas. Those who
belong to the old Royal families are styled R&#257;ja or Tambur&#257;n
(lord), their ladies Tambur&#257;ttis, and their houses K&#333;vilagams
or palaces. Some S&#257;mantans have the caste titles of Kart&#257;vu
and Kaimal. But it does not appear that there are really any material
differences between the various classes of S&#257;mantans, other than
purely social differences due to their relative wealth and
influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tradition,&rdquo; writes the Travancore Census Superintendent
(1901), &ldquo;traces the S&#257;mantas to the prudent Kshatriyas, who
cast off the holy thread, to escape detection and slaughter by Parasu
R&#257;ma. They are believed to have then fled to uninhabited forests
till they forgot the Sandhy&#257;vandana prayers, and became in certain
respects no better than S&#363;dras. Thus they came, it is said, to be
called Amantrakas, S&#257;mantrakas, S&#257;mantas, or having no mantra
at all. Referring to this, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href=
"#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>Mr. Stuart says<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4327src" href="#xd21e4327" name="xd21e4327src">13</a>
&lsquo;Neither philology, nor anything else, supports this
fable.&rsquo; From the word S&#257;mantra, S&#257;manta can, no doubt,
be conveniently derived, but, if they could not repeat mantras, they
should have been called Amantras and not S&#257;mantras. In the
K&#275;rala M&#257;hatmya we read that the Perum&#257;ls appointed
S&#257;mantas to rule over portions of their kingdom. Taking the
Sanskrit word S&#257;manta, we may understand it to mean a petty chief
or ruler. It is supposed that the Perum&#257;ls who came to Malabar
contracted matrimonial alliances with high class N&#257;yar women, and
that the issue of such unions were given chiefships over various
extents of territories. Changes in their manners and customs were, it
is said, made subsequently, by way of approximation to the Kshatriyas
proper. Though the sacred thread, and the G&#257;yatri hymn were never
taken up, less vital changes, as, for instance, that of the wearing of
the ornaments of the Kshatriya women, or of consorting only with
Namb&#363;tiri husbands, were adopted. Those who lived in Ern&#257;t
formed themselves by connections and alliances into one large caste,
and called themselves Er&#257;tis. Those who lived in Valluvan&#257;t
became Vall&#333;tis. The unification could not assume a more
cosmopolitan character as the several families rose to importance at
different times, and, in all probability, from different sections of
the N&#257;yars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Travancore Census Report (1901) the chief divisions of the
S&#257;mantas are said to be Atiy&#333;ti, Uny&#257;tiri, Pant&#257;la,
Er&#257;ti, Vall&#333;ti, and Netung&#257;ti. &ldquo;The
Uny&#257;tiris,&rdquo; the Travancore Census Superintendent writes
further, &ldquo;look upon themselves as a higher class than the rest of
the S&#257;mantas, as they have an &#256;ryapattar to tie the t&#257;li
of their girls, the other five castes employing only <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>Kshatriyas (Tirumulp&#257;ts) for that duty. The
word Atiy&#333;ti has sometimes been derived from Atiy&#257;n, a slave
or vassal, the tradition being that the Kattanat R&#257;ja, having once
been ousted from his kingdom by the Zamorin of Calicut, sought the
assistance of the R&#257;ja of Chirakkal. The latter is believed to
have made the Kattanat R&#257;ja his vassal as a condition for his
territory being restored. The Unnittiris are not found in Travancore,
their place being taken by the Uny&#257;tiris, who do not differ from
them materially in any of their manners and customs. The word Unnittiri
means the venerable boy, and is merely a title of dignity. The word
Pant&#257;la comes from Bhand&#257;rattil, meaning &lsquo;in or
belonging to the royal treasury&rsquo;. They appear to have been once
the ruling chiefs of small territories. Their women are known as
K&#333;vilammam&#257;r, <i>i.e.</i>, the ladies of palaces or
r&#257;nis. The Er&#257;ti, the Vall&#333;ti, and Netung&#257;ti are
British Malabar castes, and receive their names from the localities, to
which they may have been indigenous&mdash;Ern&#257;t, Valluvan&#257;t,
and Netung&#257;n&#257;t. The Zamorin of Calicut is an Er&#257;ti by
caste. [In 1792, the Joint Commissioners wrote that &lsquo;the
Cartinaad and Samoory (the principal families in point of extent of
dominion) are of the Samanth or Euree (cowherd) caste.&rsquo;]<a class=

"xd21e4337src">14</a> Some of these Er&#257;tis, such as the R&#257;ja
of Nilamb&#363;r, are called Tirumulp&#257;ts. The only peculiarity
with these Tirumulp&#257;ts is that they may tie the t&#257;li of their
women, and need not call other Tirumulp&#257;ts for the purpose, as the
rest of the S&#257;mantas have to do. A title that several
S&#257;mantas often take is Kart&#257;vu (agent or doer), their females
being called Koilp&#257;ts, meaning literally those who live in
palaces. The S&#257;mantas of Manch&#275;ry and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>Amarampalam in Malabar are also called
Tirumulp&#257;ts. The S&#257;mantas of Chuntampattai and
Cherupul&#257;ss&#275;ri are called Kart&#257;vus. Both Kartas and
Tirumulp&#257;ts are called by the S&#363;dra castes Tampur&#257;n or
prince. The caste government of the S&#257;mantas rests with the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e4344" title=
"Source: Namputiri">Namp&#363;tiri</span> Vaidikas, and their
priesthood is undertaken by the Namp&#363;tiris. They follow the
marumakkathayam law of inheritance (through the female line), and
observe both the forms of marriage in vogue in the country, namely,
t&#257;li-kettu and sambandham. Women wear the three special ornaments
of the Kshatriyas, viz., the mittil or cherut&#257;li, entram, and
kuzhal. The chief of these is the mittil, which is used as the wedding
ornament. It has the appearance of R&#257;ma&rsquo;s parasu or
battle-axe. The houses of those S&#257;mantas, who are or were till
recently rulers of territories, are known as kott&#257;rams or palaces,
while those of the commonalty are merely called mathams, a name given
to the houses of Br&#257;hmans not indigenous to Malabar. The
occupations, which the S&#257;mantas pursue, are chiefly personal
attendance on the male and female members of Royal families. Others are
landlords, and a few have taken to the learned professions.&rdquo; In
the Cochin Census Report, 1901, it is stated that &ldquo;S&#257;mantas
and Ambalav&#257;sis do not interdine. At public feasts they sit
together for meals. Br&#257;hmans, Kshatriyas, Nampidis, and most of
the Ambalav&#257;si castes, do not take water from them. Birth and
death pollution last for eleven days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Madras Civil List of titles and title-holders, the Zamorin of
Calicut, and the Valiya R&#257;jas of Chirakkal, Kadattan&#257;d,
Palgh&#257;t, and Waluvan&#257;d, are returned as S&#257;mantas.</p>
<p><b>S&#257;manthi</b> (<i>Chrysanthemum indicum</i>).&mdash;An
exogamous sept of Kuruba and Togata. The flowers of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>chrysanthemum are largely used for garlands,
etc., in temple worship.</p>
<p><b>S&#257;mantiya.&mdash;</b>The S&#257;mantiyas are an Oriya caste
of agricultural labourers and firewood sellers. It has been suggested
that the caste name is derived from samantiba, which denotes sauntering
to pick up scattered things. The S&#257;mantiyas are one of the castes,
whose touch is supposed to convey pollution, and they consequently live
apart in separate quarters.</p>
<p>All the S&#257;mantiyas are said to belong to the n&#257;gasa
(cobra) g&#333;tra. The headman is called B&#275;hara, and he is
assisted by an official called Poricha. There is also a caste servant
entitled Dogara. The caste title is Podh&#257;no, which is also
frequently given out as being the name of the caste.</p>
<p>S&#257;mantiya women will not eat food prepared by Br&#257;hmans or
members of other castes, and they apparently object to cooking in open
places when travelling, and leave this work for the men to perform. An
Oriya Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit officiates at the marriage ceremonies,
which, with slight variations, conform to the standard Oriya type. The
marriage pandal (booth) is generally covered with cocoanut leaves and
leafy twigs of <i>Eugenia Jambolana</i> and <i>Zizyphus Jujuba</i>.
Four lights, and a vessel of water, are kept on the dais throughout the
marriage ceremonies. The knot, with which the cloths of the bride and
bridegroom are tied together, is untied on the evening of the bibha
(wedding) day, instead of on the seventh day as among many other
castes.</p>
<p><b>S&#257;manto.&mdash;</b>A title of J&#257;tapus, and other Oriya
castes.</p>
<p><b>Samaya.&mdash;</b>In his &lsquo;Inscriptions at Sravana
Belgola&rsquo; in Mysore, Mr. Lewis Rice refers to the Samaya as
&ldquo;D&#257;saris or Vaishnava religious mendicants, invested
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>with authority as censors of morals. No
religious ceremony or marriage could be undertaken without gaining
their consent by the payment of fees, etc. Under the former R&#257;jas
the office was farmed out in all the large towns, and credited in the
public accounts as samay&#257;ch&#257;ra. An important part of the
profits arose either from the sale of women accused of incontinency, or
from fines imposed on them for the same reason. The unfortunate women
were popularly known as Sarkar (Government) wives.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
rules of the system,&rdquo; Wilks writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4382src" href="#xd21e4382" name="xd21e4382src">15</a>
&ldquo;varied according to the caste of the accused. Among
Br&#257;hmans and K&#333;matis, females were not sold, but expelled
from their caste, and branded on the arm as prostitutes. They then paid
to the ij&#257;rd&#257;r (or contractor) an annual sum as long as they
lived, and, when they died, all their property became his. Females of
other Hindu castes were sold without any compunction by the
ij&#257;rd&#257;r, unless some relative stepped forward to satisfy his
demand. These sales were not, as might be supposed, conducted by
stealth, nor confined to places remote from general observation; for,
in the large town of Bangalore, under the very eyes of the European
inhabitants, a large building was appropriated to the accommodation of
these unfortunate women, and, so late as 1833, a distinct proclamation
of the Commissioners was necessary to enforce the abolition of this
detestable traffic.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Samayamuv&#257;ru.&mdash;</b>An itinerant class of mendicants
attached to the S&#257;l&#275; caste. From a note by Mr. C. Hayavadana
Rao, I gather that they say that the name is an abbreviation of
R&#257;nasamayamuv&#257;ru, or men of the day of battle. According to a
legend, when Bh&#257;vana <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href=
"#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>Rishi, the patron saint of the
caste, was challenged to battle by K&#257;lavas&#299;na, a
r&#257;kshasa, these people were created, and, with their assistance,
the r&#257;kshasa was conquered. In recognition of their services,
Bh&#257;vana Rishi made the S&#257;l&#275;s maintain them. They wander
from place to place in single families, and, when they reach a
halting-place, dress up, and visit the house of the Pedda
S&#275;n&#257;pati (headman), who feeds them for the day, and gives a
chit (note) showing the amount paid by him. At their visits to
S&#257;l&#275; houses, Bh&#257;vana Rishi is praised. They marry in the
presence of, and with the aid of the S&#257;l&#275;s.</p>
<p><b>S&#257;mban.&mdash;</b>S&#257;mban, meaning S&#257;mba or Siva,
has been recorded as a sub-division of Idaiyan and Paraiyan. At times
of census, S&#257;mbuni K&#257;pu has been returned as the caste name
by some Palle fishermen in Nellore.</p>
<p><b>Sambandham.&mdash;</b>Sambandham, meaning literally connexion, is
&ldquo;the term used by the N&#257;yars [and other castes] of South
Malabar to denote that a man and woman are united by a
<i>quasi</i>-matrimonial bond.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4403src" href="#xd21e4403" name="xd21e4403src">16</a> In Act IV

cohabit or intend to cohabit as husband and wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Samm&#275;r&#257;ya.&mdash;</b>A name for Telugu beggars employed
as servants and messengers by the heads of Ling&#257;yat mutts
(religious institutions). It is derived from samm&#275;, denoting
confederacy or league, and denotes those who are bound to the rules
laid down by Ling&#257;yats.</p>
<p><b>S&#257;molo.&mdash;</b>A title of Doluva.</p>
<p><b>Sampig&#275;.&mdash;</b>Sampig&#275; and Sampangi (champac:
<i>Michelia Champaca</i>) have been recorded as an exogamous sept of
Kurni and Odd&#275;. Champac flowers are used in the manufacture of
temple garlands.</p>
<p><b>Samudra.&mdash;</b>Samudra, Samudram, or Samudrala, meaning the
ocean, has been recorded as an exogamous sept of Telugu Br&#257;hmans,
Koravas, Kurubas, Balijas, and M&#257;las. The equivalent Tamudri
occurs as the title of the Zamorin, who is the sea-king or ruler of
Calicut.</p>
<p><b>S&#257;ni.&mdash;</b>The S&#257;niv&#257;llu, who are a Telugu
dancing-girl caste, are described, in the Vizagapatam Manual, as women
who have not entered into matrimony, gain money by prostitution, and
acting as dancers at feasts. S&#257;ni is also a title of the Oriya
Doluvas in Ganjam, who are said to be descended from Puri R&#257;jas by
their concubines. The streets occupied by S&#257;nis are, in Ganjam,
known as S&#257;ni v&#299;dhi. I have heard of missionaries, who, in
consequence of this name, insist on their wives being addressed as
Amm&#257;garu instead of by the customary name Doras&#257;ni.</p>
<p>In a note on the S&#257;nis of the God&#257;vari district, Mr. F. R.
Hemingway writes as follows. &ldquo;In this district, dancing-girls and
prostitutes are made up of six perfectly distinct castes, which are in
danger of being confused. These are the S&#257;nis proper, B&#333;gams,
Dommara S&#257;nis, Turaka S&#257;nis, Mangala B&#333;gams, and
M&#257;diga B&#333;gams. Of these, the B&#333;gams claim to be
superior, and will not dance in the presence of, or after <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>a
performance by any of the others. The S&#257;nis do not admit this
claim, but they do not mind dancing after the B&#333;gams, or in their
presence. All the other classes are admittedly inferior to the
S&#257;nis and the B&#333;gams. The S&#257;nis would scorn to eat with
any of the other dancing castes. The S&#257;ni women are not
exclusively devoted to their traditional profession. Some of them marry
male members of the caste, and live respectably with them. The men do
not, as among the dancing castes of the south, assist in the dancing,
or by playing the accompaniments or forming a chorus, but are
cultivators and petty traders. Like the dancing-girls of the south, the
S&#257;nis keep up their numbers by the adoption of girls of other
castes. They do service in the temples, but they are not required to be
formally dedicated or married to the god, as in the Tamil country.
Those of them who are to become prostitutes are usually married to a
sword on attaining puberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>S&#257;ni, meaning apparently cow-dung, occurs as a sub-division of
the Tamil Agamudaiyans.</p>
<p><b>Sanj&#333;gi.&mdash;</b>The Sanj&#333;gis are an Oriya class of
religious mendicants, who wear the sacred thread, and act as priests
for P&#257;nos and other lowly people. The name indicates connection,
and that they are the connecting link between ordinary people and those
who have given up earthly pleasures (Sany&#257;sis). The Sanj&#333;gis
follow the ordinary as well as the ascetic life. Mr. G. Ramamurti
Pantulu informs me that they are believed to be the offspring of
ascetics who have violated their vow of celibacy, and women with whom
they have lived. They make and sell bead rosaries of the sacred tulsi
or basil (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ocimum sanctum</i>) which are worn by
various Oriya castes. Some are cultivators, while others are beggars. A
Sanj&#333;gi beggar goes about with a bell <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>on
the thigh, and a coloured pot on the left shoulder. A few are employed
at Oriya maths (religious institutions), where it is their duty to
invite Bair&#257;gis and ascetics to a dinner party, and afterwards to
remove the leaf platters, and eat the food which is left.</p>
<p><b>Sank&#257;ti</b> (r&#257;gi or millet pudding).&mdash;An
exogamous sept of B&#333;ya. R&#257;gi is the staple dietary of many of
the lower classes, who cannot afford rice.</p>
<p><b>Sanku.&mdash;</b>Sanku, the conch or chank (<i>Turbinella
rapa</i>) has been recorded as a sub-division of D&#257;saris, Koppala
Velamas, and Paraiyans who act as conch-blowers at funerals, and as an
exogamous sept of Kuruba. Sankukatti, or those who tie the chank,
occurs as a sub-division of Idaiyan. The chank shell, which is
regularly collected by divers off Tuticorin in the Tinnevelly district,
is highly prized by Hindus, and used for offering libations, and as a
musical instrument at temple services, marriages, and other
ceremonials. Vaishnavites and M&#257;dhvas are branded with the emblems
of the chank and chakram. The rare right-handed chank shell is
specially valued, and purchased for large sums. A legend, recorded by
Bald&aelig;us, runs to the effect that &ldquo;Garroude (Garuda) flew in
all haste to Brahma, and brought to Kistna the chianko or kinkhorn
twisted to the right&rdquo;. Such a shell appears on the coat-of-arms
of the R&#257;ja of Cochin and on the coins of Travancore.</p>
<p><b>Sanno</b> (little).&mdash;A sub-division of Bottada, Omanaito,
Pentiya, and Sondi.</p>
<p><b>Sanror.&mdash;</b>A synonym of Sh&#257;n&#257;ns, who claim that
Sh&#257;n&#257;n is derived from S&#257;nr&#333;r, meaning the learned
or noble.</p>
<p><b>Sant&#257;rasi.&mdash;</b>An exogamous sept of Dand&#257;si. The
members thereof may not use mats made of the sedge of this name.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=

<p><b>Santha</b> (a fair).&mdash;An exogamous sept of D&#275;v&#257;nga
and Odd&#275;.</p>
<p><b>S&#257;nto.&mdash;</b>A sub-division of Oriya Br&#257;hmans and
Bh&#257;yipuos.</p>
<p><b>Sany&#257;si.&mdash;</b>&ldquo;A Sany&#257;si is literally a man
who has forsaken all, and who has renounced the world and leads a life
of celibacy, devoting himself to religious meditation and abstraction,
and to the study of holy books. He is considered to have attained a
state of exalted piety that places him above most of the restrictions
of caste and ceremony. His is the fourth &#256;srama or final stage of
life recommended for the three higher orders. [&ldquo;Having performed
religious acts in a forest during the third portion of his life, let
him become a Sany&#257;si, for the fourth portion of it, abandoning all
sensual affection.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4497src" href=
"#xd21e4497" name="xd21e4497src">17</a>] The number of Br&#257;hman
Sany&#257;sis is very small; they are chiefly the Gurus or High Priests
of the different sects. These are, as a rule, men of learning, and
heads of monasteries, where they have a number of disciples under
instruction and training for religious discussion. They are supported
entirely by endowments and the contributions of their disciples. They
undertake periodical tours for the purpose of receiving the offerings
of their followers. Since the Sany&#257;si is considered to be above
all sin, and to have acquired sufficient merit for salvation, no
sr&#257;dha is performed by the children born to him before he became
an anchorite. [The skull of a Sany&#257;si is broken after death, as a
guarantee of his passage to eternal bliss. <i>Cf</i>.
G&#333;s&#257;yi.] The corpse of a Sany&#257;si is buried, and never
burnt, or thrown into the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The majority of the Sany&#257;sis found, and generally known
as such, are a class of S&#363;dra devotees, who live <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>by
begging, and pretend to powers of divination. They wear garments
coloured with red ochre, and allow the hair to grow unshorn. They often
have settled abodes, but itinerate. Many are married, and their
descendants keep up the sect, and follow the same
calling.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4507src" href="#xd21e4507"

<p><b>Sapiri.&mdash;</b>A synonym of Relli.</p>
<p><b>Sappaliga.&mdash;</b>It is noted, in the Madras Census Report,
1901, that &ldquo;in some t&#257;luks of South Canara they are said to
be identical with, or a sub-caste of G&#257;niga.&rdquo; The
G&#257;nigas are a Canarese caste, of which the traditional occupation
is oil-pressing. In the Manual of the South Canara district, it is
recorded that &ldquo;Sappaligs appear to be identical with the
D&#275;v&#257;digas (temple musicians) in North Canara, though they are
regarded as distinct castes in South Canara. The Sappaligs are, as the
name sappal (noise) implies, a class of musicians in temples, but a
number of them are cultivators.&rdquo; Sappaliga is an occupational
term. The musicians among the Tulu Mog&#275;r fishing caste are called
Sappaligas, in the same way that those Mog&#275;rs who are engaged as
oil-pressers are called G&#257;nigas, both being occupational
names.</p>

<p><b>S&#257;stri.&mdash;</b>In the Madras Census Report, 1901,
S&#257;stri (one learned in the sh&#257;stras) is described as
&ldquo;unrecognizable. The word is used as a title by Smarta
Br&#257;hmans in the Madras Presidency, but the persons returning it
came from Bombay, and were not Br&#257;hmans.&rdquo; S&#257;stri is
recorded in my notes as a title of D&#275;v&#257;ngas.</p>
<p><b>S&#257;t&#257;ni.&mdash;</b>The S&#257;t&#257;nis are described
in the Madras Census Report, 1891, as &ldquo;a class of temple servants
very much like the M&#257;lis of Bengal. The word S&#257;t&#257;ni is a
corrupt form of S&#257;tt&#257;davan, which, literally means one who
does not wear (the sacred thread and tuft of hair). For temple services
R&#257;m&#257;nuja classed Vaishnavites into S&#257;ttinavan and
S&#257;tt&#257;davan. The former are invariably Br&#257;hmans, and the
latter S&#363;dras. Hence S&#257;t&#257;ni is the professional name
given to a group of the Vaishnava creed. It is sometimes stated that
the S&#257;t&#257;nis of the Madras Presidency are the disciples of the
famous Beng&#257;li reformer Chaitanya (15th century), from whom, they
say, the term S&#257;t&#257;ni took its origin. But, so far as I can
ascertain, this supposition rests on no better foundation than the
similarity in sound of the two names, and it seems to me more than
doubtful. There is no evidence of Chaitanya having ever preached in the
Dravidian country, and the tenets of the S&#257;t&#257;nis of this
Presidency differ widely from those of the followers of Chaitanya. The
former worship only Krishna, while the latter venerate Vishnu in the
form of N&#257;r&#257;yana also. The S&#257;t&#257;nis, too, have as
much reverence for R&#257;m&#257;nuja as the followers of Chaitanya
have towards their guru, who is said to be an incarnation of Krishna.
With <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>regard to their religion, it will suffice to say
that they are Tengalai Vaishnavites. They shave their heads completely,
and tie their lower cloth like a Br&#257;hman bachelor. In their
ceremonies they more or less follow the Br&#257;hmans, but the sacred
thread is not worn by them. Though the consumption of alcoholic liquor
and animal food is strictly prohibited, they practice both to a
considerable extent on all festive occasions, and at sr&#257;dhs.
Drinking and other excesses are common. Some S&#257;t&#257;nis bury the
dead, and others burn them. The principal occupations of
S&#257;t&#257;nis are making garlands, carrying the torches during the
god&rsquo;s procession, and sweeping the temple floor. They also make
umbrellas, flower baskets and boxes of palmyra leaves, and prepare the
sacred balls of white clay (for making the Vaishnavite sectarian mark),
and saffron powder. Their usual agnomen is Aiya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1901, the S&#257;t&#257;nis are summed
up as being &ldquo;a Telugu caste of temple servants supposed to have
come into existence in the time of the great Vaishnavite reformer
Sr&#299; R&#257;m&#257;nuj&#257;ch&#257;rya (A.D. 1100). The principal
endogamous sub-divisions of this caste are (1) Ek&#257;kshari, (2)
Chatur&#257;kshari, (3) Asht&#257;kshari, and (4) Kulas&#275;khara. The
Ek&#257;ksharis (&#275;ka, one, and akshara, syllable) hope to get
salvation by reciting the one mystic syllable &#332;m; the
Chatur&#257;ksharis believe in the religious efficacy of the four
syllables R&#257;-m&#257;-nu-j&#257;; the Asht&#257;ksharis hold that
the recitation of the eight syllables
&#332;m-na-m&#333;-n&#257;-r&#257;-ya-n&#257;-ya (&#332;m! salutation
to N&#257;r&#257;yana) will ensure them eternal bliss; and the
Kulas&#275;kharas, who wear the sacred thread, claim to be the
descendants of the Vaishnava saint Kulas&#275;khara &#256;lv&#257;r,
formerly a king of the K&#275;rala country. The first two sections make
umbrellas, flower garlands, etc., and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Balijas and other S&#363;dra castes of the Vaishnava sects, while the
members of the other two have taken to temple service. In their social
and religious customs, all the sub-divisions closely imitate the
Tengalai Vaishnava Br&#257;hmans. The marriage of girls after puberty,
and the remarriage of widows, are strictly prohibited. Most of them
employ Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hits, but latterly they have taken to
getting priests from their own caste. They attach no importance to the
Sanskrit V&#275;das, or to the ritual sanctioned therein, but revere
the sacred hymns of the twelve Vaishnava saints or &#256;lv&#257;rs,
called N&#257;l&#257;yira Prabandham (book of the four thousand songs),
which is in Tamil. From this their pur&#333;hits recite verses during
marriages and other ceremonies.&rdquo; At the census, 1901,
R&#257;m&#257;nuja was returned as a sub-caste of S&#257;t&#257;ni. In
the Manual of the North Arcot district, Mr. H. A. Stuart describes the
S&#257;t&#257;nis as &ldquo;a mixed religious sect, recruited from time
to time from other castes, excepting Paraiyans, leather-workers, and
Muhammadans. All the S&#257;t&#257;nis are Vaishnavites, but
principally revere B&#257;shyak&#257;r (another name for
R&#257;m&#257;nuja), whom they assert to have been an incarnation of
Vishnu. The S&#257;t&#257;nis are almost entirely confined to the large
towns. Their legitimate occupations are performing menial services in
Vishnu temples, begging, tending flower gardens, selling flower
garlands, making fans, grinding sandalwood into powder, and selling
perfumes. They are the priests of some S&#363;dra castes, and in this
character correspond to the Saivite Pand&#257;rams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Census Report, 1871, the S&#257;t&#257;nis are described as
being &ldquo;frequently religious mendicants, priests of inferior
temples, minstrels, sellers of flowers used as offerings, etc., and
have probably recruited their numbers <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>by the admission into
their ranks of individuals who have been excommunicated from higher
castes. As a matter of fact, many prostitutes join this sect, which has
a recognised position among the Hindus. This can easily be done by the
payment of certain fees, and by eating in company with their
co-religionists. And they thus secure for themselves decent burial with
the ceremonial observances necessary to ensure rest to the
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Mysore Census Report, 1891, it is noted that
S&#257;t&#257;nis are also styled Kh&#257;dri Vaishnavas,
S&#257;tt&#257;dav&#257;l, Ch&#257;t&#257;li, Kulas&#275;khara, and
Sam&#275;r&#257;ya. These names, however, seem to have pricked their
<i>amour propre</i> in the late census, and they took considerable
pains not only to cast them off, but also to enrol themselves as
Prapanna Vaishnav&#257;s, Nambi, Venkatapura Vaishnav&#257;s, etc. The
idea of being tabulated as S&#363;dras was so hateful to them that, in
a few places, the enumerators, who had so noted down their caste
according to precedent, were prosecuted by them for defamation. The
cases were of course thrown out. Further, the Mysore Census
Superintendent, 1901, writes that &ldquo;the sub-divisions of the
S&#257;t&#257;nis are Khadri Vaishnav&#257;s, Natacharamurti, Prathama
Vaishnava, Sameraya or Samogi, Sankara, Suri, Satt&#257;dhava, Telugu
S&#257;t&#257;ni, and Venkatapurada. Some are employed in agriculture,
but as a rule they are engaged in the service of Vishnu temples, and
are flower-gatherers, torch-bearers, and strolling
minstrels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The S&#257;t&#257;nis are also called D&#257;sa Nambis. They are
flesh-eaters, but some have now become pure vegetarians. There are, for
example, at Srivilliputt&#363;r in the Tinnevelly district, a large
number who have abandoned a meat dietary. They are connected with the
temple of &#256;nd&#257;l, and supply flowers and tulsi (<i>Ocimum
sanctum</i>) leaves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302"
name="pb302">302</a>]</span>for worship, carry torches before the
goddess during processions, and watch the gate of the temple during the
night. The small income which they derive from the temple is
supplemented by the manufacture and sale of palmyra leaf baskets, and
umbrellas made from <i>Pandanus</i> leaves. As a class, the
S&#257;t&#257;nis are given to liquor, and all important ceremonial
occasions are made the excuse for copious potations. This weakness is
so well known that, in the north of the Presidency, the term
R&#257;m&#257;nuja Matham is used to denote the consumption of meat and
drink at death or sr&#257;dh ceremonies, just as Saivam signifies
vegetarianism. The S&#257;t&#257;ni mendicant can be recognised by the
peculiar flat gourd-shaped brass pot and palm leaf fan which he
carries. The S&#257;t&#257;nis claim to have sprung from the sweat of
Vir&#257;t Purusha (lord of the universe). The following legend is
told, as accounting for the removal of the kudumi (tuft of hair on the
head), and wearing the cloth without a fold behind. In the time of
R&#257;m&#257;nuja, the S&#257;t&#257;nis enjoyed certain privileges in
the temples, but, not satisfied with these, they claimed to take rank
next to Br&#257;hmans. This privilege was accorded, and, when flowers
and other things used in the worship of the god were to be distributed,
they were handed over to the S&#257;t&#257;nis. They, however, were
unable to decide who should be deputed to represent the community, each
person decrying the others as being of low caste. R&#257;m&#257;nuja
accordingly directed that they should shave their heads, and wear their
loin-cloths with a fold in front only.</p>
<p>In addition to other occupations already noted, S&#257;t&#257;nis
sell turmeric, coloured powders, and sacred balls of white clay used by
Vaishnavites. Some act as priests to Balijas and K&#333;matis, at whose
death ceremonies the presence of a S&#257;t&#257;ni is essential.
Immediately after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303"
name="pb303">303</a>]</span>death, the S&#257;t&#257;ni is summoned,
and he puts sect marks on the corpse. At the grave, cooked food is
offered, and eaten by the S&#257;t&#257;ni and members of the family of
the deceased. On the last day of the death ceremonies
(karm&#257;ndiram), the S&#257;t&#257;ni comes to the house of the dead
person late in the evening, bringing with him certain idols, which are
worshipped with offerings of cooked rice, flesh, and liquor in jars.
The food is distributed among those present, and the liquor is doled
out from a spoon called parikam, or a broom dipped in the liquor, which
is drunk as it drips therefrom.</p>
<p>S&#257;t&#257;ni women dress just like Vaishnava Br&#257;hman women,
from whom it is difficult to distinguish them. In former days, the
S&#257;t&#257;nis used to observe a festival called ravikala (bodice)
utchavam, which now goes by the name of gandapodi (sandal powder)
utchavam. The festival, as originally carried out, was a very obscene
rite. After the worship of the god by throwing sandal powder, etc., the
S&#257;t&#257;nis returned home, and indulged in copious libations of
liquor. The women threw their bodices into vessel, and they were picked
out at random by the men. The woman whose bodice was thus secured
became the partner of the man for the day.</p>
<p>For the following note on S&#257;t&#257;nis in the Vizagapatam
district, I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. S&#257;t&#257;ni is
said to be the shortened form of Sathth&#257;davan, the uncovered man.
They are prohibited from covering three different parts of their
bodies, viz., the head with the usual tuft of hair, the body with the
sacred thread, and the waist with the customary strip of cloth. All
devout S&#257;t&#257;nis shave their heads completely. [There is a
proverb &ldquo;Tie a knot on the S&#257;t&#257;ni&rsquo;s tuft of hair,
and on the ascetic&rsquo;s holy thread.&rdquo; The S&#257;t&#257;nis
shave the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>whole head, and the Sany&#257;sis have no sacred
thread.]<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4594src" href="#xd21e4594" name=
"xd21e4594src">20</a> The caste is divided into exogamous septs, or
intip&#275;rulu. The custom of m&#275;narikam, according to which a man
marries his maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter, is observed. The
remarriage of widows and divorce are not allowed. Attempts have been
made by some members of the caste, in other parts of the Madras
Presidency, to connect themselves with Chaitanya. But, so far as the
Vizagapatam district is concerned, this is repudiated. They are
R&#257;m&#257;nuja Vaishnavas of the Tenkalai persuasion. Their gurus
are known as Paravasthuv&#257;ru&mdash;a corruption of Parav&#257;su
D&#275;va, whose figure is on the vim&#257;na of the Sr&#299;rangam
temple, and who must be visited before entering the principal
sanctuary. They live at G&#363;ms&#363;r in Ganjam, and have
Sadach&#257;rulu, or ever-devout followers, who act as their agents in
Vizagapatam. They brand the shoulders of S&#257;t&#257;nis with the
Vaishnavite emblems, the sankha and chakra, and initiate them into the
mysteries of the Vaishnava religion by whispering into their ears the
word R&#257;m&#257;nuja. The S&#257;t&#257;ni learns by heart various
songs in eulogy of Sr&#299;rangam and its deity, by means of which he
earns his living. He rises in the early morning, and, after a bath,
adorns his forehead and body with the Vaishnavite n&#257;mam, ties
round his clean-shaved head a string of tulsi (<i>Ocimum sanctum</i>)
beads known as thirupavithram, puts a tulsi garland round his neck, and
takes a fan called gajakarnam, or elephant&rsquo;s ear, in his right
hand. In his left hand he carries a copper gourd-shaped vessel. He is
generally accompanied by another S&#257;t&#257;ni similarly got up.
When begging, they sing the songs referred to above, and collect the
rice which is given to them in their vessels. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>At
the end of their round they return home, and their wives clean the
rice, bow down before it, and cook it. No portion of the rice obtained
by begging should be sold for money. The S&#257;t&#257;nis play an
important part in the social life of the Vaishnavites of the district,
and are the gurus of some of the cultivating and other classes. They
preside at the final death ceremonies of the non-Br&#257;hman
Vaishnavite castes. They burn their dead, and perform the chinna
(little) and pedda r&#333;zu (big day) death ceremonies.</p>

important hill-tribe in Ganjam and Vizagapatam.The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>name
is derived by General Cunningham from the Scythian sagar, an axe, in
reference to the axe which they carry in their hands. In Sanskrit,
sabara or savara means a mountaineer, barbarian, or savage. The tribe
has been identified by various authorities with the Suari of Pliny and
Sabarai of Ptolemy. &ldquo;Towards the Ganges,&rdquo; the latter
writes, &ldquo;are the Sabarai, in whose country the diamond is found
in great abundance.&rdquo; This diamond-producing country is located by
Cunningham near Sambalp&#363;r in the Central Provinces. In one of his
grants, Nandivarma Pallavamalla, a Pallava king, claims to have
released the hostile king of the S&#257;baras, Udayana by name, and
captured his mirror-banner made of peacock&rsquo;s feathers. The Rev.
T. Foulkes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4628src" href="#xd21e4628" name=
"xd21e4628src">21</a> identifies the S&#257;baras of this copper-plate
grant with the Savaras of the eastern gh&#257;ts. But Dr. E. Hultzsch,
who has re-edited the grant,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4631src" href=
"#xd21e4631" name="xd21e4631src">22</a> is of opinion that these
S&#257;baras cannot be identified with the Savaras. The Aitareya
Br&#257;hmana of the Rig-v&#275;da makes the Savaras the descendants of
the sons of Visv&#257;mitra, who were cursed to become impure by their
father for an act of disobedience, while the R&#257;mayana describes
them as having emanated from the body of Vasishta&rsquo;s cow to fight
against the sage Visv&#257;mitra.</p>
<p>The language of the Savaras is included by Mr. G. A.
Grierson<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4640src" href="#xd21e4640" name=
"xd21e4640src">23</a> in the Mund&#257; family. It has, he writes,
&ldquo;been largely influenced by Telugu, and is no longer an unmixed
form of speech. It is most closely related to Khari&#257; and
Ju&#257;ng, but in some characteristics differs from them, and agrees
with the various dialects of the language which has in this
(linguistic) survey been described under the denomination of
Kherw&#257;ri.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href=
"#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Savaras are described by Mr. F. Fawcett<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4646src" href="#xd21e4646" name="xd21e4646src">24</a> as being
much more industrious than the Khonds. &ldquo;Many a time,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;have I tried to find a place for an extra paddy (rice)
field might be made, but never with success. It is not too much to say
that paddy is grown on every available foot of arable ground, all the
hill streams being utilized for this purpose. From almost the very tops
of the hills, in fact from wherever the springs are, there are paddy
fields; at the top of every small area a few square yards, the front
perpendicular revetment [of large masses of stones] sometimes as large
in area as the area of the field; and larger and larger, down the
hillside, taking every advantage of every available foot of ground
there are fields below fields to the bottoms of the valleys. The Saoras
show remarkable engineering skill in constructing their paddy fields,
and I wish I could do it justice. They seem to construct them in the
most impossible places, and certainly at the expense of great labour.
Yet, with all their superior activity and industry, the Saoras are
decidedly physically inferior to the Khonds. It seems hard the Saoras
should not be allowed to reap the benefit of their industry, but must
give half of it to the parasitic Bissoyis and their retainers. The
greater part of the Saoras&rsquo; hills have been denuded of forest
owing to the persistent hacking down of trees for the purpose of
growing dry crops, so much so that, in places, the hills look almost
bare in the dry weather. Nearly all the jungle (mostly s&#257;l,
<i>Shorea robusta</i>) is cut down every few years. When the Saoras
want to work a piece of new ground, where the jungle has been allowed
to grow for a few years, the trees are cut down, and, when dry, burned,
and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>ground is grubbed up by the women with a kind of
hoe. The hoe is used on the steep hill sides, where the ground is very
stony and rocky, and the stumps of the felled trees are numerous, and
the plough cannot be used. In the paddy fields, or on any flat ground,
they use ploughs of lighter and simpler make than those used in the
plains. They use cattle for ploughing.&rdquo; It is noted by Mr. G. V.
Ramamurti Pantulu, in an article on the Savaras, that &ldquo;in some
cases the Bissoyi, who was originally a feudatory chief under the
authority of the zemindar, and in other cases the zemindar claims a
fixed rent in kind or cash, or both. Subject to the rents payable to
the Bissoyis, the Savaras under them are said to exercise their right
to sell or mortgage their lands. Below the gh&#257;ts, in the plains,
the Savara has lost his right, and the mustajars or the renters to whom
the Savara villages are farmed out take half of whatever crops are
raised by the Savaras.&rdquo; Mr. Ramamurti states further that a
new-comer should obtain the permission of the G&#333;mongo (headman)
and the B&#333;ya before he can reclaim any jungle land, and that, at
the time of sale or mortgage, the village elders should be present, and
partake of the flesh of the pig sacrificed on the occasion. In some
places, the Savaras are said to be entirely in the power of Paidi
settlers from the plains, who seize their entire produce on the plea of
debts contracted at a usurious rate of interests. In recent years, some
Savaras emigrated to Assam to work in the tea-gardens. But emigration
has now stopped by edict.</p>
<p>The sub-divisions among the Savaras, which, so far as I can gather,
are recognised, are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>A.&mdash;Hill Savaras.</i></p>
<p>(1) Savara, J&#257;ti Savara (Savaras <i>par excellence</i>), or
M&#257;liah Savara. They regard themselves as superior <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>to
the other divisions. They will eat the flesh of the buffalo, but not of
the cow.</p>
<p>(2) Arsi, Arisi, or Lombo Lanjiya. Arsi means monkey, and Lombo
Lanjiya, indicating long-tailed, is the name by which members of this
section are called, in reference to the long piece of cloth, which the
males allow to hang down. The occupation is said to be weaving the
coarse cloths worn by members of the tribe, as well as agriculture.</p>
<p>(3) Lu&#257;ra or M&#363;li. Workers in iron, who make arrow heads,
and other articles.</p>
<p>(4) Kindal. Basket-makers, who manufacture rough baskets for holding
grain.</p>
<p>(5) J&#257;du. Said to be a name among the Savaras for the hill
country beyond Kollakota and Putt&#257;singi.</p>
<p>(6) Kumbi. Potters who make earthen pots. &ldquo;These pots,&rdquo;
Mr. Fawcett writes, &ldquo;are made in a few villages in the Saora
hills. Earthen vessels are used for cooking, or for hanging up in
houses as fetishes of ancestral spirits or certain deities.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>B.&mdash;Savaras of the low country</i>.</p>
<p>(7) K&#257;pu (denoting cultivator), or Pallapu.</p>
<p>(8) Suddho (good).</p>
<p>It has been noted that the pure Savara tribes have restricted
themselves to the tracts of hill and jungle-covered valleys. But, as
the plains are approached, traces of amalgamation become apparent,
resulting in a hybrid race, whose appearance and manners differ but
little from those of the ordinary denizens of the low country. The
K&#257;pu Savaras are said to retain many of the Savara customs,
whereas the Suddho Savaras have adopted the language and customs of the
Oriya castes. The K&#257;pu section is sometimes called Kudunga or
Baseng, and the latter name is said by Mr. Ramamurti <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>to
be derived from the Savara word basi, salt. It is, he states, applied
to the plains below the gh&#257;ts, as, in the fairs held there, salt
is purchased by the Savaras of the hills, and the name is used to
designate the Savaras living there. A class name Kampu is referred to
by Mr. Ramamurti, who says that the name &ldquo;implies that the
Savaras of this class have adopted the customs of the Hindu Kampus
(Oriya for K&#257;pu). Kudumba is another name by which they are known,
but it is reported that there is a sub-division of them called by this
name.&rdquo; He further refers to Bobbili and Bh&#299;ma as the names
of distinct sub-divisions. Bobbili is a town in the Vizagapatam
district, and Bh&#299;ma was the second of the five P&#257;ndava
brothers.</p>
<p>In an account of the M&#257;liya Savarulu, published in the
&lsquo;Catalogue Raisonn&eacute; of Oriental
Manuscripts,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4692src" href=
"#xd21e4692" name="xd21e4692src">25</a> it is recorded that &ldquo;they
build houses over mountain torrents, previously throwing trees across
the chasms; and these houses are in the midst of forests of fifty or
more miles in extent. The reason of choosing such situations is stated
to be in order that they may more readily escape by passing underneath
their houses, and through the defile, in the event of any disagreement
and hostile attack in reference to other rulers or neighbours. They
cultivate independently, and pay tax or tribute to no one. If the
zemindar of the neighbourhood troubles them for tribute, they go in a
body to his house by night, set it on fire, plunder, and kill; and then
retreat, with their entire households, into the wilds and fastnesses.
They do in like manner with any of the zemindar&rsquo;s subordinates,
if troublesome to them. If they are courted, and a compact is made with
them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>they will then abstain from any wrong or
disturbance. If the zemindar, unable to bear with them, raise troops
and proceed to destroy their houses, they escape underneath by a
private way, as above mentioned. The invaders usually burn the houses,
and retire. If the zemindar forego his demands, and make an agreement
with them, they rebuild their houses in the same situations, and then
render assistance to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The modern Savara settlement is described by Mr. Fawcett as having
two rows of huts parallel and facing each other. &ldquo;Huts,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;are generally built of upright pieces of wood stuck in
the ground, 6 or 8 inches apart, and the intervals filled in with
stones and mud laid alternately, and the whole plastered over with red
mud. Huts are invariably built a few feet above the level of the
ground, often, when the ground is very uneven, 5 feet above the ground
in front. Roofs are always thatched with grass. There is usually but
one door, near one end wall; no windows or ventilators, every chink
being filled up. In front of the doorway there is room for six or eight
people to stand, and there is a loft, made by cross-beams, about 5 feet
from the floor, on which grain is stored in baskets, and under which
the inmates crawl to do their cooking. Bits of sun-dried buffalo meat
and bones, not smelling over-sweet, are suspended from the rafters, or
here and there stuck in between the rafters and the thatch; knives, a
tangi (battle-axe), a sword, and bows and arrows may also be seen stuck
in somewhere under the thatch. Agricultural implements may be seen,
too, small ones stuck under the roof or on the loft, and larger ones
against the wall. As in Ireland, the pig is of sufficient importance to
have a room in the house. There is generally merely a low wall between
the pig&rsquo;s room and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href=
"#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>the rest of the house, and a
separate door, so that it may go in and out without going through that
part of the house occupied by the family. Rude drawings are very common
in Saora houses. They are invariably, if not always, in some way that I
could never clearly apprehend, connected with one of the fetishes in
the house.&rdquo; &ldquo;When,&rdquo; Mr. Ramamurti writes, &ldquo;a
tiger enters a cottage and carries away an inmate, the villages are
deserted, and sacrifices are offered to some spirits by all the
inhabitants. The prevalence of small-pox in a village requires its
abandonment. A succession of calamities leads to the same result. If a
Savara has a number of wives, each of them sometimes requires a
separate house, and the house sites are frequently shifted according to
the caprice of the women. The death or disease of cattle is
occasionally followed by the desertion of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When selecting a site for a new dwelling hut, the M&#257;liah
Savaras place on the proposed site as many grains of rice in pairs as
there are married members in the family, and cover them over with a
cocoanut shell. They are examined on the following day, and, if they
are all there, the site is considered auspicious. Among the K&#257;pu
Savaras, the grains of rice are folded up in leaflets of the bael tree
(<i>&AElig;gle Marmelos</i>), and placed in split bamboo.</p>
<p>It is recorded by Mr. Fawcett, in connection with the use of the
duodecimal system by the Savaras that, &ldquo;on asking a G&#333;mango
how he reckoned when selling produce to the P&#257;nos, he began to
count on his fingers. In order to count 20, he began on the left foot
(he was squatting), and counted 5; then with the left hand 5 more; then
with the two first fingers of the right hand he made 2 more,
<i>i.e.</i>, 12 altogether; then with the thumb of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>right hand and the other two fingers of the
same, and the toes of the right foot he made 8 more. And so it was
always. They have names for numerals up to 12 only, and to count 20
always count first twelve and then eight in the manner described,
except that they may begin on either hand or foot. To count 50 or 60,
they count by twenties, and put down a stone or some mark for each
twenty. There is a Saora story accounting for their numerals being
limited to 12. One day, long ago, some Saoras were measuring grain in a
field, and, when they had measured 12 measures of some kind, a tiger
pounced in on them and devoured them. So, ever after, they dare not
have a numeral above 12, for fear of a tiger repeating the
performance.&rdquo;</p>

"images/pl6-313.jpg" alt="Savara." width="528" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Savara.</p>
</div>
<p>The Savaras are described by Mr. Fawcett as &ldquo;below the middle
height; face rather flat; lips thick; nose broad and flat; cheek bones
high; eyes slightly oblique. They are as fair as the Uriyas, and fairer
than the Telugus of the plains. Not only is the Saora shorter and
fairer than other hill people, but his face is distinctly Mongolian,
the obliquity of the eyes being sometimes very marked, and the inner
corners of the eyes are generally very oblique. [The Mongolian type is
clearly brought out in the illustration.] The Saora&rsquo;s endurance
in going up and down hill, whether carrying heavy loads or not, is
wonderful. Four Saoras have been known to carry a 10-stone man in a
chair straight up a 3,800 feet hill without relief, and without rest.
Usually, the Saora&rsquo;s dress (his full dress) consists of a large
bunch of feathers (generally white) stuck in his hair on the crown of
his head, a coloured cloth round his head as a turban, and worn much on
the back of the head, and folded tightly, so as to be a good protection
to the head. When feathers are not worn, the hair is tied on the top
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>of the head, or a little at the side of it. A
piece of flat brass is another head ornament. It is stuck in the hair,
which is tied in a knot at the crown of the head, at an angle of about
40&deg; from the perpendicular, and its waving up and down motion as a
man walks has a curious effect. Another head ornament is a piece of
wood, about 8 or 9 inches in length and &frac34; inch in diameter, with
a flat button about 2 inches in diameter on the top, all covered with
hair or coloured thread, and worn in the same position as the flat
piece of brass. A peacock&rsquo;s feather, or one or two of the tail
feathers of the jungle cock, may be often seen stuck in the knot of
hair on the top of the head. A cheroot or two, perhaps half smoked, may
often be seen sticking in the hair of a man or woman, to be used again
when wanted. They also smoke pipes, and the old women seem particularly
fond of them. Round the Saora&rsquo;s neck are brass and bead
necklaces. A man will wear as many as thirty necklaces at a time, or
rather necklaces of various lengths passed as many as thirty times
round his neck. Round the Saora&rsquo;s waist, and under his fork, is
tied a cloth with coloured ends hanging in front and behind. When a
cloth on the body is worn, it is usually worn crossed in front. The
women wear necklaces like the men. Their hair is tied at the back of
the head, and is sometimes confined with a fillet. They wear only one
cloth, tied round the waist. During feasts, or when dancing, they
generally wear a cloth over the shoulders. Every male wears a small
ring, generally of silver, in the right nostril, and every female wears
a similar ring in each nostril, and in the septum. As I have been told,
these rings are put in the nose on the eighth or tenth day after birth.
Bangles are often worn by men and women. Anklets, too, are sometimes
worn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>by the women. Brass necklets and many other
ornaments are made in Saora hills by the Gangsis, a low tribe of
workers in brass. The Saora&rsquo;s weapons are the bow, sometimes
ornamented with peacock&rsquo;s feathers, sword, dagger, and tangi. The
bow used by the Saoras is much smaller than the bow used by any of the
other hill people. It is generally about 3&frac12; feet long, and the
arrows from 18 to 21 inches. The bow is always made of bamboo, and so
is the string. The arrows are reeds tipped with iron, and leathered on
two sides only. A blunt-headed arrow is used for shooting birds. Every
Saora can use the bow from boyhood, and can shoot straight up to 25 or
30 yards.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>As regards the marriage customs of the Savaras, Mr. Fawcett writes
that &ldquo;a Saora may marry a woman of his own or of any other
village. A man may have as many as three wives, or, if he is a man of
importance, such as G&#333;mango of a large village, he may have four.
Not that there is any law in the matter, but it is considered that
three, or at most four, are as many as a man can manage. For his first
marriage, a man chooses a young woman he fancies; his other wives are
perhaps her sisters, or other women who have come to him. A woman may
leave her husband whenever she pleases. Her husband cannot prevent her.
When a woman leaves her husband to join herself to another, the other
pays the husband she has left a buffalo and a pig. Formerly, it is
said, if he did not pay up, the man she left would kill the man to whom
she went. Now arbitration comes into play. I believe a man usually
takes a second wife after his first has had a child; if he did so
before, the first wife would say he was impotent. As the getting of the
first wife is more troublesome and expensive than getting the others,
she is treated the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316"
name="pb316">316</a>]</span>best. In some places, all a man&rsquo;s
wives are said to live together peaceably. It is not the custom in the
Kolakotta villages. Knowing the wives would fight if together, domestic
felicity is maintained by keeping up different establishments. A
man&rsquo;s wives will visit one another in the daytime, but one wife
will never spend the night in the house of another. An exception to
this is that the first wife may invite one of the other wives to sleep
in her house with the husband. As each wife has her separate house, so
has she her separate piece of ground on the hill-side to cultivate. The
wives will not co-operate in working each other&rsquo;s cultivation,
but they will work together, with the husband, in the paddy fields.
Each wife keeps the produce of the ground she cultivates in her own
house. Produce of the paddy fields is divided into equal shares among
the wives. If a wife will not work properly, or if she gives away
anything belonging to her husband, she may be divorced. Any man may
marry a divorced woman, but she must pay to her former husband a
buffalo and a pig. If a man catches his wife in adultery (he must see
her in the act), he thinks he has a right to kill her, and her lover
too. But this is now generally (but not always) settled by arbitration,
and the lover pays up. A wife caught in adultery will never be retained
as a wife. As any man may have as many as three wives, illicit
attachments are common. During large feasts, when the Saoras give
themselves up to sensuality, there is no doubt a great deal of
promiscuous intercourse. A widow is considered bound to marry her
husband&rsquo;s brother, or his brother&rsquo;s sons if he has no
younger brothers. A number of Saoras once came to me to settle a
dispute. They were in their full dress, with feathers and weapons. The
dispute was this. A young woman&rsquo;s husband was dead, and his
younger <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=
"pb317">317</a>]</span>brother was almost of an age to take her to
wife. She had fixed her affections on a man of another village, and
made up her mind to have him and no one else. Her village people wanted
compensation in the shape of a buffalo, and also wanted her ornaments.
The men of the other village said no, they could not give a buffalo.
Well, they should give a pig at least&mdash;no, they had no pig. Then
they must give some equivalent. They would give one rupee. That was not
enough&mdash;at least three rupees. They were trying to carry the young
woman off by force to make her marry her brother-in-law, but were
induced to accept the rupee, and have the matter settled by their
respective Bissoyis. The young woman was most obstinate, and insisted
on having her own choice, and keeping her ornaments. Her village people
had no objection to her choice, provided the usual compensation was
paid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one far out-of-the-way village the marriage ceremony
consists in this. The bride&rsquo;s father is plied with liquor two or
three times; a feast is made in the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, to which
the bride comes with her father; and after the feast she remains in the
man&rsquo;s house as his wife. They know nothing of capture. In the
Kolakotta valley, below this village, a different custom prevails. The
following is an account of a Saora marriage as given by the
G&#333;mango of one of the Kolakotta villages, and it may be taken as
representative of the purest Saora marriage ceremony. &lsquo;I wished
to marry a certain girl, and, with my brother and his son, went to her
house. I carried a pot of liquor, and arrow, and one brass bangle for
the girl&rsquo;s mother. Arrived at the house, I put the liquor and the
arrow on the floor. I and the two with me drank the liquor&mdash;no one
else had any. The father of the girl said <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb318" href="#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span>&lsquo;Why have you
brought the liquor?&rsquo; I said &lsquo;Because I want your
daughter.&rsquo; He said &lsquo;Bring a big pot of liquor, and we will
talk about it.&rsquo; I took the arrow I brought with me, and stuck it
in the thatch of the roof just above the wall, took up the empty pot,
and went home with those who came with me. Four days afterwards, with
the same two and three others of my village, I went to the girl&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s house with a big pot of liquor. About fifteen or twenty
people of the village were present. The father said he would not give
the girl, and, saying so, he smashed the pot of liquor, and, with those
of his village, beat us so that we ran back to our village. I was glad
of the beating, as I know by it I was pretty sure of success. About ten
days afterwards, ten or twenty of my village people went with me again,
carrying five pots of liquor, which we put in the girl&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s house. I carried an arrow, which I stuck in the thatch
beside the first one. The father and the girl&rsquo;s nearest male
relative each took one of the arrows I had put in the thatch, and,
holding them in their left hands, drank some of the liquor. I now felt
sure of success. I then put two more arrows in the father&rsquo;s left
hand, holding them in his hand with both of my hands over his, and
asked him to drink. Two fresh arrows were likewise placed in the left
hands of all the girl&rsquo;s male relatives, while I asked them to
drink. To each female relative of the girl I gave a brass bangle, which
I put on their right wrists while I asked them to drink. The five pots
of liquor were drunk by the girl&rsquo;s male and female relations, and
the villagers. When the liquor was all drunk, the girl&rsquo;s father
said &lsquo;Come again in a month, and bring more liquor.&rsquo; In a
month I went again, with all the people of my village, men, women and
children, dancing as we went (to music of course), taking <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>with
us thirty pots of liquor, and a little rice and a cloth for the
girl&rsquo;s mother; also some hill dholl (pulse), which we put in the
father&rsquo;s house. The liquor was set down in the middle of the
village, and the villagers, and those who came with me, drank the
liquor and danced. The girl did not join in this; she was in the house.
When the liquor was finished, my village people went home, but I
remained in the father&rsquo;s house. For three days I stayed, and
helped him to work in his fields. I did not sleep with the girl; the
father and I slept in one part of the house, and the girl and her
mother in another. At the end of the three days I went home. About ten
days afterwards, I, with about ten men of my village, went to watch for
the girl going to the stream for water. When we saw her, we caught her,
and ran away with her. She cried out and the people of her village came
after us, and fought with us. We got her off to my village, and she
remained with me as my wife. After she became my wife, her mother gave
her a cloth and a bangle.<span class="corr" id="xd21e4742" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> The same individual said that, if a man
wants a girl, and cannot afford to give the liquor, etc., to her
people, he takes her off by force. If she likes him, she remains, but,
if not, she runs home. He will carry her off three times, but not
oftener; and, if after the third time she again runs away, he leaves
her. The Saoras themselves say that formerly every one took his wife by
force.<a id="xd21e4745" name="xd21e4745"></a> In a case which occurred
a few years ago, a bridegroom did not comply with the usual custom of
giving a feast to the bride&rsquo;s people, and the bride&rsquo;s
mother objected to the marriage on that account. The bridegroom&rsquo;s
party, however, managed to carry off the bride. Her mother raised an
alarm, whereon a number of people ran up, and tried to stop the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party. They were outnumbered, and one was knocked
down, and died from rupture of the spleen. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span></p>
<p>A further account of the Saora marriage customs is given by Mr.
Ramamurti Pantulu, who writes as follows. &ldquo;When the parents of a
young man consider it time to seek a bride for him, they make enquiries
and even consult their relatives and friends as to a suitable girl for
him. The girl&rsquo;s parents are informally apprised of their
selection. On a certain day, the male relatives of the youth go to the
girl&rsquo;s house to make a proposal of marriage. Her parents, having
received previous notice of the visit, have the door of the house open
or closed, according as they approve or disapprove of the match. On
arrival at the house, the visitors knock at the door, and, if it is
open, enter without further ceremony. Sometimes the door is broken
open. If the girl&rsquo;s parents object to the match, they remain
silent, and will not touch the liquor brought by the visitors, and they
go away. Should, however, they regard it with favour, they charge the
visitors with intruding, shower abuse on them, and beat them, it may
be, so severely that wounds are inflicted, and blood is shed. This
ill-treatment is borne cheerfully, and without resistance, as it is a
sign that the girl&rsquo;s hand will be bestowed on the young man. The
liquor is then placed on the floor, and, after more abuse, all present
partake thereof. If the girl&rsquo;s parents refuse to give her in
marriage after the performance of this ceremony, they have to pay a
penalty to the parents of the disappointed suitor. Two or three days
later, the young man&rsquo;s relatives go a second time to the
girl&rsquo;s house, taking with them three pots of liquor, and a bundle
composed of as many arrows as there are male members in the
girl&rsquo;s family. The liquor is drunk, and the arrows are presented,
one to each male. After an interval of some days, a third visit is
paid, and three pots of liquor smeared with turmeric paste, and a
quantity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>of turmeric, are taken to the house. The liquor
is drunk, and the turmeric paste is smeared over the back and haunches
of the girl&rsquo;s relatives. Some time afterwards, the marriage
ceremony takes place. The bridegroom&rsquo;s party proceed to the house
of the bride, dancing and singing to the accompaniment of all the
musical instruments except the drum, which is only played at funerals.
With them they take twenty big pots of liquor, a pair of brass bangles
and a cloth for the bride&rsquo;s mother, and head cloths for the
father, brothers, and other male relatives. When everything is ready,
the priest is called in. One of the twenty pots is decorated, and an
arrow is fixed in the ground at its side. The priest then repeats
prayers to the invisible spirits and ancestors, and pours some of the
liquor into leaf-cups prepared in the names of the ancestors [Jojonji
and Yoyonji, male and female], and the chiefs of the village. This
liquor is considered very sacred, and is sprinkled from a leaf over the
shoulders and feet of the elders present. The father of the bride,
addressing the priest, says &lsquo;B&#333;ya, I have drunk the liquor
brought by the bridegroom&rsquo;s father, and thereby have accepted his
proposal for a marriage between his son and my daughter. I do not know
whether the girl will afterwards agree to go to her husband, or not.
Therefore it is well that you should ask her openly to speak out her
mind.&rsquo; The priest accordingly asks the girl if she has any
objection, and she replies &lsquo;My father and mother, and all my
relatives have drunk the bridegroom&rsquo;s liquor. I am a Savara, and
he is a Savara. Why then should I not marry him?&rsquo; Then all the
people assembled proclaim that the pair are husband and wife. This
done, the big pot of liquor, which has been set apart from the rest, is
taken into the bride&rsquo;s house. This pot, with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>another pot of liquor purchased at the expense
of the bride&rsquo;s father, is given to the bridegroom&rsquo;s party
when it retires. Every house-holder receives the bridegroom and his
party at his house, and offers them liquor, rice, and flesh, which they
cannot refuse to partake of without giving offence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4755width" id="pl6-321"><img src=
"images/pl6-321.jpg" alt="Savara." width="528" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Savara.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever,&rdquo; Mr. Ramamurti continues, &ldquo;marries a
widow, whether it is her husband&rsquo;s younger brother or some one of
her own choice, must perform a religious ceremony, during which a pig
is sacrificed. The flesh, with some liquor, is offered to the ghost of
the widow&rsquo;s deceased husband, and prayers are addressed by the
B&#333;yas to propitiate the ghost, so that it may not torment the
woman and her second husband. &lsquo;Oh! man,&rsquo; says the priest,
addressing the deceased by name, &lsquo;Here is an animal sacrificed to
you, and with this all connection between this woman and you ceases.
She has taken with her no property belonging to you or your children.
So do not torment her within the house or outside the house, in the
jungle or on the hill, when she is asleep or when she wakes. Do not
send sickness on her children. Her second husband has done no harm to
you. She chose him for her husband, and he consented. Oh! man, be
appeased; Oh! unseen ones; Oh! ancestors, be you witnesses.&rsquo; The
animal sacrificed on this occasion is called long danda (inside fine),
or fine paid to the spirit of a dead person inside the earth. The
animal offered up, when a man marries a divorced woman, is called bayar
danda (outside fine), or fine paid as compensation to a man living
outside the earth. The moment that a divorc&eacute;e marries another
man, her former husband pounces upon him, shoots his buffalo or pig
dead with an arrow, and takes it to his village, where its flesh is
served up at a feast. The B&#333;ya invokes the unseen <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>spirits, that they may not be angry with the man
who has married the woman, as he has paid the penalty prescribed by the
elders according to the immemorial custom of the Savaras.</p>
<p>From a still further account of the ceremonial observances in
connection with marriage, with variations, I gather that the liquor is
the fermented juice of the salop or sago palm (<i>Caryota urens</i>),
and is called ara-s&#257;l. On arrival at the girl&rsquo;s house, on
the first occasion, the young man&rsquo;s party sit at the door
thereof, and, making three cups from the leaves kiredol (<i>Uncaria
Gambier</i>) or j&#257;k (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>), pour the
liquor into them, and lay them on the ground. As the liquor is being
poured into the cups, certain names, which seem to be those of the
ancestors, are called out. The liquor is then drunk, and an arrow
(&#257;m) is stuck in the roof, and a brass bangle (khadu) left, before
the visitors take their departure. If the match is unacceptable to the
girl&rsquo;s family, the arrow and bangle are returned. The second
visit is called pank-s&#257;l, or sang-sang-dal-sol, because the liquor
pots are smeared with turmeric paste. Sometimes it is called
nyanga-dal-sol, because the future bridegroom carries a small pot of
liquor on a stick borne on the shoulder; or pojang, because the arrow,
which has been stuck in the roof, is set up in the ground close to one
of the pots of liquor. In some places, several visits take place
subsequent to the first visit, at one of which, called rodai-s&#257;l,
a quarrel arises.</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. Ramamurti Pantulu that, among the Savaras who
have settled in the low country, some differences have arisen in the
marriage rites &ldquo;owing to the introduction of Hindu custom,
<i>i.e.</i>, those obtaining among the S&#363;dra castes. Some of the
Savaras who are more Hinduised than others consult their medicine men
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>as to what day would be most auspicious for a
marriage, erect pandals (booths), dispense with the use of liquor,
substituting for it thick jaggery (crude sugar) water, and hold a
festival for two or three days. But even the most Hinduised Savara has
not yet fallen directly into the hands of the Br&#257;hman
priest.&rdquo; At the marriage ceremony of some K&#257;pu Savaras, the
bride and bridegroom sit side by side at the auspicious moment, and
partake of boiled rice (korra) from green leaf-cups, the pair
exchanging cups. Before the bridegroom and his party proceed to their
village with the bride, they present the males and females of her
village with a rupee, which is called janjul naglipu, or money paid for
taking away the girl. In another form of K&#257;pu Savara marriage, the
would-be bridegroom and his party proceed, on an auspicious day, to the
house of the selected girl, and offer betel and tobacco, the acceptance
of which is a sign that the match is agreeable to her parents. On a
subsequent day, a small sum of money is paid as the bride-price. On the
wedding day the bride is conducted to the home of the bridegroom, where
the contracting couple are lifted up by two people, who dance about
with them. If the bride attempts to enter the house, she is caught hold
of, and made to pay a small sum of money before she is permitted to do
so. Inside the house, the officiating D&#275;s&#257;ri ties the ends of
the cloths of the bride and bridegroom together, after the ancestors
and invisible spirits have been worshipped.</p>
<p>Of the marriage customs of the K&#257;pu Savaras, the following
account is given in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district.
&ldquo;The K&#257;pu Savaras are taking to m&#275;narikam (marriage
with the maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter), although the hill custom
requires a man to marry outside his village. Their wedding ceremonies
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>bear a distant resemblance to those among the
hill Savaras. Among the K&#257;pu Savaras, the preliminary arrow and
liquor are similarly presented, but the bridegroom goes at length on an
auspicious day with a large party to the bride&rsquo;s house, and the
marriage is marked by his eating out of the same platter with her, and
by much drinking, feasting, and dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Children are named after the day of the week on which they were
born, and nicknames are frequently substituted for the birth name. Mr.
Fawcett records, for example, that a man was called Gylo because, when
a child, he was fond of breaking nuts called gylo, and smearing himself
with their black juice. Another was called Dallo because, in his
youthful days, he was fond of playing about with a basket (dalli) on
his head.</p>
<p>Concerning the death rites, Mr. Fawcett writes as follows. &ldquo;As
soon as a man, woman, or child dies in a house, a gun, loaded with
powder only, is fired off at the door, or, if plenty of powder is
available, several shots are fired, to frighten away the Kulba
(spirit). The gun used is the ordinary Telugu or Uriya matchlock. Water
is poured over the body while in the house. It is then carried away to
the family burning-ground, which is situated from 30 to 80 yards from
the cluster of houses occupied by the family, and there it is burned.
[It is stated by Mr. S. P. Rice<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4789src"
href="#xd21e4789" name="xd21e4789src">26</a> that &ldquo;the dead
man&rsquo;s hands and feet are tied together, and a bamboo is passed
through them. Two men then carry the corpse, slung in this fashion, to
the burning-ground. When it is reached, two posts are stuck up, and the
bamboo, with the corpse tied to it, is placed crosswise on the posts.
Then below the corpse a fire is lighted. The Savara man is always burnt
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>the portion of the ground&mdash;one cannot call
it a field&mdash;which he last cultivated.&rdquo;] The only wood used
for the pyre is that of the mango, and of <i>Pongamia glabra</i>.
Fresh, green branches are cut and used. No dry wood is used, except a
few twigs to light the fire. Were any one to ask those carrying a body
to the burning-ground the name of the deceased or anything about him,
they would be very angry. Guns are fired while the body is being
carried. Everything a man has, his bows and arrows, his tangi, his
dagger, his necklaces, his reaping-hook for cutting paddy, his axe,
some paddy and rice, etc., are burnt with his body. I have been told in
Kolakotta that all a man&rsquo;s money too is burned, but it is
doubtful if it really ever is&mdash;a little may be. A Kolakotta
G&#333;mango told me &ldquo;If we do not burn these things with the
body, the Kulba will come and ask us for them, and trouble us.&rdquo;
The body is burned the day a man dies. The next day, the people of the
family go to the burning-place with water, which they pour over the
embers. The fragments of the bones are then picked out, and buried
about two feet in the ground, and covered over with a miniature hut, or
merely with some thatching grass kept on the place by a few logs of
wood, or in the floor of a small hut (thatched roof without walls) kept
specially for the Kulba at the burning-place. An empty egg-shell
(domestic hen&rsquo;s) is broken under foot, and buried with the bones.
It is not uncommon to send pieces of bone, after burning, to relations
at a distance, to allow them also to perform the funeral rites. The
first sacrificial feast, called the Limma, is usually made about three
or four days after the body has been burnt. In some places, it is said
to be made after a longer interval. For the Limma a fowl is killed at
the burning-place, some rice or other grain is cooked, and, with the
fowl, eaten by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327"
name="pb327">327</a>]</span>people of the family, with the usual
consumption of liquor. Of course, the Kudang (who is the medium of
communication between the spirits of the dead and the living) is on the
spot, and communicates with the Kulba. If the deceased left debts, he,
through the Kudang, tells how they should be settled. Perhaps the Kulba
asks for tobacco and liquor, and these are given to the Kudang, who
keeps the tobacco, and drinks the liquor. After the Limma, a miniature
hut is built for the Kulba over the spot where the bones are buried.
But this is not done in places like Kolakotta, where there is a special
hut set apart for the Kulba. In some parts of the Saora country, a few
logs with grass on the top of them, logs again on the top to keep the
grass in its place, are laid over the buried fragments of bones, it is
said to be for keeping rain off, or dogs from disturbing the bones. In
the evening previous to the Limma, bitter food&mdash;the fruits or
leaves of the margosa tree (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>)&mdash;are eaten.
They do not like this bitter food, and partake of it at no other time.
[The same custom, called pithapona, or bitter food, obtains among the
Oriya inhabitants of the plains.] After the Limma, the Kulba returns to
the house of the deceased, but it is not supposed to remain there
always. The second feast to the dead, also sacrificial, is called the
Guar. For this, a buffalo, a large quantity of grain, and all the
necessary elements and accompaniments of a feast are required. It is a
much larger affair than the Limma, and all the relations, and perhaps
the villagers, join in. The evening before the Guar, there is a small
feast in the house for the purpose of calling together all the
previously deceased members of the family, to be ready for the Guar on
the following day. The great feature of the Guar is the erection of a
stone in memory of the deceased. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328"
href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span>From 50 to 100 yards
(sometimes a little more) from the houses occupied by a family may be
seen clusters of stones standing upright in the ground, nearly always
under a tree. Every one of the stones has been put up at one of these
Guar feasts. There is a great deal of drinking and dancing. The men,
armed with all their weapons, with their feathers in their hair, and
adorned with coloured cloths, accompanied by the women, all dancing as
they go, leave the house for the place where the stones are. Music
always accompanies the dancing. At Kolakotta there is another thatched
hut for the Kulba at the stones. The stone is put up in the
deceased&rsquo;s name at about 11 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, and at
about 2 P.M. a buffalo is killed close to it. The head is cut off with
an axe, and blood is put on the stone. The stones one sees are
generally from 1&frac12; to 4 feet high. There is no connection between
the size of the stone and the importance of the deceased person. As
much of the buffalo meat as is required for the feast is cooked, and
eaten at the spot where the stones are. The uneaten remains are taken
away by the relatives. In the evening the people return to the village,
dancing as they go. The Kolakotta people told me they put up the stones
under trees, so that they can have all their feasting in the shade.
Relations exchange compliments by presenting one another with a buffalo
for the Guar feast, and receive one in return on a future occasion. The
Guar is supposed to give the Kulba considerable satisfaction, and it
does not injure people as it did before. But, as the Guar does not
quite satisfy the Kulba, there is the great biennial feast to the dead.
Every second year (I am still speaking of Kolakotta) is performed the
Karja or biennial feast to the dead, in February or March, after the
crops are cut. All the Kolakotta Saoras join <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>in
this feast, and keep up drinking and dancing for twelve days. During
these days, the Kudangs eat only after sunset. Guns are continually
fired off, and the people give themselves up to sensuality. On the last
day, there is a great slaughter of buffaloes. In front of every house
in which there has been a death in the previous two years, at least one
buffalo, and sometimes two or three, are killed. Last year (1886) there
were said to be at least a thousand buffaloes killed in Kolakotta on
the occasion of the Karja. The buffaloes are killed in the afternoon.
Some grain is cooked in the houses, and, with some liquor, is given to
the Kudangs, who go through a performance of offering the food to the
Kulbas, and a man&rsquo;s or a woman&rsquo;s cloth, according as the
deceased is a male or female, is at this time given to the Kudang for
the Kulba of each deceased person, and of course the Kudang keeps the
offerings. The Kudang then tells the Kulba to begone, and trouble the
inmates no more. The house people, too, sometimes say to the Kulba
&lsquo;We have now done quite enough for you: we have given you
buffaloes, liquor, food, and cloths; now you must go&rsquo;. At about 8
P.M., the house is set fire to, and burnt. Every house, in which there
has been a death within the last two years, is on this occasion burnt.
After this, the Kulba gives no more trouble, and does not come to
reside in the new hut that is built on the site of the burnt one. It
never hurts grown people, but may cause some infantile diseases, and is
easily driven away by a small sacrifice. In other parts of the Saora
country, the funeral rites and ceremonies are somewhat different to
what they are in Kolakotta. The burning of bodies, and burning of the
fragments of the bones, is the same everywhere in the Saora country. In
one village the Saoras said the bones were buried until <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>another person died, when the first man&rsquo;s
bones were dug up and thrown away, and the last person&rsquo;s bones
put in their place. Perhaps they did not correctly convey what they
meant. I once saw a gaily ornamented hut, evidently quite new, near a
burning-place. Rude figures of birds and red rags were tied to five
bamboos, which were sticking up in the air about 8 feet above the hut,
one at each corner, and one in the centre, and the bamboos were split,
and notched for ornament. The hut was about 4&frac12; feet square, on a
platform three feet high. There were no walls, but only four pillars,
one at each corner, and inside a loft just as in a Saora&rsquo;s hut. A
very communicative Saora said he built the hut for his brother after he
had performed the Limma, and had buried the bones in the raised
platform in the centre of the hut. He readily went inside, and showed
what he kept there for the use of his dead brother&rsquo;s Kulba. On
the loft were baskets of grain, a bottle of oil for his body, a brush
to sweep the hut; in fact everything the Kulba wanted. Generally, where
it is the custom to have a hut for the Kulba, such hut is furnished
with food, tobacco, and liquor. The Kulba is still a Saora, though a
spiritual one. In a village two miles from that in which I saw the
gaily ornamented hut, no hut of any kind is built for the Kulba; the
bones are merely covered with grass. Weapons, ornaments, etc., are
rarely burned with a body outside the Kolakotta villages. In some
places, perhaps one weapon, or a few ornaments will be burned with it.
In some places the Limma and Guar feasts are combined, and in other
places (and this is most common) the Guar and Karja are combined, but
there is no burning of houses. In some places this is performed if
crops are good. One often sees, placed against the upright stones to
the dead, pieces of ploughs for male Kulbas, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>baskets for sifting grain for female Kulbas. I
once came across some hundreds of Saoras performing the Guar Karja.
Dancing, with music, fantastically dressed, and brandishing their
weapons, they returned from putting up the stones to the village, and
proceeded to hack to pieces with their axes the buffaloes that had been
slaughtered&mdash;a disgusting sight. After dark, many of the feasters
passed my camp on their way home, some carrying legs and other large
pieces of the sacrificed buffaloes, others trying to dance in a drunken
way, swinging their weapons. During my last visit to Kolakotta, I
witnessed a kind of combination of the Limma and Guar (an uncommon
arrangement there) made owing to peculiar circumstances. A deceased
Saora left no family, and his relatives thought it advisable to get
through his Limma and Guar without delay, so as to run no risk of the
non-performance of these feasts. He had been dead about a month. The
Limma was performed one day, the feast calling together the deceased
ancestors the same evening; and the Guar on the following day. Part of
the Limma was performed in a house. Three men, and a female Kudang sat
in a row; in front of them there was an inverted pot on the ground, and
around it were small leaf cups containing portions of food. All chanted
together, keeping excellent time. Some food in a little leaf cup was
held near the earthen pot, and now and then, as they sang, passed round
it. Some liquor was poured on the food in the leaf cup, and put on one
side for the Kulba. The men drank liquor from the leaf cups which had
been passed round the earthen pot. After some silence there was a long
chant, to call together all spirits of ancestors who had died violent
deaths, and request them to receive the spirit of the deceased among
them; and portions of food and liquor <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb332" href="#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span>were put aside for
them. Then came another long chant, calling on the Kulbas of all
ancestors to come, and receive the deceased and not to be angry with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is stated<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4818src" href="#xd21e4818"
name="xd21e4818src">27</a> that, in the east of Gunupur, the Savaras
commit much cattle theft, partly, it is said, because custom enjoins
big periodical sacrifices of cattle to their deceased ancestors. In
connection with the Guar festival, Mr. Ramamurti Pantulu writes that
well-to-do individuals offer each one or two animals, while, among the
poorer members of the community, four or five subscribe small sums for
the purchase of a buffalo, and a goat. &ldquo;There are,&rdquo; he
continues, &ldquo;special portions of the sacrificed animals, which
should, according to custom, be presented to those that carried the
dead bodies to the grave, as well as to the B&#333;ya and G&#333;mong.
If a man is hanged, a string is suspended in the house on the occasion
of the Guar, so that the spirit may descend along it. If a man dies of
wounds caused by a knife or iron weapon, a piece of iron or an arrow is
thrust into a rice-pot to represent the deceased.&rdquo; I gather
further that, when a Savara dies after a protracted illness, a pot is
suspended by a string from the roof of the house. On the ground is
placed a pot, supported on three stones. The pots are smeared with
turmeric paste, and contain a brass box, chillies, rice, onions, and
salt. They are regarded as very sacred, and it is believed that the
ancestors sometimes visit them.</p>
<p>Concerning the religion of the Savaras, Mr. Fawcett notes that their
name for deity is Sonnum or Sunnam, and describes the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Jalia. In some places thought to be male, and in others female.
The most widely known, very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href=
"#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span>malevolent, always going about
from one Saora village to another causing illness or death; in some
places said to eat people. Almost every illness that ends in death in
three or four days is attributed to Jalia&rsquo;s malevolence. When
mangoes ripen, and before they are eaten cooked (though they may be
eaten raw), a sacrifice of goats, with the usual drinking and dancing,
is made to this deity. In some villages, in the present year (1887),
there were built for the first time, temples&mdash;square thatched
places without walls&mdash;in the villages. The reason given for
building in the villages was that Jalia had come into them. Usually
erections are outside villages, and sacrifice is made there, in order
that Jalia may be there appeased, and go away. But sometimes he will
come to a village, and, if he does, it is advisable to make him
comfortable. One of these newly built temples was about four feet
square, thatched on the top, with no walls, just like the hut for
departed spirits. A Saora went inside, and showed us the articles kept
for Jalia&rsquo;s use and amusement. There were two new cloths in a
bamboo box, two brushes of feathers to be held in the hand when
dancing, oil for the body, a small looking-glass, a bell, and a lamp.
On the posts were some red spots. Goats are killed close by the temple,
and the blood is poured on the floor of the platform thereof. There are
a few villages, in or near which there are no Jalia erections, the
people saying that Jalia does not trouble them, or that they do not
know him. In one village where there was none, the Saoras said there
had been one, but they got tired of Jalia, and made a large sacrifice
with numerous goats and fowls, burnt his temple, and drove him out.
Jalia is fond of tobacco. Near one village is an upright stone in front
of a little Jalia temple, by a path-side, for passers-by to leave the
ends of their cheroots on for Jalia. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb334" href="#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span></p>
<p>(2) Kitung. In some parts there is a story that this deity produced
all the Saoras in Orissa, and brought them with all the animals of the
jungles to the Saora country. In some places, a stone outside the
village represents this deity, and on it sacrifices are made on certain
occasions to appease this deity. The stone is not worshipped. There are
also groves sacred to this deity. The Uriyas in the Saora hills also
have certain sacred groves, in which the axe is never used.</p>
<p>(3) Rathu. Gives pains in the neck.</p>
<p>(4) Dharma Boja, L&#257;nkan (above), Ayungang (the sun). The first
name is, I think, of Uriya origin, and the last the real Saora name.
There is an idea in the Kolakotta country that it causes all births.
This deity is not altogether beneficent, and causes sickness, and may
be driven away by sacrifices. In some villages, this deity is almost
the only one known. A Saora once told me, on my pointing to Venus and
asking what it was, that the stars are the children of the sun and
moon, and one day the sun said he would eat them all up. Woman-like,
the moon protested against the destruction of her progeny, but was
obliged to give in. She, however, managed to hide Venus while the
others were being devoured. Venus was the only planet he knew. In some
parts, the sun is not a deity.</p>
<p>(5) Kanni. Very malevolent. Lives in big trees, so they are never
cut in groves which this deity is supposed to haunt. I frequently saw a
Saora youth of about 20, who was supposed to be possessed by this
deity. He was an idiot, who had fits. Numerous buffaloes had been
sacrificed to Kanni, to induce that deity to leave the youth, but to no
purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many hill deities known in certain
localities&mdash;D&#275;r&#275;m&#257;, supposed to be on the Deodangar
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>hill, the highest in the neighbourhood, Khistu,
Kinchinyung, Ilda, Lobo, Kondho, Balu, Baradong, etc. These deities of
the hills are little removed from the spirits of the deceased Saoras.
[Mr. Ramamurti Pantulu refers to two hills, one at Gayaba called
Jum-tang Baru, or eat cow hill, and the other about eight miles from
Parlakimedi, called Media Baru. At the former, a cow or bull is
sacrificed, because a Kuttung once ate the flesh of a cow there; at the
latter the spirits require only milk and liquor. This is peculiar, as
the Savaras generally hold milk in abhorrence.]&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is invariably one fetish, and generally there are
several fetishes in every Saora house. In some villages, where the sun
is the chief deity (and causes most mischief), there are fetishes of
the sun god; in another village, fetishes of Jalia, Kitung, etc. I once
saw six Jalia fetishes, and three other fetishes in one house. There
are also, especially about Kolakotta, Kulba fetishes in houses. The
fetish is generally an empty earthen pot, about nine inches in
diameter, slung from the roof. The Kudang slings it up. On certain
occasions, offerings are made to the deity or Kulba represented by the
fetish on the floor underneath it. Rude pictures, too, are sometimes
fetishes. The fetish to the sun is generally ornamented with a rude
pattern daubed in white on the outside. In the village of Bori in the
Vizagapatam Agency, offerings are made to the sun fetish when a member
of the household gets pains in the legs or arms, and the fetish is said
on such occasion to descend of itself to the floor. Sacrifices are
sometimes made inside houses, under the fetishes, sometimes at the
door, and blood put on the ground underneath the fetish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. Ramamurti Pantulu that &ldquo;the Kittungs are
ten in number, and are said to be all <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span>brothers. Their names
are Bh&#299;ma, R&#257;ma, Jodepulu, P&#275;da, Rung-rung, Tumanna,
Garsada, Jaganta, Mutta, and Tete. On some occasions, ten figures of
men, representing the Kittungs, are drawn on the walls of a house.
Figures of horses and elephants, the sun, moon and stars, are also
drawn below them. The B&#333;ya is also represented. When a woman is
childless, or when her children die frequently, she takes a vow that
the Kittungpurpur ceremony shall be celebrated, if a child is born to
her, and grows in a healthy state. If this comes to pass, a young pig
is purchased, and marked for sacrifice. It is fattened, and allowed to
grow till the child reaches the age of twelve, when the ceremony is
performed.</p>
<p>The Madras Museum possesses a series of wooden votive offerings
which were found stacked in a structure, which has been described to me
as resembling a pigeon-cot. The offerings consisted of a lizard
(<i>Varanus</i>), paroquet, monkey, peacock, human figures, dagger,
gun, sword, pick-axe, and musical horn. The Savaras would not sell them
to the district officer, but parted with them on the understanding that
they would be worshipped by the Government.</p>
<p>I gather that, at the sale or transfer of land, the spirits are
invoked by the B&#333;ya, and, after the distribution of liquor, the
seller or mortgager holds a p&#299;pal (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus
religiosa</i>) leaf with a lighted wick in it in his hand, while the
purchaser or mortgagee holds another leaf without a wick. The latter
covers the palm of the former with his leaf, and the terms of the
transaction are then announced.</p>
<p>Concerning the performance of sacrifices, Mr. Fawcett writes that
&ldquo;the Saoras say they never practiced human sacrifice. Most Saora
sacrifices, which are also feasts, are made to appease deities or
Kulbas that have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337"
name="pb337">337</a>]</span>done mischief. I will first notice the few
which do not come in this category. (<i>a</i>) The feast to Jalia when
mangoes ripen, already mentioned, is one. In a village where the sun,
and not Jalia, is the chief deity, this feast is made to the sun. Jalia
does not trouble the village, as the Kudung meets him outside it now
and then, and sends him away by means of a sacrifice. [Sacrifices and
offerings of pigs or fowls, rice, and liquor, are also made at the
mahua, hill grain, and red gram festivals.] (<i>b</i>) A small
sacrifice, or an offering of food, is made in some places before a
child is born. About Kolakotta, when a child is born, a fowl or a pound
or so of rice, and a quart of liquor provided by the people of the
house, will be taken by the Kudang to the jungle, and the fowl
sacrificed to Kanni. Blood, liquor, and rice are left in leaf cups for
Kanni, and the rest is eaten. In every paddy field in Kolakotta, when
the paddy is sprouting, a sacrifice is made to Satt&#299;ra for good
crops. A stick of the tree called in Uriya kendhu, about five or six
feet long, is stuck in the ground. The upper end is sharpened to a
point, on which is impaled a live young pig or a live fowl, and over it
an inverted earthen pot daubed over with white rings. If this sacrifice
is not made, good crops cannot be expected. [It may be noted that the
impaling of live pigs is practiced in the Telugu country.]<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4867src" href="#xd21e4867" name=
"xd21e4867src">28</a> When crops ripen, and before the grain is eaten,
sacrifice is made to Lobo (the earth). Lobo Sonnum is the earth deity.
If they eat the grain without performing this sacrifice, it will
disagree with them, and will not germinate properly when sown again. If
crops are good, a goat is killed, if not good, a pig or a fowl. A
Kolakotta Saora told me of another <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338"
href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>sacrifice, which is partly of
a propitiatory nature. If a tiger or panther kills a person, the Kudang
is called, and he, on the following Sunday, goes through a performance,
to prevent a similar fate overtaking others. Two pigs are killed
outside the village, and every man, woman, and child is made to walk
over the ground whereon the pig&rsquo;s blood is spilled, and the
Kudang gives to each individual some kind of tiger medicine as a charm.
The Kudang communicates with the Kulba of the deceased, and learns the
whole story of how he met his death. In another part of the Saora
country, the above sacrifice is unknown; and, when a person is killed
by a tiger or panther, a buffalo is sacrificed to the Kulba of the
deceased three months afterwards. The feast is begun before dark, and
the buffalo is killed the next morning. No medicine is used. Of
sacrifices <i>after</i> injury is felt, and in order to get rid of it,
that for rain may be noticed first. The G&#333;mango, another important
man in the village, and the Kudang officiate. A pig and a goat are
killed outside the village to Kitung. The blood must flow on the stone.
Then liquor and grain are set forth, and a feast is made. About
Kolakotta the belief in the active malevolence of Kulbas is more
noticeable than in other parts, where deities cause nearly all
mischief. Sickness and death are caused by deities or Kulbas, and it is
the Kudang who ascertains which particular spirit is in possession of,
or has hold of any sick person, and informs him what is to be done in
order to drive it away. He divines in this way usually. He places a
small earthen saucer, with a little oil and lighted wick in it, in the
patient&rsquo;s hand. With his left hand he holds the patient&rsquo;s
wrist, and with his right drops from a leaf cup grains of rice on to
the flame. As each grain drops, he calls out the name of different
deities, and Kulbas, and, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href=
"#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>whichever spirit is being named as
a grain catches fire, is that causing the sickness. The Kudang is at
once in communication with the deity or Kulba, who informs him what
must be done for him, what sacrifice made before he will go away. There
is, in some parts of the Saora country, another method by which a
Kudang divines the cause of sickness. He holds the patient&rsquo;s hand
for a quarter of an hour or so, and goes off in a trance, in which the
deity or Kulba causing the sickness communicates with the Kudang, and
says what must be done to appease him. The Kudang is generally, if not
always, fasting when engaged in divination. If a deity or Kulba refuses
to go away from a sick person, another more powerful deity or Kulba can
be induced to turn him out.</p>
<p>A long account of a big sacrifice is given by Mr. Fawcett, of which
the following is a summary. The Kudang was a lean individual of about
40 or 45, with a grizzled beard a couple of inches in length. He had a
large bunch of feathers in his hair, and the ordinary Saora waist-cloth
with a tail before and behind. There were tom-toms with the party. A
buffalo was tied up in front of the house, and was to be sacrificed to
a deity who had seized on a young boy, and was giving him fever. The
boy&rsquo;s mother came out with some grain, and other necessaries for
a feed, in a basket on her head. All started, the father of the boy
carrying him, a man dragging the buffalo along, and the Kudang driving
it from behind. As they started, the Kudang shouted out some gibberish,
apparently addressed to the deity, to whom the sacrifice was to be
made. The party halted in the shade of some big trees. They said that
the sacrifice was to the road god, who would go away by the path after
the sacrifice. Having arrived at the place, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span>woman set down her basket, the men laid down
their axes and the tom-toms, and a fire was lighted. The buffalo was
tied up 20 yards off on the path, and began to graze. After a quarter
of an hour, the father took the boy in his lap as he sat on the path,
and the Kudang&rsquo;s assistant sat on his left with a tom-tom before
him. The Kudang stood before the father on the path, holding a small
new earthen pot in his hand. The assistant beat the tom-tom at the rate
of 150 beats to the minute. The Kudang held the earthen pot to his
mouth, and, looking up to the sun (it was 9 <span class=
"sc">A.M.</span>), shouted some gibberish into it, and then danced
round and round without leaving his place, throwing up the pot an inch
or so, and catching it with both hands, in perfect time with the
tom-tom, while he chanted gibberish for a quarter of an hour.
Occasionally, he held the pot up to the sun, as if saluting it, shouted
into it, and passed it round the father&rsquo;s head and then round the
boy&rsquo;s head, every motion in time with the tom-tom. The chant
over, he put down the pot, and took up a toy-like bow and arrow. The
bow was about two feet long, through which was fixed an arrow with a
large head, so that it could be pulled only to a certain extent. The
arrow was fastened to the string, so that it could not be detached from
the bow. He then stuck a small wax ball on to the point of the arrow
head, and, dancing as before, went on with his chant accompanied by the
tom-tom. Looking up at the sun, he took aim with the bow, and fired the
wax ball at it. He then fired balls of wax, and afterwards other small
balls, which the Uriyas present said were medicine of some kind, at the
boy&rsquo;s head, stomach, and legs. As each ball struck him, he cried.
The Kudang, still chanting, then went to the buffalo, and fired a wax
ball at its head. He came back <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341"
href="#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span>to where the father was
sitting, and, putting down the bow, took up two thin pieces of wood a
foot long, an inch wide, and blackened at the ends. The chant ceased
for a few moments while he was changing the bow for the pieces of wood,
but, when he had them in his hands, he went on again with it, dancing
round as before, and striking the two pieces of wood together in time.
This lasted about five minutes, and, in the middle of the dance, he put
an umbrella-like shade on his head. The dance over, he went to the
buffalo, and stroked it all over with the two pieces of wood, first on
the head, then on the body and rump, and the chant ceased. He then sat
in front of the boy, put a handful of common herbs into the earthen
pot, and poured some water into it. Chanting, he bathed the boy&rsquo;s
head with the herbs and water, the father&rsquo;s head, the boy&rsquo;s
head again, and then the buffalo&rsquo;s head, smearing them with the
herbs. He blew into one ear of the boy, and then into the other. The
chant ceased, and he sat on the path. The boy&rsquo;s father got up,
and, carrying the boy, seated him on the ground. Then, with an axe,
which was touched by the sick boy, he went up to the buffalo, and with
a blow almost buried the head of the axe in the buffalo&rsquo;s neck.
He screwed the axe about until he disengaged it, and dealt a second and
a third blow in the same place, and the buffalo fell on its side. When
it fell, the boy&rsquo;s father walked away. As the first blow was
given, the Kudang started up very excited as if suddenly much overcome,
holding his arms slightly raised before him, and staggered about. His
assistant rushed at him, and held him round the body, while he
struggled violently as if striving to get to the bleeding buffalo. He
continued struggling while the boy&rsquo;s father made his three blows
on the buffalo&rsquo;s neck. The father brought <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>him
some of the blood in a leaf cup, which he greedily drank, and was at
once quiet. Some water was then given him, and he seemed to be all
right. After a minute or so, he sat on the path with the tom-tom before
him, and, beating it, chanted as before. The boy&rsquo;s father
returned to the buffalo, and, with a few more whacks at it, stopped its
struggles. Some two or three men joined him, and, with their axes and
swords, soon had the buffalo in pieces. All present, except the Kudang,
had a good feed, during which the tom-tom ceased. After the feed,
Kudang went at it again, and kept it up at intervals for a couple of
hours. He once went for 25 minutes at 156 beats to the minute without
ceasing.</p>
<p>A variant of the ceremonial here described has been given to me by
Mr. G. F. Paddison from the Gunapur hills. A buffalo is tied up to the
door of the house, where the sick person resides. Herbs and rice in
small platters, and a little brass vessel containing toddy, balls of
rice, flowers, and medicine, are brought with a bow and arrow. The
arrow is thicker at the basal end than towards the tip. The narrow part
goes, when shot, through a hole in the bow, too small to allow of
passage of the rest of the arrow. The B&#275;ju (wise woman) pours
toddy over the herbs and rice, and daubs the sick person over the
forehead, breasts, stomach, and back. She croons out a long incantation
to the goddess, stopping at intervals to call out &ldquo;Daru,&rdquo;
to attract her attention. She then takes the bow and arrow, and shoots
into the air. She then stands behind the kneeling patient, and shoots
balls of medicine stuck on the tip of the arrow at her. The
construction of the arrow is such that the balls are dislodged from the
tip of the arrow. The patient is thus shot at all over the body, which
is bruised by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343"
name="pb343">343</a>]</span>impact of the balls. Afterwards the
B&#275;ju shoots one or two balls at the buffalo, which is taken to a
path forming the village boundary, and killed with a tangi (axe). The
patient is then daubed with blood of the buffalo, rice and toddy. A
feast concludes the ceremonial.</p>
<p>The following account of a sacrifice to Rathu, who had given fever
to the sister of the celebrant Kudang, is given by Mr. Fawcett.
&ldquo;The Kudang was squatting, facing west, his fingers in his ears,
and chanting gibberish with continued side-shaking of his head. About
two feet in front of him was an apparatus made of split bamboo. A young
pig had been killed over it, so that the blood was received in a little
leaf cup, and sprinkled over the bamboo work. The Kudang never ceased
his chant for an hour and a half. While he was chanting, some eight
Saoras were cooking the pig with some grain, and having a good feed.
Between the bamboo structure and the Kudang were three little leaf
cups, containing portions of the food for Rathu. A share of the food
was kept for the Kudang, who when he had finished his chant, got up and
ate it. Another performance, for which some dried meat of a buffalo
that had been sacrificed a month previously was used, I saw on the same
day. Three men, a boy, and a baby, were sitting in the jungle. The men
were preparing food, and said that they were about to do some reverence
to the sun, who had caused fever to some one. Portions of the food were
to be set out in leaf cups for the sun deity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded by Mr. Ramamurti Pantulu that, when children are
seriously ill and become emaciated, offerings are made to monkeys and
blood-suckers (lizards), not in the belief that illness is caused by
them, but because the sick child, in its emaciated state, resembles an
attenuated figure of these animals. Accordingly, a blood-sucker is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>captured, small toy arrows are tied round its
body, and a piece of cloth is tied on its head. Some drops of liquor
are then poured into its mouth, and it is set at liberty. In
<span class="corr" id="xd21e4902" title=
"Source: negociating">negotiating</span> with a monkey, some rice and
other articles of food are placed in small baskets, called tanurjal,
which are suspended from branches of trees in the jungle. The Savaras
frequently attend the markets or fairs held in the plains at the foot
of the gh&#257;ts to purchase salt and other luxuries. If a Savara is
taken ill at the market or on his return thence, he attributes the
illness to a spirit of the market called Biradi Sonum. The bulls, which
carry the goods of the Hindu merchants to the market, are supposed to
convey this spirit. In propitiating it, the Savara makes an image of a
bull in straw, and, taking it out of his village, leaves it on the
foot-path after a pig has been <span class="corr" id="xd21e4905" title=
"Source: sacrified">sacrificed</span> to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each group of Savaras,&rdquo; Mr. Ramamurti writes, &ldquo;is
under the government of two chiefs, one of whom is the G&#333;mong (or
great man) and the other, his colleague in council, is the B&#333;ya,
who not only discharges, in conjunction with the G&#333;mong, the
duties of magistrate, but also holds the office of high priest. The
offices of these two functionaries are hereditary, and the rule of
primogeniture regulates succession, subject to the principle that
incapable individuals should be excluded. The presence of these two
officers is absolutely necessary on occasions of marriages and
funerals, as well as at harvest festivals. Sales and mortgages of land
and liquor-yielding trees, partition and other dispositions of
property, and divorces are effected in the council of village elders,
presided over by the G&#333;mong and B&#333;ya, by means of long and
tedious proceedings involving various religious ceremonies. All cases
of a civil and criminal nature are heard and disposed of by them. Fines
are imposed as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>a punishment for all sorts of offences. These
invariably consist of liquor and cattle, the quantity of liquor and the
number of animals varying according to the nature of the offence. The
murder of a woman is considered more heinous than the murder of a man,
as woman, being capable of multiplying the race, is the more useful. A
thief, while in the act of stealing, may be shot dead. It is always the
man, and not the woman, that is punished for adultery. Oaths are
administered, and ordeals prescribed. Until forty or fifty years ago,
it is said that the Savara magistrate had jurisdiction in murder cases.
He was the highest tribunal in the village, the only arbitrator in all
transactions among the villagers. And, if any differences arose between
his men and the inhabitants of a neighbouring village, for settling
which it was necessary that a battle should be fought, the G&#333;mong
became the commander, and, leading his men, contested the cause with
all his might. These officers, though discharging such onerous and
responsible duties, are regarded as in no special degree superior to
others in social position. They enjoy no special privileges, and
receive no fees from the suitors who come up to their court. Except on
occasions of public festivals, over which they preside, they are
content to hold equal rank with the other elders of the village. Each
cultivates his field, and builds his house. His wife brings home fuel
and water, and cooks for his family; his son watches his cattle and
crops. The English officials and the Bissoyis have, however, accorded
to these Savara officers some distinction. When the Governor&rsquo;s
Agent, during his annual tour, invites the Savara elders to bh&#275;ti
(visit), they make presents of a fowl, sheep, eggs, or a basket of
rice, and receive cloths, necklaces, etc. The Bissoyis exempt them from
personal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>service, which is demanded from all
others.&rdquo; At the Sankaranthi festival, the Savaras bring loads of
firewood, yams (<i>Dioscorea</i> tubers), pumpkins, etc., as presents
for the Bissoyi, and receive presents from him in return.</p>
<p>Besides cultivating, the Savaras collect <i>Bauhinia</i> leaves, and
sell them to traders for making leaf platters. The leaves of the
jel-adda tree (<i>Bauhinia purpurea</i>) are believed to be
particularly appreciated by the Savara spirits, and offerings made to
them should be placed in cups made thereof. The Savaras also collect
various articles of minor forest produce, honey and wax. They know how
to distil liquor from the flowers of the mahua (<i>Bassia
latifolia</i>). The process of distillation has been thus
described.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4928src" href="#xd21e4928" name=
"xd21e4928src">29</a> &ldquo;The flowers are soaked in water for three
or four days, and are then boiled with water in an earthenware chatty.
Over the top of this is placed another chatty, mouth downwards, the
join between the two being made air-tight by being tied round with a
bit of cloth, and luted with clay. From a hole made in the upper
chatty, a hollow bamboo leads to a third pot, specially made for the
purpose, which is globular, and has no opening except that into which
the bamboo pipe leads. This last is kept cool by pouring water
constantly over it, and the distillate is forced into it through the
bamboo, and there condenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a report on his tour through the Savara country in 1863, the
Agent to the Governor of Madras reported as follows. &ldquo;At Gunapur
I heard great complaints of the thievish habits of the Soura tribes on
the hills dividing Gunapur from Pedda Kimedy. They are not dacoits, but
very expert burglers, if the term can be applied to digging a hole in
the night through a mud wall. If <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347"
href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>discovered and hard pressed,
they do not hesitate to discharge their arrows, which they do with
unerring aim, and always with fatal result. Three or four murders have
been perpetrated by these people in this way since the country has been
under our management. I arranged with the Superintendent of Police to
station a party of the Armed Reserve in the ghaut leading to Soura
country. One or two cases of seizure and conviction will suffice to put
a check to the crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district, that
&ldquo;in 1864 trouble occurred with the Savaras. One of their headmen
having been improperly arrested by the police of Pottasingi, they
effected a rescue, killed the Inspector and four constables, and burnt
down the station-house. The R&#257;ja of Jeypore was requested to use
his influence to procure the arrest of the offenders, and eventually
twenty-four were captured, of whom nine were transported for life, and
five were sentenced to death, and hanged at Jalt&#275;ru, at the foot
of the gh&#257;t to Pottasingi. Government presented the R&#257;ja with
a rifle and other gifts in acknowledgment of his assistance. The
country did not immediately calm down, however, and, in 1865, a body of
police, who were sent to establish a post in the hills, were attacked,
and forced to beat a retreat down the gh&#257;t. A large force was then
assembled, and, after a brief but harassing campaign, the post was
firmly occupied in January, 1866. Three of the ringleaders of this
rising were transported for life. The hill Savaras remained timid and
suspicious for some years afterwards, and, as late as 1874, the reports
mention it as a notable fact that they were beginning to frequent
markets on the plains, and that the low-country people no longer feared
to trust themselves above the gh&#257;ts.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span></p>
<p>In 1905, Government approved the following proposals for the
improvement of education among the Savaras and other hill tribes in the
Ganjam and Vizagapatam Agencies, so far as Government schools are
concerned:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) That instruction to the hill tribes should be given orally
through the medium of their own mother tongue, and that, when a Savara
knows both Uriya and Telugu, it would be advantageous to educate him in
Uriya;</p>
<p>(2) That evening classes be opened whenever possible, the buildings
in which they are held being also used for night schools for adults who
should receive oral instruction, and that magic-lantern exhibitions
might be arranged for occasionally, to make the classes attractive;</p>
<p>(3) That concessions, if any, in the matter of grants admissible to
Savaras, Khonds, etc., under the Grant-in-aid Code, be extended to the
pupils of the above communities that attend schools in the plains;</p>
<p>(4) That an itinerating agency, who could go round and look after
the work of the agency schools, be established and that, in the
selection of hill school establishments, preference be given to men
educated in the hill schools;</p>
<p>(5) That some suitable form of manual occupation be introduced,
wherever possible, into the day&rsquo;s work, and the schools be
supplied with the requisite tools, and that increased grants be given
for anything original.</p>

Savadamma, the goddess of the weaver caste in Coimbatore, is narrated
by Bishop Whitehead.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4972src" href=
"#xd21e4972" name="xd21e4972src">30</a> &ldquo;Once upon a time, when
there was fierce conflict between the men and the r&#257;kshasas, the
men, who were getting defeated, applied for help to the god Siva, who
sent his wife Parvati as an avatar or incarnation into the world to
help them. The avatar enabled them to defeat the r&#257;kshasas, and,
as the weaver caste were in the forefront of the battle, she became the
goddess of the weavers, and was known in consequence as Savadamman, a
corruption of S&#275;dar Amman, S&#275;dan being a title of the
weavers. It is said that her original home was in the north of India,
near the Himalayas.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Segidi.&mdash;</b>The Segidis are a Telugu caste of toddy sellers
and distillers of arrack, who are found mainly in Ganjam and
Vizagapatam.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the Madras Abk&#257;ri Act, toddy means
fermented or unfermented juice drawn from a cocoanut, palmyra, date, or
any other kind of palm-tree. It is laid down, in the Madras Excise
Manual, that &ldquo;unfermented toddy is not subject to any taxation,
but it must be drawn in pots freshly coated internally with lime. Lime
is prescribed as the substance with which the interior of pots or other
receptacles in which sweet toddy is drawn should be coated, as it
checks the fermentation of the toddy coming in contact with it; but
this effect cannot be secured unless the internal lime <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>coating of the toddy pot or vessel is thorough,
and is renewed every time that the pot is emptied of its
contents.&rdquo; It is noted by Bishop Caldwell<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4983src" href="#xd21e4983" name="xd21e4983src">31</a> that
&ldquo;it is the unfermented juice of the palmyra (and other palms)
which is used as food. When allowed to ferment, which it will do before
midday, if left to itself, it is changed into a sweet intoxicating
drink called kal or toddy.&rdquo; Pietro Della Valle records<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4986src" href="#xd21e4986" name=
"xd21e4986src">32</a> that he stayed on board till nightfall,
&ldquo;entertaining with conversation and drinking tari, a liquor which
is drawn from the cocoanut trees, of a whitish colour, a little turbid,
and of a somewhat rough taste, though with a blending in sweetness, and
not unpalatable, something like one of our <i>vini piccanti</i>. It
will also intoxicate, like wine, if drunk over freely.&rdquo; Writing
in 1673, Fryer<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4992src" href="#xd21e4992"
name="xd21e4992src">33</a> describes the Natives as &ldquo;singing and
roaring all night long; being drunk with toddy, the wine of the
Cocoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrack is a spirituous liquor distilled from the fermented sap of
various palms. In some parts of the Madras Presidency, arrack vendors
consider it unlucky to set their measures upside down. Some time ago,
the Excise Commissioner informs me, the Excise department had some
aluminium measures made for measuring arrack in liquor shops. It was
found that the arrack corroded the aluminium, and the measures soon
leaked. The shopkeepers were told to turn their measures upside down,
in order that they might drain. This they refused to do, as it would
bring bad luck to their shop. New measures with round bottoms were
evolved, which would not stand up. But the shopkeepers began to use
rings of india-rubber from soda-water bottles, to make them stand. An
endeavour has since been made to induce <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb351" href="#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span>them to keep their
measures inverted by hanging them on pegs, so that they will drain
without being turned upside down. The case illustrates well how
important a knowledge of the superstitions of the people is in the
administration of their affairs.</p>
<p>The Segidis do not draw the liquor from the palm-tree themselves,
but purchase it from the toddy-drawing castes, the Y&#257;tas and
Gamallas.</p>
<p>They have a caste headman, called Kulampedda, who settles disputes
with the assistance of a council. Like other Telugu castes, they have
intip&#275;rulu or house names, which are strictly exogamous. Girls are
married either before or after puberty. The custom of m&#275;narikam is
practiced, in accordance with which a man marries his maternal
aunt&rsquo;s daughter. A Br&#257;hman officiates at marriages, except
the remarriage of widows. When a widow is remarried, the caste-men
assemble, and the Kulampedda ties the satham&#257;nam (marriage badge)
on the bride&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>The dead are usually cremated, and the washerman of the village
assists the chief mourner in igniting the pyre. A S&#257;t&#257;ni
conducts the funeral ceremonies.</p>
<p>The Segidis worship various village deities, and
p&#275;rant&#257;lammas, or women who killed themselves during their
husbands&rsquo; lives or on their death.</p>
<p>The more well-to-do members of the caste take the title Anna.</p>
<p><b>Sekk&#257;n</b> (oil-man).&mdash;A synonym of V&#257;niyan.</p>
<p><b>Sembadavan.&mdash;</b>The Sembadavans are the fishermen of the
Tamil country, who carry on their calling in freshwater tanks (ponds),
lakes and rivers, and never in the sea. Some of them are ferrymen, and
the name has been derived from sem (good), padavan (boatmen). A legend
runs to the effect that the goddess <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb352" href="#pb352" name="pb352">352</a>]</span>Ankalamman, whom they
worship with offerings of sheep, pigs, fowls, rice, etc., was a
Sembadava girl, of whom Siva became enamoured, and Sembadavan is
accordingly derived from Sambu (Siva) or a corruption of Sivan padavan
(Siva&rsquo;s boatmen). Some members of the caste in the Telugu country
returned themselves, at the census, 1901, as Sambuni Reddi or
K&#257;pu. According to another legend, the name is derived from sembu
padavor or copper boatmen. Parvatha R&#257;ja, disguised as a boatman,
when sailing in a copper boat, threw out his net to catch fish. Four
V&#275;das were transformed into nets, with which to catch the
r&#257;kshasas, who assumed the form of fishes. Within the nets a rishi
was also caught, and, getting angry, asked the boatman concerning his
pedigree. On learning it, he cursed him, and ordained that his
descendants should earn their living by fishing. Hence the Sembadavans
call themselves Parvatha R&#257;javamsam. Yet another legend states
that the founder of the caste, while worshipping God, was tried thus.
God caused a large fish to appear in the water near the spot at which
he was worshipping. Forgetting all about his prayers, he stopped to
catch the fish, and was cursed with the occupation of catching fish for
ever. According to yet another account of the origin of the
Sembadavans, Siva was much pleased with their ancestors&rsquo; devotion
to him when they lived upon the sea-shore by catching a few fish with
difficulty, and in recognition of their piety furnished them with a
net, and directed various other castes to become fish-eaters, so that
the Sembadavar might live comfortably.</p>
<p>Of the Sembadavans of the North Arcot district, Mr. H. A. Stuart
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5022src" href="#xd21e5022" name=
"xd21e5022src">34</a> that they &ldquo;act as boatmen <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>and
fishers. They have little opportunity of exercising the former
profession, but during heavy freshes in big rivers they ferry people
from bank to bank in round leather-covered basket coracles, which they
push along, swimming or wading by the side, or assist the timid to ford
by holding their hands. At such times they make considerable hauls.
During the rest of the year they subsist by fishing in the
tanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sembadavans of the South Arcot district,&rdquo; Mr.
Francis writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5029src" href="#xd21e5029"
name="xd21e5029src">35</a> &ldquo;are fresh-water fishermen and
boatmen. Both their occupations being of a restricted character, they
have now in some cases taken to agriculture, weaving, and the hawking
of salted sea-fish, but almost all of them are poor. They make their
own nets, and, when they have to walk any distance for any purpose,
they often spin the thread as they go along. Their domestic priests are
Panch&#257;ngi Br&#257;hmans, and these tie the t&#257;li at weddings,
and perform the purificatory ceremonies on the sixteenth day after
deaths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sembadavans consider themselves to be superior to Pattanavans,
who are sea-fishermen. They usually take the title N&#257;ttan,
Kavandan, Maniyakk&#257;ran, Paguththar, or Pillai. Some have assumed
the title Guha Vell&#257;la, to connect themselves with Guha, who rowed
the boat of R&#257;ma to Ceylon. At the census, 1901, Savalakk&#257;ran
(<i>q.v.</i>) was returned as a sub-caste. Savalalai or saval thadi is
the flattened paddle for rowing boats. A large number call themselves
P&#363;j&#257;ri, (priest), and wear the lingam enclosed in a silver
casket or pink cloth, and the sacred thread. It is the p&#363;j&#257;ri
who officiates at the temple services to village deities. At
Malayan&#363;r, in the South Arcot district, all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span>the
Sembadavans call themselves p&#363;j&#257;ri, and seem to belong to a
single sept called Mukk&#257;li (three-legged).</p>
<p>Most of the Sembadavans call themselves Saivites, but a few,
<i>e.g.</i>, at Kuppam in North Arcot, and other places, say that they
are Vaishnavites, and belong to Vishnu g&#333;tram. Even among those
who claimed to be Vaishnavites, a few were seen with a sandal paste
(Saivite) mark on the forehead. Their explanation was that they were
returning from the fields, where they had eaten their food. This they
must not do without wearing a religious emblem, and they had not with
them the mirror, red powder, water, etc., necessary for making the
Vaishnavite n&#257;mam mark. They asserted that they never take a girl
in marriage from Saivite families without burning her tongue with a
piece of gold, and purifying her by puny&#257;v&#257;chanam.</p>
<p>The Sembadavans at Chidambaram are all Saivites, and point out with
pride their connection with the temple. It appears that, on a
particular day, they are deputed to carry the idol in procession
through the streets, and their services are paid for with a modest fee
and a ball of cooked rice for each person. Some respect is shown to
them by the temple authorities, as the goddess, when being carried in
procession, is detained for some time in their quarters, and they make
presents of female cloths to the idol.</p>
<p>The Sembadavans have exogamous septs, named after various heroes,
etc. The office of N&#257;ttan or N&#257;ttamaikk&#257;ran (headman) is
confined to a particular sept, and is hereditary. In some places he is
assisted by officers called Sangathikkar or Sangathipillai, through
whom, at a council, the headman should be addressed. At their council
meetings, representatives of the seven n&#257;dus (villages), into
which the Sembadavans of various <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355"
href="#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span>localities are divided, are
present. At Malayan&#363;r these n&#257;dus are replaced by seven
exogamous septs, viz., D&#275;var, Seppiliyan, Eth&#299;n&#257;yakan,
Sangili, M&#257;yakundali, Pattam, and Panikkan. If a man under trial
pleads not guilty to the charge brought against him, he has to bear the
expenses of the members of council. Sometimes, as a punishment, a man
is made to carry a basket of rubbish, with tamarind twigs as the emblem
of flogging, and a knife to denote cutting of the tongue. Women are
said to be punished by having to carry a basket of rubbish and a broom
round the village.</p>
<p>Sembadavans who are ferrymen by profession do special worship to
Ganga, the goddess of water, to whom pongal (rice) and goats are
offered. It is believed that their immunity from death by drowning,
caused by the upsetting of their leather coracles, is due to the
protection of the goddess.</p>
<p>The ceremonial when a girl reaches puberty corresponds to that of
various other Tamil castes. Meat is forbidden, but eggs are allowed to
be eaten. To ward off devils twigs of <i>Vitex Negundo</i>, margosa
(<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>), and <i>Eugenia Jambolana</i> are stuck in
the roof. Sometimes a piece of iron is given to the girl to keep.
During the marriage ceremonies, a branch of <i>Erythrina indica</i> is
cut, and tied, with sprays of the p&#299;pal (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>)
and a piece of a green bamboo culm, to one of the twelve posts, which
support the marriage pandal (booth). A number of sumangalis (married
women) bring sand, and spread it on the floor near the marriage dais,
with pots, two of which are filled with water, over it. The bride and
bridegroom go through a ceremony called sige kazhippu, with the object
of warding off the evil eye, which consists in pouring a few drops of
milk on their foreheads from a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356"
href="#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span>fig or betel leaf. To their
foreheads are tied small gold or silver plates, called pattam, of which
the most conspicuous are those tied by the maternal uncles. The plate
for the bridegroom is V-shaped like a n&#257;mam, and that for the
bride like a p&#299;pal leaf. The bride and bridegroom go through a
mock ceremony representative of domestic life, and pot-searching. Seven
rings are dropped into a pot. If the girl picks up three of these, her
first-born will be a girl. If the bridegroom picks up five, it will be
a boy. Married women go in procession to an ant-hill, and bring to the
marriage booth a basket-load of the earth, which they heap up round the
posts. Offerings of balls of rice, cooked vegetables, etc., are then
made. After the wrist-threads (kankanam) have been removed, the bride
and bridegroom go to a tank, and go through a mock ploughing ceremony.
In some places, the pur&#333;hits give the bridegroom a sacred thread,
which is finally thrown into a tank or well.</p>
<p>By some Sembadavans a ceremony, called muthugunir kuththal (pouring
water on the back) is performed in the seventh month of pregnancy. The
woman stands on the marriage dais, and red-coloured water, and lights
are waved. Bending down, she places her hands on two big pots, and milk
is poured over her back from a betel leaf by all her relations.</p>
<p>The Vaishnava Sembadavans burn, and the Saivites bury their dead in
a sitting posture. Fire is carried to the burial-ground by the barber.
In cases of burial the face is covered over by a cloth, in which a slit
is made, so that the top of the head and a portion of the forehead are
exposed. A figure representing Gan&#275;sa is made on the head with
ashes. All present throw sacred ashes, and a pie (copper coin) into the
grave, which is then filled in. While this is being done, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>bamboo stick is placed upright on the head of
the corpse. On the surface of the filled-in grave an oblong space is
cleared, with the bamboo in the centre. The bamboo is then removed, and
water poured through the hole left by it, and a lingam made, and placed
over the opening.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Sembadavan Mayana Kollai.</p>
</div>
<p>At Malayan&#363;r a ceremony called may&#257;na or smas&#257;na
kollai (looting the burning-ground) is performed. The village of
Malayan&#363;r is famous for its Ankalamman temple, and, during the
festival which takes place immediately after the Sivar&#257;tri, some
thousands of people congregate at the temple, which is near the
burning-ground. In front of the stone idol is a large ant-hill, on
which two copper idols are placed, and a brass vessel, called
korakk&#363;dai, is placed at the base of the hill, to receive the
various votive offerings. Early in the day, the p&#363;j&#257;ri (a
Sembadavan) goes to a tank, and brings a decorated pot, called
p&#363;ngkaragam, to the temple. Offerings are made to a new pot, and,
after a sheep has been sacrificed, the pot is filled with water, and
carried on the head of the p&#363;j&#257;ri, who shows signs of
possession by the deity, through the streets of the village to the
temple, dancing wildly, and never touching the pot with his hands. It
is believed that the pot remains on the head, without falling, through
the influence of the goddess. When the temple is reached, another
p&#363;j&#257;ri takes up a framework, to which are tied a head made of
rice flour, with three faces coloured white, black and red,
representing the head of Brahma which was cut off by Siva, and a pot
with three faces on it. The eyes of the flour figure are represented by
hen&rsquo;s eggs. The pot is placed beneath the head. Carrying the
framework, and accompanied by music, the p&#363;j&#257;ri goes in
procession to the burning-ground, and, after <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span>offerings of a sheep, arrack, betel and fruits
have been made to the head of Brahma, it is thrown away. Close to the
spot where corpses are burnt, the p&#363;j&#257;ris place on the ground
five conical heaps (representing Gan&#275;sa), made of the ashes of a
corpse. To these are offered the various articles brought by those who
have made vows, which include cooked pulses, bangles, betel, parts of
the human body modelled in rice flour, etc. The offerings are piled up
in a heap, which is said to reach ten or twelve feet in height. Soon
afterwards, the people assembled fall on the heap, and carry off
whatever they can secure. Hundreds of persons are said to become
possessed, eat the ashes of the corpses, and bite any human bones,
which they may come across. The ashes and earth are much prized, as
they are supposed to drive away evil spirits, and secure offspring to
barren women. Some persons make a vow that they will disguise
themselves as Siva, for which purpose they smear their faces with
ashes, put on a cap decorated with feathers of the crow, egret, and
peacock, and carry in one hand a brass vessel called Brahma
kap&#257;lam. Round their waist they tie a number of strings, to which
are attached rags and feathers. Instead of the cap, Paraiyans and
Valluvans wear a crown. The brass vessel, cap, and strings are said to
be kept by the p&#363;j&#257;ri, and hired out for a rupee or two per
head. The festival is said to be based on the following legend. Siva
and Brahma had the same number of faces. During the swayamvaram,
Parvati, the wife of Siva, found it difficult to recognise her husband,
so Siva cut off Brahma&rsquo;s head. The head stuck on to Siva&rsquo;s
hand, and he could not get rid of it. To get rid of the skull, and
throw off the crime of murder, Siva wandered far and wide, and came to
the burning-ground at Malayan&#363;r, where various bh&#363;thas
(devils) were busy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359"
name="pb359">359</a>]</span>eating the remains of corpses. Parvati also
arrived there, and failed to recognise Siva. Thereon the skull laughed,
and fell to the ground. The bh&#363;thas were so delighted that they
put various kinds of herbs into a big vessel, and made of them a sweet
liquor, by drinking which Siva was absolved from his crime. For this
reason arrack is offered to him at the festival. A very similar rite is
carried out at Walajapet. A huge figure, representing the goddess, is
made at the burning-ground out of the ashes of burnt bodies mixed with
water, the eyes being made of hen&rsquo;s eggs painted black in the
centre to represent the pupils. It is covered over with a yellow cloth,
and a sweet-smelling powder (kadampam) is sprinkled over it. The
following articles, which are required by a married woman, are placed
on it:&mdash;a comb, pot containing colour-powder, glass bangles, rolls
of palm leaf for dilating the ear-lobes, and a string of black beads.
Devotees present as offerings limes, plantains, arrack, toddy,
sugar-cane, and various kinds of cooked grains, and other eatables. The
goddess is taken in procession from her shrine to the burning-ground,
and placed in front of the figure. The p&#363;j&#257;ri (fisherman),
who wears a special dress for the occasion, walks in front of the idol,
carrying in one hand a brass cup representing the skull which Siva
carried in his hand, and in the other a piece of human skull bone,
which he bites and chews as the procession moves onward. When the
burning-ground is reached, he performs p&#363;ja by breaking a
cocoanut, and going round the figure with lighted camphor in his hand.
Goats and fowls are sacrificed. A woman, possessed by a devil, seats
herself at the feet of the figure, and becomes wild and agitated. The
p&#363;ja completed, the assembled multitude fall on the figure, and
carry off whatever they can grab of the articles placed on it, which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>are believed to possess healing and other
virtues. They also smear their bodies with the ashes. The
p&#363;j&#257;ri, and some of the devotees, then become possessed, and
run about the burning-ground, seizing and gnawing partly burnt bones.
Tradition runs to the effect that, in olden times, they used to eat the
dead bodies, if they came across any. And the people are so afraid of
their doing this that, if a death should occur, the corpse is not taken
to the burning-ground till the festival is over. &ldquo;In some
cases,&rdquo; Herbert Spencer writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5092src" href="#xd21e5092" name="xd21e5092src">36</a>
&ldquo;parts of the dead are swallowed by the living, who seek thus to
inspire themselves with the good qualities of the dead; and we saw that
the dead are supposed to be honoured by this act.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Sembun&#257;du.&mdash;</b>The name, meaning the P&#257;ndya
country, of a sub-division of Maravan.</p>
<p><b>Semmadi.&mdash;</b>A Telugu form of Sembadavan.</p>
<p><b>Semm&#257;n.&mdash;</b>The Semm&#257;ns are described, in the
Madras Census Report, 1891, as &ldquo;an insignificant caste of Tamil
leather-workers, found only in the districts of Madura and Tinnevelly
(and in the Puduk&#333;tta&#299; State). Though they have returned
tailor and lime-burner as their occupations, the original occupation
was undoubtedly leather-work. In the Tamil dictionaries Semm&#257;n is
explained as a leather-worker, and a few of them, living in out-of-the
way villages, have returned shoe-making as their occupation. The
Semm&#257;ns are, in fact, a sub-division of the Paraiyans, and they
must have been the original leather-workers of the Tamil tribes. The
immigrant Chakkiliyans have, however, now taken their place.&rdquo; The
Semm&#257;ns are described, in the Madura Manual, as burning and
selling lime for building <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href=
"#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>purposes. In the Census Report,
1901, the caste is said to have &ldquo;two hypergamous sub-divisions,
Tondam&#257;n and T&#333;lm&#275;stri, and men of the former take wives
from the latter, but men of the latter may not marry girls of the
former.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Girls are married after puberty, and divorce and remarriage are
freely allowed. As the caste is a polluting one, the members thereof
are not allowed to use village wells, or enter caste Hindu temples. The
caste title is M&#275;stri.</p>
<p><b>Sem Puli</b> (red tiger).&mdash;A section of Kallan.</p>
<p><b>S&#275;naikkudaiy&#257;n.&mdash;</b>The S&#275;naikkudaiy&#257;ns
are betel vine (<i>Piper Betel</i>) cultivators and betel leaf sellers,
who are found in large numbers in the Tinnevelly district, and to a
smaller extent in other parts of the Tamil country. The original name
of the caste is said to have been Elai (leaf) V&#257;niyan, for which
the more high-sounding S&#275;naikkudaiy&#257;n (owner of an army) or
S&#275;naittalavan (chief of an army) has been substituted. They also
called themselves Kodikk&#257;l Pillaimar, or Pillaimars who cultivate
betel gardens, and have adopted the title Pillai. The titles Muppan and
Chetti are also borne by members of the caste.</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, that &ldquo;the
priests of the S&#275;naikkudaiy&#257;ns are Vell&#257;las, and
occasionally Br&#257;hmans. They do not wear the sacred thread. They
burn their dead, and perform annual sr&#257;ddhas (memorial services).
In 1891, following the Tanjore Manual, they were wrongly classed with
V&#257;niyans or oil-mongers, but they are superior to these in social
position, and are even said to rank above N&#257;ttuk&#333;ttai
Chettis. Yet it is stated that, in Tanjore, Paraiyans will not enter
the S&#275;naikkudaiy&#257;ns&rsquo; houses to carry away dead cattle,
and ordinary barbers will not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362"
href="#pb362" name="pb362">362</a>]</span>serve them, and food prepared
by them will not be accepted even by barbers or washermen. Somewhat
similar anomalies occur in the case of the Kamm&#257;las, and the
explanation may be that these two castes belonged to the old left-hand
faction, while the Pariyans, and the barbers and washermen belonged to
the right-hand. Paraiyans similarly will not eat in the houses of
B&#275;ri Chettis, who were of the left-hand faction.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>S&#275;napati.&mdash;</b>A title, denoting commander-in-chief,
said to be sold to Kh&#333;duras, and also occurring as a title of
other Oriya castes, <i>e.g.</i>, Kurumo and Ronguni. Among the
Rongunis, the title is practically an exogamous sept. S&#275;napati is
further a name for S&#257;l&#275;s (Telugu weavers), the headman among
whom is called Pedda (big) S&#275;napati. The headman of the
S&#257;l&#257;pu weavers, who do not intermarry with the
S&#257;l&#275;s, is also styled S&#275;napati. It is also a title of
the R&#257;ja of Sand&#363;r.</p>
<p><b>Sendalai</b> (red-headed man).&mdash;Returned as a sub-division
of Konga Vell&#257;las at times of census.</p>
<p><b>Sengundam</b> (red dagger).&mdash;A synonym, connected with a
caste legend, of Kaik&#333;lan.</p>
<p><b>Seniga</b> (Bengal gram: <i>Cicer arietinum</i>).&mdash;An
exogamous sept of M&#275;dara and Pedakanti K&#257;pu.</p>
<p><b>S&#275;niyan.&mdash;</b>The name S&#275;niyan is generally used
to denote the Karna S&#257;l&#275; weavers, but at Conjeeveram it is
applied to Canarese D&#275;v&#257;ngas. Elsewhere Canarese
D&#275;v&#257;ngas belong to the left-hand section, but at Conjeeveram
they are classed with the right-hand section. Like other
D&#275;v&#257;ngas, the Conjeeveram S&#275;niyans have exogamous
house-names and g&#333;tras, which are interesting inasmuch as new
names have been, in recent times, substituted for the original ones,
<i>e.g.</i>, Chandras&#275;khara rishi, N&#299;lakanta rishi,
Markand&#275;ya rishi. The D&#275;v&#257;ngas claim Markand&#275;ya as
their ancestor. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363"
name="pb363">363</a>]</span>old house-name Picchi Kaya (water-melon:
<i>Citrullus vulgaris</i>) has been changed to Desimarada, and eating
the melon is tabu. A list of the house-names and g&#333;tras is kept by
the headman for reference. The Conjeeveram S&#275;niyans are
Ling&#257;yats, but are not so strict as the Canarese Ling&#257;yats.
Jangams are respected, but rank after their own stone lingams. In the
observance of death rites, a staunch Ling&#257;yat should not bathe,
and must partake of the food offered to the corpse. These customs are
not observed by the S&#275;niyans. Until quite recently, a man might
tie a t&#257;li (marriage badge) secretly on a girl&rsquo;s neck, with
the consent of the headman and his relatives, and the girl could then
be given in marriage to no other man. This custom is said to have been
very common, especially in the case of a man&rsquo;s maternal
uncle&rsquo;s or paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter. At Conjeeveram it was
extended to girls not so related, and a caste council was held, at
which an agreement was drawn up that the secret t&#257;li-tying was
forbidden, and, if performed, was not to be regarded as binding. The
priest of the Conjeeveram S&#275;niyans is a Vell&#257;la
Pand&#257;ram, who is the head of the Tirugn&#257;na Sambanda Murti
mutt (religious institution) at Conjeeveram.</p>
<p><b>S&#275;rvai.&mdash;</b>S&#275;rvai, meaning service, has been
recorded as the title of Agamudaiyans and Valaiyans.
S&#275;rvaik&#257;ran or S&#275;rvaig&#257;ran (captain or commander)
is the title of Agamudaiyan, Ambalak&#257;ran, Kallan, Maravan, and
Pariv&#257;ram. It further occurs as the name for a headman among the
Vallambans, and it has been adopted as a false caste name by some
criminal Koravas in the south.</p>
<p><b>Serv&#275;g&#257;ra.&mdash;</b>The Serv&#275;g&#257;ras are a
caste found in South Canara, and to a small extent in Bellary.
&ldquo;They are said to be a branch of the Konkan Mar&#257;this of Goa,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>from whence they were invited by the
Ling&#257;yat kings of Nagara to serve as soldiers and to defend their
forts (k&#333;t&#275;), whence the alternative name of
K&#333;t&#275;yava (or K&#333;t&#275;g&#257;ra). Another name for them
is R&#257;makshatri. The mother-tongue of the Serv&#275;g&#257;ras of
South Canara is Canarese, while their brethren in the north speak
Konkani. They have now taken to cultivation, but some are employed in
the Revenue and Police departments as peons (orderlies) and constables,
and a few are shopkeepers. The name Serv&#275;g&#257;ra is derived from
the Canarese serv&#275;, an army. In religion they are Hindus, and,
like most West Coast castes, are equally partial to the worship of Siva
and Vishnu. They wear the sacred thread. Kar&#257;di Br&#257;hmans are
their priests, and they owe allegiance to the head of the Sring&#275;ri
mutt. Their girls are married before puberty, and the remarriage of
widows is neither allowed nor practiced. Divorce is permitted only on
the ground of the unchastity of the wife. The body of a child under
three years is buried, and that of any person exceeding that age is
cremated. They eat flesh, but do not drink. Their titles are
N&#257;yak, Aiya, Rao, and Sheregar.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p><b>Sh&#257;n&#257;n.&mdash;</b>The great toddy-drawing caste of the
Tamil country, which, a few years ago, came into special <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span>prominence owing to the Tinnevelly riots in
1899. &ldquo;These were,&rdquo; the Inspector-General of Police
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5199src" href="#xd21e5199" name=
"xd21e5199src">38</a> &ldquo;due to the pretensions of the
Sh&#257;n&#257;ns to a much higher position in the religio-social scale
than the other castes are willing to allow. Among other things, they
claimed admission to Hindu temples, and the manager of the
Visvanath&#275;swara temple at Sivak&#257;si decided to close it. This
partial victory of the Sh&#257;n&#257;ns was keenly resented by their
opponents, of whom the most active were the Maravans. Organised attacks
were made on a number of the Sh&#257;n&#257;n villages; the inhabitants
were assailed; houses were burnt; and property was looted. The most
serious occurrence was the attack on Sivak&#257;si by a body of over
five thousand Maravans. Twenty-three murders, 102 dacoities, and many
cases of arson were registered in connection with the riots in
Sivak&#257;si, Chinniapuram, and other places. Of 1,958 persons
arrested, 552 were convicted, 7 being sentenced to death. One of the
ring-leaders hurried by train to distant Madras, and made a clever
attempt to prove an alibi by signing his name in the Museum
visitor&rsquo;s book. During the disturbance some of the
Sh&#257;n&#257;ns are said to have gone into the Muhammadan fold. The
men shaved their heads, and grew beards; and the women had to make
sundry changes in their dress. And, in the case of boys, the operation
of circumcision was performed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The immediate bone of contention at the time of the Tinnevelly riots
was, the Census Superintendent, 1901, writes, &ldquo;the claim of the
Sh&#257;n&#257;ns to enter the Hindu temples, in spite of the rules in
the Agama Sh&#257;stras that toddy-drawers are not to be allowed into
them; but the pretensions of the community date back <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span>from
1858, when a riot occurred in Travancore, because female Christian
converts belonging to it gave up the caste practice of going about
without an upper cloth.&rdquo; On this point Mr. G. T. Mackenzie
informs us<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5206src" href="#xd21e5206" name=
"xd21e5206src">39</a> that &ldquo;in the first quarter of the
nineteenth century, the female converts to Christianity in the extreme
south ventured, contrary to the old rules for the lower castes, to
clothe themselves above the waist. This innovation was made the
occasion for threats, violence, and series of disturbances. Similar
disturbances arose from the same cause nearly thirty years later, and,
in 1859, Sir Charles Trevelyan, Governor of Madras, interfered, and
granted permission to the women of the lower castes to wear a cloth
over the breasts and shoulders. The following proclamation was issued
by the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja of Travancore:&mdash;We hereby proclaim that
there is no objection to Sh&#257;n&#257;n women either putting on a
jacket like the Christian Sh&#257;n&#257;n women, or to
Sh&#257;n&#257;n women of all creeds dressing in coarse cloth, and
tying themselves round with it as the Mukkavattigal (fisherwomen) do,
or to their covering their bosoms in any manner whatever, but not like
women of high castes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shortly after 1858, pamphlets began
to be written and published by people of the caste, setting out their
claims to be Kshatriyas. In 1874 they endeavoured to establish a right
to enter the great M&#299;n&#257;kshi temple at Madura, but failed, and
they have since claimed to be allowed to wear the sacred thread, and to
have palanquins at their weddings. They say they are descended from the
Ch&#275;ra, Ch&#333;la and P&#257;ndya kings; they have styled
themselves Kshatriyas in legal papers; labelled their schools Kshatriya
academy; got Br&#257;hmans of the less particular <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>kind
to do pur&#333;hit&rsquo;s work for them; had poems composed on their
kingly origin; gone through a sort of incomplete parody of the ceremony
of investiture with the sacred thread; talked much but ignorantly of
their g&#333;tras; and induced needy persons to sign documents agreeing
to carry them in palanquins on festive occasions.&rdquo; [During my
stay at Nazareth in Tinnevelly, for the purpose of taking measurements
of the Sh&#257;n&#257;ns, I received a visit from some elders of the
community from Kuttam, who arrived in palanquins, and bearing weapons
of old device.] Their boldest stroke was to aver that the coins
commonly known as Sh&#257;n&#257;ns&rsquo; cash were struck by
sovereign ancestors of the caste. The author of a pamphlet entitled
&lsquo;Bishop Caldwell and the Tinnevelly Sh&#257;n&#257;rs&rsquo;
states that he had met with men of all castes who say that they have
seen the true Sh&#257;n&#257;r coin with their own eyes, and that a
Eurasian gentleman from Bangalore testified to his having seen a true
Sh&#257;n&#257;r coin at Bangalore forty years ago. The coin referred
to is the gold Venetian sequin, which is still found in considerable
numbers in the south, and bears the names of the Doges (Paul Rainer,
Aloy Mocen, Ludov Manin, etc.) and a cross, which the Natives mistake
for a toddy palm. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; Mr. Fawcett writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5211src" href="#xd21e5211" name=
"xd21e5211src">40</a> &ldquo;one asks the ordinary Malay&#257;li
(native of Malabar) what persons are represented on the sequin, one
gets for answer that they are R&#257;ma and S&#299;ta: between them a
cocoanut tree. Every Malay&#257;li knows what an &#256;m&acirc;da is;
it is a real or imitation Venetian sequin. I have never heard any
explanation of the word &#256;m&acirc;da in Malabar. The following
comes from Tinnevelly. &#256;m&acirc;da was the consort of Bhagavati,
and he suddenly appeared one day <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368"
href="#pb368" name="pb368">368</a>]</span>before a Sh&#257;n&#257;r,
and demanded food. The Sh&#257;n&#257;r said he was a poor man with
nothing to offer but toddy, which he gave in a palmyra leaf.
&#256;m&acirc;da drank the toddy, and performing a mantram (consecrated
formula) over the leaf, it turned into gold coins, which bore on one
side the pictures of &#256;m&acirc;da, the Sh&#257;n&#257;r, and the
tree, and these he gave to the Sh&#257;n&#257;r as a reward for his
willingness to assist him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a petition to myself from certain Sh&#257;n&#257;ns of Nazareth,
signed by a very large number of the community, and bearing the title
&ldquo;Short account of the Cantras or Tamil X&#257;tr&#257;s, the
original but down-trodden royal race of Southern India,&rdquo; they
write as follows. &ldquo;We humbly beg to say that we are the
descendants of the P&#257;ndya or Dravida Xatra race, who, shortly
after the universal deluge of Noah, first disafforested and colonized
this land of South India under the guidance of Agastya Muni. The whole
world was destroyed by flood about B.C. 3100 (Dr. Hale&rsquo;s
calculation), when Noah, otherwise called Vaivasvata-manu or
Satyavrata, was saved with his family of seven persons in an ark or
covered ship, which rested upon the highest mountain of the
&#256;ry&#257;varta country. Hence the whole earth was rapidly
replenished by his descendants. One of his grandsons (nine great
Praj&#257;patis) was Atri, whose son Candra was the ancestor of the
noblest class of the Xatras ranked above the Brahmans, and the first
illustrious monarch of the post-diluvian world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently,&rdquo; the Census Superintendent continues,
&ldquo;judging from the Sh&#257;n&#257;n&rsquo;s own published
statements of their case, they rest their claims chiefly upon
etymological derivations of their caste name Sh&#257;n&#257;n, and of
N&#257;d&#257;n and Gr&#257;mani, their two usual titles. Caste titles
and names are, however, of recent origin, and little <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span>can
be inferred from them, whatever their meaning may be shown to be.
Br&#257;hmans, for example, appear to have borne the titles of Pillai
and Mudali, which are now only used by S&#363;dras, and the N&#257;yak
kings, on the other hand, called themselves Aiyar, which is now
exclusively the title of Saivite Br&#257;hmans. To this day the
cultivating Vell&#257;las, the weaving Kaik&#333;lars, and the
semi-civilised hill tribe of the J&#257;tapus use equally the title of
Mudali, and the Balijas and Telagas call themselves Rao, which is
properly the title of Mahr&#257;tta Br&#257;hmans. Regarding the
derivation of the words Sh&#257;n&#257;n, N&#257;d&#257;n and
Gr&#257;mani, much ingenuity has been exercised. Sh&#257;n&#257;n is
not found in the earlier Tamil literature at all. In the inscriptions
of R&#257;jar&#257;ja Ch&#333;la (A. D. 984&ndash;1013) toddy-drawers
are referred to as &#298;luvans. According to Pingalandai, a dictionary
of the 10th or 11th century, the names of the toddy-drawer castes are
Palaiyar, Tuvasar, and Paduvar. To these the Ch&#363;d&#257;mani
Nikandu, a Tamil dictionary of the 16th century, adds Saundigar.
Apparently, therefore, the Sanskrit word Saundigar must have been
introduced (probably by the Br&#257;hmans) between the 11th and 16th
centuries, and is a Sanskrit rendering of the word &#298;luvan. From
Saundigar to Sh&#257;n&#257;n is not a long step in the corruption of
words. The Sh&#257;n&#257;ns say that Sh&#257;n&#257;n is derived from
the Tamil word S&#257;nr&#257;r or S&#257;nr&#333;r, which means the
learned or the noble. But it does not appear that the Sh&#257;n&#257;ns
were ever called S&#257;nr&#257;r or S&#257;nr&#333;r in any of the
Tamil works. The two words N&#257;d&#257;n and Gr&#257;mani mean the
same thing, namely, ruler of a country or of a village, the former
being a Tamil, and the latter a Sanskrit word. N&#257;d&#257;n, on the
other hand, means a man who lives in the country, as opposed to
&#362;r&#257;n, the man who resides in a village. The title of the
caste is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name=
"pb370">370</a>]</span>N&#257;d&#257;n, and it seems most probable that
it refers to the fact that the &#298;luvan ancestors of the caste lived
outside the villages. (South Indian Inscriptions, vol. II, part 1.)
But, even if N&#257;d&#257;n and Gr&#257;mani both mean rulers, it does
not give those who bear these titles any claim to be Kshatriyas. If it
did, all the descendants of the many South Indian Poligars, or petty
chiefs, would be Kshatriyas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Census Superintendent, 1891, states that the
&ldquo;Sh&#257;n&#257;ns are in social position usually placed only a
little above the Pallas and the Paraiyans, and are considered to be one
of the polluting castes, but of late many of them have put forward a
claim to be considered Kshatriyas, and at least 24,000 of them appear
as Kshatriyas in the caste tables. This is, of course, absurd, as there
is no such thing as a Dravidian Kshatriya. But it is by no means
certain that the Sh&#257;n&#257;ns were not at one time a warlike
tribe, for we find traces of a military occupation among several
toddy-drawing castes of the south, such as the Billavas (bowmen),
Hal&#275;paik (old foot soldiers), Kum&#257;rapaik (junior foot). Even
the Kadamba kings of Mysore are said to have been toddy-drawers.
&lsquo;The Kadamba tree appears to be one of the palms, from which
toddy is extracted. Toddy-drawing is the special occupation of the
several primitive tribes spread over the south-west of India, and
bearing different names in various parts. They were employed by former
rulers as foot-soldiers and bodyguards, being noted for their
fidelity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5226src" href="#xd21e5226" name=
"xd21e5226src">41</a>&rsquo; The word Sh&#257;n&#257;n is ordinarily
derived from Tamil s&#257;ru, meaning toddy; but a learned missionary
derives it from s&#257;n (a span) and n&#257;r (fibre or string), that
is the noose, one span in length, used <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb371" href="#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span>by the
Sh&#257;n&#257;ns in climbing palm-trees.&rdquo; The latter derivation
is also given by Vell&#257;las.</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that the Tiyans, or Malabar toddy-drawers,
address one another, and are addressed by the lower classes as
Sh&#275;n&#275;r, which is probably another form of
Sh&#257;n&#257;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5233src" href="#xd21e5233"
name="xd21e5233src">42</a></p>
<p>The whole story of the claims and pretensions of the
Sh&#257;n&#257;ns is set out at length in the judgment in the Kamudi
temple case (1898) which was heard on appeal before the High Court of
Madras. And I may appropriately quote from the judgment. &ldquo;There
is no sort of proof, nothing, we may say, that even suggests a
probability that the Sh&#257;n&#257;rs are descendants from the
Kshatriya or warrior castes of Hindus, or from the Pandiya, Chola or
Chera race of kings. Nor is there any distinction to be drawn between
the N&#257;dars and the Sh&#257;n&#257;rs. Sh&#257;n&#257;r is the
general name of the caste, just as Vell&#257;la and Maravar designate
castes. &lsquo;N&#257;dar&rsquo; is a mere title, more or less
honorific, assumed by certain members or families of the caste, just as
Br&#257;hmins are called Aiyars, Aiyangars, and Raos. All
&lsquo;N&#257;dars&rsquo; are Sh&#257;n&#257;rs by caste, unless indeed
they have abandoned caste, as many of them have by becoming Christians.
The Sh&#257;n&#257;rs have, as a class, from time immemorial, been
devoted to the cultivation of the palmyra palm, and to the collection
of the juice, and manufacture of liquor from it. There are no grounds
whatever for regarding them as of Aryan origin. Their worship was a
form of demonology, and their position in general social estimation
appears to have been just above that of Pallas, Pariahs, and Chucklies
(Chakkiliyans), who are on all hands regarded as unclean, and
prohibited from the use <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href=
"#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span>of the Hindu temples, and below
that of Vell&#257;las, Maravans, and other classes admittedly free to
worship in the Hindu temples. In process of time, many of the
Sh&#257;n&#257;rs took to cultivating, trade, and money-lending, and
to-day there is a numerous and prosperous body of Sh&#257;n&#257;rs,
who have no immediate concern with the immemorial calling of their
caste. In many villages they own much of the land, and monopolise the
bulk of the trade and wealth. With the increase of wealth they have,
not unnaturally, sought for social recognition, and to be treated on a
footing of equality in religious matters. The conclusion of the
Sub-Judge is that, according to the Agama Shastras which are received
as authoritative by worshippers of Siva in the Madura district, entry
into a temple, where the ritual prescribed by these Sh&#257;stras is
observed, is prohibited to all those whose profession is the
manufacture of intoxicating liquor, and the climbing of palmyra and
cocoanut trees. No argument was addressed to us to show that this
finding is incorrect, and we see no reason to think that it is so....
No doubt many of the Sh&#257;n&#257;rs have abandoned their hereditary
occupation, and have won for themselves by education, industry and
frugality, respectable positions as traders and merchants, and even as
vakils (law pleaders) and clerks; and it is natural to feel sympathy
for their efforts to obtain social recognition, and to rise to what is
regarded as a higher form of religious worship; but such sympathy will
not be increased by unreasonable and unfounded pretensions, and, in the
effort to rise, the Sh&#257;n&#257;rs must not invade the established
rights of other castes. They have temples of their own, and are
numerous enough, and strong enough in wealth and education, to rise
along their own lines, and without appropriating the institutions or
infringing the rights of others, and in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb373" href="#pb373" name="pb373">373</a>]</span>so doing they will
have the sympathy of all right-minded men, and, if necessary, the
protection of the Courts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the Sh&#257;n&#257;ns, the Rev. J. Sharrock
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5245src" href="#xd21e5245" name=
"xd21e5245src">43</a> that they &ldquo;have risen enormously in the
social scale by their eagerness for education, by their large adoption
of the freedom of Christianity, and by their thrifty habits. Many of
them have forced themselves ahead of the Maravars by sheer force of
character. They have still to learn that the progress of a nation, or a
caste, does not depend upon the interpretation of words, or the
assumption of a title, but on the character of the individuals that
compose it. Evolutions are hindered rather than advanced by such unwise
pretensions resulting in violence; but evolutions resulting from
intellectual and social development are quite irresistible, if any
caste will continue to advance by its own efforts in the path of
freedom and progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing in 1875, Bishop Caldwell remarks<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5250src" href="#xd21e5250" name="xd21e5250src">44</a> that
&ldquo;the great majority of the Sh&#257;n&#257;rs who remain heathen
wear their hair long; and, if they are not allowed to enter the
temples, the restriction to which they are subject is not owing to
their long hair, but to their caste, for those few members of the
caste, continuing heathens, who have adopted the kudumi&mdash;generally
the wealthiest of the caste&mdash;are as much precluded from entering
the temples as those who retain their long hairs. A large majority of
the Christian Sh&#257;n&#257;rs have adopted the kudumi together with
Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By Regulation XI, 1816, it was enacted that heads of villages have,
in cases of a trivial nature, such as abusive language and
inconsiderable assaults or affrays, power to confine the offending
members in the village <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href=
"#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>choultry (lock-up) for a time not
exceeding twelve hours; or, if the offending parties are of the lower
castes of the people, on whom it may not be improper to inflict so
degrading a punishment, to order them to be put in the stocks for a
time not exceeding six hours. In a case which came before the High
Court it was ruled that by &ldquo;lower castes&rdquo; were probably
intended those castes which, prior to the introduction of British rule,
were regarded as servile. In a case which came up on appeal before the
High Court in 1903, it was ruled that the Sh&#257;n&#257;rs belong to
the lower classes, who may be punished by confinement in the
stocks.</p>
<p>With the physique of the Sh&#257;n&#257;ns, whom I examined at
Nazareth and Sawyerp&#363;ram in Tinnevelly, and their skill in
physical exercises I was very much impressed. The programme of sports,
which were organised in my honour, included the following
events:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Fencing and figure exercises with long sticks of iron-wood
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Mesua ferrea</i>).</li>
<li>Figure exercises with sticks bearing flaming rags at each end.</li>
<li>Various acrobatic tricks.</li>
<li>Feats with heavy weights, rice-pounders, and pounding stones.</li>
<li>Long jump.</li>
<li>Breaking cocoanuts with the thrust of a knife or the closed
fist.</li>
<li>Crunching whiskey-bottle glass with the teeth.</li>
<li>Running up, and butting against the chest, back, and
shoulders.</li>
<li>Swallowing a long silver chain.</li>
<li>Cutting a cucumber balanced on a man&rsquo;s neck in two with a
sword.</li>
<li>Falconry.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name=

<p>One of the good qualities of Sir Thomas Munro, formerly Governor of
Madras, was that, like R&#257;ma and Rob Roy, his arms reached to his
knees, or, in other words, he possessed the kingly quality of an
Aj&#257;nub&#257;hu, which is the heritage of kings, or those who have
blue blood in them. This particular anatomical character I have met
with myself only once, in a Sh&#257;n&#257;n, whose height was 173 cm.
and span of the arms 194 cm. (+ 21 cm.). Rob Roy, it will be
remembered, could, without stooping, tie his garters, which were placed
two inches below the knee.</p>
<p>For a detailed account of demonolatry among the Sh&#257;n&#257;ns, I
would refer the reader to the Rev. R. (afterwards Bishop)
Caldwell&rsquo;s now scarce &lsquo;Tinnevelly Shanans&rsquo; (1849),
written when he was a young and impulsive missionary, and the
publication of which I believe that the learned and kind-hearted divine
lived to regret.</p>
<p>Those Sh&#257;n&#257;ns who are engaged in the palmyra (<i>Borassus
flabellifer</i>) forests in extracting the juice of the palm-tree climb
with marvellous activity and dexterity. There is a proverb that, if you
desire to climb trees, you must be born a Sh&#257;n&#257;n. A palmyra
climber will, it has been calculated, go up from forty to fifty trees,
each forty to fifty feet high, three times a day. The story is told by
Bishop Caldwell of a man who was sitting upon a leaf-stalk at the top
of a palmyra palm in a high wind, when the stalk gave way, and he came
down to the ground safely and quietly, sitting on the leaf, which
served the purpose of a natural parachute. Woodpeckers are called
Sh&#257;n&#257;ra kurivi by birdcatchers, because they climb trees like
Sh&#257;n&#257;rs. &ldquo;The Hindus,&rdquo; the Rev. (afterwards
Canon) A. Marg&ouml;schis writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5296src"
href="#xd21e5296" name="xd21e5296src">45</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=
"pb376">376</a>]</span>&ldquo;observe a special day at the commencement
of the palmyra season, when the jaggery season begins. Bishop Caldwell
adopted the custom, and a solemn service in church was held, when one
set of all the implements used in the occupation of palmyra-climbing
was brought to the church, and presented at the altar. Only the day was
changed from that observed by the Hindus. The perils of the
palmyra-climber are great, and there are many fatal accidents by
falling from trees forty to sixty feet high, so that a religious
service of the kind was particularly acceptable, and peculiarly
appropriate to our people.&rdquo; The conversion of a Hindu into a
Christian ceremonial rite, in connection with the dedication of <i>ex
votos</i>, is not devoid of interest. In a note<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5304src" href="#xd21e5304" name="xd21e5304src">46</a> on the
Pariah caste in Travancore, the Rev. S. Mateer narrates a legend that
the Sh&#257;n&#257;ns are descended from Adi, the daughter of a Pariah
woman at Karuvur, who taught them to climb the palm tree, and prepared
a medicine which would protect them from falling from the high trees.
The squirrels also ate some of it, and enjoy a similar immunity.</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that
Sh&#257;n&#257;n toddy-drawers &ldquo;employ Pallans, Paraiyans, and
other low castes to help them transport the liquor, but Musalmans and
Br&#257;hmans have, in several cases, sufficiently set aside the
scruples enjoined by their respective faiths against dealings in potent
liquor to own retail shops, and (in the case of some Musalmans at
least) to serve their customers with their own hands.&rdquo; In a
recent note,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5309src" href="#xd21e5309"
name="xd21e5309src">47</a> it has been stated that &ldquo;L.M.S.
Sh&#257;n&#257;r Christians have, in many cases, given up tapping the
palmyra palm for jaggery and toddy as a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb377" href="#pb377" name="pb377">377</a>]</span>profession beneath
them; and their example is spreading, so that a real economic
<i>impasse</i> is manifesting itself. The writer knows of one village
at least, which had to send across the border (of Travancore) into
Tinnevelly to procure professional tree-tappers. Consequent on this
want of professional men, the palm trees are being cut down, and this,
if done to any large extent, will impoverish the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the palmyra forests of Attitondu, in Tinnevelly, I came across a
troop of stalwart Sh&#257;n&#257;n men and boys, marching out towards
sunset, to guard the ripening ch&#333;lum crop through the night, each
with a trained dog, with leash made of fibre passed through a ring on
the neck-collar. The leash would be slipped directly the dog scented a
wild pig, or other nocturnal marauder. Several of the dogs bore the
marks of encounters with pigs. One of the party carried a musical
instrument made of a &lsquo;bison&rsquo; horn picked up in the
neighbouring jungle.</p>
<p>The Sh&#257;n&#257;ns have a great objection to being called either
Sh&#257;n&#257;n or Maram&#275;ri (tree-climber), and much prefer
N&#257;d&#257;n. By the Sh&#257;n&#257;ns of Tinnevelly, whom I
visited, the following five sub-divisions were returned:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Karukku-pattayar (those of the sharp sword), which is considered
to be superior to the rest. In the Census Report, 1891, the division
Karukku-mattai (petiole of the palmyra leaf with serrated edges) was
returned. Some Sh&#257;n&#257;ns are said to have assumed the name of
Karukku-mattai Vell&#257;las.</p>
<p>2. Kalla. Said to be the original servants of the Karukku-pattayar,
doing menial work in their houses, and serving as
palanquin-bearers.</p>
<p>3. Natt&#257;ti. Settled at the village of Natt&#257;ti near
Sawyerp&#363;ram. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378"
name="pb378">378</a>]</span></p>
<p>4. Kodikk&#257;l. Derived from kodi, a flag. Standard-bearers of the
fighting men. According to another version, the word means a betel
garden, in reference to those who were betel cultivators.</p>
<p>5. M&#275;l-n&#257;tar (m&#275;l, west). Those who live in the
western part of Tinnevelly and in Travancore.</p>
<p>At the census, 1891, Konga (territorial) and Madurai were returned
as sub-divisions. The latter apparently receives its name, not from the
town of Madura, but from a word meaning sweet juice. At the census,
1901, Tollakk&#257;dan (man with a big hole in his ears) was taken as
being a sub-caste of Sh&#257;n&#257;n, as the people who returned it,
and sell husked rice in Madras, used the title N&#257;d&#257;n. Madura
and Tinnevelly are eminently the homes of dilated ear-lobes. Some Tamil
traders in these two districts, who returned themselves as
P&#257;ndyan, were classified as Sh&#257;n&#257;ns, as N&#257;d&#257;n
was entered as their title. In Coimbatore, some Sh&#257;n&#257;ns,
engaged as shop-keepers, have been known to adopt the name of Chetti.
In Coimbatore, too, the title M&#363;ppan occurs. This title, meaning
headman or elder, is also used by the Ambalak&#257;ran, Valayan,
Sudarm&#257;n, S&#275;naikkudaiy&#257;n, and other castes. In the
Tanjore Manual, the Sh&#257;n&#257;ns are divided into Tennam, Panam,
and Ichcham, according as they tap the cocoanut, palmyra, or wild date
(<i>Ph&oelig;nix sylvestris</i>). The name En&#257;di for
Sh&#257;n&#257;ns is derived from En&#257;di Nayanar, a Saivite saint.
But it also means a barber.</p>
<p>The community has, among its members, land-owners, and graduates in
theology, law, medicine, and the arts. Nine-tenths of the Native clergy
in Tinnevelly are said to be converted Sh&#257;n&#257;ns, and
Tinnevelly claims Native missionaries working in Madagascar, Natal,
Mauritius, and the Straits. The occupations <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name="pb379">379</a>]</span>of
those whom I saw at Nazareth were merchant, cultivator, teacher,
village munsif, organist, cart-driver, and cooly.</p>
<p>The Sh&#257;n&#257;ns have established a school, called Kshatriya
Vidyasala, at Virudupati in Tinnevelly. This is a free school, for
attendance at which no fee is levied on the pupils, for the benefit of
the Sh&#257;n&#257;n community, but boys of other castes are freely
admitted to it. It is maintained by Sh&#257;n&#257;ns from their
mahimai fund, and the teachers are Br&#257;hmans, Sh&#257;n&#257;ns,
etc. The word mahimai means greatness, glory, or respectability.</p>
<p><b>Sh&#257;nb&#333;g.&mdash;</b>The M&#257;gane Sh&#257;nb&#333;g
takes the place, in South Canara, of the village Karnam or accountant.
There are also temple Sh&#257;nb&#333;gs, who are employed at the more
important temples. When social disputes come up for decision at caste
council meetings, the Sh&#257;nb&#333;g appointed by the caste records
the evidence, and the Moktessor or Mukhtesar (chief man) of the caste
decides upon the facts. In some places in South Canara
Sh&#257;nb&#333;g is used as a synonym for S&#257;rasvat Br&#257;hman.
In Mysore, the Sh&#257;nb&#333;g is said<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5348src" href="#xd21e5348" name="xd21e5348src">48</a> to be
&ldquo;the village accountant, with hardly an exception of the
Br&#257;hman caste. The office is hereditary. In some places they hold
land free of rent, and in others on light assessment. In some few
places a fixed money allowance is given. In all instances there are
certain fixed fees payable to them in money or kind by the
ryots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. W. Robinson, in a report on the Laccadive islands
(1869), that &ldquo;the Monegar has the assistance of one of the
islanders as a Karany, to take down depositions, and to read them, for
the character used is the Arabic. In addition to these duties, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name=
"pb380">380</a>]</span>Karany has those of the Shanbogue. He keeps the
accounts of the trees, and the coir (cocoanut fibre) in the islands,
and makes out and delivers the accounts of coir brought to the
coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Shik&#257;ri.&mdash;</b>Shik&#257;ri, meaning a sportsman or
hunter, occurs as a synonym of Irula, and a sub-division of Korava. The
name shik&#257;ri is also applied to a Native who &ldquo;accompanies
European sportsmen as a guide and aid, and to the European sportsman
himself.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5359src" href="#xd21e5359"

<p><b>Sh&#333;laga.&mdash;</b>In his account of the Sh&#333;lagas or
S&#333;lagas, early in the last century, Buchanan<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5366src" href="#xd21e5366" name="xd21e5366src">50</a> writes that
they &ldquo;speak a bad or old dialect of the Karn&#257;ta language,
have scarcely any clothing, and sleep round a fire, lying on a few
plantain leaves, and covering themselves with others. They live chiefly
on the summits of mountains, where the tigers do not frequent, but
where their naked bodies are exposed to a disagreeable cold. Their huts
are most wretched, and consist of bamboos with both ends stuck into the
ground, so as to form an arch, which is covered with plantain
leaves.&rdquo; The up-to-date Sh&#333;laga, who inhabits the jungles of
Coimbatore between Dimbhum and Kollegal near the Mysore frontier, is
clad in a cotton loin-cloth, supplemented by a coat of English pattern
with regimental buttons, and smears himself freely on special
occasions, such as a visit to the Government anthropologist, with
sacred ashes in mimicry of the Ling&#257;yats.</p>
<p>I gather from a correspondent that the following tradition
concerning their origin is current. In days of yore there lived two
brothers in the Geddesala hills, by name K&#257;rayan and Billaya or
M&#257;dh&#275;swara. The Uralis and Sh&#333;lagas are descended from
K&#257;rayan, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href=
"#pb381" name="pb381">381</a>]</span>Sivach&#257;ris (Ling&#257;yats)
from M&#257;dh&#275;swara. The two brothers fell into the hands of a
terrible R&#257;kshasha (demon), by name Savanan, who made K&#257;rayan
a shepherd, but imprisoned M&#257;dh&#275;swara for not paying him
sufficient respect, and extracted all kinds of menial work from him.
Last of all he ordered him to make a pair of shoes, whereupon
M&#257;dh&#275;swara asked for his liberty for a few days, to enable
him to have the shoes well made. His request being granted,
M&#257;dh&#275;swara betook himself to the god Krishnamurti, and asked
him for his help in his troubles. The god was only too happy to assist,
and suggested that the shoes should be made of wax. Helped by
Krishnamurti, M&#257;dh&#275;swara made a very beautiful-looking pair
of shoes. Krishnamurti then ordered him to pile up and light a huge
bonfire on a bare rocky hill east of Geddesala, so as to make it nearly
red-hot. The ashes were then cleared away, so as to leave no trace of
their plot. M&#257;dh&#275;swara then took the shoes, and presented
them to Savanan, who was much pleased with them, and willingly acceded
to M&#257;dh&#275;swara&rsquo;s request that he would put them on, and
walk along the rock. But, as soon as he stepped upon it, the shoes
melted, and Savanan fell heavily on the rock, clutching hold of
M&#257;dh&#275;swara as he fell, and trying to strangle him.
Krishnamurti had assembled all the gods to witness the carrying out of
the plot, and, telling each of them to pile a stone on <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e5374" title=
"Source: Savana&rsquo;s">Savanan&rsquo;s</span> head, himself rescued
M&#257;dh&#275;swara from his clutches, and all jumped upon the
R&#257;kshasha till no trace of him was left. While this was going on,
K&#257;rayan was tending Savanan&rsquo;s herds in the forest, and, when
he came to hear about it, was angry with his brother for not consulting
him before destroying Savanan. Flying from K&#257;rayan, who was armed
with a knife, M&#257;dh&#275;swara implored Krishnamurti&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>help, by which he was able to leap from
Kotriboli to the hill called Urugamalai, a distance of some ten miles.
The force of the leap caused the hill to bend&mdash;hence its name
meaning the bending hill. Finding that the hill was bending, and being
still hotly pursued by his brother, knife in hand, M&#257;dh&#275;swara
again appealed to Krishnamurti, and was enabled to make another leap of
about five miles to a hill called Eggaraimalai, which immediately began
to subside. Hence its name, meaning the subsiding hill. Thence he fled
to Munikanal, and concealed himself under a rock, closely followed by
K&#257;rayan, who slashed the rock with his knife, and left marks which
are visible to this day. From Munikanal he fled to the hill now known
as M&#257;dh&#275;swaranamalai, and hid in a rat hole. K&#257;rayan,
not being able to unearth him, sent for a lot of shepherds, and made
them pen their sheep and cattle over the hole. The effluvium became too
strong for the fugitive, so he surrendered himself to his brother, who
pardoned him on the understanding that, on deification, K&#257;rayan
should have prior claim to all votive offerings. To this
M&#257;dh&#275;swara agreed, and to this day Sivach&#257;ris, when
doing p&#363;ja, first make their offerings to K&#257;rayan and
afterwards to M&#257;dh&#275;swara. In connection with this legend, any
one proceeding to the top of Kotriboli hill at the present day is
expected to place a stone upon the rock, with the result that there are
many piles of stones there. Even Europeans are asked to do this.</p>
<p>The Sh&#333;lagas are said to call themselves men of five kulams, or
exogamous septs, among which are Chalikiri, T&#275;neru, Belleri, Surya
(the sun), and Aleru. By members of the twelve kulam class, everything
is done by twelves. For example, on the twelfth day after a birth,
twelve elders are invited to the house to bless the child. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>At a
marriage, twelve of the bridegroom&rsquo;s relations go and fetch the
bride, and the wedding pandal (booth) has twelve posts. The parents of
the bridegroom pay twelve rupees to the bride&rsquo;s father, and a
t&#257;li (marriage badge) worth twelve annas is tied round the
bride&rsquo;s neck. In case of death, the body is borne on a stretcher
made of twelve bamboos, and mourning lasts for twelve days.</p>
<p>Tribal disputes, <i>e.g.</i>, quarrelling and adultery, are decided
by the Yejam&#257;na, assisted by a Pattagara and a few leading men of
the community. Under the orders of the two former is the
Chalav&#257;thi or village servant. The Yejam&#257;na, Pattagara, and
Chalav&#257;thi must belong respectively to the Chalikiri, Teneri, and
Surya septs.</p>
<p>When a girl reaches puberty, she occupies a separate hut for five
days, and then returns home after a bath. The maternal uncle should
present her with a new cloth, betel leaves and areca nuts, and plantain
fruits. In the formal marriage ceremony, the t&#257;li is tied by the
bridegroom inside a booth; the maternal uncle, if he can afford it,
presents a new cloth to the bride, and a feast is held. Sometimes even
this simple rite is dispensed with, and the couple, without any
formality, live together as man and wife, on the understanding that, at
some time, a feast must be given to a few of the community. I am told
that the Sh&#333;lagas of the Burghur hills have a very extraordinary
way of treating expectant mothers. A few days before the event is
expected to take place, the husband takes his wife right away into the
jungle, and leaves her there alone with three days&rsquo; supply of
food. There she has to stay, and do the best she can for herself. If
she does not come back at the end of the three days, the husband goes
out and takes her more food. But she may not return to her village till
the baby is born. When one of these unfortunate creatures comes back
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name=
"pb384">384</a>]</span>safely, there is a great celebration in her
honour, with beating of tom-tom, etc.</p>
<p>The dead are buried with the body lying on its left side, and the
head to the south. On their return home from a funeral, those who have
been present thereat salute a lighted lamp. On the spot where the dead
person breathed his last, a little r&#257;gi (<i>Eleusine Coracana</i>)
paste and water are placed, and here, on the fourth day, a goat is
sacrificed, and offered up to the soul of the departed. After this the
son proceeds to the burial ground, carrying a stone, and followed by
men selected from each of the exogamous septs. Arrived near the grave,
they sit down, while the son places the stone on the ground, and they
then lift it in succession. The last man to do so is said to fall into
a trance. On his recovery, leaves (plantain, teak, etc.) corresponding
in number to the exogamous septs, are arranged round the stone, and, on
each leaf, different kinds of food are placed. The men partake of the
food, each from the leaf allotted to his sept. The meal concluded, the
son holds the stone in his hands, while his companions pour r&#257;gi
and water over it, and then carries it away to the gopamane
(burial-ground) of his sept, and sets it up there.</p>
<p>On the occasion of a death in a Mala Vell&#257;la village, the
Sh&#333;lagas come in crowds, with clarionets and drums, and bells on
their legs, and dance in front of the house. And the corpse is borne,
in musical procession, to the burning-ground.</p>
<p>The staple food of the Sh&#333;lagas is r&#257;gi paste and yams
(<i>Dioscorea</i>), which, like the Ur&#257;lis, they supplement by
sundry jungle animals and birds. Paroquets they will not eat, as they
regard them as their children.</p>
<p>Their main occupation is to collect minor forest produce,
myrabolams, vembadam bark (<i>Ventilago <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb385" href="#pb385" name="pb385">385</a>]</span>madraspatana</i>),
avaram bark (<i>Cassia auriculata</i>), deers&rsquo; horns, tamarinds,
gum, honey, soap-nuts, sheekoy (<i>Acacia Concinna</i>),etc. The
forests have been divided into blocks, and a certain place within each
block has been selected for the forest dep&ocirc;t. To this place the
collecting agents, mostly Sh&#333;lagas and Ur&#257;lis, bring the
produce, and there it is sorted and paid for by special supervisors
appointed for the work.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Sh&#333;laga.</p>
</div>
<p>In the Coimbatore district the Sh&#333;lagas are said to collect
honey from rocky crevices. The combs are much larger than those found
on trees, and are supposed to contain twice as much wax in proportion
to the honey. On the Nilgiri hills honey-combs are collected by
J&#275;n Kurumbas and Sh&#333;lagas. The supply of honey varies
according to the nature of the season, and is especially plentiful and
of good quality when <i>Strobilanthes Wightianus</i>, <i>S.
Kunthiana</i>, and other species are in flower.</p>
<p>It has been said that even wild beasts will scent a Sh&#333;laga,
and flee before the aroma.</p>
<p>The Sh&#333;lagas, who were examined by Dr. Rivers and myself, came
to the conclusion that the object of our enquiry was to settle them in
a certain place near London, and that the wools of different colours
(used for testing colour vision) given to them for selection, were for
tying them captive with. Others said that they could not understand why
the different organs of their bodies were measured; perhaps to reduce
or increase the size of their body to suit the different works, which
they were expected to do near London. It has been pointed out to me, as
an interesting fact, that a similarity of idea concerning the
modification of different organs to suit men for the doing of special
work has been arrived at by the jungle folk, and by Mr. Wells in his
book, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name=

the lunar inhabitants are described as carrying on the practice.</p>
<p>Of the experiences of a Sh&#333;laga when out with a European on a
shooting expedition, the following account has recently been
given.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5439src" href="#xd21e5439" name=
"xd21e5439src">51</a> &ldquo;My husband was after a bear, and tracked
Bruin to his cave. He had torches made, and these he ordered to be
thrust into the cave in the hope of smoking the bear out, but, as
nothing happened, he went into the cave, accompanied by a Sholigar
carrying a torch. As soon as they got used to the light, they saw a
small aperture leading into an inner cave, and the Sholigar was told to
put the torch in there. Hardly was this done, when out rushed a large
bear, knocking over the Sholigar, and extinguishing the torch. My
husband could not get his gun up in time to fire, as the bear rushed
through the cave into the jungle. Just as the Sholigar was picking
himself up, out rushed another bear. This time my husband was ready,
and fired. To the Sholigar&rsquo;s horror, Bruin sank down wounded at
the entrance to the outer cave, thus blocking the exit, and keeping
both tracker and my husband prisoners. The Sholigar began whimpering,
saying he was the father of a large family, and did not wish to leave
the children fatherless. Soon the bear, though very badly wounded,
managed to get to its feet, and crawl away into the jungle, so
liberating the prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the Sh&#333;lagas of the Mysore Province,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5444src" href="#xd21e5444" name=
"xd21e5444src">52</a> I gather that they &ldquo;inhabit the depths of
the forests clothing the foot and slopes of the Biligirirangam hills.
They cultivate with the hoe small patches of jungle clearings. Their
chief god is Biligiri Rangasv&#257;mi, but they also worship
K&#257;raiyya, their tribal tutelary deity. Their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387</a>]</span>principal food is the r&#257;gi, which they
grow, supplemented by wild forest produce. They are partial to the
flesh of deer, antelope, pigs, sheep and goats. A few of them have, in
recent years, come to own lands. Like the J&#275;nu Kurumbas, they are
perfect trackers of wild animals. Three kinds of marriage prevail among
them. The first is affected by the more well-to-do, who perform the
ceremony with much &eacute;clat under a shed with twelve pillars
(bamboo posts), accompanied by music and festivities, which continue
for three days. The second is more common, and seems to be a modified
form of concubinage. The poorer members resort to the third kind, which
consists in the couple eloping to a distant jungle, and returning home
only after the bride has become a mother. They speak a patois, allied
to old Canarese or Hal&#275; Kannada.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p><b>S&#299;lavant.&mdash;</b>In the Madras Census Report, 1901,
S&#299;lavant is recorded as meaning the virtuous, and as being a
sub-sect of Ling&#257;yats. In the Mysore Census Report, S&#299;lavanta
is given as a name for Ling&#257;yat Nayindas. For the following note
on the S&#299;lavantalu or S&#299;l&#275;vantalu of Vizagapatam, I am
indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao.</p>
<p>They are a sect of Ling&#257;yats, who, though they do not admit it,
appear to be an offshoot of Pattu S&#257;l&#275;s, who became converts
to the Ling&#257;yat religion. They are engaged in the manufacture of
fine cloths for males and females. The religious observances which
secured them their name, meaning those who practice or possess
particular religious customs, have been thus described. In the seventh
month of pregnancy, at the time of quickening, a small stone linga is
enclosed in black lac, wrapped in a piece of silk cloth, and tied to
the thread of the linga which is on the woman&rsquo;s neck. The child
is thus invested with the linga while still <i>in utero</i>. When it is
about a year old, and weaned, the linga is taken off the mother&rsquo;s
neck, and replaced by a silver locket. The linga is tied on the neck of
the child. At the beginning of the twelfth year in the case of boys,
and just before the marriage of girls, this linga is taken off, and a
fresh one suspended round the neck by a guru.</p>
<p>The S&#299;lavantalu are divided into exogamous septs, or
intip&#275;rulu. The custom of m&#275;narikam, whereby a man marries
his maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter, is the rule. But, if the maternal
uncle has no daughter, he must find a suitable bride for his nephew.
Girls are married before puberty, and a Jangam, known as
Mah&#275;svara, officiates at weddings.</p>
<p>The dead are buried in a sitting posture, facing north. The linga is
suspended round the neck of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389"
href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span>corpse, and buried with it.
Six small copper plates are made, each containing a syllable of the
invocation &#332;m na ma Si va ya. Two of these are placed on the
thighs of the corpse, one on the head, one on the navel, and two on the
shoulders, and stuck on with guggilam paste. The corpse is then tied up
in a sack. The relatives offer flowers to it, and burn camphor before
it. The grave is dug several feet deep, and a cavity or cell is made on
the southern side of it, and lined with bamboo matting. The corpse is
placed within the cell, and salt thrown into the grave before it is
filled in. A Jangam officiates at the funeral. Monthly and annual death
ceremonies are performed. A sam&#257;thi or monument is erected over
the grave. Such a monument may be either in the form of a square mound
(brindavan) with niches for lights and a hole in the top, in which a
tulsi (<i>Ocimum sanctum</i>) is planted, or in the form of a small
chamber. Relations go occasionally to the grave, whereon they deposit
flowers, and place lights in the niches or chamber.</p>
<p>The S&#299;lavantalu are strict vegetarians and total abstainers.
Their titles are Ayya and Lingam.</p>
<p><b>Silpa</b> (artisan).&mdash;A sub-division of the Kamm&#257;lans,
Panch&#257;las or Kamsalas, whose hereditary occupation is that of
stone-masons. In the Silpa S&#257;stra, the measurements necessary in
sculpture, the duties of a Silpi, etc., are laid down. I am informed
that the carver of a stone idol has to select a male or female stone,
according as the idol is to be a god or goddess, and that the sex of a
stone can be determined by its ring when struck.</p>
<p><b>Sindhu.&mdash;</b>The Sindhuv&#257;llu (drummers) are
M&#257;digas, who go about acting scenes from the R&#257;mayana or
Mah&#257;bh&#257;ratha, and the story of Ankamma. Sindhu also occurs as
a g&#333;tra of Kurni. The beating of the drum called sindhu is, I
gather, sometimes a nuisance, for a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

it, as the practice &ldquo;causes much crime, and creates extra work
for police and magistrates. Village officials believe they have no
authority to suppress it, but there are some who assert that it is
nominally forbidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Singamu-v&#257;ru.&mdash;</b>Singam is described, in the Madras
Census Report, 1901, as a class of beggars, who beg only from
S&#257;l&#275;s. They are, however, described by Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao
as a class of itinerant mendicants attached to the D&#275;v&#257;ngas.
&ldquo;The name,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;is a variant of
Simhamu-v&#257;ru, or lion-men, <i>i.e.</i>, as valourous as a lion.
They are paid a small sum annually by each D&#275;v&#257;nga village
for various services which they render, such as carrying fire before a
D&#275;v&#257;nga corpse to the burial-ground, acting as caste

Report, 1901, as &ldquo;Oriya temple priests and drummers; a sub-caste
of R&#257;vulo.&rdquo; In an account of them as given to me, they are
stated to be Smartas, and temple priests of village deities, who wear
the sacred thread, but do not employ Br&#257;hmans as pur&#333;hits,
and are regarded as somewhat lower in the social scale than the
R&#257;vulos. Some of their females are said to have been unrecognised
prostitutes, but the custom is dying out. The caste title is M&#363;ni.

small t&#257;li (marriage badge), of a sub-division of Kaik&#333;lan
and Maravan.</p>
<p><b>S&#299;tikan.&mdash;</b>Recorded, in the Travancore Census

<p><b>Sivach&#257;ra.&mdash;</b>It is noted, in the Mysore Census
Report, 1901, that the Ling&#257;yats call themselves &ldquo;V&#299;ra
Saivas, Sivabhaktas, or Sivachars. The V&#299;rasaiva religion consists
of numerous castes. It is a religion consisting of representatives from
almost every caste in Hindu society. People of all castes, from the
highest to the lowest, have embraced the religion. There are Sivachar
Br&#257;hmins, Sivachar Kshatriyas, Sivachar Vaisyas, Sivachar
carpenters, Sivachar weavers, Sivachar goldsmiths, Sivachar potters,
Sivachar washermen, and Sivachar barbers, and other low castes who have
all followed the popular religion in large numbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Sivadvija.&mdash;</b>The name, denoting Saivite Br&#257;hman, by

after the annual Mah&#257;sivar&#257;tri festival in honour of Siva.
Holy ashes, sacred to Siva, prepared by Smartas on this day, are
considered to be very pure.</p>
<p><b>Sivarchaka.&mdash;</b>The word means those who do p&#363;ja
(worship) to Siva. Priests at the temple of village deities are
ordinarily known as P&#363;j&#257;ri, P&#363;s&#257;li, &#332;cchan,
etc., but nowadays prefer the title of &#362;marchaka or Sivarchaka.
The name Sivala occurs in the Madras Census Report, 1901. <span class=

<p><b>Siviyar.&mdash;</b>Siviyar means literally a palanquin-bearer,
and is an occupational name applied to those employed in that capacity.
For this reason a sub-division of the Idaiyans is called Siviyar. The
Siviyars of Coimbatore say that they have no connection with either
Idaiyans or Toreyas, but are Besthas who emigrated from Mysore during
the troublous times of the Muhammadan usurpation. The name Siviyar is
stated to have been given to them by the Tamils, as they were
palanquin-bearers to officers on circuit and others in the pre-railway
days. They claim origin, on the authority of a book called
Parvathar&#257;ja Charithum, from Parvathar&#257;ja. Their main
occupations at the present day are tank and river fishing, but some are
petty traders, physicians, peons, etc. Their language is Canarese, and
their title Naickan. They have eighteen marriage divisions or
g&#333;tras, named after persons from whom the various g&#333;tras are
said to have been descended. On occasions of marriage, when betel leaf
is distributed, it must be given to members of the different
g&#333;tras in their order of precedence. In cases of adultery, the
guilty parties are tied to a post, and beaten with tamarind switches.
When a grown-up but unmarried person dies, the corpse is made to go
through a mock marriage with a human figure cut out of a palm leaf.</p>

<p><b>Sonar.&mdash;</b>The Sonars or Sonag&#257;ras of South Canara are
described by Mr. H. A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5641src" href=
"#xd21e5641" name="xd21e5641src">54</a> as a goldsmith caste, who
&ldquo;speak Konkani, which is a dialect of Mar&#257;thi, and are
believed to have come from Goa. The community at each station has one
or two Mukht&#275;sars or headmen, who enquire into, and settle the
caste affairs. Serious offences are reported to the sw&#257;my of Sode,
who has authority to excommunicate, or to inflict heavy fines. They
wear the sacred thread. Marriages within the same g&#333;tra are
strictly prohibited. Most of them are Vaishnavites, but a few follow
Siva. The dead are burned, and the ashes are thrown into a river. They
eat fish, but not flesh. Their title is Setti.&rdquo; They consider it
derogatory to work in metals other than gold and silver.</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1901, the Sunn&#257;ri (or
Sonn&#257;ri) are described as Oriya goldsmiths (<i>see</i> Risley,
Tribes and Castes of Bengal, Sonar). These goldsmiths, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span>in
the Oriya portion of the Madras Presidency, are, I am informed,
Kamsalas from the Telugu country. Unlike the Oriyas, and like other
Telugu classes, they invariably have a house-name, and their mother
tongue is Telugu. They are Saivites, bury their dead, claim to be
descendants of Viswakarma, and call themselves Viswa Br&#257;hmans.
They do not eat meals prepared by Br&#257;hmans, or drink water at the
hands of Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p>In former times, goldsmiths held the post of Nottak&#257;ran
(tester) or village shroff (money-changer). His function was to test
the rupees tendered when the land revenue was being gathered in, and
see that they were not counterfeit. There is a proverb, uncomplimentary
to the goldsmiths, to the effect that a goldsmith cannot make an
ornament even for his wife, without first secreting some of the gold or
silver given him for working upon.</p>
<p>It has been noted<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5656src" href=
"#xd21e5656" name="xd21e5656src">55</a> that &ldquo;in Madras, an
exceedingly poor country, there is one male goldsmith to every 408 of
the total population; in England, a very rich country, there is only
one goldsmith to every 1,200 inhabitants. In Europe, jewellery is
primarily for ornament, and is a luxury. In India it is primarily an
investment, its ornamental purpose being an incident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The South Indian goldsmith at work has been well described as
follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5661src" href="#xd21e5661" name=
"xd21e5661src">56</a> &ldquo;A hollow, scooped out in the middle of the
mud floor (of a room or verandah), does duty for the fireplace, while,
close by, there is raised a miniature embankment, semi-circular in
shape, with a hole in the middle of the base for the insertion of the
bellows. Crucibles of clay or cow-dung, baked hard in the sun, tongs
and hammers, potsherds of charcoal, dirty <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb395" href="#pb395" name="pb395">395</a>]</span>tins of water, and
little packets of sal-ammoniac, resin, or other similar substances, all
lie scattered about the floor in picturesque confusion. Sitting, or
rather crouching on their haunches, are a couple of the
P&#257;nch&#257;la workmen. One of them is blowing a pan of charcoal
into flame through an iron tube some eighteen inches long by one in
diameter, and stirring up the loose charcoal. Another is hammering at a
piece of silver wire on a little anvil before him. With his miserable
tools the Hindu goldsmith turns out work that well might, and often
deservedly does, rank with the greatest triumphs of the
jeweller&rsquo;s art.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Sondi.&mdash;</b>The Sondis or Sundis are summed up in the Madras
Census Report, 1901, as &ldquo;Oriya toddy-selling caste. They do not
draw toddy themselves, but buy it from Siolos, and sell it. They also
distill arrack.&rdquo; The word arrack or arak, it may be noted <i>en
passant</i>, means properly &ldquo;perspiration, and then, first the
exudation of sap drawn from the date-palm; secondly, any strong drink,
distilled spirit, etc.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5673src" href=
"#xd21e5673" name="xd21e5673src">57</a> A corruption of the word is
rack, which occurs, <i>e.g.</i>, in rack punch.</p>
<p>According to a Sanskrit work, entitled Par&#257;sarapaddati,
Soundikas (toddy-drawers and distillers of arrack) are the offspring of
a Kaivarata male and a Gaudike female. Both these castes are pratiloma
(mixed) castes. In the Matsya Pur&#257;na, the Soundikas are said to
have been born to Siva of seven Apsara women on the bank of the river
Son. Manu refers to the Soundikas, and says that a
Sn&#257;taka<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5681src" href="#xd21e5681"
name="xd21e5681src">58</a> may not accept food from trainers of hunting
dogs, Soundikas, a washerman, a dyer, pitiless man, and a man in whose
house lives a paramour of his wife. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>In a note on the allied Sunris or Sundis of Bengal, Mr. Risley
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5687src" href="#xd21e5687" name=
"xd21e5687src">59</a> that &ldquo;according to Hindu ideas, distillers
and sellers of strong drink rank among the most degraded castes, and a
curious story in the Vaivarta Pur&#257;na keeps alive the memory of
their degradation. It is said that when Sani, the Hindu Saturn, failed
to adapt an elephant&rsquo;s head to the mutilated trunk of
Gan&#275;sa, who had been <span class="corr" id="xd21e5690" title=
"Source: accidently">accidentally</span> beheaded by Siva, Viswakarma,
the celestial artificer, was sent for, and by careful dissection and
manipulation he fitted the incongruous parts together, and made a man
called Ked&#257;ra Sena from the slices cut off in fashioning his work.
This Ked&#257;ra Sena was ordered to fetch a drink of water for
Bhagavati, weary and athirst. Finding on the river&rsquo;s bank a shell
full of water, he presented it to her, without noticing that a few
grains of rice left in it by a parrot had fermented and formed an
intoxicating liquid. Bhagavati, as soon as she had drunk, became aware
of the fact, and in her anger condemned the offender to the vile and
servile occupation of making spirituous liquor for mankind. Another
story traces their origin to a certain Bh&#257;skar or Bh&#257;skar
Muni, who was created by Krishna&rsquo;s brother, Balar&#257;m, to
minister to his desire for strong drink. A different version of the
same legend gives them for ancestor Niranjan, a boy found by
Bh&#257;skar floating down a river in a pot full of country liquor, and
brought up by him as a distiller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following note on the Sondis of Vizagapatam, I am indebted
to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. According to a current tradition, there was,
in days of old, a Br&#257;hman, who was celebrated for his magical
powers. The king, his patron, asked him if he could make the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>water in a tank (pond) burn, and he replied in
the affirmative. He was, however, in reality disconsolate, because he
did not know how to do it. By chance he met a distiller, who asked him
why he looked so troubled, and, on learning his difficulty, promised to
help him on condition that he gave him his daughter in marriage. To
this the Br&#257;hman consented. The distiller gave him a quantity of
liquor to pour into the tank, and told him to set it alight in the
presence of the king. The Br&#257;hman kept his word, and the Sondis
are the descendants of the offspring of his daughter and the distiller.
The caste is divided into several endogamous divisions, viz., Bodo
Odiya, Madhya k&#363;la, and Sanno k&#363;la. The last is said to be
made up of illegitimate descendants of the two first divisions.</p>
<p>The Sondis distil liquor from the ippa (<i>Bassia</i>) flower, rice,
and jaggery (crude sugar). There is a tradition that Brahma created the
world, and pinched up from a point between his eyebrows a little mud,
from which he made a figure, and endowed it with life. Thus Suka Muni
was created, and authorised to distil spirit from the ippa flowers,
which had hitherto been eaten by birds.</p>
<p>When a girl reaches puberty, she is set apart in a room within a
square enclosure made with four arrows connected together by a thread.
Turmeric and oil are rubbed over her daily, and, on the seventh day,
she visits the local shrine.</p>
<p>Girls are married before puberty. Some days before a wedding, a
s&#257;l (<i>Shorea robusta</i>) or <i>neredu (Eugenia Jambolana)</i>
post is set up in front of the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, and a pandal
(booth) erected round it. On the appointed day, a caste feast is held,
and a procession of males proceeds to the bride&rsquo;s house, carrying
with them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398" name=
"pb398">398</a>]</span>finger rings, silver and glass bangles, and
fifty rupees as the jholla tonka (bride price). On the following day,
the bride goes to the house of the bridegroom. On the marriage day, the
contracting couple go seven times round the central post of the pandal,
and their hands are joined by the presiding Oriya Br&#257;hman. They
then sit down, and the sacred fire is raised. The females belonging to
the bridegroom&rsquo;s party sprinkle them with turmeric and rice. On
the following day, a Bhond&#257;ri (barber) cleans the pandal, and
draws patterns in it with rice flour. A mat is spread, and the couple
play with cowry shells. These are five in number, and the bridegroom
holds them tightly in his right hand, while the bride tries to wrest
them from him. If she succeeds in so doing, her brothers beat the
bridegroom, and make fun of him; if she fails, the bridegroom&rsquo;s
sisters beat and make fun of her. The bride then takes hold of the
cowries, and the same performance is gone through. A basket of rice is
brought, and some of it poured into a vessel. The bridegroom holds a
portion of it in his hand, and the bride asks him to put it back. This,
after a little coaxing, he consents to do. These ceremonies are
repeated during the next five days. On the seventh day, small
quantities of food are placed on twelve leaves, and twelve
Br&#257;hmans, who receive a present of money, sit down, and partake
thereof. The marriage of widows is permitted, and a younger brother may
marry the widow of an elder brother.</p>
<p>The dead are burned, and death pollution lasts for ten days. Daily,
during this period, cooked food is strewed on the way leading to the
burning-ground. On the eleventh day, those under pollution bathe, and
the sacred fire (h&#333;mam) is raised by a Br&#257;hman. As at a
wedding, twelve Br&#257;hmans receive food and money. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399</a>]</span>Towards midnight, a new pot is brought, and
holes are bored in it. A lighted lamp and food are placed in it, and it
is taken towards the burning-ground and set down on the ground. The
dead man&rsquo;s name is then called out three times. He is informed
that food is ready, and asked to come.</p>
<p>Men, but not women, eat animal food. The women will not partake of
the remnants of their husbands&rsquo; meal on days on which they eat
meat, because, according to the legend, their female ancestor was a
Br&#257;hman woman.</p>
<p>Among the Sondis of Ganjam, if a girl does not secure a husband
before she reaches maturity, she goes through a form of marriage with
an old man of the caste, or with her elder sister&rsquo;s husband, and
may not marry until the man with whom she has performed this ceremony
dies. On the wedding day, the bridegroom is shaved, and his old
waist-thread is replaced by a new one. The ceremonies commence with the
worship of Gan&#275;sa, and agree in the main with those of many other
Oriya castes. The remarriage of widows is permitted. If a widow was the
wife of the first-born or eldest son in a family, she may not, after
his death, marry one of his younger brothers. She may, however, do so
if she was married in the first instance to a second son.</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. C. F. MacCartie, in the Madras Census Report,
1881, that &ldquo;a good deal of land has been sold by Khond
proprietors to other castes. It was in this way that much territory was
found some years ago to be passing into the hands of the Sundis or
professional liquor distillers. As soon as these facts were brought to
the notice of Government, no time was lost in the adoption of
repressive measures, which have been completely successful, as the
recent census shows a great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href=
"#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span>reduction in the numbers of these
Sundis, who, now that their unscrupulous trade is abolished, have
emigrated largely to Boad and other tracts. This is the only case to my
knowledge in which a special trade has decayed, and with the best
results, as, had it not been so, there is no doubt that the Khond
population would very soon have degenerated into pure <i>adscripti
gleb&aelig;</i>, and the Sundis become the landlords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district, that
&ldquo;besides ippa (liquor distilled from the blossom of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Bassia latifolia</i>), the hill people brew beer from rice,
s&#257;mai (the millet <i lang="la-x-bio">Panicum miliare</i>), and
r&#257;gi (<i lang="la-x-bio">Eleusine Coracana</i>). They mash the
grain in the ordinary manner, add some more water to it, mix a small
quantity of ferment with it, leave it to ferment three or four days,
and then strain off the grain. The beer so obtained is often highly
intoxicating, and different kinds of it go by different names, such as
londa, pandiyam, and maddikallu. The ferment which is used is called
the s&#257;raiya-mandu (spirit drug) or Sondi-mandu (Sondi&rsquo;s
drug), and can be bought in the weekly market. There are numerous
recipes for making it, but the ingredients are always jungle roots and
barks.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5741src" href="#xd21e5741" name=
"xd21e5741src">60</a> It is sold made up into small balls with rice.
The actual shop-keepers and still-owners in the hills, especially in
the Parvatipur and P&#257;lkonda agencies, are usually immigrants of
the Sondi caste, a wily class who know exactly how to take advantage of
the sin which doth so easily beset the hill man, and to wheedle from
him, in exchange for the strong drink which he cannot do without, his
ready money, his little possessions, his crops, and finally his land
itself. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=

<p><span class="corr" id="xd21e5746" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>The Sondis are gradually getting much of
the best land into their hands, and many of the guileless hill ryots
into their power. Mr. Taylor stated in 1892 that &lsquo;the rate of
interest on loans extorted by these Sondis is 100 per cent. and, if
this is not cleared off in the first year, compound interest at 100 per
cent. is charged on the balance. The result is that, in many instances,
the cultivators are unable to pay in cash or kind, and become the
g&#333;tis or serfs of the sowcars, for whom they have to work in
return for mere batta (subsistence allowance), whilst the latter take
care to manipulate their accounts in such a manner that the debt is
never paid off. A remarkable instance of this tyranny was brought to my
notice a few days since. A ryot some fifty years ago borrowed Rs. 20;
he paid back Rs. 50 at intervals, and worked for the whole of his life,
and died in harness. For the same debt the sowcar (money-lender)
claimed the services of his son, and he too died in bondage, leaving
two small sons aged 13 and 9, whose services were also claimed for an
alleged arrear of Rs. 30 on a debt of Rs. 20 borrowed 50 years back,
for which Rs. 50 in cash had been repaid in addition to the perpetual
labour of a man for a similar period.&rsquo; This custom of g&#333;ti
is firmly established, and, in a recent case, an elder brother claimed
to be able to pledge for his own debts the services of his younger
brother, and even those of the latter&rsquo;s wife. Debts due by
persons of respectability are often collected by the Sondis by an
exasperating method, which has led to at least one case of homicide.
They send Gh&#257;sis, who are one of the lowest of all castes, and
contact with whom is utter defilement entailing severe caste penalties,
to haunt the house of the debtor who will not pay, insult and annoy him
and his family, and threaten to drag him forcibly before the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name=
"pb402">402</a>]</span>Sondi.&rdquo; A friend was, on one occasion, out
after big game in the Jeypore hills, and shot a tiger. He asked his
shik&#257;ri (tracker) what reward he should give him for putting him
on to the beast. The shik&#257;ri replied that he would be quite
satisfied with twenty-five rupees, as he wanted to get his younger
brother out of pledge. Asked what he meant, he replied that, two years
previously, he had purchased as his wife a woman who belonged to a
caste higher than his own for a hundred rupees. He obtained the money
by pledging his younger brother to a sowcar, and had paid it all back
except twenty-five rupees. Meanwhile his brother was the bondsman of
the sowcar, and cultivating his land in return for simple food.</p>
<p>It is further recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam
district, that Dombu (or D&#333;mb) dacoits &ldquo;force their way into
the house of some wealthy person (for choice the local Sondi
liquor-seller and sowcar&mdash;usually the only man worth looting in an
Agency village, and a shark who gets little pity from his neighbours
when forced to disgorge), tie up the men, rape the women, and go off
with everything of value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The titles of the Ganjam Sondis are B&#275;hara, Chowdri,
Podh&#257;no, and S&#257;hu. In the Vizagapatam agency tracts, their
title is said to be Biss&#333;yi.</p>
<p><b>Sonkari.&mdash;</b>The Sonkaris are a small class of Oriya lac
bangle (sonka) makers in Ganjam and Vizagapatam, who should not be
confused with the Telugu Sunkaris. The men are engaged in agriculture,
and the women manufacture the bangles, chains, ch&#257;maras
(fly-flappers), kol&#257;tam sticks (for stick play), and fans
ornamented with devices in paddy (unhusked rice) grains, which are
mainly sold to Europeans as curios. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

frequently disregarded. Br&#257;hmans officiate at their marriages. The

1891 to 1,469, they have apparently returned themselves as
Br&#257;hmans in considerable numbers.&rdquo; The St&#257;nikas are, in
the South Canara Manual, said to be &ldquo;the descendants of
Br&#257;hmins by Br&#257;hmin widows and outcast Br&#257;hmin women,
corresponding with Manu&rsquo;s Golaka. They however now claim to be
Siva Br&#257;hmins, forcibly dispossessed of authority by the
M&#257;dhvas, and state that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href=
"#pb404" name="pb404">404</a>]</span>the name St&#257;nika is not that
of a separate caste, but indicates their profession as managers of
temples, with the title of D&#275;va St&#257;nika. This claim is not
generally conceded, and as a matter of fact the duties in which
St&#257;nikas are employed are clearly those of temple servants,
namely, collecting flowers, sweeping the interiors of temples, looking
after the lamps, cleaning the temple vessels, ringing bells, and the
like. Many of them, however, are landowners and farmers. They are
generally Sivites, and wear the sacred thread. Their special deities
are Venkatr&#257;mana and Ganapati. Dr&#257;vida Br&#257;hmins
officiate as their priests, but of late some educated men of the caste
have assumed the priestly office. The caste has two sub-divisions,
viz., Subramania and Kumbla. Girls must be married in infancy,
<i>i.e.</i>, before they attain puberty. Widow remarriage is neither
permitted nor practiced. Their other customs are almost the same as
those of the K&#333;ta Br&#257;hmans. They neither eat flesh nor drink
liquor.&rdquo; It is stated in the Manual that the St&#257;nikas are
called Sh&#257;nb&#333;gs and Mukhtesars. But I am informed that at an
inquest or a search the Moktessors or Mukhtesars (chief men) of a
village are assembled, and sign the inquest report or search list. The
Moktessors of any caste can be summoned together. Some of the
Moktessors of a temple may be St&#257;nikas. In the case of social
disputes decided at caste meetings, the Sh&#257;nb&#333;g (writer or
accountant) appointed by the caste would record the evidence, and the
Moktessor would decide upon the facts.</p>
<p>Of the two sections Subramanya and Kumbla, the former claim
superiority, and there is no intermarriage between them. The members of
the Subramanya section state that they belong to Rig S&#257;ka (Rig
V&#275;da) and have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405"

and B&#257;radwaja, and twelve exogamous septs. Of these septs, the
following are examples:&mdash;</p>

<p>The famous temple of Subramanya is said to have been in charge of
the Subramanya St&#257;nikas, till it was wrested from them by the
Shivalli Br&#257;hmans. In former times, the privilege of sticking a
golden ladle into a heap of food piled up in the temple, on the Shasti
day or sixth day after the new moon in December, is said to have
belonged to the St&#257;nikas. They also brought earth from an ant-hill
on the previous day. Food from the heap and earth are received as
sacred articles by devotees who visit the sacred shrine. A large number
of St&#257;nikas are still attached to temples, where they perform the
duties of cleaning the vessels, washing rice, placing cooked food on
the bali pitam (altar stone), etc. The food placed on the stone is
eaten by St&#257;nikas, but not by Br&#257;hmans. In the Mysore
province, a Br&#257;hman woman who partakes of this food loses her
caste, and becomes a prostitute.</p>
<p>At times of census, Sivadvija and Siva Br&#257;hman have been given
as synonyms of St&#257;nika.</p>
<p><b>Sth&#257;vara.&mdash;</b>Recorded, at times of census, as a
sub-division of Jangam. The lingam, which Ling&#257;yats carry on some

<p><b>Suddho.&mdash;</b>Two distinct castes go by this name, viz., the
Savaras who have settled in the plains, and a small class of
agriculturists and paiks (servants) in the low country of Ganjam. The
Suddhos who live in the hills eat fowls and drink liquor, which those
in the plains abstain from. The caste name Suddho means pure, and is
said to have its origin in the fact that Suddho paiks used to tie the
turbans of the kings of Gums&#363;r. Like other Oriya castes, the
Suddhos have Podh&#257;no, Biss&#333;yi, B&#275;hara, etc., as titles.

themselves, and the office of agent is hereditary. They have particular
tracts of country assigned to them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>The Syrian Christians have &ldquo;sometimes been called the
Christians of the Serra (a Portuguese word, meaning mountains). This
arose from the fact of their living at the foot of the
ghauts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5999src" href="#xd21e5999"
name="xd21e5999src">67</a> The glory of the introduction of the
teachings of Christ to India is, by time-honoured tradition, ascribed
to the apostle Saint Thomas. According to this tradition so dearly
cherished by the Christians of this coast, about 52 A.D. the apostle
landed at Malankara, or, more correctly, at Maliankara near
Crangan&#363;r (Kodungall&#363;r), the Mouziris of the Greeks, or
Muyirikode of the Jewish copper plates. Mouziris was a port near the
mouth of a branch of the Alwaye river, much frequented in their early
voyages by the Ph&oelig;nician and European traders for the pepper and
spices of this coast, and for the purpose of taking in fresh water and
provisions. The story goes that Saint Thomas founded seven churches in
different stations in Cochin and Travancore, and converted, among
others, many Br&#257;hmans, notably the Cally, Calliankara,
Sankarapuri, and Pakalomattam Namb&#363;dri families, the members of
the last claiming the rare distinction of having been ordained as
priests by the apostle himself. He then extended his labours to the
Coromandel coast, where, after making many converts, he is said to have
been pierced with a lance by some Br&#257;hmans, and to have been
buried in the church of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href=
"#pb410" name="pb410">410</a>]</span>St. Thom&eacute;, in Mylapore, a
suburb of the town of Madras. Writing concerning the prevalence of
elephantiasis in Malabar, Captain Hamilton records<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6004src" href="#xd21e6004" name="xd21e6004src">68</a> that
&ldquo;the old Romish Legendaries impute the cause of those great
swell&rsquo;d legs to a curse Saint Thomas laid upon his murderers and
their posterity, and that was the odious mark they should be
distinguished by.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pretty early tradition associates
Thomas with Parthia,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6007src" href=
"#xd21e6007" name="xd21e6007src">69</a> Philip with Phrygia, Andrew
with Syria, and Bartholomew with India, but later traditions make the
apostles divide the various countries between them by
lot.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6012src" href="#xd21e6012" name=
"xd21e6012src">70</a> Even if the former supposition be accepted, there
is nothing very improbable in Saint Thomas having extended his work
from Parthia to India. Others argue that, even if there be any truth in
the tradition of the arrival of Saint Thomas in India, this comprised
the countries in the north-west of India, or at most the India of
Alexander the Great, and not the southern portion of the peninsula,
where the seeds of Christianity are said to have been first sown,
because the voyage to this part of India, then hardly known, was
fraught with the greatest difficulties and dangers, not to speak of its
tediousness. It may, however, be observed that the close proximity of
Alexandria to Palestine, and its importance at the time as the emporium
of the trade between the East and West, afforded sufficient facilities
for a passage to India. If the Roman line of traffic <i>vi&acirc;</i>
Alexandria and the Red Sea was long and tedious, the route
<i>vi&acirc;</i> the Persian Gulf was comparatively easy.</p>
<p>When we come to the second century, we read of Demetrius of
Alexandria receiving a message from some <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb411" href="#pb411" name="pb411">411</a>]</span>natives of India,
earnestly begging for a teacher to instruct them in the doctrines of
Christianity. Hearing this, Pant&aelig;nus, Principal of the Christian
College of Alexandria, an Athenian stoic, an eminent preacher and
&ldquo;a very great gnosticus, who had penetrated most profoundly into
the spirit of scripture,&rdquo; sailed from Berenice for Malabar
between 180 and 190 A.D. He found his arrival &ldquo;anticipated by
some who were acquainted with the Gospel of Mathew, to whom
Bartholomew, one of the apostles, had preached, and had left them the
same Gospel in Hebrew, which also was preserved until this time.
Returning to Alexandria, he presided over the College of
Catechumens.&rdquo; Early in the third century, St. Hippolytus, Bishop
of Portus, also assigns the conversion of India to the apostle
Bartholomew. To Thomas he ascribes Persia and the countries of Central
Asia, although he mentions Calamina, &ldquo;a city of India,&rdquo; as
the place where Thomas suffered death. The Rev. J. Hough<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6026src" href="#xd21e6026" name=
"xd21e6026src">71</a> observes that &ldquo;it is indeed highly
problematical that Saint Bartholomew was ever in India.&rdquo; It may
be remarked that there are no local traditions associating the event
with his name, and, if Saint Bartholomew laboured at all on this coast,
there is no reason why the earliest converts of Malabar should have
preferred the name of Thomas to that of Bartholomew. Though Mr. Hough
and Sir W. W. Hunter,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6031src" href=
"#xd21e6031" name="xd21e6031src">72</a> among others, discredit the
mission of St. Thomas in the first century, they both accept the story
of the mission of Pant&aelig;nus. Mr. Hough says that &ldquo;it is
probable that these Indians (who appealed to Demetrius) were converts
or children of former converts to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412"
href="#pb412" name="pb412">412</a>]</span>Christianity.&rdquo; If, in
the second century, there could be children of former converts in
India, it is not clear why the introduction of Christianity to India in
the first century, and that by St. Thomas, should be so seriously
questioned and set aside as being a myth, especially in view of the
weight of the subjoined testimony, associating the work with the name
of the apostle.</p>
<p>In the Asiatic Journal (Vol. VI), Mr. Whish refutes the assertions
made by Mr. Wrede in the Asiatic Researches (Vol. VII) that the
Christians of Malabar settled in that country &ldquo;during the violent
persecution of the sect of Nestorius under Theodosius II, or some time
after,&rdquo; and says, with reference to the date of the Jewish
colonies in India, that the Christians of the country were settled long
anterior to the period mentioned by Mr. Wrede. Referring to the acts
and journeyings of the apostles, Dorotheus, Bishop of Tyre
(254&ndash;313 A.D.), says &ldquo;the Apostle Thomas, after having
preached the Gospel to the Parthians, Medes, Persians, Germanians,
Bactrians, and Magi, suffered martyrdom at Calamina, a town of
India.&rdquo; It is said that, at the Council of Nice held in 325 A.D.,
India was represented by Johannes, Bishop of India Maxima and Persia.
St. Gregory of Nazianzen (370&ndash;392 A.D.), in answering the
reproach of his being a stranger, asks &ldquo;Were not the apostles
strangers? Granting that Jud&aelig;a was the country of Peter, what had
Paul in common with the Gentiles, Luke with Achaia, Andrew with Epirus,
John with Ephesus, Thomas with India, Mark with Italy&rdquo;? St.
Jerome (390 A.D.) testifies to the general belief in the mission of St.
Thomas to India. He too mentions Calamina as the town where the apostle
met with his death. Baronius thinks that, when Theodoret, the Church
historian (430&ndash;458 A.D.), speaks of the apostles, he evidently
associates the work <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413"
name="pb413">413</a>]</span>in India with the name of St. Thomas. St.
Gregory of Torus relates that &ldquo;in that place in India, where the
body of Thomas lay before it was transferred to Edessa, there is a
monastery and temple of great size.&rdquo; Florentius asserts that
&ldquo;nothing with more certainty I find in the works of the Holy
Fathers than that St. Thomas preached the Gospel in India.&rdquo;
Rufinus, who stayed twenty-five years in Syria, says that the remains
of St. Thomas were brought from India to Edessa. Two Arabian travellers
of the ninth century, referred to by Renaudot, assert that St. Thomas
died at Mailapur.</p>
<p>Coming to modern times, we have several authorities, who testify to
the apostolic origin of the Indian Church, regarded as apocryphal by
Mr. Milne Rae, Sir W. W. Hunter, and others. The historian of the
&lsquo;Indian Empire,&rsquo; while rejecting some of the strongest
arguments advanced by Mr. Milne Rae, accepts his conclusions in regard
to the apostolic origin. The Romanist Portuguese in their enthusiasm
coloured the legends to such an extent as to make them appear
incredible, and the Protestant writers of modern times, while
distrusting the Portuguese version, are not agreed as to the rare
personage that introduced Christianity to India. Mr. Wrede asserts that
the Christians of Malabar settled in that country during the violent
persecution of the sect of Nestorius under Theodosius II, or some time
after. Dr. Burnell traces the origin to the Manich&aelig;an Thomas, who
flourished towards the end of the third century. Mr. Milne Rae brings
the occurrence of the event down to the sixth century of the Christian
era. Sir William Hunter, without associating the foundation of the
Malabar Church with the name of any particular person, states the event
to have taken place some time in the second century, long before the
advent of Thomas the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414"
name="pb414">414</a>]</span>Manich&aelig;an, but considers that the
name St. Thomas Christians was adopted by the Christians in the eighth
century. He observes that &ldquo;the early legend of the
Manich&aelig;an Thomas in the third century and the later labours of
the Armenian Thomas, the rebuilder of the Malabar Church in the eighth
century, endeared that name to the Christians of Southern India.&rdquo;
[It has recently been stated, with reference to the tradition that it
was St. Thomas the apostle who first evangelised Southern India, that,
&ldquo;though this tradition is no more capable of disproof than of
proof, those authorities seem to be on safer ground, who are content to
hold that Christianity was first imported into India by Nestorian or
Chald&aelig;an missionaries from Persia and Mesopotamia, whose
apostolic zeal between the sixth and twelfth centuries ranged all over
Asia, even into Tibet and Tartary. The seat of the Nestorian
Patriarchate of Babylon was at Bagdad, and, as it claimed to be <i>par
excellence</i> the Church of St. Thomas, this might well account for
the fact that the proselytes it won over in India were in the habit of
calling themselves Christians of St. Thomas. It is, to say the least, a
remarkable coincidence that one of the three ancient stone crosses
preserved in India bears an inscription and devices, which are stated
to resemble those on the cross discovered near Singanfu in China,
recording the appearance of Nestorian missionaries in Shenshi in the
early part of the seventh century.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>As already said, there are those who attribute the introduction of
the Gospel to a certain Thomas, a disciple of Manes, who is supposed to
have come to India in 277 A.D., finding in this an explanation of the
origin of the Manigr&#257;makars (inhabitants of the village of Manes)
of Kayenkulam near Quilon. Coming to the middle of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name=
"pb415">415</a>]</span>fourth century, we read of a Thomas Cana, an
Aram&aelig;an or Syrian merchant, or a divine, as some would have it,
who, having in his travels seen the neglected conditions of the flock
of Christ on the Malabar coast, returned to his native land, sought the
assistance of the Catholics of Bagdad, came back with a train of
clergymen and a pretty large number of Syrians, and worked vigorously
to better their spiritual condition. He is said to have married two
Indian ladies, the disputes of succession between whose children
appear, according to some writers, to have given rise to the two names
of Northerners (Vadakkumbagar) and Southerners (Thekkumbagar)&mdash;a
distinction which is still jealously kept up. The authorities are,
however, divided as to the date of his arrival, for, while some assign
345 A.D., others give 745 A.D. It is just possible that this legend but
records the advent of two waves of colonists from Syria at different
times, and their settlement in different stations; and Thomas Cana was
perhaps the leader of the first migration. The Syrian tradition
explains the origin of the names in a different way, for, according to
it, the foreigners or colonists from Syria lived in the southern street
of Crangan&#363;r or Kodungall&#363;r, and the native converts in the
northern street. After their dispersion from Crangan&#363;r, the
Southerners kept up their pride and prestige by refusing to intermarry,
while the name of Northerners came to be applied to all Native
Christians other than the Southerners. At their wedding feasts, the
Southerners sing songs commemorating their colonization at
Kodungall&#363;r, their dispersion from there, and settlement in
different places. They still retain some foreign tribe names, to which
the original colony is said to have belonged. A few of these names are
Baji, Kojah, Kujalik, and Majamuth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb416" href="#pb416" name="pb416">416</a>]</span>Their leader Thomas
Cana is said to have visited the last of the Perum&#257;ls and to have
obtained several privileges for the benefit of the Christians. He is

dated 774 A.D. and 824 A.D. Specialists, who have attempted to fix

"#xd21e6105" name="xd21e6105src">77</a> The Cochin plates did not
create Anjuvannam, but conferred the honours and privileges connected
therewith to a Jew named Rabb&acirc;n. Similarly, the rights and
honours associated with the other corporation, Manigr&acirc;mam, were
bestowed at a later period on Ravikkorran. It is just possible that
Ravikkorran was a Christian by religion. But his name and title give no
clue in this direction, and there is nothing Christian in the document,
except its possession by the present owners. On this name, Dr. Gundert
first said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6110src" href="#xd21e6110" name=
"xd21e6110src">78</a> &lsquo;Iravi Corttan must be a Nasrani name,
though none of the Syrian priests whom I saw could explain it, or had
ever heard of it.&rsquo; Subsequently he added: &lsquo;I had indeed
been startled by the Iravi Corttan, which does not look at all like the
appellation of a Syrian Christian; still I thought myself justified in
calling Manigr&acirc;mam a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href=
"#pb419" name="pb419">419</a>]</span>Christian
principality&mdash;whatever their Christianity may have consisted
in&mdash;on the ground that, from Menezes&rsquo; time, these grants had
been regarded as given to the Syrian colonists.&rsquo; Mr. Kookel Keloo
Nair considered Iravikkorran a mere title, in which no shadow of a
Syrian name is to be traced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nestorius, a native of Germanicia, was educated at Antioch, where,
as Presbyter, he became celebrated, while yet very young, for his
asceticism, orthodoxy, and eloquence. On the death of Sisinnius,
Patriarch of Constantinople, this distinguished preacher of Antioch was
appointed to the vacant See by the Emperor Theodosius II, and was
consecrated as Patriarch in 428 A.D. The doctrine of a God-man
respecting Christ, and the mode of union of the human and the divine
nature in Him left undefined by the early teachers, who contented
themselves with speaking of Him and regarding Him as &ldquo;born and
unborn, God in flesh, life in death, born of Mary, and born of
God,&rdquo; had, long before the time of Nestorius, begun to tax the
genius of churchmen, and the controversies in respect of this double
nature of Christ had led to the growth and spread of important
heretical doctrines. Two of the great heresies of the church before
that of Nestorius are associated with the names of Arius and
Apollinaris. Arius &ldquo;admitted both the divine and the human nature
of Christ, but, by making Him subordinate to God, denied His divinity
in the highest sense.&rdquo; Apollinaris, undermining the doctrine of
the example and atonement of Christ, argued that &ldquo;in Jesus the
<i>Logos</i> supplied the place of the reasonable soul.&rdquo; As early
as 325 A.D. the first &OElig;cumenical Council of Nice had defined
against the Arians, and decreed that &ldquo;the Son was not only of
<i>like</i> essence, but of the <i>same</i> essence with the Father,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name=
"pb420">420</a>]</span>the human nature, maimed and misinterpreted by
the Apollinarians, had been restored to the person of Christ at the
Council of Constantinople in 381.&rdquo; Nestorius, finding the Arians
and Apollinarians, condemned strongly though they were, still strong in
numbers and influence at Constantinople, expressed in his first sermon
as Patriarch his determination to put down these and other heretical
sects, and exhorted the Emperor to help him in this difficult task.
But, while vigorously engaged in the effectual extinction of all
heresies, he incurred the displeasure of the orthodox party by boldly
declaring, though in the most sincerely orthodox form, against the use
of the term Theotokos, that is, Mother of God, which, as applied to the
Virgin Mary, had then grown into popular favour, especially amongst the
clergy at Constantinople and Rome. While he himself revered the Blessed
Virgin as the Mother of Christ, he declaimed against the use of the
expression Mother of God in respect of her, as being alike
&ldquo;unknown to the Apostles, and unauthorised by the Church,&rdquo;
besides its being inherently absurd to suppose that the Godhead can be
born or suffer. Moreover, in his endeavour to avoid the extreme
positions taken up by Arians and Apollinarians, he denied, while
speaking of the two natures in Christ, that there was any communication
of attributes. But he was understood on this point to have maintained a
mechanical rather than a supernatural union of the two natures, and
also to have rent Christ asunder, and divided Him into two persons.
Explaining his position, Nestorius said &ldquo;I distinguish the
natures, but I unite my adoration.&rdquo; But this explanation did not
satisfy the orthodox, who understood him to have &ldquo;preached a
Christ less than divine.&rdquo; The clergy and laity of Constantinople,
amongst whom Nestorius had thus grown <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb421" href="#pb421" name="pb421">421</a>]</span>unpopular, and was
talked of as a heretic, appealed to Cyril, Bishop of the rival See of
Alexandria, to interfere on their behalf. Cyril, supported by the
authority of the Pope, arrived on the scene, and, at the Council of
Ephesus, hastily and informally called up, condemned Nestorius as a
heretic, and excommunicated him. After Nestorianism had been rooted out
of the Roman Empire in the time of Justinian, it flourished &ldquo;in
the East,&rdquo; especially in Persia and the countries adjoining it,
where the churches, since their foundation, had been following the
Syrian ritual, discipline, and doctrine, and where a strong party,
among them the Patriarch of Seleucia or Babylon, and his suffragan the
Metropolitan of Persia, with their large following, revered Nestorius
as a martyr, and faithfully and formally accepted his teachings at the
Synod of Seleucia in 448 A.D. His doctrines seem to have spread as far
east as China, so that, in 551, Nestorian monks who had long resided in
that country are said to have brought the eggs of the silkworm to
Constantinople<span class="corr" id="xd21e6133" title=
"Not in source">.</span> Cosmos, surnamed Indicopleustes, the Indian
traveller, who, in 522 A.D., visited Male, &ldquo;the country where the
pepper grows,&rdquo; has referred to the existence of a fully organised
church in Malabar, with the Bishops consecrated in Persia. His
reference, while it traces the origin of the Indian church to the
earlier centuries, also testifies to the fact that, at the time of his
visit, the church was Nestorian in its creed &ldquo;from the
circumstance of its dependence upon the Primate of Persia, who then
unquestionably held the Nestorian doctrines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next heresy was that of Eutyches, a zealous adherent of Cyril in
opposition to Nestorius at the Council of Ephesus in 431 A.D. But
Eutyches, in opposing the doctrine of Nestorius, went beyond Cyril and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name=
"pb422">422</a>]</span>others, and affirmed that, after the union of
the two natures, the human and the divine, Christ had only one nature
the divine, His humanity being absorbed in His divinity. After several
years of controversy, the question was finally decided at the Council
of Chalcedon in 451, when it was declared, in opposition to the
doctrine of Eutyches, that the two natures were united in Christ, but
&ldquo;without any alteration, absorption, or confusion&rdquo;; or, in
other words, in the person of Christ there were two natures, the human
and the divine, each perfect in itself, but there was only one person.
Eutyches was excommunicated, and died in exile. Those who would not
subscribe to the doctrines declared at Chalcedon were condemned as
heretics; they then seceded, and afterwards gathered themselves around
different centres, which were Syria, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, Cyprus
and Palestine, Armenia, Egypt, and Abyssinia. The Armenians embraced
the Eutychian theory of divinity being the sole nature in Christ, the
humanity being absorbed, while the Egyptians and Abyssinians held in
the monophysite doctrine of the divinity and humanity being one
compound nature in Christ. The West Syrians, or natives of Syria
proper, to whom the Syrians of this coast trace their origin, adopted,
after having renounced the doctrines of Nestorius, the Eutychian tenet.
Through the influence of Severus, Patriarch of Antioch, they gradually
became Monophysites. The Monophysite sect was for a time suppressed by
the Emperors, but in the sixth century there took place the great
Jacobite revival of the monophysite doctrine under James Bard&aelig;us,
better known as Jacobus Zanzalus, who united the various divisions,
into which the Monophysites had separated themselves, into one church,
which at the present day exists under the name of the Jacobite
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name=
"pb423">423</a>]</span>church. The head of the Jacobite church claims
the rank and prerogative of the Patriarch of Antioch&mdash;a title
claimed by no less than three church dignitaries. Leaving it to subtle
theologians to settle the disputes, we may briefly define the position
of the Jacobites in Malabar in respect of the above controversies.
While they accept the qualifying epithets pronounced by the decree
passed at the Council of Chalcedon in regard to the union of the two
natures in Christ, they object to the use of the word <i>two</i> in
referring to the same. So far they are practically at one with the
Armenians, for they also condemn the Eutychian doctrine; and a Jacobite
candidate for holy orders in the Syrian church has, among other things,
to take an oath denouncing Eutyches and his teachers.</p>
<p>We have digressed a little in order to show briefly the position of
the Malabar church in its relation to Eastern Patriarchs in the early,
medi&aelig;val, and modern times. To resume the thread of our story,
from about the middle of the fourth century until the arrival of the
Portuguese, the Christians of Malabar in their spiritual distress
generally applied for Bishops indiscriminately to one of the Eastern
Patriarchs, who were either Nestorian or Jacobite; for, as observed by
Sir W. W. Hunter, &ldquo;for nearly a thousand years from the 5th to
the 15th century, the Jacobite sect dwelt in the middle of the
Nestorians in the Central Asia,&rdquo; so that, in response to the
requests from Malabar, both Nestorian and Jacobite Bishops appear to
have visited Malabar occasionally, and the natives seem to have
indiscriminately followed the teachings of both. We may here observe
that the simple folk of Malabar, imbued but with the primitive form of
Christianity, were neither conversant with nor ever troubled themselves
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424" name=
"pb424">424</a>]</span>about the subtle disputations and doctrinal
differences that divided their co-religionists in Europe and Asia
Minor, and were, therefore, not in a position to distinguish between
Nestorian or any other form of Christianity. Persia also having
subsequently neglected the outlying Indian church, the Christians of
Malabar seem to have sent their applications to the Patriarch of
Babylon, but, as both prelates then followed the Nestorian creed, there
was little or no change in the rituals and dogmas of the church. Dr.
Day<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6149src" href="#xd21e6149" name=
"xd21e6149src">79</a> refers to the arrival of a Jacobite Bishop in
India in 696 A.D. About the year 823 A.D., two Nestorian Bishops, Mar
Sapor and Mar Aprot, appear to have arrived in Malabar under the
command of the Nestorian Patriarch of Babylon. They are said to have
interviewed the native rulers, travelled through the country, built
churches, and looked after the religious affairs of the Syrians.</p>
<p>We know but little of the history of the Malabar Church for nearly
six centuries prior to the arrival of the Portuguese in India. We have,
however, the story of the pilgrimage of the Bishop of Sherborne to the
shrine of St. Thomas in India about 883 A.D., in the reign of Alfred
the Great; and the reference made to the prevalence of Nestorianism
among the St. Thomas&rsquo; Christians of Malabar by Marco Polo, the
Venetian traveller.</p>
<p>The Christian community seem to have been in the zenith of their
glory and prosperity between the 9th and 14th centuries, as, according
to their tradition, they were then permitted to have a king of their
own, with Villiarvattam near Udayamper&#363;r (Diamper) as his capital.
According to another version, the king of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb425" href="#pb425" name="pb425">425</a>]</span>Villiarvattam was a
convert to Christianity. The dynasty seems to have become extinct about
the 14th century, and it is said that, on the arrival of the
Portuguese, the crown and sceptre of the last Christian king were
presented to Vasco da Gama in 1502. We have already referred to the
high position occupied by the Christians under the early kings, as is
seen from the rare privileges granted to them, most probably in return
for military services rendered by them. The king seems to have enjoyed,
among other things, the right of punishing offences committed by the
Christian community, who practically followed his lead. A more
reasonable view of the story of a Christian king appears to be that a
Christian chief of Udayamper&#363;r enjoyed a sort of socio-territorial
jurisdiction over his followers, which, in later times, seems to have
been so magnified as to invest him with territorial sovereignty. We
see, in the copper-plate charters of the Jews, that their chief was
also invested with some such powers.</p>
<p>Mention is made of two Latin Missions in the 14th century, with
Quilon as head-quarters, but their labours were ineffectual, and their
triumphs but short-lived. Towards the end of the 15th, and throughout
the whole of the 16th century, the Nestorian Patriarch of Mesopotamia
seems to have exercised some authority over the Malabar Christians, as
is borne out by the occasional references to the arrival of Nestorian
Bishops to preside over the churches.</p>
<p>Until the arrival of the Portuguese, the Malabar church was
following unmolested, in its ritual, practice and communion, a creed of
the Syro-Chald&aelig;an church of the East. When they set out on their
voyages, conquest and conversion were no less dear to the heart of
Portuguese than enterprise and commerce. Though, in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name=
"pb426">426</a>]</span>first moments, the Syrians, in their neglected
spiritual condition, were gratified at the advent of their
co-religionists, the Romanist Portuguese, and the Portuguese in their
turn expected the most beneficial results from an alliance with their
Christian brethren on this coast, &ldquo;the conformity of the Syrians
to the faith and practice of the 5th century soon disappointed the
prejudices of the Papist apologists. It was the first care of the
Portuguese to intercept all correspondence with the Eastern Patriarchs,
and several of their Bishops expired in the prisons of their Holy
Office.&rdquo; The Franciscan and Dominican Friars, and the Jesuit
Fathers, worked vigorously to win the Malabar Christians over to the
Roman Communion. Towards the beginning of the last quarter of the 16th
century, the Jesuits built a church at Vaippacotta near Crangan&#363;r,
and founded a college for the education of Christian youths. In 1584, a
seminary was established for the purpose of instructing the Syrians in
theology, and teaching them the Latin, Portuguese and Syriac languages.
The dignitaries who presided over the churches, however, refused to
ordain the students trained in the seminary. This, and other causes of
quarrel between the Jesuits and the native clergy, culminated in an
open rupture, which was proclaimed by Archdeacon George in a Synod at
Angam&#257;li. When Alexes de Menezes, Archbishop of Goa, heard of
this, he himself undertook a visitation of the Syrian churches. The
bold and energetic Menezes carried all before him. Nor is his success
to be wondered at. He was invested with the spiritual authority of the
Pope, and armed with the terrors of the Inquisition. He was encouraged
in his efforts by the Portuguese King, whose Governors on this coast
ably backed him up. Though the ruling chiefs at first discountenanced
the exercise of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427"
name="pb427">427</a>]</span>coercive measures over their subjects, they
were soon won over by the stratagems of the subtle Archbishop. Thus
supported, he commenced his visitation of the churches, and reduced
them in A.D. 1599 by the decrees of the Synod of Diamper
(Udayamper&#363;r), a village about ten miles to the south-east of the
town of Cochin. The decrees passed by the Synod were reluctantly
subscribed to by Archdeacon George and a large number of Kathanars, as
the native priests are called; and this practically converted the
Malabar Church into a branch of the Roman Church. Literature sustained
a very great loss at the hands of Menezes, &ldquo;for this blind and
enthusiastic inquisitor destroyed, like a second Omar, all the books
written in the Syrian or Chald&aelig;an language, which could be
collected, not only at the Synod of Diamper, but especially during his
subsequent circuit; for, as soon as he had entered into a Syrian
Church, he ordered all their books and records to be laid before him,
which, a few indifferent ones excepted, he committed to the flames, so
that at present neither books nor manuscripts are any more to be found
amongst the St. Thom&eacute; Christians.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6166src" href="#xd21e6166" name="xd21e6166src">80</a></p>
<p>Immediately after the Synod of Diamper, a Jesuit Father, Franciscus
Roz, a Spaniard by birth, was appointed Bishop of Angam&#257;li by Pope
Clement VIII. The title was soon after changed to that of Archbishop of
Crangan&#363;r. By this time, the rule of the Jesuits had become so
intolerable to the Syrians that they resolved to have a Bishop from the
East, and applied to Babylon, Antioch, Alexandria, and other
ecclesiastical head-quarters for a Bishop, as if the ecclesiastical
heads who presided over these places professed the same creed.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428" name=
"pb428">428</a>]</span>The request of the Malabar Christians for a
Bishop was readily responded to from Antioch, and Ahattala, otherwise
known as Mar Ignatius, was forthwith sent. Authorities, however, differ
on this point, for, according to some, this Ahattala was a Nestorian,
or a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the Patriarch of the Copts. Whatever
Ahattala&rsquo;s religious creed might have been, the Syrians appear to
have believed that he was sent by the Jacobite Patriarch of Antioch.
The Portuguese, however, intercepted him, and took him prisoner. The
story goes that he was drowned in the Cochin harbour, or condemned to
the flames of the Inquisition at Goa in 1653. This cruel deed so
infuriated the Syrians that thousands of them met in solemn conclave at
the Coonen Cross at Matt&#257;ncheri in Cochin, and, with one voice,
renounced their allegiance to the Church of Rome. This incident marks
an important epoch in the history of the Malabar Church, for, with the
defection at the Coonen Cross, the Malabar Christians split themselves
up into two distinct parties, the Romo-Syrians who adhered to the
Church of Rome, and the Jacobite Syrians, who, severing their
connection with it, placed themselves under the spiritual supremacy of
the Patriarch of Antioch. The following passage explains the exact
position of the two parties that came into existence then, as also the
origin of the names since applied to them. &ldquo;The Pazheia
K&#363;ttukar, or old church, owed its foundation to Archbishop Menezes
and the Synod of Diamper in 1599, and its reconciliation, after revolt,
to the Carmelite Bishop, Joseph of St. Mary, in 1656. It retains in its
services the Syrian language, and in part the Syrian ritual. But it
acknowledges the supremacy of the Pope and his Vicars Apostolic. Its
members are now known as Catholics of the Syrian rite, to distinguish
them from the converts made direct from <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb429" href="#pb429" name="pb429">429</a>]</span>heathenism to the
Latin Church by the Roman missionaries. The other section of the Syrian
Christians of Malabar is called the Puttan K&#363;ttukar, or new
church. It adheres to the Jacobite tenets introduced by its first
Jacobite Bishop, Mar Gregory, in 1665.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6175src" href="#xd21e6175" name="xd21e6175src">81</a> We have at
this time, and ever after, to deal with a third party, that came into
existence after the advent of the Portuguese. These are the Catholics
of the Latin rite, and consist almost exclusively of the large number
of converts gained by the Portuguese from amongst the different castes
of the Hindus. To avoid confusion, we shall follow the fortunes of each
sect separately.</p>
<p>When the Portuguese first came to India, the Indian trade was
chiefly in the hands of the Moors, who had no particular liking for the
Hindus or Christians, and the arrival of the Portuguese was therefore
welcome alike to the Hindus and Christians, who eagerly sought their
assistance. The Portuguese likewise accepted their offers of friendship
very gladly, as an alliance, especially with the former, gave them
splendid opportunities for advancing their religious mission, while,
from a friendly intercourse with the latter, they expected not only to
further their religious interests, but also their commercial
prosperity. In the work of conversion they were successful, more
especially among the lower orders, the Illuvans, Mukkuvans, Pulayans,
etc. The labours of Miguel Vaz, afterwards Vicar-General of Goa, and of
Father Vincent, in this direction were continued with admirable success
by St. Francis Xavier.</p>
<p>We have seen how the strict and rigid discipline of the Jesuit
Archbishops, their pride and exclusiveness, and the capture and murder
of Ahattala brought about <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href=
"#pb430" name="pb430">430</a>]</span>the outburst at the Coonen Cross.
Seeing that the Jesuits had failed, Pope Alexander VII had recourse to
the Carmelite Fathers, who were specially instructed to do their best
to remove the schism, and to bring about a reconciliation; but, because
the Portuguese claimed absolute possession of the Indian Missions, and
as the Pope had despatched the Carmelite Fathers without the approval
of the King of Portugal, the first batch of these missionaries could
not reach the destined field of their labours. Another body of
Carmelites, who had taken a different route, however, succeeded in
reaching Malabar in 1656, and they met Archdeacon Thomas who had
succeeded Archdeacon George. While expressing their willingness to
submit to Rome, the Syrians declined to place themselves under
Archbishop Garcia, S.J., who had succeeded Archbishop Roz, S.J. The
Syrians insisted on their being given a non-Jesuit Bishop, and, in
1659, Father Joseph was appointed Vicar Apostolic of the &ldquo;Sierra
of Malabar&rdquo; without the knowledge of the King of Portugal. He
came out to India in 1661, and worked vigorously for two years in
reconciling the Syrian Christians to the Church of Rome. But he was not
allowed to continue his work unmolested, because, when the Dutch, who
were competing with the Portuguese for supremacy in the Eastern seas,
took the port of Cochin in 1663, Bishop Joseph was ordered to leave the
coast forthwith. When he left Cochin, he consecrated Chandy Parambil,
otherwise known as Alexander de Campo.</p>
<p>By their learning, and their skill in adapting themselves to
circumstances, the Carmelite Fathers had continued to secure the
good-will of the Dutch, and, returning to Cochin, assisted Alexander de
Campo in his work. Father Mathew, one of their number, was allowed to
build a church at Chatiath near Ernakulam. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431</a>]</span>Another church was built at Varapuzha (Verapoly)
on land given rent-free by the R&#257;ja of Cochin. Since this time,
Varapuzha, now in Travancore, has continued to be the residence of a
Vicar Apostolic.</p>
<p>The history of a quarter of a century subsequent to this is
uneventful, except for the little quarrels between the Carmelite
Fathers and the native clergy. In 1700, however, the Archbishop of Goa
declined to consecrate a Carmelite Father nominated by the Pope to the
Vicariate Apostolic. But Father Anjelus, the Vicar Apostolic elect, got
himself consecrated by one Mar Simon, who was supposed to be in
communion with Rome. The Dutch Government having declined admission to
Archbishop Ribeiro, S.J., the nominee of the Portuguese King to their
dominions, Anjelus was invested with jurisdiction over Cochin and
Crangan&#363;r. Thereupon, the Jesuit Fathers sought shelter in
Travancore, and in the territories of the Zamorin. With the capture of
Crangan&#363;r by the Dutch, which struck the death-blow to Portuguese
supremacy in the East, the last vestige of the church, seminary and
college founded by the Jesuits disappeared. As the Dutch hated the
Jesuits as bigoted Papists and uncompromising schismatics, several of
the Jesuit Fathers, who were appointed Archbishops of Crangan&#363;r,
never set foot within their diocese, and such of them as accepted the
responsibility confined themselves to the territories of the R&#257;ja
of Travancore. It was only after the establishment of British supremacy
that the Jesuit Fathers were able to re-enter the scene of their early
labours. An almost unbroken line of Carmelite Fathers appointed by the
Pope filled the Vicariate till 1875, though the Archbishop of Goa and
the Bishop of Cochin now and then declined to consecrate the nominee,
and thus made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href="#pb432" name=
"pb432">432</a>]</span>feeble attempts on behalf of their Faithful King
to recover their lost position.</p>
<p>Salvador, S.J., Archbishop of Crangan&#363;r, died in 1777. Five
years after this, the King of Portugal appointed Joseph Cariatil and
Thomas Paramakal, two native Christians, who had been educated at the
Propaganda College at Rome, as Archbishop and Vicar-General,
respectively, of the diocese of Crangan&#363;r.</p>
<p>The native clergy at the time were mostly ignorant, and the
discipline amongst them was rather lax. The Propaganda attempted
reforms in this direction, which led to a rupture between the Latin and
the native clergy. The Carmelite Fathers, like the Jesuits, had grown
overbearing and haughty, and an attempt at innovation made by the Pope
through them became altogether distasteful to the natives. Serious
charges against the Carmelites were, therefore, formally laid before
the Pope and the R&#257;ja of Travancore by the Syrians. They also
insisted that Thomas should be consecrated Bishop. At this time, the
Dutch were all-powerful at the courts of native rulers, and, though the
Carmelite missionaries who had ingratiated themselves into the good
graces of the Dutch tried their best to thwart the Syrians in their
endeavours, Thomas was permitted to be consecrated Bishop, and the
Syrians were allowed the enjoyment of certain rare privileges. It is
remarkable that, at this time and even in much earlier times, the
disputes between the foreign and the native clergy, or between the
various factions following the lead of the native clergy, were often
decided by the Hindu kings, and the Christians accepted and abided by
the decisions of their temporal heads.</p>
<p>In 1838, Pope Gregory XVI issued a Bull abolishing the Sees of
Crangan&#363;r and Cochin, and transferring the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433" name=
"pb433">433</a>]</span>jurisdiction to the Vicar Apostolic of
Varapuzha. But the King of Portugal questioned the right of the Pope,
and this led to serious disputes. The abolition of the smaller
seminaries by Archbishop Bernardin of Varapuzha, and his refusal to
ordain candidates for Holy Orders trained in these seminaries by the
Malpans or teacher-priests, caused much discontent among the Syrian
Christians, and, in 1856, a large section of the Syrians applied to the
Catholic Chald&aelig;an Patriarch of Babylon for a Chald&aelig;an
Bishop. This was readily responded to by the Patriarch, who, though
under the Pope, thought that he had a prescriptive right to supremacy
over the Malabar Christians. Bishop Roccos was sent out to Malabar in
1861, and though, owing to the charm of novelty, a large section of the
Christians at once joined him, a strong minority questioned his
authority, and referred the matter to the Pope. Bishop Roccos was
recalled, and the Patriarch was warned by the Pope against further
interference.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Patriarch, again acting on the notion that he had
independent jurisdiction over the Chald&aelig;an Syrian church of
Malabar, sent out Bishop Mellus to Cochin. The arrival of this Bishop
in 1874 created a distinct split among the Christians of Trich&#363;r,
one faction acknowledging the supremacy of the Pope, and the other
following the lead of Bishop Mellus. This open rupture had involved the
two factions in a costly litigation. The adherents of Bishop Mellus
contend that their church, ever since its foundation in 1810 or 1812,
has followed the practice, ritual, and communion of the Chald&aelig;an
church of Babylon, without having ever been in communion with Rome. The
matter is <i>sub judice</i>. They are now known by the name of
Chald&aelig;an Syrians. The Pope, in the meanwhile, excommunicated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name=
"pb434">434</a>]</span>Bishop Mellus, but he continued to exercise
spiritual authority over his adherents independently of Rome. In 1887
the Patriarch having made peace with the Pope, Bishop Mellus left
India, and submitted to Rome in 1889. On the departure of Bishop
Mellus, the Chald&aelig;an Syrians chose Anthony Kathanar, otherwise
known as Mar Abdeso, as their Archbishop. He is said to have been a
Rome Syrian priest under the Archbishop of Varapuzha. It is also said
that he visited Syria and Palestine, and received ordination from the
anti-Roman Patriarch of Babylon. Before his death in 1900, he ordained
Mar Augustine, who, under the title of Chorepiscopus, had assisted him
in the government of the Chald&aelig;an church, and he now presides
over the Chald&aelig;an Syrian churches in the State.</p>
<p>In 1868, Bishop Marcellinus was appointed Coadjutor to the Vicar
Apostolic of Varapuzha, and entrusted with the spiritual concerns of
the Romo-Syrians. On his death in 1892, the Romo-Syrians were placed
under the care of two European Vicars Apostolic. We have seen how the
Jesuits had made themselves odious to the native Christians, and how
reluctantly the latter had submitted to their rigid discipline. We have
seen, too, how the Carmelites who replaced them, in spite of their
worldly wisdom and conciliatory policy, had their own occasional
quarrels and disputes with the native clergy and their congregations.
From the time of the revolt at the Coonen Cross, and ever afterwards,
the Christians had longed for Bishops of their own nationality, and
made repeated requests for the same. For some reason or other,
compliance with these requisitions was deferred for years. Experience
showed that the direct rule of foreign Bishops had failed to secure the
unanimous sympathy and hearty co-operation of the people. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name=
"pb435">435</a>]</span>Pope was, however, convinced of the spiritual
adherence of the native clergy and congregation to Rome. In these
circumstances, it was thought advisable to give the native clergy a
fair trial in the matter of local supremacy. Bishops Medlycott and
Lavigne, S.J., who were the Vicars Apostolic of Trich&#363;r and
Kottayam, were therefore withdrawn, and, in 1896, three native Syrian
priests, Father John Menacheri, Father Aloysius Pareparambil, and
Father Mathew Mackil, were consecrated by the Papal Delegate as the
Vicars Apostolic of Trich&#363;r, Ern&#257;kulam, and
Chenganacheri.</p>
<p>The monopoly of the Indian missions claimed by the Portuguese, and
the frequent disputes which disturbed the peace of the Malabar church,
were ended in 1886 by the Concordat entered into between Pope Leo XIII
and the King of Portugal. The Archbishop of Goa was by this recognised
as the Patriarch of the East Indies with the Bishop of Cochin as a
suffragan, whose diocese in the Cochin State is confined to the
seaboard t&#257;luk of Cochin. The rest of the Latin Catholics of this
State, except a small section in the Chitt&#363;r t&#257;luk under the
Bishop of Coimbatore, are under the Archbishop of Varapuzha.</p>
<p>Since the revolt of the Syrians at the Coonen Cross in 1653, the
Jacobite Syrians have been governed by native Bishops consecrated by
Bishops sent by the Patriarch of Antioch, or at least always received
and recognised as such. In exigent circumstances, the native Bishops
themselves, before their death, consecrated their successors by the
imposition of hands. Immediately after the defection, they chose
Archdeacon Thomas as their spiritual leader. He was thus the first
Metran or native Bishop, having been formally ordained after twelve
years of independent rule by Mar Gregory from Antioch, with whose name
the revival of Jacobitism in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href=
"#pb436" name="pb436">436</a>]</span>Malabar is associated. The Metran
assumed the title of Mar Thomas I. He belonged to the family that
traced its descent from the Pakalomattom family, held in high respect
and great veneration as one of the Br&#257;hman families, the members
of which are supposed to have been converted and ordained as priests by
the apostle himself. Members of the same family continued to hold the
Metranship till about the year 1815, when the family is supposed to
have become extinct. This hereditary succession is supposed by some to
be a relic of the Nestorian practice. It may, however, be explained in
another way. The earliest converts were high-caste Hindus, amongst whom
an Anandravan (brother or nephew) succeeded to the family estates and
titles in pursuance of the joint family system as current in Malabar.
The succession of a brother or a nephew might, therefore, be quite as
much a relic of the Hindu custom. The Metrans possessed properties.
They were, therefore, interested in securing the succession of their
Anandravans, so that their properties might not pass to a different
family. Mar Thomas I was succeeded by his brother Mar Thomas II, on
whose death his nephew became Metran under the title of Mar Thomas III.
He held office only for ten days. Mar Thomas IV, who succeeded him,
presided over the church till 1728. Thomas III and IV are said to have
been consecrated by Bishop John, a scholar of great repute, who, with
one Bishop Basil, came from Antioch in 1685. During the r&eacute;gime
of Mar Thomas IV, and of his nephew Thomas V, Mar Gabriel, a Nestorian
Bishop, appeared on the scene in 1708. He seems to have been a man
without any definite creed, as he proclaimed himself a Nestorian, a
Jacobite, or a Romanist, according as one or the other best suited his
interests. He had his own friends and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb437" href="#pb437" name="pb437">437</a>]</span>admirers among the
Syrians, with whose support he ruled over a few churches in the north
till 1731. The consecration of Mar Thomas V by Mar Thomas IV was felt
to be invalid, and, to remedy the defect, the assistance of the Dutch
was sought; but, being disappointed, the Christians had recourse to a
Jewish merchant named Ezekiel, who undertook to convey their message to
the Patriarch of Antioch. He brought from Bassorah one Mar Ivanius, who
was a man of fiery temper. He interfered with the images in the
churches. This led to quarrels with the Metran, and he had forthwith to
quit the State. Through the Dutch authorities at Cochin, a fresh
requisition was sent to the Patriarch of Antioch, who sent out three
Bishops named Basil, John, and Gregory. Their arrival caused fresh
troubles, owing to the difficulty of paying the large sum claimed by
them as passage money. In 1761, Mar Thomas V, supposed to have died in
1765, consecrated his nephew Mar Thomas VI. About this time, Gregory
consecrated one Kurilos, the leader of a faction that resisted the rule
of Thomas VI. The disputes and quarrels which followed were ended with
the flight of Kurilos, who founded the See of Anjoor in the north of
Cochin and became the first Bishop of Tholiyur. Through the kind
intercession of the Mahar&#257;ja of Travancore, Thomas VI underwent
formal consecration at the hands of the Bishops from Antioch, and took
the title of Dionysius I, known also as Dionysius the Great. In 1775,
the great Carmelite father Paoli visited Mar Dionysius, and tried to
persuade him to submit to Rome. It is said that he agreed to the
proposal, on condition of his being recognised as Metropolitan of all
the Syrians in Malabar, but nothing came of it. A few years after this,
the struggle for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438"
name="pb438">438</a>]</span>supremacy between the Dutch and the English
had ended in the triumph of the latter, who evinced a good deal of
interest in the Syrian Christians, and, in 1805, the Madras Government
deputed Dr. Kerr to study the history of the Malabar Church. In 1809,
Dr. Buchanan visited Mar Dionysius, and broached the question of a
union of the Syrian Church with the Church of England. The proposal,
however, did not find favour with the Metropolitan, or his
congregation. Mar Dionysius died in 1808. Before his death, he had
consecrated Thomas Kathanar as Thomas VIII. He died in 1816. His
successor, Thomas IX, was weak and old, and he was displaced by Ittoop
Ramban, known as Pulik&#333;t Dionysius or Dionysius II. He enjoyed the
confidence and good-will of Colonel Munro, the British Resident,
through whose good offices a seminary had been built at Kottayam in
1813 for the education of Syrian youths. He died in 1818. Philixenos,
who had succeeded Kurilos as Bishop of Tholiyur, now consecrated
Punnathara Dionysius, or Dionysius III.</p>
<p>We have now to refer to an important incident in the history of the
Jacobite Syrians. Through the influence of the British Resident, and in
the hope of effecting the union proposed by Dr. Buchanan, the Church
Mission Society commenced their labours in 1816. The English
Missionaries began their work under favourable circumstances, and the
most cordial relations existed between the Syrians and the missionaries
for some years, so much so that the latter frequently visited the
Syrian churches, and even preached sermons. On the death of Dionysius
III in 1825, or as some say 1827, Cheppat Dionysius consecrated by Mar
Philixenos again, succeeded as Metropolitan under the title of
Dionysius IV. During his r&eacute;gime, there grew up among the Syrians
a party, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name=
"pb439">439</a>]</span>who suspected that the missionaries were using
their influence with the Metropolitan, and secretly endeavouring to
bring the Syrians under the Protestant Church. The conservative party
of Syrians stoutly opposed the movement. They petitioned the Patriarch
of Antioch, who at once sent out a Bishop named Athanasius. On arrival
in 1825, a large number of Syrians flocked to him. He even went to the
length of threatening Mar Dionysius with excommunication. But the
Protestant missionaries and the British Resident came to the rescue of
the Metropolitan, and exercised their influence with the ruler of
Travancore, who forthwith deported Athanasius. The deportation of
Athanasius strengthened the position of the missionaries. The British
Resident, and through his influence the native ruler, often rendered
them the most unqualified support. The missionaries who superintended
the education of the Syrian students in the seminary, having begun to
teach them doctrines contrary to those of the Jacobite Church, the
cordiality and friendship that had existed between the missionaries and
the Metropolitan gradually gave place to distrust and suspicion. The
party that clung to the time-honoured traditions and practices of their
church soon fanned the flame of discord, and snapped asunder the ties
of friendship that had bound the Metropolitan to the missionaries.
Bishop Wilson of Calcutta proceeded to Travancore to see if a
reconciliation could be effected. But his attempts in this direction
proved fruitless, because the Syrians could not accept his proposal to
adopt important changes affecting their spiritual and temporal
concerns, such as doing away with prayers for the dead, the revision of
their liturgy, the management of church funds, etc., and the Syrians
finally parted company with the missionaries in 1838. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href="#pb440" name="pb440">440</a>]</span>Soon
after this, disputes arose in regard to the funds and endowments of the
seminary, but they were soon settled by arbitration in 1840, and the
properties were divided between the Metropolitan and the missionaries.
The missionaries had friends among the Jacobites, some of whom became
members of the Church of England.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e6229width" id="pl6-439"><img src=
"images/pl6-439.jpg" alt="Mar Dionysius." width="535" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Mar Dionysius.</p>
</div>
<p>The Syrians were rather distressed, because they thought that the
consecration of their Metropolitan by Mar Philixenos was insufficient.
They therefore memorialised the Patriarch of Antioch. There grew up
also a party hostile to the Metropolitan, and they sent to Antioch a
Syrian Christian named Mathew. His arrival at Antioch was most
opportune. The Patriarch was looking out for a proper man. Mathew was
therefore welcomed, and treated very kindly. He was consecrated as
Metropolitan by the Patriarch himself in 1842, and sent out with the
necessary credentials. He arrived in 1843 as Metropolitan of Malankara
under the title of Mathew Anastatius, and advanced his claims to the
headship of the Church, but Mar Dionysius resisted him, and sent an
appeal to the Patriarch of Antioch, in which he denounced Mathew as one
who had enlisted his sympathies with the Protestant missionaries. Upon
this, the Patriarch sent out one Cyril with power to expel Mathew, and,
with the connivance of Mar Dionysius, Cyril cut the gordian knot by
appointing himself as Metropolitan of Malabar. Disputes arising, a
committee was appointed to examine the claims of Athanasius and Cyril.
The credentials of Cyril were proved to be forged, whereupon Athanasius
was duly installed in his office in 1862, and Cyril fled the country.
Cyril having failed, the Patriarch sent another Bishop named Stephanos,
who contributed his mite towards widening the breach, and, on the
British Resident having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href=
"#pb441" name="pb441">441</a>]</span>ordered the Bishop to quit the
country, an appeal was preferred to the Court of Directors, who
insisted on a policy of non-interference. This bestirred Mar Cyril, who
reappeared on the scene, and fanned the flame of discord. Being ordered
to leave Mar Athanasius unmolested, he and his friends sent one Joseph
to Antioch, who returned with fresh credentials in 1866, assumed the
title of Dionysius V, claimed the office of Metropolitan, and applied
to the Travancore Government for assistance. Adopting a policy of
non-interference, the darbar referred him to the Law Courts, in case he
could not come to terms with Mar Athanasius. The Patriarch of Antioch
himself visited Cochin and Travancore in 1874, and presided over a
Synod which met at Mulanthurutha in the Cochin State. Resolutions
affirming the supremacy of Antioch, recognising Mar Dionysius as the
accredited Metropolitan of Malabar, and condemning Mathew Athanasius as
a schismatic, were passed by the members of the assembly, and the
Patriarch returned to Mardin in 1876. This, however, did not mend
matters, and the two parties launched themselves into a protracted law
suit in 1879, which ended in favour of Mar Dionysius in 1889. Mar
Athanasius, who had taken up an independent position, died in 1875, and
his cousin, whom he had consecrated, succeeded as Metropolitan under
the title of Mar Thomas Anastatius. He died in 1893, and Titus Mar
Thoma, consecrated likewise by his predecessor, presides over the
Reformed Party of Jacobite Syrians, who prefer to be called St.
Thomas&rsquo; Syrians. We have thus traced the history of the Jacobite
Syrians from 1653, and shown how they separated themselves into two
parties, now represented by the Jacobite Syrians under Mar Dionysius,
owing allegiance to the Patriarch of Antioch, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442" name="pb442">442</a>]</span>the
Reformed Syrians or St. Thomas&rsquo; Syrians owning Titus Mar Thoma as
their supreme spiritual head. Thus, while the Jacobite Syrians have
accepted and acknowledged the ecclesiastical supremacy of the Patriarch
of Antioch, the St. Thomas&rsquo; Syrians, maintaining that the
Jacobite creed was introduced into Malabar only in the seventeenth
century after a section of the church had shaken off the Roman
supremacy, uphold the ecclesiastical autonomy of the church, whereby
the supreme control of the spiritual and temporal affairs of the church
is declared to be in the hands of the Metropolitan of Malabar. The St.
Thomas&rsquo; Syrians hold that the consecration of a Bishop by, or
with the sanction of the Patriarch of Babylon, Alexandria or Antioch,
gives no more validity or sanctity to that office than consecration by
the Metropolitan of Malabar, the supreme head of the church in Malabar,
inasmuch as this church is as ancient and apostolic as any other, being
founded by the apostle St. Thomas; while the Jacobites hold that the
consecration of a Bishop is not valid, unless it be done with the
sanction of their Patriarch. The St. Thomas&rsquo; Syrians have,
however, no objection to receiving consecration from the head of any
other episcopal apostolic church, but they consider that such
consecrations do not in any way subject their church to the supremacy
of that prelate or church.</p>
<p>Both the Latins and the Romo-Syrians use the liturgy of the Church
of Rome, the former using the Latin, and the latter the Syriac
language. It is believed by some that the Christians of St. Thomas
formerly used the liturgy of St. Ad&aelig;us, East Syrian, Edessa, but
that it was almost completely assimilated to the Roman liturgy by
Portuguese Jesuits at the Synod of Diamper <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name="pb443">443</a>]</span>in
1599. The Chald&aelig;an Syrians also use the Roman liturgy, with the
following points of difference in practice, communicated to me by their
present ecclesiastical head:&mdash;(1) They perform marriage ceremonies
on Sundays, instead of week days as the Romo-Syrians do. (2) While
reading the Gospel, their priests turn to the congregation, whereas the
Romo-Syrian priests turn to the altar. (3) Their priests bless the
congregation in the middle of the mass, a practice not in vogue among
the Romo-Syrians. (4) They use two kinds of consecrated oil in baptism,
which does away with the necessity of confirmation. The Romo-Syrians,
on the other hand, use only one kind of oil, and hence they have to be
subsequently confirmed by one of their Bishops.</p>
<p>The liturgy used by the Jacobite Syrians and the St. Thomas&rsquo;
Syrians is the same, viz., that of St. James. The St. Thomas&rsquo;
Syrians have, however, made some changes by deleting certain passages
from it. [A recent writer observes that &ldquo;a service which I
attended at the quaint old Syrian church at K&#333;ttayam, which
glories in the possession of one of the three ancient stone crosses in
India, closely resembled, as far as my memory serves me, one which I
attended many years ago at Antioch, except that the non-sacramental
portions of the mass were read in Malay&#257;lam instead of in Arabic,
the sacramental words alone being in both cases spoken in the ancient
Syriac tongue.] In regard to doctrine and practice, the following
points may be noted:&mdash;(1) While the Jacobite Syrians look upon the
Holy Bible as the main authority in matters of doctrine, practice, and
ritual, they do not allow the Bible to be interpreted except with the
help of the traditions of the church, the writings of the early
Fathers, and the decrees of the Holy Synods <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name="pb444">444</a>]</span>of
the undivided Christian period; but the St. Thomas&rsquo; Syrians
believe that the Holy Bible is unique and supreme in such matters. (2)
While the Jacobites have faith in the efficacy and necessity of
prayers, charities, etc., for the benefit of departed souls, of the
invocation of the Virgin Mary and the Saints in divine worship, of
pilgrimages, and of confessing sins to, and obtaining absolution from
priests, the St. Thomas&rsquo; Syrians regard these and similar
practices as unscriptural, tending not to the edification of believers,
but to the drawing away of the minds of believers from the vital and
real spiritual truths of the Christian Revelation. (3) While the
Jacobites administer the Lord&rsquo;s Supper to the laity and the
non-celebrating clergy in the form of consecrated bread dipped in
consecrated wine, and regard it a sin to administer the elements
separately after having united them in token of Christ&rsquo;s
resurrection, the St. Thomas&rsquo; Syrians admit the laity to both the
elements after the act of uniting them. (4) While the Jacobite Syrians
allow marriage ceremonies on Sundays, on the plea that, being of the
nature of a sacrament, they ought to be celebrated on Sundays, and that
Christ himself had taken part in a marriage festival on the Sabbath
day, the St. Thomas&rsquo; Syrians prohibit such celebrations on
Sundays as unscriptural, the Sabbath being set apart for rest and
religious exercises. (5) While the Jacobites believe that the mass is
as much a memorial of Christ&rsquo;s oblation on the cross as it is an
unbloody sacrifice offered for the remission of the sins of the living
and of the faithful dead, the St. Thomas&rsquo; Syrians observe it as a
commemoration of Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice on the cross. (6) The
Jacobites venerate the cross and the relics of Saints, while the St.
Thomas&rsquo; Syrians regard the practice as idolatry. (7) The
Jacobites perform mass for the dead, while the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445" name="pb445">445</a>]</span>St.
Thomas&rsquo; Syrians regard it as unscriptural. (8) With the
Jacobites, remarriage, marriage of widows, and marriage after admission
to full priesthood, reduce a priest to the status of a layman, and one
united in any such marriage is not permitted to perform priestly
functions, whereas priests of the St. Thomas&rsquo; Syrian party are
allowed to contract such marriages without forfeiture of their priestly
rights. (9) The Jacobite Syrians believe in the efficacy of infant
baptism, and acknowledge baptismal regeneration, while the St.
Thomas&rsquo; Syrians, who also baptise infants, deny the doctrine of
regeneration in baptism, and regard the ceremony as a mere external
sign of admission to church communion. (10) The Jacobites observe
special fasts, and abstain from certain articles of food during such
fasts, while the St. Thomas&rsquo; Syrians regard the practice as
superstitious.</p>
<p>The Jacobite Syrian priests are not paid any fixed salary, but are
supported by voluntary contributions in the shape of fees for baptism,
marriages, funerals, etc. The Romo-Syrian and Latin priests are paid
fixed salaries, besides the above perquisites. The Syrian priests are
called Kathanars, while the Latin priests go by the name of
P&#257;dres. For the Jacobite Syrians, the morone or holy oil required
for baptism, consecration of churches, ordination of priests, etc., has
to be obtained from Antioch. The churches under Rome get it from Rome.
Unlike the Catholic clergy, the Jacobite clergy, except their
Metropolitan and the Rambans, are allowed to marry.</p>
<p>The generality of Syrians of the present day trace their descent
from the higher orders of the Hindu society, and the observance by many
of them of certain customs prevalent more or less among high-caste
Hindus bears out this fact. It is no doubt very curious that, in spite
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href="#pb446" name=
"pb446">446</a>]</span>of their having been Christians for centuries
together, they still retain the traditions of their Hindu forefathers.
It may sound very strange, but it is none the less true, that caste
prejudices which influence their Hindu brethren in all social and
domestic relations obtain to some extent among some sections of the
Syrian Christians, but, with the spread of a better knowledge of the
teachings of Christ, the progress of English education, and contact
with European Christians, caste observances are gradually dying out.
The following relics of old customs may, however, be noted:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Some Christians make offerings to Hindu temples with as much
reverence as they do in their own churches.</p>
<p>Some non-Br&#257;hman Hindus likewise make offerings to Christian
churches.</p>
<p>(2) Some sections of Syrians have faith in horoscopes, and get them
cast for new-born babies, just as Hindus do.</p>
<p>(3) On the wedding day, the bridegroom ties round the neck of the
bride a t&#257;li (small ornament made of gold). This custom is
prevalent among all classes of Native Christians. On the death of their
husbands, some even remove the t&#257;li to indicate widowhood, as is
the custom among the Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p>(4) When a person dies, his or her children, if any, and near
relatives, observe pula (death pollution) for a period ranging from ten
to fifteen days. The observance imposes abstinence from animal food.
The pula ends with a religious ceremony in the church, with feasting
friends and relatives in the house, and feeding the poor, according to
one&rsquo;s means. Sr&#257;dha, or anniversary ceremony for the soul of
the dead, is performed with services in the church and feasts in the
house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb447" href="#pb447" name=
"pb447">447</a>]</span></p>
<p>(5) In rural parts especially, the &#332;nam festival of the
Malay&#257;li Hindus is celebrated with great <i>&eacute;clat</i>, with
feasting, making presents of cloths to children and relatives, out-door
and in-door games, etc.</p>
<p>(6) Vishu, or new-year&rsquo;s day, is likewise a gala day, when
presents of small coins are made to children, relatives, and the
poor.</p>
<p>(7) The ceremony of first feeding a child with rice
(annapr&#257;sanam or ch&#333;r&#363;nu of the Hindus) is celebrated
generally in the sixth month after birth. Parents often make vows to
have the ceremony done in a particular church, as Hindu parents take
their children to particular temples in fulfilment of special vows.</p>
<p>(8) The Syrians do not admit within their premises low-castes,
<i>e.g.</i>, Pulayans, Paraiyans, etc., even after the conversion of
the latter to Christianity. They enforce even distance pollution,
though not quite to the same extent as Malay&#257;li Hindus do. Iluvans
are allowed admission to their houses, but are not allowed to cook
their meals. In some parts, they are not even allowed to enter the
houses of Syrians.</p>
<p>There are no intermarriages between Syrians of the various
denominations and Latin Catholics. Under very exceptional
circumstances, a Romo-Syrian contracts a marriage with one of Latin
rite, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, but this entails many difficulties
and disabilities on the issues. Among the Latins themselves, there are,
again, no intermarriages between the communities of the seven hundred,
the five hundred, and the three hundred. The difference of cult and
creed has led to the prohibition of marriages between the Romo-Syrians
and Jacobite Syrians. The Jacobite Syrians properly so called, St.
Thomas&rsquo; Syrians, and the Syro-Protestants do, however,
intermarry. The Southerners and Northerners do not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448" name=
"pb448">448</a>]</span>intermarry; any conjugal ties effected between
them subject the former to some kind of social excommunication. This
exclusiveness, as we have already said, is claimed on the score of
their descent from the early colonists from Syria. The Syrians in
general, and the Jacobite Syrians in particular, are greater stricklers
to customs than other classes of Native Christians.</p>
<p>We have already referred to the privileges granted to the Syrians by
the Hindu kings in early times. They not only occupied a very high
position in the social scale, but also enjoyed at different times the
rare distinction of forming a section of the body-guard of the king and
the militia of the country. Education has of late made great progress
among them. The public service has now been thrown open to them, so
that those who have had the benefit of higher education now hold some
of the important posts in the State. In enterprises of all kinds, they
are considerably ahead of their Hindu and Musalman brethren, so that we
see them take very kindly to commerce, manufacture, agriculture, etc.;
in fact, in every walk of life, they are making their mark by their
industry and enterprise.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6297src" href=
"#xd21e6297" name="xd21e6297src">82</a></p>
<p>The following additional information is contained in the Gazetteer
of Malabar. &ldquo;The men are to be distinguished by the small cross
worn round the neck, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href=
"#pb449" name="pb449">449</a>]</span>women by their t&#257;li, which
has 21 beads on it, set in the form of a cross. Their churches are ugly
rectangular buildings with flat or arched wooden roofs and whitewashed
facades. They have no spire, but the chancel, which is at the east end,
is usually somewhat higher than the nave. Between the chancel and the
body of the church is a curtain, which is drawn while the priest
consecrates the elements at the mass. Right and left of the chancel are
two rooms, the vestry and the sacristy. At the west end is a gallery,
in which the unmarried priests sometimes live. Most churches contain
three altars, one in the chancel, and the other two at its western ends
on each side. There are no images in Jacobite or Reformed churches, but
there are sometimes pictures. Crucifixes are placed on the altars, and
in other parts of the churches. The clergy and men of influence are
buried in the nave just outside the chancel. The Syrian Bishops are
called Metr&#257;ns. They are celibates, and live on the contributions
of their churches. They wear purple robes and black silk cowls figured
with golden crosses, a big gold cross round the neck, and a ring on the
fourth finger of the right hand. Bishops are nominated by their
predecessors from the body of Rambans, who are men selected by priests
and elders in advance to fill the Episcopate. Metr&#257;ns are buried
in their robes in a sitting posture. Their priests are called
Cattanars. They should strictly pass through the seven offices of
ostiary, reader, exorcist, acolyte, sub-deacon and deacon before
becoming priests; but the first three offices practically no longer
exist. The priestly office is often hereditary, descending by the
marumakkatt&#257;yam system (inheritance in the female line). Jacobite
and St. Thomas&rsquo; Syrian priests are paid by contributions from
their parishioners, fees at weddings, and the like. Their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450" name=
"pb450">450</a>]</span>ordinary dress consists of white trousers, and a
kind of long white shirt with short sleeves and a flap hanging down
behind, supposed to be in the form of a cross. Over this the Jacobites
now wear a black coat. Priests are allowed to marry, except in the
Romo-Syrian community; but, among the Jacobites, a priest may not marry
after he has once been ordained, nor may he re-marry or marry a widow.
Malpans, or teachers, are the heads of the religious colleges, where
priests are trained. Jacobites also now shave clean, while other Syrian
priests wear the tonsure. Every church has not more than four Kaikkars
or churchwardens, who are elected from the body of parishioners. They
are the trustees of the church property, and, with the priest,
constitute a disciplinary body, which exercises considerable powers in
religious and social matters over the members of the congregation. The
Romo-Syrians follow the doctrines and ritual of the Roman Catholics,
but they use a Syriac version<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6306src" href=
"#xd21e6306" name="xd21e6306src">83</a> of the Latin liturgy. Jacobites
and St. Thomas&rsquo; Christians use the Syriac liturgy of St. James.
Few even of the priests understand Syriac, and, in the Reformed Syrian
churches, a Malay&#257;lam translation of the Syriac liturgy has now
been generally adopted. The Jacobites say masses for the dead, but do
not believe in purgatory; they invoke the Virgin Mary, venerate the
cross and relics of saints; they recognise only three sacraments,
baptism, marriage (which they always celebrate on Sundays) and the
mass; they prescribe auricular confession before mass, and at the mass
administer the bread dipped in the wine; they recite the Eastern form
of the Nicene Creed, and discourage laymen from studying the Bible. The
Reformed Syrians differ from them in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb451" href="#pb451" name="pb451">451</a>]</span>most of these points.
The Jacobites observe the ordinary festivals of the church; the day of
the patron saint of each church is celebrated with special pomp, and on
the offerings made on that day the priests largely depend for their
income. They keep Lent, which they call the fifty days&rsquo; fast,
strictly from the Sunday before Ash Wednesday, abjuring all meat, fish,
ghee, and toddy; and on Maundy Thursday they eat a special kind of
unsweetened cake marked with a cross, in the centre of which the
karnavan of the family should drive a nail, and drink a kanji of rice
and cocoanut-milk (the meal is said to symbolize the Passover and the
Last Supper, and the nail is supposed to be driven into the eye of
Judas Iscariot).</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Amongst the Syrian Christians, as amongst the M&#257;ppillas,
there are many survivals of Hindu customs and superstitions, and caste
prejudices have by no means disappeared amongst the various sections of
the community. Southerners and Northerners will not intermarry, and
families who trace their descent from Br&#257;hmans and N&#257;yars
will, in many cases, not admit lower classes to their houses, much less
allow them to cook for them or touch them. Most of the Syrians observe
the &#332;nam and <span class="corr" id="xd21e6318" title=
"Source: Vishu">Vishnu</span> festivals; the astrologer is frequently
consulted to cast horoscopes and tell omens; while it is a common
custom for persons suffering from diseases to seek a cure by buying
silver or tin images of the diseased limb, which their priest has
blessed. Similar survivals are to be noticed in their social
ceremonies. A Pulikudi ceremony, similar to that of the Hindus, was
commonly performed till recently, though it has now fallen into disuse.
Immediately on the birth of a child, three drops of honey in which gold
has been rubbed are poured into its mouth by its father, and the mother
is considered to be under pollution till the tenth day. Baptism takes
place on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452" name=
"pb452">452</a>]</span>fourteenth day amongst the Southern Jacobites,
and amongst other divisions on the fifty-sixth day. A rice-giving
ceremony similar to the Hindu Ch&#333;runnu is still sometimes
performed in the fifth or sixth month, when the child is presented by
the mother with a gold cross, if a boy, or a small gold coin or
tal&#363;vam if a girl, to be worn round the neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the Jacobites early marriage was the rule until
comparatively recently, boys being married at ten or twelve years of
age, and girls at six or seven. Now the more usual age for marriage is
sixteen in the case of boys, and twelve in the case of girls. Weddings
take place on Sundays, and, amongst the Northerners, may be celebrated
in either the bride&rsquo;s or the bridegroom&rsquo;s parish church. On
the two Sundays before the wedding, the banns have to be called in the
two churches, and the marriage agreements concluded in the presence of
the parish priests (Ottu kaly&#257;nam). The dowry, which is an
essential feature of Syrian weddings, is usually paid on the Sunday
before the wedding. It should consist of an odd number of rupees, and
should be tied up in a cloth. On the Thursday before the wedding day,
the house is decorated with rice flour, and on the Saturday the
marriage pandal (booth), is built. The first ceremonial takes place on
Saturday night when bride and bridegroom both bathe, and the latter is
shaved. Next morning both bride and bridegroom attend the ordinary
mass, the bridegroom being careful to enter the church before the
bride. Now-a-days both are often dressed more or less in European
fashion, and it is essential that the bride should wear as many jewels
as she has got, or can borrow for the occasion. Before leaving his
house, the bridegroom is blessed by his guru to whom he gives a present
(dakshina) of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href="#pb453" name=
"pb453">453</a>]</span>clothes and money. He is accompanied by a
bestman, usually his sister&rsquo;s husband, who brings the t&#257;li.
After mass, a tithe (pathuvaram) of the bride&rsquo;s dowry is paid to
the church as the marriage fee, a further fee to the priest
(kaikasturi), and a fee called kaimuttupanam for the bishop. The
marriage service is then read, and, at its conclusion, the bridegroom
ties the t&#257;li round the bride&rsquo;s neck with threads taken from
her veil, making a special kind of knot, while the priest holds the
t&#257;li in front. The priest and the bridegroom then put a veil
(mantravadi) over the bride&rsquo;s head. The t&#257;li should not be
removed so long as the girl is married, and should be buried with her.
The veil should also be kept for her funeral. The bridal party returns
home in state, special umbrellas being held over the bride and
bridegroom. At the gate they are met by the bride&rsquo;s sister
carrying a lighted lamp, and she washes the bridegroom&rsquo;s feet.
The married couple then go to the pandal, where they are ceremonially
fed with sweets and plantains by the priest and by representatives of
their two families, to the accompaniment of the women&rsquo;s kurava
(cry), and in the presence of the guests, who are seated in order of
precedence, the chief persons having seats of honour covered with black
rugs and white cloths (vellayum karimbadavum), traditionally a regal
honour. The bride and bridegroom are then led into the house by the
bestman and bride&rsquo;s uncle, the bride being careful to enter it
right foot first; and the guests are feasted in order of rank. It is a
peculiar custom of the Syrian Christians at these feasts to double up
the ends of the plantain leaves which serve them as plates, and is
supposed to be symbolical of the royal privilege of eating off a double
plate. Until the following Wednesday, the bestman sleeps with the
bridegroom in the bridal chamber, the bride occupying <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb454" href="#pb454" name=
"pb454">454</a>]</span>another room. On Wednesday evening comes the
ceremony called n&#257;l&#257;m kuli, or fourth day bath. The
bridegroom and the bestman, who are in the bridal chamber, lock the
door; the bride&rsquo;s mother knocks and begs the bridegroom to come
out, which he at last does after she has sung a song (vathilturapattu)
celebrating the attractions and virtues of the bride. The bridegroom
and bride then bathe, dress in new clothes, and go to the pandal, where
they perform paradakshinams round a lighted lamp, and the bridegroom
gives cloths to the bride&rsquo;s uncle, mother, and grand-parents. The
married couple are then escorted to the bridal chamber, which has in
the interval been cleaned and prepared for them. The next morning they
have to go to the bridegroom&rsquo;s or bride&rsquo;s house as the case
may be, and there eat together and go through a ceremonial similar to
that which they performed on the wedding day in the other house. This
concludes the marriage ceremonies, but on Sunday the bridegroom and
bride should attend mass together in the bride&rsquo;s parish church if
they were married in the bridegroom&rsquo;s, and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>. Amongst the Southern Jacobites, the ceremonies are
very similar, but the dowry is not paid till the marriage day, or till
the girl&rsquo;s first confinement. Half the pathuvaram is paid to the
priest instead of a kaikasturi, and the bridegroom puts a ring on the
bride&rsquo;s finger during the marriage service. After the church
service, the couple go to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, where they are
fed ceremonially by the bride&rsquo;s mother, and the subsequent feast
is at the expense of the bride&rsquo;s people. On Monday morning, the
bridegroom is ceremonially fed by the bride&rsquo;s mother in the
bridal chamber (manav&#257;lan ch&#333;ru), and in the evening there is
a ceremony called manav&#257;lan tazhukkal, in which the bride and
bridegroom are embraced in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb455" href=
"#pb455" name="pb455">455</a>]</span>turn by their respective parents
and relations, after which there is a feast with singing of hymns.
Before the couple leave for the bride&rsquo;s house on Thursday, there
is a big feast, called kudivirunnu, given by the bridegroom to the
bride&rsquo;s people, followed by a ceremony called vilakku toduga, in
which men and women sing hymns and dance round a lighted lamp, which
they touch at intervals. Amongst the Romo-Syrians and the Reformed
sect, the marriage ceremonies have less trace of Hindu ritual; they do
not celebrate weddings on Sundays, and have no n&#257;l&#257;m kuli
ceremony, but a t&#257;li is usually tied in addition to the giving of
a ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At funerals (except amongst the Reformed sect) it is usual
for each of the dead man&rsquo;s connections to bring a cloth to serve
as a shroud. Before the body is lowered into the grave, holy oil is
poured into the eyes, nostrils and ears. The mourners are under
pollution, and fast till the day of the second funeral or pula kuli
(purification), and till then masses should be said daily for the dead.
The pula kuli is celebrated usually on the 11th day, but may be
deferred till the 15th, 17th or 21st, or sometimes to the 41st. The
mourners are incensed, while hymns are sung and prayers offered. Each
then gives a contribution of money to the priest, and receives in
return a pinch of cummin. A feast is then given to the neighbours and
the poor. On the 40th day there is another feast, at which meat is
eaten by the mourners for the first time. A requiem mass should be said
each month on the day of death for twelve months, and on the first
anniversary the mourning concludes with a feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the foregoing account of the Syrian Christians, a few stray notes
may be added. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb456" href="#pb456" name=
"pb456">456</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is recorded by Sir M. E. Grant Duff, formerly Governor of
Madras,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6341src" href="#xd21e6341" name=
"xd21e6341src">84</a> that &ldquo;the interesting body known as the
Syrian Christians or Christians of St. Thomas is divided into several
groups much opposed to each other. In an excellent address presented to
me they said that this was the occasion which, for the first time after
ages of separation, witnessed the spectacle of all the different sects
of their community, following divergent articles of faith, sinking for
once their religious differences to do honour to their
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some years ago, the wife of a District Judge of Calicut asked the
pupils of a school how long they had been Christians. &ldquo;We
were,&rdquo; came the crushing reply, &ldquo;Christians when you
English were worshipping Druids, and stained with woad.&rdquo; More
recently, the master at a college in Madras called on all Native
Christians in his class to stand up. Noticing that one boy remained
seated, he called on him for an explanation, when the youth explained
that he was a Syrian Christian, and not a Native Christian.</p>
<p>It is noted by the Rev. W. J. Richards that &ldquo;at the very time
that our King John was pulling out Jews&rsquo; teeth to make them
surrender their treasures, Hindu princes were protecting Jewish and
Christian subjects, whose ancestors had been honoured by Royal grants
for hundreds of years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Southerners say that they can be distinguished from the
Northerners by the red tinge of their hair. A man with reddish
moustache, and a dark-skinned baby with brilliant red hair, whose
father had red whiskers, were produced before me in support of the
claim. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb457" href="#pb457" name=
"pb457">457</a>]</span></p>
<p>As examples of Old and New Testament names occurring, in a changed
form, among Syrian Christians, the following may be cited:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Abraham, Abragam.</li>
<li>Joshua, K&#333;shi.</li>
<li>Peter, Puthr&#333;s, Ittiyerah, Itte.</li>
<li>Paul, Powlos.</li>
<li>John, Yohan, Sonanan, Ch&#333;na.</li>
<li>Titus, Tet&#333;s.</li>
<li>Matthew, Mathai, M&#257;then.</li>
<li>Philip, Philippos, Papi, Eippe, Eapen.</li>
<li>Thomas, Th&#333;ma, Thommi, Thommen.</li>

<li>Elizabeth, Elspeth, Elia, Elach&#257;.</li>
<li>Rachael, R&#257;chi, R&#257;ghael, Ch&#257;cha.</li>
</ul>
<p>Syrian Christians take the name of their father, their own name, and
that of their residence. Whence arise such names as Edazayhikkal Mathoo
Philippos, Kunnampuram Thommen Ch&#257;ndi, and Chandakadayil Joseph
Chommi.</p>
<p>I have seen some Syrian Christian men tattooed with a cross on the
upper arm, and a cross and their initials on the forearm.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I may, for the sake of comparison, place on record
the averages of the more important physical measurements of Northerner
and Southerner Syrian Christians and N&#257;yars. <span class=

<p>It may be noted that, in his &lsquo;Letters from Malabar,&rsquo;
Canter Visscher, in the middle of the eighteenth century, writes that
the St. Thomas&rsquo; Christians &ldquo;keep very strict genealogical
records, and they will neither marry nor in any way intermingle with
the new low-caste Christians, being themselves mostly Castade Naiross,
that is, nobility of the <span class="corr" id="xd21e6486" title=
"Source: Nayar">N&#257;yar</span> caste, in token of which they
generally carry a sword in the hand, as a mark of dignity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is stated by E. Petersen and F. V. Luschan<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6491src" href="#xd21e6491" name="xd21e6491src">85</a> that
&ldquo;probably a single people originally occupied the greater part of
Asia Minor. They are still represented as a compact group by the
Armenians. The type resembles the Dissentis type of His and

skin dark, eyes dark, and hair dark and smooth. It extends through the
S. half of Asia Minor, N.E. to the Caucasus, and E. to the Upper
Euphrates. The Tachtadschy people, a hill people living without serious
mixture with other peoples, give measurements closely like the
Armenians.&rdquo; [The cephalic index of Armenians is given by E.

*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TRIBES OF SOUTHERN INDIA ***

***** This file should be named 42996-h.htm or 42996-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:
        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/2/9/9/42996/

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg.


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
