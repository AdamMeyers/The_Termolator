PREFACE.



  The want of an interesting work on Greek and Roman mythology, suitable
  for the requirements of both boys and girls, has long been recognized by
  the principals of our advanced schools. The study of the classics
  themselves, even where the attainments of the pupil have rendered this
  feasible, has not been found altogether successful in giving to the
  student a clear and succinct idea of the religious beliefs of the
  ancients, and it has been suggested that a work which would so deal with
  the subject as to render it at once interesting and instructive would be
  hailed as a valuable introduction to the study of classic authors, and
  would be found to assist materially the labours of both master and
  pupil.

  In endeavouring to supply this want I have sought to place before the
  reader a lifelike picture of the deities of classical times as they were
  conceived and worshipped by the ancients themselves, and thereby to
  awaken in the minds of young students a desire to become more intimately
  acquainted with the noble productions of classical antiquity.

  It has been my aim to render the Legends, which form the second
  portion of the work, a picture, as it were, of old Greek life; its
  customs, its superstitions, and its princely hospitalities, for which
  reason they are given at somewhat greater length than is usual in works
  of the kind.

  In a chapter devoted to the purpose some interesting particulars have
  been collected respecting the public worship of the ancient Greeks and
  Romans (more especially of the former), to which is subjoined an account
  of their principal festivals.

  I may add that no pains have been spared in order that, without
  passing over details the omission of which would have  !-- Page ii
  -->[ii]marred the
  completeness of the work, not a single passage should be found which
  could possibly offend the most scrupulous delicacy; and also that I have
  purposely treated the subject with that reverence which I consider due to
  every religious system, however erroneous.

  It is hardly necessary to dwell upon the importance of the study of
  Mythology: our poems, our novels, and even our daily journals teem with
  classical allusions; nor can a visit to our art galleries and museums be
  fully enjoyed without something more than a mere superficial knowledge of
  a subject which has in all ages inspired painters, sculptors, and poets.
  It therefore only remains for me to express a hope that my little work
  may prove useful, not only to teachers and scholars, but also to a large
  class of general readers, who, in whiling away a leisure hour, may derive
  some pleasure and profit from its perusal.

MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF ANCIENT GREECE AND ROME.



PART I.       MYTHS.



INTRODUCTION.

  Before entering upon the many strange beliefs of the ancient Greeks,
  and the extraordinary number of gods they worshipped, we must first
  consider what kind of beings these divinities were.

  In appearance, the gods were supposed to resemble mortals, whom,
  however, they far surpassed in beauty, grandeur, and strength; they were
  also more commanding in stature, height being considered by the Greeks an
  attribute of beauty in man or woman. They resembled human beings in their
  feelings and habits, intermarrying and having children, and requiring
  daily nourishment to recruit their strength, and refreshing sleep to
  restore their energies. Their blood, a bright ethereal fluid called
  Ichor, never engendered disease, and, when shed, had the power of
  producing new life.

  The Greeks believed that the mental qualifications of their gods were
  of a much higher order than those of men, but nevertheless, as we shall
  see, they were not considered to be exempt from human passions, and we
  frequently behold them actuated by revenge, deceit, and jealousy. They,
  however, always punish the evil-doer, and visit with dire calamities any
  impious mortal who dares to neglect their worship or despise their rites.
  We often hear of them visiting mankind and partaking of their
  hospitality, and not unfrequently both gods and goddesses  !-- Page 8
  -->[8]become attached to
  mortals, with whom they unite themselves, the offspring of these unions
  being called heroes or demi-gods, who were usually renowned for their
  great strength and courage. But although there were so many points of
  resemblance between gods and men, there remained the one great
  characteristic distinction, viz., that the gods enjoyed immortality.
  Still, they were not invulnerable, and we often hear of them being
  wounded, and suffering in consequence such exquisite torture that they
  have earnestly prayed to be deprived of their privilege of
  immortality.

  The gods knew no limitation of time or space, being able to transport
  themselves to incredible distances with the speed of thought. They
  possessed the power of rendering themselves invisible at will, and could
  assume the forms of men or animals as it suited their convenience. They
  could also transform human beings into trees, stones, animals,      c.,
  either as a punishment for their misdeeds, or as a means of protecting
  the individual, thus transformed, from impending danger. Their robes were
  like those worn by mortals, but were perfect in form and much finer in
  texture. Their weapons also resembled those used by mankind; we hear of
  spears, shields, helmets, bows and arrows,      c., being employed by the
  gods. Each deity possessed a beautiful chariot, which, drawn by horses or
  other animals of celestial breed, conveyed them rapidly over land and sea
  according to their pleasure. Most of these divinities lived on the summit
  of Mount Olympus, each possessing his or her individual habitation, and
  all meeting together on festive occasions in the council-chamber of the
  gods, where their banquets were enlivened by the sweet strains of
  Apollo's lyre, whilst the beautiful voices of the Muses poured forth
  their rich melodies to his harmonious accompaniment. Magnificent temples
  were erected to their honour, where they were worshipped with the
  greatest solemnity; rich gifts were presented to them, and animals, and
  indeed sometimes human beings, were sacrificed on their altars.

  In the study of Grecian mythology we meet with some  !-- Page 9
  -->[9]curious, and what
  may at first sight appear unaccountable notions. Thus we hear of terrible
  giants hurling rocks, upheaving mountains, and raising earthquakes which
  engulf whole armies; these ideas, however, may be accounted for by the
  awful convulsions of nature, which were in operation in pre-historic
  times. Again, the daily recurring phenomena, which to us, who know them
  to be the result of certain well-ascertained laws of nature, are so
  familiar as to excite no remark, were, to the early Greeks, matter of
  grave speculation, and not unfrequently of alarm. For instance, when they
  heard the awful roar of thunder, and saw vivid flashes of lightning,
  accompanied by black clouds and torrents of rain, they believed that the
  great god of heaven was angry, and they trembled at his wrath. If the
  calm and tranquil sea became suddenly agitated, and the crested billows
  rose mountains high, dashing furiously against the rocks, and threatening
  destruction to all within their reach, the sea-god was supposed to be in
  a furious rage. When they beheld the sky glowing with the hues of coming
  day they thought that the goddess of the dawn, with rosy fingers, was
  drawing aside the dark veil of night, to allow her brother, the sun-god,
  to enter upon his brilliant career. Thus personifying all the powers of
  nature, this very imaginative and highly poetical nation beheld a
  divinity in every tree that grew, in every stream that flowed, in the
  bright beams of the glorious sun, and the clear, cold rays of the silvery
  moon; for them the whole universe lived and breathed, peopled by a
  thousand forms of grace and beauty.

  The most important of these divinities may have been something more
  than the mere creations of an active and poetical imagination. They were
  possibly human beings who had so distinguished themselves in life by
  their preeminence over their fellow-mortals that after death they were
  deified by the people among whom they lived, and the poets touched with
  their magic wand the details of lives, which, in more prosaic times,
  would simply have been recorded as illustrious.  span
  class="pagenum">[10]

  It is highly probable that the reputed actions of these deified beings
  were commemorated by bards, who, travelling from one state to another,
  celebrated their praise in song; it therefore becomes exceedingly
  difficult, nay almost impossible, to separate bare facts from the
  exaggerations which never fail to accompany oral traditions.

  In order to exemplify this, let us suppose that Orpheus, the son of
  Apollo, so renowned for his extraordinary musical powers, had existed at
  the present day. We should no doubt have ranked him among the greatest of
  our musicians, and honoured him as such; but the Greeks, with their vivid
  imagination and poetic license, exaggerated his remarkable gifts, and
  attributed to his music supernatural influence over animate and inanimate
  nature. Thus we hear of wild beasts tamed, of mighty rivers arrested in
  their course, and of mountains being moved by the sweet tones of his
  voice. The theory here advanced may possibly prove useful in the future,
  in suggesting to the reader the probable basis of many of the
  extraordinary accounts we meet with in the study of classical
  mythology.

  And now a few words will be necessary concerning the religious beliefs
  of the Romans. When the Greeks first settled in Italy they found in the
  country they colonized a mythology belonging to the Celtic inhabitants,
  which, according to the Greek custom of paying reverence to all gods,
  known or unknown, they readily adopted, selecting and appropriating those
  divinities which had the greatest affinity to their own, and thus they
  formed a religious belief which naturally bore the impress of its ancient
  Greek source. As the primitive Celts, however, were a less civilized
  people than the Greeks, their mythology was of a more barbarous
  character, and this circumstance, combined with the fact that the Romans
  were not gifted with the vivid imagination of their Greek neighbours,
  leaves its mark on the Roman mythology, which is far less fertile in
  fanciful conceits, and deficient in all those fairy-like stories and
  wonderfully poetic ideas which so strongly characterize that of the
  Greeks.

ORIGIN OF THE WORLD.       FIRST DYNASTY.

URANUS AND GÆA. (C       lus and Terra.)

  The ancient Greeks had several different theories with regard to the
  origin of the world, but the generally accepted notion was that before
  this world came into existence, there was in its place a confused mass of
  shapeless elements called Chaos. These elements becoming at length
  consolidated (by what means does not appear), resolved themselves into
  two widely different substances, the lighter portion of which, soaring on
  high, formed the sky or firmament, and constituted itself into a vast,
  overarching vault, which protected the firm and solid mass beneath.

  Thus came into being the two first great primeval deities of the
  Greeks, Uranus and Ge or Gæa.

  Uranus, the more refined deity, represented the light and air of
  heaven, possessing the distinguishing qualities of light, heat, purity,
  and omnipresence, whilst Gæa, the firm, flat, a name="NtA_1"
  href="#Nt_1">[1] life-sustaining earth, was worshipped as
  the great all-nourishing mother. Her many titles refer to her more or
  less in this character, and she appears to have been universally revered
  among the Greeks, there being scarcely a city in Greece which did not
  contain a temple erected in her honour; indeed Gæa was held in such
  veneration that her name was always invoked whenever the gods took a
  solemn oath, made an emphatic declaration, or implored assistance.

  Uranus, the heaven, was believed to have united himself in marriage
  with Gæa, the earth; and a moment's reflection will show what a truly
  poetical, and also what a logical idea this was; for, taken in a
  figurative sense,  a
  name="page12">[12]this union actually does exist. The smiles
  of heaven produce the flowers of earth, whereas his long-continued frowns
  exercise so depressing an influence upon his loving partner, that she no
  longer decks herself in bright and festive robes, but responds with ready
  sympathy to his melancholy mood.

  The first-born child of Uranus and Gæa was Oceanus, a name="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2">[2] the ocean stream, that vast expanse of
  ever-flowing water which encircled the earth. Here we meet with another
  logical though fanciful conclusion, which a very slight knowledge of the
  workings of nature proves to have been just and true. The ocean is formed
  from the rains which descend from heaven and the streams which flow from
  earth. By making Oceanus therefore the offspring of Uranus and Gæa, the
  ancients, if we take this notion in its literal sense, merely assert that
  the ocean is produced by the combined influence of heaven and earth,
  whilst at the same time their fervid and poetical imagination led them to
  see in this, as in all manifestations of the powers of nature, an actual,
  tangible divinity.

  But Uranus, the heaven, the embodiment of light, heat, and the breath
  of life, produced offspring who were of a much less material nature than
  his son Oceanus. These other children of his were supposed to occupy the
  intermediate space which divided him from Gæa. Nearest to Uranus, and
  just beneath him, came Aether (Ether), a bright creation representing
  that highly rarified atmosphere which immortals alone could breathe. Then
  followed Aër (Air), which was in close proximity to Gæa, and represented,
  as its name implies, the grosser atmosphere surrounding the earth which
  mortals could freely breathe, and without which they would perish. Aether
  and Aër were separated from each other by divinities called Nephelae.
  These were their restless and wandering sisters, who existed in the form
  of clouds, ever  a
  name="page13">[13]floating between Aether and Aër. Gæa also
  produced the mountains, and Pontus (the sea). She united herself with the
  latter, and their offspring were the sea-deities Nereus, Thaumas,
  Phorcys, Ceto, and Eurybia.

  Co-existent with Uranus and Gæa were two mighty powers who were also
  the offspring of Chaos. These were Erebus (Darkness) and Nyx (Night), who
  formed a striking contrast to the cheerful light of heaven and the bright
  smiles of earth. Erebus reigned in that mysterious world below where no
  ray of sunshine, no gleam of daylight, nor vestige of health-giving
  terrestrial life ever appeared. Nyx, the sister of Erebus, represented
  Night, and was worshipped by the ancients with the greatest
  solemnity.

  Uranus was also supposed to have been united to Nyx, but only in his
  capacity as god of light, he being considered the source and fountain of
  all light, and their children were Eos (Aurora), the Dawn, and Hemera,
  the Daylight. Nyx again, on her side was also doubly united, having been
  married at some indefinite period to Erebus.

  In addition to those children of heaven and earth already enumerated,
  Uranus and Gæa produced two distinctly different races of beings called
  Giants and Titans. The Giants personified brute strength alone, but the
  Titans united to their great physical power intellectual qualifications
  variously developed. There were three Giants, Briareus, Cottus, and
  Gyges, who each possessed a hundred hands and fifty heads, and were known
  collectively by the name of the Hecatoncheires, which signified
  hundred-handed. These mighty Giants could shake the universe and produce
  earthquakes; it is therefore evident that they represented those active
  subterranean forces to which allusion has been made in the opening
  chapter. The Titans were twelve in number; their names were: Oceanus,
  Ceos, Crios, Hyperion, Iapetus, Cronus, Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne,
  Ph       be, and Tethys.

  Now Uranus, the chaste light of heaven, the essence of all that is
  bright and pleasing, held in abhorrence his  span
  class="pagenum">[14]crude, rough, and
  turbulent offspring, the Giants, and moreover feared that their great
  power might eventually prove hurtful to himself. He therefore hurled them
  into Tartarus, that portion of the lower world which served as the
  subterranean dungeon of the gods. In order to avenge the oppression of
  her children, the Giants, Gæa instigated a conspiracy on the part of the
  Titans against Uranus, which was carried to a successful issue by her son
  Cronus. He wounded his father, and from the blood of the wound which fell
  upon the earth sprang a race of monstrous beings also called Giants.
  Assisted by his brother-Titans, Cronus succeeded in dethroning his
  father, who, enraged at his defeat, cursed his rebellious son, and
  foretold to him a similar fate. Cronus now became invested with supreme
  power, and assigned to his brothers offices of distinction, subordinate
  only to himself. Subsequently, however, when, secure of his position, he
  no longer needed their assistance, he basely repaid their former services
  with treachery, made war upon his brothers and faithful allies, and,
  assisted by the Giants, completely defeated them, sending such as
  resisted his all-conquering arm down into the lowest depths of
  Tartarus.



SECOND DYNASTY.

CRONUS (Saturn).

  Cronus was the god of time in its sense of eternal duration. He
  married Rhea, daughter of Uranus and Gæa, a very important divinity, to
  whom a special chapter will be devoted hereafter. Their children were,
  three sons: Aïdes (Pluto), Poseidon (Neptune), Zeus (Jupiter), and three
  daughters: Hestia (Vesta), Demeter (Ceres), and Hera (Juno). Cronus,
  having an uneasy conscience, was afraid that his children might one day
  rise up against his authority, and thus verify the prediction of his
  father  a
  name="page15">[15]Uranus. In order, therefore, to render the
  prophecy impossible of fulfilment, Cronus swallowed each child as soon as
  it was born,[3] greatly to
  the sorrow and indignation of his wife Rhea. When it came to Zeus, the
  sixth and last, Rhea resolved to try and save this one child at least, to
  love and cherish, and appealed to her parents, Uranus and Gæa, for
  counsel and assistance. By their advice she wrapped a stone in
  baby-clothes, and Cronus, in eager haste, swallowed it, without noticing
  the deception. The child thus saved, eventually, as we shall see,
  dethroned his father Cronus, became supreme god in his stead, and was
  universally venerated as the great national god of the Greeks.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0015-1.png"
      alt="Cronus" title="Cronus" />
  
  Anxious to preserve the secret of his existence from Cronus, Rhea sent
  the infant Zeus secretly to Crete, where he was nourished, protected, and
  educated. A sacred goat, called Amalthea, supplied the place of his
  mother, by providing him with milk; nymphs, called Melissae, fed him with
  honey, and eagles and doves brought him nectar and ambrosia. a
  name="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4">[4] He was kept concealed in a
  cave in the heart of Mount Ida, and the Curetes, or priests of Rhea, by
  beating their shields together, kept up a constant noise at the entrance,
  which drowned the cries of the child and frightened away all intruders.
  Under the watchful care of the Nymphs the infant Zeus throve rapidly,
  developing great physical powers, combined with  span
  class="pagenum">[16]extraordinary wisdom and
  intelligence. Grown to manhood, he determined to compel his father to
  restore his brothers and sisters to the light of day, and is said to have
  been assisted in this difficult task by the goddess Metis, who artfully
  persuaded Cronus to drink a potion, which caused him to give back the
  children he had swallowed. The stone which had counterfeited Zeus was
  placed at Delphi, where it was long exhibited as a sacred relic.

  Cronus was so enraged at being circumvented that war between the
  father and son became inevitable. The rival forces ranged themselves on
  two separate high mountains in Thessaly; Zeus, with his brothers and
  sisters, took his stand on Mount Olympus, where he was joined by Oceanus,
  and others of the Titans, who had forsaken Cronus on account of his
  oppressions. Cronus and his brother-Titans took possession of Mount
  Othrys, and prepared for battle. The struggle was long and fierce, and at
  length Zeus, finding that he was no nearer victory than before, bethought
  himself of the existence of the imprisoned Giants, and knowing that they
  would be able to render him most powerful assistance, he hastened to
  liberate them. He also called to his aid the Cyclops (sons of Poseidon
  and Amphitrite),[5] who had
  only one eye each in the middle of their foreheads, and were called
  Brontes (Thunder), Steropes (Lightning), and Pyracmon (Fire-anvil). They
  promptly responded to his summons for help, and brought with them
  tremendous thunderbolts which the Hecatoncheires, with their hundred
  hands, hurled down upon the enemy, at the same time raising mighty
  earthquakes, which swallowed up and destroyed all who opposed them. Aided
  by these new and powerful allies, Zeus now made a furious onslaught on
  his enemies, and so tremendous was the encounter that all nature is said
  to have throbbed in accord with this mighty effort of the celestial
  deities. The sea rose mountains high, and its angry billows  !-- Page 17
  -->[17]hissed and
  foamed; the earth shook to its foundations, the heavens sent forth
  rolling thunder, and flash after flash of death-bringing lightning,
  whilst a blinding mist enveloped Cronus and his allies.

  And now the fortunes of war began to turn, and victory smiled on Zeus.
  Cronus and his army were completely overthrown, his brothers despatched
  to the gloomy depths of the lower world, and Cronus himself was banished
  from his kingdom and deprived for ever of the supreme power, which now
  became vested in his son Zeus. This war was called the Titanomachia, and
  is most graphically described by the old classic poets.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0017-1.png"
      alt="Saturn" title="Saturn" />
  
  With the defeat of Cronus and his banishment from his dominions, his
  career as a ruling Greek divinity entirely ceases. But being, like all
  the gods, immortal, he was supposed to be still in existence, though
  possessing no longer either influence or authority, his place being
  filled to a certain extent by his descendant and successor, Zeus.

  Cronus is often represented as an old man leaning on a scythe, with an
  hour-glass in his hand. The hour-glass symbolizes the fast-fleeting
  moments as they succeed each other unceasingly; the scythe is
  emblematical of time, which mows down all before it.

SATURN.

  The Romans, according to their custom of identifying their deities
  with those of the Greek gods whose attributes were similar to their own,
  declared Cronus to be identical with their old agricultural divinity
  Saturn. They believed that after his defeat in the  span
  class="pagenum">[18]Titanomachia and his
  banishment from his dominions by Zeus, he took refuge with Janus, king of
  Italy, who received the exiled deity with great kindness, and even shared
  his throne with him. Their united reign became so thoroughly peaceful and
  happy, and was distinguished by such uninterrupted prosperity, that it
  was called the Golden Age.

  Saturn is usually represented bearing a sickle in the one hand and a
  wheat-sheaf in the other.

  A temple was erected to him at the foot of the Capitoline Hill, in
  which were deposited the public treasury and the laws of the state.

RHEA (Ops).

  Rhea, the wife of Cronus, and mother of Zeus and the other great gods
  of Olympus, personified the earth, and was regarded as the Great Mother
  and unceasing producer of all plant-life. She was also believed to
  exercise unbounded sway over the animal creation, more especially over
  the lion, the noble king of beasts. Rhea is generally represented wearing
  a crown of turrets or towers and seated on a throne, with lions crouching
  at her feet. She is sometimes depicted sitting in a chariot, drawn by
  lions.

  The principal seat of her worship, which was always of a very riotous
  character, was at Crete. At her festivals, which took place at night, the
  wildest music of flutes, cymbals, and drums resounded, whilst joyful
  shouts and cries, accompanied by dancing and loud stamping of feet,
  filled the air.

  This divinity was introduced into Crete by its first colonists from
  Phrygia, in Asia Minor, in which country she was worshipped under the
  name of Cybele. The people of Crete adored her as the Great Mother, more
  especially in her signification as the sustainer of the vegetable world.
  Seeing, however, that year by year, as winter appears, all her glory
  vanishes, her flowers fade, and her trees become leafless, they
  poetically expressed this process of nature under the figure of a lost
  love. She  a
  name="page19">[19]was said to have been tenderly attached to a
  youth of remarkable beauty, named Atys, who, to her grief and
  indignation, proved faithless to her. He was about to unite himself to a
  nymph called Sagaris, when, in the midst of the wedding feast, the rage
  of the incensed goddess suddenly burst forth upon all present. A panic
  seized the assembled guests, and Atys, becoming afflicted with temporary
  madness, fled to the mountains and destroyed himself. Cybele, moved with
  sorrow and regret, instituted a yearly mourning for his loss, when her
  priests, the Corybantes, with their usual noisy accompaniments, marched
  into the mountains to seek the lost youth. Having discovered him a
  name="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6">[6] they gave full vent to their
  ecstatic delight by indulging in the most violent gesticulations,
  dancing, shouting, and, at the same time, wounding and gashing themselves
  in a frightful manner.

OPS.

  In Rome the Greek Rhea was identified with Ops, the goddess of plenty,
  the wife of Saturn, who had a variety of appellations. She was called
  Magna-Mater, Mater-Deorum, Berecynthia-Idea, and also Dindymene. This
  latter title she acquired from three high mountains in Phrygia, whence
  she was brought to Rome as Cybele during the second Punic war,  span
  class="scac">B.C. 205, in obedience to an injunction contained in
  the Sybilline books. She was represented as a matron crowned with towers,
  seated in a chariot drawn by lions.



DIVISION OF THE WORLD.

  We will now return to Zeus and his brothers, who, having gained a
  complete victory over their enemies, began to consider how the world,
  which they had  a
  name="page20">[20]conquered, should be divided between them.
  At last it was settled by lot that Zeus should reign supreme in Heaven,
  whilst Aïdes governed the Lower World, and Poseidon had full command over
  the Sea, but the supremacy of Zeus was recognized in all three kingdoms,
  in heaven, on earth (in which of course the sea was included), and under
  the earth. Zeus held his court on the top of Mount Olympus, whose summit
  was beyond the clouds; the dominions of Aïdes were the gloomy unknown
  regions below the earth; and Poseidon reigned over the sea. It will be
  seen that the realm of each of these gods was enveloped in mystery.
  Olympus was shrouded in mists, Hades was wrapt in gloomy darkness, and
  the sea was, and indeed still is, a source of wonder and deep interest.
  Hence we see that what to other nations were merely strange phenomena,
  served this poetical and imaginative people as a foundation upon which to
  build the wonderful stories of their mythology.

  The division of the world being now satisfactorily arranged, it would
  seem that all things ought to have gone on smoothly, but such was not the
  case. Trouble arose in an unlooked-for quarter. The Giants, those hideous
  monsters (some with legs formed of serpents) who had sprung from the
  earth and the blood of Uranus, declared war against the triumphant
  deities of Olympus, and a struggle ensued, which, in consequence of Gæa
  having made these children of hers invincible as long as they kept their
  feet on the ground, was wearisome and protracted. Their mother's
  precaution, however, was rendered unavailing by pieces of rock being
  hurled upon them, which threw them down, and their feet being no longer
  placed firmly on their mother-earth, they were overcome, and this tedious
  war (which was called the Gigantomachia) at last came to an end. Among
  the most daring of these earth-born giants were Enceladus, Rh       tus,
  and the valiant Mimas, who, with youthful fire and energy, hurled against
  heaven great masses of rock and burning oak-trees, and defied the
  lightnings of Zeus. One of the most powerful monsters who opposed Zeus in
  this  a
  name="page21">[21]war was called Typhon or Typh       us. He
  was the youngest son of Tartarus and Gæa, and had a hundred heads, with
  eyes which struck terror to the beholders, and awe-inspiring voices
  frightful to hear. This dreadful monster resolved to conquer both gods
  and men, but his plans were at length defeated by Zeus, who, after a
  violent encounter, succeeded in destroying him with a thunderbolt, but
  not before he had so terrified the gods that they had fled for refuge to
  Egypt, where they metamorphosed themselves into different animals and
  thus escaped.



THEORIES AS TO THE ORIGIN OF MAN.

  Just as there were several theories concerning the origin of the
  world, so there were various accounts of the creation of man.

  The first natural belief of the Greek people was that man had sprung
  from the earth. They saw the tender plants and flowers force their way
  through the ground in the early spring of the year after the frost of
  winter had disappeared, and so they naturally concluded that man must
  also have issued from the earth in a similar manner. Like the wild plants
  and flowers, he was supposed to have had no cultivation, and resembled in
  his habits the untamed beasts of the field, having no habitation except
  that which nature had provided in the holes of the rocks, and in the
  dense forests whose overarching boughs protected him from the inclemency
  of the weather.

  In the course of time these primitive human beings became tamed and
  civilized by the gods and heroes, who taught them to work in metals, to
  build houses, and other useful arts of civilization. But the human race
  became in the course of time so degenerate that the gods resolved to
  destroy all mankind by means of a flood; Deucalion  span
  class="pagenum">[22](son of Prometheus) and
  his wife Pyrrha, being, on account of their piety, the only mortals
  saved.

  By the command of his father, Deucalion built a ship, in which he and
  his wife took refuge during the deluge, which lasted for nine days. When
  the waters abated the ship rested on Mount Othrys in Thessaly, or
  according to some on Mount Parnassus. Deucalion and his wife now
  consulted the oracle of Themis as to how the human race might be
  restored. The answer was, that they were to cover their heads, and throw
  the bones of their mother behind them. For some time they were perplexed
  as to the meaning of the oracular command, but at length both agreed that
  by the bones of their mother were meant the stones of the earth. They
  accordingly took up stones from the mountain side and cast them over
  their shoulders. From those thrown by Deucalion there sprang up men, and
  from those thrown by Pyrrha, women.

  After the lapse of time the theory of Autochthony (from autos,
  self, and chthon, earth) was laid aside. When this belief existed
  there were no religious teachers whatever; but in course of time temples
  were raised in honour of the different gods, and priests appointed to
  offer sacrifices to them and conduct their worship. These priests were
  looked upon as authorities in all religious matters, and the doctrine
  they taught was, that man had been created by the gods, and that there
  had been several successive ages of men, which were called the Golden,
  Silver, Brazen, and Iron Ages.

  Life in the Golden Age was one unceasing round of ever-recurring
  pleasures unmarred by sorrow or care. The favoured mortals living at this
  happy time led pure and joyous lives, thinking no evil, and doing no
  wrong. The earth brought forth fruits and flowers without toil or labour
  in plentiful luxuriance, and war was unknown. This delightful and
  god-like existence lasted for hundreds of years, and when at length life
  on earth was ended, death laid his hand so gently upon them that they
  passed painlessly away in a happy dream, and continued their existence as
  ministering spirits in Hades, watching over and  span
  class="pagenum">[23]protecting those they had
  loved and left behind on earth. The men of the Silver Age a name="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7">[7] were a long time growing up, and during
  their childhood, which lasted a hundred years, they suffered from
  ill-health and extreme debility. When they at last became men they lived
  but a short time, for they would not abstain from mutual injury, nor pay
  the service due to the gods, and were therefore banished to Hades. There,
  unlike the beings of the Golden Age, they exercised no beneficent
  supervision over the dear ones left behind, but wandered about as
  restless spirits, always sighing for the lost pleasures they had enjoyed
  in life.

  The men of the Brazen Age were quite a different race of beings, being
  as strong and powerful as those of the Silver Age were weak and
  enervated. Everything which surrounded them was of brass; their arms,
  their tools, their dwellings, and all that they made. Their characters
  seem to have resembled the metal in which they delighted; their minds and
  hearts were hard, obdurate, and cruel. They led a life of strife and
  contention, introduced into the world, which had hitherto known nothing
  but peace and tranquillity, the scourge of war, and were in fact only
  happy when fighting and quarrelling with each other. Hitherto Themis, the
  goddess of Justice, had been living among mankind, but becoming
  disheartened at their evil doings, she abandoned the earth, and winged
  her flight back to heaven. At last the gods became so tired of their evil
  deeds and continual dissensions, that they removed them from the face of
  the earth, and sent them down to Hades to share the fate of their
  predecessors.

  We now come to the men of the Iron Age. The earth, no longer teeming
  with fruitfulness, only yielded her increase after much toil and labour.
  The goddess of Justice having abandoned mankind, no influence remained
  sufficiently powerful to preserve them from every kind of wickedness and
  sin. This condition grew worse as time went on, until at last Zeus in his
  anger let loose the water-courses from above, and drowned every  !-- Page
  24 -->[24]individual of
  this evil race, except Deucalion and Pyrrha.

  The theory of Hesiod,[8]
  the oldest of all the Greek poets, was that the Titan Prometheus, the son
  of Iapetus, had formed man out of clay, and that Athene had breathed a
  soul into him. Full of love for the beings he had called into existence,
  Prometheus determined to elevate their minds and improve their condition
  in every way; he therefore taught them astronomy, mathematics, the
  alphabet, how to cure diseases, and the art of divination. He created
  this race in such great numbers that the gods began to see the necessity
  of instituting certain fixed laws with regard to the sacrifices due to
  them, and the worship to which they considered themselves entitled from
  mankind in return for the protection which they accorded them. An
  assembly was therefore convened at Mecone in order to settle these
  points. It was decided that Prometheus, as the advocate of man, should
  slay an ox, which should be divided into two equal parts, and that the
  gods should select one portion which should henceforth, in all future
  sacrifices, be set apart for them. Prometheus so divided the ox that one
  part consisted of the bones (which formed of course the least valuable
  portion of the animal), artfully concealed by the white fat; whilst the
  other contained all the edible parts, which he covered with the skin, and
  on the top of all he laid the stomach.

  Zeus, pretending to be deceived, chose the heap of bones, but he saw
  through the stratagem, and was so angry at the deception practised on him
  by Prometheus that he avenged himself by refusing to mortals the gift of
  fire.  a
  name="page25">[25]Prometheus, however, resolved to brave the
  anger of the great ruler of Olympus, and to obtain from heaven the vital
  spark so necessary for the further progress and comfort of the human
  race. He accordingly contrived to steal some sparks from the chariot of
  the sun, which he conveyed to earth hidden in a hollow tube. Furious at
  being again outwitted, Zeus determined to be revenged first on mankind,
  and then on Prometheus. To punish the former he commanded Hephæstus
  (Vulcan) to mould a beautiful woman out of clay, and determined that
  through her instrumentality trouble and misery should be brought into the
  world.

  The gods were so charmed with the graceful and artistic creation of
  Hephæstus, that they all determined to endow her with some special gift.
  Hermes (Mercury) bestowed on her a smooth persuasive tongue, Aphrodite
  gave her beauty and the art of pleasing; the Graces made her fascinating,
  and Athene (Minerva) gifted her with the possession of feminine
  accomplishments. She was called Pandora, which means all-gifted, having
  received every attribute necessary to make her charming and irresistible.
  Thus beautifully formed and endowed, this exquisite creature, attired by
  the Graces, and crowned with flowers by the Seasons, was conducted to the
  house of Epimetheus[9] by
  Hermes the messenger of the gods. Now Epimetheus had been warned by his
  brother not to accept any gift whatever from the gods; but he was so
  fascinated by the beautiful being who suddenly appeared before him, that
  he welcomed her to his home, and made her his wife. It was not long,
  however, before he had cause to regret his weakness.

  He had in his possession a jar of rare workmanship, containing all the
  blessings reserved by the gods for mankind, which he had been expressly
  forbidden to open. But woman's proverbial curiosity could not withstand
  so great a temptation, and Pandora determined to solve the mystery at any
  cost. Watching her opportunity she raised the lid, and immediately all
  the blessings which  a
  name="page26">[26]the gods had thus reserved for mankind took
  wing and flew away. But all was not lost. Just as Hope (which lay at the
  bottom) was about to escape, Pandora hastily closed the lid of the jar,
  and thus preserved to man that never-failing solace which helps him to
  bear with courage the many ills which assail him. a name="NtA_10"
  href="#Nt_10">[10]

  Having punished mankind, Zeus determined to execute vengeance on
  Prometheus. He accordingly chained him to a rock in Mount Caucasus, and
  sent an eagle every day to gnaw away his liver, which grew again every
  night ready for fresh torments. For thirty years Prometheus endured this
  fearful punishment; but at length Zeus relented, and permitted his son
  Heracles (Hercules) to kill the eagle, and the sufferer was released.



THIRD DYNASTY       OLYMPIAN DIVINITIES.

ZEUS[11] (Jupiter).

  Zeus, the great presiding deity of the universe, the ruler of heaven
  and earth, was regarded by the Greeks, first, as the god of all aërial
  phenomena; secondly, as the personification of the laws of nature;
  thirdly, as lord of state-life; and fourthly, as the father of gods and
  men.

  As the god of aërial phenomena he could, by shaking his ægis, a
  name="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12">[12] produce storms, tempests,
  and intense darkness. At his command the mighty thunder rolls, the
  lightning flashes, and the clouds open and pour forth their refreshing
  streams to fructify the earth.

  As the personification of the operations of nature, he represents
  those grand laws of unchanging and harmonious order, by which not only
  the physical but also  a
  name="page27">[27]the moral world is governed. Hence he is the
  god of regulated time as marked by the changing seasons, and by the
  regular succession of day and night, in contradistinction to his father
  Cronus, who represents time absolutely, i.e. eternity.

  As the lord of state-life, he is the founder of kingly power, the
  upholder of all institutions connected with the state, and the special
  friend and patron of princes, whom he guards and assists with his advice
  and counsel. He protects the assembly of the people, and, in fact,
  watches over the welfare of the whole community.

  As the father of the gods, Zeus sees that each deity performs his or
  her individual duty, punishes their misdeeds, settles their disputes, and
  acts towards them on all occasions as their all-knowing counsellor and
  mighty friend.

  As the father of men, he takes a paternal interest in the actions and
  well-being of mortals. He watches over them with tender solicitude,
  rewarding truth, charity, and uprightness, but severely punishing
  perjury, cruelty, and want of hospitality. Even the poorest and most
  forlorn wanderer finds in him a powerful advocate, for he, by a wise and
  merciful dispensation, ordains that the mighty ones of the earth should
  succour their distressed and needy brethren.

  The Greeks believed that the home of this their mighty and
  all-powerful deity was on the top of Mount Olympus, that high and lofty
  mountain between Thessaly and Macedon, whose summit, wrapt in clouds and
  mist, was hidden from mortal view. It was supposed that this mysterious
  region, which even a bird could not reach, extended beyond the clouds
  right into Aether, the realm of the immortal gods. The poets describe
  this ethereal atmosphere as bright, glistening, and refreshing,
  exercising a peculiar, gladdening influence over the minds and hearts of
  those privileged beings permitted to share its delights. Here youth never
  ages, and the passing years leave no traces on its favoured inhabitants.
  On the cloud-capped summit of Olympus was the palace of  !-- Page 28
  -->[28]Zeus and Hera,
  of burnished gold, chased silver, and gleaming ivory. Lower down were the
  homes of the other gods, which, though less commanding in position and
  size, were yet similar to that of Zeus in design and workmanship, all
  being the work of the divine artist Hephæstus. Below these were other
  palaces of silver, ebony, ivory, or burnished brass, where the Heroes, or
  Demi-gods, resided.

  As the worship of Zeus formed so important a feature in the religion
  of the Greeks, his statues were necessarily both numerous and
  magnificent. He is usually represented as a man of noble and imposing
  mien, his countenance expressing all the lofty majesty of the omnipotent
  ruler of the universe, combined with the gracious, yet serious, benignity
  of the father and friend of mankind. He may be recognized by his rich
  flowing beard, and the thick masses of hair, which rise straight from the
  high and intellectual forehead and fall to his shoulders in clustering
  locks. The nose is large and finely formed, and the slightly-opened lips
  impart an air of sympathetic kindliness which invites confidence. He is
  always accompanied by an eagle, which either surmounts his sceptre, or
  sits at his feet; he generally bears in his uplifted hand a sheaf of
  thunder-bolts, just ready to be hurled, whilst in the other he holds the
  lightning. The head is frequently encircled with a wreath of
  oak-leaves.

  The most celebrated statue of the Olympian Zeus was that by the famous
  Athenian sculptor Phidias, which was forty feet high, and stood in the
  temple of Zeus at Olympia. It was formed of ivory and gold, and was  !--
  Page 29 -->[29]such a
  masterpiece of art, that it was reckoned among the seven wonders of the
  world. It represented the god, seated on a throne, holding in his right
  hand a life-sized image of Nike (the goddess of Victory), and in his left
  a royal sceptre, surmounted by an eagle. It is said that the great
  sculptor had concentrated all the marvellous powers of his genius on this
  sublime conception, and earnestly entreated Zeus to give him a decided
  proof that his labours were approved. An answer to his prayer came
  through the open roof of the temple in the shape of a flash of lightning,
  which Phidias interpreted as a sign that the god of heaven was pleased
  with his work.

  Zeus was first worshipped at Dodona in Epirus, where, at the foot of
  Mount Tomarus, on the woody shore of Lake Joanina, was his famous oracle,
  the most ancient in Greece. Here the voice of the eternal and invisible
  god was supposed to be heard in the rustling leaves of a giant oak,
  announcing to mankind the will of heaven and the destiny of mortals;
  these revelations being interpreted to the people by the priests of Zeus,
  who were called Selli. Recent excavations which have been made at this
  spot have brought to light the ruins of the ancient temple of Zeus, and
  also, among other interesting relics, some plates of lead, on which are
  engraved inquiries which were evidently made by certain individuals who
  consulted the oracle. These little leaden plates speak to us, as it were,
  in a curiously homely manner of a by-gone time in the buried past. One
  person inquires what god he should apply to for health and fortune;
  another asks for advice concerning his child; and a third, evidently a
  shepherd, promises a gift to the oracle should a speculation in sheep
  turn out successfully. Had these little memorials been of gold instead of
  lead, they would doubtless have shared the fate of the numerous treasures
  which adorned this and other temples, in the universal pillage which took
  place when Greece fell into the hands of barbarians.

  Though Dodona was the most ancient of his shrines, the great national
  seat of the worship of Zeus was at Olympia in Elis, where there was a
  magnificent temple  a
  name="page30">[30]dedicated to him, containing the famous
  colossal statue by Phidias above described. Crowds of devout worshippers
  flocked to this world-renowned fane from all parts of Greece, not only to
  pay homage to their supreme deity, but also to join in the celebrated
  games which were held there at intervals of four years. The Olympic games
  were such a thoroughly national institution, that even Greeks who had
  left their native country made a point of returning on these occasions,
  if possible, in order to contend with their fellow-countrymen in the
  various athletic sports which took place at these festivals.

  It will be seen on reflection that in a country like Greece, which
  contained so many petty states, often at variance with each other, these
  national gatherings must have been most valuable as a means of uniting
  the Greeks in one great bond of brotherhood. On these festive occasions
  the whole nation met together, forgetting for the moment all past
  differences, and uniting in the enjoyment of the same festivities.

  It will doubtless have been remarked that in the representations of
  Zeus he is always accompanied by an eagle. This royal bird was sacred to
  him, probably from the fact of its being the only creature capable of
  gazing at the sun without being dazzled, which may have suggested the
  idea that it was able to contemplate the splendour of divine majesty
  unshrinkingly.

  The oak-tree, and also the summits of mountains, were sacred to Zeus.
  His sacrifices consisted of white bulls, cows, and goats.

  Zeus had seven immortal wives, whose names were Metis, Themis,
  Eurynome, Demeter, Mnemosyne, Leto, and Hera.

  METIS, his first wife, was one of the Oceanides or sea-nymphs.
  She was the personification of prudence and wisdom, a convincing proof of
  which she displayed in her successful administration of the potion which
  caused Cronus to yield up his children. She was endowed with the gift of
  prophecy, and foretold to Zeus that one of their children would gain
  ascendency over  a
  name="page31">[31]him. In order, therefore, to avert the
  possibility of the prediction being fulfilled he swallowed her before any
  children were born to them. Feeling afterwards violent pains in his head,
  he sent for Hephæstus, and ordered him to open it with an axe. His
  command was obeyed, and out sprang, with a loud and martial shout, a
  beautiful being, clad in armour from head to foot. This was Athene
  (Minerva), goddess of Armed Resistance and Wisdom.

  THEMIS was the goddess of Justice, Law, and Order.

  EURYNOME was one of the Oceanides, and the mother of the
  Charites or Graces.

  DEMETER,[13] the
  daughter of Cronus and Rhea, was the goddess of Agriculture.

  MNEMOSYNE, the daughter of Uranus and Gæa, was the goddess of
  Memory and the mother of the nine Muses.

  LETO (Latona) was the daughter of C       us and Ph       be.
  She was gifted with wonderful beauty, and was tenderly loved by Zeus, but
  her lot was far from being a happy one, for Hera, being extremely jealous
  of her, persecuted her with inveterate cruelty, and sent the dreadful
  serpent Python[14] to
  terrify and torment her wherever she went. But Zeus, who had observed
  with the deepest compassion her weary wanderings and agonized fears,
  resolved to create for her some place of refuge, however humble, where
  she might feel herself safe from the venomous attacks of the serpent. He
  therefore brought her to Delos, a floating island in the Ægean Sea, which
  he made stationary by attaching it with chains of adamant to the bottom
  of the sea. Here she gave birth to her twin-children, Apollo and Artemis
  (Diana), two of the most beautiful of the immortals.

  According to some versions of the story of Leto, Zeus transformed her
  into a quail, in order that she might thus elude the vigilance of Hera,
  and she is said to have  a
  name="page32">[32]resumed her true form when she arrived at
  the island of Delos.

  HERA, being the principal wife of Zeus and queen of heaven, a
  detailed account will be given of her in a special chapter.

  In the union of Zeus with most of his immortal wives we shall find
  that an allegorical meaning is conveyed. His marriage with Metis, who is
  said to have surpassed both gods and men in knowledge, represents supreme
  power allied to wisdom and prudence. His union with Themis typifies the
  bond which exists between divine majesty and justice, law, and order.
  Eurynome, as the mother of the Charites or Graces, supplied the refining
  and harmonizing influences of grace and beauty, whilst the marriage of
  Zeus with Mnemosyne typifies the union of genius with memory.



  In addition to the seven immortal wives of Zeus, he was also allied to
  a number of mortal maidens whom he visited under various disguises, as it
  was supposed that if he revealed himself in his true form as king of
  heaven the splendour of his glory would cause instant destruction to
  mortals. The mortal consorts of Zeus have been such a favourite theme
  with poets, painters, and sculptors, that it is necessary to give some
  account of their individual history. Those best known are Antiope, Leda,
  Europa, Callisto, Alcmene, Semele, Io, and Danae.

  ANTIOPE, to whom Zeus appeared under the form of a satyr, was
  the daughter of Nicteus, king of Thebes. To escape the anger of her
  father she fled to Sicyon, where king Epopeus, enraptured with her
  wonderful beauty, made her his wife without asking her father's consent.
  This so enraged Nicteus that he declared war against Epopeus, in order to
  compel him to restore Antiope. At his death, which took place before he
  could succeed in his purpose, Nicteus left his kingdom to his brother
  Lycus, commanding him, at the same time, to carry on the war, and execute
  his vengeance. Lycus invaded Sicyon, defeated and killed Epopeus, and
  brought back  a
  name="page33">[33]Antiope as a prisoner. On the way to Thebes
  she gave birth to her twin-sons, Amphion and Zethus, who, by the orders
  of Lycus, were at once exposed on Mount Cithaeron, and would have
  perished but for the kindness of a shepherd, who took pity on them and
  preserved their lives. Antiope was, for many years, held captive by her
  uncle Lycus, and compelled to suffer the utmost cruelty at the hands of
  his wife Dirce. But one day her bonds were miraculously loosened, and she
  flew for shelter and protection to the humble dwelling of her sons on
  Mount Cithaeron. During the long period of their mother's captivity the
  babes had grown into sturdy youths, and, as they listened angrily to the
  story of her wrongs, they became all impatience to avenge them. Setting
  off at once to Thebes they succeeded in possessing themselves of the
  town, and after slaying the cruel Lycus they bound Dirce by the hair to
  the horns of a wild bull, which dragged her hither and thither until she
  expired. Her mangled body was cast into the fount near Thebes, which
  still bears her name. Amphion became king of Thebes in his uncle's stead.
  He was a friend of the Muses, and devoted to music and poetry. His
  brother, Zethus, was famous for his skill in archery, and was
  passionately fond of the chase. It is said that when Amphion wished to
  inclose the town of Thebes with walls and towers, he had but to play a
  sweet melody on the lyre, given to him by Hermes, and the huge stones
  began to move, and obediently fitted themselves together.

  The punishment of Dirce at the hands of Amphion and Zethus forms the
  subject of the world-renowned marble group in the museum at Naples, known
  by the name of the Farnese Bull.

  In sculpture Amphion is always represented with a lyre; Zethus with a
  club.

  LEDA, whose affections Zeus won under the form of a swan, was
  the daughter of Thestius, king of Ætolia. Her twin-sons, Castor and
  (Polydeuces or) Pollux,[15]
  were  a
  name="page34">[34]renowned for their tender attachment to each
  other. They were also famous for their physical accomplishments, Castor
  being the most expert charioteer of his day, and Pollux the first of
  pugilists. Their names appear both among the hunters of the Calydonian
  boar-hunt and the heroes of the Argonautic expedition. The brothers
  became attached to the daughters of Leucippus, prince of the Messenians,
  who had been betrothed by their father to Idas and Lynceus, sons of
  Aphareus. Having persuaded Leucippus to break his promise, the twins
  carried off the maidens as their brides. Idas and Lynceus, naturally
  furious at this proceeding, challenged the Dioscuri to mortal combat, in
  which Castor perished by the hand of Idas, and Lynceus by that of Pollux.
  Zeus wished to confer the gift of immortality upon Pollux, but he refused
  to accept it unless allowed to share it with Castor. Zeus gave the
  desired permission, and the faithful brothers were both allowed to live,
  but only on alternate days. The Dioscuri received divine honours
  throughout Greece, and were worshipped with special reverence at
  Sparta.

  EUROPA was the beautiful daughter of Agenor, king of
  Ph       nicia. She was one day gathering flowers with her companions in
  a meadow near the sea-shore, when Zeus, charmed with her great beauty,
  and wishing to win her love, transformed himself into a beautiful white
  bull, and trotted quietly up to the princess, so as not to alarm her.
  Surprised at the gentleness of the animal, and admiring its beauty, as it
  lay placidly on the grass, she caressed it, crowned it with flowers, and,
  at last, playfully seated herself on its back. Hardly had she done so
  than the disguised god bounded away with his lovely burden, and swam
  across the sea with her to the island of Crete.

  Europa was the mother of Minos, Aeacus, and Rhadamanthus. Minos, who
  became king of Crete, was celebrated for his justice and moderation, and
  after death he was created one of the judges of the lower world, which
  office he held in conjunction with his brothers.  span
  class="pagenum">[35]

  CALLISTO, the daughter of Lycaon, king of Arcadia, was a
  huntress in the train of Artemis, devoted to the pleasures of the chase,
  who had made a vow never to marry; but Zeus, under the form of the
  huntress-goddess, succeeded in obtaining her affections. Hera, being
  extremely jealous of her, changed her into a bear, and caused Artemis
  (who failed to recognize her attendant under this form) to hunt her in
  the chase, and put an end to her existence. After her death she was
  placed by Zeus among the stars as a constellation, under the name of
  Arctos, or the bear.

  ALCMENE, the daughter of Electryon, king of Mycenae, was
  betrothed to her cousin Amphytrion; but, during his absence on a perilous
  undertaking, Zeus assumed his form, and obtained her affections. Heracles
  (whose world-renowned exploits will be related among the legends) was the
  son of Alcmene and Zeus.

  SEMELE, a beautiful princess, the daughter of Cadmus, king of
  Ph       nicia, was greatly beloved by Zeus. Like the unfortunate
  Callisto, she was hated by Hera with jealous malignity, and the haughty
  queen of heaven determined to effect her destruction. Disguising herself,
  therefore, as Ber       , Semele's faithful old nurse, she artfully
  persuaded her to insist upon Zeus visiting her, as he appeared to Hera,
  in all his power and glory, well knowing that this would cause her
  instant death. Semele, suspecting no treachery, followed the advice of
  her supposed nurse; and the next time Zeus came to her, she earnestly
  entreated him to grant the favour she was about to ask. Zeus swore by the
  Styx (which was to the gods an irrevocable oath) to accede to her request
  whatsoever it might be. Semele, therefore, secure of gaining her
  petition, begged of Zeus to appear to her in all the glory of his divine
  power and majesty. As he had sworn to grant whatever she asked of him, he
  was compelled to comply with her wish; he therefore revealed himself as
  the mighty lord of the universe, accompanied by thunder and lightning,
  and she was instantly consumed in the flames.  span
  class="pagenum">[36]

  IO, daughter of Inachus, king of Argos, was a priestess of
  Hera. She was very beautiful, and Zeus, who was much attached to her,
  transformed her into a white cow, in order to defeat the jealous
  intrigues of Hera, who, however, was not to be deceived. Aware of the
  stratagem, she contrived to obtain the animal from Zeus, and placed her
  under the watchful care of a man called Argus-Panoptes, who fastened her
  to an olive-tree in the grove of Hera. He had a hundred eyes, of which,
  when asleep, he never closed more than two at a time; being thus always
  on the watch, Hera found him extremely useful in keeping guard over Io.
  Hermes, however, by the command of Zeus, succeeded in putting all his
  eyes to sleep with the sound of his magic lyre, and then, taking
  advantage of his helpless condition, slew him. The story goes, that in
  commemoration of the services which Argus had rendered her, Hera placed
  his eyes on the tail of a peacock, as a lasting memorial of her
  gratitude. Ever fertile in resource, Hera now sent a gadfly to worry and
  torment the unfortunate Io incessantly, and she wandered all over the
  world in hopes of escaping from her tormentor. At length she reached
  Egypt, where she found rest and freedom from the persecutions of her
  enemy. On the banks of the Nile she resumed her original form and gave
  birth to a son called Epaphus, who afterwards became king of Egypt, and
  built the famous city of Memphis.

  DANAE.       Zeus appeared to Danae under the form of a shower
  of gold. (Further details concerning her will be found in the legend of
  Perseus.)



  The Greeks supposed that the divine ruler of the Universe occasionally
  assumed a human form, and descended from his celestial abode, in order to
  visit mankind and observe their proceedings, his aim being generally
  either to punish the guilty, or to reward the deserving.

  On one occasion Zeus, accompanied by Hermes, made a journey through
  Phrygia, seeking hospitality and shelter wherever they went. But nowhere
  did they receive a  a
  name="page37">[37]kindly welcome till they came to the humble
  cottage of an old man and his wife called Philemon and Baucis, who
  entertained them with the greatest kindness, setting before them what
  frugal fare their humble means permitted, and bidding them welcome with
  unaffected cordiality. Observing in the course of their simple repast
  that the wine bowl was miraculously replenished, the aged couple became
  convinced of the divine nature of their guests. The gods now informed
  them that on account of its wickedness their native place was doomed to
  destruction, and told them to climb the neighbouring hill with them,
  which overlooked the village where they dwelt. What was their dismay on
  beholding at their feet, in place of the spot where they had passed so
  many happy years together, nothing but a watery plain, the only house to
  be seen being their own little cottage, which suddenly changed itself
  into a temple before their eyes. Zeus now asked the worthy pair to name
  any wish they particularly desired and it should be granted. They
  accordingly begged that they might serve the gods in the temple below,
  and end life together.

  Their wish was granted, for, after spending the remainder of their
  lives in the worship of the gods, they both died at the same instant, and
  were transformed by Zeus into trees, remaining for ever side by side.

  Upon another occasion Zeus, wishing to ascertain for himself the truth
  of the reports concerning the atrocious wickedness of mankind, made a
  journey through Arcadia. Being recognized by the Arcadians as king of
  heaven, he was received by them with becoming respect and veneration; but
  Lycaon, their king, who had rendered himself infamous by the gross
  impiety of himself and his sons, doubted the divinity of Zeus, ridiculed
  his people for being so easily duped, and, according to his custom of
  killing all strangers who ventured to trust his hospitality, resolved to
  murder him. Before executing this wicked design, however, he decided to
  put Zeus to the test, and having killed a boy for the purpose, placed
  before him a dish containing human flesh. But Zeus was  !-- Page 38
  -->[38]not to be
  deceived. He beheld the revolting dish with horror and loathing, and
  angrily upsetting the table upon which it was placed, turned Lycaon into
  a wolf, and destroyed all his fifty sons by lightning, except Nyctimus,
  who was saved by the intervention of Gæa.

JUPITER.

  The Roman Jupiter, who is so frequently confounded with the Greek
  Zeus, is identical with him only as being the head of the Olympic gods,
  and the presiding deity over Life, Light, and Aërial Phenomena. Jupiter
  is lord of life in its widest and most comprehensive signification,
  having absolute power over life and death, in which respect he differed
  from the Greek Zeus, who was to a certain extent controlled by the
  all-potent sway of the Moiræ or Fates. Zeus, as we have seen, often
  condescends to visit mankind, either as a mortal, or under various
  disguises, whereas Jupiter always remains essentially the supreme god of
  heaven, and never appears upon earth.

  The most celebrated temple of Jupiter was that on the Capitoline Hill
  in the city of Rome, where he was worshipped under the names of
  Jupiter-Optimus-Maximus, Capitolinus, and Tarpeius.

  The Romans represented him seated on a throne of ivory, holding in his
  right hand a sheaf of thunderbolts, and in his left a sceptre, whilst an
  eagle stands beside his throne.

HERA (Juno).

  Hera, the eldest daughter of Cronus and Rhea, was born at Samos, or,
  according to some accounts, at Argos, and was reared by the
  sea-divinities Oceanus and Tethys, who were models of conjugal
  fidelity.[16] She was the
   a
  name="page39">[39]principal wife of Zeus, and, as queen of
  heaven, participated in the honours paid to him, but her dominion only
  extended over the air (the lower aërial regions). Hera appears to be the
  sublime embodiment of strict matronly virtue, and is on that account the
  protectress of purity and married women. Faultless herself in her
  fidelity as a wife, she is essentially the type of the sanctity of the
  marriage tie, and holds in abhorrence any violation of its obligations.
  So strongly was she imbued with this hatred of any immorality, that,
  finding herself so often called upon to punish the failings of both gods
  and men in this respect, she became jealous, harsh, and vindictive. Her
  exalted position as the wife of the supreme deity, combined with her
  extreme beauty, caused her to become exceedingly vain, and she
  consequently resented with great severity any infringement on her rights
  as queen of heaven, or any apparent slight on her personal
  appearance.

  The following story will signally illustrate how ready she was to
  resent any slight offered to her.

  At the marriage of the sea-nymph Thetis with a mortal called Peleus,
  all the gods and goddesses were present, except Eris (the goddess of
  Discord). Indignant at not being invited, she determined to cause
  dissension in the assembly, and for this purpose threw into the midst of
  the guests a golden apple with the inscription on it "For the Fairest."
  Now, as all the goddesses were extremely beautiful, each claimed the
  apple; but at length, the rest having relinquished their pretensions, the
  number of candidates was reduced to three, Hera, Athene, and Aphrodite,
  who agreed to appeal to Paris for a settlement of this delicate question,
  he being noted for the wisdom he had displayed in his judgment upon
  several occasions. Paris was the son of Priam, king of Troy, who,
  ignorant of his noble birth, was at this time feeding his flocks on Mount
  Ida, in Phrygia. Hermes, as messenger of the gods, conducted the three
  rival beauties to the young shepherd, and with breathless anxiety they
  awaited his decision. Each fair candidate endeavoured  !-- Page 40
  -->[40]to secure his
  favour by the most tempting offers. Hera promised him extensive
  dominions; Athene, martial fame and glory; and Aphrodite, the loveliest
  woman in the world. But whether he really considered Aphrodite the
  fairest of the three, or preferred a beautiful wife to fame and power, we
  cannot tell; all we know is that to her he awarded the golden apple, and
  she became ever after universally acknowledged as the goddess of beauty.
  Hera, having fully expected that Paris would give her the preference, was
  so indignant that she never forgave him, and not only persecuted him, but
  all the family of Priam, whose dreadful sufferings and misfortunes during
  the Trojan war were attributed to her influence. In fact, she carried her
  animosity to such an extent that it was often the cause of domestic
  disagreements between herself and Zeus, who espoused the cause of the
  Trojans.

  Among the many stories of these frequent quarrels there is one
  connected with Heracles, the favourite son of Zeus, which is as
  follows:       Hera having raised a storm at sea in order to drive him
  out of his course, Zeus became so angry that he hung her in the clouds by
  a golden chain, and attached heavy anvils to her feet. Her son Hephæstus
  tried to release his mother from her humiliating position, for which Zeus
  threw him out of heaven, and his leg was broken by the fall.

  Hera, being deeply offended with Zeus, determined to separate herself
  from him for ever, and she accordingly left him and took up her abode in
  Eub       a. Surprised and grieved at this unlooked-for desertion, Zeus
  resolved to leave no means untried to win her back again. In this
  emergency he consulted Cithaeron, king of Platea, who was famed for his
  great wisdom and subtlety. Cithaeron advised him to dress up an image in
  bridal attire and place it in a chariot, announcing that this was Platea,
  his future wife. The artifice succeeded. Hera, incensed at the idea of a
  rival, flew to meet the procession in great anger, and seizing the
  supposed bride, she furiously attacked her and dragged off her nuptial
  attire. Her delight on discovering the deception was so great that a  !--
  Page 41 --> a
  name="page41">[41]reconciliation took place, and, committing
  the image to the flames, with joyful laughter she seated herself in its
  place and returned to Olympus.

  Hera was the mother of Ares (Mars), Hephæstus, Hebe, and Eileithyia.
  Ares was the god of War; Hephæstus, of Fire; Hebe, of Youth; and
  Eileithyia presided over the birth of mortals.

  Hera dearly loved Greece, and indeed always watched over and protected
  Greek interests, her beloved and favourite cities being Argos, Samos,
  Sparta, and Mycenæ.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0041-1.png"
      alt="Hera" title="Hera" />
  
  Her principal temples were at Argos and Samos. From a remote period
  she was greatly venerated at Olympia, and her temple there, which stood
  in the Altis or sacred grove, was five hundred years older than that of
  Zeus on the same spot. Some interesting excavations which are now going
  on there have brought to light the remains of the ancient edifice, which
  contains among other treasures of antiquity several beautiful statues,
  the work of the famous sculptors of ancient Greece. At first this temple
  was built of wood, then of stone, and the one lately discovered was
  formed of conglomerate of shells.

  In the Altis races were run by young maidens in honour of Hera, and
  the fleetest of foot received in token of her victory an olive-wreath and
  a piece of the flesh of the sacrifices. These races, like the Olympic
  Games, were celebrated at intervals of four years, and were called Heræ.
  A beautiful robe, woven by sixteen women chosen from the sixteen cities
  of Elis, was always offered to Hera on these  span
  class="pagenum">[42]occasions, and choral
  songs and sacred dances formed part of the ceremonies.

  Hera is usually represented seated on a throne, holding a pomegranate
  in one hand and a sceptre surmounted by a cuckoo in the other. She
  appears as a calm, dignified matron of majestic beauty, robed in a tunic
  and mantle, her forehead is broad and intellectual, her eyes large and
  fully opened, and her arms dazzlingly white and finely moulded.

  The finest statue of this divinity was that by Polycletus at
  Argos.

  Her attributes are the diadem, veil, sceptre, and peacock.

  The first day of every month a ewe-lamb and sow were sacrificed to
  Hera. The hawk, goose, and more particularly the peacock a name="NtA_17"
  href="#Nt_17">[17] were sacred to her. Flocks of these
  beautiful birds generally surround her throne and draw her chariot, Iris,
  the Rainbow, being seated behind her.

  Her favourite flowers were the dittany, poppy, and lily.

JUNO.

  Juno, the Roman divinity supposed to be identical with the Greek Hera,
  differed from her in the most salient points, for whereas Hera invariably
  appears as the haughty, unbending queen of heaven, Juno, on the other
  hand, is revered and beloved as the type of a matron and housewife. She
  was worshipped in Rome under various titles, most of which point to her
  vocation as the protectress of married women. Juno was believed to watch
  over and guard the life of every woman from her birth to her death. The
  principal temples dedicated to her were in Rome, one being erected on the
  Aventine, and the other on the Capitoline Hill. She had also a temple on
  the Arx, in which she was worshipped as Juno Moneta, or the  !-- Page 43
  -->[43]warning goddess.
  Adjacent to this shrine was the public mint. a name="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18">[18] On the 1st of March a grand annual
  festival, called the Matronalia, was celebrated in her honour by all the
  married women of Rome, and this religious institution was accompanied
  with much solemnity. a name="NtA_19"
  href="#Nt_19">[19]

PALLAS-ATHENE (Minerva).

  Pallas-Athene, goddess of Wisdom and Armed Resistance, was a purely
  Greek divinity; that is to say, no other nation possessed a corresponding
  conception. She was supposed, as already related, to have issued from the
  head of Zeus himself, clad in armour from head to foot. The miraculous
  advent of this maiden goddess is beautifully described by Homer in one of
  his hymns: snow-capped Olympus shook to its foundation; the glad earth
  re-echoed her martial shout; the billowy sea became agitated; and Helios,
  the sun-god, arrested his fiery steeds in their headlong course to
  welcome this wonderful emanation from the godhead. Athene was at once
  admitted into the assembly of the gods, and henceforth took her place as
  the most faithful and sagacious of all her father's counsellors. This
  brave, dauntless maiden, so exactly the essence of all that is noble in
  the character of "the father of gods and men," remained throughout chaste
  in word and deed, and kind at heart, without exhibiting any of those
  failings which somewhat mar the nobler features in the character of Zeus.
  This direct emanation from his own self, justly his favourite child, his
  better and purer counterpart, received from him several important
  prerogatives. She was permitted to hurl the thunderbolts, to prolong the
  life of man, and to bestow the gift of prophecy; in fact Athene was the
  only divinity whose authority was equal to that of Zeus himself, and when
  he had ceased to visit the earth in person  span
  class="pagenum">[44]she was empowered by him
  to act as his deputy. It was her especial duty to protect the state and
  all peaceful associations of mankind, which she possessed the power of
  defending when occasion required. She encouraged the maintenance of law
  and order, and defended the right on all occasions, for which reason, in
  the Trojan war she espouses the cause of the Greeks and exerts all her
  influence on their behalf. The Areopagus, a court of justice where
  religious causes and murders were tried, was believed to have been
  instituted by her, and when both sides happened to have an equal number
  of votes she gave the casting-vote in favour of the accused. She was the
  patroness of learning, science, and art, more particularly where these
  contributed directly towards the welfare of nations. She presided over
  all inventions connected with agriculture, invented the plough, and
  taught mankind how to use oxen for farming purposes. She also instructed
  mankind in the use of numbers, trumpets, chariots,      c., and presided
  over the building of the Argo, a name="NtA_20"
  href="#Nt_20">[20] thereby encouraging the useful art of
  navigation. She also taught the Greeks how to build the wooden horse by
  means of which the destruction of Troy was effected.

  The safety of cities depended on her care, for which reason her
  temples were generally built on the citadels, and she was supposed to
  watch over the defence of the walls, fortifications, harbours,      c. A
  divinity who so faithfully guarded the best interests of the state, by
  not only protecting it from the attacks of enemies, but also by
  developing its chief resources of wealth and prosperity, was worthily
  chosen as the presiding deity of the state, and in this character as an
  essentially political goddess she was called Athene-Polias.

  The fact of Athene having been born clad in armour, which merely
  signified that her virtue and purity were unassailable, has given rise to
  the erroneous supposition that she was the presiding goddess of war; but
  a deeper  a
  name="page45">[45]study of her character in all its bearings
  proves that, in contradistinction to her brother Ares, the god of war,
  who loved strife for its own sake, she only takes up arms to protect the
  innocent and deserving against tyrannical oppression. It is true that in
  the Iliad we frequently see her on the battlefield fighting valiantly,
  and protecting her favourite heroes; but this is always at the command of
  Zeus, who even supplies her with arms for the purpose, as it is supposed
  that she possessed none of her own. A marked feature in the
  representations of this deity is the ægis, that wonderful shield given to
  her by her father as a further means of defence, which, when in danger,
  she swung so swiftly round and round that it kept at a distance all
  antagonistic influences; hence her name Pallas, from pallo, I
  swing. In the centre of this shield, which was covered with dragon's
  scales, bordered with serpents, and which she sometimes wore as a
  breastplate, was the awe-inspiring head of the Medusa, which had the
  effect of turning to stone all beholders.

  In addition to the many functions which she exercised in connection
  with the state, Athene presided over the two chief departments of
  feminine industry, spinning and weaving. In the latter art she herself
  displayed unrivalled ability and exquisite taste. She wove her own robe
  and that of Hera, which last she is said to have embroidered very richly;
  she also gave Jason a cloak wrought by herself, when he set forth in
  quest of the Golden Fleece. Being on one occasion challenged to a contest
  in this accomplishment by a mortal maiden named Arachne, whom she had
  instructed in the art of weaving, she accepted the challenge and was
  completely vanquished by her pupil. Angry at her defeat, she struck the
  unfortunate maiden on the forehead with the shuttle which she held in her
  hand; and Arachne, being of a sensitive nature, was so hurt by this
  indignity that she hung herself in despair, and was changed by Athene
  into a spider. This goddess is said to have invented the flute, a
  name="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21">[21] upon  !-- Page 46
  -->[46]which she played
  with considerable talent, until one day, being laughed at by the
  assembled gods and goddesses for the contortions which her countenance
  assumed during these musical efforts, she hastily ran to a fountain in
  order to convince herself whether she deserved their ridicule. Finding to
  her intense disgust that such was indeed the fact, she threw the flute
  away, and never raised it to her lips again.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0046-1.png"
      alt="Athene" title="Athene" />
  
  Athene is usually represented fully draped; she has a serious and
  thoughtful aspect, as though replete with earnestness and wisdom; the
  beautiful oval contour of her countenance is adorned by the luxuriance of
  her wealth of hair, which is drawn back from the temples and hangs down
  in careless grace; she looks the embodiment of strength, grandeur, and
  majesty; whilst her broad shoulders and small hips give her a slightly
  masculine appearance.

  When represented as the war-goddess she appears clad in armour, with a
  helmet on her head, from which waves a large plume; she carries the ægis
  on her arm, and in her hand a golden staff, which possessed the property
  of endowing her chosen favourites with youth and dignity.

  Athene was universally worshipped throughout Greece, but was regarded
  with special veneration by the Athenians, she being the guardian deity of
  Athens. Her most celebrated temple was the Parthenon, which stood on the
   a
  name="page47">[47]Acropolis at Athens, and contained her
  world-renowned statue by Phidias, which ranks second only to that of Zeus
  by the same great artist. This colossal statue was 39 feet high, and was
  composed of ivory and gold; its majestic beauty formed the chief
  attraction of the temple. It represented her standing erect, bearing her
  spear and shield; in her hand she held an image of Nike, and at her feet
  there lay a serpent.

  The tree sacred to her was the olive, which she herself produced in a
  contest with Poseidon. The olive-tree thus called into existence was
  preserved in the temple of Erectheus, on the Acropolis, and is said to
  have possessed such marvellous vitality, that when the Persians burned it
  after sacking the town it immediately burst forth into new shoots.

  The principal festival held in honour of this divinity was the
  Panathenæa.

  The owl, cock, and serpent were the animals sacred to her, and her
  sacrifices were rams, bulls, and cows.

      alt="Minerva" title="Minerva" />
  
MINERVA.

  The Minerva of the Romans was identified with the Pallas-Athene of the
  Greeks. Like her she presides over learning and all useful arts, and is
  the patroness of the feminine accomplishments of sewing, spinning,
  weaving,      c. Schools were under her especial care, and schoolboys,
  therefore, had holidays during her festivals (the Greater Quinquatria),
  when they always brought a gift to their master, called the Minerval.

  It is worthy of notice that the only three divinities  !-- Page 48
  -->[48]worshipped in
  the Capitol were Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, and in their joint honour
  the Ludi Maximi or great games were held.

THEMIS.

  Themis, who has already been alluded to as the wife of Zeus, was the
  daughter of Cronus and Rhea, and personified those divine laws of justice
  and order by means of which the well-being and morality of communities
  are regulated. She presided over the assemblies of the people and the
  laws of hospitality. To her was intrusted the office of convoking the
  assembly of the gods, and she was also mistress of ritual and ceremony.
  On account of her great wisdom Zeus himself frequently sought her counsel
  and acted upon her advice. Themis was a prophetic divinity, and had an
  oracle near the river Cephissus in B       otia.

  She is usually represented as being in the full maturity of womanhood,
  of fair aspect, and wearing a flowing garment, which drapes her noble,
  majestic form; in her right hand she holds the sword of justice, and in
  her left the scales, which indicate the impartiality with which every
  cause is carefully weighed by her, her eyes being bandaged so that the
  personality of the individual should carry no weight with respect to the
  verdict.

  This divinity is sometimes identified with Tyche, sometimes with
  Ananke.

  Themis, like so many other Greek divinities, takes the place of a more
  ancient deity of the same name who was a daughter of Uranus and Gæa. This
  elder Themis inherited from her mother the gift of prophecy, and when she
  became merged into her younger representative she transmitted to her this
  prophetic power.

HESTIA (Vesta).

  Hestia was the daughter of Cronus and Rhea. She was the goddess of
  Fire in its first application to the wants of mankind, hence she was
  essentially the presiding deity  a
  name="page49">[49]of the domestic hearth and the guardian
  spirit of man, and it was her pure and benign influence which was
  supposed to protect the sanctity of domestic life.

  Now in these early ages the hearth was regarded as the most important
  and most sacred portion of the dwelling, probably because the protection
  of the fire was an important consideration, for if once permitted to
  become extinct, re-ignition was attended with extreme difficulty. In
  fact, the hearth was held so sacred that it constituted the sanctum of
  the family, for which reason it was always erected in the centre of every
  house. It was a few feet in height and was built of stone; the fire was
  placed on the top of it, and served the double purpose of preparing the
  daily meals, and consuming the family sacrifices. Round this domestic
  hearth or altar were gathered the various members of the family, the head
  of the house occupying the place of honour nearest the hearth. Here
  prayers were said and sacrifices offered, and here also every kind and
  loving feeling was fostered, which even extended to the hunted and guilty
  stranger, who, if he once succeeded in touching this sacred altar, was
  safe from pursuit and punishment, and was henceforth placed under the
  protection of the family. Any crime committed within the sacred precincts
  of the domestic hearth was invariably visited by death.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0050-1.png"
      alt="Vesta" title="Vesta" />
  
  In Grecian cities there was a common hall, called the Prytaneum, in
  which the members of the government had their meals at the expense of the
  state, and here too was the Hestia, or public hearth, with its fire, by
  means of which those meals were prepared. It was customary for emigrants
  to take with them a portion of this sacred fire, which they jealously
  guarded and brought with them to their new home, where it served as a
  connecting link between the young Greek colony and the mother country.
  Hestia is generally represented standing, and in accordance with the
  dignity and sanctity of her character, always appears fully draped. Her
  countenance is distinguished by a serene gravity of expression.  !-- Page
  50 -->[50]

VESTA.

  Vesta occupies a distinguished place among the earlier divinities of
  the Romans. Her temple in Rome, containing as it were the hearthstone of
  the nation, stood close beside the palace of Numa Pompilius.

  On her altar burned the never-ceasing fire, which was tended by her
  priestesses, the Vestal Virgins. a name="NtA_22"
  href="#Nt_22">[22]

  The temple of Vesta was circular in form, and contained that sacred
  and highly prized treasure the Palladium of Troy. a name="NtA_23"
  href="#Nt_23">[23]

  The great festival in honour of Vesta, called the Vestalia, was
  celebrated on the 9th of June.

DEMETER (Ceres).

  Demeter (from Ge-meter, earth-mother) was the daughter of
  Cronus and Rhea.[24] She
  represented that portion of Gæa (the whole solid earth) which we call the
  earth's crust, and which produces all vegetation. As goddess of
  agriculture, field-fruits, plenty, and productiveness, she was the
  sustainer of material life, and was therefore a divinity of great
  importance. When ancient Gæa lost, with Uranus, her position as a ruling
  divinity, she abdicated her sway in favour of her daughter Rhea, who
  henceforth inherited the powers which her mother had previously
  possessed, receiving in her place the honour and worship of mankind. In a
  very old poem Gæa is accordingly described as retiring to a cavern in the
  bowels  a
  name="page51">[51]of the earth, where she sits in the lap of
  her daughter, slumbering, moaning, and nodding for ever and ever.

  It is necessary to keep clearly in view the distinctive difference
  between the three great earth-goddesses Gæa, Rhea, and Demeter. Gæa
  represents the earth as a whole, with its mighty subterranean forces;
  Rhea is that productive power which causes vegetation to spring forth,
  thus sustaining men and animals; Demeter, by presiding over agriculture,
  directs and utilizes Rhea's productive powers. But in later times, when
  Rhea, like other ancient divinities, loses her importance as a ruling
  deity, Demeter assumes all her functions and attributes, and then becomes
  the goddess of the life-producing and life-maintaining earth-crust. We
  must bear in mind the fact that man in his primitive state knew neither
  how to sow nor how to till the ground; when, therefore, he had exhausted
  the pastures which surrounded him he was compelled to seek others which
  were as yet unreaped; thus, roaming constantly from one place to another,
  settled habitations, and consequently civilizing influences, were
  impossible. Demeter, however, by introducing a knowledge of agriculture,
  put an end, at once and for ever, to that nomadic life which was now no
  longer necessary.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0051-1.png"
      alt="Demeter" title="Demeter" />
  
  The favour of Demeter was believed to bring mankind rich harvests and
  fruitful crops, whereas her displeasure caused blight, drought, and
  famine. The island of Sicily was supposed to be under her especial
  protection, and there she was regarded with particular veneration, the
  Sicilians naturally attributing the wonderful fertility of their country
  to the partiality of the goddess.

  Demeter is usually represented as a woman of noble  !-- Page 52
  -->[52]bearing and
  majestic appearance, tall, matronly, and dignified, with beautiful golden
  hair, which falls in rippling curls over her stately shoulders, the
  yellow locks being emblematical of the ripened ears of corn. Sometimes
  she appears seated in a chariot drawn by winged dragons, at others she
  stands erect, her figure drawn up to its full height, and always fully
  draped; she bears a sheaf of wheat-ears in one hand and a lighted torch
  in the other. The wheat-ears are not unfrequently replaced by a bunch of
  poppies, with which her brows are also garlanded, though sometimes she
  merely wears a simple riband in her hair.

  Demeter, as the wife of Zeus, became the mother of Persephone
  (Proserpine), to whom she was so tenderly attached that her whole life
  was bound up in her, and she knew no happiness except in her society. One
  day, however, whilst Persephone was gathering flowers in a meadow,
  attended by the ocean-nymphs, she saw to her surprise a beautiful
  narcissus, from the stem of which sprang forth a hundred blossoms.
  Drawing near to examine this lovely flower, whose exquisite scent
  perfumed the air, she stooped down to gather it, suspecting no evil, when
  a yawning abyss opened at her feet, and Aïdes, the grim ruler of the
  lower world, appeared from its depths, seated in his dazzling chariot
  drawn by four black horses. Regardless of her tears and the shrieks of
  her female attendants, Aïdes seized the terrified maiden, and bore her
  away to the gloomy realms over which he reigned in melancholy grandeur.
  Helios, the all-seeing sun-god, and Hecate, a mysterious and very ancient
  divinity, alone heard her cries for aid, but were powerless to help her.
  When Demeter became conscious of her loss her grief was intense, and she
  refused to be comforted. She knew not where to seek for her child, but
  feeling that repose and inaction were impossible, she set out on her
  weary search, taking with her two torches which she lighted in the flames
  of Mount Etna to guide her on her way. For nine long days and nights she
  wandered on, inquiring of every one she met for tidings of her child.
  [53]But
  all was in vain! Neither gods nor men could give her the comfort which
  her soul so hungered for. At last, on the tenth day, the disconsolate
  mother met Hecate, who informed her that she had heard her daughter's
  cries, but knew not who it was that had borne her away. By Hecate's
  advice Demeter consulted Helios, whose all-seeing eye nothing escapes,
  and from him she learnt that it was Zeus himself who had permitted Aïdes
  to seize Persephone, and transport her to the lower world in order that
  she might become his wife. Indignant with Zeus for having given his
  sanction to the abduction of his daughter, and filled with the bitterest
  sorrow, she abandoned her home in Olympus, and refused all heavenly food.
  Disguising herself as an old woman, she descended upon earth, and
  commenced a weary pilgrimage among mankind. One evening she arrived at a
  place called Eleusis, in Attica, and sat down to rest herself near a well
  beneath the shade of an olive-tree. The youthful daughters of Celeus, the
  king of the country, came with their pails of brass to draw water from
  this well, and seeing that the tired wayfarer appeared faint and
  dispirited, they spoke kindly to her, asking who she was, and whence she
  came. Demeter replied that she had made her escape from pirates, who had
  captured her, and added that she would feel grateful for a home with any
  worthy family, whom she would be willing to serve in a menial capacity.
  The princesses, on hearing this, begged Demeter to have a moment's
  patience while they returned home and consulted their mother, Metaneira.
  They soon brought the joyful intelligence that she was desirous of
  securing her services as nurse to her infant son Demophoon, or
  Triptolemus. When Demeter arrived at the house a radiant light suddenly
  illumined her, which circumstance so overawed Metaneira that she treated
  the unknown stranger with the greatest respect, and hospitably offered
  her food and drink. But Demeter, still grief-worn and dejected, refused
  her friendly offers, and held herself apart from the social board. At
  length, however, the maid-servant Iambe succeeded, by means  !-- Page 54
  -->[54]of playful jests
  and merriment, in somewhat dispelling the grief of the sorrowing mother,
  causing her at times to smile in spite of herself, and even inducing her
  to partake of a mixture of barley-meal, mint, and water, which was
  prepared according to the directions of the goddess herself. Time passed
  on, and the young child throve amazingly under the care of his kind and
  judicious nurse, who, however, gave him no food, but anointed him daily
  with ambrosia, and every night laid him secretly in the fire in order to
  render him immortal and exempt from old age. But, unfortunately, this
  benevolent design on the part of Demeter was frustrated by Metaneira
  herself, whose curiosity, one night, impelled her to watch the
  proceedings of the mysterious being who nursed her child. When to her
  horror she beheld her son placed in the flames, she shrieked aloud.
  Demeter, incensed at this untimely interruption, instantly withdrew the
  child, and throwing him on the ground, revealed herself in her true
  character. The bent and aged form had vanished, and in its place there
  stood a bright and beauteous being, whose golden locks streamed over her
  shoulders in richest luxuriance, her whole aspect bespeaking dignity and
  majesty. She told the awe-struck Metaneira that she was the goddess
  Demeter, and had intended to make her son immortal, but that her fatal
  curiosity had rendered this impossible, adding, however, that the child,
  having slept in her arms, and been nursed on her lap, should ever command
  the respect and esteem of mankind. She then desired that a temple and
  altar should be erected to her on a neighbouring hill by the people of
  Eleusis, promising that she herself would direct them how to perform the
  sacred rites and ceremonies, which should be observed in her honour. With
  these words she took her departure never to return.

  Obedient to her commands, Celeus called together a meeting of his
  people, and built the temple on the spot which the goddess had indicated.
  It was soon completed, and Demeter took up her abode in it, but her heart
  was still sad for the loss of her daughter, and the whole world felt the
  influence of her grief and dejection. This was  span
  class="pagenum">[55]indeed a terrible year
  for mankind. Demeter no longer smiled on the earth she was wont to bless,
  and though the husbandman sowed the grain, and the groaning oxen ploughed
  the fields, no harvest rewarded their labour. All was barren, dreary
  desolation. The world was threatened with famine, and the gods with the
  loss of their accustomed honours and sacrifices; it became evident,
  therefore, to Zeus himself that some measures must be adopted to appease
  the anger of the goddess. He accordingly despatched Iris and many of the
  other gods and goddesses to implore Demeter to return to Olympus; but all
  their prayers were fruitless. The incensed goddess swore that until her
  daughter was restored to her she would not allow the grain to spring
  forth from the earth. At length Zeus sent Hermes, his faithful messenger,
  to the lower world with a petition to Aïdes, urgently entreating him to
  restore Persephone to the arms of her disconsolate mother. When he
  arrived in the gloomy realms of Aïdes, Hermes found him seated on a
  throne with the beautiful Persephone beside him, sorrowfully bewailing
  her unhappy fate. On learning his errand, Aïdes consented to resign
  Persephone, who joyfully prepared to follow the messenger of the gods to
  the abode of life and light. Before taking leave of her husband, he
  presented to her a few seeds of pomegranate, which in her excitement she
  thoughtlessly swallowed, and this simple act, as the sequel will show,
  materially affected her whole future life. The meeting between mother and
  child was one of unmixed rapture, and for the moment all the past was
  forgotten. The loving mother's happiness would now have been complete had
  not Aïdes asserted his rights. These were, that if any immortal had
  tasted food in his realms they were bound to remain there for ever. Of
  course the ruler of the lower world had to prove this assertion. This,
  however, he found no difficulty in doing, as Ascalaphus, the son of
  Acheron and Orphne, was his witness to the fact. a name="NtA_25"
  href="#Nt_25">[25] Zeus, pitying the disappointment of
  Demeter at finding  a
  name="page56">[56]her hopes thus blighted, succeeded in
  effecting a compromise by inducing his brother Aïdes to allow Persephone
  to spend six months of the year with the gods above, whilst during the
  other six she was to be the joyless companion of her grim lord below.
  Accompanied by her daughter, the beautiful Persephone, Demeter now
  resumed her long-abandoned dwelling in Olympus; the sympathetic earth
  responded gaily to her bright smiles, the corn at once sprang forth from
  the ground in fullest plenty, the trees, which late were sered and bare,
  now donned their brightest emerald robes, and the flowers, so long
  imprisoned in the hard, dry soil, filled the whole air with their
  fragrant perfume. Thus ends this charming story, which was a favourite
  theme with all the classic authors.

  It is very possible that the poets who first created this graceful
  myth merely intended it as an allegory to illustrate the change of
  seasons; in the course of time, however, a literal meaning became
  attached to this and similar poetical fancies, and thus the people of
  Greece came to regard as an article of religious belief what, in the
  first instance, was nothing more than a poetic simile.

  In the temple erected to Demeter at Eleusis, the famous Eleusinian
  Mysteries were instituted by the goddess herself. It is exceedingly
  difficult, as in the case of all secret societies, to discover anything
  with certainty concerning these sacred rites. The most plausible
  supposition is that the doctrines taught by the priests to the favoured
  few whom they initiated, were religious truths which were deemed unfit
  for the uninstructed mind of the multitude. For instance, it is supposed
  that the myth of Demeter and Persephone was explained by the teachers of
  the Mysteries to signify the temporary loss which mother earth sustains
  every year when the icy breath of winter robs her of her flowers and
  fruits and grain.

  It is believed that in later times a still deeper meaning was conveyed
  by this beautiful myth, viz., the doctrine of the immortality of the
  soul. The grain, which, as it were, remains dead for a time in the dark
  earth, only  a
  name="page57">[57]to rise one day dressed in a newer and
  lovelier garb, was supposed to symbolize the soul, which, after death,
  frees itself from corruption, to live again under a better and purer
  form.

  When Demeter instituted the Eleusinian Mysteries, Celeus and his
  family were the first to be initiated, Celeus himself being appointed
  high-priest. His son Triptolemus and his daughters, who acted as
  priestesses, assisted him in the duties of his sacred office. The
  Mysteries were celebrated by the Athenians every five years, and were,
  for a long time, their exclusive privilege. They took place by
  torchlight, and were conducted with the greatest solemnity.

  In order to spread abroad the blessings which agriculture confers,
  Demeter presented Triptolemus with her chariot drawn by winged dragons,
  and, giving him some grains of corn, desired him to journey through the
  world, teaching mankind the arts of agriculture and husbandry.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0058-1.png"
      alt="Ceres" title="Ceres" />
  
  Demeter exercised great severity towards those who incurred her
  displeasure. We find examples of this in the stories of Stellio and
  Eresicthon. Stellio was a youth who ridiculed the goddess for the
  eagerness with which she was eating a bowl of porridge, when weary and
  faint in the vain search for her daughter. Resolved that he should never
  again have an opportunity of thus offending, she angrily threw into his
  face the remainder of the food, and changed him into a spotted
  lizard.

  Eresicthon, son of Triopas, had drawn upon himself the anger of
  Demeter by cutting down her sacred groves, for which she punished him
  with a constant and insatiable hunger. He sold all his possessions in
  order to satisfy his cravings, and was forced at last to devour his own
  limbs. His daughter Metra, who was devotedly attached to him, possessed
  the power of transforming herself into a variety of different animals. By
  this means she contrived to support her father, who sold her again and
  again each time she assumed a different form, and thus he dragged on a
  pitiful existence.  a

CERES.

  The Roman Ceres is actually the Greek Demeter under another name, her
  attributes, worship, festivals,      c., being precisely identical.

  The Romans were indebted to Sicily for this divinity, her worship
  having been introduced by the Greek colonists who settled there.

  The Cerealia, or festivals in honour of Ceres, commenced on the 12th
  of April, and lasted several days.

APHRODITE (Venus).

  Aphrodite (from aphros, sea-foam, and dite, issued), the
  daughter of Zeus and a sea-nymph called Dione, was the goddess of Love
  and Beauty.

  Dione, being a sea-nymph, gave birth to her daughter beneath the
  waves; but the child of the heaven-inhabiting Zeus was forced to ascend
  from the ocean-depths and mount to the snow-capped summits of Olympus, in
  order to breathe that ethereal and most refined atmosphere which pertains
  to the celestial gods.

  Aphrodite was the mother of Eros (Cupid), the god of Love, also of
  Æneas, the great Trojan hero and the head of that Greek colony which
  settled in Italy, and from which arose the city of Rome. As a mother
  Aphrodite claims our sympathy for the tenderness she exhibits towards her
  children. Homer tells us in his Iliad, how, when Æneas was wounded in
  battle, she came to his assistance, regardless of personal danger, and
  was herself severely wounded in attempting to save his life.  !-- Page 59
  -->[59]

  Aphrodite was tenderly attached to a lovely youth, called Adonis,
  whose exquisite beauty has become proverbial. He was a motherless babe,
  and Aphrodite, taking pity on him, placed him in a chest and intrusted
  him to the care of Persephone, who became so fond of the beautiful youth
  that she refused to part with him. Zeus, being appealed to by the rival
  foster-mothers, decided that Adonis should spend four months of every
  year with Persephone, four with Aphrodite, whilst during the remaining
  four months he should be left to his own devices. He became, however, so
  attached to Aphrodite that he voluntarily devoted to her the time at his
  own disposal. Adonis was killed, during the chase, by a wild boar, to the
  great grief of Aphrodite, who bemoaned his loss so persistently that
  Aïdes, moved with pity, permitted him to pass six months of every year
  with her, whilst the remaining half of the year was spent by him in the
  lower world.

  Aphrodite possessed a magic girdle (the famous cestus) which
  she frequently lent to unhappy maidens suffering from the pangs of
  unrequited love, as it was endowed with the power of inspiring affection
  for the wearer, whom it invested with every attribute of grace, beauty,
  and fascination.

  Her usual attendants are the Charites or Graces (Euphrosyne, Aglaia,
  and Thalia), who are represented undraped and intertwined in a loving
  embrace.

  In Hesiod's Theogony she is supposed to belong to the more
  ancient divinities, and, whilst those of later date are represented as
  having descended one from another, and all more or less from Zeus,
  Aphrodite has a variously-accounted-for, yet independent origin.

  The most poetical version of her birth is that when Uranus was wounded
  by his son Cronus, his blood mingled with the foam of the sea, whereupon
  the bubbling waters at once assumed a rosy tint, and from their depths
  arose, in all the surpassing glory of her loveliness, Aphrodite, goddess
  of love and beauty! Shaking her long, fair tresses, the water-drops
  rolled down into the beautiful  a
  name="page60">[60]sea-shell in which she stood, and became
  transformed into pure glistening pearls. Wafted by the soft and balmy
  breezes, she floated on to Cythera, and was thence transported to the
  island of Cyprus. Lightly she stepped on shore, and under the gentle
  pressure of her delicate foot the dry and rigid sand became transformed
  into a verdant meadow, where every varied shade of colour and every sweet
  odour charmed the senses. The whole island of Cyprus became clothed with
  verdure, and greeted this fairest of all created beings with a glad smile
  of friendly welcome. Here she was received by the Seasons, who decked her
  with garments of immortal fabric, encircling her fair brow with a wreath
  of purest gold, whilst from her ears depended costly rings, and a
  glittering chain embraced her swan-like throat. And now, arrayed in all
  the panoply of her irresistible charms, the nymphs escort her to the
  dazzling halls of Olympus, where she is received with ecstatic enthusiasm
  by the admiring gods and goddesses. The gods all vied with each other in
  aspiring to the honour of her hand, but Hephæstus became the envied
  possessor of this lovely being, who, however, proved as faithless as she
  was beautiful, and caused her husband much unhappiness, owing to the
  preference she showed at various times for some of the other gods and
  also for mortal men.

      alt="Aphrodite" title="Aphrodite" />
  
  The celebrated Venus of Milo, now in the Louvre, is an exquisite
  statue of this divinity. The head is beautifully formed; the rich waves
  of hair descend on her rather low but broad forehead and are caught up
  gracefully in a small knot at the back of the head; the expression of the
  face is most bewitching, and bespeaks the perfect  span
  class="pagenum">[61]joyousness of a happy
  nature combined with the dignity of a goddess; the drapery falls in
  careless folds from the waist downwards, and her whole attitude is the
  embodiment of all that is graceful and lovely in womanhood. She is of
  medium height, and the form is perfect in its symmetry and faultless
  proportions.

  Aphrodite is also frequently represented in the act of confining her
  dripping locks in a knot, whilst her attendant nymphs envelop her in a
  gauzy veil.

  The animals sacred to her were the dove, swan, swallow, and sparrow.
  Her favourite plants were the myrtle, apple-tree, rose, and poppy.

  The worship of Aphrodite is supposed to have been introduced into
  Greece from Central Asia. There is no doubt that she was originally
  identical with the famous Astarté, the Ashtoreth of the Bible, against
  whose idolatrous worship and infamous rites the prophets of old hurled
  forth their sublime and powerful anathemas.

VENUS.

  The Venus of the Romans was identified with the Aphrodite of the
  Greeks. The worship of this divinity was only established in Rome in
  comparatively later times. Annual festivals, called Veneralia, were held
  in her honour, and the month of April, when flowers and plants spring
  forth afresh, was sacred to her. She was worshipped as Venus Cloacina (or
  the Purifier), and as Venus Myrtea (or the myrtle goddess), an epithet
  derived from the myrtle, the emblem of Love.

HELIOS (Sol).

  The worship of Helios was introduced into Greece from Asia. According
  to the earliest conceptions of the Greeks he was not only the sun-god,
  but also the personification of life and all life-giving power, for light
  is well known to be an indispensable condition of all healthy terrestrial
  life. The worship of the sun was originally very widely spread,  !-- Page
  62 -->[62]not only
  among the early Greeks themselves, but also among other primitive
  nations. To us the sun is simply the orb of light, which, high above our
  heads, performs each day the functions assigned to it by a mighty and
  invisible Power; we can, therefore, form but a faint idea of the
  impression which it produced upon the spirit of a people whose intellect
  was still in its infancy, and who believed, with child-like simplicity,
  that every power of nature was a divinity, which, according as its
  character was baleful or beneficent, worked for the destruction or
  benefit of the human race.

  Helios, who was the son of the Titans Hyperion and Theia, is described
  as rising every morning in the east, preceded by his sister Eos (the
  Dawn), who, with her rosy fingers, paints the tips of the mountains, and
  draws aside that misty veil through which her brother is about to appear.
  When he has burst forth in all the glorious light of day, Eos disappears,
  and Helios now drives his flame-darting chariot along the accustomed
  track. This chariot, which is of burnished gold, is drawn by four
  fire-breathing steeds, behind which the young god stands erect with
  flashing eyes, his head surrounded with rays, holding in one hand the
  reins of those fiery coursers which in all hands save his are
  unmanageable. When towards evening he descends the curve a name="NtA_26"
  href="#Nt_26">[26] in order to cool his burning forehead
  in the waters of the deep sea, he is followed closely by his sister
  Selene (the Moon), who is now prepared to take charge of the world, and
  illumine with her silver crescent the dusky night. Helios meanwhile rests
  from his labours, and, reclining softly on the cool fragrant couch
  prepared for him by the sea-nymphs, recruits himself for another
  life-giving, joy-inspiring, and beauteous day.

  It may appear strange that, although the Greeks considered the earth
  to be a flat circle, no explanation is given of the fact that Helios
  sinks down in the far  a
  name="page63">[63]west regularly every evening, and yet
  reappears as regularly every morning in the east. Whether he was supposed
  to pass through Tartarus, and thus regain the opposite extremity through
  the bowels of the earth, or whether they thought he possessed any other
  means of making this transit, there is not a line in either Homer or
  Hesiod to prove. In later times, however, the poets invented the graceful
  fiction, that when Helios had finished his course, and reached the
  western side of the curve, a winged-boat, or cup, which had been made for
  him by Hephæstus, awaited him there, and conveyed him rapidly, with his
  glorious equipage, to the east, where he recommenced his bright and
  glowing career.

  This divinity was invoked as a witness when a solemn oath was taken,
  as it was believed that nothing escaped his all-seeing eye, and it was
  this fact which enabled him to inform Demeter of the fate of her
  daughter, as already related. He was supposed to possess flocks and herds
  in various localities, which may possibly be intended to represent the
  days and nights of the year, or the stars of heaven.

  Helios is said to have loved Clytie, a daughter of Oceanus, who
  ardently returned his affection; but in the course of time the fickle
  sun-god transferred his devotion to Leucothea, the daughter of Orchamus,
  king of the eastern countries, which so angered the forsaken Clytie that
  she informed Orchamus of his daughter's attachment, and he punished her
  by inhumanly burying her alive. Helios, overcome with grief, endeavoured,
  by every means in his power, to recall her to life. At last, finding all
  his efforts unavailing, he sprinkled her grave with heavenly nectar, and
  immediately there sprang forth from the spot a shoot of frankincense,
  which spread around its aromatic perfume.

  The jealous Clytie gained nothing by her cruel conduct, for the
  sun-god came to her no more. Inconsolable at his loss, she threw herself
  upon the ground, and refused all sustenance. For nine long days she
  turned her face towards the glorious god of day, as he moved along the
   a
  name="page64">[64]heavens, till at length her limbs became
  rooted in the ground, and she was transformed into a flower, which ever
  turns towards the sun.

  Helios married Perse, daughter of Oceanus, and their children were,
  Aëtes, king of Colchis (celebrated in the legend of the Argonauts as the
  possessor of the Golden Fleece), and Circe, the renowned sorceress.

  Helios had another son named Phaethon, whose mother was Clymene, one
  of the Oceanides. The youth was very beautiful, and a great favourite
  with Aphrodite, who intrusted him with the care of one of her temples,
  which flattering proof of her regard caused him to become vain and
  presumptuous. His friend Epaphus, son of Zeus and Io, endeavoured to
  check his youthful vanity by pretending to disbelieve his assertion that
  the sun-god was his father. Phaethon, full of resentment, and eager to be
  able to refute the calumny, hastened to his mother Clymene, and besought
  her to tell him whether Helios was really his father. Moved by his
  entreaties, and at the same time angry at the reproach of Epaphus,
  Clymene pointed to the glorious sun, then shining down upon them, and
  assured her son that in that bright orb he beheld the author of his
  being, adding that if he had still any doubt, he might visit the radiant
  dwelling of the great god of light and inquire for himself. Overjoyed at
  his mother's reassuring words, and following the directions she gave him,
  Phaethon quickly wended his way to his father's palace.

  As he entered the palace of the sun-god the dazzling rays almost
  blinded him, and prevented him from approaching the throne on which his
  father was seated, surrounded by the Hours, Days, Months, Years, and
  Seasons. Helios, who with his all-seeing eye had watched him from afar,
  removed his crown of glittering rays, and bade him not to be afraid, but
  to draw near to his father. Encouraged by this kind reception, Phaethon
  entreated him to bestow upon him such a proof of his love, that all the
  world might be convinced that he was indeed his son; whereupon Helios
  desired him to ask any favour he pleased,  span
  class="pagenum">[65]and swore by the Styx
  that it should be granted. The impetuous youth immediately requested
  permission to drive the chariot of the sun for one whole day. His father
  listened horror-struck to this presumptuous demand, and by representing
  the many dangers which would beset his path, endeavoured to dissuade him
  from so perilous an undertaking; but his son, deaf to all advice, pressed
  his point with such pertinacity, that Helios was reluctantly compelled to
  lead him to the chariot. Phaethon paused for a moment to admire the
  beauty of the glittering equipage, the gift of the god of fire, who had
  formed it of gold, and ornamented it with precious stones, which
  reflected the rays of the sun. And now Helios, seeing his sister, the
  Dawn, opening her doors in the rosy east, ordered the Hours to yoke the
  horses. The goddesses speedily obeyed the command, and the father then
  anointed the face of his son with a sacred balm, to enable him to endure
  the burning flames which issued from the nostrils of the steeds, and
  sorrowfully placing his crown of rays upon his head, desired him to
  ascend the chariot.

  The eager youth joyfully took his place and grasped the coveted reins,
  but no sooner did the fiery coursers of the sun feel the inexperienced
  hand which attempted to guide them, than they became restive and
  unmanageable. Wildly they rushed out of their accustomed track, now
  soaring so high as to threaten the heavens with destruction, now
  descending so low as nearly to set the earth on fire. At last the
  unfortunate charioteer, blinded with the glare, and terrified at the
  awful devastation he had caused, dropped the reins from his trembling
  hands. Mountains and forests were in flames, rivers and streams were
  dried up, and a general conflagration was imminent. The scorched earth
  now called on Zeus for help, who hurled his thunderbolt at Phaethon, and
  with a flash of lightning brought the fiery steeds to a standstill. The
  lifeless body of the youth fell headlong into the river Eridanus, a
  name="NtA_27" href="#Nt_27">[27] where it was received and
  buried by the  a
  name="page66">[66]nymphs of the stream. His sisters mourned so
  long for him that they were transformed by Zeus into poplars, and the
  tears they shed, falling into the waters, became drops of clear,
  transparent amber. Cycnus, the faithful friend of the unhappy Phaethon,
  felt such overwhelming grief at his terrible fate, that he pined and
  wasted away. The gods, moved with compassion, transformed him into a
  swan, which for ever brooded over the fatal spot where the waters had
  closed over the head of his unfortunate friend.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0066-1.png"
      alt="Colossus of Rhodes" title="Colossus of Rhodes" />
  
  The chief seat of the worship of Helios was the island of Rhodes,
  which according to the following myth was his especial territory. At the
  time of the Titanomachia, when the gods were dividing the world by lot,
  Helios happened to be absent, and consequently received no share. He,
  therefore, complained to Zeus, who proposed to have a new allotment, but
  this Helios would not allow, saying, that as he pursued his daily
  journey, his penetrating eye had beheld a lovely, fertile island lying
  beneath the waves of the ocean, and that if the immortals would swear to
  give him the undisturbed possession of this spot, he would be content to
  accept it as his share of the universe. The gods took the oath, whereupon
  the island of Rhodes immediately raised itself above the surface of the
  waters.

  The famous Colossus of Rhodes, which was one of the seven wonders of
  the world, was erected in honour of Helios. This wonderful statue was 105
  feet high, and was formed entirely of brass; it formed the entrance to
  the harbour at Rhodes, and the largest vessel could easily sail between
  the legs, which stood on moles, each side of the harbour. Though so
  gigantic, it was perfectly proportioned in every part. Some idea of  !--
  Page 67 -->[67]its size
  may be gained from the fact that very few people were able to span the
  thumb of this statue with their arms. In the interior of the Colossus was
  a winding staircase leading to the top, from the summit of which, by
  means of a telescope, the coast of Syria, and also the shores of Egypt,
  are said to have been visible. a name="NtA_28"
  href="#Nt_28">[28]

EOS (Aurora).

  Eos, the Dawn, like her brother Helios, whose advent she always
  announced, was also deified by the early Greeks. She too had her own
  chariot, which she drove across the vast horizon both morning and night,
  before and after the sun-god. Hence she is not merely the personification
  of the rosy morn, but also of twilight, for which reason her palace is
  placed in the west, on the island Ææa. The abode of Eos is a magnificent
  structure, surrounded by flowery meads and velvety lawns, where nymphs
  and other immortal beings, wind in and out in the mazy figures of the
  dance, whilst the music of a sweetly-tuned melody accompanies their
  graceful, gliding movements.

  Eos is described by the poets as a beautiful maiden with rosy arms and
  fingers, and large wings, whose plumage is of an ever-changing hue; she
  bears a star on her forehead, and a torch in her hand. Wrapping round her
  the rich folds of her violet-tinged mantle, she leaves her couch before
  the break of day, and herself yokes her two horses, Lampetus and
  Phaethon, to her glorious chariot. She then hastens with active
  cheerfulness to open the gates of heaven, in order to herald the approach
  of her brother, the god of day, whilst the tender plants and flowers,
  revived by the morning dew, lift their heads to welcome her as she
  passes.

[68]

  Eos first married the Titan Astræus, a name="NtA_29"
  href="#Nt_29">[29] and their children were Heosphorus
  (Hesperus), the evening star, and the winds. She afterwards became united
  to Tithonus, son of Laomedon, king of Troy, who had won her affection by
  his unrivalled beauty; and Eos, unhappy at the thought of their being
  ever separated by death, obtained for him from Zeus the gift of
  immortality, forgetting, however, to add to it that of eternal youth. The
  consequence was that when, in the course of time, Tithonus grew old and
  decrepid, and lost all the beauty which had won her admiration, Eos
  became disgusted with his infirmities, and at last shut him up in a
  chamber, where soon little else was left of him but his voice, which had
  now sunk into a weak, feeble quaver. According to some of the later
  poets, he became so weary of his cheerless and miserable existence, that
  he entreated to be allowed to die. This was, however, impossible; but
  Eos, pitying his unhappy condition, exerted her divine power, and changed
  him into a grasshopper, which is, as it were, all voice, and whose
  monotonous, ceaseless chirpings may not inaptly be compared to the
  meaningless babble of extreme old age.

PH       BUS-APOLLO.

  Ph       bus-Apollo, the god of Light, Prophecy, Music, Poetry, and
  the Arts and Sciences, is by far the noblest conception within the whole
  range of Greek mythology, and his worship, which not only extended to all
  the states of Greece, but also to Asia Minor and to every Greek colony
  throughout the world, stands out among the most ancient and
  strongly-marked features of Grecian history, and exerted a more decided
  influence over the Greek nation, than that of any other deity, not
  excepting Zeus himself.

  Apollo was the son of Zeus and Leto, and was born beneath the shade of
  a palm tree which grew at the foot  span
  class="pagenum">[69]of Mount Cynthus, on the
  barren and rocky island of Delos. The poets tell us that the earth smiled
  when the young god first beheld the light of day, and that Delos became
  so proud and exultant at the honour thus conferred upon her, that she
  covered herself with golden flowers; swans surrounded the island, and the
  Delian nymphs celebrated his birth with songs of joy.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0069-1.png"
      alt="Apollo" title="Apollo" />
  
  The unhappy Leto, driven to Delos by the relentless persecutions of
  Hera, was not long permitted to enjoy her haven of refuge. Being still
  tormented by her enemy, the young mother was once more obliged to fly;
  she therefore resigned the charge of her new-born babe to the goddess
  Themis, who carefully wrapped the helpless infant in swaddling-clothes,
  and fed him with nectar and ambrosia; but he had no sooner partaken of
  the heavenly food than, to the amazement of the goddess, he burst asunder
  the bands which confined his infant limbs, and springing to his feet,
  appeared before her as a full-grown youth of divine strength and beauty.
  He now demanded a lyre and a bow, declaring that henceforth he would
  announce to mankind the will of his father Zeus. "The golden lyre," said
  he, "shall be my friend, the bent bow my delight, and in oracles will I
  foretell the dark future." With these words he ascended to Olympus, where
  he was received with joyful acclamations into the assembly of the
  celestial gods, who acknowledged him as the most beautiful and glorious
  of all the sons of Zeus.

  Ph       bus-Apollo was the god of light in a twofold  !-- Page 70
  -->[70]signification:
  first, as representing the great orb of day which illumines the world;
  and secondly, as the heavenly light which animates the soul of man. He
  inherited his function as sun-god from Helios, with whom, in later times,
  he was so completely identified, that the personality of the one became
  gradually merged in that of the other. We, accordingly, find Helios
  frequently confounded with Apollo, myths belonging to the former
  attributed to the latter; and with some tribes       the Ionic, for
  instance       so complete is this identification, that Apollo is called
  by them Helios-Apollo.

  As the divinity whose power is developed in the broad light of day, he
  brings joy and delight to nature, and health and prosperity to man. By
  the influence of his warm and gentle rays he disperses the noxious
  vapours of the night, assists the grain to ripen and the flowers to
  bloom.

  But although, as god of the sun, he is a life-giving and
  life-preserving power, who, by his genial influence, dispels the cold of
  winter, he is, at the same time, the god who, by means of his fiercely
  darting rays, could spread disease and send sudden death to men and
  animals; and it is to this phase of his character that we must look for
  the explanation of his being considered, in conjunction with his
  twin-sister, Artemis (as moon-goddess), a divinity of death. The brother
  and sister share this function between them, he taking man and she woman
  as her aim, and those especially who died in the bloom of youth, or at an
  advanced age, were believed to have been killed by their gentle arrows.
  But Apollo did not always send an easy death. We see in the Iliad
  how, when angry with the Greeks, the "god of the silver bow" strode down
  from Olympus, with his quiver full of death-bringing darts, and sent a
  raging pestilence into their camp. For nine days he let fly his fatal
  arrows, first on animals and then on men, till the air became darkened
  with the smoke from the funeral pyres.

  In his character as god of light, Ph       bus-Apollo is the
  protecting deity of shepherds, because it is he who warms  !-- Page 71
  -->[71]the fields and
  meadows, and gives rich pastures to the flocks, thereby gladdening the
  heart of the herdsman.

  As the temperate heat of the sun exercises so invigorating an effect
  on man and animals, and promotes the growth of those medicinal herbs and
  vegetable productions necessary for the cure of diseases,
  Ph       bus-Apollo was supposed to possess the power of restoring life
  and health; hence he was regarded as the god of healing; but this feature
  in his character we shall find more particularly developed in his son
  Asclepius (Æsculapius), the veritable god of the healing art.

  Pursuing our analysis of the various phases in the character of
  Ph       bus-Apollo, we find that with the first beams of his genial
  light, all nature awakens to renewed life, and the woods re-echo with the
  jubilant sound of the untaught lays, warbled by thousands of feathered
  choristers. Hence, by a natural inference, he is the god of music, and
  as, according to the belief of the ancients, the inspirations of genius
  were inseparably connected with the glorious light of heaven, he is also
  the god of poetry, and acts as the special patron of the arts and
  sciences. Apollo is himself the heavenly musician among the Olympic gods,
  whose banquets are gladdened by the wondrous strains which he produces
  from his favourite instrument, the seven-stringed lyre. In the cultus of
  Apollo, music formed a distinguishing feature. All sacred dances, and
  even the sacrifices in his honour, were performed to the sound of musical
  instruments; and it is, in a great measure, owing to the influence which
  the music in his worship exercised on the Greek nation, that Apollo came
  to be regarded as the leader of the nine Muses, the legitimate divinities
  of poetry and song. In this character he is called Musagetes, and is
  always represented robed in a long flowing garment; his lyre, to the
  tones of which he appears to be singing, is suspended by a band across
  the chest; his head is encircled by a wreath of laurel, and his long
  hair, streaming down over his shoulders, gives him a somewhat effeminate
  appearance.

  And now we must view the glorious god of light under  !-- Page 72
  -->[72]another, and (as
  far as regards his influence over the Greek nation) a much more important
  aspect; for, in historical times, all the other functions and attributes
  of Apollo sink into comparative insignificance before the great power
  which he exercised as god of prophecy. It is true that all Greek gods
  were endowed, to a certain extent, with the faculty of foretelling future
  events; but Apollo, as sun-god, was the concentration of all prophetic
  power, as it was supposed that nothing escaped his all-seeing eye, which
  penetrated the most hidden recesses, and laid bare the secrets which lay
  concealed behind the dark veil of the future.

  We have seen that when Apollo assumed his god-like form, he took his
  place among the immortals; but he had not long enjoyed the rapturous
  delights of Olympus, before he felt within him an ardent desire to fulfil
  his great mission of interpreting to mankind the will of his mighty
  father. He accordingly descended to earth, and travelled through many
  countries, seeking a fitting site upon which to establish an oracle. At
  length he reached the southern side of the rocky heights of Parnassus,
  beneath which lay the harbour of Crissa. Here, under the overhanging
  cliff, he found a secluded spot, where, from the most ancient times,
  there had existed an oracle, in which Gæa herself had revealed the future
  to man, and which, in Deucalion's time, she had resigned to Themis. It
  was guarded by the huge serpent Python, the scourge of the surrounding
  neighbourhood, and the terror alike of men and cattle. The young god,
  full of confidence in his unerring aim, attacked and slew the monster
  with his arrows, thus freeing land and people from their mighty
  enemy.

  The grateful inhabitants, anxious to do honour to their deliverer,
  flocked round Apollo, who proceeded to mark out a plan for a temple, and,
  with the assistance of numbers of eager volunteers, a suitable edifice
  was soon erected. It now became necessary to choose ministers, who would
  offer up sacrifices, interpret his prophecies to the people, and take
  charge of the temple. Looking round, he saw in the far distance a vessel
  bound from Crete to the  a
  name="page73">[73]Peloponnesus, and determined to avail
  himself of her crew for his service. Assuming the shape of an enormous
  dolphin, he agitated the waters to such a degree, that the ship was
  tossed violently to and fro, to the great alarm of the mariners; at the
  same time he raised a mighty wind, which drove the ship into the harbour
  of Crissa, where she ran aground. The terrified sailors dared not set
  foot on shore; but Apollo, under the form of a vigorous youth, stepped
  down to the vessel, revealed himself in his true character, and informed
  them that it was he who had driven them to Crissa, in order that they
  might become his priests, and serve him in his temple. Arrived at the
  sacred fane, he instructed them how to perform the services in his
  honour, and desired them to worship him under the name of
  Apollo-Delphinios, because he had first appeared to them under the form
  of a dolphin. Thus was established the far-famed oracle of Delphi, the
  only institution of the kind which was not exclusively national, for it
  was consulted by Lydians, Phrygians, Etruscans, Romans,      c., and, in
  fact, was held in the highest repute all over the world. In obedience to
  its decrees, the laws of Lycurgus were introduced, and the earliest Greek
  colonies founded. No cities were built without first consulting the
  Delphic oracle, for it was believed that Apollo took special delight in
  the founding of cities, the first stone of which he laid in person; nor
  was any enterprise ever undertaken, without inquiring at this sacred fane
  as to its probable success.

  But that which brought Apollo more closely home to the hearts of the
  people, and raised the whole moral tone of the Greek nation, was the
  belief, gradually developed with the intelligence of the people, that he
  was the god who accepted repentance as an atonement for sin, who pardoned
  the contrite sinner, and who acted as the special protector of those,
  who, like Orestes, had committed a crime, which required long years of
  expiation.

  Apollo is represented by the poets as being eternally young; his
  countenance, glowing with joyous life, is the embodiment of immortal
  beauty; his eyes are of a deep  a
  name="page74">[74]blue; his forehead low, but broad and
  intellectual; his hair, which falls over his shoulders in long waving
  locks, is of a golden, or warm chestnut hue. He is crowned with laurel,
  and wears a purple robe; in his hand he bears his silver bow, which is
  unbent when he smiles, but ready for use when he menaces evil-doers.

  But Apollo, the eternally beautiful youth, the perfection of all that
  is graceful and refined, rarely seems to have been happy in his love;
  either his advances met with a repulse, or his union with the object of
  his affection was attended with fatal consequences.

  His first love was Daphne (daughter of Peneus, the river-god), who was
  so averse to marriage that she entreated her father to allow her to lead
  a life of celibacy, and devote herself to the chase, which she loved to
  the exclusion of all other pursuits. But one day, soon after his victory
  over the Python, Apollo happened to see Eros bending his bow, and proud
  of his own superior strength and skill, he laughed at the efforts of the
  little archer, saying that such a weapon was more suited to the one who
  had just killed the terrible serpent. Eros angrily replied that his arrow
  should pierce the heart of the mocker himself, and flying off to the
  summit of Mount Parnassus, he drew from his quiver two darts of different
  workmanship       one of gold, which had the effect of inspiring love;
  the other of lead, which created aversion. Taking aim at Apollo, he
  pierced his breast with the golden shaft, whilst the leaden one he
  discharged into the bosom of the beautiful Daphne. The son of Leto
  instantly felt the most ardent affection for the nymph, who, on her part,
  evinced the greatest dislike towards her divine lover, and, at his
  approach, fled from him like a hunted deer. He called upon her in the
  most endearing accents to stay, but she still sped on, until at length,
  becoming faint with fatigue, and fearing that she was about to succumb,
  she called upon the gods to come to her aid. Hardly had she uttered her
  prayer before a heavy torpor seized her limbs, and just as Apollo threw
  out his arms to embrace her, she became transformed  span
  class="pagenum">[75]into a laurel-bush. He
  sorrowfully crowned his head with its leaves, and declared, that in
  memory of his love, it should henceforth remain evergreen, and be held
  sacred to him.

  He next sought the love of Marpessa, the daughter of Evenus; but
  though her father approved his suit, the maiden preferred a youth named
  Idas, who contrived to carry her off in a winged chariot which he had
  procured from Poseidon. Apollo pursued the fugitives, whom he quickly
  overtook, and forcibly seizing the bride, refused to resign her. Zeus
  then interfered, and declared that Marpessa herself must decide which of
  her lovers should claim her as his wife. After due reflection she
  accepted Idas as her husband, judiciously concluding that although the
  attractions of the divine Apollo were superior to those of her lover, it
  would be wiser to unite herself to a mortal, who, growing old with
  herself, would be less likely to forsake her, when advancing years should
  rob her of her charms.

  Cassandra, daughter of Priam, king of Troy, was another object of the
  love of Apollo. She feigned to return his affection, and promised to
  marry him, provided he would confer upon her the gift of prophecy; but
  having received the boon she desired, the treacherous maiden refused to
  comply with the conditions upon which it had been granted. Incensed at
  her breach of faith, Apollo, unable to recall the gift he had bestowed,
  rendered it useless by causing her predictions to fail in obtaining
  credence. Cassandra became famous in history for her prophetic powers,
  but her prophecies were never believed. For instance, she warned her
  brother Paris that if he brought back a wife from Greece he would cause
  the destruction of his father's house and kingdom; she also warned the
  Trojans not to admit the wooden horse within the walls of the city, and
  foretold to Agamemnon all the disasters which afterwards befell him.

  Apollo afterwards married Coronis, a nymph of Larissa, and thought
  himself happy in the possession of her faithful love; but once more he
  was doomed to  a
  name="page76">[76]disappointment, for one day his favourite
  bird, the crow, flew to him with the intelligence that his wife had
  transferred her affections to a youth of Haemonia. Apollo, burning with
  rage, instantly destroyed her with one of his death-bringing darts. Too
  late he repented of his rashness, for she had been tenderly beloved by
  him, and he would fain have recalled her to life; but, although he
  exerted all his healing powers, his efforts were in vain. He punished the
  crow for its garrulity by changing the colour of its plumage from pure
  white to intense black, and forbade it to fly any longer among the other
  birds.

  Coronis left an infant son named Asclepius, who afterwards became god
  of medicine. His powers were so extraordinary that he could not only cure
  the sick, but could even restore the dead to life. At last Aïdes
  complained to Zeus that the number of shades conducted to his dominions
  was daily decreasing, and the great ruler of Olympus, fearing that
  mankind, thus protected against sickness and death, would be able to defy
  the gods themselves, killed Asclepius with one of his thunderbolts. The
  loss of his highly gifted son so exasperated Apollo that, being unable to
  vent his anger on Zeus, he destroyed the Cyclops, who had forged the
  fatal thunderbolts. For this offence, Apollo would have been banished by
  Zeus to Tartarus, but at the earnest intercession of Leto he partially
  relented, and contented himself with depriving him of all power and
  dignity, and imposing on him a temporary servitude in the house of
  Admetus, king of Thessaly. Apollo faithfully served his royal master for
  nine years in the humble capacity of a shepherd, and was treated by him
  with every kindness and consideration. During the period of his service
  the king sought the hand of Alcestis, the beautiful daughter of Pelias,
  son of Poseidon; but her father declared that he would only resign her to
  the suitor who should succeed in yoking a lion and a wild boar to his
  chariot. By the aid of his divine herdsman, Admetus accomplished this
  difficult task, and gained his bride. Nor was this the only favour which
  the king received from the exiled god, for Apollo obtained from  !-- Page
  77 -->[77]the Fates the
  gift of immortality for his benefactor, on condition that when his last
  hour approached, some member of his own family should be willing to die
  in his stead. When the fatal hour arrived, and Admetus felt that he was
  at the point of death, he implored his aged parents to yield to him their
  few remaining days. But "life is sweet" even to old age, and they both
  refused to make the sacrifice demanded of them. Alcestis, however, who
  had secretly devoted herself to death for her husband, was seized with a
  mortal sickness, which kept pace with his rapid recovery. The devoted
  wife breathed her last in the arms of Admetus, and he had just consigned
  her to the tomb, when Heracles chanced to come to the palace. Admetus
  held the rites of hospitality so sacred, that he at first kept silence
  with regard to his great bereavement; but as soon as his friend heard
  what had occurred, he bravely descended into the tomb, and when death
  came to claim his prey, he exerted his marvellous strength, and held him
  in his arms, until he promised to restore the beautiful and heroic queen
  to the bosom of her family.

  Whilst pursuing the peaceful life of a shepherd, Apollo formed a
  strong friendship with two youths named Hyacinthus and Cyparissus, but
  the great favour shown to them by the god did not suffice to shield them
  from misfortune. The former was one day throwing the discus with Apollo,
  when, running too eagerly to take up the one thrown by the god, he was
  struck on the head with it and killed on the spot. Apollo was overcome
  with grief at the sad end of his young favourite, but being unable to
  restore him to life, he changed him into the flower called after him the
  Hyacinth. Cyparissus had the misfortune to kill by accident one of
  Apollo's favourite stags, which so preyed on his mind that he gradually
  pined away, and died of a broken heart. He was transformed by the god
  into a cypress-tree, which owes its name to this story.

  After these sad occurrences Apollo quitted Thessaly and repaired to
  Phrygia, in Asia Minor, where he met Poseidon, who, like himself, was in
  exile, and condemned  a
  name="page78">[78]to a temporary servitude on earth. The two
  gods now entered the service of Laomedon, king of Troy, Apollo
  undertaking to tend his flocks, and Poseidon to build the walls of the
  city. But Apollo also contributed his assistance in the erection of those
  wonderful walls, and, by the aid of his marvellous musical powers, the
  labours of his fellow-worker, Poseidon, were rendered so light and easy
  that his otherwise arduous task advanced with astonishing celerity; for,
  as the master-hand of the god of music grasped the chords of his lyre, a
  name="NtA_30" href="#Nt_30">[30] the huge blocks of stone
  moved of their own accord, adjusting themselves with the utmost nicety
  into the places designed for them.

  But though Apollo was so renowned in the art of music, there were two
  individuals who had the effrontery to consider themselves equal to him in
  this respect, and, accordingly, each challenged him to compete with them
  in a musical contest. These were Marsyas and Pan. Marsyas was a satyr,
  who, having picked up the flute which Athene had thrown away in disgust,
  discovered, to his great delight and astonishment, that, in consequence
  of its having touched the lips of a goddess, it played of itself in the
  most charming manner. Marsyas, who was a great lover of music, and much
  beloved on this account by all the elf-like denizens of the woods and
  glens, was so intoxicated with joy at this discovery, that he foolishly
  challenged Apollo to compete with him in a musical contest. The challenge
  being accepted, the Muses were chosen umpires, and it was decided that
  the unsuccessful candidate should suffer the punishment of being flayed
  alive. For a long time the merits of both claimants remained so equally
  balanced, that it was impossible to award the palm of victory to either,
  seeing which, Apollo, resolved to conquer, added the sweet tones of his
  melodious voice to the strains of his lyre,  span
  class="pagenum">[79]and this at once turned
  the scale in his favour. The unhappy Marsyas being defeated, had to
  undergo the terrible penalty, and his untimely fate was universally
  lamented; indeed the Satyrs and Dryads, his companions, wept so
  incessantly at his fate, that their tears, uniting together, formed a
  river in Phrygia which is still known by the name of Marsyas.

  The result of the contest with Pan was by no means of so serious a
  character. The god of shepherds having affirmed that he could play more
  skilfully on his flute of seven reeds (the syrinx or Pan's pipe), than
  Apollo on his world-renowned lyre, a contest ensued, in which Apollo was
  pronounced the victor by all the judges appointed to decide between the
  rival candidates. Midas, king of Phrygia, alone demurred at this
  decision, having the bad taste to prefer the uncouth tones of the Pan's
  pipe to the refined melodies of Apollo's lyre. Incensed at the obstinacy
  and stupidity of the Phrygian king, Apollo punished him by giving him the
  ears of an ass. Midas, horrified at being thus disfigured, determined to
  hide his disgrace from his subjects by means of a cap; his barber,
  however, could not be kept in ignorance of the fact, and was therefore
  bribed with rich gifts never to reveal it. Finding, however, that he
  could not keep the secret any longer, he dug a hole in the ground into
  which he whispered it; then closing up the aperture he returned home,
  feeling greatly relieved at having thus eased his mind of its burden. But
  after all, this very humiliating secret was revealed to the world, for
  some reeds which sprung up from the spot murmured incessantly, as they
  waved to and fro in the wind: "King Midas has the ears of an ass."

  In the sad and beautiful story of Niobe, daughter of Tantalus, and
  wife of Amphion, king of Thebes, we have another instance of the severe
  punishments meted out by Apollo to those who in any way incurred his
  displeasure. Niobe was the proud mother of seven sons and seven
  daughters, and exulting in the number of her children, she, upon one
  occasion, ridiculed the worship of Leto,  span
  class="pagenum">[80]because she had but one
  son and daughter, and desired the Thebans, for the future, to give to her
  the honours and sacrifices which they had hitherto offered to the mother
  of Apollo and Artemis. The sacrilegious words had scarcely passed her
  lips before Apollo called upon his sister Artemis to assist him in
  avenging the insult offered to their mother, and soon their invisible
  arrows sped through the air. Apollo slew all the sons, and Artemis had
  already slain all the daughters save one, the youngest and best beloved,
  whom Niobe clasped in her arms, when the agonized mother implored the
  enraged deities to leave her, at least, one out of all her beautiful
  children; but, even as she prayed, the deadly arrow reached the heart of
  this child also. Meanwhile the unhappy father, unable to bear the loss of
  his children, had destroyed himself, and his dead body lay beside the
  lifeless corpse of his favourite son. Widowed and childless, the
  heart-broken mother sat among her dead, and the gods, in pity for her
  unutterable woe, turned her into a stone, which they transferred to
  Siphylus, her native Phrygian mountain, where it still continues to shed
  tears.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0080-1.png"
      alt="Niobe" title="Niobe" />
  
  The punishment of Niobe forms the subject of a magnificent marble
  group, which was found at Rome in the year 1553, and is now in the
  gallery of Uffizi, at Florence.

  The renowned singer Orpheus was the son of Apollo and Calliope, the
  muse of epic poetry, and, as might be expected with parents so highly
  gifted, was endowed with most distinguished intellectual qualifications.
  He was a poet, a teacher of the religious doctrines known as the Orphic
  mysteries, and a great musician, having inherited from his father an
  extraordinary genius for music.  a
  name="page81">[81]When he sang to the sweet tones of his lyre,
  he charmed all nature, and summoned round him the wild beasts of the
  forests, who, under the influence of his music, became tame and gentle as
  lambs. The madly rushing torrents stopped their rapid course, and the
  very mountains and trees moved from their places at the sound of his
  entrancing melodies.

  Orpheus became united to a lovely nymph named Eurydice, the daughter
  of the sea-god Nereus, whom he fondly loved. She was no less attached to
  him, and their married life was full of joy and happiness. But it was
  only short-lived; for Aristæus, a name="NtA_31"
  href="#Nt_31">[31] the half-brother of Orpheus, having
  fallen in love with the beautiful Eurydice, forcibly endeavoured to take
  her from her husband, and as she fled across some fields to elude his
  pursuit, she was bitten in the foot by a venomous snake, which lay
  concealed in the long grass. Eurydice died of the wound, and her
  sorrowing husband filled the groves and valleys with his piteous and
  unceasing lamentations.

  His longing to behold her once more became at last so unconquerable,
  that he determined to brave the horrors of the lower world, in order to
  entreat Aïdes to restore to him his beloved wife. Armed only with his
  golden lyre, the gift of Apollo, he descended into the gloomy depths of
  Hades, where his heavenly music arrested for a while the torments of the
  unhappy sufferers. The stone of Sisyphus remained motionless; Tantalus
  forgot his perpetual thirst; the wheel of Ixion ceased to revolve; and
  even the Furies shed tears, and withheld for a time their persecutions.
  Undismayed at the scenes of horror and suffering which met his view on
  every side, he pursued his way until he arrived at the palace of Aïdes.
  Presenting himself before the throne on which sat the stony-hearted king
  and his consort Persephone, Orpheus recounted his woes to the sound of
  his lyre. Moved to pity by his sweet strains, they listened to his  !--
  Page 82 --> a
  name="page82">[82]melancholy story, and consented to release
  Eurydice on condition that he should not look upon her until they reached
  the upper world. Orpheus gladly promised to comply with this injunction,
  and, followed by Eurydice, ascended the steep and gloomy path which led
  to the realms of life and light. All went well until he was just about to
  pass the extreme limits of Hades, when, forgetting for the moment the
  hard condition, he turned to convince himself that his beloved wife was
  really behind him. The glance was fatal, and destroyed all his hopes of
  happiness; for, as he yearningly stretched out his arms to embrace her,
  she was caught back, and vanished from his sight for ever. The grief of
  Orpheus at this second loss was even more intense than before, and he now
  avoided all human society. In vain did the nymphs, his once chosen
  companions, endeavour to win him back to his accustomed haunts; their
  power to charm was gone, and music was now his sole consolation. He
  wandered forth alone, choosing the wildest and most secluded paths, and
  the hills and vales resounded with his pathetic melodies. At last he
  happened to cross the path of some Thracian women, who were performing
  the wild rites of Dionysus (Bacchus), and in their mad fury at his
  refusing to join them, they furiously attacked him, and tore him in
  pieces. In pity for his unhappy fate, the Muses collected his remains,
  which they buried at the foot of Mount Olympus, and the nightingale
  warbled a funeral dirge over his grave. His head was thrown into the
  river Hebrus, and as it floated down the stream, the lips still continued
  to murmur the beloved name of Eurydice.

  The chief seat of the worship of Apollo was at Delphi, and here was
  the most magnificent of all his temples, the foundation of which reaches
  far beyond all historical knowledge, and which contained immense riches,
  the offerings of kings and private persons, who had received favourable
  replies from the oracle. The Greeks believed Delphi to be the central
  point of the earth, because two eagles sent forth by Zeus, one from the
  east, the other  a
  name="page83">[83]from the west, were said to have arrived
  there at the same moment.

  The Pythian games, celebrated in honour of the victory of Apollo over
  the Python, took place at Delphi every four years. At the first
  celebration of these games, gods, goddesses, and heroes contended for the
  prizes, which were at first of gold or silver, but consisted, in later
  times, of simple laurel wreaths.

  On account of its being the place of his birth, the whole island of
  Delos was consecrated to Apollo, where he was worshipped with great
  solemnity; the greatest care was taken to preserve the sanctity of the
  spot, for which reason no one was suffered to be buried there. At the
  foot of Mount Cynthus was a splendid temple of Apollo which possessed an
  oracle, and was enriched with magnificent offerings from all parts of
  Greece. Even foreign nations held this island sacred, for when the
  Persians passed it on their way to attack Greece, they not only sailed
  by, leaving it uninjured, but sent rich presents to the temple. Games,
  called Delia, instituted by Theseus, were celebrated at Delos every four
  years.

  A festival termed the Gymnopedæa was held at Sparta in honour of
  Apollo, in which boys sang the praises of the gods, and of the three
  hundred Lacedæmonians who fell at the battle of Thermopylæ.

  Wolves and hawks were sacrificed to Apollo, and the birds sacred to
  him were the hawk, raven, and swan.

ROMAN APOLLO.

  The worship of Apollo never occupied the all-important position in
  Rome which it held in Greece, nor was it introduced till a comparatively
  late period. There was no sanctuary erected to this divinity until  span
  class="scac">B.C. 430, when the Romans, in order to avert a
  plague, built a temple in his honour; but we do not find the worship of
  Apollo becoming in any way prominent until the time of Augustus, who,
  having called upon this god for aid before the famous battle of Actium,
  ascribed the victory which he  a
  name="page84">[84]gained, to his influence, and accordingly
  erected a temple there, which he enriched with a portion of the
  spoil.

  Augustus afterwards built another temple in honour of Apollo, on the
  Palatine Hill, in which at the foot of his statue, were deposited two
  gilt chests, containing the Sibylline oracles. These oracles were
  collected to replace the Sibylline books originally preserved in the
  temple of Jupiter, which were destroyed when that edifice was burned.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0084-1.png"
      alt="Sibyl" title="Sibyl" />
  
  The Sibyls were maidens who had received the gift of prophecy, and the
  privilege of living to an incredible age. One of these Sibyls (known as
  the Cumæan) appeared to Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome,
  offering for sale nine books, which she informed him had been written by
  herself. Not knowing who she was, Tarquin refused to buy them, upon which
  she burned three, and returned with six, demanding the same price as
  before. Being again driven away as an impostor, she again retired and
  burned three more, returning with the remaining three, for which she
  still asked the same price as at first. Tarquin, amazed at her
  inconsistency, now consulted the Augurs, who blamed him for not having
  bought the nine books when they were first offered to him, and desired
  him to secure the remaining three, at whatever price they were to be had.
  He, accordingly, purchased the volumes, which were found to contain
  predictions of great importance to the Romans. After the disposal of the
  books, the Sibyl vanished, and was seen no more.

  The most beautiful and renowned of all the statues of Apollo now in
  existence, is that known as the Apollo Belvedere, which was found in 1503
  among the ruins of  a
  name="page85">[85]ancient Antium. It was purchased by Pope
  Julius II., who removed it to the Belvedere of the Vatican, from whence
  it takes its name, and where it has been, for more than three hundred
  years, the admiration of the world. When Rome was taken, and plundered by
  the French, this celebrated statue was transported to Paris, and placed
  in the museum there, but in 1815 it was restored to its former place in
  the Vatican. The attitude of the figure, which is more than seven feet
  high, is inimitable in its freedom, grace, and majesty. The forehead is
  noble and intellectual, and the whole countenance so exquisite in its
  beauty, that one pauses spell-bound to gaze on so perfect a conception.
  The god has a very youthful appearance, as is usual in all his
  representations, and with the exception of a short mantle which falls
  from his shoulders, is unclothed. He stands against the trunk of a tree,
  up which a serpent is creeping, and his left arm is outstretched, as
  though about to punish.

HECATE.

  Hecate would appear to have been originally a moon-goddess worshipped
  by the Thracians. She became confounded, and eventually identified with
  Selene and Persephone, and is one of those divinities of whom the
  ancients had various conflicting accounts.

  Hecate was the daughter of Perses and "gold-wreathed" Astræa (the
  starry night[32]), and her
  sway extended over earth, heaven, and hell, for which reason she is
  represented in works of art as a triple divinity, having three female
  bodies, all young and beautiful, and united together.

  In later times, when this divinity becomes identified with Persephone,
  she is supposed to inhabit the lower world as a malignant deity, and
  henceforward it is the gloomy, awe-inspiring side of her character which
  alone  a
  name="page86">[86]develops itself. She now presides over all
  practices connected with witchcraft and enchantments, haunts sepulchres,
  and the point where two roads cross, and lonely spots where murders have
  been committed. She was supposed to be connected with the appearance of
  ghosts and spectres, to possess unlimited influence over the powers of
  the lower world, and to be able to lay to rest unearthly apparitions by
  her magic spells and incantations.

  Hecate appears as a gigantic woman, bearing a torch and a sword. Her
  feet and hair are formed of snakes, and her passage is accompanied by
  voices of thunder, weird shrieks and yells, and the deep baying and
  howling of dogs.

  Her favour was propitiated by offerings and sacrifices, principally
  consisting of black lambs. Her festivals were celebrated at night, by
  torchlight, when these animals were offered to her, accompanied by many
  peculiar ceremonies. These ceremonies were carried out with the minutest
  attention to details, as it was believed that the omission of the
  slightest particular would afford to her ministers, the evil spirits of
  the lower world, who hovered round the worshippers, an opportunity for
  entering among them, and exerting their baneful influence. At the end of
  every month food was placed wherever two roads met, in readiness for her
  and other malignant divinities.

  In studying the peculiar characteristics which Hecate assumes when she
  usurps the place of Persephone, the rightful mistress of the lower world,
  we are reminded of the various superstitions with regard to spectres,
  witchcraft,      c., which have, even down to our own times, exerted so
  powerful an influence over the minds of the ignorant, and which would
  appear to owe their origin to a remote pagan source.

SELENE (Luna).

  Just as Helios personified the sun, so his sister Selene represented
  the moon, and was supposed to drive her  span
  class="pagenum">[87]chariot across the sky
  whilst her brother was reposing after the toils of the day.

  When the shades of evening began to enfold the earth, the two
  milk-white steeds of Selene rose out of the mysterious depths of Oceanus.
  Seated in a silvery chariot, and accompanied by her daughter Herse, the
  goddess of the dew, appeared the mild and gentle queen of the night, with
  a crescent on her fair brow, a gauzy veil flowing behind, and a lighted
  torch in her hand.

  Selene greatly admired a beautiful young shepherd named Endymion, to
  whom Zeus had accorded the privilege of eternal youth, combined with the
  faculty of sleeping whenever he desired, and as long as he wished. Seeing
  this lovely youth fast asleep on Mount Latmus, Selene was so struck with
  his beauty, that she came down every night from heaven to watch over and
  protect him.

ARTEMIS (Diana).

  Artemis was worshipped by the Greeks under various appellations, to
  each of which belonged special characteristics. Thus she is known as the
  Arcadian, Ephesian and Brauronian Artemis, and also as Selene-Artemis,
  and in order fully to comprehend the worship of this divinity, we must
  consider her under each aspect.

ARCADIAN ARTEMIS.

  The Arcadian Artemis (the real Artemis of the Greeks) was the daughter
  of Zeus and Leto, and twin-sister of Apollo. She was the goddess of
  Hunting and Chastity, and having obtained from her father permission to
  lead a life of celibacy, she ever remained a maiden-divinity. Artemis is
  the feminine counterpart of her brother, the glorious god of Light, and,
  like him, though she deals out destruction and sudden death to men and
  animals, she is also able to alleviate suffering and cure diseases. Like
  Apollo also, she is skilled in the use of the bow, but in a far more
  eminent degree, for in the character of Artemis, who devoted herself to
  the chase with passionate  a
  name="page88">[88]ardour, this becomes an all-distinguishing
  feature. Armed with her bow and quiver, and attended by her train of
  huntresses, who were nymphs of the woods and springs, she roamed over the
  mountains in pursuit of her favourite exercise, destroying in her course
  the wild animals of the forest. When the chase was ended, Artemis and her
  maidens loved to assemble in a shady grove, or on the banks of a
  favourite stream, where they joined in the merry song, or graceful dance,
  and made the hills resound with their joyous shouts.

  As the type of purity and chastity, Artemis was especially venerated
  by young maidens, who, before marrying, sacrificed their hair to her. She
  was also the patroness of those vowed to celibacy, and punished severely
  any infringement of their obligation.

  The huntress-goddess is represented as being a head taller than her
  attendant nymphs, and always appears as a youthful and slender maiden.
  Her features are beautiful, but wanting in gentleness of expression; her
  hair is gathered negligently into a knot at the back of her well-shaped
  head; and her figure, though somewhat masculine, is most graceful in its
  attitude and proportions. The short robe she wears, leaves her limbs free
  for the exercise of the chase, her devotion to which is indicated by the
  quiver which is slung over her shoulder, and the bow which she bears in
  her hand.

  There are many famous statues of this divinity; but the most
  celebrated is that known as the Diana of Versailles, now in the Louvre,
  which forms a not unworthy companion to the Apollo-Belvedere of the
  Vatican. In this statue, the goddess appears in the act of rescuing a
  hunted deer from its pursuers, on whom she is turning with angry mien.
  One hand is laid protectingly on the head of the stag, whilst with the
  other she draws an arrow from the quiver which hangs over her
  shoulder.

  Her attributes are the bow, quiver, and spear. The animals sacred to
  her are the hind, dog, bear, and wild boar.

  Artemis promptly resented any disregard or neglect of  !-- Page 89
  -->[89]her worship; a
  remarkable instance of this is shown in the story of the Calydonian
  boar-hunt, which is as follows:       

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0089-1.png"
      alt="Artemis" title="Artemis" />
  
  Oeneus, king of Calydon in Ætolia, had incurred the displeasure of
  Artemis by neglecting to include her in a general sacrifice to the gods
  which he had offered up, out of gratitude for a bountiful harvest. The
  goddess, enraged at this neglect, sent a wild boar of extraordinary size
  and prodigious strength, which destroyed the sprouting grain, laid waste
  the fields, and threatened the inhabitants with famine and death. At this
  juncture, Meleager, the brave son of Oeneus, returned from the Argonautic
  expedition, and finding his country ravaged by this dreadful scourge,
  entreated the assistance of all the celebrated heroes of the age to join
  him in hunting the ferocious monster. Among the most famous of those who
  responded to his call were Jason, Castor and Pollux, Idas and Lynceus,
  Peleus, Telamon, Admetus, Perithous, and Theseus. The brothers of Althea,
  wife of Oeneus, joined the hunters, and Meleager also enlisted into his
  service the fleet-footed huntress Atalanta.

  The father of this maiden was Schoeneus, an Arcadian, who,
  disappointed at the birth of a daughter when he had particularly desired
  a son, had exposed her on the Parthenian Hill, where he left her to
  perish. Here she was nursed by a she-bear, and at last found by some
  hunters, who reared her, and gave her the name of Atalanta. As the maiden
  grew up, she became an ardent  a
  name="page90">[90]lover of the chase, and was alike
  distinguished for her beauty and courage. Though often wooed, she led a
  life of strict celibacy, an oracle having predicted that inevitable
  misfortune awaited her, should she give herself in marriage to any of her
  numerous suitors.

  Many of the heroes objected to hunt in company with a maiden; but
  Meleager, who loved Atalanta, overcame their opposition, and the valiant
  band set out on their expedition. Atalanta was the first to wound the
  boar with her spear, but not before two of the heroes had met their death
  from his fierce tusks. After a long and desperate encounter, Meleager
  succeeded in killing the monster, and presented the head and hide to
  Atalanta, as trophies of the victory. The uncles of Meleager, however,
  forcibly took the hide from the maiden, claiming their right to the spoil
  as next of kin, if Meleager resigned it. Artemis, whose anger was still
  unappeased, caused a violent quarrel to arise between uncles and nephew,
  and, in the struggle which ensued, Meleager killed his mother's brothers,
  and then restored the hide to Atalanta. When Althea beheld the dead
  bodies of the slain heroes, her grief and anger knew no bounds. She swore
  to revenge the death of her brothers on her own son, and unfortunately
  for him, the instrument of vengeance lay ready to her hand.

  At the birth of Meleager, the Moirae, or Fates, entered the house of
  Oeneus, and pointing to a piece of wood then burning on the hearth,
  declared that as soon as it was consumed the babe would surely die. On
  hearing this, Althea seized the brand, laid it up carefully in a chest,
  and henceforth preserved it as her most precious possession. But now,
  love for her son giving place to the resentment she felt against the
  murderer of her brothers, she threw the fatal brand into the devouring
  flames. As it consumed, the vigour of Meleager wasted away, and when it
  was reduced to ashes, he expired. Repenting too late the terrible effects
  of her rash deed, Althea, in remorse and despair, took away her own
  life.

  The news of the courage and intrepidity displayed by  !-- Page 91
  -->[91]Atalanta in the
  famous boar-hunt, being carried to the ears of her father, caused him to
  acknowledge his long-lost child. Urged by him to choose one of her
  numerous suitors, she consented to do so, but made it a condition that he
  alone, who could outstrip her in the race, should become her husband,
  whilst those she defeated should be put to death by her, with the lance
  which she bore in her hand. Thus many suitors had perished, for the
  maiden was unequalled for swiftness of foot, but at last a beautiful
  youth, named Hippomenes, who had vainly endeavoured to win her love by
  his assiduous attentions in the chase, ventured to enter the fatal lists.
  Knowing that only by stratagem could he hope to be successful, he
  obtained, by the help of Aphrodite, three golden apples from the garden
  of the Hesperides, which he threw down at intervals during his course.
  Atalanta, secure of victory, stooped to pick up the tempting fruit, and,
  in the meantime, Hippomenes arrived at the goal. He became the husband of
  the lovely Atalanta, but forgot, in his newly found happiness, the
  gratitude which he owed to Aphrodite, and the goddess withdrew her favour
  from the pair. Not long after, the prediction which foretold misfortune
  to Atalanta, in the event of her marriage, was verified, for she and her
  husband, having strayed unsanctioned into a sacred grove of Zeus, were
  both transformed into lions.

  The trophies of the ever-memorable boar-hunt had been carried by
  Atalanta into Arcadia, and, for many centuries, the identical hide and
  enormous tusks of the Calydonian boar hung in the temple of Athene at
  Tegea. The tusks were afterwards conveyed to Rome, and shown there among
  other curiosities.

  A forcible instance of the manner in which Artemis resented any
  intrusion on her retirement, is seen in the fate which befell the famous
  hunter Actaeon, who happening one day to see Artemis and her attendants
  bathing, imprudently ventured to approach the spot. The goddess, incensed
  at his audacity, sprinkled him with water, and transformed him into a
  stag, whereupon he was torn in pieces and devoured by his own dogs.  !--

EPHESIAN ARTEMIS.

  The Ephesian Artemis, known to us as "Diana of the Ephesians," was a
  very ancient Asiatic divinity of Persian origin called Metra, a
  name="NtA_33" href="#Nt_33">[33] whose worship the Greek
  colonists found already established, when they first settled in Asia
  Minor, and whom they identified with their own Greek Artemis, though she
  really possessed but one single attribute in common with their home
  deity.

  Metra was a twofold divinity, and represented, in one phase of her
  character, all-pervading love; in the other she was the light of heaven;
  and as Artemis, in her character as Selene, was the only Greek female
  divinity who represented celestial light, the Greek settlers, according
  to their custom of fusing foreign deities into their own, seized at once
  upon this point of resemblance, and decided that Metra should henceforth
  be regarded as identical with Artemis.

  In her character as the love which pervades all nature, and penetrates
  everywhere, they believed her also to be present in the mysterious Realm
  of Shades, where she exercised her benign sway, replacing to a certain
  extent that ancient divinity Hecate, and partly usurping also the place
  of Persephone, as mistress of the lower world. Thus they believed that it
  was she who permitted the spirits of the departed to revisit the earth,
  in order to communicate with those they loved, and to give them timely
  warning of coming evil. In fact, this great, mighty, and omnipresent
  power of love, as embodied in the Ephesian Artemis, was believed by the
  great thinkers of old, to be the ruling spirit of the universe, and it
  was to her influence, that all the mysterious and beneficent workings of
  nature were ascribed.

  There was a magnificent temple erected to this divinity at Ephesus (a
  city of Asia Minor), which was ranked among the seven wonders of the
  world, and was unequalled in beauty and grandeur. The interior of this
   a
  name="page93">[93]edifice was adorned with statues and
  paintings, and contained one hundred and twenty-seven columns, sixty feet
  in height, each column having been placed there by a different king. The
  wealth deposited in this temple was enormous, and the goddess was here
  worshipped with particular awe and solemnity. In the interior of the
  edifice stood a statue of her, formed of ebony, with lions on her arms
  and turrets on her head, whilst a number of breasts indicated the
  fruitfulness of the earth and of nature. Ctesiphon was the principal
  architect of this world-renowned structure, which, however, was not
  entirely completed till two hundred and twenty years after the
  foundation-stone was laid. But the labour of centuries was destroyed in a
  single night; for a man called Herostratus, seized with the insane desire
  of making his name famous to all succeeding generations, set fire to it
  and completely destroyed it. a name="NtA_34"
  href="#Nt_34">[34] So great was the indignation and sorrow
  of the Ephesians at this calamity, that they enacted a law, forbidding
  the incendiary's name to be mentioned, thereby however, defeating their
  own object, for thus the name of Herostratus has been handed down to
  posterity, and will live as long as the memory of the famous temple of
  Ephesus.

BRAURONIAN ARTEMIS.

  In ancient times, the country which we now call the Crimea, was known
  by the name of the Taurica Chersonnesus. It was colonized by Greek
  settlers, who, finding that the Scythian inhabitants had a native
  divinity somewhat resembling their own Artemis, identified her with the
  huntress-goddess of the mother-country. The worship of this Taurian
  Artemis was attended with the most barbarous practices, for, in
  accordance with a law which she had enacted, all strangers, whether male
  or female, landing, or shipwrecked on her shores, were sacrificed upon
  her altars. It is supposed that this decree was  span
  class="pagenum">[94]issued by the Taurian
  goddess of Chastity, to protect the purity of her followers, by keeping
  them apart from foreign influences.

  The interesting story of Iphigenia, a priestess in the temple of
  Artemis at Tauris, forms the subject of one of Schiller's most beautiful
  plays. The circumstances occurred at the commencement of the Trojan war,
  and are as follows:       The fleet, collected by the Greeks for the
  siege of Troy, had assembled at Aulis, in B       otia, and was about to
  set sail, when Agamemnon, the commander-in-chief, had the misfortune to
  kill accidentally a stag which was grazing in a grove, sacred to Artemis.
  The offended goddess sent continuous calms that delayed the departure of
  the fleet, and Calchas, the soothsayer, who had accompanied the
  expedition, declared that nothing less than the sacrifice of Agamemnon's
  favorite daughter, Iphigenia, would appease the wrath of the goddess. At
  these words, the heroic heart of the brave leader sank within him, and he
  declared that rather than consent to so fearful an alternative, he would
  give up his share in the expedition and return to Argos. In this dilemma
  Odysseus and other great generals called a council to discuss the matter,
  and, after much deliberation, it was decided that private feeling must
  yield to the welfare of the state. For a long time the unhappy Agamemnon
  turned a deaf ear to their arguments, but at last they succeeded in
  persuading him that it was his duty to make the sacrifice. He,
  accordingly, despatched a messenger to his wife, Clytemnæstra, begging
  her to send Iphigenia to him, alleging as a pretext that the great hero
  Achilles desired to make her his wife. Rejoicing at the brilliant destiny
  which awaited her beautiful daughter, the fond mother at once obeyed the
  command, and sent her to Aulis. When the maiden arrived at her
  destination, and discovered, to her horror, the dreadful fate which
  awaited her, she threw herself in an agony of grief at her father's feet,
  and with sobs and tears entreated him to have mercy on her, and to spare
  her young life. But alas! her doom was sealed, and her now repentant and
   a
  name="page95">[95]heart-broken father was powerless to avert
  it. The unfortunate victim was bound to the altar, and already the fatal
  knife was raised to deal the death-blow, when suddenly Iphigenia
  disappeared from view, and in her place on the altar, lay a beautiful
  deer ready to be sacrificed. It was Artemis herself, who, pitying the
  youth and beauty of her victim, caused her to be conveyed in a cloud to
  Taurica, where she became one of her priestesses, and intrusted with the
  charge of her temple; a dignity, however, which necessitated the offering
  of those human sacrifices presented to Artemis.

  Many years passed away, during which time the long and wearisome siege
  of Troy had come to an end, and the brave Agamemnon had returned home to
  meet death at the hands of his wife and Aegisthus. But his daughter,
  Iphigenia, was still an exile from her native country, and continued to
  perform the terrible duties which her office involved. She had long given
  up all hopes of ever being restored to her friends, when one day two
  Greek strangers landed on Taurica's inhospitable shores. These were
  Orestes and Pylades, whose romantic attachment to each other has made
  their names synonymous for devoted self-sacrificing friendship. Orestes
  was Iphigenia's brother, and Pylades her cousin, and their object in
  undertaking an expedition fraught with so much peril, was to obtain the
  statue of the Taurian Artemis. Orestes, having incurred the anger of the
  Furies for avenging the murder of his father Agamemnon, was pursued by
  them wherever he went, until at last he was informed by the oracle of
  Delphi that, in order to pacify them, he must convey the image of the
  Taurian Artemis from Tauris to Attica. This he at once resolved to do,
  and accompanied by his faithful friend Pylades, who insisted on sharing
  the dangers of the undertaking, he set out for Taurica. But the
  unfortunate youths had hardly stepped on shore before they were seized by
  the natives, who, as usual, conveyed them for sacrifice to the temple of
  Artemis. Iphigenia, discovering that they were Greeks, though unaware of
  their near relationship to herself, thought the  span
  class="pagenum">[96]opportunity a favourable
  one for sending tidings of her existence to her native country, and,
  accordingly, requested one of the strangers to be the bearer of a letter
  from her to her family. A magnanimous dispute now arose between the
  friends, and each besought the other to accept the precious privilege of
  life and freedom. Pylades, at length overcome by the urgent entreaties of
  Orestes, agreed to be the bearer of the missive, but on looking more
  closely at the superscription, he observed, to his intense surprise, that
  it was addressed to Orestes. Hereupon an explanation followed; the
  brother and sister recognized each other, amid joyful tears and loving
  embraces, and assisted by her friends and kinsmen, Iphigenia escaped with
  them from a country where she had spent so many unhappy days, and
  witnessed so many scenes of horror and anguish.

  The fugitives, having contrived to obtain the image of the Taurian
  Artemis, carried it with them to Brauron in Attica. This divinity was
  henceforth known as the Brauronian Artemis, and the rites which had
  rendered her worship so infamous in Taurica were now introduced into
  Greece, and human victims bled freely under the sacrificial knife, both
  in Athens and Sparta. The revolting practice of offering human sacrifices
  to her, was continued until the time of Lycurgus, the great Spartan
  lawgiver, who put an end to it by substituting in its place one, which
  was hardly less barbarous, namely, the scourging of youths, who were
  whipped on the altars of the Brauronian Artemis in the most cruel manner;
  sometimes indeed they expired under the lash, in which case their
  mothers, far from lamenting their fate, are said to have rejoiced,
  considering this an honourable death for their sons.

SELENE-ARTEMIS.

  Hitherto we have seen Artemis only in the various phases of her
  terrestrial character; but just as her brother Apollo drew into himself
  by degrees the attributes of that more ancient divinity Helios, the
  sun-god, so, in like manner, she came to be identified in later times
   a
  name="page97">[97]with Selene, the moon-goddess, in which
  character she is always represented as wearing on her forehead a
  glittering crescent, whilst a flowing veil, bespangled with stars,
  reaches to her feet, and a long robe completely envelops her.

DIANA.

  The Diana of the Romans was identified with the Greek Artemis, with
  whom she shares that peculiar tripartite character, which so strongly
  marks the individuality of the Greek goddess. In heaven she was Luna (the
  moon), on earth Diana (the huntress-goddess), and in the lower world
  Proserpine; but, unlike the Ephesian Artemis, Diana, in her character as
  Proserpine, carries with her into the lower world no element of love or
  sympathy; she is, on the contrary, characterized by practices altogether
  hostile to man, such as the exercise of witchcraft, evil charms, and
  other antagonistic influences, and is, in fact, the Greek Hecate, in her
  later development.

  The statues of Diana were generally erected at a point where three
  roads met, for which reason she is called Trivia (from tri, three,
  and via, way).

  A temple was dedicated to her on the Aventine hill by Servius Tullius,
  who is said to have first introduced the worship of this divinity into
  Rome.

  The Nemoralia, or Grove Festivals, were celebrated in her honour on
  the 13th of August, on the Lacus Nemorensis, or forest-buried lake, near
  Aricia. The priest who officiated in her temple on this spot, was always
  a fugitive slave, who had gained his office by murdering his predecessor,
  and hence was constantly armed, in order that he might thus be prepared
  to encounter a new aspirant.

HEPHÆSTUS (Vulcan).

  Hephæstus, the son of Zeus and Hera, was the god of fire in its
  beneficial aspect, and the presiding deity over all workmanship
  accomplished by means of this useful element. He was universally
  honoured, not only as the  a
  name="page98">[98]god of all mechanical arts, but also as a
  house and hearth divinity, who exercised a beneficial influence on
  civilized society in general. Unlike the other Greek divinities, he was
  ugly and deformed, being awkward in his movements, and limping in his
  gait. This latter defect originated, as we have already seen, in the
  wrath of his father Zeus, who hurled him down from heaven a name="NtA_35"
  href="#Nt_35">[35] in consequence of his taking the part
  of Hera, in one of the domestic disagreements, which so frequently arose
  between this royal pair. Hephæstus was a whole day falling from Olympus
  to the earth, where he at length alighted on the island of Lemnos. The
  inhabitants of the country, seeing him descending through the air,
  received him in their arms; but in spite of their care, his leg was
  broken by the fall, and he remained ever afterwards lame in one foot.
  Grateful for the kindness of the Lemnians, he henceforth took up his
  abode in their island, and there built for himself a superb palace, and
  forges for the pursuit of his avocation. He instructed the people how to
  work in metals, and also taught them other valuable and useful arts.

  It is said that the first work of Hephæstus was a most ingenious
  throne of gold, with secret springs, which he presented to Hera. It was
  arranged in such a manner that, once seated, she found herself unable to
  move, and though all the gods endeavoured to extricate her, their efforts
  were unavailing. Hephæstus thus revenged himself on his mother for the
  cruelty she had always displayed towards him, on account of his want of
  comeliness and grace. Dionysus, the wine god, contrived, however, to
  intoxicate Hephæstus, and then induced him to return to Olympus, where,
  after having released the  a
  name="page99">[99]queen of heaven from her very undignified
  position, he became reconciled to his parents.

  He now built for himself a glorious palace on Olympus, of shining
  gold, and made for the other deities those magnificent edifices which
  they inhabited. He was assisted in his various and exquisitely skilful
  works of art, by two female statues of pure gold, formed by his own hand,
  which possessed the power of motion, and always accompanied him wherever
  he went. With the assistance of the Cyclops, he forged for Zeus his
  wonderful thunderbolts, thus investing his mighty father with a new power
  of terrible import. Zeus testified his appreciation of this precious
  gift, by bestowing upon Hephæstus the beautiful Aphrodite in marriage, a
  name="NtA_36" href="#Nt_36">[36] but this was a
  questionable boon; for the lovely Aphrodite, who was the personification
  of all grace and beauty, felt no affection for her ungainly and
  unattractive spouse, and amused herself by ridiculing his awkward
  movements and unsightly person. On one occasion especially, when
  Hephæstus good-naturedly took upon himself the office of cup-bearer to
  the gods, his hobbling gait and extreme awkwardness created the greatest
  mirth amongst the celestials, in which his disloyal partner was the first
  to join, with unconcealed merriment.

  Aphrodite greatly preferred Ares to her husband, and this preference
  naturally gave rise to much jealousy on the part of Hephæstus, and caused
  them great unhappiness.

  Hephæstus appears to have been an indispensable member of the Olympic
  Assembly, where he plays the part of smith, armourer, chariot-builder,
       c. As already mentioned, he constructed the palaces where the gods
  resided, fashioned the golden shoes with which they trod the air or
  water, built for them their wonderful chariots, and shod with brass the
  horses of celestial breed, which conveyed these glittering equipages over
  land and sea. He also made the tripods which moved of themselves in and
  out of the celestial halls, formed for Zeus the  span
  class="pagenum">[100]far-famed ægis, and
  erected the magnificent palace of the sun. He also created the
  brazen-footed bulls of Aetes, which breathed flames from their nostrils,
  sent forth clouds of smoke, and filled the air with their roaring.

  Among his most renowned works of art for the use of mortals were: the
  armour of Achilles and Æneas, the beautiful necklace of Harmonia, and the
  crown of Ariadne; but his masterpiece was Pandora, of whom a detailed
  account has already been given.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0100-1.png"
      alt="Hephæstus" title="Hephæstus" />
  
  There was a temple on Mount Etna erected in his honour, which none but
  the pure and virtuous were permitted to enter. The entrance to this
  temple was guarded by dogs, which possessed the extraordinary faculty of
  being able to discriminate between the righteous and the unrighteous,
  fawning upon and caressing the good, whilst they rushed upon all
  evil-doers and drove them away.

  Hephæstus is usually represented as a powerful, brawny, and very
  muscular man of middle height and mature age; his strong uplifted arm is
  raised in the act of striking the anvil with a hammer, which he holds in
  one hand, whilst with the other he is turning a thunderbolt, which an
  eagle beside him is waiting to carry to Zeus. The principal seat of his
  worship was the island of Lemnos, where he was regarded with peculiar
  veneration.

VULCAN.

  The Roman Vulcan was merely an importation from Greece, which never at
  any time took firm root in Rome, nor entered largely into the actual life
  and sympathies of the nation, his worship being unattended by the
  devotional feeling and enthusiasm which characterized the religious rites
  of the other deities. He still, however, retained in Rome his  !-- Page
  101 -->[101]Greek
  attributes as god of fire, and unrivalled master of the art of working in
  metals, and was ranked among the twelve great gods of Olympus, whose
  gilded statues were arranged consecutively along the Forum. His Roman
  name, Vulcan, would seem to indicate a connection with the first great
  metal-working artificer of Biblical history, Tubal-Cain.

POSEIDON (Neptune).

  Poseidon was the son of Kronos and Rhea, and the brother of Zeus. He
  was god of the sea, more particularly of the Mediterranean, and, like the
  element over which he presided, was of a variable disposition, now
  violently agitated, and now calm and placid, for which reason he is
  sometimes represented by the poets as quiet and composed, and at others
  as disturbed and angry.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0101-1.png"
      alt="Poseidon" title="Poseidon" />
  
  In the earliest ages of Greek mythology, he merely symbolized the
  watery element; but in later times, as navigation and intercourse with
  other nations engendered greater traffic by sea, Poseidon gained in
  importance, and came to be regarded as a distinct divinity, holding
  indisputable dominion over the sea, and over all sea-divinities, who
  acknowledged him as their sovereign ruler. He possessed the power of
  causing at will, mighty and destructive tempests, in which the billows
  rise mountains high, the wind becomes a hurricane, land and sea being
  enveloped in thick mists, whilst destruction assails the unfortunate
  mariners exposed to their fury. On the other hand, his alone was the
  power of stilling the angry  a
  name="page102">[102]waves, of soothing the troubled waters,
  and granting safe voyages to mariners. For this reason, Poseidon was
  always invoked and propitiated by a libation before a voyage was
  undertaken, and sacrifices and thanksgivings were gratefully offered to
  him after a safe and prosperous journey by sea.

  The symbol of his power was the fisherman's fork or trident, a
  name="NtA_37" href="#Nt_37">[37] by means of which he
  produced earthquakes, raised up islands from the bottom of the sea, and
  caused wells to spring forth out of the earth.

  Poseidon was essentially the presiding deity over fishermen, and was
  on that account, more particularly worshipped and revered in countries
  bordering on the sea-coast, where fish naturally formed a staple
  commodity of trade. He was supposed to vent his displeasure by sending
  disastrous inundations, which completely destroyed whole countries, and
  were usually accompanied by terrible marine monsters, who swallowed up
  and devoured those whom the floods had spared. It is probable that these
  sea-monsters are the poetical figures which represent the demons of
  hunger and famine, necessarily accompanying a general inundation.

  Poseidon is generally represented as resembling his brother Zeus in
  features, height, and general aspect; but we miss in the countenance of
  the sea-god the kindness and benignity which so pleasingly distinguish
  his mighty brother. The eyes are bright and piercing, and the contour of
  the face somewhat sharper in its outline than that of Zeus, thus
  corresponding, as it were, with his more angry and violent nature. His
  hair waves in dark, disorderly masses over his shoulders; his chest is
  broad, and his frame powerful and stalwart; he wears a short, curling
  beard, and a band round his head. He usually appears standing erect in a
  graceful shell-chariot, drawn by hippocamps, or sea-horses, with golden
  manes and brazen hoofs, who bound over the dancing waves with such
  wonderful swiftness, that the chariot scarcely touches  !-- Page 103
  -->[103]the water. The
  monsters of the deep, acknowledging their mighty lord, gambol playfully
  around him, whilst the sea joyfully smooths a path for the passage of its
  all-powerful ruler.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0103-1.png"
      alt="A hippocamp" title="A hippocamp" />
  
  He inhabited a beautiful palace at the bottom of the sea at Ægea in
  Eub       a, and also possessed a royal residence on Mount Olympus,
  which, however, he only visited when his presence was required at the
  council of the gods.

  His wonderful palace beneath the waters was of vast extent; in its
  lofty and capacious halls thousands of his followers could assemble. The
  exterior of the building was of bright gold, which the continual wash of
  the waters preserved untarnished; in the interior, lofty and graceful
  columns supported the gleaming dome. Everywhere fountains of glistening,
  silvery water played; everywhere groves and arbours of feathery-leaved
  sea-plants appeared, whilst rocks of pure crystal glistened with all the
  varied colours of the rainbow. Some of the paths were strewn with white
  sparkling sand, interspersed with jewels, pearls, and amber. This
  delightful abode was surrounded on all sides by wide fields, where there
  were whole groves of dark purple coralline, and tufts of beautiful
  scarlet-leaved plants, and sea-anemones of every tint. Here grew bright,
  pinky sea-weeds, mosses of all hues and shades, and tall grasses, which,
  growing upwards, formed emerald caves and grottoes such as the Nereides
  love, whilst fish of various kinds playfully darted in and out, in the
  full enjoyment of their native element. Nor was illumination wanting in
  this fairy-like region, which at night was lit up by the glow-worms of
  the deep.

  But although Poseidon ruled with absolute power over the ocean and its
  inhabitants, he nevertheless bowed submissively to the will of the great
  ruler of Olympus, and appeared at all times desirous of conciliating him.
  We  a
  name="page104">[104]find him coming to his aid when emergency
  demanded, and frequently rendering him valuable assistance against his
  opponents. At the time when Zeus was harassed by the attacks of the
  Giants, he proved himself a most powerful ally, engaging in single combat
  with a hideous giant named Polybotes, whom he followed over the sea, and
  at last succeeded in destroying, by hurling upon him the island of
  Cos.

  These amicable relations between the brothers were, however, sometimes
  interrupted. Thus, for instance, upon one occasion Poseidon joined Hera
  and Athene in a secret conspiracy to seize upon the ruler of heaven,
  place him in fetters, and deprive him of the sovereign power. The
  conspiracy being discovered, Hera, as the chief instigator of this
  sacrilegious attempt on the divine person of Zeus, was severely
  chastised, and even beaten, by her enraged spouse, as a punishment for
  her rebellion and treachery, whilst Poseidon was condemned, for the space
  of a whole year, to forego his dominion over the sea, and it was at this
  time that, in conjunction with Apollo, he built for Laomedon the walls of
  Troy.

  Poseidon married a sea-nymph named Amphitrite, whom he wooed under the
  form of a dolphin. She afterwards became jealous of a beautiful maiden
  called Scylla, who was beloved by Poseidon, and in order to revenge
  herself she threw some herbs into a well where Scylla was bathing, which
  had the effect of metamorphosing her into a monster of terrible aspect,
  having twelve feet, six heads with six long necks, and a voice which
  resembled the bark of a dog. This awful monster is said to have inhabited
  a cave at a very great height in the famous rock which still bears her
  name,[38] and was supposed
  to swoop down from her rocky eminence upon every ship that passed, and
  with each of her six heads to secure a victim.

  Amphitrite is often represented assisting Poseidon in attaching the
  sea-horses to his chariot.

[105]

  The Cyclops, who have been already alluded to in the history of
  Cronus, were the sons of Poseidon and Amphitrite. They were a wild race
  of gigantic growth, similar in their nature to the earth-born Giants, and
  had only one eye each in the middle of their foreheads. They led a
  lawless life, possessing neither social manners nor fear of the gods, and
  were the workmen of Hephæstus, whose workshop was supposed to be in the
  heart of the volcanic mountain Ætna.

  Here we have another striking instance of the manner in which the
  Greeks personified the powers of nature, which they saw in active
  operation around them. They beheld with awe, mingled with astonishment,
  the fire, stones, and ashes which poured forth from the summit of this
  and other volcanic mountains, and, with their vivacity of imagination,
  found a solution of the mystery in the supposition, that the god of Fire
  must be busy at work with his men in the depths of the earth, and that
  the mighty flames which they beheld, issued in this manner from his
  subterranean forge.

  The chief representative of the Cyclops was the man-eating monster
  Polyphemus, described by Homer as having been blinded and outwitted at
  last by Odysseus. This monster fell in love with a beautiful nymph called
  Galatea; but, as may be supposed, his addresses were not acceptable to
  the fair maiden, who rejected them in favour of a youth named Acis, upon
  which Polyphemus, with his usual barbarity, destroyed the life of his
  rival by throwing upon him a gigantic rock. The blood of the murdered
  Acis, gushing out of the rock, formed a stream which still bears his
  name.

  Triton, Rhoda,[39] and
  Benthesicyme were also children of Poseidon and Amphitrite.

  The sea-god was the father of two giant sons called Otus and
  Ephialtes.[40] When only
  nine years old they  a
  name="page106">[106]were said to be twenty-seven cubits a
  name="NtA_41" href="#Nt_41">[41] in height and nine in
  breadth. These youthful giants were as rebellious as they were powerful,
  even presuming to threaten the gods themselves with hostilities. During
  the war of the Gigantomachia, they endeavoured to scale heaven by piling
  mighty mountains one upon another. Already had they succeeded in placing
  Mount Ossa on Olympus and Pelion on Ossa, when this impious project was
  frustrated by Apollo, who destroyed them with his arrows. It was supposed
  that had not their lives been thus cut off before reaching maturity,
  their sacrilegious designs would have been carried into effect.

  Pelias and Neleus were also sons of Poseidon. Their mother Tyro was
  attached to the river-god Enipeus, whose form Poseidon assumed, and thus
  won her love. Pelias became afterwards famous in the story of the
  Argonauts, and Neleus was the father of Nestor, who was distinguished in
  the Trojan War.

  The Greeks believed that it was to Poseidon they were indebted for the
  existence of the horse, which he is said to have produced in the
  following manner: Athene and Poseidon both claiming the right to name
  Cecropia (the ancient name of Athens), a violent dispute arose, which was
  finally settled by an assembly of the Olympian gods, who decided that
  whichever of the contending parties presented mankind with the most
  useful gift, should obtain the privilege of naming the city. Upon this
  Poseidon struck the ground with his trident, and the horse sprang forth
  in all his untamed strength and graceful beauty. From the spot which
  Athene touched with her wand, issued the olive-tree, whereupon the gods
  unanimously awarded to her the victory, declaring her gift to be the
  emblem of peace and plenty, whilst that of Poseidon was thought to be the
  symbol of war and  a
  name="page107">[107]bloodshed. Athene accordingly called the
  city Athens, after herself, and it has ever since retained this name.

  Poseidon tamed the horse for the use of mankind, and was believed to
  have taught men the art of managing horses by the bridle. The Isthmian
  games (so named because they were held on the Isthmus of Corinth), in
  which horse and chariot races were a distinguishing feature, were
  instituted in honour of Poseidon.

  He was more especially worshipped in the Peloponnesus, though
  universally revered throughout Greece and in the south of Italy. His
  sacrifices were generally black and white bulls, also wild boars and
  rams. His usual attributes are the trident, horse, and dolphin.

  In some parts of Greece this divinity was identified with the sea-god
  Nereus, for which reason the Nereides, or daughters of Nereus, are
  represented as accompanying him.

NEPTUNE.

  The Romans worshipped Poseidon under the name of Neptune, and invested
  him with all the attributes which belong to the Greek divinity.

  The Roman commanders never undertook any naval expedition without
  propitiating Neptune by a sacrifice.

  His temple at Rome was in the Campus Martius, and the festivals
  commemorated in his honour were called Neptunalia.



SEA DIVINITIES.

OCEANUS.

  Oceanus was the son of Uranus and Gæa. He was the personification of
  the ever-flowing stream, which, according to the primitive notions of the
  early Greeks, encircled the world, and from which sprang all the rivers
  and streams that watered the earth. He was married to Tethys, one of the
  Titans, and was the father of a  a
  name="page108">[108]numerous progeny called the Oceanides, who
  are said to have been three thousand in number. He alone, of all the
  Titans, refrained from taking part against Zeus in the Titanomachia, and
  was, on that account, the only one of the primeval divinities permitted
  to retain his dominion under the new dynasty.

NEREUS.

  Nereus appears to have been the personification of the sea in its calm
  and placid moods, and was, after Poseidon, the most important of the
  sea-deities. He is represented as a kind and benevolent old man,
  possessing the gift of prophecy, and presiding more particularly over the
  Ægean Sea, of which he was considered to be the protecting spirit. There
  he dwelt with his wife Doris and their fifty blooming daughters, the
  Nereides, beneath the waves in a beautiful grotto-palace, and was ever
  ready to assist distressed mariners in the hour of danger.

PROTEUS.

  Proteus, more familiarly known as "The Old Man of the Sea," was a son
  of Poseidon, and gifted with prophetic power. But he had an invincible
  objection to being consulted in his capacity as seer, and those who
  wished him to foretell events, watched for the hour of noon, when he was
  in the habit of coming up to the island of Pharos, a name="NtA_42"
  href="#Nt_42">[42] with Poseidon's flock of seals, which
  he tended at the bottom of the sea. Surrounded by these creatures of the
  deep, he used to slumber beneath the grateful shade of the rocks. This
  was the favourable moment to seize the prophet, who, in order to avoid
  importunities, would change himself into an infinite variety of forms.
  But patience gained the day; for if he were only held long enough, he
  became wearied at last, and, resuming his true form, gave the information
  desired, after which he dived down again to the bottom of the sea,
  accompanied by the animals he tended.

TRITON and the TRITONS.

  Triton was the only son of Poseidon and Amphitrite, but he possessed
  little influence, being altogether a minor divinity. He is usually
  represented as preceding his father and acting as his trumpeter, using a
  conch-shell for this purpose. He lived with his parents in their
  beautiful golden palace beneath the sea at Ægea, and his favourite
  pastime was to ride over the billows on horses or sea-monsters. Triton is
  always represented as half man, half fish, the body below the waist
  terminating in the tail of a dolphin. We frequently find mention of
  Tritons who are either the offspring or kindred of Triton.

GLAUCUS.

  Glaucus is said to have become a sea-divinity in the following manner.
  While angling one day, he observed that the fish he caught and threw on
  the bank, at once nibbled at the grass and then leaped back into the
  water. His curiosity was naturally excited, and he proceeded to gratify
  it by taking up a few blades and tasting them. No sooner was this done
  than, obeying an irresistible impulse, he precipitated himself into the
  deep, and became a sea-god.

  Like most sea-divinities he was gifted with prophetic power, and each
  year visited all the islands and coasts with a train of marine monsters,
  foretelling all kinds of evil. Hence fishermen dreaded his approach, and
  endeavoured, by prayer and fasting, to avert the misfortunes which he
  prophesied. He is often represented floating on the billows, his body
  covered with mussels, sea-weed, and shells, wearing a full beard and long
  flowing hair, and bitterly bewailing his immortality.

[110]

THETIS.

  The silver-footed, fair-haired Thetis, who plays an important part in
  the mythology of Greece, was the daughter of Nereus, or, as some assert,
  of Poseidon. Her grace and beauty were so remarkable that Zeus and
  Poseidon both sought an alliance with her; but, as it had been foretold
  that a son of hers would gain supremacy over his father, they
  relinquished their intentions, and she became the wife of Peleus, son of
  Æacus. Like Proteus, Thetis possessed the power of transforming herself
  into a variety of different shapes, and when wooed by Peleus she exerted
  this power in order to elude him. But, knowing that persistence would
  eventually succeed, he held her fast until she assumed her true form.
  Their nuptials were celebrated with the utmost pomp and magnificence, and
  were honoured by the presence of all the gods and goddesses, with the
  exception of Eris. How the goddess of discord resented her exclusion from
  the marriage festivities has already been shown.

  Thetis ever retained great influence over the mighty lord of heaven,
  which, as we shall see hereafter, she used in favour of her renowned son,
  Achilles, in the Trojan War.

  When Halcyone plunged into the sea in despair after the shipwreck and
  death of her husband King Ceyx, Thetis transformed both husband and wife
  into the birds called kingfishers (halcyones), which, with the tender
  affection which characterized the unfortunate couple, always fly in
  pairs. The idea of the ancients was that these birds brought forth their
  young in nests, which float on the surface of the sea in calm weather,
  before and after the shortest day, when Thetis was said to keep the
  waters smooth and tranquil for their especial benefit; hence the term
  "halcyon-days," which signifies a period of rest and untroubled
  felicity.

[111]

THAUMAS, PHORCYS, and CETO.

  The early Greeks, with their extraordinary power of personifying all
  and every attribute of Nature, gave a distinct personality to those
  mighty wonders of the deep, which, in all ages, have afforded matter of
  speculation to educated and uneducated alike. Among these
  personifications we find Thaumas, Phorcys, and their sister Ceto, who
  were the offspring of Pontus.

  Thaumas (whose name signifies Wonder) typifies that peculiar,
  translucent condition of the surface of the sea when it reflects,
  mirror-like, various images, and appears to hold in its transparent
  embrace the flaming stars and illuminated cities, which are so frequently
  reflected on its glassy bosom.

  Thaumas married the lovely Electra (whose name signifies the sparkling
  light produced by electricity), daughter of Oceanus. Her amber-coloured
  hair was of such rare beauty that none of her fair-haired sisters could
  compare with her, and when she wept, her tears, being too precious to be
  lost, formed drops of shining amber.

  Phorcys and Ceto personified more especially the hidden perils and
  terrors of the ocean. They were the parents of the Gorgons, the Græa, and
  the Dragon which guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0112-1.png"
      alt="A Siren" title="A Siren" />
  
LEUCOTHEA.

  Leucothea was originally a mortal named Ino, daughter of Cadmus, king
  of Thebes. She married Athamas, king of Orchomenus, who, incensed at her
  unnatural conduct to her step-children, a name="NtA_43"
  href="#Nt_43">[43] pursued her and her son to the
  sea-shore, when, seeing no hope of escape, she flung herself with her
  child into the deep. They were kindly received by the Nereides, and
  became sea-divinities under the name of Leucothea and Palæmon.

[112]

THE SIRENS.

  The Sirens would appear to have been personifications of those
  numerous rocks and unseen dangers, which abound on the S.W. coast of
  Italy. They were sea-nymphs, with the upper part of the body that of a
  maiden and the lower that of a sea-bird, having wings attached to their
  shoulders, and were endowed with such wonderful voices, that their sweet
  songs are said to have lured mariners to destruction.

ARES (Mars).

  Ares, the son of Zeus and Hera, was the god of war, who gloried in
  strife for its own sake; he loved the tumult and havoc of the
  battlefield, and delighted in slaughter and extermination; in fact he
  presents no benevolent aspect which could possibly react favourably upon
  human life.

  Epic poets, in particular, represent the god of battles as a wild
  ungovernable warrior, who passes through the armies like a whirlwind,
  hurling to the ground the brave and cowardly alike; destroying chariots
  and helmets, and triumphing over the terrible desolation which he
  produces.

  In all the myths concerning Ares, his sister Athene ever appears in
  opposition to him, endeavouring by every means in her power to defeat his
  bloodthirsty designs. Thus she assists the divine hero Diomedes at the
  siege of Troy, to overcome Ares in battle, and so well does he profit by
  her timely aid, that he succeeds in wounding the sanguinary war-god, who
  makes his exit from the field, roaring like ten thousand bulls.

[113]

  Ares appears to have been an object of aversion to all the gods of
  Olympus, Aphrodite alone excepted. As the son of Hera, he had inherited
  from his mother the strongest feelings of independence and contradiction,
  and as he took delight in upsetting that peaceful course of state-life
  which it was pre-eminently the care of Zeus to establish, he was
  naturally disliked and even hated by him.

  When wounded by Diomedes, as above related, he complains to his
  father, but receives no sympathy from the otherwise kindly and beneficent
  ruler of Olympus, who thus angrily addresses him: "Do not trouble me with
  thy complaints, thou who art of all the gods of Olympus most hateful to
  me, for thou delightest in nought save war and strife. The very spirit of
  thy mother lives in thee, and wert thou not my son, long ago wouldst thou
  have lain deeper down in the bowels of the earth than the son of
  Uranus."

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0114-1.png"
      alt="Ares" title="Ares" />
  
  Ares, upon one occasion, incurred the anger of Poseidon by slaying his
  son Halirrhothios, who had insulted Alcippe, the daughter of the war-god.
  For this deed, Poseidon summoned Ares to appear before the tribunal of
  the Olympic gods, which was held upon a hill in Athens. Ares was
  acquitted, and this event is supposed to have given rise to the name
  Areopagus (or Hill of Ares), which afterwards became so famous as a court
  of justice. In the Gigantomachia, Ares was defeated by the Aloidæ, the
  two giant-sons of Poseidon, who put him in chains, and kept him in prison
  for thirteen months.

  Ares is represented as a man of youthful appearance; his tall muscular
  form combines great strength with wonderful agility. In his right hand he
  bears a sword or a mighty lance, while on the left arm he carries his
  round shield (see next page). His demoniacal surroundings are Terror and
  Fear;[44] Enyo, the goddess
  of the war-cry; Keidomos, the demon of the noise of battles; and Eris
  (Contention), his twin-sister and companion, who always  !-- Page 114
  -->[114]precedes his
  chariot when he rushes to the fight, the latter being evidently a simile
  of the poets to express the fact that war follows contention.

  Eris is represented as a woman of florid complexion, with dishevelled
  hair, and her whole appearance angry and menacing. In one hand she
  brandishes a poniard and a hissing adder, whilst in the other she carries
  a burning torch. Her dress is torn and disorderly, and her hair
  intertwined with venomous snakes. This divinity was never invoked by
  mortals, except when they desired her assistance for the accomplishment
  of evil purposes.

MARS.

  The Roman divinity most closely resembling the Greek Ares, and
  identified with him, was called Mars, Mamers, and Marspiter or Father
  Mars.

  The earliest Italian tribes, who were mostly engaged in the pursuit of
  husbandry, regarded this deity more especially as the god of spring, who
  vanquished the powers of winter, and encouraged the peaceful arts of
  agriculture. But with the Romans, who were an essentially warlike nation,
  Mars gradually loses his peaceful character, and, as god of war, attains,
  after Jupiter, the highest position among the Olympic gods. The Romans
  looked upon him as their special protector, and declared him to have been
  the father of Romulus and Remus, the founders of their city. But although
  he was especially  a
  name="page115">[115]worshipped in Rome as god of war, he still
  continued to preside over agriculture, and was also the protecting deity
  who watched over the welfare of the state.

  As the god who strode with warlike step to the battlefield, he was
  called Gradivus (from gradus, a step), it being popularly believed
  by the Romans that he himself marched before them to battle, and acted as
  their invisible protector. As the presiding deity over agriculture, he
  was styled Sylvanus, whilst in his character as guardian of the state, he
  bore the name of Quirinus. a name="NtA_45"
  href="#Nt_45">[45]

  The priests of Mars were twelve in number, and were called Salii, or
  the dancers, from the fact that sacred dances, in full armour, formed an
  important item in their peculiar ceremonial. This religious order, the
  members of which were always chosen from the noblest families in Rome,
  was first instituted by Numa Pompilius, who intrusted to their special
  charge the Anciliæ, or sacred shields. It is said that one morning, when
  Numa was imploring the protection of Jupiter for the newly-founded city
  of Rome, the god of heaven, as though in answer to his prayer, sent down
  an oblong brazen shield, and, as it fell at the feet of the king, a voice
  was heard announcing that on its preservation depended the future safety
  and prosperity of Rome. In order, therefore, to lessen the chances of
  this sacred treasure being abstracted, Numa caused eleven more to be made
  exactly like it, which were then given into the care of the Salii.

  The assistance and protection of the god of war was always solemnly
  invoked before the departure of a Roman army for the field of battle, and
  any reverses of fortune were invariably ascribed to his anger, which was
  accordingly propitiated by means of extraordinary sin-offerings and
  prayers.

  In Rome a field, called the Campus Martius, was dedicated to Mars. It
  was a large, open space, in which armies were collected and reviewed,
  general assemblies of  a
  name="page116">[116]the people held, and the young nobility
  trained to martial exercises.

  The most celebrated and magnificent of the numerous temples built by
  the Romans in honour of this deity was the one erected by Augustus in the
  Forum, to commemorate the overthrow of the murderers of Cæsar.

  Of all existing statues of Mars the most renowned is that in the Villa
  Ludovisi at Rome, in which he is represented as a powerful, muscular man
  in the full vigour of youth. The attitude is that of thoughtful repose,
  but the short, curly hair, dilated nostrils, and strongly marked features
  leave no doubt as to the force and turbulence of his character. At his
  feet, the sculptor has placed the little god of love, who looks up all
  undaunted at the mighty war-god, as though mischievously conscious that
  this unusually quiet mood is attributable to his influence.

  Religious festivals in honour of Mars were generally held in the month
  of March; but he had also a festival on the Ides of October, when
  chariot-races took place, after which, the right-hand horse of the team
  which had drawn the victorious chariot, was sacrificed to him. In ancient
  times, human sacrifices, more especially prisoners of war, were offered
  to him; but, at a later period, this cruel practice was discontinued.

  The attributes of this divinity are the helmet, shield, and spear. The
  animals consecrated to him were the wolf, horse, vulture, and
  woodpecker.

  Intimately associated with Mars in his character as god of war, was a
  goddess called BELLONA, who was evidently the female divinity of
  battle with one or other of the primitive nations of Italy (most probably
  the Sabines), and is usually seen accompanying Mars, whose war-chariot
  she guides. Bellona appears on the battle-field, inspired with mad rage,
  cruelty, and the love of extermination. She is in full armour, her hair
  is dishevelled, and she bears a scourge in one hand, and a lance in the
  other.

  A temple was erected to her on the Campus Martius. Before the entrance
  to this edifice stood a pillar, over which a spear was thrown when war
  was publicly declared.  a
  name="page117">[117]

NIKE (Victoria).

  Nike, the goddess of victory, was the daughter of the Titan Pallas,
  and of Styx, the presiding nymph of the river of that name in the lower
  world.

  In her statues, Nike somewhat resembles Athene, but may easily be
  recognized by her large, graceful wings and flowing drapery, which is
  negligently fastened on the right shoulder, and only partially conceals
  her lovely form. In her left hand, she holds aloft a crown of laurel, and
  in the right, a palm-branch. In ancient sculpture, Nike is usually
  represented in connection with colossal statues of Zeus or Pallas-Athene,
  in which case she is life-sized, and stands on a ball, held in the open
  palm of the deity she accompanies. Sometimes she is represented engaged
  in inscribing the victory of a conqueror on his shield, her right foot
  being slightly raised and placed on a ball.

  A celebrated temple was erected to this divinity on the Acropolis at
  Athens, which is still to be seen, and is in excellent preservation.

VICTORIA.

  Under the name of Victoria, Nike was highly honoured by the Romans,
  with whom love of conquest was an all-absorbing characteristic. There
  were several sanctuaries in Rome dedicated to her, the principal of which
  was on the Capitol, where it was the custom of generals, after success
  had attended their arms, to erect statues of the goddess in commemoration
  of their victories. The most magnificent of these statues, was that
  raised by Augustus after the battle of Actium. A festival was celebrated
  in honour of Nike on the 12th of April.

HERMES (Mercury).

  Hermes was the swift-footed messenger, and trusted ambassador of all
  the gods, and conductor of shades to Hades. He presided over the rearing
  and education of  a
  name="page118">[118]the young, and encouraged gymnastic
  exercises and athletic pursuits, for which reason, all gymnasiums and
  wrestling schools throughout Greece were adorned with his statues. He is
  said to have invented the alphabet, and to have taught the art of
  interpreting foreign languages, and his versatility, sagacity, and
  cunning were so extraordinary, that Zeus invariably chose him as his
  attendant, when, disguised as a mortal, he journeyed on earth.

  Hermes was worshipped as god of eloquence, most probably from the fact
  that, in his office as ambassador, this faculty was indispensable to the
  successful issue of the negotiations with which he was intrusted. He was
  regarded as the god who granted increase and prosperity to flocks and
  herds, and, on this account, was worshipped with special veneration by
  herdsmen.

  In ancient times, trade was conducted chiefly by means of the exchange
  of cattle. Hermes, therefore, as god of herdsmen, came to be regarded as
  the protector of merchants, and, as ready wit and adroitness are valuable
  qualities both in buying and selling, he was also looked upon as the
  patron of artifice and cunning. Indeed, so deeply was this notion rooted
  in the minds of the Greek people, that he was popularly believed to be
  also god of thieves, and of all persons who live by their wits.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0118-1.png"
      alt="A Herma" title="A Herma" />
  
  As the patron of commerce, Hermes was naturally supposed to be the
  promoter of intercourse among nations; hence, he is essentially the god
  of travellers, over whose safety he presided, and he severely punished
  those who refused assistance to the lost or weary wayfarer. He was also
  guardian of streets and roads, and his statues, called Hermæ (which were
  pillars of stone surmounted by a head of Hermes), were placed at
  cross-roads, and frequently in streets and public squares.

  Being the god of all undertakings in which gain was a feature, he was
  worshipped as the giver of wealth and  span
  class="pagenum">[119]good luck, and any
  unexpected stroke of fortune was attributed to his influence. He also
  presided over the game of dice, in which he is said to have been
  instructed by Apollo.

  Hermes was the son of Zeus and Maia, the eldest and most beautiful of
  the seven Pleiades (daughters of Atlas), and was born in a cave of Mount
  Cyllene in Arcadia. As a mere babe, he exhibited an extraordinary faculty
  for cunning and dissimulation; in fact, he was a thief from his cradle,
  for, not many hours after his birth, we find him creeping stealthily out
  of the cave in which he was born, in order to steal some oxen belonging
  to his brother Apollo, who was at this time feeding the flocks of
  Admetus. But he had not proceeded very far on his expedition before he
  found a tortoise, which he killed, and, stretching seven strings across
  the empty shell, invented a lyre, upon which he at once began to play
  with exquisite skill. When he had sufficiently amused himself with the
  instrument, he placed it in his cradle, and then resumed his journey to
  Pieria, where the cattle of Admetus were grazing. Arriving at sunset at
  his destination, he succeeded in separating fifty oxen from his brother's
  herd, which he now drove before him, taking the precaution to cover his
  feet with sandals made of twigs of myrtle, in order to escape detection.
  But the little rogue was not unobserved, for the theft had been witnessed
  by an old shepherd named Battus, who was tending the flocks of Neleus,
  king of Pylos (father of Nestor). Hermes, frightened at being discovered,
  bribed him with the finest cow in the herd not to betray him, and Battus
  promised to keep the secret. But Hermes, astute as he was dishonest,
  determined to test the shepherd's integrity. Feigning to go away, he
  assumed the form of Admetus, and then returning to the spot offered the
  old man two of his best oxen if he would disclose the author of the
  theft. The ruse succeeded, for the avaricious shepherd, unable to resist
  the tempting bait, gave the desired information, upon which Hermes,
  exerting his divine power, changed him into a lump of touchstone, as a
   a
  name="page120">[120]punishment for his treachery and avarice.
  Hermes now killed two of the oxen, which he sacrificed to himself and the
  other gods, concealing the remainder in the cave. He then carefully
  extinguished the fire, and, after throwing his twig shoes into the river
  Alpheus, returned to Cyllene.

  Apollo, by means of his all-seeing power, soon discovered who it was
  that had robbed him, and hastening to Cyllene, demanded restitution of
  his property. On his complaining to Maia of her son's conduct, she
  pointed to the innocent babe then lying, apparently fast asleep, in his
  cradle, whereupon, Apollo angrily aroused the pretended sleeper, and
  charged him with the theft; but the child stoutly denied all knowledge of
  it, and so cleverly did he play his part, that he even inquired in the
  most naive manner what sort of animals cows were. Apollo threatened to
  throw him into Tartarus if he would not confess the truth, but all to no
  purpose. At last, he seized the babe in his arms, and brought him into
  the presence of his august father, who was seated in the council chamber
  of the gods. Zeus listened to the charge made by Apollo, and then sternly
  desired Hermes to say where he had hidden the cattle. The child, who was
  still in swaddling-clothes, looked up bravely into his father's face and
  said, "Now, do I look capable of driving away a herd of cattle; I, who
  was only born yesterday, and whose feet are much too soft and tender to
  tread in rough places? Until this moment, I lay in sweet sleep on my
  mother's bosom, and have never even crossed the threshold of our
  dwelling. You know well that I am not guilty; but, if you wish, I will
  affirm it by the most solemn oaths." As the child stood before him,
  looking the picture of innocence, Zeus could not refrain from smiling at
  his cleverness and cunning, but, being perfectly aware of his guilt, he
  commanded him to conduct Apollo to the cave where he had concealed the
  herd, and Hermes, seeing that further subterfuge was useless,
  unhesitatingly obeyed. But when the divine shepherd was about to drive
  his cattle back into Pieria, Hermes, as though by chance, touched the
  chords of his  a
  name="page121">[121]lyre. Hitherto Apollo had heard nothing
  but the music of his own three-stringed lyre and the syrinx, or Pan's
  pipe, and, as he listened entranced to the delightful strains of this new
  instrument, his longing to possess it became so great, that he gladly
  offered the oxen in exchange, promising at the same time, to give Hermes
  full dominion over flocks and herds, as well as over horses, and all the
  wild animals of the woods and forests. The offer was accepted, and, a
  reconciliation being thus effected between the brothers, Hermes became
  henceforth god of herdsmen, whilst Apollo devoted himself
  enthusiastically to the art of music.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0121-1.png"
      alt="Caduceus" title="Caduceus" />
  
  They now proceeded together to Olympus, where Apollo introduced Hermes
  as his chosen friend and companion, and, having made him swear by the
  Styx, that he would never steal his lyre or bow, nor invade his sanctuary
  at Delphi, he presented him with the Caduceus, or golden wand. This wand
  was surmounted by wings, and on presenting it to Hermes, Apollo informed
  him that it possessed the faculty of uniting in love, all beings divided
  by hate. Wishing to prove the truth of this assertion, Hermes threw it
  down between two snakes which were fighting, whereupon the angry
  combatants clasped each other in a loving embrace, and curling round the
  staff, remained ever after permanently attached to it. The wand itself
  typified power; the serpents, wisdom; and the wings, despatch       all
  qualities characteristic of a trustworthy ambassador.

  The young god was now presented by his father with a winged silver cap
  (Petasus), and also with silver wings for his feet (Talaria), and was
  forthwith appointed herald of the gods, and conductor of shades to Hades,
  which office had hitherto been filled by Aïdes.

  As messenger of the gods, we find him employed on all occasions
  requiring special skill, tact, or despatch. Thus he conducts Hera,
  Athene, and Aphrodite to Paris, leads Priam to Achilles to demand the
  body of Hector,  a
  name="page122">[122]binds Prometheus to Mount Caucasus,
  secures Ixion to the eternally revolving wheel, destroys Argus, the
  hundred-eyed guardian of Io,      c.      c.

  As conductor of shades, Hermes was always invoked by the dying to
  grant them a safe and speedy passage across the Styx. He also possessed
  the power of bringing back departed spirits to the upper world, and was,
  therefore, the mediator between the living and the dead.

  The poets relate many amusing stories of the youthful tricks played by
  this mischief-loving god upon the other immortals. For instance, he had
  the audacity to extract the Medusa's head from the shield of Athene,
  which he playfully attached to the back of Hephæstus; he also stole the
  girdle of Aphrodite; deprived Artemis of her arrows, and Ares of his
  spear, but these acts were always performed with such graceful dexterity,
  combined with such perfect good humour, that even the gods and goddesses
  he thus provoked, were fain to pardon him, and he became a universal
  favourite with them all.

  It is said that Hermes was one day flying over Athens, when, looking
  down into the city, he beheld a number of maidens returning in solemn
  procession from the temple of Pallas-Athene. Foremost among them was
  Herse, the beautiful daughter of king Cecrops, and Hermes was so struck
  with her exceeding loveliness that he determined to seek an interview
  with her. He accordingly presented himself at the royal palace, and
  begged her sister Agraulos to favour his suit; but, being of an
  avaricious turn of mind, she refused to do so without the payment of an
  enormous sum of money. It did not take the messenger of the gods long to
  obtain the means of fulfilling this condition, and he soon returned with
  a well-filled purse. But meanwhile Athene, to punish the cupidity of
  Agraulos, had caused the demon of envy to take possession of her, and the
  consequence was, that, being unable to contemplate the happiness of her
  sister, she sat down before the door, and resolutely refused to allow
  Hermes to enter. He tried every persuasion and blandishment in his power,
  but she still remained obstinate. At last, his patience  !-- Page 123
  -->[123]being
  exhausted, he changed her into a mass of black stone, and, the obstacle
  to his wishes being removed, he succeeded in persuading Herse to become
  his wife.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0123-1.png"
      alt="Hermes" title="Hermes" />
  
  In his statues, Hermes is represented as a beardless youth, with broad
  chest and graceful but muscular limbs; the face is handsome and
  intelligent, and a genial smile of kindly benevolence plays round the
  delicately chiselled lips.

  As messenger of the gods he wears the Petasus and Talaria, and bears
  in his hand the Caduceus or herald's staff.

  As god of eloquence, he is often represented with chains of gold
  hanging from his lips, whilst, as the patron of merchants, he bears a
  purse in his hand.

  The wonderful excavations in Olympia, to which allusion has already
  been made, have brought to light an exquisite marble group of Hermes and
  the infant Bacchus, by Praxiteles. In this great work of art, Hermes is
  represented as a young and handsome man, who is looking down kindly and
  affectionately at the child resting on his arm, but unfortunately nothing
  remains of the infant save the right hand, which is laid lovingly on the
  shoulder of his protector.

  The sacrifices to Hermes consisted of incense, honey, cakes, pigs, and
  especially lambs and young goats. As god of eloquence, the tongues of
  animals were sacrificed to him.

MERCURY.

  Mercury was the Roman god of commerce and gain. We find mention of a
  temple having been erected to him  span
  class="pagenum">[124]near the Circus Maximus
  as early as B.C. 495; and he had also a temple
  and a sacred fount near the Porta Capena. Magic powers were ascribed to
  the latter, and on the festival of Mercury, which took place on the 25th
  of May, it was the custom for merchants to sprinkle themselves and their
  merchandise with this holy water, in order to insure large profits from
  their wares.

  The Fetiales (Roman priests whose duty it was to act as guardians of
  the public faith) refused to recognize the identity of Mercury with
  Hermes, and ordered him to be represented with a sacred branch as the
  emblem of peace, instead of the Caduceus. In later times, however, he was
  completely identified with the Greek Hermes.

DIONYSUS (Bacchus).

  Dionysus, also called Bacchus (from bacca, berry), was the god
  of wine, and the personification of the blessings of Nature in
  general.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0124-1.png"
      alt="Dionysus" title="Dionysus" />
  
  The worship of this divinity, which is supposed to have been
  introduced into Greece from Asia (in all probability from India), first
  took root in Thrace, whence it gradually spread into other parts of
  Greece.

  Dionysus was the son of Zeus and Semele, and was snatched by Zeus from
  the devouring flames in which his mother perished, when he appeared to
  her in all the splendour of his divine glory. The motherless child was
  intrusted to the charge of Hermes, who conveyed him to Semele's sister,
  Ino. But Hera, still implacable in her vengeance, visited Athamas, the
  husband of Ino, with madness,  a
  name="page125">[125]and the child's life being no longer safe,
  he was transferred to the fostering care of the nymphs of Mount Nysa. An
  aged satyr named Silenus, the son of Pan, took upon himself the office of
  guardian and preceptor to the young god, who, in his turn, became much
  attached to his kind tutor; hence we see Silenus always figuring as one
  of the chief personages in the various expeditions of the wine-god.

  Dionysus passed an innocent and uneventful childhood, roaming through
  the woods and forests, surrounded by nymphs, satyrs, and shepherds.
  During one of these rambles, he found a fruit growing wild, of a most
  refreshing and cooling nature. This was the vine, from which he
  subsequently learnt to extract a juice which formed a most exhilarating
  beverage. After his companions had partaken freely of it, they felt their
  whole being pervaded by an unwonted sense of pleasurable excitement, and
  gave full vent to their overflowing exuberance, by shouting, singing, and
  dancing. Their numbers were soon swelled by a crowd, eager to taste a
  beverage productive of such extraordinary results, and anxious to join in
  the worship of a divinity to whom they were indebted for this new
  enjoyment. Dionysus, on his part, seeing how agreeably his discovery had
  affected his immediate followers, resolved to extend the boon to mankind
  in general. He saw that wine, used in moderation, would enable man to
  enjoy a happier, and more sociable existence, and that, under its
  invigorating influence, the sorrowful might, for a while, forget their
  grief and the sick their pain. He accordingly gathered round him his
  zealous followers, and they set forth on their travels, planting the vine
  and teaching its cultivation wherever they went.

  We now behold Dionysus at the head of a large army composed of men,
  women, fauns, and satyrs, all bearing in their hands the Thyrsus (a staff
  entwined with vine-branches surmounted by a fir-cone), and clashing
  together cymbals and other musical instruments. Seated in a chariot drawn
  by panthers, and accompanied by thousands of enthusiastic followers,
  Dionysus made a triumphal  a
  name="page126">[126]progress through Syria, Egypt, Arabia,
  India,      c., conquering all before him, founding cities, and
  establishing on every side a more civilized and sociable mode of life
  among the inhabitants of the various countries through which he
  passed.

  When Dionysus returned to Greece from his Eastern expedition, he
  encountered great opposition from Lycurgus, king of Thrace, and Pentheus,
  king of Thebes. The former, highly disapproving of the wild revels which
  attended the worship of the wine-god, drove away his attendants, the
  nymphs of Nysa, from that sacred mountain, and so effectually intimidated
  Dionysus, that he precipitated himself into the sea, where he was
  received into the arms of the ocean-nymph, Thetis. But the impious king
  bitterly expiated his sacrilegious conduct. He was punished with the loss
  of his reason, and, during one of his mad paroxysms, killed his own son
  Dryas, whom he mistook for a vine.

  Pentheus, king of Thebes, seeing his subjects so completely infatuated
  by the riotous worship of this new divinity, and fearing the demoralizing
  effects of the unseemly nocturnal orgies held in honour of the wine-god,
  strictly prohibited his people from taking any part in the wild
  Bacchanalian revels. Anxious to save him from the consequences of his
  impiety, Dionysus appeared to him under the form of a youth in the king's
  train, and earnestly warned him to desist from his denunciations. But the
  well-meant admonition failed in its purpose, for Pentheus only became
  more incensed at this interference, and, commanding Dionysus to be cast
  into prison, caused the most cruel preparations to be made for his
  immediate execution. But the god soon freed himself from his ignoble
  confinement, for scarcely had his jailers departed, ere the prison-doors
  opened of themselves, and, bursting asunder his iron chains, he escaped
  to rejoin his devoted followers.

  Meanwhile, the mother of the king and her sisters, inspired with
  Bacchanalian fury, had repaired to Mount Cithæron, in order to join the
  worshippers of the  a
  name="page127">[127]wine-god in those dreadful orgies which
  were solemnized exclusively by women, and at which no man was allowed to
  be present. Enraged at finding his commands thus openly disregarded by
  the members of his own family, Pentheus resolved to witness for himself
  the excesses of which he had heard such terrible reports, and for this
  purpose, concealed himself behind a tree on Mount Cithæron; but his
  hiding-place being discovered, he was dragged out by the half-maddened
  crew of Bacchantes and, horrible to relate, he was torn in pieces by his
  own mother Agave and her two sisters.

  An incident which occurred to Dionysus on one of his travels has been
  a favourite subject with the classic poets. One day, as some Tyrrhenian
  pirates approached the shores of Greece, they beheld Dionysus, in the
  form of a beautiful youth, attired in radiant garments. Thinking to
  secure a rich prize, they seized him, bound him, and conveyed him on
  board their vessel, resolved to carry him with them to Asia and there
  sell him as a slave. But the fetters dropped from his limbs, and the
  pilot, who was the first to perceive the miracle, called upon his
  companions to restore the youth carefully to the spot whence they had
  taken him, assuring them that he was a god, and that adverse winds and
  storms would, in all probability, result from their impious conduct. But,
  refusing to part with their prisoner, they set sail for the open sea.
  Suddenly, to the alarm of all on board, the ship stood still, masts and
  sails were covered with clustering vines and wreaths of ivy-leaves,
  streams of fragrant wine inundated the vessel, and heavenly strains of
  music were heard around. The terrified crew, too late repentant, crowded
  round the pilot for protection, and entreated him to steer for the shore.
  But the hour of retribution had arrived. Dionysus assumed the form of a
  lion, whilst beside him appeared a bear, which, with a terrific roar,
  rushed upon the captain and tore him in pieces; the sailors, in an agony
  of terror, leaped overboard, and were changed into dolphins. The discreet
  and pious steersman was alone permitted to escape the fate of his
  companions,  a
  name="page128">[128]and to him Dionysus, who had resumed his
  true form, addressed words of kind and affectionate encouragement, and
  announced his name and dignity. They now set sail, and Dionysus desired
  the pilot to land him at the island of Naxos, where he found the lovely
  Ariadne, daughter of Minos, king of Crete. She had been abandoned by
  Theseus on this lonely spot, and, when Dionysus now beheld her, was lying
  fast asleep on a rock, worn out with sorrow and weeping. Wrapt in
  admiration, the god stood gazing at the beautiful vision before him, and
  when she at length unclosed her eyes, he revealed himself to her, and, in
  gentle tones, sought to banish her grief. Grateful for his kind sympathy,
  coming as it did at a moment when she had deemed herself forsaken and
  friendless, she gradually regained her former serenity, and, yielding to
  his entreaties, consented to become his wife.

  Dionysus, having established his worship in various parts of the
  world, descended to the realm of shades in search of his ill-fated
  mother, whom he conducted to Olympus, where, under the name of Thyone,
  she was admitted into the assembly of the immortal gods.

  Among the most noted worshippers of Dionysus was Midas, a
  name="NtA_46" href="#Nt_46">[46] the wealthy king of
  Phrygia, the same who, as already related, gave judgment against Apollo.
  Upon one occasion Silenus, the preceptor and friend of Dionysus, being in
  an intoxicated condition, strayed into the rose-gardens of this monarch,
  where he was found by some of the king's attendants, who bound him with
  roses and conducted him to the presence of their royal master. Midas
  treated the aged satyr with the greatest consideration, and, after
  entertaining him hospitably for ten days, led him back to Dionysus, who
  was so grateful for the kind attention shown to his old friend, that he
  offered to grant Midas any favour he chose to demand; whereupon the
  avaricious monarch, not content with his boundless wealth, and still
  thirsting for more, desired that everything he touched might turn to
  gold. The request was  a
  name="page129">[129]complied with in so literal a sense, that
  the now wretched Midas bitterly repented his folly and cupidity, for,
  when the pangs of hunger assailed him, and he essayed to appease his
  cravings, the food became gold ere he could swallow it; as he raised the
  cup of wine to his parched lips, the sparkling draught was changed into
  the metal he had so coveted, and when at length, wearied and faint, he
  stretched his aching frame on his hitherto luxurious couch, this also was
  transformed into the substance which had now become the curse of his
  existence. The despairing king at last implored the god to take back the
  fatal gift, and Dionysus, pitying his unhappy plight, desired him to
  bathe in the river Pactolus, a small stream in Lydia, in order to lose
  the power which had become the bane of his life. Midas joyfully obeying
  the injunction, was at once freed from the consequences of his avaricious
  demand, and from this time forth the sands of the river Pactolus have
  ever contained grains of gold.

  Representations of Dionysus are of two kinds. According to the
  earliest conceptions, he appears as a grave and dignified man in the
  prime of life; his countenance is earnest, thoughtful, and benevolent; he
  wears a full beard, and is draped from head to foot in the garb of an
  Eastern monarch. But the sculptors of a later period represent him as a
  youth of singular beauty, though of somewhat effeminate appearance; the
  expression of the countenance is gentle and winning; the limbs are supple
  and gracefully moulded; and the hair, which is adorned by a wreath of
  vine or ivy leaves, falls over the shoulders in long curls. In one hand
  he bears the Thyrsus, and in the other a drinking-cup with two handles,
  these being his distinguishing attributes. He is often represented riding
  on a panther, or seated in a chariot drawn by lions, tigers, panthers, or
  lynxes.

  Being the god of wine, which is calculated to promote sociability, he
  rarely appears alone, but is usually accompanied by Bacchantes, satyrs,
  and mountain-nymphs.

  The finest modern representation of Ariadne is that by Danneker, at
  Frankfort-on-the-Maine. In this statue she  span
  class="pagenum">[130]appears riding on a
  panther; the beautiful upturned face inclines slightly over the left
  shoulder; the features are regular and finely cut, and a wreath of
  ivy-leaves encircles the well-shaped head. With her right hand she
  gracefully clasps the folds of drapery which fall away negligently from
  her rounded form, whilst the other rests lightly and caressingly on the
  head of the animal.

  Dionysus was regarded as the patron of the drama, and at the state
  festival of the Dionysia, which was celebrated with great pomp in the
  city of Athens, dramatic entertainments took place in his honour, for
  which all the renowned Greek dramatists of antiquity composed their
  immortal tragedies and comedies.

  He was also a prophetic divinity, and possessed oracles, the principal
  of which was that on Mount Rhodope in Thrace.

  The tiger, lynx, panther, dolphin, serpent, and ass were sacred to
  this god. His favourite plants were the vine, ivy, laurel, and asphodel.
  His sacrifices consisted of goats, probably on account of their being
  destructive to vineyards.

BACCHUS OR LIBER.

  The Romans had a divinity called Liber who presided over vegetation,
  and was, on this account, identified with the Greek Dionysus, and
  worshipped under the name of Bacchus.

  The festival of Liber, called the Liberalia, was celebrated on the
  17th of March.

AÏDES (Pluto).

  Aïdes, Aïdoneus, or Hades, was the son of Cronus and Rhea, and the
  youngest brother of Zeus and Poseidon. He was the ruler of that
  subterranean region called Erebus, which was inhabited by the shades or
  spirits of the dead, and also by those dethroned and exiled deities who
  had been vanquished by Zeus and his allies. Aïdes, the grim and gloomy
  monarch of this lower world, was the  span
  class="pagenum">[131]successor of Erebus,
  that ancient primeval divinity after whom these realms were called.

  The early Greeks regarded Aïdes in the light of their greatest foe,
  and Homer tells us that he was "of all the gods the most detested," being
  in their eyes the grim robber who stole from them their nearest and
  dearest, and eventually deprived each of them of their share in
  terrestrial existence. His name was so feared that it was never mentioned
  by mortals, who, when they invoked him, struck the earth with their
  hands, and in sacrificing to him turned away their faces.

  The belief of the people with regard to a future state was, in the
  Homeric age, a sad and cheerless one. It was supposed that when a mortal
  ceased to exist, his spirit tenanted the shadowy outline of the human
  form it had quitted. These shadows, or shades as they were called, were
  driven by Aïdes into his dominions, where they passed their time, some in
  brooding over the vicissitudes of fortune which they had experienced on
  earth, others in regretting the lost pleasures they had enjoyed in life,
  but all in a condition of semi-consciousness, from which the intellect
  could only be roused to full activity by drinking of the blood of the
  sacrifices offered to their shades by living friends, which, for a time,
  endowed them with their former mental vigour. The only beings supposed to
  enjoy any happiness in a future state were the heroes, whose acts of
  daring and deeds of prowess had, during their life, reflected honour on
  the land of their birth; and even these, according to Homer, pined after
  their career of earthly activity. He tells us that when Odysseus visited
  the lower world at the command of Circe, and held communion with the
  shades of the heroes of the Trojan war, Achilles assured him that he
  would rather be the poorest day-labourer on earth than reign supreme over
  the realm of shades.

  The early Greek poets offer but scanty allusions to Erebus. Homer
  appears purposely to envelop these realms in vagueness and mystery, in
  order, probably, to heighten the sensation of awe inseparably connected
  with  a
  name="page132">[132]the lower world. In the Odyssey he
  describes the entrance to Erebus as being beyond the furthermost edge of
  Oceanus, in the far west, where dwelt the Cimmerians, enveloped in
  eternal mists and darkness.

  In later times, however, in consequence of extended intercourse with
  foreign nations, new ideas became gradually introduced, and we find
  Egyptian theories with regard to a future state taking root in Greece,
  which become eventually the religious belief of the whole nation. It is
  now that the poets and philosophers, and more especially the teachers of
  the Eleusinian Mysteries, begin to inculcate the doctrine of the future
  reward and punishment of good and bad deeds. Aïdes, who had hitherto been
  regarded as the dread enemy of mankind, who delights in his grim office,
  and keeps the shades imprisoned in his dominions after withdrawing them
  from the joys of existence, now receives them with hospitality and
  friendship, and Hermes replaces him as conductor of shades to Hades.
  Under this new aspect Aïdes usurps the functions of a totally different
  divinity called Plutus (the god of riches), and is henceforth regarded as
  the giver of wealth to mankind, in the shape of those precious metals
  which lie concealed in the bowels of the earth.

  The later poets mention various entrances to Erebus, which were for
  the most part caves and fissures. There was one in the mountain of
  Taenarum, another in Thesprotia, and a third, the most celebrated of all,
  in Italy, near the pestiferous Lake Avernus, over which it is said no
  bird could fly, so noxious were its exhalations.

  In the dominions of Aïdes there were four great rivers, three of which
  had to be crossed by all the shades. These three were Acheron (sorrow),
  Cocytus (lamentation), and Styx (intense darkness), the sacred stream
  which flowed nine times round these realms.

  The shades were ferried over the Styx by the grim, unshaven old
  boatman Charon, who, however, only took those whose bodies had received
  funereal rites on earth, and who had brought with them his indispensable
  toll, which was a small coin or obolus, usually placed under the  !--
  Page 133 --> a
  name="page133">[133]tongue of a dead person for this purpose.
  If these conditions had not been fulfilled, the unhappy shades were left
  behind to wander up and down the banks for a hundred years as restless
  spirits.

  On the opposite bank of the Styx was the tribunal of Minos, the
  supreme judge, before whom all shades had to appear, and who, after
  hearing full confession of their actions whilst on earth, pronounced the
  sentence of happiness or misery to which their deeds had entitled them.
  This tribunal was guarded by the terrible triple-headed dog Cerberus,
  who, with his three necks bristling with snakes, lay at full length on
  the ground;       a formidable sentinel, who permitted all shades to
  enter, but none to return.

  The happy spirits, destined to enjoy the delights of Elysium, passed
  out on the right, and proceeded to the golden palace where Aïdes and
  Persephone held their royal court, from whom they received a kindly
  greeting, ere they set out for the Elysian Fields which lay beyond. a
  name="NtA_47" href="#Nt_47">[47] This blissful region was
  replete with all that could charm the senses or please the imagination;
  the air was balmy and fragrant, rippling brooks flowed peacefully through
  the smiling meadows, which glowed with the varied hues of a thousand
  flowers, whilst the groves resounded with the joyous songs of birds. The
  occupations and amusements of the happy shades were of the same nature as
  those which they had delighted in whilst on earth. Here the warrior found
  his horses, chariots, and arms, the musician his lyre, and the hunter his
  quiver and bow.

  In a secluded vale of Elysium there flowed a gentle, silent stream,
  called Lethe (oblivion), whose waters had the effect of dispelling care,
  and producing utter forgetfulness of former events. According to the
  Pythagorean doctrine of the transmigration of souls, it was supposed that
  after the shades had inhabited Elysium for a thousand years they were
  destined to animate other bodies on  span
  class="pagenum">[134]earth, and before
  leaving Elysium they drank of the river Lethe, in order that they might
  enter upon their new career without any remembrance of the past.

  The guilty souls, after leaving the presence of Minos, were conducted
  to the great judgment-hall of Hades, whose massive walls of solid adamant
  were surrounded by the river Phlegethon, the waves of which rolled flames
  of fire, and lit up, with their lurid glare, these awful realms. In the
  interior sat the dread judge Rhadamanthus, who declared to each comer the
  precise torments which awaited him in Tartarus. The wretched sinners were
  then seized by the Furies, who scourged them with their whips, and
  dragged them along to the great gate, which closed the opening to
  Tartarus, into whose awful depths they were hurled, to suffer endless
  torture.

  Tartarus was a vast and gloomy expanse, as far below Hades as the
  earth is distant from the skies. There the Titans, fallen from their high
  estate, dragged out a dreary and monotonous existence; there also were
  Otus and Ephialtes, those giant sons of Poseidon, who, with impious
  hands, had attempted to scale Olympus and dethrone its mighty ruler.
  Principal among the sufferers in this abode of gloom were Tityus,
  Tantalus, Sisyphus, Ixion, and the Danaïdes.

  TITYUS, one of the earth-born giants, had insulted Hera on her
  way to Peitho, for which offence Zeus flung him into Tartarus, where he
  suffered dreadful torture, inflicted by two vultures, which perpetually
  gnawed his liver.

  TANTALUS was a wise and wealthy king of Lydia, with whom the
  gods themselves condescended to associate; he was even permitted to sit
  at table with Zeus, who delighted in his conversation, and listened with
  interest to the wisdom of his observations. Tantalus, however, elated at
  these distinguished marks of divine favour, presumed upon his position,
  and used unbecoming language to Zeus himself; he also stole nectar and
  ambrosia from the table of the gods, with which he regaled his friends;
  but his greatest crime consisted in killing his own son,  !-- Page 135
  -->[135]Pelops, and
  serving him up at one of the banquets to the gods, in order to test their
  omniscience. For these heinous offences he was condemned by Zeus to
  eternal punishment in Tartarus, where, tortured with an ever-burning
  thirst, he was plunged up to the chin in water, which, as he stooped to
  drink, always receded from his parched lips. Tall trees, with spreading
  branches laden with delicious fruits, hung temptingly over his head; but
  no sooner did he raise himself to grasp them, than a wind arose, and
  carried them beyond his reach.

  SISYPHUS was a great tyrant who, according to some accounts,
  barbarously murdered all travellers who came into his dominions, by
  hurling upon them enormous pieces of rock. In punishment for his crimes
  he was condemned to roll incessantly a huge block of stone up a steep
  hill, which, as soon as it reached the summit, always rolled back again
  to the plain below.

  IXION was a king of Thessaly to whom Zeus accorded the
  privilege of joining the festive banquets of the gods; but, taking
  advantage of his exalted position, he presumed to aspire to the favour of
  Hera, which so greatly incensed Zeus, that he struck him with his
  thunderbolts, and commanded Hermes to throw him into Tartarus, and bind
  him to an ever-revolving wheel.

  The DANAÏDES were the fifty daughters of Danaus, king of Argos,
  who had married their fifty cousins, the sons of Ægyptus. By the command
  of their father, who had been warned by an oracle that his son-in-law
  would cause his death, they all killed their husbands in one night,
  Hypermnestra alone excepted. Their punishment in the lower world was to
  fill with water a vessel full of holes,       a never-ending and useless
  task.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0136-1.png"
      alt="Aïdes and Persephone" title="Aïdes and Persephone" />
  
  Aïdes is usually represented as a man of mature years and stern
  majestic mien, bearing a striking resemblance to his brother Zeus; but
  the gloomy and inexorable expression of the face contrasts forcibly with
  that peculiar benignity which so characterizes the countenance of the
  mighty ruler of heaven. He is seated on a throne of ebony, with his
  queen, the grave and sad Persephone,  span
  class="pagenum">[136]beside him, and wears a
  full beard, and long flowing black hair, which hangs straight down over
  his forehead; in his hand he either bears a two-pronged fork or the keys
  of the lower world, and at his feet sits Cerberus. He is sometimes seen
  in a chariot of gold, drawn by four black horses, and wearing on his head
  a helmet made for him by the Cyclops, which rendered the wearer
  invisible. This helmet he frequently lent to mortals and immortals.

  Aïdes, who was universally worshipped throughout Greece, had temples
  erected to his honour in Elis, Olympia, and also at Athens.

  His sacrifices, which took place at night, consisted of black sheep,
  and the blood, instead of being sprinkled on the altars or received in
  vessels, as at other sacrifices, was permitted to run down into a trench,
  dug for this purpose. The officiating priests wore black robes, and were
  crowned with cypress.

  The narcissus, maiden-hair, and cypress were sacred to this
  divinity.

PLUTO.

  Before the introduction into Rome of the religion and literature of
  Greece, the Romans had no belief in a realm of future happiness or
  misery, corresponding to the Greek Hades; hence they had no god of the
  lower world identical with Aïdes. They supposed that there was, in the
  centre of the earth, a vast, gloomy, and impenetrably dark cavity called
  Orcus, which formed a place of eternal rest for the dead. But with the
  introduction of Greek mythology, the Roman Orcus became the Greek Hades,
  and  a
  name="page137">[137]all the Greek notions with regard to a
  future state now obtained with the Romans, who worshipped Aïdes under the
  name of Pluto, his other appellations being Dis (from dives, rich)
  and Orcus from the dominions over which he ruled. In Rome there were no
  temples erected to this divinity.

PLUTUS.

  Plutus, the son of Demeter and a mortal called Iasion, was the god of
  wealth, and is represented as being lame when he makes his appearance,
  and winged when he takes his departure. He was supposed to be both blind
  and foolish, because he bestows his gifts without discrimination, and
  frequently upon the most unworthy objects.

  Plutus was believed to have his abode in the bowels of the earth,
  which was probably the reason why, in later times, Aïdes became
  confounded with this divinity.



MINOR DIVINITIES.

THE HARPIES.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0137-1.png"
      alt="A Harpy" title="A Harpy" />
  
  The Harpies, who, like the Furies, were employed by the gods as
  instruments for the punishment of the guilty, were three female
  divinities, daughters of Thaumas and Electra, called Aello, Ocypete, and
  Celæno.

  They were represented with the head of a fair-haired maiden and the
  body of a vulture, and were perpetually devoured by the pangs of
  insatiable hunger, which caused them to torment their victims by robbing
  them of their food; this they either devoured with great  !-- Page 138
  -->[138]gluttony, or
  defiled in such a manner as to render it unfit to be eaten.

  Their wonderfully rapid flight far surpassed that of birds, or even of
  the winds themselves. If any mortal suddenly and unaccountably
  disappeared, the Harpies were believed to have carried him off. Thus they
  were supposed to have borne away the daughters of King Pandareos to act
  as servants to the Erinyes.

  The Harpies would appear to be personifications of sudden tempests,
  which, with ruthless violence, sweep over whole districts, carrying off
  or injuring all before them.

ERINYES, EUMENIDES (Furiæ, Diræ).

  The Erinyes or Furies were female divinities who personified the
  torturing pangs of an evil conscience, and the remorse which inevitably
  follows wrong-doing.

  Their names were Alecto, Megæra, and Tisiphone, and their origin was
  variously accounted for. According to Hesiod, they sprang from the blood
  of Uranus, when wounded by Cronus, and were hence supposed to be the
  embodiment of all the terrible imprecations, which the defeated deity
  called down upon the head of his rebellious son. According to other
  accounts they were the daughters of Night.

  Their place of abode was the lower world, where they were employed by
  Aïdes and Persephone to chastise and torment those shades who, during
  their earthly career, had committed crimes, and had not been reconciled
  to the gods before descending to Hades.

  But their sphere of action was not confined to the realm of shades,
  for they appeared upon earth as the avenging deities who relentlessly
  pursued and punished murderers, perjurers, those who had failed in duty
  to their parents, in hospitality to strangers, or in the respect due to
  old age. Nothing escaped the piercing glance of these terrible
  divinities, from whom flight was unavailing, for no corner of the earth
  was so remote as  a
  name="page139">[139]to be beyond their reach, nor did any
  mortal dare to offer to their victims an asylum from their
  persecutions.

  The Furies are frequently represented with wings; their bodies are
  black, blood drips from their eyes, and snakes twine in their hair. In
  their hands they bear either a dagger, scourge, torch, or serpent.

  When they pursued Orestes they constantly held up a mirror to his
  horrified gaze, in which he beheld the face of his murdered mother.

  These divinities were also called Eumenides, which signifies the
  "well-meaning" or "soothed goddesses;" This appellation was given to them
  because they were so feared and dreaded that people dared not call them
  by their proper title, and hoped by this means to propitiate their
  wrath.

  In later times the Furies came to be regarded as salutary agencies,
  who, by severely punishing sin, upheld the cause of morality and social
  order, and thus contributed to the welfare of mankind. They now lose
  their awe-inspiring aspect, and are represented, more especially in
  Athens, as earnest maidens, dressed, like Artemis, in short tunics
  suitable for the chase, but still retaining, in their hands, the wand of
  office in the form of a snake.

  Their sacrifices consisted of black sheep and a libation composed of a
  mixture of honey and water, called Nephalia. A celebrated temple was
  erected to the Eumenides at Athens, near the Areopagus.

MOIRÆ or FATES (Parcæ).

  The ancients believed that the duration of human existence and the
  destinies of mortals were regulated by three sister-goddesses, called
  Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, who were the daughters of Zeus and
  Themis.

  The power which they wielded over the fate of man was significantly
  indicated under the figure of a thread, which they spun out for the life
  of each human being from his birth to the grave. This occupation they

  her sister Lachesis, who span out the thread of life, which Atropos, with
  her scissors, relentlessly snapt asunder, when the career of an
  individual was about to terminate.

  Homer speaks of one Moira only, the daughter of Night, who represents
  the moral force by which the universe is governed, and to whom both
  mortals and immortals were forced to submit, Zeus himself being powerless
  to avert her decrees; but in later times this conception of one
  inexorable, all-conquering fate became amplified by the poets into that
  above described, and the Moiræ are henceforth the special presiding
  deities over the life and death of mortals.

  The Moiræ are represented by the poets as stern, inexorable female
  divinities, aged, hideous, and also lame, which is evidently meant to
  indicate the slow and halting march of destiny, which they controlled.
  Painters and sculptors, on the other hand, depicted them as beautiful
  maidens of a grave but kindly aspect.

  There is a charming representation of Lachesis, which depicts her in
  all the grace of youth and beauty. She is sitting spinning, and at her
  feet lie two masks, one comic, the other tragic, as though to convey the
  idea, that, to a divinity of fate, the brightest and saddest scenes of
  earthly existence are alike indifferent, and that she quietly and
  steadily pursues her occupation, regardless of human weal or woe.

  When represented at the feet of Aïdes in the lower world they are clad
  in dark robes; but when they appear in Olympus they wear bright garments,
  bespangled with stars, and are seated on radiant thrones, with crowns on
  their heads.

  It was considered the function of the Moiræ to indicate to the Furies
  the precise torture which the wicked should undergo for their crimes.

  They were regarded as prophetic divinities, and had sanctuaries in
  many parts of Greece.

  The Moiræ are mentioned as assisting the Charites to conduct
  Persephone to the upper world at her periodical  span
  class="pagenum">[141]reunion with her mother
  Demeter. They also appear in company with Eileithyia, goddess of
  birth.

NEMESIS.

  Nemesis, the daughter of Nyx, represents that power which adjusts the
  balance of human affairs, by awarding to each individual the fate which
  his actions deserve. She rewards, humble, unacknowledged merit, punishes
  crime, deprives the worthless of undeserved good fortune, humiliates the
  proud and overbearing, and visits all evil on the wrong-doer; thus
  maintaining that proper balance of things, which the Greeks recognized as
  a necessary condition of all civilized life. But though Nemesis, in her
  original character, was the distributor of rewards as well as
  punishments, the world was so full of sin, that she found but little
  occupation in her first capacity, and hence became finally regarded as
  the avenging goddess only.

  We have seen a striking instance of the manner in which this divinity
  punishes the proud and arrogant in the history of Niobe. Apollo and
  Artemis were merely the instruments for avenging the insult offered to
  their mother; but it was Nemesis who prompted the deed, and presided over
  its execution.

  Homer makes no mention of Nemesis; it is therefore evident that she
  was a conception of later times, when higher views of morality had
  obtained among the Greek nation.

  Nemesis is represented as a beautiful woman of thoughtful and benign
  aspect and regal bearing; a diadem crowns her majestic brow, and she
  bears in her hand a rudder, balance, and cubit;       fitting emblems of
  the manner in which she guides, weighs, and measures all human events.
  She is also sometimes seen with a wheel, to symbolize the rapidity with
  which she executes justice. As the avenger of evil she appears winged,
  bearing in her hand either a scourge or a sword, and seated in a chariot
  drawn by griffins.  a
  name="page142">[142]

  Nemesis is frequently called Adrastia, and also Rhamnusia, from
  Rhamnus in Attica, the chief seat of her worship, which contained a
  celebrated statue of the goddess.

  Nemesis was worshipped by the Romans, (who invoked her on the
  Capitol), as a divinity who possessed the power of averting the
  pernicious consequences of envy.

NIGHT AND HER CHILDREN.
DEATH, SLEEP, AND DREAMS.

NYX (Nox).

  Nyx, the daughter of Chaos, being the personification of Night, was,
  according to the poetic ideas of the Greeks, considered to be the mother
  of everything mysterious and inexplicable, such as death, sleep, dreams,
       c. She became united to Erebus, and their children were Aether and
  Hemera (Air and Daylight), evidently a simile of the poets, to indicate
  that darkness always precedes light.

  Nyx inhabited a palace in the dark regions of the lower world, and is
  represented as a beautiful woman, seated in a chariot, drawn by two black
  horses. She is clothed in dark robes, wears a long veil, and is
  accompanied by the stars, which follow in her train.

THANATOS (Mors) AND HYPNUS (Somnus).

  Thanatos (Death) and his twin-brother Hypnus (Sleep) were the children
  of Nyx.

  Their dwelling was in the realm of shades, and when they appear among
  mortals, Thanatos is feared and hated as the enemy of mankind, whose hard
  heart knows no pity, whilst his brother Hypnus is universally loved and
  welcomed as their kindest and most beneficent friend.

  But though the ancients regarded Thanatos as a gloomy and mournful
  divinity, they did not represent him with any exterior repulsiveness. On
  the contrary, he appears as a beautiful youth, who holds in his hand an
  inverted  a
  name="page143">[143]torch, emblematical of the light of life
  being extinguished, whilst his disengaged arm is thrown lovingly round
  the shoulder of his brother Hypnus.

  Hypnus is sometimes depicted standing erect with closed eyes; at
  others he is in a recumbent position beside his brother Thanatos, and
  usually bears a poppy-stalk in his hand.

  A most interesting description of the abode of Hypnus is given by Ovid
  in his Metamorphoses. He tells us how the god of Sleep dwelt in a
  mountain-cave near the realm of the Cimmerians, which the sun never
  pierced with his rays. No sound disturbed the stillness, no song of
  birds, not a branch moved, and no human voice broke the profound silence
  which reigned everywhere. From the lowermost rocks of the cave issued the
  river Lethe, and one might almost have supposed that its course was
  arrested, were it not for the low, monotonous hum of the water, which
  invited slumber. The entrance was partially hidden by numberless white
  and red poppies, which Mother Night had gathered and planted there, and
  from the juice of which she extracts drowsiness, which she scatters in
  liquid drops all over the earth, as soon as the sun-god has sunk to rest.
  In the centre of the cave stands a couch of blackest ebony, with a bed of
  down, over which is laid a coverlet of sable hue. Here the god himself
  reposes, surrounded by innumerable forms. These are idle dreams, more
  numerous than the sands of the sea. Chief among them is Morpheus, that
  changeful god, who may assume any shape or form he pleases. Nor can the
  god of Sleep resist his own power; for though he may rouse himself for a
  while, he soon succumbs to the drowsy influences which surround him.

MORPHEUS.

  Morpheus, the son of Hypnus, was the god of Dreams.

  He is always represented winged, and appears sometimes as a youth,
  sometimes as an old man. In his hand he bears a cluster of poppies, and
  as he steps with  a
  name="page144">[144]noiseless footsteps over the earth, he
  gently scatters the seeds of this sleep-producing plant over the eyes of
  weary mortals.

  Homer describes the House of Dreams as having two gates: one, whence
  issue all deceptive and flattering visions, being formed of ivory; the
  other, through which proceed those dreams which are fulfilled, of
  horn.

THE GORGONS.

  The Gorgons, Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa, were the three daughters of
  Phorcys and Ceto, and were the personification of those benumbing, and,
  as it were, petrifying sensations, which result from sudden and extreme
  fear.

  They were frightful winged monsters, whose bodies were covered with
  scales; hissing, wriggling snakes clustered round their heads instead of
  hair; their hands were of brass; their teeth resembled the tusks of a
  wild boar; and their whole aspect was so appalling, that they are said to
  have turned into stone all who beheld them.

  These terrible sisters were supposed to dwell in that remote and
  mysterious region in the far West, beyond the sacred stream of
  Oceanus.

  The Gorgons were the servants of Aïdes, who made use of them to
  terrify and overawe those shades, doomed to be kept in a constant state
  of unrest as a punishment for their misdeeds, whilst the Furies, on their
  part, scourged them with their whips and tortured them incessantly.

  The most celebrated of the three sisters was Medusa, who alone was
  mortal. She was originally a golden-haired and very beautiful maiden,
  who, as a priestess of Athene, was devoted to a life of celibacy; but,
  being wooed by Poseidon, whom she loved in return, she forgot her vows,
  and became united to him in marriage. For this offence she was punished
  by the goddess in a most terrible manner. Each wavy lock of the beautiful
  hair which had so charmed her husband, was changed into a  !-- Page 145
  -->[145]venomous
  snake; her once gentle, love-inspiring eyes now became blood-shot,
  furious orbs, which excited fear and disgust in the mind of the beholder;
  whilst her former roseate hue and milk-white skin assumed a loathsome
  greenish tinge. Seeing herself thus transformed into so repulsive an
  object, Medusa fled from her home, never to return. Wandering about,
  abhorred, dreaded, and shunned by all the world, she now developed into a
  character, worthy of her outward appearance. In her despair she fled to
  Africa, where, as she passed restlessly from place to place, infant
  snakes dropped from her hair, and thus, according to the belief of the
  ancients, that country became the hotbed of these venomous reptiles. With
  the curse of Athene upon her, she turned into stone whomsoever she gazed
  upon, till at last, after a life of nameless misery, deliverance came to
  her in the shape of death, at the hands of Perseus.

  It is well to observe that when the Gorgons are spoken of in the
  singular, it is Medusa who is alluded to.

  Medusa was the mother of Pegasus and Chrysaor, father of the
  three-headed, winged giant Geryones, who was slain by Heracles.

GRÆÆ.

  The Grææ, who acted as servants to their sisters the Gorgons, were
  also three in number; their names were Pephredo, Enyo, and Dino.

  In their original conception they were merely personifications of
  kindly and venerable old age, possessing all its benevolent attributes
  without its natural infirmities. They were old and gray from their birth,
  and so they ever remained. In later times, however, they came to be
  regarded as misshapen females, decrepid, and hideously ugly, having only
  one eye, one tooth, and one gray wig between them, which they lent to
  each other, when one of them wished to appear before the world.

  When Perseus entered upon his expedition to slay the Medusa, he
  repaired to the abode of the Grææ, in the far  span
  class="pagenum">[146]west, to inquire the
  way to the Gorgons, and on their refusing to give any information, he
  deprived them of their one eye, tooth, and wig, and did not restore them
  until he received the necessary directions.

SPHINX.

  The Sphinx was an ancient Egyptian divinity, who personified wisdom,
  and the fertility of nature. She is represented as a lion-couchant, with
  the head and bust of a woman, and wears a peculiar sort of hood, which
  completely envelops her head, and falls down on either side of the
  face.

  Transplanted into Greece, this sublime and mysterious Egyptian deity
  degenerates into an insignificant, and yet malignant power, and though
  she also deals in mysteries, they are, as we shall see, of a totally
  different character, and altogether inimical to human life.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0147-1.png"
      alt="The Sphinx" title="The Sphinx" />
  
  The Sphinx is represented, according to Greek genealogy, as the
  offspring of Typhon and Echidna. a name="NtA_48"
  href="#Nt_48">[48] Hera, being upon one occasion
  displeased with the Thebans, sent them this awful monster, as a
  punishment for their offences. Taking her seat on a rocky eminence near
  the city of Thebes, commanding a pass which the Thebans were compelled to
  traverse in their usual way of business, she propounded to all comers a
  riddle, and if they failed to solve it, she tore them in pieces.

  During the reign of King Creon, so many people had fallen a sacrifice
  to this monster, that he determined to use every effort to rid the
  country of so terrible a scourge. On consulting the oracle of Delphi, he
  was informed that the only way to destroy the Sphinx was to solve one of
  her riddles, when she would immediately precipitate herself from the rock
  on which she was seated.

  Creon, accordingly, made a public declaration to the effect, that
  whoever could give the true interpretation of a riddle propounded by the
  monster, should obtain the crown, and the hand of his sister Jocaste.
         dipus offered  a
  name="page147">[147]himself as a candidate, and proceeding to
  the spot where she kept guard, received from her the following riddle for
  solution: "What creature goes in the morning on four legs, at noon on
  two, and in the evening on three?"        dipus replied, that it must be
  man, who during his infancy creeps on all fours, in his prime walks erect
  on two legs, and when old age has enfeebled his powers, calls a staff to
  his assistance, and thus has, as it were, three legs.

  The Sphinx no sooner heard this reply, which was the correct solution
  of her riddle, than she flung herself over the precipice, and perished in
  the abyss below.

  The Greek Sphinx may be recognized by having wings and by being of
  smaller dimensions than the Egyptian Sphinx.

TYCHE (Fortuna) AND ANANKE (Necessitas).

TYCHE (Fortuna).

  Tyche personified that peculiar combination of circumstances which we
  call luck or fortune, and was considered to be the source of all
  unexpected events in human life, whether good or evil. If a person
  succeeded in all he undertook without possessing any special merit of his
  own, Tyche was supposed to have smiled on his birth. If, on the other
  hand, undeserved ill-luck followed him through life, and all his efforts
  resulted in failure, it was ascribed to her adverse influence.

  This goddess of Fortune is variously represented. Sometimes she is
  depicted bearing in her hand two rudders, with one of which she steers
  the bark of the fortunate, and with the other that of the unfortunate
  among mortals. In later times she appears blindfolded, and stands on a
  ball or wheel, indicative of the fickleness and ever-revolving  !-- Page
  148 -->[148]changes of
  fortune. She frequently bears the sceptre and cornucopia a name="NtA_49"
  href="#Nt_49">[49] or horn of plenty, and is usually
  winged. In her temple at Thebes, she is represented holding the infant
  Plutus in her arms, to symbolize her power over riches and
  prosperity.

  Tyche was worshipped in various parts of Greece, but more particularly
  by the Athenians, who believed in her special predilection for their
  city.

FORTUNA.

  Tyche was worshipped in Rome under the name of Fortuna, and held a
  position of much greater importance among the Romans than the Greeks.

  In later times Fortuna is never represented either winged or standing
  on a ball; she merely bears the cornucopia. It is evident, therefore,
  that she had come to be regarded as the goddess of good luck only, who
  brings blessings to man, and not, as with the Greeks, as the
  personification of the fluctuations of fortune.

  In addition to Fortuna, the Romans worshipped Felicitas as the giver
  of positive good fortune.

ANANKE (Necessitas).

  As Ananke, Tyche assumes quite another character, and becomes the
  embodiment of those immutable laws of nature, by which certain causes
  produce certain inevitable results.

  In a statue of this divinity at Athens she was represented with hands
  of bronze, and surrounded with nails and hammers. The hands of bronze
  probably indicated the irresistible power of the inevitable, and the
  hammer and chains the fetters which she forged for man.

  Ananke was worshipped in Rome under the name of Necessitas.

[149]

KER.

  In addition to the Moiræ, who presided over the life of mortals, there
  was another divinity, called Ker, appointed for each human being at the
  moment of his birth. The Ker belonging to an individual was believed to
  develop with his growth, either for good or evil; and when the ultimate
  fate of a mortal was about to be decided, his Ker was weighed in the
  balance, and, according to the preponderance of its worth or
  worthlessness, life or death was awarded to the human being in question.
  It becomes evident, therefore, that according to the belief of the early
  Greeks, each individual had it in his power, to a certain extent, to
  shorten or prolong his own existence.

  The Keres, who are frequently mentioned by Homer, were the goddesses
  who delighted in the slaughter of the battle-field.

ATE.

  Ate, the daughter of Zeus and Eris, was a divinity who delighted in
  evil.

  Having instigated Hera to deprive Heracles of his birthright, her
  father seized her by the hair of her head, and hurled her from Olympus,
  forbidding her, under the most solemn imprecations, ever to return.
  Henceforth she wandered among mankind, sowing dissension, working
  mischief, and luring men to all actions inimical to their welfare and
  happiness. Hence, when a reconciliation took place between friends who
  had quarrelled, Ate was blamed as the original cause of disagreement.

MOMUS.

  Momus, the son of Nyx, was the god of raillery and ridicule, who
  delighted to criticise, with bitter sarcasm, the actions of gods and men,
  and contrived to discover in all things some defect or blemish. Thus when
  Prometheus created the first man, Momus considered his work incomplete
  because there was no aperture in the breast through which his inmost
  thoughts might be read. He  a
  name="page150">[150]also found fault with a house built by
  Athene because, being unprovided with the means of locomotion, it could
  never be removed from an unhealthy locality. Aphrodite alone defied his
  criticism, for, to his great chagrin, he could find no fault with her
  perfect form.[50]

  In what manner the ancients represented this god is unknown. In modern
  art he is depicted like a king's jester, with a fool's cap and bells.

EROS (Cupid, Amor) AND PSYCHE.

  According to Hesiod's Theogony, Eros, the divine spirit of Love,
  sprang forth from Chaos, while all was still in confusion, and by his
  beneficent power reduced to order and harmony the shapeless, conflicting
  elements, which, under his influence, began to assume distinct forms.
  This ancient Eros is represented as a full-grown and very beautiful
  youth, crowned with flowers, and leaning on a shepherd's crook.

  In the course of time, this beautiful conception gradually faded away,
  and though occasional mention still continues to be made of the Eros of
  Chaos, he is replaced by the son of Aphrodite, the popular,
  mischief-loving little god of Love, so familiar to us all.

  In one of the myths concerning Eros, Aphrodite is described as
  complaining to Themis, that her son, though so beautiful, did not appear
  to increase in stature; whereupon Themis suggested that his small
  proportions were probably attributable to the fact of his being always
  alone, and advised his mother to let him have a companion. Aphrodite
  accordingly gave him, as a playfellow, his younger brother Anteros
  (requited love), and soon had the gratification of seeing the little Eros
  begin to grow and thrive; but, curious to relate, this desirable result
  only continued as long as the brothers remained together, for the moment
  they were separated, Eros shrank once more to his original size.

[151]

  By degrees the conception of Eros became multiplied and we hear of
  little love-gods (Amors), who appear under the most charming and
  diversified forms. These love-gods, who afforded to artists inexhaustible
  subjects for the exercise of their imagination, are represented as being
  engaged in various occupations, such as hunting, fishing, rowing, driving
  chariots, and even busying themselves in mechanical labour.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0151-1.png"
      alt="Eros and Psyche" title="Eros and Psyche" />
  
  Perhaps no myth is more charming and interesting than that of Eros and
  Psyche, which is as follows:       Psyche, the youngest of three
  princesses, was so transcendently beautiful that Aphrodite herself became
  jealous of her, and no mortal dared to aspire to the honour of her hand.
  As her sisters, who were by no means equal to her in attractions, were
  married, and Psyche still remained unwedded, her father consulted the
  oracle of Delphi, and, in obedience to the divine response, caused her to
  be dressed as though for the grave, and conducted to the edge of a
  yawning precipice. No sooner was she alone than she felt herself lifted
  up, and wafted away by the gentle west wind Zephyrus, who transported her
  to a verdant meadow, in the midst of which stood a stately palace,
  surrounded by groves and fountains.

  Here dwelt Eros, the god of Love, in whose arms Zephyrus deposited his
  lovely burden. Eros, himself unseen, wooed her in the softest accents of
  affection; but warned her, as she valued his love, not to endeavour to
  behold his form. For some time Psyche was obedient to the injunction of
  her immortal spouse, and made no effort to gratify her natural curiosity;
  but, unfortunately, in the midst of her happiness she was seized with an
  unconquerable longing for the society of her  span
  class="pagenum">[152]sisters, and, in
  accordance with her desire, they were conducted by Zephyrus to her
  fairy-like abode. Filled with envy at the sight of her felicity, they
  poisoned her mind against her husband, and telling her that her unseen
  lover was a frightful monster, they gave her a sharp dagger, which they
  persuaded her to use for the purpose of delivering herself from his
  power.

  After the departure of her sisters, Psyche resolved to take the first
  opportunity of following their malicious counsel. She accordingly rose in
  the dead of night, and taking a lamp in one hand and a dagger in the
  other, stealthily approached the couch where Eros was reposing, when,
  instead of the frightful monster she had expected to see, the beauteous
  form of the god of Love greeted her view. Overcome with surprise and
  admiration, Psyche stooped down to gaze more closely on his lovely
  features, when, from the lamp which she held in her trembling hand, there
  fell a drop of burning oil upon the shoulder of the sleeping god, who
  instantly awoke, and seeing Psyche standing over him with the instrument
  of death in her hand, sorrowfully reproached her for her treacherous
  designs, and, spreading out his wings, flew away.

  In despair at having lost her lover, the unhappy Psyche endeavoured to
  put an end to her existence by throwing herself into the nearest river;
  but instead of closing over her, the waters bore her gently to the
  opposite bank, where Pan (the god of shepherds) received her, and
  consoled her with the hope of becoming eventually reconciled to her
  husband.

  Meanwhile her wicked sisters, in expectation of meeting with the same
  good fortune which had befallen Psyche, placed themselves on the edge of
  the rock, but were both precipitated into the chasm below.

  Psyche herself, filled with a restless yearning for her lost love,
  wandered all over the world in search of him. At length she appealed to
  Aphrodite to take compassion on her; but the goddess of Beauty, still
  jealous of her charms, imposed upon her the hardest tasks, the
  accomplishment of which often appeared impossible. In these  !-- Page 153
  -->[153]she was always
  assisted by invisible, beneficent beings, sent to her by Eros, who still
  loved her, and continued to watch over her welfare.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0154-1.png"
      alt="Eros" title="Eros" />
  
  Psyche had to undergo a long and severe penance before she became
  worthy to regain the happiness, which she had so foolishly trifled away.
  At last Aphrodite commanded her to descend into the under world, and
  obtain from Persephone a box containing all the charms of beauty.
  Psyche's courage now failed her, for she concluded that death must of
  necessity precede her entrance into the realm of shades. About to abandon
  herself to despair, she heard a voice which warned her of every danger to
  be avoided on her perilous journey, and instructed her with regard to
  certain precautions to be observed. These were as follows:       not to
  omit to provide herself with the ferryman's toll for Charon, and the cake
  to pacify Cerberus, also to refrain from taking any part in the banquets
  of Aïdes and Persephone, and, above all things, to bring the box of
  beauty charms unopened to Aphrodite. In conclusion, the voice assured
  her, that compliance with the above conditions would insure for her a
  safe return to the realms of light. But, alas, Psyche, who had implicitly
  followed all injunctions, could not withstand the temptation of the last
  condition; and, hardly had she quitted the lower world, when, unable to
  resist the curiosity which devoured her, she raised the lid of the box
  with eager expectation. But, instead of the wondrous charms of beauty
  which she expected to behold, there issued from the casket a dense black
  vapour, which had the effect of throwing her into a death-like sleep, out
  of which Eros, who had long hovered round her unseen, at length awoke her
  with the point of one of his golden arrows. He gently reproached her with
  this second proof of her curiosity and folly, and then, having persuaded
  Aphrodite to be reconciled to his beloved, he induced Zeus to admit her
  among the immortal gods.

  Their reunion was celebrated amidst the rejoicings of all the Olympian
  deities. The Graces shed perfume on  span
  class="pagenum">[154]their path, the Hours
  sprinkled roses over the sky, Apollo added the music of his lyre, and the
  Muses united their voices in a glad chorus of delight.

  This myth would appear to be an allegory, which signifies that the
  soul, before it can be reunited to its original divine essence, must be
  purified by the chastening sorrows and sufferings of its earthly
  career.[51]

  Eros is represented as a lovely boy, with rounded limbs, and a merry,
  roguish expression. He has golden wings, and a quiver slung over his
  shoulder, which contained his magical and unerring arrows; in one hand he
  bears his golden bow, and in the other a torch.

  He is also frequently depicted riding on a lion, dolphin, or eagle, or
  seated in a chariot drawn by stags or wild boars, undoubtedly
  emblematical of the power of love as the subduer of all nature, even of
  the wild animals.

  In Rome, Eros was worshipped under the name of Amor or Cupid.

HYMEN.

  Hymen or Hymenæus, the son of Apollo and the muse Urania, was the god
  who presided over marriage and nuptial solemnities, and was hence invoked
  at all marriage festivities.

  There is a myth concerning this divinity, which tells us that Hymen
  was a beautiful youth of very poor parents, who fell in love with a
  wealthy maiden, so far above him in rank, that he dared not cherish the
  hope of ever becoming united to her. Still he missed no opportunity of
  seeing her, and, upon one occasion, disguised himself as  !-- Page 155
  -->[155]a girl, and
  joined a troop of maidens, who, in company with his beloved, were
  proceeding from Athens to Eleusis, in order to attend a festival of
  Demeter. On their way thither they were surprised by pirates, who carried
  them off to a desert island, where the ruffians, after drinking deeply,
  fell into a heavy sleep. Hymen, seizing the opportunity, slew them all,
  and then set sail for Athens, where he found the parents of the maidens
  in the greatest distress at their unaccountable disappearance. He
  comforted them with the assurance that their children should be restored
  to them, provided they would promise to give him in marriage the maiden
  he loved. The condition being gladly complied with, he at once returned
  to the island, and brought back the maidens in safety to Athens,
  whereupon he became united to the object of his love; and their union
  proved so remarkably happy, that henceforth the name of Hymen became
  synonymous with conjugal felicity.

IRIS (The Rainbow).

  Iris, the daughter of Thaumas and Electra, personified the rainbow,
  and was the special attendant and messenger of the queen of heaven, whose
  commands she executed with singular tact, intelligence, and
  swiftness.

  Most primitive nations have regarded the rainbow as a bridge of
  communication between heaven and earth, and this is doubtless the reason
  why Iris, who represented that beautiful phenomenon of nature, should
  have been invested by the Greeks with the office of communicating between
  gods and men.

  Iris is usually represented seated behind the chariot of Hera, ready
  to do the bidding of her royal mistress. She appears under the form of a
  slender maiden of great beauty, robed in an airy fabric of variegated
  hues, resembling mother-of-pearl; her sandals are bright as burnished
  silver, she has golden wings, and wherever she appears, a radiance of
  light, and a sweet odour, as of delicate spring flowers, pervades the
  air.  a
  name="page156">[156]

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0156-1.png"
      alt="Hebe" title="Hebe" />
  
HEBE (Juventas).

  Hebe was the personification of eternal youth under its most
  attractive and joyous aspect.

  She was the daughter of Zeus and Hera, and though of such
  distinguished rank, is nevertheless represented as cup-bearer to the
  gods; a forcible exemplification of the old patriarchal custom, in
  accordance with which the daughters of the house, even when of the
  highest lineage, personally assisted in serving the guests.

  Hebe is represented as a comely, modest maiden, small, of a
  beautifully rounded contour, with nut-brown tresses and sparkling eyes.
  She is often depicted pouring out nectar from an upraised vessel, or
  bearing in her hand a shallow dish, supposed to contain ambrosia, the
  ever youth-renewing food of the immortals.

  In consequence of an act of awkwardness, which caused her to slip
  while serving the gods, Hebe was deprived of her office, which was
  henceforth delegated to Ganymedes, son of Tros.

  Hebe afterwards became the bride of Heracles, when, after his
  apotheosis, he was received among the immortals.

JUVENTAS.

  Juventas was the Roman divinity identified with Hebe, whose
  attributes, however, were regarded by the Romans as applying more
  particularly to the imperishable vigour and immortal glory of the
  state.

  In Rome, several temples were erected in honour of this goddess.  !--

GANYMEDES.

  Ganymedes, the youngest son of Tros, king of Troy, was one day drawing
  water from a well on Mount Ida, when he was observed by Zeus, who, struck
  with his wonderful beauty, sent his eagle to transport him to Olympus,
  where he was endowed with immortality, and appointed cup-bearer to the
  gods.

  Ganymedes is represented as a youth of exquisite beauty, with short
  golden locks, delicately chiselled features, beaming blue eyes, and
  pouting lips.

THE MUSES.

  Of all the Olympic deities, none occupy a more distinguished position
  than the Muses, the nine beautiful daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne.

  In their original signification, they presided merely over music,
  song, and dance; but with the progress of civilization the arts and
  sciences claimed their special presiding divinities, and we see these
  graceful creations, in later times, sharing among them various functions,
  such as poetry, astronomy,      c.

  The Muses were honoured alike by mortals and immortals. In Olympus,
  where Apollo acted as their leader, no banquet or festivity was
  considered complete without their joy-inspiring presence, and on earth no
  social gathering was celebrated without libations being poured out to
  them; nor was any task involving intellectual effort ever undertaken,
  without earnestly supplicating their assistance. They endowed their
  chosen favourites with knowledge, wisdom, and understanding; they
  bestowed upon the orator the gift of eloquence, inspired the poet with
  his noblest thoughts, and the musician with his sweetest harmonies.

  Like so many of the Greek divinities, however, the refined conception
  of the Muses is somewhat marred by the acerbity with which they punished
  any effort on the part  a
  name="page158">[158]of mortals to rival them in their divine
  powers. An instance of this is seen in the case of Thamyris, a Thracian
  bard, who presumed to invite them to a trial of skill in music. Having
  vanquished him, they not only afflicted him with blindness, but deprived
  him also of the power of song.

  Another example of the manner in which the gods punished presumption
  and vanity is seen in the story of the daughters of King Pierus. Proud of
  the perfection to which they had brought their skill in music, they
  presumed to challenge the Muses themselves in the art over which they
  specially presided. The contest took place on Mount Helicon, and it is
  said that when the mortal maidens commenced their song, the sky became
  dark and misty, whereas when the Muses raised their heavenly voices, all
  nature seemed to rejoice, and Mount Helicon itself moved with exultation.
  The Pierides were signally defeated, and were transformed by the Muses
  into singing birds, as a punishment for having dared to challenge
  comparison with the immortals.

  Undeterred by the above example, the Sirens also entered into a
  similar contest. The songs of the Muses were loyal and true, whilst those
  of the Sirens were the false and deceptive strains with which so many
  unfortunate mariners had been lured to their death. The Sirens were
  defeated by the Muses, and as a mark of humiliation, were deprived of the
  feathers with which their bodies were adorned.

  The oldest seat of the worship of the Muses was Pieria in Thrace,
  where they were supposed to have first seen the light of day. Pieria is a
  district on one of the sloping declivities of Mount Olympus, whence a
  number of rivulets, as they flow towards the plains beneath, produce
  those sweet, soothing sounds, which may possibly have suggested this spot
  as a fitting home for the presiding divinities of song.

  They dwelt on the summits of Mounts Helicon, Parnassus, and Pindus,
  and loved to haunt the springs and fountains which gushed forth amidst
  these rocky  a
  name="page159">[159]heights, all of which were sacred to them
  and to poetic inspiration. Aganippe and Hippocrene on Mount Helicon, and
  the Castalian spring on Mount Parnassus, were sacred to the Muses. The
  latter flowed between two lofty rocks above the city of Delphi, and in
  ancient times its waters were introduced into a square stone basin, where
  they were retained for the use of the Pythia and the priests of
  Apollo.

      alt="Calliope" title="Calliope" />
    Calliope.
  
  The libations to these divinities consisted of water, milk, and honey,
  but never of wine.

  Their names and functions are as follows:       

  CALLIOPE, the most honoured of the Muses, presided over heroic
  song and epic poetry, and is represented with a pencil in her hand, and a
  slate upon her knee.

  CLIO, the muse of History, holds in her hand a roll of
  parchment, and wears a wreath of laurel.

  MELPOMENE, the muse of Tragedy, bears a tragic mask.

  THALIA, the muse of Comedy, carries in her right hand a
  shepherd's crook, and has a comic mask beside her.

  POLYHYMNIA, the muse of Sacred Hymns, is crowned with a wreath
  of laurel. She is always represented in a thoughtful attitude, and
  entirely enveloped in rich folds of drapery.

  TERPSICHORE, the muse of Dance and Roundelay, is represented in
  the act of playing on a seven-stringed lyre.

  URANIA, the muse of Astronomy, stands erect, and bears in her
  left hand a celestial globe.

  EUTERPE, the muse of Harmony, is represented bearing a musical
  instrument, usually a flute.

  ERATO, the muse of Love and hymeneal songs, wears a wreath of
  laurel, and is striking the chords of a lyre.  span

  With regard to the origin of the Muses, it is said that they were
  created by Zeus in answer to a request on the part of the victorious
  deities, after the war with the  a

  should be called into existence, in order to commemorate in song the
  glorious deeds of the Olympian gods.

PEGASUS.

  Pegasus was a beautiful winged horse who sprang from the body of
  Medusa when she was slain by the hero Perseus, the son of Zeus and Danaë.
  Spreading out his wings he immediately flew to the top of Mount Olympus,
  where he was received with delight and admiration by all the immortals. A
  place in his palace was assigned to him by Zeus, who employed him to
  carry his thunder and lightning. Pegasus permitted none but the gods to
  mount him, except in the case of Bellerophon, whom, at the command of
  Athene, he carried aloft, in order that he might slay the Chimæra with
  his arrows.

  The later poets represent Pegasus as being at the service of the
  Muses, and for this reason he is more celebrated in modern times than in
  antiquity. He would appear to represent that poetical inspiration, which
  tends to develop man's higher nature, and causes the mind to soar
  heavenwards. The only mention by the ancients of Pegasus in connection
  with the Muses, is the story of his having produced with his hoofs, the
  famous fountain Hippocrene.

  It is said that during their contest with the Pierides, the Muses
  played and sang on the summit of Mount Helicon with such extraordinary
  power and sweetness, that heaven and earth stood still to listen, whilst
  the mountain raised itself in joyous ecstasy towards the abode of the
  celestial gods. Poseidon, seeing his special function thus interfered
  with, sent Pegasus to check the boldness of the mountain, in daring to
  move without his permission. When Pegasus reached the summit, he stamped
  the ground with his hoofs, and out gushed the waters of Hippocrene,
  afterwards so renowned as the sacred fount, whence the Muses quaffed
  their richest draughts of inspiration.

THE HESPERIDES.

  The Hesperides, the daughters of Atlas, dwelt in an island in the far
  west, whence they derived their name.  span
  class="pagenum">[163]

  They were appointed by Hera to act as guardians to a tree bearing
  golden apples, which had been presented to her by Gæa on the occasion of
  her marriage with Zeus.

  It is said that the Hesperides, being unable to withstand the
  temptation of tasting the golden fruit confided to their care, were
  deprived of their office, which was henceforth delegated to the terrible
  dragon Ladon, who now became the ever-watchful sentinel of these precious
  treasures.

  The names of the Hesperides were Aegle, Arethusa, and Hesperia.

CHARITES (Gratiæ) GRACES.

  All those gentler attributes which beautify and refine human existence
  were personified by the Greeks under the form of three lovely sisters,
  Euphrosyne, Aglaia, and Thalia, the daughters of Zeus and Eurynome (or,
  according to later writers, of Dionysus and Aphrodite).

  They are represented as beautiful, slender maidens in the full bloom
  of youth, with hands and arms lovingly intertwined, and are either
  undraped, or wear a fleecy, transparent garment of an ethereal
  fabric.

  They portray every gentle emotion of the heart, which vents itself in
  friendship and benevolence, and were believed to preside over those
  qualities which constitute grace, modesty, unconscious beauty,
  gentleness, kindliness, innocent joy, purity of mind and body, and
  eternal youth.

  They not only possessed the most perfect beauty themselves, but also
  conferred this gift upon others. All the enjoyments of life were enhanced
  by their presence, and were deemed incomplete without them; and wherever
  joy or pleasure, grace and gaiety reigned, there they were supposed to be
  present.

  Temples and altars were everywhere erected in their honour, and people
  of all ages and of every rank in life entreated their favour. Incense was
  burnt daily upon their altars, and at every banquet they were invoked,
   a
  name="page164">[164]and a libation poured out to them, as they
  not only heightened all enjoyment, but also by their refining influence
  moderated the exciting effects of wine.

  Music, eloquence, poetry, and art, though the direct work of the
  Muses, received at the hands of the Graces an additional touch of
  refinement and beauty; for which reason they are always regarded as the
  friends of the Muses, with whom they lived on Mount Olympus.

  Their special function was to act, in conjunction with the Seasons, as
  attendants upon Aphrodite, whom they adorned with wreaths of flowers, and
  she emerges from their hands like the Queen of Spring, perfumed with the
  odour of roses and violets, and all sweet-scented blossoms.

  The Graces are frequently seen in attendance on other divinities; thus
  they carry music for Apollo, myrtles for Aphrodite,      c., and
  frequently accompany the Muses, Eros, or Dionysus.

HORÆ (Seasons).

  Closely allied to the Graces were the Horæ, or Seasons, who were also
  represented as three beautiful maidens, daughters of Zeus and Themis.
  Their names were Eunomia, Dice, and Irene.

  It may appear strange that these divinities, presiding over the
  seasons, should be but three in number, but this is quite in accordance
  with the notions of the ancient Greeks, who only recognized spring,
  summer, and autumn as seasons; nature being supposed to be wrapt in death
  or slumber, during that cheerless and unproductive portion of the year
  which we call winter. In some parts of Greece there were but two Horæ,
  Thallo, goddess of the bloom, and Carpo, of the corn and fruit-bearing
  season.

  The Horæ are always regarded as friendly towards mankind, and totally
  devoid of guile or subtlety; they are represented as joyous, but gentle
  maidens, crowned with flowers, and holding each other by the hand in a
  round dance. When they are depicted separately as personifications of the
  different seasons, the Hora  a
  name="page165">[165]representing spring appears laden with
  flowers, that of summer bears a sheaf of corn, whilst the personification
  of autumn has her hands filled with clusters of grapes and other fruits.
  They also appear in company with the Graces in the train of Aphrodite,
  and are seen with Apollo and the Muses.

  They are inseparably connected with all that is good and beautiful in
  nature, and as the regular alternation of the seasons, like all her other
  operations, demands the most perfect order and regularity, the Horæ,
  being the daughters of Themis, came to be regarded as the representatives
  of order, and the just administration of human affairs in civilized
  communities. Each of these graceful maidens took upon herself a separate
  function: Eunomia presided more especially over state life, Dice guarded
  the interests of individuals, whilst Irene, the gayest and brightest of
  the three sisters, was the light-hearted companion of Dionysus.

  The Horæ were also the deities of the fast-fleeting hours, and thus
  presided over the smaller, as well as the larger divisions of time. In
  this capacity they assist every morning in yoking the celestial horses to
  the glorious chariot of the sun, which they again help to unyoke when he
  sinks to rest.

  In their original conception they were personifications of the clouds,
  and are described as opening and closing the gates of heaven, and causing
  fruits and flowers to spring forth, when they pour down upon them their
  refreshing and life-giving streams.

THE NYMPHS.

  The graceful beings called the Nymphs were the presiding deities of
  the woods, grottoes, streams, meadows,      c.

  These divinities were supposed to be beautiful maidens of fairy-like
  form, and robed in more or less shadowy garments. They were held in the
  greatest veneration, though, being minor divinities, they had no temples
   a
  name="page166">[166]dedicated to them, but were worshipped in
  caves or grottoes, with libations of milk, honey, oil,      c.

  They may be divided into three distinct classes, viz., water,
  mountain, and tree or wood nymphs.

WATER NYMPHS.

OCEANIDES, NEREIDES, AND NAIADES.

  The worship of water-deities is common to most primitive nations. The
  streams, springs, and fountains of a country bear the same relation to it
  which the blood, coursing through the numberless arteries of a human
  being, bears to the body; both represent the living, moving,
  life-awakening element, without which existence would be impossible.
  Hence we find among most nations a deep feeling of attachment to the
  streams and waters of their native land, the remembrance of which, when
  absent in foreign climes, is always treasured with peculiar fondness.
  Thus among the early Greeks, each tribe came to regard the rivers and
  springs of its individual state as beneficent powers, which brought
  blessing and prosperity to the country. It is probable also that the
  charm which ever accompanies the sound of running water exercised its
  power over their imagination. They heard with delight the gentle whisper
  of the fountain, lulling the senses with its low, rippling tones; the
  soft purling of the brook as it rushes over the pebbles, or the mighty
  voice of the waterfall as it dashes on in its headlong course; and the
  beings which they pictured to themselves as presiding over all these
  charming sights and sounds of nature, corresponded, in their graceful
  appearance, with the scenes with which they were associated.

OCEANIDES.

  The Oceanides, or Ocean Nymphs, were the
  daughters of Oceanus and Tethys, and, like most sea divinities, were
  endowed with the gift of prophecy.

  They are personifications of those delicate vapour-like  !-- Page 167
  -->[167]exhalations,
  which, in warm climates, are emitted from the surface of the sea, more
  especially at sunset, and are impelled forwards by the evening breeze.
  They are accordingly represented as misty, shadowy beings, with graceful
  swaying forms, and robed in pale blue, gauze-like fabrics.

THE NEREIDES.

  The Nereides were the daughters of Nereus and
  Doris, and were nymphs of the Mediterranean Sea.

  They are similar in appearance to the Oceanides, but their beauty is
  of a less shadowy order, and is more like that of mortals. They wear a
  flowing, pale green robe; their liquid eyes resemble, in their clear
  depths, the lucid waters of the sea they inhabit; their hair floats
  carelessly over their shoulders, and assumes the greenish tint of the
  water itself, which, far from deteriorating from their beauty, greatly
  adds to its effect. The Nereides either accompany the chariot of the
  mighty ruler of the sea, or follow in his train.

  We are told by the poets that the lonely mariner watches the Nereides
  with silent awe and wondering delight, as they rise from their
  grotto-palaces in the deep, and dance, in joyful groups, over the
  sleeping waves. Some, with arms entwined, follow with their movements the
  melodies which seem to hover over the sea, whilst others scatter liquid
  gems around, these being emblematical of the phosphorescent light, so
  frequently observed at night by the traveller in southern waters.

  The best known of the Nereides were Thetis, the wife of Peleus,
  Amphitrite, the spouse of Poseidon, and Galatea, the beloved of Acis.

THE NAIADES.

  The Naiades were the nymphs of fresh-water
  springs, lakes, brooks, rivers,      c.

  As the trees, plants, and flowers owed their nourishment to their
  genial, fostering care, these divinities were  span
  class="pagenum">[168]regarded by the Greeks
  as special benefactors to mankind. Like all the nymphs, they possessed
  the gift of prophecy, for which reason many of the springs and fountains
  over which they presided were believed to inspire mortals who drank of
  their waters with the power of foretelling future events. The Naiades are
  intimately connected in idea with those flowers which are called after
  them Nymphæ, or water-lilies, whose broad, green leaves and yellow cups
  float upon the surface of the water, as though proudly conscious of their
  own grace and beauty.

  We often hear of the Naiades forming alliances with mortals, and also
  of their being wooed by the sylvan deities of the woods and dales.

DRYADES, OR TREE NYMPHS.

  The tree nymphs partook of the distinguishing characteristics of the
  particular tree to whose life they were wedded, and were known
  collectively by the name of the Dryades.

  The Hamadryades, or oak nymphs, represent in
  their peculiar individuality the quiet, self-reliant power which appears
  to belong essentially to the grand and lordly king of the forest.

  The Birch Nymph is a melancholy maiden with
  floating hair, resembling the branches of the pale and fragile-looking
  tree which she inhabits.

  The Beech Nymph is strong and sturdy, full of
  life and joyousness, and appears to give promise of faithful love and
  undisturbed repose, whilst her rosy cheeks, deep brown eyes, and graceful
  form bespeak health, vigour, and vitality.

  The nymph of the Linden Tree is represented as
  a little coy maiden, whose short silver-gray dress reaches a little below
  the knee, and displays to advantage her delicately formed limbs. The
  sweet face, which is partly averted, reveals a pair of large blue eyes,
  which appear to look at you with wondering surprise and shy mistrust;
   a
  name="page169">[169]her pale, golden hair is bound by the
  faintest streak of rose-coloured ribbon.

  The tree nymph, being wedded to the life of the tree she inhabited,
  ceased to exist when it was either felled, or so injured as to wither
  away and die.

NYMPHS OF THE VALLEYS AND MOUNTAINS.

NAPÆÆ AND OREADES.

  The Napææ were the kind and gentle nymphs of the valleys and glens who
  appear in the train of Artemis. They are represented as lovely maidens
  with short tunics, which, reaching only to the knee, do not impede their
  swift and graceful movements in the exercise of the chase. Their pale
  brown tresses are fastened in a knot at the back of the head, whence a
  few stray curls escape over their shoulders. The Napææ are shy as the
  fawns, and quite as frolicsome.

  The Oreades, or mountain nymphs, who are the
  principal and constant companions of Artemis, are tall, graceful maidens,
  attired as huntresses. They are ardent followers of the chase, and spare
  neither the gentle deer nor the timid hare, nor indeed any animal they
  meet with in their rapid course. Wherever their wild hunt goes the shy
  Napææ are represented as hiding behind the leaves, whilst their
  favourites, the fawns, kneel tremblingly beside them, looking up
  beseechingly for protection from the wild huntresses; and even the bold
  Satyrs dart away at their approach, and seek safety in flight.

  There is a myth connected with one of these mountain nymphs, the
  unfortunate Echo. She became enamoured of a beautiful youth named
  Narcissus, son of the river-god Cephissus, who, however, failed to return
  her love, which so grieved her that she gradually pined away, becoming a
  mere shadow of her former self, till, at length, nothing remained of her
  except her voice, which henceforth gave back, with unerring fidelity,
  every sound that was uttered in the hills and dales. Narcissus himself
   a
  name="page170">[170]also met with an unhappy fate, for
  Aphrodite punished him by causing him to fall in love with his own image,
  which he beheld in a neighbouring fountain, whereupon, consumed with
  unrequited love, he wasted away, and was changed into the flower which
  bears his name.

  The Limoniades, or meadow nymphs, resemble the
  Naiades, and are usually represented dancing hand in hand in a
  circle.

  The Hyades, who in appearance are somewhat
  similar to the Oceanides, are cloudy divinities, and, from the fact of
  their being invariably accompanied by rain, are represented as
  incessantly weeping.

  The Meliades were the nymphs who presided over
  fruit-trees.

  Before concluding this subject, attention should be drawn to the fact
  that, in more modern times, this beautiful idea of animating all nature
  in detail reappears under the various local traditions extant in
  different countries. Thus do the Oceanides and Nereides live again in the
  mermaids, whose existence is still believed in by mariners, whilst the
  flower and meadow nymphs assume the shape of those tiny elves and
  fairies, who were formerly believed to hold their midnight revels in
  every wood and on every common; indeed, even at the present day, the
  Irish peasantry, especially in the west, firmly believe in the existence
  of the fairies, or "good people," as they are called.

THE WINDS.

  According to the oldest accounts, Æolus was a king of the Æolian
  Islands, to whom Zeus gave the command of the winds, which he kept shut
  up in a deep cave, and which he freed at his pleasure, or at the command
  of the gods.

  In later times the above belief underwent a change, and the winds came
  to be regarded as distinct divinities, whose aspect accorded with the
  respective winds with which they were identified. They were depicted as
   a
  name="page171">[171]winged youths in full vigour in the act of
  flying through the air.

  The principal winds were: Boreas (the north wind), Eurus (the east
  wind), Zephyrus (the west wind), and Notus (the south wind), who were
  said to be the children of Eos and Astræus.

  There are no myths of interest connected with these divinities.
  Zephyrus was united to Chloris (Flora), the goddess of flowers. Of Boreas
  it is related that while flying over the river Ilissus, he beheld on the
  banks Oreithyia, the charming daughter of Erechtheus, king of Athens,
  whom he carried off to his native Thrace, and there made her his bride.
  Boreas and Oreithyia were the parents of Zetes and Calais, afterwards
  famous in the expedition of the Argonauts.

  There was an altar erected at Athens in honour of Boreas, in
  commemoration of his having destroyed the Persian fleet sent to attack
  the Greeks.

  On the Acropolis at Athens there was a celebrated octagonal temple,
  built by Pericles, which was dedicated to the winds, and on its sides
  were their various representations. The ruins of this temple are still to
  be seen.

PAN (Faunus).

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0171-1.png"
      alt="Pan and Syrinx" title="Pan and Syrinx" />
  
  Pan was the god of fertility, and the special patron of shepherds and
  huntsmen; he presided over all rural occupations, was chief of the
  Satyrs, and head of all rural divinities.

  According to the common belief, he was the son of Hermes and a wood
  nymph, and came into the world with horns sprouting from his forehead, a
  goat's beard and a crooked nose, pointed ears, and the tail and feet of a
  goat, and presented altogether so repulsive  span
  class="pagenum">[172]an appearance that, at
  the sight of him, his mother fled in dismay.

  Hermes, however, took up his curious little offspring, wrapt him in a
  hare skin, and carried him in his arms to Olympus. The grotesque form and
  merry antics of the little stranger made him a great favourite with all
  the immortals, especially Dionysus; and they bestowed upon him the name
  of Pan (all), because he had delighted them all.

  His favourite haunts were grottoes, and his delight was to wander in
  uncontrolled freedom over rocks and mountains, following his various
  pursuits, ever cheerful, and usually very noisy. He was a great lover of
  music, singing, dancing, and all pursuits which enhance the pleasures of
  life; and hence, in spite of his repulsive appearance, we see him
  surrounded with nymphs of the forests and dales, who love to dance round
  him to the cheerful music of his pipe, the syrinx. The myth concerning
  the origin of Pan's pipe is as follows:       Pan became enamoured of a
  beautiful nymph, called Syrinx, who, appalled at his terrible appearance,
  fled from the pertinacious attentions of her unwelcome suitor. He pursued
  her to the banks of the river Ladon, when, seeing his near approach, and
  feeling escape impossible, she called on the gods for assistance, who, in
  answer to her prayer, transformed her into a reed, just as Pan was about
  to seize her. Whilst the love-sick Pan was sighing and lamenting his
  unfortunate fate, the winds gently swayed the reeds, and produced a
  murmuring sound as of one complaining. Charmed with the soothing tones,
  he endeavoured to reproduce them himself, and after cutting seven of the
  reeds of unequal length, he joined them together, and succeeded in
  producing the pipe, which he called the syrinx, in memory of his lost
  love.

  Pan was regarded by shepherds as their most valiant protector, who
  defended their flocks from the attacks of wolves. The shepherds of these
  early times, having no penfolds, were in the habit of gathering together
  their flocks in mountain caves, to protect them against the  !-- Page 173
  -->[173]inclemency of
  the weather, and also to secure them at night against the attacks of wild
  animals; these caves, therefore, which were very numerous in the mountain
  districts of Arcadia, B       otia,      c., were all consecrated to
  Pan.

  As it is customary in all tropical climates to repose during the heat
  of the day, Pan is represented as greatly enjoying his afternoon sleep in
  the cool shelter of a tree or cave, and also as being highly displeased
  at any sound which disturbed his slumbers, for which reason the shepherds
  were always particularly careful to keep unbroken silence during these
  hours, whilst they themselves indulged in a quiet siesta.

  Pan was equally beloved by huntsmen, being himself a great lover of
  the woods, which afforded to his cheerful and active disposition full
  scope, and in which he loved to range at will. He was regarded as the
  patron of the chase, and the rural sportsmen, returning from an
  unsuccessful day's sport, beat, in token of their displeasure, the wooden
  image of Pan, which always occupied a prominent place in their
  dwellings.

  All sudden and unaccountable sounds which startle travellers in lonely
  spots, were attributed to Pan, who possessed a frightful and most
  discordant voice; hence the term panic terror, to indicate sudden
  fear. The Athenians ascribed their victory at Marathon to the alarm which
  he created among the Persians by his terrible voice.

  Pan was gifted with the power of prophecy, which he is said to have
  imparted to Apollo, and he possessed a well-known and very ancient oracle
  in Arcadia, in which state he was more especially worshipped.

  The artists of later times have somewhat toned down the original very
  unattractive conception of Pan, as above described, and merely represent
  him as a young man, hardened by the exposure to all weathers which a
  rural life involves, and bearing in his hand the shepherd's crook and
  syrinx       these being his usual attributes       whilst small horns
  project from his forehead. He is either undraped, or wears merely the
  light cloak called the chlamys.

  The usual offerings to Pan were milk and honey in  !-- Page 174
  -->[174]shepherds'
  bowls. Cows, lambs, and rams were also sacrificed to him.

  After the introduction of Pan into the worship of Dionysus, we hear of
  a number of little Pans (Panisci), who are sometimes confounded with the
  Satyrs.

FAUNUS.

  The Romans had an old Italian divinity called Faunus, who, as the god
  of shepherds, was identified with the Greek Pan, and represented in a
  similar manner.

  Faunus is frequently called Inuus or the fertilizer, and Lupercus or
  the one who wards off wolves. Like Pan, he possessed the gift of
  prophecy, and was the presiding spirit of the woods and fields; he also
  shared with his Greek prototype the faculty of alarming travellers in
  solitary places. Bad dreams and evil apparitions were attributed to
  Faunus, and he was believed to enter houses stealthily at night for this
  purpose.

  Fauna was the wife of Faunus, and participated in his functions.

THE SATYRS.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0175-1.png"
      alt="A Satyr" title="A Satyr" />
  
  The Satyrs were a race of woodland spirits, who evidently personified
  the free, wild, and untrammelled life of the forest. Their appearance was
  both grotesque and repulsive; they had flat broad noses, pointed ears,
  and little horns sprouting from their foreheads, a rough shaggy skin, and
  small goat's tails. They led a life of pleasure and self-indulgence,
  followed the chase, revelled in every description of wild music and
  dancing, were terrible wine-bibbers, and addicted to the deep slumbers
  which follow heavy potations. They were no less dreaded by mortals than
  by the gentle woodland nymphs, who always avoided their coarse rough
  sports.

  The Satyrs were conspicuous figures in the train of Dionysus, and, as
  we have seen, Silenus their chief was tutor to the wine god. The older
  Satyrs were called Silens, and are represented in antique sculpture, as
  more nearly approaching the human form.

[175]

  In addition to the ordinary Satyrs, artists delighted in depicting
  little Satyrs, young imps, frolicking about the woods in a marvellous
  variety of droll attitudes. These little fellows greatly resemble their
  friends and companions, the Panisci.

  In rural districts it was customary for the shepherds and peasants who
  attended the festivals of Dionysus, to dress themselves in the skins of
  goats and other animals, and, under this disguise, they permitted
  themselves all kinds of playful tricks and excesses, to which
  circumstance the conception of the Satyrs is by some authorities
  attributed.

  In Rome the old Italian wood-divinities, the FAUNS, who had goats'
  feet and all other characteristics of the Satyrs greatly exaggerated,
  were identified with them.

PRIAPUS.

  Priapus, the son of Dionysus and Aphrodite, was regarded as the god of
  fruitfulness, the protector of flocks, sheep, goats, bees, the fruit of
  the vine, and all garden produce.

  His statues, which were set up in gardens and vineyards, acted not
  only as objects of worship, but also as scarecrows, the appearance of
  this god being especially repulsive and unsightly. These statues were
  formed of wood or stone, and from the hips downwards were merely rude
  columns. They represent him as having a red and very ugly face; he bears
  in his hand a pruning knife, and his head is crowned with a wreath of
  vine and laurel. He usually carries fruit in his garments or a cornucopia
  in his hand, always, however, retaining his singularly revolting aspect.
  It is said that Hera, wishing  a
  name="page176">[176]to punish Aphrodite, sent her this
  misshapen and unsightly son, and that when he was born, his mother was so
  horrified at the sight of him, that she ordered him to be exposed on the
  mountains, where he was found by some shepherds, who, taking pity on him,
  saved his life.

  This divinity was chiefly worshipped at Lampsacus, his birthplace.
  Asses were sacrificed to him, and he received the first-fruits of the
  fields and gardens, with a libation of milk and honey.

  The worship of Priapus was introduced into Rome at the same time as
  that of Aphrodite, and was identified with a native Italian divinity
  named Mutunus.

ASCLEPIAS (Æsculapius).

  Asclepias, the god of the healing art, was the son of Apollo and the
  nymph Coronis. He was educated by the noble Centaur Chiron, who
  instructed him in all knowledge, but more especially in that of the
  properties of herbs. Asclepias searched out the hidden powers of plants,
  and discovered cures for the various diseases which afflict the human
  body. He brought his art to such perfection, that he not only succeeded
  in warding off death, but also restored the dead to life. It was
  popularly believed that he was materially assisted in his wonderful cures
  by the blood of the Medusa, given to him by Pallas-Athene.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0177-1.png"
      alt="Asclepias" title="Asclepias" />
  
  It is well to observe that the shrines of this divinity, which were
  usually built in healthy places, on hills outside the town, or near wells
  which were believed to have healing powers, offered at the same time
  means of cure for the sick and suffering, thus combining religious with
  sanitary influences. It was the custom for the sufferer to sleep in the
  temple, when, if he had been earnest in his devotions, Asclepias appeared
  to him in a dream, and revealed the means to be employed for the cure of
  his malady. On the walls of these temples were hung tablets, inscribed by
  the different pilgrims with the particulars of their maladies, the
  remedies practised, and the cures  span
  class="pagenum">[177]worked by the
  god:       a custom undoubtedly productive of most beneficial
  results.

  Groves, temples, and altars were dedicated to Asclepias in many parts
  of Greece, but Epidaurus, the chief seat of his worship,       where,
  indeed, it is said to have originated,       contained his principal
  temple, which served at the same time as a hospital.

  The statue of Asclepias in the temple at Epidaurus was formed of ivory
  and gold, and represented him as an old man with a full beard, leaning on
  a staff round which a serpent is climbing. The serpent was the
  distinguishing symbol of this divinity, partly because these reptiles
  were greatly used by the ancients in the cure of diseases, and partly
  also because all the prudence and wisdom of the serpent were deemed
  indispensable to the judicious physician.

  His usual attributes are a staff, a bowl, a bunch of herbs, a
  pineapple, a dog, and a serpent.

  His children inherited, for the most part, the distinguished talents
  of their father. Two of his sons, Machaon and Podalirius, accompanied
  Agamemnon to the Trojan war, in which expedition they became renowned,
  not only as military heroes, but also as skilful physicians.

  Their sisters, HYGEIA (health), and PANACEA
  (all-healing), had temples dedicated to them, and received divine
  honours. The function of Hygeia was to maintain the health of the
  community, which great blessing was supposed to be brought by her as a
  direct and beneficent gift from the gods.

ÆSCULAPIUS.

  The worship of Æsculapius was introduced into Rome from Epidaurus,
  whence the statue of the god of healing  span
  class="pagenum">[178]was brought at the time
  of a great pestilence. Grateful for their deliverance from this plague,
  the Romans erected a temple in his honour, on an island near the mouth of
  the Tiber.



ROMAN DIVINITIES.

JANUS.

  From the earliest ages Janus was regarded by the Romans with the
  utmost affection and veneration, as a divinity who ranked only second to
  Jupiter himself, and through whom all prayers and petitions were
  transmitted to the other gods.

  He was believed to preside over the beginnings of all things, hence it
  was he who inaugurated the years, months, and seasons, and in course of
  time came to be considered as specially protecting the beginnings of all
  human enterprises. The great importance which the Romans attached to an
  auspicious commencement, as contributing to the ultimate success of an
  enterprise, accounts for the high estimation in which Janus was held as
  the god of beginnings.

  This divinity would appear to have been the ancient sun-god of the
  Italian tribes, in which capacity he opens and closes the gates of heaven
  every morning and evening. Hence he was regarded as the door-keeper of
  heaven, and also as the presiding deity over all gates, entrances,
       c., on earth.

  The fact of his being the god of city gates, which were called Jani
  after him, is ascribed, however, to the following myth:       After the
  abduction of their women by the Romans, the Sabines, in revenge, invaded
  the Roman state, and were already about to enter the gates of the city,
  when suddenly a hot sulphur spring, which was believed to have been sent
  by Janus for their special preservation, gushed forth from the earth, and
  arrested the progress of the enemy.

[179]

  In his character as guardian of gates and doors, he was also regarded
  as a protecting deity of the home, for which reason little shrines were
  erected to him over the doors of houses, which contained an image of the
  god, having two faces.

  Janus possessed no temples in the ordinary acceptation of the word,
  but all the gates of cities were dedicated to him. Close to the Forum of
  Rome stood the so-called temple of Janus, which, however, was merely an
  arched passage, closed by massive gates. This temple was open only in
  time of war, as it was supposed that the god had then taken his departure
  with the Roman army, over whose welfare he personally presided. It is
  worthy of notice, as an evidence of the many wars in which the Romans
  were engaged, that the gates of this sanctuary were only closed three
  times during 700 years.

  As the god who ushers in the new year, the first month was called
  after him, and on the 1st of January his most important festival was
  celebrated, on which occasion all entrances of public and private
  buildings were decorated with laurel branches and garlands of
  flowers.

  His sacrifices, consisting of cakes, wine, and barley, were offered to
  him at the beginning of every month; and before sacrificing to the other
  gods his name was always invoked, and a libation poured out to him.

  Janus is usually represented with two faces; in his special function
  as door-keeper of heaven he stands erect, bearing a key in one hand, and
  a rod or sceptre in the other.

  It is supposed that Janus was the most ancient king of Italy, who,
  during his life, governed his subjects with such wisdom and moderation
  that, in gratitude for the benefits conferred upon them, his people
  deified him after death and placed him in the foremost rank among their
  divinities. We have already seen in the history of Cronus that Saturn,
  who was identified with the Greek Cronus (god of time), was the friend
  and colleague of Janus. Anxious to prove his gratitude to his benefactor,
  Cronus endowed him with the knowledge of past and future  !-- Page 180
  -->[180]events, which
  enabled him to adopt the wisest measures for the welfare of his subjects,
  and it is on this account that Janus is represented with two faces
  looking in opposite directions, the one to the past, the other to the
  future.

FLORA.

  Flora was the goddess of flowers, and was regarded as a beneficent
  power, who watched over and protected the early blossoms.

  She was held in the highest estimation by the Romans, and a festival,
  called the Floralia, was celebrated in her honour from the 28th of April
  to the 1st of May. This festival was a season of universal merriment, in
  which flowers were used profusely in adorning houses, streets,      c.,
  and were worn by young girls in their hair.

  Flora, who typified the season of Spring, is generally represented as
  a lovely maiden, garlanded with flowers.

ROBIGUS.

  In opposition to Flora we find an antagonistic divinity, called
  Robigus, a worker of evil, who delighted in the destruction of the tender
  herbs by mildew, and whose wrath could only be averted by prayers and
  sacrifices, when he was invoked under the title of Averuncus, or the
  Avertor.

  The festival of Robigus (the Robigalia) was celebrated on the 25th of
  April.

POMONA.

  Pomona was the goddess of orchards and fruit-trees, who, according to
  Ovid, cares not for woods or streams, but loves her gardens and the
  boughs that bear the thriving fruit.

  Pomona, who typifies Autumn, is represented as a lovely maiden, laden
  with branches of fruit-trees.

[181]

VERTUMNUS.

  Vertumnus was the god of garden and field produce. He personifies the
  change of seasons, and that process of transformation in nature by means
  of which the leaf-buds become developed into blossoms, and the blossoms
  into fruit.

  The change of seasons is symbolized in a myth which represents
  Vertumnus as metamorphosing himself into a variety of different forms in
  order to gain the affection of Pomona, who so loved her vocation that she
  abjured all thoughts of marriage. He first appears to her as a ploughman,
  typifying Spring; then as a reaper, to represent Summer; afterwards as a
  vine-gatherer, to indicate Autumn; and finally as a gray-haired old
  woman, symbolical of the snows of Winter; but it was not until he assumed
  his true form, that of a beautiful youth, that he succeeded in his
  suit.

  Vertumnus is generally represented crowned with wheat-sheaves, and
  bearing in his hand a cornucopia.

PALES.

  Pales, a very ancient Italian divinity, is represented sometimes as a
  male, sometimes as a female power.

  As a male divinity he is more particularly the god of shepherds and
  flocks.

  As a female deity, Pales presides over husbandry and the fruitfulness
  of herds. Her festivals, the Palilia, were celebrated on the 21st of
  April, the day on which the city of Rome was founded. During this
  festival it was customary for shepherds to ignite a mass of straw,
  through which they rushed with their flocks, believing that this ordeal
  would purify them from sin.

  The name Palatine, which originally signified a pastoral colony, is
  derived from this divinity. Her offerings were cakes and milk.

[182]

PICUS.

  Picus, the son of Saturn and father of Faunus, was a woodland
  divinity, gifted with prophetic powers.

  An ancient myth relates that Picus was a beautiful youth, united to a
  nymph called Canens. The sorceress Circe, infatuated by his beauty,
  endeavoured to secure his love, but he rejected her advances, and she, in
  revenge, changed him into a woodpecker, under which form he still
  retained his powers of prophecy.

  Picus is represented as a youth, with a woodpecker perched upon his
  head, which bird became henceforth regarded as possessed of the power of
  prophecy.

PICUMNUS AND PILUMNUS.

  Picumnus and Pilumnus were two household divinities of the Romans, who
  were the special presiding deities of new-born infants.

SILVANUS.

  Silvanus was a woodland divinity, who, like Faunus, greatly resembled
  the Greek Pan. He was the presiding deity of plantations and forests, and
  specially protected the boundaries of fields.

  Silvanus is represented as a hale old man, carrying a cypress-tree,
  for, according to Roman mythology, the transformation of the youth
  Cyparissus into the tree which bears his name was attributed to him.

  His sacrifices consisted of milk, meat, wine, grapes, wheat-ears, and
  pigs.

TERMINUS.

  Terminus was the god who presided over all boundaries and
  landmarks.

  He was originally represented by a simple block of stone, which in
  later times became surmounted by a  span
  class="pagenum">[183]head of this divinity.
  Numa Pompilius, the great benefactor of his people, anxious to inculcate
  respect for the rights of property, specially enjoined the erection of
  these blocks of stone, as a durable monument to mark the line dividing
  one property from another. He also caused altars to be raised to
  Terminus, and instituted his festival (the Terminalia), which was
  celebrated on the 23rd of February.

  Upon one occasion, when Tarquin wished to remove the altars of several
  deities, in order to build a new temple, it is said that Terminus and
  Juventas alone objected to being displaced. This obstinate refusal on
  their part was interpreted as a good omen, signifying that the city of
  Rome would never lose her boundaries, and would remain ever young and
  vigorous.

CONSUS.

  Consus was the god of secret counsel.

  The Romans believed that when an idea developed itself spontaneously
  within the mind of an individual, it was Consus who had prompted the
  suggestion. This applied, however, more particularly to plans which
  resulted satisfactorily.

  An altar was erected to this divinity on the Circus Maximus, which was
  kept always covered, except during his festival, the Consualia, which was
  celebrated on the 18th of August.

LIBITINA.

  Libitina was the goddess who presided over funerals. This divinity was
  identified with Venus, possibly because the ancients considered that the
  power of love extended even to the realms of death.

  Her temple in Rome, which was erected by Servius Tullius, contained
  all the requisites for funerals, and these could either be bought or
  hired there. A register of all deaths which occurred in the city of Rome
  was kept in  a
  name="page184">[184]this temple, and in order to ascertain the
  rate of mortality, a piece of money was paid by command of Servius
  Tullius, on the demise of each person.

LAVERNA.

  Laverna was the presiding goddess of thieves, and of all artifice and
  fraud. There was an altar erected to her near the Porta Lavernalis, which
  was called after her, and she possessed a sacred grove on the Via
  Salavia.

COMUS.

  Comus was the presiding genius of banquets, festive scenes, revelry,
  and all joyous pleasures and reckless gaiety.

  He is represented as a young man crowned with flowers, his face heated
  and flushed with wine, leaning against a post in a half-sleepy and
  drunken attitude, with a torch falling from his hand.

THE CAMENÆ.

  The Camenæ were prophetic nymphs held in high veneration by the
  ancient Italians. They were four in number, the best known of whom are
  Carmenta and Egeria.

  Carmenta was celebrated as being the mother of Evander, who led an
  Arcadian colony into Italy, and founded a town on the river Tiber, which
  became afterwards incorporated with the city of Rome. Evander is said to
  have been the first who introduced Greek art and civilization into Italy,
  and also the worship of Greek divinities.

  A temple was erected to Carmenta on the Capitoline Hill, and a
  festival, called the Carmentalia, was celebrated in her honour on the
  11th of January.

  Egeria is said to have initiated Numa Pompilius in the forms of
  religious worship, which he introduced among his people. She was regarded
  as the giver of  a
  name="page185">[185]life, and was therefore invoked by women
  before the birth of their children.

  The Camenæ are frequently identified by Roman writers with the
  Muses.

GENII.

  A comforting and assuring belief existed among the Romans, that each
  individual was accompanied through life, from the hour of his birth to
  that of his death, by a protecting spirit, called his genius, who
  prompted him to good and noble deeds, and acted towards him as a guardian
  angel, comforting him in sorrow, and guiding him throughout his earthly
  career.

  In the course of time a second genius was believed to exist, of an
  evil nature, who, as the instigator of all wrong-doing, was ever at war
  with the beneficent genius; and on the issue of the conflict between
  these antagonistic influences, depended the fate of the individual. The
  genii were depicted as winged beings, greatly resembling our modern
  representations of guardian angels.

  Every state, town, or city, (as well as every man), possessed its
  special genius. The sacrifices to the genii consisted of wine, cakes, and
  incense, which were offered to them on birthdays.

  The genius which guided a woman was called, after the queen of heaven,
  Juno.

  Among the Greeks, beings called Dæmons were regarded as exercising
  similar functions to those of the Roman genii. They were believed to be
  the spirits of the righteous race which existed in the Golden Age, who
  watched over mankind, carrying their prayers to the gods, and the gifts
  of the gods to them.

MANES.

LEMURES (LARVÆ) AND LARES.

  The Manes were the spirits of the departed, and were of two kinds,
  viz., Lemures (or Larvæ) and Lares.  span
  class="pagenum">[186]

  The Lemures were those Manes who haunted their former abodes on earth
  as evil spirits, appearing at night under awful forms and hideous shapes,
  greatly to the alarm of their friends and relatives. They were so feared
  that a festival, called the Lemuralia, was celebrated in order to
  propitiate them.

  It appears extremely probable that the superstitions with regard to
  ghosts, haunted houses,      c., which exist even at the present day, owe
  their origin to this very ancient pagan source.

  The Lares Familiares were a much more pleasing conception. They were
  the spirits of the ancestors of each family, who exercised after death a
  protecting power over the well-being and prosperity of the family to
  which they had in life belonged. The place of honour beside the hearth
  was occupied by the statue of the Lar of the house, who was supposed to
  have been the founder of the family. This statue was the object of
  profound veneration, and was honoured on all occasions by every member of
  the family; a portion of each meal was laid before it, and it was
  believed to take an active part in all family affairs and domestic
  events, whether of a sad or joyful nature. Before starting on any
  expedition the master of the house saluted the statue of the Lar, and, on
  his return, a solemn thanksgiving was offered to this, the presiding
  deity of his hearth and home, in grateful acknowledgment of his
  protection; whereupon the statue was crowned with garlands of flowers,
  these being the favourite offerings to the Lares on all occasions of
  especial family rejoicing.

  The first act of a bride on entering her new abode was to do homage to
  the Lar, in the belief that he would exercise over her a protecting
  influence and shield her from evil.

  In addition to those above enumerated there were also public Lares,
  who were guardians of the state, highroads, country, and sea. Their
  temples were always open for any pious worshipper to enter, and on their
  altars public sacrifices were offered for the welfare of the state or
  city.  a
  name="page187">[187]

PENATES.

  The Penates were deities selected by each family, and frequently by
  its individual members, as a special protector. Various causes led to
  this selection. If, for instance, a child were born on the festival of
  Vesta, it was thought that that deity would henceforward act as its
  special guardian. If a youth possessed great business talents he adopted
  Mercury as his tutelary deity; should he, on the other hand, develop a
  passion for music, Apollo was selected as his patron god, and so forth.
  These became regarded as the special divinities of the household, small
  images of them adorned the surroundings of the hearth, and honours
  similar to those paid to the Lares were accorded to them.

  Just as there were public Lares so there were public Penates, which
  were worshipped by the Roman people under the form of two youthful
  warriors, who, in later times, were regarded as identical with Castor and
  Pollux. They are generally represented on horseback, with conical caps on
  their heads, and bearing long spears in their hands.

PUBLIC WORSHIP OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS
AND ROMANS.

TEMPLES.

  In very remote times the Greeks had no shrines or sanctuaries devoted
  to public worship, but performed their devotions beneath the vast and
  boundless canopy of heaven, in the great temple of nature itself.
  Believing that their divinities throned above the clouds, pious
  worshippers naturally sought the highest available points, in order to
  place themselves in the closest communion possible with their gods; hence
  the summits of high mountains were selected for devotional purposes, and
  the more exalted the rank and importance of the divinity invoked, the
  more elevated was the site selected for his or her worship. But the
  inconvenience attending this mode of worship gradually suggested the idea
  of erecting edifices which would afford means of shelter from the
  inclemency of the weather.

  These structures were, in the first instance, of the most simple form,
  and without decoration; but when, with the progress of civilization, the
  Greeks became a  a
  name="page189">[189]wealthy and powerful people, temples were
  built and adorned with the greatest splendour and magnificence, talent,
  labour, and wealth being lavished unsparingly on their erection and
  decoration; indeed so massively were they constructed, that some of them
  have, to a certain extent, withstood the ravages of time. The city of
  Athens especially contains numerous remains of these buildings of
  antiquity. On the Acropolis we may still behold, among other monuments of
  ancient art, the temple of Athene-Polias, and that of Theseus, the latter
  of which is the most entire ancient edifice in the world. In the island
  of Delos, also, are to be seen the ruins of the temples of Apollo and
  Artemis, both of which are in a wonderful state of preservation. These
  ruins are most valuable, being sufficiently complete to enable us to
  study, by their aid, the plan and character of the original
  structure.

  Among the Lacedæmonians, however, we find no vestiges of these stately
  temples, for they were specially enjoined by a law of Lycurgus to serve
  the gods with as little outlay as possible. When the great lawgiver was
  asked the reason of this injunction, he replied that the Lacedæmonians,
  being a poor nation, might otherwise abstain altogether from the
  observance of their religious duties, and wisely added that magnificent
  edifices and costly sacrifices were not so pleasing to the gods, as the
  true piety and unfeigned devotion of their worshippers.

  The most ancient temples known to us served a double purpose: they
  were not only consecrated to the service of the gods, but were at the
  same time venerable monuments in honour of the dead. Thus, for instance,
  the temple of Pallas-Athene, in the tower of the city of Larissa, served
  as the sepulchre of Acrisius, and the Acropolis at Athens received the
  ashes of Cecrops, founder of the city.

  A temple was frequently dedicated to two or more gods, and was always
  built after the manner considered most acceptable to the particular
  divinities to whom it was consecrated; for just as trees, birds, and
  animals of  a
  name="page190">[190]every description were held to be sacred
  to certain deities, so almost every god had a form of building peculiar
  to himself, which was deemed more acceptable to him than any other. Thus
  the Doric style of architecture was sacred to Zeus, Ares, and Heracles;
  the Ionic to Apollo, Artemis, and Dionysus; and the Corinthian to
  Hestia.

  In the porch of the temple stood a vessel of stone or brass,
  containing holy water (which had been consecrated by putting into it a
  burning torch, taken from the altar), with which all those admitted to
  take part in the sacrifices were besprinkled. In the inmost recess of the
  sanctuary was the most holy place, into which none but the priests were
  suffered to enter.

  Temples in the country were usually surrounded with groves of trees.
  The solitude of these shady retreats naturally tended to inspire the
  worshipper with awe and reverence, added to which the delightful shade
  and coolness afforded by tall leafy trees is peculiarly grateful in hot
  countries. Indeed so general did this custom of building temples in
  groves become, that all places devoted to sacred purposes, even where no
  trees existed, were called groves. That this practice must be of very
  remote antiquity is proved by the Biblical injunction, having for its
  object the separation of the Jews from all idolatrous practices: "Thou
  shalt not plant thee a grove of trees near unto the altar of the Lord thy
  God."

STATUES.

  The Greeks worshipped their gods without any visible representations
  of them until the time of Cecrops. The most ancient of these
  representations consisted of square blocks of stone, upon which the name
  of the deity intended to be represented was engraved. The first attempts
  at sculpture were rude stocks, with a head at one end and a shapeless
  trunk at the other, tapering slightly down to the feet, which, however,
  were not divided, the limbs being in no way defined. But the artists of
  later times devoted all their genius to the  span
  class="pagenum">[191]successful production
  of the highest ideals of their gods, some of which are preserved to this
  day, and are regarded as examples of purest art.

  On a pedestal in the centre of the edifice stood the statue of the
  divinity to whom the temple was dedicated, surrounded by images of other
  gods, all of which were fenced off by rails.

ALTARS.

  The altar in a Greek temple, which stood in the centre of the building
  and in front of the statue of the presiding deity, was generally of a
  circular form, and constructed of stone. It was customary to engrave upon
  it the name or distinguishing symbol of the divinity to whom it was
  dedicated; and it was held so sacred that if any malefactor fled to it
  his life was safe from his pursuers, and it was considered one of the
  greatest acts of sacrilege to force him from this asylum.

  The most ancient altars were adorned with horns, which in former times
  were emblems of power and dignity, as wealth, and consequently
  importance, consisted among most primitive nations in flocks and
  herds.

  In addition to those erected in places of public worship, altars were
  frequently raised in groves, on highways, or in the market-places of
  cities.

  The gods of the lower world had no altars whatever, ditches or
  trenches being dug for the reception of the blood of the sacrifices
  offered to them.

PRIESTS.

  In ancient times the priests were recognized as a special social
  caste, and were distinguished not only by their sacerdotal vestments, but
  also by their piety, wisdom, and blameless life. They were the chosen
  mediators between gods and men, and offered prayers and sacrifices in the
  name of the people, whom they also instructed as to what vows, gifts, and
  offerings would be most acceptable to the gods.

[192]

  Every deity had a different order of priests consecrated to his
  worship, and in every place a high-priest was appointed, whose duty it
  was to superintend the rest of his order, and also to carry out the more
  sacred rites and religious observances.

  Priests and priestesses were permitted to marry, but not a second
  time; some, however, voluntarily adopted a life of celibacy.

SACRIFICES.

  There is no doubt that a feeling of gratitude to the gods for their
  protecting care, and the abundance with which they were believed to bless
  mankind, has induced men of all nations and in all countries to feel a
  desire to sacrifice to their divinities some portion of the gifts so
  generously lavished upon them.

  Among the Greeks, sacrifices were of various kinds. They consisted of
  free-will offerings, propitiatory offerings,      c.

  Free-will offerings were grateful acknowledgments for benefits
  received, and usually consisted of the first-fruits of the field, or the
  finest of the flocks and herds, which were required to be without spot or
  blemish.

  Propitiatory offerings were brought with the object of
  appeasing the anger of the gods.

  In addition to those above enumerated, sacrifices were made, either
  with a view of obtaining success in an enterprise about to be undertaken,
  or in fulfilment of a vow, or at the command of an oracle.

  Every sacrifice was accompanied by salt and also by a libation, which
  usually consisted of wine, the cup being always filled to the brim,
  indicating that the offering was made without stint. When sacrificing to
  the infernal gods the cup containing the libation was filled with
  blood.

  The animals offered to the Olympian divinities were white, whilst
  those to the gods of the lower world were black. When a man offered a
  special sacrifice for himself or his family it partook of the nature of
  his  a
  name="page193">[193]occupation; thus a shepherd brought a
  sheep, a vine-grower his grapes, and so forth. But in the case of public
  sacrifices, the supposed individuality of the deity was always consulted.
  For instance, to Demeter a sow was offered, because that animal is apt to
  root up the seed-corn; to Dionysus a goat, on account of its being
  destructive to vineyards,      c.

  The value of offerings depended greatly upon the position of the
  individual; it being regarded as a contempt of the gods for a rich man to
  bring a sordid offering, whilst from a poor man the smallest oblation was
  considered acceptable.

  Hecatombs consisted of a hundred animals, and were offered by entire
  communities, or by wealthy individuals who either desired, or had
  obtained some special favour from the gods.

  When a sacrifice was to be offered, a fire was kindled on the altar,
  into which wine and frankincense were poured, in order to increase the
  flame. In very ancient times, the victim was laid upon the altar and
  burned whole; but after the time of Prometheus portions only of the
  shoulders, thighs, entrails,      c., were sacrificed, the remainder
  becoming the perquisites of the priests.

  The officiating priests wore a crown composed of the leaves of the
  tree sacred to the deity they invoked. Thus when sacrificing to Apollo
  the crowns were of laurel; when to Heracles, of poplar. This practice of
  wearing crowns was, at a later period, adopted by the general public at
  banquets and other festivities.

  On occasions of special solemnity the horns of the victim were
  overlaid with gold, and the altars decked with flowers and sacred
  herbs.

  The mode of conducting the sacrifices was as follows:       All things
  being prepared, a salt cake, the sacrificial knife, and the crowns, were
  placed in a small basket, and carried to the sanctuary by a young maiden,
  whereupon the victim was conducted into the temple, frequently to the
  accompaniment of music. If a small animal, it was driven loose to the
  altar; if a large one, it was led by a  span
  class="pagenum">[194]long trailing rope, in
  order to indicate that it was not an unwilling sacrifice.

  When all were assembled, the priest, after walking in solemn state
  round the altar, besprinkled it with a mixture of meal and holy water,
  after which he also besprinkled the assembled worshippers, and exhorted
  them to join with him in prayer. The service being ended, the priest
  first tasted the libation, and after causing the congregation to do the
  like, poured the remainder between the horns of the victim, after which
  frankincense was strewn upon the altar, and a portion of the meal and
  water poured upon the animal, which was then killed. If by any chance the
  victim escaped the stroke, or became in any way restless, it was regarded
  as an evil omen; if, on the contrary, it expired without a struggle, it
  was considered auspicious.

  At the sacrifices to the aërial divinities music was added, whilst
  dances were performed round the altar, and sacred hymns sung. These hymns
  were generally composed in honour of the gods, and contained an account
  of their famous actions, their clemency and beneficence, and the gifts
  conferred by them on mankind. In conclusion, the gods were invoked for a
  continuance of their favour, and when the service was ended a feast was
  held.

ORACLES.

  The desire to penetrate the dark veil of futurity, and thereby to
  avert, if possible, threatened danger, has animated mankind in all ages
  of the world. Prophetic knowledge was sought by the Greeks at the mouth
  of oracles, whose predictions were interpreted to the people by priests,
  specially appointed for the purpose.

  The most famous of these institutions was the oracle of Apollo at
  Delphi, which was held in general repute all over the world. People
  flocked from far and near to consult this wonderful mouth-piece of the
  gods, one month in the year being specially set apart for the
  purpose.

[195]

  The priestess who delivered the oracles was called the Pythia, after
  the serpent Python, which was killed by Apollo. Having first bathed in
  the waters of the Castalian spring, she was conducted into the temple by
  the priests, and was seated on a sort of three-legged stool or table,
  called a tripod, which was placed over the mouth of a cave whence issued
  sulphurous vapours. Here she gradually became affected in a remarkable
  manner, and fell into an ecstatic condition, in which she uttered wild
  and extraordinary phrases, which were held to be the utterance of Apollo
  himself; these the priests interpreted to the people, but in most cases
  in so ambiguous a manner that the fulfilment of the prediction could not
  easily be disputed. During the ceremony, clouds of incense filled the
  temple, and hid the priestess from the view of the uninitiated, and at
  its conclusion she was reconducted, in a fainting condition, to her
  cell.

  The following is a striking instance of the ambiguity of oracular
  predictions:       Cr       sus, the rich king of Lydia, before going to
  war with Cyrus, king of Persia, consulted an oracle as to the probable
  success of the expedition. The reply he received was, that if he crossed
  a certain river he would destroy a great empire. Interpreting the
  response as being favourable to his design, Cr       sus crossed the
  river, and encountered the Persian king, by whom he was entirely
  defeated; and his own empire being destroyed, the prediction of the
  oracle was said to have been fulfilled.

SOOTHSAYERS (Augurs).

  In addition to the manifestation of the will of the gods by means of
  oracles, the Greeks also believed that certain men, called soothsayers,
  were gifted with the power of foretelling future events from dreams, from
  observing the flight of birds, the entrails of sacrificed animals, and
  even the direction of the flames and smoke from the altar,      c.  !--
  Page 196 -->[196]

AUGURS.

  The Roman soothsayers were called augurs, and played an important part
  in the history of the Romans, as no enterprise was ever undertaken
  without first consulting them with regard to its ultimate success.

FESTIVALS.

  Festivals were instituted as seasons of rest, rejoicing, and
  thanksgiving, and also as anniversaries to commemorate events of national
  importance. The most ancient festivals were those held after the
  ingathering of the harvest or vintage, and were celebrated with
  rejoicings and merry-makings, which lasted many days, during which time
  the first-fruits of the fields were offered to the gods, accompanied by
  prayers and thanksgiving.

  The festivals held in cities in honour of special divinities, or in
  commemoration of particular events, were conducted with an elaborate
  ceremonial. Gorgeous processions, games, chariot races,      c., were
  conspicuous features on these occasions, and dramatic performances,
  representing particular episodes in the lives of the gods and heroes,
  frequently took place.

  We subjoin a few of the most interesting of the Greek and Roman
  festivals.



GREEK FESTIVALS.

ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES.

  One of the most ancient and important among the festivals observed by
  the Greeks was that of the Eleusinian Mysteries, which was celebrated in
  honour of Demeter and Persephone. The name was derived from Eleusis, a
  town in Attica, where the Mysteries were first introduced by the goddess
  herself. They were divided into the  span
  class="pagenum">[197]Greater and Lesser
  Mysteries, and, according to the general account, were held every five
  years. The Greater, which were celebrated in honour of Demeter, and
  lasted nine days, were held in autumn; the Lesser, dedicated to
  Persephone (who at these festivals was affectionately called Cora, or the
  maiden), were held in spring.

  It is supposed that the secrets taught to the initiated by the
  priests       the expounders of the Mysteries       were moral meanings,
  elucidated from the myths concerning Demeter and Persephone; but the most
  important belief inculcated was the doctrine of the immortality of the
  soul. That the lessons taught were of the highest moral character is
  universally admitted. "The souls of those who participated in them were
  filled with the sweetest hopes both as to this and the future world;" and
  it was a common saying among the Athenians: "In the Mysteries no one is
  sad."

  The initiation into these solemn rites (which was originally the
  exclusive privilege of the Athenians) was accompanied with awe-inspiring
  ceremonies; and secrecy was so strictly enjoined that its violation was
  punished by death. At the conclusion of the initiation great rejoicings
  took place, chariot-races, wrestling matches,      c., were held, and
  solemn sacrifices offered.

  The initiation into the Lesser Mysteries served as a preparation for
  the Greater.

THESMOPHORIA.

  The Thesmophoria was another festival held in honour of Demeter, in
  her character as presiding over marriage and social institutions
  resulting from the spread of agriculture.

  This festival was celebrated exclusively by women.

DIONYSIA.

  A joyous spring festival was held in honour of Dionysus, in the month
  of March, and lasted several days.

[198]

  This festival, which was called the Greater Dionysia, was celebrated
  with particular splendour at Athens, when strangers flocked from all
  parts of the world to take part in the ceremonies. The city was gaily
  decorated, the houses were garlanded with ivy-leaves, crowds perambulated
  the streets, everything wore its holiday garb, and wine was freely
  indulged in.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0198-1.png"
      alt="Celebrating the Dionysia" title="Celebrating the Dionysia" />
  
  In the processions which took place during these festivities, the
  statue of Dionysus was carried, and men and women, crowned with ivy and
  bearing the thyrsus, were dressed in every description of grotesque
  costume, and played on drums, pipes, flutes, cymbals,      c. Some
  representing Silenus rode on asses, others wearing fawn-skins appeared as
  Pan or the Satyrs, and the whole multitude sang pæans in honour of the
  wine-god. Public shows, games, and sports took place, and the entire city
  was full of revelry.

  What lent additional interest to these festivals was the custom of
  introducing new comedies and tragedies to the public, representations of
  which were given, and prizes awarded to those which elicited the greatest
  admiration.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0198-2.png"
      alt="Celebrating the Dionysia" title="Celebrating the Dionysia" />
  
  The Lesser Dionysia were vintage festivals, celebrated in rural
  districts in the month of November, and were characterized by drinking,
  feasting, and joviality of all kinds.

  In connection with some of the festivals in honour of Dionysus were
  certain mystic observances, into which only women, called Menades or
  Bacchantes, were initiated. Clad in fawn-skins, they assembled by night
  on the mountain sides,  a
  name="page199">[199]some carrying blazing torches, others
  thyrsi, and all animated with religious enthusiasm and frenzy. They
  shouted, clapped their hands, danced wildly, and worked themselves up to
  such a pitch of excitement and fury that in their mad frenzy they tore in
  pieces the animal brought as a sacrifice to Dionysus.

  Under the name of Bacchanalia, these mystic rites were introduced into
  Rome, where men also were allowed to participate in them; but they were
  attended with such frightful excesses that the state authorities at
  length interfered and prohibited them.

PANATHENÆA.

  The Panathenæa was a famous festival celebrated in Athens in honour of
  Athene-Polias, the guardian of the state. There were two festivals of
  this name, the Lesser and the Greater Panathenæa. The former was held
  annually, and the latter, which lasted several days, was celebrated every
  fourth year.

  For the Greater Panathenæa a garment, embroidered with gold, called
  the Peplus, was specially woven by Athenian maidens, on which was
  represented the victory gained by Athene over the Giants. This garment
  was suspended to the mast of a ship which stood outside the city; and
  during the festival, which was characterized by a grand procession, the
  ship (with the Peplus on its mast) was impelled forward by means of
  invisible machinery, and formed the most conspicuous feature of the
  pageant. The whole population, bearing olive branches in their hands,
  took part in the procession; and amidst music and rejoicings this
  imposing pageant wended its way to the temple of Athene-Polias, where the
  Peplus was deposited on the statue of the goddess.

  At this festival, Homer's poems were declaimed aloud, and poets also
  introduced their own works to the public. Musical contests, foot and
  horse races, and wrestling matches were held, and dances were performed
  by boys in armour.

[200]

  Men who had deserved well of their country were presented at the
  festival with a crown of gold, and the name of the person so
  distinguished was announced publicly by a herald.

  The victors in the races and athletic games received, as a prize, a
  vase of oil, supposed to have been extracted from the fruit of the sacred
  olive-tree of Athene.

DAPHNEPHORIA.

  The Daphnephoria was celebrated at Thebes in honour of Apollo every
  ninth year.

  The distinguishing feature of this festival was a procession to the
  temple of Apollo, in which a young priest (the Daphnephorus) of noble
  descent, splendidly attired and wearing a crown of gold, was preceded by
  a youth, carrying an emblematical representation of the sun, moon, stars,
  and days of the year, and followed by beautiful maidens bearing laurel
  branches, and singing hymns in honour of the god.



ROMAN FESTIVALS.

SATURNALIA.

  The Saturnalia, a national festival held in December in honour of
  Saturn, was celebrated after the ingathering of the harvest, and lasted
  several days.

  It was a time of universal rejoicing, cessation from labour, and
  merry-making. School children had holidays, friends sent presents to each
  other, the law-courts were closed, and no business was transacted.

  Crowds of people from the surrounding country flocked to Rome for this
  festival attired in every variety of masquerade dress; practical jokes
  were given and received with the utmost good humour, shouts of exultation
  filled  a
  name="page201">[201]the air, all classes abandoned themselves
  to enjoyment, and unrestrained hilarity reigned supreme. Social
  distinctions were for a time suspended, or even reversed; and so heartily
  was the spirit of this festival entered into, that masters waited upon
  their slaves at banquets which they provided for them; the slaves being
  dressed upon these occasions in the garments of their masters.

  There appears little doubt that the modern Carnival is a survival of
  the ancient Saturnalia.

CEREALIA.

  This festival was celebrated in honour of Ceres. It was solemnized
  exclusively by women, who, dressed in white garments, wandered about with
  torches in their hands, to represent the search of the goddess for her
  daughter Proserpine.

  During this festival, games were celebrated in the Circus Maximus, to
  which none were admitted unless clothed in white.

VESTALIA.

  The Vestalia was a festival held in honour of Vesta on the 9th of
  June, and was celebrated exclusively by women, who walked barefooted in
  procession to the temple of the goddess.

  The priestesses of Vesta, called Vestales or Vestal Virgins, played a
  conspicuous part in these festivals. They were six in number, and were
  chosen       between the ages of six and ten       from the noblest
  families in Rome. Their term of office was thirty years. During the first
  ten years, they were initiated in their religious duties, during the
  second ten they performed them, and during the third they instructed
  novices. Their chief duty was to watch and feed the ever-burning flame on
  the altar of Vesta, the extinction of which was regarded as a national
  calamity of ominous import.

[202]

  Great honours and privileges were accorded to them; the best seats
  were reserved for their use at all public spectacles, and even the
  consuls and prætors made way for them to pass. If they met a criminal on
  his way to execution they had the power to pardon him, provided it could
  be proved that the meeting was accidental.

  The Vestales were vowed to chastity, a violation of which was visited
  by the frightful punishment of being buried alive.



[203]

PART II.       LEGENDS.

CADMUS.

  The following is the legendary account of the founding of
  Thebes:       

  After the abduction of his daughter Europa by Zeus, Agenor, king of
  Ph       nicia, unable to reconcile himself to her loss, despatched his
  son Cadmus in search of her, desiring him not to return without his
  sister.

  For many years Cadmus pursued his search through various countries,
  but without success. Not daring to return home without her, he consulted
  the oracle of Apollo at Delphi; and the reply was that he must desist
  from his task, and take upon himself a new duty, i.e. that of
  founding a city, the site of which would be indicated to him by a heifer
  which had never borne the yoke, and which would lie down on the spot
  whereon the city was to be built.

  Scarcely had Cadmus left the sacred fane, when he observed a heifer
  who bore no marks of servitude on her neck, walking slowly in front of
  him. He followed the animal for a considerable distance, until at length,
  on the site where Thebes afterwards stood, she looked towards heaven and,
  gently lowing, lay down in the long grass. Grateful for this mark of
  divine favour, Cadmus resolved to offer up the animal as a sacrifice, and
  accordingly sent his followers to fetch water for the libation from a
  neighbouring spring. This spring, which was sacred to Ares, was situated
  in a wood, and guarded by a fierce dragon, who, at the approach of the
  retainers of Cadmus, suddenly pounced upon them and killed them.

  After waiting some time for the return of his servants  !-- Page 204
  -->[204]Cadmus grew
  impatient, and hastily arming himself with his lance and spear, set out
  to seek them. On reaching the spot, the mangled remains of his
  unfortunate followers met his view, and near them he beheld the frightful
  monster, dripping with the blood of his victims. Seizing a huge rock, the
  hero hurled it with all his might upon the dragon; but protected by his
  tough black skin and steely scales as by a coat of mail, he remained
  unhurt. Cadmus now tried his lance, and with more success, for it pierced
  the side of the beast, who, furious with pain, sprang at his adversary,
  when Cadmus, leaping aside, succeeded in fixing the point of his spear
  within his jaws, which final stroke put an end to the encounter.

  While Cadmus stood surveying his vanquished foe Pallas-Athene appeared
  to him, and commanded him to sow the teeth of the dead dragon in the
  ground. He obeyed; and out of the furrows there arose a band of armed
  men, who at once commenced to fight with each other, until all except
  five were killed. These last surviving warriors made peace with each
  other, and it was with their assistance that Cadmus now built the famous
  city of Thebes. In later times the noblest Theban families proudly
  claimed their descent from these mighty earth-born warriors.

  Ares was furious with rage when he discovered that Cadmus had slain
  his dragon, and would have killed him had not Zeus interfered, and
  induced him to mitigate his punishment to that of servitude for the term
  of eight years. At the end of that time the god of war became reconciled
  to Cadmus, and, in token of his forgiveness, bestowed upon him the hand
  of his daughter Harmonia in marriage. Their nuptials were almost as
  celebrated as those of Peleus and Thetis. All the gods honoured them with
  their presence, and offered rich gifts and congratulations. Cadmus
  himself presented his lovely bride with a splendid necklace fashioned by
  Hephæstus, which, however, after the death of Harmonia, always proved
  fatal to its possessor.

  The children of Cadmus and Harmonia were one son,  !-- Page 205
  -->[205]Polydorus, and
  four daughters, Autonoe, Ino, Semele, and Agave.

  For many years the founder of Thebes reigned happily, but at length a
  conspiracy was formed against him, and he was deprived of his throne by
  his grandson Pentheus. Accompanied by his faithful wife Harmonia, he
  retired into Illyria, and after death they were both changed by Zeus into
  serpents, and transferred to Elysium.

PERSEUS.

  Perseus, one of the most renowned of the legendary heroes of
  antiquity, was the son of Zeus and Danaë, daughter of Acrisius, king of
  Argos.

  An oracle having foretold to Acrisius that a son of Danaë would be the
  cause of his death, he imprisoned her in a tower of brass in order to
  keep her secluded from the world. Zeus, however, descended through the
  roof of the tower in the form of a shower of gold, and the lovely Danaë
  became his bride.

  For four years Acrisius remained in ignorance of this union, but one
  evening as he chanced to pass by the brazen chamber, he heard the cry of
  a young child proceeding from within, which led to the discovery of his
  daughter's marriage with Zeus. Enraged at finding all his precautions
  unavailing, Acrisius commanded the mother and child to be placed in a
  chest and thrown into the sea.

  But it was not the will of Zeus that they should perish. He directed
  Poseidon to calm the troubled waters, and caused the chest to float
  safely to the island of Seriphus. Dictys, brother of Polydectes, king of
  the island, was fishing on the sea-shore when he saw the chest stranded
  on the beach; and pitying the helpless condition of its unhappy
  occupants, he conducted them to the palace of the king, where they were
  treated with the greatest kindness.

  Polydectes eventually became united to Danaë, and  !-- Page 206
  -->[206]bestowed upon
  Perseus an education befitting a hero. When he saw his stepson develop
  into a noble and manly youth he endeavoured to instil into his mind a
  desire to signalize himself by the achievement of some great and heroic
  deed, and after mature deliberation it was decided that the slaying of
  the Gorgon, Medusa, would bring him the greatest renown.

  For the successful accomplishment of his object it was necessary for
  him to be provided with a pair of winged sandals, a magic wallet, and the
  helmet of Aïdes, which rendered the wearer invisible, all of which were
  in the keeping of the Nymphs, the place of whose abode was known only to
  the Grææ. Perseus started on his expedition, and, guided by Hermes and
  Pallas-Athene, arrived, after a long journey, in the far-off region, on
  the borders of Oceanus, where dwelt the Grææ, daughters of Phorcys and
  Ceto. He at once applied to them for the necessary information, and on
  their refusing to grant it he deprived them of their single eye and
  tooth, which he only restored to them when they gave him full directions
  with regard to his route. He then proceeded to the abode of the Nymphs,
  from whom he obtained the objects indispensable for his purpose.

  Equipped with the magic helmet and wallet, and armed with a sickle,
  the gift of Hermes, he attached to his feet the winged sandals, and flew
  to the abode of the Gorgons, whom he found fast asleep. Now as Perseus
  had been warned by his celestial guides that whoever looked upon these
  weird sisters would be transformed into stone, he stood with averted face
  before the sleepers, and caught on his bright metal shield their triple
  image. Then, guided by Pallas-Athene, he cut off the head of the Medusa,
  which he placed in his wallet. No sooner had he done so than from the
  headless trunk there sprang forth the winged steed Pegasus, and Chrysaor,
  the father of the winged giant Geryon. He now hastened to elude the
  pursuit of the two surviving sisters, who, aroused from their slumbers,
  eagerly rushed to avenge the death of their sister.

[207]

  His invisible helmet and winged sandals here stood him in good stead;
  for the former concealed him from the view of the Gorgons, whilst the
  latter bore him swiftly over land and sea, far beyond the reach of
  pursuit. In passing over the burning plains of Libya the drops of blood
  from the head of the Medusa oozed through the wallet, and falling on the
  hot sands below produced a brood of many-coloured snakes, which spread
  all over the country.

  Perseus continued his flight until he reached the kingdom of Atlas, of
  whom he begged rest and shelter. But as this king possessed a valuable
  orchard, in which every tree bore golden fruit, he was fearful lest the
  slayer of the Medusa might destroy the dragon which guarded it, and then
  rob him of his treasures. He therefore refused to grant the hospitality
  which the hero demanded, whereupon Perseus, exasperated at the churlish
  repulse, produced from his wallet the head of the Medusa, and holding it
  towards the king, transformed him into a stony mountain. Beard and hair
  erected themselves into forests; shoulders, hands, and limbs became huge
  rocks, and the head grew up into a craggy peak which reached into the
  clouds.

  Perseus then resumed his travels. His winged sandals bore him over
  deserts and mountains, until he arrived at Æthiopia, the kingdom of King
  Cepheus. Here he found the country inundated with disastrous floods,
  towns and villages destroyed, and everywhere signs of desolation and
  ruin. On a projecting cliff close to the shore he beheld a lovely maiden
  chained to a rock. This was Andromeda, the king's daughter. Her mother
  Cassiopea, having boasted that her beauty surpassed that of the Nereides,
  the angry sea-nymphs appealed to Poseidon to avenge their wrongs,
  whereupon the sea-god devastated the country with a terrible inundation,
  which brought with it a huge monster who devoured all that came in his
  way.

  In their distress the unfortunate Æthiopians applied to the oracle of
  Jupiter-Ammon, in the Libyan desert,  span
  class="pagenum">[208]and obtained the
  response, that only by the sacrifice of the king's daughter to the
  monster could the country and people be saved.

  Cepheus, who was tenderly attached to his child, at first refused to
  listen to this dreadful proposal; but overcome at length by the prayers
  and solicitations of his unhappy subjects, the heart-broken father gave
  up his child for the welfare of his country. Andromeda was accordingly
  chained to a rock on the sea-shore to serve as a prey to the monster,
  whilst her unhappy parents bewailed her sad fate on the beach below.

  On being informed of the meaning of this tragic scene, Perseus
  proposed to Cepheus to slay the dragon, on condition that the lovely
  victim should become his bride. Overjoyed at the prospect of Andromeda's
  release, the king gladly acceded to the stipulation, and Perseus hastened
  to the rock, to breathe words of hope and comfort to the trembling
  maiden. Then assuming once more the helmet of Aïdes, he mounted into the
  air, and awaited the approach of the monster.

  Presently the sea opened, and the shark's head of the gigantic beast
  of the deep raised itself above the waves. Lashing his tail furiously
  from side to side, he leaped forward to seize his victim; but the gallant
  hero, watching his opportunity, suddenly darted down, and producing the
  head of the Medusa from his wallet, held it before the eyes of the
  dragon, whose hideous body became gradually transformed into a huge black
  rock, which remained for ever a silent witness of the miraculous
  deliverance of Andromeda. Perseus then led the maiden to her now happy
  parents, who, anxious to evince their gratitude to her deliverer ordered
  immediate preparations to be made for the nuptial feast. But the young
  hero was not to bear away his lovely bride uncontested; for in the midst
  of the banquet, Phineus, the king's brother, to whom Andromeda had
  previously been betrothed, returned to claim his bride. Followed by a
  band of armed warriors he forced his way into the hall, and a desperate
  encounter took place between the rivals,  span
  class="pagenum">[209]which might have
  terminated fatally for Perseus, had he not suddenly bethought himself of
  the Medusa's head. Calling to his friends to avert their faces, he drew
  it from his wallet, and held it before Phineus and his formidable
  body-guard, whereupon they all stiffened into stone.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0209-1.png"
      alt="Pallas-Athene with her shield" title="Pallas-Athene with her shield" />
  
  Perseus now took leave of the Æthiopian king, and, accompanied by his
  beautiful bride, returned to Seriphus, where a joyful meeting took place
  between Danaë and her son. He then sent a messenger to his grandfather,
  informing him that he intended returning to Argos; but Acrisius, fearing
  the fulfilment of the oracular prediction, fled for protection to his
  friend Teutemias, king of Larissa. Anxious to induce the aged monarch to
  return to Argos, Perseus followed him thither. But here a strange
  fatality occurred. Whilst taking part in some funereal games, celebrated
  in honour of the king's father, Perseus, by an unfortunate throw of the
  discus, accidentally struck his grandfather, and thereby was the innocent
  cause of his death.

  After celebrating the funereal rites of Acrisius with due solemnity,
  Perseus returned to Argos; but feeling loath to occupy the throne of one
  whose death he had caused, he exchanged kingdoms with Megapenthes, king
  of Tiryns, and in course of time founded the cities of Mycenæ and
  Midea.

  The head of the Medusa he presented to his divine patroness,
  Pallas-Athene, who placed it in the centre of her shield.

  Many great heroes were descended from Perseus and Andromeda, foremost
  among whom was Heracles, whose mother, Alcmene, was their
  granddaughter.

  Heroic honours were paid to Perseus, not only  span
  class="pagenum">[210]throughout Argos, but
  also at Athens and in the island of Seriphus.

ION.

  Ion was the son of Crëusa (the beauteous daughter of Erechtheus, king
  of Athens) and the sun-god Ph       bus-Apollo, to whom she was united
  without the knowledge of her father.

  Fearing the anger of Erechtheus, Crëusa placed her new-born babe in a
  little wicker basket, and hanging some golden charms round his neck,
  invoked for him the protection of the gods, and concealed him in a lonely
  cave. Apollo, pitying his deserted child, sent Hermes to convey him to
  Delphi, where he deposited his charge on the steps of the temple. Next
  morning the Delphic priestess discovered the infant, and was so charmed
  by his engaging appearance that she adopted him as her own son. The young
  child was carefully tended and reared by his kind foster-mother, and was
  brought up in the service of the temple, where he was intrusted with some
  of the minor duties of the holy edifice.

  And now to return to Crëusa. During a war with the Eub       ans, in
  which the latter were signally defeated, Xuthus, son of Æolus, greatly
  distinguished himself on the side of the Athenians, and as a reward for
  his valuable services, the hand of Crëusa, the king's daughter, was
  bestowed upon him in marriage. Their union, however, was not blest with
  children, and as this was a source of great grief to both of them, they
  repaired to Delphi in order to consult the oracle. The response was, that
  Xuthus should regard the first person who met him on leaving the
  sanctuary as his son. Now it happened that Ion, the young guardian of the
  temple, was the first to greet his view, and when Xuthus beheld the
  beautiful youth, he gladly welcomed him as his son, declaring that the
  gods had sent him to be a blessing and comfort to his old age. Crëusa,
  however, who concluded that the youth was the offspring of a secret
  marriage on the part of her husband, was filled with suspicion and
  jealousy;  a
  name="page211">[211]when an old servant, observing her grief,
  begged her to be comforted, assuring her that the cause of her distress
  should be speedily removed.

  When, upon the occasion of the public adoption of his son, Xuthus gave
  a grand banquet, the old servant of Crëusa contrived to mix a strong
  poison in the wine of the unsuspecting Ion. But the youth       according
  to the pious custom of the ancients, of offering a libation to the gods
  before partaking of any repast       poured upon the ground a portion of
  the wine before putting it to his lips, when suddenly, as if by a
  miracle, a dove flew into the banquet-hall, and sipped of the wine of the
  libation; whereupon the poor little creature began to quiver in every
  limb, and in a few moments expired.

  Ion's suspicions at once fell upon the obsequious servant of Crëusa,
  who with such officious attention had filled his cup. He violently seized
  the old man, and accused him of his murderous intentions. Unprepared for
  this sudden attack he admitted his guilt, but pointed to the wife of
  Xuthus as the instigator of the crime. Ion was about to avenge himself
  upon Crëusa, when, by means of the divine intervention of Apollo, his
  foster-mother, the Delphic priestess appeared on the scene, and explained
  the true relationship which existed between Crëusa and Ion. In order to
  set all doubts at rest, she produced the charms which she had found round
  the neck of the infant, and also the wicker basket in which he had been
  conveyed to Delphi.

  Mother and son now became reconciled to each other, and Crëusa
  revealed to Ion the secret of his divine origin. The priestess of Delphi
  foretold that he would become the father of a great nation, called after
  him the Ionians, and also that Xuthus and Crëusa would have a son called
  Dorus, who would be the progenitor of the Dorian people, both of which
  predictions were in due time verified.

DÆDALUS and ICARUS.

  Dædalus, a descendant of Erechtheus, was an Athenian architect,
  sculptor, and mechanician. He was the first  span
  class="pagenum">[212]to introduce the art of
  sculpture in its higher development, for before his time statues were
  merely rude representations, having the limbs altogether undefined.

  But great as was his genius, still greater was his vanity, and he
  could brook no rival. Now his nephew and pupil, Talus, exhibited great
  talent, having invented both the saw and the compass, and Dædalus,
  fearing lest he might overshadow his own fame, secretly killed him by
  throwing him down from the citadel of Pallas-Athene. The murder being
  discovered, Dædalus was summoned before the court of the Areopagus and
  condemned to death; but he made his escape to the island of Crete, where
  he was received by king Minos in a manner worthy of his great
  reputation.

  Dædalus constructed for the king the world-renowned labyrinth, which
  was an immense building, full of intricate passages, intersecting each
  other in such a manner, that even Dædalus himself is said, upon one
  occasion, to have nearly lost his way in it; and it was in this building
  the king placed the Minotaur, a monster with the head and shoulders of a
  bull and the body of a man.

  In the course of time the great artist became weary of his long exile,
  more especially as the king, under the guise of friendship, kept him
  almost a prisoner. He therefore resolved to make his escape, and for this
  purpose ingeniously contrived wings for himself and his young son Icarus,
  whom he diligently trained how to use them. Having awaited a favourable
  opportunity, father and son commenced their flight, and were well on
  their way when Icarus, pleased with the novel sensation, forgot
  altogether his father's oft-repeated injunction not to approach too near
  the sun. The consequence was that the wax, by means of which his wings
  were attached, melted, and he fell into the sea and was drowned. The body
  of the unfortunate Icarus was washed up by the tide, and was buried by
  the bereaved father on an island which he called after his son,
  Icaria.

  After this sad event, Dædalus winged his flight to the island of
  Sicily, where he met with a kind welcome from  span
  class="pagenum">[213]king Cocalus, for whom
  he constructed several important public works. But no sooner did Minos
  receive the intelligence that his great architect had found an asylum
  with Cocalus than he sailed over to Sicily with a large army, and sent
  messengers to the Sicilian king demanding the surrender of his guest.
  Cocalus feigned compliance and invited Minos to his palace, where he was
  treacherously put to death in a warm bath. The body of their king was
  brought to Agrigent by the Cretans, where it was buried with great pomp,
  and over his tomb a temple to Aphrodite was erected.

  Dædalus passed the remainder of his life tranquilly in the island of
  Sicily, where he occupied himself in the construction of various
  beautiful works of art.

THE ARGONAUTS.

  Aeson, king of Iolcus, was forced to fly from his dominions, which had
  been usurped by his younger brother, Pelias, and with difficulty
  succeeded in saving the life of his young son, Jason, who was at that
  time only ten years of age. He intrusted him to the care of the Centaur
  Chiron, by whom he was carefully trained in company with other noble
  youths, who, like himself, afterwards signalized themselves by their
  bravery and heroic exploits. For ten years Jason remained in the cave of
  the Centaur, by whom he was instructed in all useful and warlike arts.
  But as he approached manhood he became filled with an unconquerable
  desire to regain his paternal inheritance. He therefore took leave of his
  kind friend and preceptor, and set out for Iolcus to demand from his
  uncle Pelias the kingdom which he had so unjustly usurped.

  In the course of his journey he came to a broad and foaming river, on
  the banks of which he perceived an old woman, who implored him to help
  her across. At first he hesitated, knowing that even alone he would find
  some difficulty in stemming the fierce torrent; but,  !-- Page 214
  -->[214]pitying her
  forlorn condition, he raised her in his arms, and succeeded, with a great
  effort, in reaching the opposite shore. But as soon as her feet had
  touched the earth she became transformed into a beautiful woman, who,
  looking kindly at the bewildered youth, informed him that she was the
  goddess Hera, and that she would henceforth guide and protect him
  throughout his career. She then disappeared, and, full of hope and
  courage at this divine manifestation, Jason pursued his journey. He now
  perceived that in crossing the river he had lost one of his sandals, but
  as it could not be recovered he was obliged to proceed without it.

  On his arrival at Iolcus he found his uncle in the market-place,
  offering up a public sacrifice to Poseidon. When the king had concluded
  his offering, his eye fell upon the distinguished stranger, whose manly
  beauty and heroic bearing had already attracted the attention of his
  people. Observing that one foot was unshod, he was reminded of an
  oracular prediction which foretold to him the loss of his kingdom by a
  man wearing only one sandal. He, however, disguised his fears, conversed
  kindly with the youth, and drew from him his name and errand. Then
  pretending to be highly pleased with his nephew, Pelias entertained him
  sumptuously for five days, during which time all was festivity and
  rejoicing. On the sixth, Jason appeared before his uncle, and with manly
  firmness demanded from him the throne and kingdom which were his by
  right. Pelias, dissembling his true feelings, smilingly consented to
  grant his request, provided that, in return, Jason would undertake an
  expedition for him, which his advanced age prevented him from
  accomplishing himself. He informed his nephew that the shade of Phryxus
  had appeared to him in his dreams, and entreated him to bring back from
  Colchis his mortal remains and the Golden Fleece; and added that if Jason
  succeeded in obtaining for him these sacred relics, throne, kingdom, and
  sceptre should be his.

[215]

STORY OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE.

  Athamas, king of B       otia, had married Nephele, a cloud-nymph, and
  their children were Helle and Phryxus. The restless and wandering nature
  of Nephele, however, soon wearied her husband, who, being a mortal, had
  little sympathy with his ethereal consort; so he divorced her, and
  married the beautiful but wicked Ino (sister of Semele), who hated her
  step-children, and even planned their destruction. But the watchful
  Nephele contrived to circumvent her cruel designs, and succeeded in
  getting the children out of the palace. She then placed them both on the
  back of a winged ram, with a fleece of pure gold, which had been given to
  her by Hermes; and on this wonderful animal brother and sister rode
  through the air over land and sea; but on the way Helle, becoming seized
  with giddiness, fell into the sea (called after her the Hellespont) and
  was drowned.

  Phryxus arrived safely at Colchis, where he was hospitably received by
  king Aëtes, who gave him one of his daughters in marriage. In gratitude
  to Zeus for the protection accorded him during his flight, Phryxus
  sacrificed to him the golden ram, whilst the fleece he presented to
  Aëtes, who nailed it up in the Grove of Ares, and dedicated it to the god
  of War. An oracle having declared that the life of Aëtes depended on the
  safe-keeping of the fleece, he carefully guarded the entrance to the
  grove by placing before it an immense dragon, which never slept.

  Building and Launch of the Argo.       We will now return to
  Jason, who eagerly undertook the perilous expedition proposed to him by
  his uncle, who, well aware of the dangers attending such an enterprise,
  hoped by this means to rid himself for ever of the unwelcome
  intruder.

  Jason accordingly began to arrange his plans without delay, and
  invited the young heroes whose friendship he  span
  class="pagenum">[216]had formed whilst under
  the care of Chiron, to join him in the perilous expedition. None refused
  the invitation, all feeling honoured at being allowed the privilege of
  taking part in so noble and heroic an undertaking.

  Jason now applied to Argos, one of the cleverest ship-builders of his
  time, who, under the guidance of Pallas-Athene, built for him a splendid
  fifty-oared galley, which was called the Argo, after the builder. In the
  upper deck of the vessel the goddess had imbedded a board from the
  speaking oak of the oracle of Zeus at Dodona, which ever retained its
  powers of prophecy. The exterior of the ship was ornamented with
  magnificent carvings, and the whole vessel was so strongly built that it
  defied the power of the winds and waves, and was, nevertheless, so light
  that the heroes, when necessary, were able to carry it on their
  shoulders. When the vessel was completed, the Argonauts (so called after
  their ship) assembled, and their places were distributed by lot.

  Jason was appointed commander-in-chief of the expedition, Tiphys acted
  as steersman, Lynceus as pilot. In the bow of the vessel sat the renowned
  hero Heracles; in the stern, Peleus (father of Achilles) and Telamon (the
  father of Ajax the Great). In the inner space were Castor and Pollux,
  Neleus (the father of Nestor), Admetus (the husband of Alcestes),
  Meleager (the slayer of the Calydonian boar), Orpheus (the renowned
  singer), Menoctius (the father of Patroclus), Theseus (afterwards king of
  Athens) and his friend Pirithöus (the son of Ixion), Hylas (the adopted
  son of Heracles), Euphemus (the son of Poseidon), Oileus (father of Ajax
  the Lesser), Zetes and Calais (the winged sons of Boreas), Idmon the Seer
  (the son of Apollo), Mopsus (the Thessalian prophet),      c.      c.

  Before their departure Jason offered a solemn sacrifice to Poseidon
  and all the other sea-deities; he also invoked the protection of Zeus and
  the Fates, and then, Mopsus having taken the auguries, and found them
  auspicious, the heroes stepped on board. And now a favourable breeze
  having sprung up, they take their allotted places,  span
  class="pagenum">[217]the anchor is weighed,
  and the ship glides like a bird out of the harbour into the waters of the
  great sea.

  Arrival at Lemnos.       The Argo, with her brave crew of fifty
  heroes, was soon out of sight, and the sea-breeze only wafted to the
  shore a faint echo of the sweet strains of Orpheus.

  For a time all went smoothly, but the vessel was soon driven, by
  stress of weather, to take refuge in a harbour in the island of Lemnos.
  This island was inhabited by women only, who, the year before, in a fit
  of mad jealousy, had killed all the male population of the island, with
  the exception of the father of their queen, Hypsipyle. As the protection
  of their island now devolved upon themselves they were always on the
  look-out for danger. When, therefore, they sighted the Argo from afar
  they armed themselves and rushed to the shore, determined to repel any
  invasion of their territory.

  On arriving in port the Argonauts, astonished at beholding an armed
  crowd of women, despatched a herald in one of their boats, bearing the
  staff of peace and friendship. Hypsipyle, the queen, proposed that food
  and presents should be sent to the strangers, in order to prevent their
  landing; but her old nurse, who stood beside her, suggested that this
  would be a good opportunity to provide themselves with noble husbands,
  who would act as their defenders, and thus put an end to their constant
  fears. Hypsipyle listened attentively to the advice of her nurse, and
  after some consultation, decided to invite the strangers into the city.
  Robed in his purple mantle, the gift of Pallas-Athene, Jason, accompanied
  by some of his companions, stepped on shore, where he was met by a
  deputation consisting of the most beautiful of the Lemnian women, and, as
  commander of the expedition, was invited into the palace of the
  queen.

  When he appeared before Hypsipyle, she was so struck with his godlike
  and heroic presence that she presented him with her father's sceptre, and
  invited him to seat himself on the throne beside her. Jason thereupon
   a
  name="page218">[218]took up his residence in the royal castle,
  whilst his companions scattered themselves through the town, spending
  their time in feasting and pleasure. Heracles, with a few chosen
  comrades, alone remained on board.

  From day to day their departure was delayed, and the Argonauts, in
  their new life of dissipation, had almost forgotten the object of the
  expedition, when Heracles suddenly appeared amongst them, and at last
  recalled them to a sense of their duty.

  Giants and Doliones.       The Argonauts now pursued their
  voyage, till contrary winds drove them towards an island, inhabited by
  the Doliones, whose king Cyzicus received them with great kindness and
  hospitality. The Doliones were descendants of Poseidon, who protected
  them against the frequent attacks of their fierce and formidable
  neighbours, the earth-born Giants       monsters with six arms.

  Whilst his companions were attending a banquet given by king Cyzicus,
  Heracles, who, as usual, had remained behind to guard the ship, observed
  that these Giants were busy blocking up the harbour with huge rocks. He
  at once realized the danger, and, attacking them with his arrows,
  succeeded in considerably thinning their numbers; then, assisted by the
  heroes, who at length came to his aid, he effectually destroyed the
  remainder.

  The Argo now steered out of the harbour and set sail; but in
  consequence of a severe storm which arose at night, was driven back once
  more to the shores of the kindly Doliones. Unfortunately, however, owing
  to the darkness of the night, the inhabitants failed to recognize their
  former guests, and, mistaking them for enemies, commenced to attack them.
  Those who had so recently parted as friends were now engaged in mortal
  combat, and in the battle which ensued, Jason himself pierced to the
  heart his friend king Cyzicus; whereupon the Doliones, being deprived of
  their leader, fled to their city and closed the gates. When morning
  dawned, and both sides perceived their error, they were filled with  !--
  Page 219 -->[219]the
  deepest sorrow and remorse; and for three days the heroes remained with
  the Doliones, celebrating the funereal rites of the slain, with every
  demonstration of mourning and solemnity.

  Heracles left behind.       The Argonauts once more set sail,
  and after a stormy voyage arrived at Mysia, where they were hospitably
  received by the inhabitants, who spread before them plentiful banquets
  and sumptuously regaled them.

  While his friends were feasting, Heracles, who had declined to join
  them, went into the forest to seek a fir-tree which he required for an
  oar, and was missed by his adopted son Hylas, who set out to seek him.
  When the youth arrived at a spring, in the most secluded part of the
  forest, the nymph of the fountain was so struck by his beauty that she
  drew him down beneath the waters, and he was seen no more. Polyphemus,
  one of the heroes, who happened to be also in the forest, heard his cry
  for help, and on meeting Heracles informed him of the circumstance. They
  at once set out in search of the missing youth, no traces of whom were to
  be found, and whilst they were engaged looking for him, the Argo set sail
  and left them behind.

  The ship had proceeded some distance before the absence of Heracles
  was observed. Some of the heroes were in favour of returning for him,
  others wished to proceed on their journey, when, in the midst of the
  dispute, the sea-god Glaucus arose from the waves, and informed them that
  it was the will of Zeus that Heracles, having another mission to perform,
  should remain behind. The Argonauts continued their voyage without their
  companions; Heracles returned to Argos, whilst Polyphemus remained with
  the Mysians, where he founded a city and became its king.

  Contest with Amycus.       Next morning the Argo touched at the
  country of the Bebrycians, whose king Amycus was a famous pugilist, and
  permitted no strangers to leave his shores without matching their  !--
  Page 220 --> a
  name="page220">[220]strength with his. When the heroes,
  therefore, demanded permission to land, they were informed that they
  could only do so provided that one of their number should engage in a
  boxing-match with the king. Pollux, who was the best pugilist in Greece,
  was selected as their champion, and a contest took place, which, after a
  tremendous struggle, proved fatal to Amycus, who had hitherto been
  victorious in all similar encounters.

  Phineus and the Harpies.       They now proceeded towards
  Bithynia, where reigned the blind old prophet-king Phineus, son of
  Agenor. Phineus had been punished by the gods with premature old age and
  blindness for having abused the gift of prophecy. He was also tormented
  by the Harpies, who swooped down upon his food, which they either
  devoured or so defiled as to render it unfit to be eaten. This poor old
  man, trembling with the weakness of age, and faint with hunger, appeared
  before the Argonauts, and implored their assistance against his fiendish
  tormentors, whereupon Zetes and Calais, the winged sons of Boreas,
  recognizing in him the husband of their sister Cleopatra, affectionately
  embraced him, and promised to rescue him from his painful position.

  The heroes prepared a banquet on the sea-shore, to which they invited
  Phineus; but no sooner had he taken his place, than the Harpies appeared
  and devoured all the viands. Zetes and Calais now rose up into the air,
  drove the Harpies away, and were pursuing them with drawn swords, when
  Iris, the swift-footed messenger of the gods, appeared, and desired them
  to desist from their work of vengeance, promising that Phineus should be
  no longer molested.

  Freed at length from his tormentors the old man sat down and enjoyed a
  plentiful repast with his kind friends the Argonauts, who now informed
  him of the object of their voyage. In gratitude for his deliverance
  Phineus gave them much useful information concerning their journey, and
  not only warned them of the manifold  span
  class="pagenum">[221]dangers awaiting them,
  but also instructed them how they might be overcome.

  Passage of the Symplegades.       After a fortnight's sojourn
  in Bithynia the Argonauts once more set sail, but had not proceeded far
  on their course, when they heard a fearful and tremendous crash. This was
  caused by the meeting of two great rocky islands, called the Symplegades,
  which floated about in the sea, and constantly met and separated.

  Before leaving Bithynia, the blind old seer, Phineus, had informed
  them that they would be compelled to pass between these terrible rocks,
  and he instructed them how to do so with safety. As they now approached
  the scene of danger they remembered his advice, and acted upon it.
  Typhus, the steersman, stood at the helm, whilst Euphemus held in his
  hand a dove ready to be let loose; for Phineus had told them that if the
  dove ventured to fly through, they might safely follow. Euphemus now
  despatched the bird, which passed swiftly through the islands, yet not
  without losing some of the feathers of her tail, so speedily did they
  reunite. Seizing the moment when the rocks once more separated, the
  Argonauts worked at their oars with all their might, and achieved the
  perilous passage in safety.

  After the miraculous passage of the Argo, the Symplegades became
  permanently united, and attached to the bottom of the sea.

  The Stymphalides.       The Argo pursued her course along the
  southern coast of the Pontus, and arrived at the island of Aretias, which
  was inhabited by birds, who, as they flew through the air, discharged
  from their wings feathers sharp as arrows.

  As the ship was gliding along, Oileus was wounded by one of these
  birds, whereupon the Argonauts held a council, and by the advice of
  Amphidamas, an experienced hero, all put on their helmets, and held up
  their glittering shields, uttering, at the same time, such fearful cries
  that  a
  name="page222">[222]the birds flew away in terror, and the
  Argonauts were enabled to land with safety on the island.

  Here they found four shipwrecked youths, who proved to be the sons of
  Phryxus, and were greeted by Jason as his cousins. On ascertaining the
  object of the expedition they volunteered to accompany the Argo, and to
  show the heroes the way to Colchis. They also informed them that the
  Golden Fleece was guarded by a fearful dragon, that king Aëtes was
  extremely cruel, and, as the son of Apollo, was possessed of superhuman
  strength.

  Arrival at Colchis.       Taking with them the four new-comers
  they journeyed on, and soon came in sight of the snow-capped peaks of the
  Caucasus, when, towards evening, the loud flapping of wings was heard
  overhead. It was the giant eagle of Prometheus on his way to torture the
  noble and long-suffering Titan, whose fearful groans soon afterwards fell
  upon their ears. That night they reached their journey's end, and
  anchored in the smooth waters of the river Phases. On the left bank of
  this river they beheld Ceuta, the capital of Colchis; and on their right
  a wide field, and the sacred grove of Ares, where the Golden Fleece,
  suspended from a magnificent oak-tree, was glittering in the sun. Jason
  now filled a golden cup with wine, and offered a libation to
  mother-earth, the gods of the country, and the shades of those of the
  heroes who had died on the voyage.

  Next morning a council was held, in which it was decided, that before
  resorting to forcible measures kind and conciliatory overtures should
  first be made to king Aëtes in order to induce him to resign the Golden
  Fleece. It was arranged that Jason, with a few chosen companions, should
  proceed to the royal castle, leaving the remainder of the crew to guard
  the Argo. Accompanied, therefore, by Telamon and Augeas, and the four
  sons of Phryxus, he set out for the palace.

  When they arrived in sight of the castle they were struck by the
  vastness and massiveness of the building, at the entrance to which
  sparkling fountains played in  a
  name="page223">[223]the midst of luxuriant and park-like
  gardens. Here the king's daughters, Chalciope and Medea, who were walking
  in the grounds of the palace, met them. The former, to her great joy,
  recognized in the youths who accompanied the hero her own long-lost sons,
  whom she had mourned as dead, whilst the young and lovely Medea was
  struck with the noble and manly form of Jason.

  The news of the return of the sons of Phryxus soon spread through the
  palace, and brought Aëtes himself to the scene, whereupon the strangers
  were presented to him, and were invited to a banquet which the king
  ordered to be prepared in their honour. All the most beautiful ladies of
  the court were present at this entertainment; but in the eyes of Jason
  none could compare with the king's daughter, the young and lovely
  Medea.

  When the banquet was ended, Jason related to the king his various
  adventures, and also the object of his expedition, with the circumstances
  which had led to his undertaking it. Aëtes listened, in silent
  indignation, to this recital, and then burst out into a torrent of
  invectives against the Argonauts and his grand-children, declaring that
  the Fleece was his rightful property, and that on no consideration would
  he consent to relinquish it. Jason, however, with mild and persuasive
  words, contrived so far to conciliate him, that he was induced to promise
  that if the heroes could succeed in demonstrating their divine origin by
  the performance of some task requiring superhuman power, the Fleece
  should be theirs.

  The task proposed by Aëtes to Jason was that he should yoke the two
  brazen-footed, fire-breathing oxen of the king (which had been made for
  him by Hephæstus) to his ponderous iron plough. Having done this he must
  till with them the stony field of Ares, and then sow in the furrows the
  poisonous teeth of a dragon, from which armed men would arise. These he
  must destroy to a man, or he himself would perish at their hands.

  When Jason heard what was expected of him, his heart for a moment sank
  within him; but he determined, nevertheless, not to flinch from his task,
  but to trust to the  a
  name="page224">[224]assistance of the gods, and to his own
  courage and energy.

  Jason ploughs the Field of Ares.       Accompanied by his two
  friends, Telamon and Augeas, and also by Argus, the son of Chalciope,
  Jason returned to the vessel for the purpose of holding a consultation as
  to the best means of accomplishing these perilous feats.

  Argus explained to Jason all the difficulties of the superhuman task
  which lay before him, and pronounced it as his opinion that the only
  means by which success was possible was to enlist the assistance of the
  Princess Medea, who was a priestess of Hecate, and a great enchantress.
  His suggestion meeting with approval, he returned to the palace, and by
  the aid of his mother an interview was arranged between Jason and Medea,
  which took place, at an early hour next morning, in the temple of
  Hecate.

  A confession of mutual attachment took place, and Medea, trembling for
  her lover's safety, presented him with a magic salve, which possessed the
  property of rendering any person anointed with it invulnerable for the
  space of one day against fire and steel, and invincible against any
  adversary however powerful. With this salve she instructed him to anoint
  his spear and shield on the day of his great undertaking. She further
  added that when, after having ploughed the field and sown the teeth,
  armed men should arise from the furrows, he must on no account lose
  heart, but remember to throw among them a huge rock, over the possession
  of which they would fight among themselves, and their attention being
  thus diverted he would find it an easy task to destroy them. Overwhelmed
  with gratitude, Jason thanked her, in the most earnest manner, for her
  wise counsel and timely aid; at the same time he offered her his hand,
  and promised her he would not return to Greece without taking her with
  him as his wife.

  Next morning Aëtes, in all the pomp of state, surrounded by his family
  and the members of his court,  a
  name="page225">[225]repaired to a spot whence a full view of
  the approaching spectacle could be obtained. Soon Jason appeared in the
  field of Ares, looking as noble and majestic as the god of war himself.
  In a distant part of the field the brazen yokes and the massive plough
  met his view, but as yet the dread animals themselves were nowhere to be
  seen. He was about to go in quest of them, when they suddenly rushed out
  from a subterranean cave, breathing flames of fire, and enveloped in a
  thick smoke.

  The friends of Jason trembled; but the undaunted hero, relying on the
  magic powers with which he was imbued by Medea, seized the oxen, one
  after the other, by the horns, and forced them to the yoke. Near the
  plough was a helmet full of dragon's teeth, which he sowed as he ploughed
  the field, whilst with sharp pricks from his lance he compelled the
  monstrous creatures to draw the plough over the stony ground, which was
  thus speedily tilled.

  While Jason was engaged sowing the dragon's teeth in the deep furrows
  of the field, he kept a cautious look-out lest the germinating giant
  brood might grow too quickly for him, and as soon as the four acres of
  land had been tilled he unyoked the oxen, and succeeded in frightening
  them so effectually with his weapons, that they rushed back in terror to
  their subterranean stables. Meanwhile armed men had sprung up out of the
  furrows, and the whole field now bristled with lances; but Jason,
  remembering the instructions of Medea, seized an immense rock and hurled
  it into the midst of these earth-born warriors, who immediately began to
  attack each other. Jason then rushed furiously upon them, and after a
  terrible struggle not one of the giants remained alive.

  Furious at seeing his murderous schemes thus defeated, Aëtes not only
  perfidiously refused to give Jason the Fleece which he had so bravely
  earned, but, in his anger, determined to destroy all the Argonauts, and
  to burn their vessel.

  Jason secures the Golden Fleece.       Becoming aware of the
  treacherous designs of her father, Medea at  span
  class="pagenum">[226]once took measures to
  baffle them. In the darkness of night she went on board the Argo, and
  warned the heroes of their approaching danger. She then advised Jason to
  accompany her without loss of time to the sacred grove, in order to
  possess himself of the long-coveted treasure. They set out together, and
  Medea, followed by Jason, led the way, and advanced boldly into the
  grove. The tall oak-tree was soon discovered, from the topmost boughs of
  which hung the beautiful Golden Fleece. At the foot of this tree, keeping
  his ever-wakeful watch, lay the dreadful, sleepless dragon, who at sight
  of them bounded forward, opening his huge jaws.

  Medea now called into play her magic powers, and quietly approaching
  the monster, threw over him a few drops of a potion, which soon took
  effect, and sent him into a deep sleep; whereupon Jason, seizing the
  opportunity, climbed the tree and secured the Fleece. Their perilous task
  being now accomplished, Jason and Medea quitted the grove, and hastened
  on board the Argo, which immediately put to sea.

  Murder of Absyrtus.       Meanwhile Aëtes, having discovered
  the loss of his daughter and the Golden Fleece, despatched a large fleet,
  under the command of his son Absyrtus, in pursuit of the fugitives. After
  some days' sail they arrived at an island at the mouth of the river
  Ister, where they found the Argo at anchor, and surrounded her with their
  numerous ships. They then despatched a herald on board of her, demanding
  the surrender of Medea and the Fleece.

  Medea now consulted Jason, and, with his consent, carried out the
  following stratagem. She sent a message to her brother Absyrtus, to the
  effect that she had been carried off against her will, and promised that
  if he would meet her, in the darkness of night, in the temple of Artemis,
  she would assist him in regaining possession of the Golden Fleece.
  Relying on the good faith of his sister, Absyrtus fell into the snare,
  and duly appeared at the appointed trysting-place; and whilst Medea kept
  her  a
  name="page227">[227]brother engaged in conversation, Jason
  rushed forward and slew him. Then, according to a preconcerted signal, he
  held aloft a lighted torch, whereupon the Argonauts attacked the
  Colchians, put them to flight, and entirely defeated them.

  The Argonauts now returned to their ship, when the prophetic board
  from the Dodonean oak thus addressed them: "The cruel murder of Absyrtus
  was witnessed by the Erinyes, and you will not escape the wrath of Zeus
  until the goddess Circe has purified you from your crime. Let Castor and
  Pollux pray to the gods that you may be enabled to find the abode of the
  sorceress." In obedience to the voice, the twin-brothers invoked divine
  assistance, and the heroes set out in search of the isle of Circe.

  They arrive at the Island of Circe.       The good ship Argo
  sped on her way, and, after passing safely through the foaming waters of
  the river Eridanus, at length arrived in the harbour of the island of
  Circe, where she cast anchor.

  Commanding his companions to remain on board, Jason landed with Medea,
  and conducted her to the palace of the sorceress. The goddess of charms
  and magic arts received them kindly, and invited them to be seated; but
  instead of doing so they assumed a supplicating attitude, and humbly
  besought her protection. They then informed her of the dreadful crime
  which they had committed, and implored her to purify them from it. This
  Circe promised to do. She forthwith commanded her attendant Naiads to
  kindle the fire on the altar, and to prepare everything necessary for the
  performance of the mystic rites, after which a dog was sacrificed, and
  the sacred cakes were burned. Having thus duly purified the criminals,
  she severely reprimanded them for the horrible murder of which they had
  been guilty; whereupon Medea, with veiled head, and weeping bitterly, was
  reconducted by Jason to the Argo.

  Further Adventures of the Argonauts.       Having left the
  island of Circe they were wafted by gentle  span
  class="pagenum">[228]zephyrs towards the
  abode of the Sirens, whose enticing strains soon fell upon their ears.
  The Argonauts, powerfully affected by the melody, were making ready to
  land, when Orpheus perceived the danger, and, to the accompaniment of his
  magic lyre, commenced one of his enchanting songs, which so completely
  absorbed his listeners that they passed the island in safety; but not
  before Butes, one of their number, lured by the seductive music of the
  Sirens, had sprung from the vessel into the waves below. Aphrodite,
  however, in pity for his youth, landed him gently on the island of
  Libibaon before the Sirens could reach him, and there he remained for
  many years.

  And now the Argonauts approached new dangers, for on one side of them
  seethed and foamed the whirlpool of Charybdis, whilst on the other
  towered the mighty rock whence the monster Scylla swooped down upon
  unfortunate mariners; but here the goddess Hera came to their assistance,
  and sent to them the sea-nymph Thetis, who guided them safely through
  these dangerous straits.

  The Argo next arrived at the island of the Phæaces, where they were
  hospitably entertained by King Alcinous and his queen Arete. But the
  banquet prepared for them by their kind host was unexpectedly interrupted
  by the appearance of a large army of Colchians, sent by Aëtes to demand
  the restoration of his daughter.

  Medea threw herself at the feet of the queen, and implored her to save
  her from the anger of her father, and Arete, in her kindness of heart,
  promised her her protection. Next morning, in an assembly of the people
  at which the Colchians were invited to be present, the latter were
  informed that as Medea was the lawful wife of Jason they could not
  consent to deliver her up; whereupon the Colchians, seeing that the
  resolution of the king was not to be shaken, and fearing to face the
  anger of Aëtes should they return to Colchis without her, sought
  permission of Alcinous to settle in his kingdom, which request was
  accorded them.

[229]

  After these events the Argonauts once more set sail, and steered for
  Iolcus; but, in the course of a terrible and fearful night, a mighty
  storm arose, and in the morning they found themselves stranded on the
  treacherous quicksands of Syrtes, on the shores of Libya. Here all was a
  waste and barren desert, untenanted by any living creature, save the
  venomous snakes which had sprung from the blood of the Medusa when borne
  by Perseus over these arid plains.

  They had already passed several days in this abode of desolation,
  beneath the rays of the scorching sun, and had abandoned themselves to
  the deepest despair, when the Libyan queen, who was a prophetess of
  divine origin, appeared to Jason, and informed him that a sea-horse would
  be sent by the gods to act as his guide.

  Scarcely had she departed when a gigantic hippocamp was seen in the
  distance, making its way towards the Argo. Jason now related to his
  companions the particulars of his interview with the Libyan prophetess,
  and after some deliberation it was decided to carry the Argo on their
  shoulders, and to follow wherever the sea-horse should lead them. They
  then commenced a long and weary journey through the desert, and at last,
  after twelve days of severe toil and terrible suffering, the welcome
  sight of the sea greeted their view. In gratitude for having been saved
  from their manifold dangers they offered up sacrifices to the gods, and
  launched their ship once more into the deep waters of the ocean.

  Arrival at Crete.       With heartfelt joy and gladness they
  proceeded on their homeward voyage, and after some days arrived at the
  island of Crete, where they purposed to furnish themselves with fresh
  provisions and water. Their landing, however, was opposed by a terrible
  giant who guarded the island against all intruders. This giant, whose
  name was Talus, was the last of the Brazen race, and being formed of
  brass, was invulnerable, except in his right ankle, where there was a
  sinew of flesh and a vein of blood. As he saw the Argo  !-- Page 230
  -->[230]nearing the
  coast, he hurled huge rocks at her, which would inevitably have sunk the
  vessel had not the crew beat a hasty retreat. Although sadly in want of
  food and water, the Argonauts had decided to proceed on their journey
  rather than face so powerful an opponent, when Medea came forward and
  assured them that if they would trust to her she would destroy the
  giant.

  Enveloped in the folds of a rich purple mantle, she stepped on deck,
  and after invoking the aid of the Fates, uttered a magic incantation,
  which had the effect of throwing Talus into a deep sleep. He stretched
  himself at full length upon the ground, and in doing so grazed his
  vulnerable ankle against the point of a sharp rock, whereupon a mighty
  stream of blood gushed forth from the wound. Awakened by the pain, he
  tried to rise, but in vain, and with a mighty groan of anguish the giant
  fell dead, and his enormous body rolled heavily over into the deep. The
  heroes being now able to land, provisioned their vessel, after which they
  resumed their homeward voyage.

  Arrival at Iolcus.       After a terrible night of storm and
  darkness they passed the island of Ægina, and at length reached in safety
  the port of Iolcus, where the recital of their numerous adventures and
  hair-breadth escapes was listened to with wondering admiration by their
  fellow-countrymen.

  The Argo was consecrated to Poseidon, and was carefully preserved for
  many generations till no vestige of it remained, when it was placed in
  the heavens as a brilliant constellation.

  On his arrival at Iolcus, Jason conducted his beautiful bride to the
  palace of his uncle Pelias, taking with him the Golden Fleece, for the
  sake of which this perilous expedition had been undertaken. But the old
  king, who had never expected that Jason would return alive, basely
  refused to fulfil his part of the compact, and declined to abdicate the
  throne.

[231]

  Indignant at the wrongs of her husband, Medea avenged them in a most
  shocking manner. She made friends with the daughters of the king, and
  feigned great interest in all their concerns. Having gained their
  confidence, she informed them, that among her numerous magic arts, she
  possessed the power of restoring to the aged all the vigour and strength
  of youth, and in order to give them a convincing proof of the truth of
  her assertion, she cut up an old ram, which she boiled in a cauldron,
  whereupon, after uttering various mystic incantations, there came forth
  from the vessel a beautiful young lamb. She then assured them, that in a
  similar manner they could restore to their old father his former youthful
  frame and vigour. The fond and credulous daughters of Pelias lent an all
  too willing ear to the wicked sorceress, and thus the old king perished
  at the hands of his innocent children.

  Death of Jason.       Medea and Jason now fled to Corinth,
  where at length they found, for a time, peace and tranquillity, their
  happiness being completed by the birth of three children.

  As time passed on, however, and Medea began to lose the beauty which
  had won the love of her husband, he grew weary of her, and became
  attracted by the youthful charms of Glauce, the beautiful daughter of
  Creon, king of Corinth. Jason had obtained her father's consent to their
  union, and the wedding-day was already fixed, before he disclosed to
  Medea the treachery which he meditated against her. He used all his
  persuasive powers in order to induce her to consent to his union with
  Glauce, assuring her that his affection had in no way diminished, but
  that for the sake of the advantages which would thereby accrue to their
  children, he had decided on forming this alliance with the royal house.
  Though justly enraged at his deceitful conduct, Medea dissembled her
  wrath, and, feigning to be satisfied with this explanation, sent, as a
  wedding-gift to her rival, a magnificent robe of cloth-of-gold. This robe
  was imbued with a deadly  a
  name="page232">[232]poison which penetrated to the flesh and
  bone of the wearer, and burned them as though with a consuming fire.
  Pleased with the beauty and costliness of the garment, the unsuspecting
  Glauce lost no time in donning it; but no sooner had she done so than the
  fell poison began to take effect. In vain she tried to tear the robe
  away; it defied all efforts to be removed, and after horrible and
  protracted sufferings, she expired.

  Maddened at the loss of her husband's love Medea next put to death her
  three sons, and when Jason, thirsting for revenge, left the chamber of
  his dead bride, and flew to his own house in search of Medea, the ghastly
  spectacle of his murdered children met his view. He rushed frantically to
  seek the murderess, but nowhere could she be found. At length, hearing a
  sound above his head, he looked up, and beheld Medea gliding through the
  air in a golden chariot drawn by dragons.

  In a fit of despair Jason threw himself on his own sword, and perished
  on the threshold of his desolate and deserted home.

PELOPS.

  Pelops, the son of the cruel Tantalus, was a pious and virtuous
  prince. After his father was banished into Tartarus, a war ensued between
  Pelops and the king of Troy, in which the former was vanquished and
  forced to fly from his dominions in Phrygia. He emigrated into Greece,
  where, at the court of        nomaus, king of Elis, he beheld Hippodamia,
  the king's daughter, whose beauty won his heart. But an oracle having
  foretold to        nomaus that he would die on the day of his daughter's
  marriage, he threw every obstacle in the way of her suitors, and declared
  that he would only give her to him who succeeded in vanquishing him in a
  chariot race, but that all unsuccessful competitors should suffer death
  at his hands.

  The conditions of the contest were as follows:       The race was to
  be run from a given point at Pisa to the altar of Poseidon at Corinth;
  the suitor was allowed to start  a
  name="page233">[233]on his course whilst        nomaus
  performed his sacrifice to Zeus, and only on its completion did the king
  mount his chariot, guided by the skilful Myrtilus, and drawn by his two
  famous horses, Phylla and Harpinna, who surpassed in swiftness the winds
  themselves. In this manner many a gallant young prince had perished; for
  although a considerable start was given to all competitors, still
         nomaus, with his swift team, always overtook them before they
  reached the goal, and killed them with his spear. But the love of Pelops
  for Hippodamia overcame all fears, and, undeterred by the terrible fate
  of his predecessors, he announced himself to        nomaus as a suitor
  for the hand of his daughter.

  On the eve of the race, Pelops repaired to the sea-shore and earnestly
  implored Poseidon to assist him in his perilous undertaking. The sea-god
  heard his prayer, and sent him out of the deep a chariot drawn by two
  winged horses.

  When Pelops appeared on the course, the king at once recognized the
  horses of Poseidon; but, nothing daunted, he relied on his own
  supernatural team, and the contest was allowed to proceed.

  Whilst the king was offering his sacrifice to Zeus Pelops set out on
  the race, and had nearly reached the goal, when, turning round, he beheld
         nomaus, spear in hand, who, with his magic steeds, had nearly
  overtaken him. But in this emergency Poseidon came to the aid of the son
  of Tantalus. He caused the wheels of the royal chariot to fly off,
  whereupon the king was thrown out violently, and killed on the spot, just
  as Pelops arrived at the altar of Poseidon.

  As the hero was about to return to Pisa to claim his bride, he beheld,
  in the distance, flames issuing from the royal castle, which at that
  instant had been struck by lightning. With his winged horses he flew to
  rescue his lovely bride, and succeeded in extricating her uninjured from
  the burning building. They soon afterwards became united, and Pelops
  reigned in Pisa for many years in great splendour.

[234]

HERACLES (Hercules).

  Heracles, the most renowned hero of antiquity, was the son of Zeus and
  Alcmene, and the great grandson of Perseus.

  At the time of his birth Alcmene was living at Thebes with her husband
  Amphitryon, and thus the infant Heracles was born in the palace of his
  stepfather.

  Aware of the animosity with which Hera persecuted all those who
  rivalled her in the affections of Zeus, Alcmene, fearful lest this hatred
  should be visited on her innocent child, intrusted him, soon after his
  birth, to the care of a faithful servant, with instructions to expose him
  in a certain field, and there leave him, feeling assured that the divine
  offspring of Zeus would not long remain without the protection of the
  gods.

  Soon after the child had been thus abandoned, Hera and Pallas-Athene
  happened to pass by the field, and were attracted by its cries. Athene
  pityingly took up the infant in her arms, and prevailed upon the queen of
  heaven to put it to her breast; but no sooner had she done so, than the
  child, causing her pain, she angrily threw him to the ground, and left
  the spot. Athene, moved with compassion, carried him to Alcmene, and
  entreated her kind offices on behalf of the poor little foundling.
  Alcmene at once recognized her child, and joyfully accepted the
  charge.

  Soon afterwards Hera, to her extreme annoyance, discovered whom she
  had nursed, and became filled with jealous rage. She now sent two
  venomous snakes into the chamber of Alcmene, which crept, unperceived by
  the nurses, to the cradle of the sleeping child. He awoke with a cry, and
  grasping a snake in each hand, strangled them both. Alcmene and her
  attendants, whom the cry of the child had awakened, rushed to the cradle,
  where, to their astonishment and terror, they beheld the two reptiles
  dead in the hands of the infant Heracles. Amphitryon was also attracted
  to the chamber by the  a
  name="page235">[235]commotion, and when he beheld this
  astounding proof of supernatural strength, he declared that the child
  must have been sent to him as a special gift from Zeus. He accordingly
  consulted the famous seer Tiresias, who now informed him of the divine
  origin of his stepson, and prognosticated for him a great and
  distinguished future.

  When Amphitryon heard the noble destiny which awaited the child
  intrusted to his care, he resolved to educate him in a manner worthy of
  his future career. At a suitable age he himself taught him how to guide a
  chariot; Eurytus, how to handle the bow; Autolycus, dexterity in
  wrestling and boxing; and Castor, the art of armed warfare; whilst Linus,
  the son of Apollo, instructed him in music and letters.

  Heracles was an apt pupil; but undue harshness was intolerable to his
  high spirit, and old Linus, who was not the gentlest of teachers, one day
  corrected him with blows, whereupon the boy angrily took up his lyre,
  and, with one stroke of his powerful arm, killed his tutor on the
  spot.

  Apprehensive lest the ungovernable temper of the youth might again
  involve him in similar acts of violence, Amphitryon sent him into the
  country, where he placed him under the charge of one of his most trusted
  herdsmen. Here, as he grew up to manhood, his extraordinary stature and
  strength became the wonder and admiration of all beholders. His aim,
  whether with spear, lance, or bow, was unerring, and at the age of
  eighteen he was considered to be the strongest as well as the most
  beautiful youth in all Greece.

  The Choice of Heracles.       Heracles felt that the time had
  now arrived when it became necessary to decide for himself how to make
  use of the extraordinary powers with which he had been endowed by the
  gods; and in order to meditate in solitude on this all-important subject,
  he repaired to a lonely and secluded spot in the heart of the forest.

  Here two females of great beauty appeared to him.  !-- Page 236
  -->[236]One was Vice,
  the other Virtue. The former was full of artificial wiles and fascinating
  arts, her face painted and her dress gaudy and attractive; whilst the
  latter was of noble bearing and modest mien, her robes of spotless
  purity.

  Vice stepped forward and thus addressed him: "If you will walk in my
  paths, and make me your friend, your life shall be one round of pleasure
  and enjoyment. You shall taste of every delight which can be procured on
  earth; the choicest viands, the most delicious wines, the most luxuriant
  of couches shall be ever at your disposal; and all this without any
  exertion on your part, either physical or mental."

  Virtue now spoke in her turn: "If you will follow me and be my friend,
  I promise you the reward of a good conscience, and the love and respect
  of your fellowmen. I cannot undertake to smooth your path with roses, or
  to give you a life of idleness and pleasure; for you must know that the
  gods grant no good and desirable thing that is not earned by labour; and
  as you sow, so must you reap."

  Heracles listened patiently and attentively to both speakers, and
  then, after mature deliberation, decided to follow in the paths of
  virtue, and henceforth to honour the gods, and to devote his life to the
  service of his country.

  Full of these noble resolves he sought once more his rural home, where
  he was informed that on Mount Cithæron, at the foot of which the herds of
  Amphitryon were grazing, a ferocious lion had fixed his lair, and was
  committing such frightful ravages among the flocks and herds that he had
  become the scourge and terror of the whole neighbourhood. Heracles at
  once armed himself and ascended the mountain, where he soon caught sight
  of the lion, and rushing at him with his sword succeeded in killing him.
  The hide of the animal he wore ever afterwards over his shoulders, and
  the head served him as a helmet.

  As he was returning from this, his first exploit, he met  !-- Page 237
  -->[237]the heralds of
  Erginus, king of the Minyans, who were proceeding to Thebes to demand
  their annual tribute of 100 oxen. Indignant at this humiliation of his
  native city, Heracles mutilated the heralds, and sent them back, with
  ropes round their necks, to their royal master.

  Erginus was so incensed at the ill-treatment of his messengers that he
  collected an army and appeared before the gates of Thebes, demanding the
  surrender of Heracles. Creon, who was at this time king of Thebes,
  fearing the consequences of a refusal, was about to yield, when the hero,
  with the assistance of Amphitryon and a band of brave youths, advanced
  against the Minyans.

  Heracles took possession of a narrow defile through which the enemy
  were compelled to pass, and as they entered the pass the Thebans fell
  upon them, killed their king Erginus, and completely routed them. In this
  engagement Amphitryon, the kind friend and foster-father of Heracles,
  lost his life. The hero now advanced upon Orchomenus, the capital of the
  Minyans, where he burned the royal castle and sacked the town.

  After this signal victory all Greece rang with the fame of the young
  hero, and Creon, in gratitude for his great services, bestowed upon him
  his daughter Megara in marriage. The Olympian gods testified their
  appreciation of his valour by sending him presents; Hermes gave him a
  sword, Ph       bus-Apollo a bundle of arrows, Hephæstus a golden quiver,
  and Athene a coat of leather.

  Heracles and Eurystheus.       And now it will be necessary to
  retrace our steps. Just before the birth of Heracles, Zeus, in an
  assembly of the gods, exultingly declared that the child who should be
  born on that day to the house of Perseus should rule over all his race.
  When Hera heard her lord's boastful announcement she knew well that it
  was for the child of the hated Alcmene that this brilliant destiny was
  designed; and in order to rob the son of her rival of his rights, she
  called to her aid the goddess Eilithyia, who retarded the birth of  !--
  Page 238 --> a
  name="page238">[238]Heracles, and caused his cousin Eurystheus
  (another grandson of Perseus) to precede him into the world. And thus, as
  the word of the mighty Zeus was irrevocable, Heracles became the subject
  and servant of his cousin Eurystheus.

  When, after his splendid victory over Erginus, the fame of Heracles
  spread throughout Greece, Eurystheus (who had become king of Mycenæ),
  jealous of the reputation of the young hero, asserted his rights, and
  commanded him to undertake for him various difficult tasks. But the proud
  spirit of the hero rebelled against this humiliation, and he was about to
  refuse compliance, when Zeus appeared to him and desired him not to rebel
  against the Fates. Heracles now repaired to Delphi in order to consult
  the oracle, and received the answer that after performing ten tasks for
  his cousin Eurystheus his servitude would be at an end.

  Soon afterwards Heracles fell into a state of the deepest melancholy,
  and through the influence of his inveterate enemy, the goddess Hera, this
  despondency developed into raving madness, in which condition he killed
  his own children. When he at length regained his reason he was so
  horrified and grieved at what he had done, that he shut himself up in his
  chamber and avoided all intercourse with men. But in his loneliness and
  seclusion the conviction that work would be the best means of procuring
  oblivion of the past decided him to enter, without delay, upon the tasks
  appointed him by Eurystheus.

  1. The Nemean Lion.       His first task was to bring to
  Eurystheus the skin of the much-dreaded Nemean lion, which ravaged the
  territory between Cleone and Nemea, and whose hide was invulnerable
  against any mortal weapon.

  Heracles proceeded to the forest of Nemea, where, having discovered
  the lion's lair, he attempted to pierce him with his arrows; but finding
  these of no avail he felled him to the ground with his club, and before
  the animal had time to recover from the terrible blow,  !-- Page 239
  -->[239]Heracles
  seized him by the neck and, with a mighty effort, succeeded in strangling
  him. He then made himself a coat of mail of the skin, and a new helmet of
  the head of the animal. Thus attired, he so alarmed Eurystheus by
  appearing suddenly before him, that the king concealed himself in his
  palace, and henceforth forbade Heracles to enter his presence, but
  commanded him to receive his behests, for the future, through his
  messenger Copreus.

  2. The Hydra.       His second task was to slay the Hydra, a
  monster serpent (the offspring of Typhon and Echidna), bristling with
  nine heads, one of which was immortal. This monster infested the
  neighbourhood of Lerna, where she committed great depredations among the
  herds.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0239-1.png"
      alt="Heracles fighting the Hydra" title="Heracles fighting the Hydra" />
  
  Heracles, accompanied by his nephew Iolaus, set out in a chariot for
  the marsh of Lerna, in the slimy waters of which he found her. He
  commenced the attack by assailing her with his fierce arrows, in order to
  force her to leave her lair, from which she at length emerged, and sought
  refuge in a wood on a neighbouring hill. Heracles now rushed forward and
  endeavoured to crush her heads by means of well-directed blows from his
  tremendous club; but no sooner was one head destroyed than it was
  immediately replaced by two others. He next seized the monster in his
  powerful grasp; but at this juncture a giant crab came to the assistance
  of the Hydra and commenced biting the feet of her assailant. Heracles
  destroyed this new adversary with his club, and now called upon his
  nephew to come to his aid. At his command Iolaus set fire to the
  neighbouring trees,  a
  name="page240">[240]and, with a burning branch, seared the
  necks of the monster as Heracles cut them off, thus effectually
  preventing the growth of more. Heracles next struck off the immortal
  head, which he buried by the road-side, and placed over it a heavy stone.
  Into the poisonous blood of the monster he then dipped his arrows, which
  ever afterwards rendered wounds inflicted by them incurable.

  3. The Horned Hind.       The third labour of Heracles was to
  bring the horned hind Cerunitis alive to Mycenæ. This animal, which was
  sacred to Artemis, had golden antlers and hoofs of brass.

  Not wishing to wound the hind Heracles patiently pursued her through
  many countries for a whole year, and overtook her at last on the banks of
  the river Ladon; but even there he was compelled, in order to secure her,
  to wound her with one of his arrows, after which he lifted her on his
  shoulders and carried her through Arcadia. On his way he met Artemis with
  her brother Ph       bus-Apollo, when the goddess angrily reproved him
  for wounding her favourite hind; but Heracles succeeded in appeasing her
  displeasure, whereupon she permitted him to take the animal alive to
  Mycenæ.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0240-1.png"
      alt="A Centaur" title="A Centaur" />
  
  4. The Erymantian Boar.       The fourth task imposed upon
  Heracles by Eurystheus was to bring alive to Mycenæ the Erymantian boar,
  which had laid waste the region of Erymantia, and was the scourge of the
  surrounding neighbourhood.

  On his way thither he craved food and shelter of a Centaur named
  Pholus, who received him with generous hospitality, setting before him a
  good and plentiful repast. When Heracles expressed his surprise that at
  such a well-furnished board  a
  name="page241">[241]wine should be wanting, his host explained
  that the wine-cellar was the common property of all the Centaurs, and
  that it was against the rules for a cask to be broached, except all were
  present to partake of it. By dint of persuasion, however, Heracles
  prevailed on his kind host to make an exception in his favour; but the
  powerful, luscious odour of the good old wine soon spread over the
  mountains, and brought large numbers of Centaurs to the spot, all armed
  with huge rocks and fir-trees. Heracles drove them back with fire-brands,
  and then, following up his victory, pursued them with his arrows as far
  as Malea, where they took refuge in the cave of the kind old Centaur
  Chiron. Unfortunately, however, as Heracles was shooting at them with his
  poisoned darts, one of these pierced the knee of Chiron. When Heracles
  discovered that it was the friend of his early days that he had wounded,
  he was overcome with sorrow and regret. He at once extracted the arrow,
  and anointed the wound with a salve, the virtue of which had been taught
  him by Chiron himself. But all his efforts were unavailing. The wound,
  imbued with the deadly poison of the Hydra, was incurable, and so great
  was the agony of Chiron that, at the intercession of Heracles, death was
  sent him by the gods; for otherwise, being immortal, he would have been
  doomed to endless suffering.

  Pholus, who had so kindly entertained Heracles, also perished by means
  of one of these arrows, which he had extracted from the body of a dead
  Centaur. While he was quietly examining it, astonished that so small and
  insignificant an object should be productive of such serious results, the
  arrow fell upon his foot and fatally wounded him. Full of grief at this
  untoward event, Heracles buried him with due honours, and then set out to
  chase the boar.

  With loud shouts and terrible cries he first drove him out of the
  thickets into the deep snow-drifts which covered the summit of the
  mountain, and then, having at length wearied him with his incessant
  pursuit, he captured the exhausted animal, bound him with a rope, and
  brought him alive to Mycenæ.

[242]

  5. Cleansing the Stables of Augeas.       After slaying the
  Erymantian boar Eurystheus commanded Heracles to cleanse in one day the
  stables of Augeas.

  Augeas was a king of Elis who was very rich in herds. Three thousand
  of his cattle he kept near the royal palace in an inclosure where the
  refuse had accumulated for many years. When Heracles presented himself
  before the king, and offered to cleanse his stables in one day, provided
  he should receive in return a tenth part of the herds, Augeas, thinking
  the feat impossible, accepted his offer in the presence of his son
  Phyleus.

  Near the palace were the two rivers Peneus and Alpheus, the streams of
  which Heracles conducted into the stables by means of a trench which he
  dug for this purpose, and as the waters rushed through the shed, they
  swept away with them the whole mass of accumulated filth.

  But when Augeas heard that this was one of the labours imposed by
  Eurystheus, he refused the promised guerdon. Heracles brought the matter
  before a court, and called Phyleus as a witness to the justice of his
  claim, whereupon Augeas, without waiting for the delivery of the verdict,
  angrily banished Heracles and his son from his dominions.

  6. The Stymphalides.       The sixth task was to chase away the
  Stymphalides, which were immense birds of prey who, as we have seen (in
  the legend of the Argonauts), shot from their wings feathers sharp as
  arrows. The home of these birds was on the shore of the lake Stymphalis,
  in Arcadia (after which they were called), where they caused great
  destruction among men and cattle.

  On approaching the lake, Heracles observed great numbers of them; and,
  while hesitating how to commence the attack, he suddenly felt a hand on
  his shoulder. Looking round he beheld the majestic form of Pallas-Athene,
  who held in her hand a gigantic pair of brazen clappers made by
  Hephæstus, with which she  a
  name="page243">[243]presented him; whereupon he ascended to
  the summit of a neighbouring hill, and commenced to rattle them
  violently. The shrill noise of these instruments was so intolerable to
  the birds that they rose into the air in terror, upon which he aimed at
  them with his arrows, destroying them in great numbers, whilst such as
  escaped his darts flew away, never to return.

  7. The Cretan Bull.       The seventh labour of Heracles was to
  capture the Cretan bull.

  Minos, king of Crete, having vowed to sacrifice to Poseidon any animal
  which should first appear out of the sea, the god caused a magnificent
  bull to emerge from the waves in order to test the sincerity of the
  Cretan king, who, in making this vow, had alleged that he possessed no
  animal, among his own herds, worthy the acceptance of the mighty sea-god.
  Charmed with the splendid animal sent by Poseidon, and eager to possess
  it, Minos placed it among his herds, and substituted as a sacrifice one
  of his own bulls. Hereupon Poseidon, in order to punish the cupidity of
  Minos, caused the animal to become mad, and commit such great havoc in
  the island as to endanger the safety of the inhabitants. When Heracles,
  therefore, arrived in Crete for the purpose of capturing the bull, Minos,
  far from opposing his design, gladly gave him permission to do so.

  The hero not only succeeded in securing the animal, but tamed him so
  effectually that he rode on his back right across the sea as far as the
  Peloponnesus. He now delivered him up to Eurystheus, who at once set him
  at liberty, after which he became as ferocious and wild as before, roamed
  all over Greece into Arcadia, and was eventually killed by Theseus on the
  plains of Marathon.

  8. The Mares of Diomedes.       The eighth labour of Heracles
  was to bring to Eurystheus the mares of Diomedes, a son of Ares, and king
  of the Bistonians, a warlike Thracian tribe. This king possessed a breed
  of wild horses of tremendous size and strength, whose food consisted of
  human flesh, and all strangers who had the  span
  class="pagenum">[244]misfortune to enter the
  country were made prisoners and flung before the horses, who devoured
  them.

  When Heracles arrived he first captured the cruel Diomedes himself,
  and then threw him before his own mares, who, after devouring their
  master, became perfectly tame and tractable. They were then led by
  Heracles to the sea-shore, when the Bistonians, enraged at the loss of
  their king, rushed after the hero and attacked him. He now gave the
  animals in charge of his friend Abderus, and made such a furious
  onslaught on his assailants that they turned and fled.

  But on his return from this encounter he found, to his great grief,
  that the mares had torn his friend in pieces and devoured him. After
  celebrating due funereal rites to the unfortunate Abderus, Heracles built
  a city in his honour, which he named after him. He then returned to
  Tiryns, where he delivered up the mares to Eurystheus, who set them loose
  on Mount Olympus, where they became the prey of wild beasts.

  It was after the performance of this task that Heracles joined the
  Argonauts in their expedition to gain possession of the Golden Fleece,
  and was left behind at Chios, as already narrated. During his wanderings
  he undertook his ninth labour, which was to bring to Eurystheus the
  girdle of Hippolyte, queen of the Amazons.

  9. The Girdle of Hippolyte.       The Amazons, who dwelt on the
  shores of the Black Sea, near the river Thermodon, were a nation of
  warlike women, renowned for their strength, courage, and great skill in
  horsemanship. Their queen, Hippolyte, had received from her father, Ares,
  a beautiful girdle, which she always wore as a sign of her royal power
  and authority, and it was this girdle which Heracles was required to
  place in the hands of Eurystheus, who designed it as a gift for his
  daughter Admete.

  Foreseeing that this would be a task of no ordinary difficulty the
  hero called to his aid a select band of brave companions, with whom he
  embarked for the Amazonian  a
  name="page245">[245]town Themiscyra. Here they were met by
  queen Hippolyte, who was so impressed by the extraordinary stature and
  noble bearing of Heracles that, on learning his errand, she at once
  consented to present him with the coveted girdle. But Hera, his
  implacable enemy, assuming the form of an Amazon, spread the report in
  the town that a stranger was about to carry off their queen. The Amazons
  at once flew to arms and mounted their horses, whereupon a battle ensued,
  in which many of their bravest warriors were killed or wounded. Among the
  latter was their most skilful leader, Melanippe, whom Heracles afterwards
  restored to Hippolyte, receiving the girdle in exchange.

  On his voyage home the hero stopped at Troy, where a new adventure
  awaited him.

  During the time that Apollo and Poseidon were condemned by Zeus to a
  temporary servitude on earth, they built for king Laomedon the famous
  walls of Troy, afterwards so renowned in history; but when their work was
  completed the king treacherously refused to give them the reward due to
  them. The incensed deities now combined to punish the offender. Apollo
  sent a pestilence which decimated the people, and Poseidon a flood, which
  bore with it a marine monster, who swallowed in his huge jaws all that
  came within his reach.

  In his distress Laomedon consulted an oracle, and was informed that
  only by the sacrifice of his own daughter Hesione could the anger of the
  gods be appeased. Yielding at length to the urgent appeals of his people
  he consented to make the sacrifice, and on the arrival of Heracles the
  maiden was already chained to a rock in readiness to be devoured by the
  monster.

  When Laomedon beheld the renowned hero, whose marvellous feats of
  strength and courage had become the wonder and admiration of all mankind,
  he earnestly implored him to save his daughter from her impending fate,
  and to rid the country of the monster, holding out to him as a reward the
  horses which Zeus had presented to  span
  class="pagenum">[246]his grandfather Tros in
  compensation for robbing him of his son Ganymede.

  Heracles unhesitatingly accepted the offer, and when the monster
  appeared, opening his terrible jaws to receive his prey, the hero, sword
  in hand, attacked and slew him. But the perfidious monarch once more
  broke faith, and Heracles, vowing future vengeance, departed for Mycenæ,
  where he presented the girdle to Eurystheus.

  10. The Oxen of Geryones.       The tenth labour of Heracles
  was the capture of the magnificent oxen belonging to the giant Geryon or
  Geryones, who dwelt on the island of Erythia in the bay of Gadria
  (Cadiz). This giant, who was the son of Chrysaor, had three bodies with
  three heads, six hands, and six feet. He possessed a herd of splendid
  cattle, which were famous for their size, beauty, and rich red colour.
  They were guarded by another giant named Eurytion, and a two-headed dog
  called Orthrus, the offspring of Typhon and Echidna.

  In choosing for him a task so replete with danger, Eurystheus was in
  hopes that he might rid himself for ever of his hated cousin. But the
  indomitable courage of the hero rose with the prospect of this difficult
  and dangerous undertaking.

  After a long and wearisome journey he at last arrived at the western
  coast of Africa, where, as a monument of his perilous expedition, he
  erected the famous "Pillars of Hercules," one of which he placed on each
  side of the Straits of Gibraltar. Here he found the intense heat so
  insufferable that he angrily raised his bow towards heaven, and
  threatened to shoot the sun-god. But Helios, far from being incensed at
  his audacity, was so struck with admiration at his daring that he lent to
  him the golden boat with which he accomplished his nocturnal transit from
  West to East, and thus Heracles crossed over safely to the island of
  Erythia.

  No sooner had he landed than Eurytion, accompanied by his savage dog
  Orthrus, fiercely attacked him; but Heracles, with a superhuman effort,
  slew the dog and  a
  name="page247">[247]then his master. Hereupon he collected the
  herd, and was proceeding to the sea-shore when Geryones himself met him,
  and a desperate encounter took place, in which the giant perished.

  Heracles then drove the cattle into the sea, and seizing one of the
  oxen by the horns, swam with them over to the opposite coast of Iberia
  (Spain). Then driving his magnificent prize before him through Gaul,
  Italy, Illyria, and Thrace, he at length arrived, after many perilous
  adventures and hair-breadth escapes, at Mycenæ, where he delivered them
  up to Eurystheus, who sacrificed them to Hera.

  Heracles had now executed his ten tasks, which had been accomplished
  in the space of eight years; but Eurystheus refused to include the
  slaying of the Hydra and the cleansing of the stables of Augeas among the
  number, alleging as a reason that the one had been performed by the
  assistance of Iolaus, and that the other had been executed for hire. He
  therefore insisted on Heracles substituting two more labours in their
  place.

  11. The Apples of the Hesperides.       The eleventh task
  imposed by Eurystheus was to bring him the golden apples of the
  Hesperides, which grew on a tree presented by Gæa to Hera, on the
  occasion of her marriage with Zeus. This sacred tree was guarded by four
  maidens, daughters of Night, called the Hesperides, who were assisted in
  their task by a terrible hundred-headed dragon. This dragon never slept,
  and out of its hundred throats came a constant hissing sound, which
  effectually warned off all intruders. But what rendered the undertaking
  still more difficult was the complete ignorance of the hero as to the
  locality of the garden, and he was forced, in consequence, to make many
  fruitless journeys and to undergo many trials before he could find
  it.

  He first travelled through Thessaly and arrived at the river
  Echedorus, where he met the giant Cycnus, the son of Ares and Pyrene, who
  challenged him to single combat. In this encounter Heracles completely
  vanquished  a
  name="page248">[248]his opponent, who was killed in the
  contest; but now a mightier adversary appeared on the scene, for the
  war-god himself came to avenge his son. A terrible struggle ensued, which
  had lasted some time, when Zeus interfered between the brothers, and put
  an end to the strife by hurling a thunderbolt between them. Heracles
  proceeded on his journey, and reached the banks of the river Eridanus,
  where dwelt the Nymphs, daughters of Zeus and Themis. On seeking advice
  from them as to his route, they directed him to the old sea-god Nereus,
  who alone knew the way to the Garden of the Hesperides. Heracles found
  him asleep, and seizing the opportunity, held him so firmly in his
  powerful grasp that he could not possibly escape, so that notwithstanding
  his various metamorphoses he was at last compelled to give the
  information required. The hero then crossed over to Libya, where he
  engaged in a wrestling-match with king Anteos, son of Poseidon and Gæa,
  which terminated fatally for his antagonist.

  From thence he proceeded to Egypt, where reigned Busiris, another son
  of Poseidon, who (acting on the advice given by an oracle during a time
  of great scarcity) sacrificed all strangers to Zeus. When Heracles
  arrived he was seized and dragged to the altar; but the powerful demi-god
  burst asunder his bonds, and then slew Busiris and his son.

  Resuming his journey he now wandered on through Arabia until he
  arrived at Mount Caucasus, where Prometheus groaned in unceasing agony.
  It was at this time that Heracles (as already related) shot the eagle
  which had so long tortured the noble and devoted friend of mankind. Full
  of gratitude for his deliverance, Prometheus instructed him how to find
  his way to that remote region in the far West where Atlas supported the
  heavens on his shoulders, near which lay the Garden of the Hesperides. He
  also warned Heracles not to attempt to secure the precious fruit himself,
  but to assume for a time the duties of Atlas, and to despatch him for the
  apples.  a
  name="page249">[249]

  On arriving at his destination Heracles followed the advice of
  Prometheus. Atlas, who willingly entered into the arrangement, contrived
  to put the dragon to sleep, and then, having cunningly outwitted the
  Hesperides, carried off three of the golden apples, which he now brought
  to Heracles. But when the latter was prepared to relinquish his burden,
  Atlas, having once tasted the delights of freedom, declined to resume his
  post, and announced his intention of being himself the bearer of the
  apples to Eurystheus, leaving Heracles to fill his place. To this
  proposal the hero feigned assent, merely begging that Atlas would be kind
  enough to support the heavens for a few moments whilst he contrived a pad
  for his head. Atlas good-naturedly threw down the apples and once more
  resumed his load, upon which Heracles bade him adieu, and departed.

  When Heracles conveyed the golden apples to Eurystheus the latter
  presented them to the hero, whereupon Heracles placed the sacred fruit on
  the altar of Pallas-Athene, who restored them to the garden of the
  Hesperides.

  12. Cerberus.       The twelfth and last labour which
  Eurystheus imposed on Heracles was to bring up Cerberus from the lower
  world, believing that all his heroic powers would be unavailing in the
  Realm of Shades, and that in this, his last and most perilous
  undertaking, the hero must at length succumb and perish.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0249-1.png"
      alt="Cerberus" title="Cerberus" />
  
  Cerberus was a monster dog with three heads, out of whose awful jaws
  dripped poison; the hair of his head and back was formed of venomous
  snakes, and his body terminated in the tail of a dragon.

  After being initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries, and  !-- Page 250
  -->[250]obtaining from
  the priests certain information necessary for the accomplishment of his
  task, Heracles set out for Tænarum in Lacolia, where there was an opening
  which led to the under-world. Conducted by Hermes, he commenced his
  descent into the awful gulf, where myriads of shades soon began to
  appear, all of whom fled in terror at his approach, Meleager and Medusa
  alone excepted. About to strike the latter with his sword, Hermes
  interfered and stayed his hand, reminding him that she was but a shadow,
  and that consequently no weapon could avail against her.

  Arrived before the gates of Hades he found Theseus and Pirithöus, who
  had been fixed to an enchanted rock by Aïdes for their presumption in
  endeavouring to carry off Persephone. When they saw Heracles they
  implored him to set them free. The hero succeeded in delivering Theseus,
  but when he endeavoured to liberate Pirithöus, the earth shook so
  violently beneath him that he was compelled to relinquish his task.

  Proceeding further Heracles recognized Ascalaphus, who, as we have
  seen in the history of Demeter, had revealed the fact that Persephone had
  swallowed the seeds of a pomegranate offered to her by her husband, which
  bound her to Aïdes for ever. Ascalaphus was groaning beneath a huge rock
  which Demeter in her anger had hurled upon him, and which Heracles now
  removed, releasing the sufferer.

  Before the gates of his palace stood Aïdes the mighty ruler of the
  lower world, and barred his entrance; but Heracles, aiming at him with
  one of his unerring darts, shot him in the shoulder, so that for the
  first time the god experienced the agony of mortal suffering. Heracles
  then demanded of him permission to take Cerberus to the upper-world, and
  to this Aïdes consented on condition that he should secure him unarmed.
  Protected by his breastplate and lion's skin Heracles went in search of
  the monster, whom he found at the mouth of the river Acheron. Undismayed
  by the hideous barking which proceeded from his three heads, he seized
  the  a
  name="page251">[251]throat with one hand and the legs with the
  other, and although the dragon which served him as a tail bit him
  severely, he did not relinquish his grasp. In this manner he conducted
  him to the upper-world, through an opening near Troezen in Argolia.

  When Eurystheus beheld Cerberus he stood aghast, and despairing of
  ever getting rid of his hated rival, he returned the hell-hound to the
  hero, who restored him to Aïdes, and with this last task the subjection
  of Heracles to Eurystheus terminated.

  Murder of Iphitus.       Free at last Heracles now returned to
  Thebes; and it being impossible for him to live happily with Megara in
  consequence of his having murdered her children he, with her own consent,
  gave her in marriage to his nephew Iolaus. Heracles himself sought the
  hand of Iole, daughter of Eurytus, king of        chalia, who had
  instructed him when a boy in the use of the bow. Hearing that this king
  had promised to give his daughter to him who could surpass himself and
  his three sons in shooting with the bow, Heracles lost no time in
  presenting himself as a competitor. He soon proved that he was no
  unworthy pupil of Eurytus, for he signally defeated all his opponents.
  But although the king treated him with marked respect and honour he
  refused, nevertheless, to give him the hand of his daughter, fearing for
  her a similar fate to that which had befallen Megara. Iphitus, the eldest
  son of Eurytus, alone espoused the cause of Heracles, and essayed to
  induce his father to give his consent to the marriage; but all to no
  purpose, and at length, stung to the quick at his rejection, the hero
  angrily took his departure.

  Soon afterwards the oxen of the king were stolen by the notorious
  thief Autolycus, and Heracles was suspected by Eurytus of having
  committed the theft. But Iphitus loyally defended his absent friend, and
  proposed to seek out Heracles, and with his assistance to go in search of
  the missing cattle.  a
  name="page252">[252]

  The hero warmly welcomed his staunch young friend, and entered
  cordially into his plan. They at once set out on their expedition; but
  their search proved altogether unsuccessful. When they approached the
  city of Tiryns they mounted a tower in hopes of discovering the missing
  herd in the surrounding country; but as they stood on the topmost summit
  of the building, Heracles became suddenly seized with one of his former
  attacks of madness, and mistaking his friend Iphitus for an enemy, hurled
  him down into the plain below, and he was killed on the spot.

  Heracles now set forth on a weary pilgrimage, begging in vain that
  some one would purify him from the murder of Iphitus. It was during these
  wanderings that he arrived at the palace of his friend Admetus, whose
  beautiful and heroic wife (Alcestes) he restored to her husband after a
  terrible struggle with Death, as already related.

  Soon after this event Heracles was struck with a fearful disease, and
  betook himself to the temple of Delphi, hoping to obtain from the oracle
  the means of relief. The priestess, however, refused him a response on
  the ground of his having murdered Iphitus, whereupon the angry hero
  seized upon the tripod, which he carried off, declaring that he would
  construct an oracle for himself. Apollo, who witnessed the sacrilege,
  came down to defend his sanctuary, and a violent struggle ensued. Zeus
  once more interfered, and, flashing his lightnings between his two
  favourite sons, ended the combat. The Pythia now vouchsafed an answer to
  the prayer of the hero, and commanded him, in expiation of his crime, to
  allow himself to be sold by Hermes for three years as a slave, the
  purchase-money to be given to Eurytus in compensation for the loss of his
  son.

  Heracles becomes the Slave of Omphale.       Heracles bowed in
  submission to the divine will, and was conducted by Hermes to Omphale,
  queen of Lydia. The three talents which she paid for him were given  !--
  Page 253 -->[253]to
  Eurytus, who, however, declined to accept the money, which was handed
  over to the children of Iphitus.

  Heracles now regained his former vigour. He rid the territory of
  Omphale of the robbers which infested it and performed for her various
  other services requiring strength and courage. It was about this time
  that he took part in the Calydonian boar-hunt, details of which have
  already been given.

  When Omphale learned that her slave was none other than the renowned
  Heracles himself she at once gave him his liberty, and offered him her
  hand and kingdom. In her palace Heracles abandoned himself to all the
  enervating luxuries of an oriental life, and so completely was the great
  hero enthralled by the fascination which his mistress exercised over him,
  that whilst she playfully donned his lion's skin and helmet, he, attired
  in female garments, sat at her feet spinning wool, and beguiling the time
  by the relation of his past adventures.

  But when at length, his term of bondage having expired, he became
  master of his own actions, the manly and energetic spirit of the hero
  reasserted itself, and tearing himself away from the palace of the
  Mæonian queen, he determined to carry out the revenge he had so long
  meditated against the treacherous Laomedon and the faithless Augeas.

  Heracles executes vengeance on Laomedon and
  Augeas.       Gathering round him some of his old brave
  companions-in-arms, Heracles collected a fleet of vessels and set sail
  for Troy, where he landed, took the city by storm, and killed Laomedon,
  who thus met at length the retribution he had so richly deserved.

  To Telamon, one of his bravest followers, he gave Hesione, the
  daughter of the king, in marriage. When Heracles gave her permission to
  release one of the prisoners of war she chose her own brother Podarces,
  whereupon she was informed that as he was already a prisoner of war she
  would be compelled to ransom him.  span
  class="pagenum">[254]On hearing this Hesione
  took off her golden diadem, which she joyfully handed to the hero. Owing
  to this circumstance Podarces henceforth bore the name of Priamus (or
  Priam), which signifies the "ransomed one."

  Heracles now marched against Augeas to execute his vengeance on him
  also for his perfidious conduct. He stormed the city of Elis and put to
  death Augeas and his sons, sparing only his brave advocate and staunch
  defender Phyleus, on whom he bestowed the vacant throne of his
  father.

  Heracles and Deianeira.       Heracles now proceeded to
  Calydon, where he wooed the beautiful Deianeira, daughter of        neus,
  king of Ætolia; but he encountered a formidable rival in Achelous, the
  river-god, and it was agreed that their claims should be decided by
  single combat. Trusting to his power of assuming various forms at will,
  Achelous felt confident of success; but this availed him nothing, for
  having at last transformed himself into a bull, his mighty adversary
  broke off one of his horns, and compelled him to acknowledge himself
  defeated.

  After passing three happy years with Deianeira an unfortunate accident
  occurred, which for a time marred their felicity. Heracles was one day
  present at a banquet given by        neus, when, by a sudden swing of his
  hand, he had the misfortune to strike on the head a youth of noble birth,
  who, according to the custom of the ancients, was serving the guests at
  table, and so violent was the blow that it caused his death. The father
  of the unfortunate youth, who had witnessed the occurrence, saw that it
  was the result of accident, and therefore absolved the hero from blame.
  But Heracles resolved to act according to the law of the land, banished
  himself from the country, and bidding farewell to his father-in-law, set
  out for Trachin to visit his friend King Ceyx, taking with him his wife
  Deianeira, and his young son Hyllus.

  In the course of their journey they arrived at the river Evenus, over
  which the Centaur Nessus was in the habit  span
  class="pagenum">[255]of carrying travellers
  for hire. Heracles, with his little son in his arms, forded the stream
  unaided, intrusting his wife to the care of the Centaur, who, charmed
  with the beauty of his fair burden, attempted to carry her off. But her
  cries were heard by her husband, who without hesitation shot Nessus
  through the heart with one of his poisoned arrows. Now the dying Centaur
  was thirsting for revenge. He called Deianeira to his side, and directed
  her to secure some of the blood which flowed from his wound, assuring her
  that if, when in danger of losing her husband's affection, she used it in
  the manner indicated by him, it would act as a charm, and prevent her
  from being supplanted by a rival. Heracles and Deianeira now pursued
  their journey, and after several adventures at length arrived at their
  destination.

  Death of Heracles.       The last expedition undertaken by the
  great hero was against Eurytus, king of        chalia, to revenge himself
  upon this king and his sons for having refused to bestow upon him the
  hand of Iole, after having fairly won the maiden. Having collected a
  large army Heracles set out for Eub       a in order to besiege
         chalia, its capital. Success crowned his arms. He stormed the
  citadel, slew the king and his three sons, reduced the town to ashes, and
  carried away captive the young and beautiful Iole.

  Returning from his victorious expedition, Heracles halted at
  Cen       us in order to offer a sacrifice to Zeus, and sent to Deianeira
  to Trachin for a sacrificial robe. Deianeira having been informed that
  the fair Iole was in the train of Heracles was fearful lest her youthful
  charms might supplant her in the affection of her husband, and calling to
  mind the advice of the dying Centaur, she determined to test the efficacy
  of the love-charm which he had given to her. Taking out the phial which
  she had carefully preserved, she imbued the robe with a portion of the
  liquid which it contained, and then sent it to Heracles.

  The victorious hero clothed himself with the garment,  !-- Page 256
  -->[256]and was about
  to perform the sacrifice, when the hot flames rising from the altar
  heated the poison with which it was imbued, and soon every fibre of his
  body was penetrated by the deadly venom. The unfortunate hero, suffering
  the most fearful tortures, endeavoured to tear off the robe, but it
  adhered so closely to the skin that all his efforts to remove it only
  increased his agonies.

  In this pitiable condition he was conveyed to Trachin, where
  Deianeira, on beholding the terrible suffering of which she was the
  innocent cause, was overcome with grief and remorse, and hanged herself
  in despair. The dying hero called his son Hyllus to his side, and desired
  him to make Iole his wife, and then ordering his followers to erect a
  funeral pyre, he mounted it and implored the by-standers to set fire to
  it, and thus in mercy to terminate his insufferable torments. But no one
  had the courage to obey him, until at last his friend and companion
  Philoctetes, yielding to his piteous appeal, lighted the pile, and
  received in return the bow and arrows of the hero.

  Soon flames on flames ascended, and amidst vivid flashes of lightning,
  accompanied by awful peals of thunder, Pallas-Athene descended in a
  cloud, and bore her favourite hero in a chariot to Olympus.

  Heracles became admitted among the immortals; and Hera, in token of
  her reconciliation, bestowed upon him the hand of her beautiful daughter
  Hebe, the goddess of eternal youth.

BELLEROPHON.

  Bellerophon, or Bellerophontes, was the son of Glaucus, king of
  Corinth, and grandson of Sisyphus. In consequence of an unpremeditated
  murder Bellerophon fled to Tiryns, where he was kindly received by King
  Pr       tus, who purified him from his crime. Antea, the wife of
  Pr       tus, was so charmed with the comely youth that she fell in love
  with him; but Bellerophon did not return her affection, and she, in
  revenge, slandered him to the king by a gross misrepresentation of the
  facts.  a
  name="page257">[257]

  The first impulse of Pr       tus, when informed of the conduct of
  Bellerophon, was to kill him; but the youth, with his gentle and winning
  manners, had so endeared himself to his host that he felt it impossible
  to take his life with his own hands. He therefore sent him to his
  father-in-law, Iobates, king of Lycia, with a kind of letter or tablet
  which contained mysterious signs, indicating his desire that the bearer
  of the missive should be put to death. But the gods watched over the true
  and loyal youth, and inclined the heart of Iobates, who was an amiable
  prince, towards his guest. Judging by his appearance that he was of noble
  birth, he entertained him, according to the hospitable custom of the
  Greeks, in the most princely manner for nine days, and not until the
  morning of the tenth did he inquire his name and errand.

  Bellerophon now presented to him the letter intrusted to him by
  Pr       tus. Iobates, who had become greatly attached to the youth, was
  horror-struck at its contents. Nevertheless he concluded that
  Pr       tus must have good reasons for his conduct, and that probably
  Bellerophon had committed a crime which deserved death. But as he could
  not make up his mind to murder the guest he had grown to esteem, he
  decided to despatch him upon dangerous enterprises, in which he would in
  all probability lose his life.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0257-1.png"
      alt="The Chimæra" title="The Chimæra" />
  
  He first sent him to kill the Chimæra, a monster which was at this
  time devastating the country. The fore part of its body was that of a
  lion, the centre of a goat, and the hind part of a dragon; whilst out of
  its jaws issued flames of fire.

  Before starting on this difficult task Bellerophon invoked the
  protection of the gods, and in answer to his prayer they despatched to
  his aid the immortal-winged horse Pegasus, the offspring of Poseidon and
  Medusa. But the divine animal would not suffer himself to be  !-- Page
  258 -->[258]caught,
  and at last, worn out with his fruitless exertions, Bellerophon fell into
  a deep sleep beside the sacred spring Pirene. Here Pallas-Athene appeared
  to him in a dream, and presented him with a magic bridle for the purpose
  of capturing the divine steed. On awaking Bellerophon instinctively put
  out his hand to grasp it, when, to his amazement, there lay beside him
  the bridle of his dream, whilst Pegasus was quietly drinking at the
  fountain close by. Seizing him by the mane Bellerophon threw the bridle
  over his head, and succeeded in mounting him without further difficulty;
  then rising with him into the air he slew the Chimæra with his
  arrows.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0258-1.png"
      alt="Bellerophon and Pegasus" title="Bellerophon and Pegasus" />
  
  Iobates next sent him on an expedition against the Solymans, a fierce
  neighbouring tribe with whom he was at enmity. Bellerophon succeeded in
  vanquishing them, and was then despatched against the much-dreaded
  Amazons; but greatly to the astonishment of Iobates the hero again
  returned victorious.

  Finally, Iobates placed a number of the bravest Lycians in ambush for
  the purpose of destroying him, but not one returned alive, for
  Bellerophon bravely defended himself and slew them all. Convinced at
  length that Bellerophon, far from deserving death, was the special
  favourite of the gods, who had evidently protected him throughout his
  perilous exploits, the king now ceased his persecutions.

  Iobates admitted him to a share in the government, and gave him his
  daughter in marriage. But Bellerophon having attained the summit of
  earthly prosperity became intoxicated with pride and vanity, and incurred
  the displeasure of the gods by endeavouring to mount to heaven on his
  winged horse, for the purpose of gratifying his idle curiosity. Zeus
  punished him for his impiety by sending  span
  class="pagenum">[259]a gadfly to sting the
  horse, who became so restive that he threw his rider, who was
  precipitated to the earth. Filled with remorse at having offended the
  gods Bellerophon fell a prey to the deepest melancholy, and wandered
  about for the remainder of his life in the loneliest and most desolate
  places.

  After death he was honoured in Corinth as a hero, and an altar was
  erected to him in the grove of Poseidon.

THESEUS.

  Aegeus, king of Athens, being twice married, and having no children,
  was so desirous of an heir to his throne that he made a pilgrimage to
  Delphi in order to consult the oracle. But the response being ambiguous,
  he repaired to Troezen to consult his wise friend Pittheus, who reigned
  over that city, by whose advice he contracted a secret marriage with his
  friend's daughter Aethra.

  After passing some time with his bride, Aegeus prepared to take his
  departure for his own dominions; but before doing so he led Aethra to the
  sea-shore, where, after depositing his sword and sandals under a huge
  rock, he thus addressed her: "Should the gods bless our union with a son,
  do not reveal to him the name and rank of his father until he is old
  enough to possess the strength requisite for moving this stone. Then send
  him to my palace at Athens bearing these tokens of his identity."

  A son was born to Aethra, whom she called Theseus, and who was
  carefully trained and educated by his grandfather Pittheus. When he had
  developed into a strong and manly youth his mother conducted him to the
  spot where the rock had been placed by Aegeus, and at her command he
  rolled away the stone, and took possession of the sword and sandals which
  had lain there for sixteen years, and which she now desired him to convey
  to his father Aegeus, king of Athens.

  His mother and grandfather were anxious that the youth should travel
  by the safe sea route, the road between Troezen and Athens being at this
  time infested  a
  name="page260">[260]with robbers of great ferocity and
  enormous strength. But feeling within himself the spirit of a hero,
  Theseus resolved to emulate the deeds of Heracles, with whose fame all
  Greece resounded, and therefore chose the more dangerous journey by land,
  as calculated to afford him an opportunity of distinguishing himself by
  feats of valour.

  His first adventure occurred at Epidaurus, where he met Periphetes, a
  son of Hephæstus, who was armed with an iron club, with which he killed
  all travellers. Having received from his grandfather a full description
  of this savage, Theseus at once recognized him, and rushing upon him with
  his sword, succeeded after a desperate encounter in killing him. He
  appropriated the club as a trophy of his victory, and proceeded on his
  journey without hinderance until he arrived at the Isthmus of
  Corinth.

  Here the people warned him to beware of Sinnis the robber, who forced
  all travellers to bend with him one of the branches of a tall pine-tree.
  Having dragged it to the ground, the cruel Sinnis suddenly released his
  hold, whereupon the bough rebounding high up into the air, the
  unfortunate victim was dashed to the ground and killed. When Theseus
  beheld Sinnis advancing towards him he steadily awaited his approach;
  then seizing his powerful club, he killed the inhuman wretch with one
  blow.

  Passing through the woody district of Crommyon Theseus next slew a
  wild and dangerous sow which had long ravaged the country.

  He then continued his journey and approached the borders of Megara,
  where, on a narrow path overhanging the sea, dwelt the wicked Scyron,
  another terror to travellers. It was his custom to compel all strangers
  who passed his abode to wash his feet, during which operation he kicked
  them over the rock into the sea. Theseus boldly attacked the giant,
  overcame him, and then flung his body over the cliff where so many of his
  victims had perished.

  Theseus now journeyed on to Eleusis, where he found  !-- Page 261
  -->[261]another
  adversary in the person of King Cercyon, who forced all comers to wrestle
  with him, and killed those whom he vanquished; but Theseus overcame the
  mighty wrestler and slew him.

  Near Eleusis, on the banks of the river Cephissus, Theseus met with a
  new adventure. Here lived the giant Damastes, called Procrustes or the
  Stretcher, who had two iron beds, one being long and the other short,
  into which he forced all strangers; In the short one he placed the tall
  men, whose limbs he cut to the size of the bed, whilst to the short ones
  he assigned the large bed, stretching them out to fit it; and thus he
  left his victims to expire in the most cruel torments. Theseus freed the
  country from this inhuman monster by serving him as he had done his
  unfortunate victims.

  The hero now continued his journey, and at length reached Athens
  without meeting with any further adventures. When he arrived at his
  destination he found his father a helpless tool in the hands of the
  sorceress Medea, whom he had married after her departure from Corinth.
  Knowing, by means of her supernatural powers, that Theseus was the king's
  son, and fearing that her influence might be weakened by his presence,
  she poisoned the mind of the old king against the stranger, whom she
  represented as being a spy. It was accordingly arranged that Theseus
  should be invited to a banquet, and a strong poison mixed with his
  wine.

  Now Theseus had resolved to reveal himself at this feast to the father
  whom he yearned to embrace. Before tasting the wine he put his plan into
  execution, and drew out his sword so that the eyes of the king might rest
  upon it. When Aegeus beheld once more the well-known weapon which he had
  so often wielded, he knew that it was his son who stood before him. He
  warmly embraced him, presented him as his heir to his courtiers and
  subjects, and then, no longer able to endure the sight of Medea, he
  banished her for ever from his dominions.

  When Theseus was acknowledged as the rightful heir to the throne he
  was opposed by the fifty sons of Pallas,  span
  class="pagenum">[262]the king's brother, who
  had confidently expected that on the demise of the old king the
  government of the country would devolve upon them. They therefore
  resolved to put Theseus to death; but their plans becoming known to him,
  he surprised them as they lay in ambush awaiting his approach, and
  destroyed them all.

  Fearing, however, lest the Athenians might entertain a prejudice
  against him on account of his extermination of their fellow-citizens, the
  Pallantids, Theseus resolved to perform some signal service for the
  state, which should gain for him the hearts of the people. He accordingly
  decided to rid the country of the famous bull of Marathon, which had
  become a terror to the cultivators of the land. He captured the animal
  and brought him in chains to Athens, where, after publicly exhibiting him
  to the astonished multitude, he solemnly sacrificed him to Apollo.

  The next enterprise undertaken by Theseus far surpassed all his other
  feats of heroic daring, and secured to him the universal admiration and
  gratitude of his fellow-citizens. This was the slaying of the Minotaur,
  which put an end for ever to the shameful tribute of seven youths and
  seven maidens which was exacted from the Athenians every nine years.

  The origin of this barbarous tribute was as follows: Androgeos, the
  youthful son of Minos, king of Crete, having been treacherously murdered
  by the Athenians, his father, anxious to avenge the death of his son,
  declared war against their king Aegeus, and conquered Athens and the
  villages in its vicinity. The conqueror henceforth compelled the
  Athenians to send to him every nine years a tribute of seven youths and
  seven maidens of the noblest families of the land, who became the prey of
  the Minotaur, a monster, half-man, half-bull, whose lair was in the
  wonderful labyrinth, constructed by Dædalus for the Cretan king.

  When Theseus informed his father of his heroic determination, he was
  overwhelmed with grief, and endeavoured, by every means in his power, to
  shake his son's resolution, but, confident of success, Theseus assured
  his  a
  name="page263">[263]father that he would slay the Minotaur and
  return home victorious.

  It was customary for the vessel bearing its unhappy freight of human
  victims to use on this voyage black sails only; but Theseus promised his
  father that, should he return in safety, he would hoist white ones in
  their place.

  Before leaving Athens Theseus, by the advice of an oracle, chose
  Aphrodite as his guardian and protectress, and accordingly offered up a
  sacrifice to her. When he arrived in the presence of king Minos, the
  goddess of Love inspired Ariadne, the beautiful daughter of the king,
  with an ardent attachment for the noble young hero. During a secret
  interview, in which a mutual confession of affection took place, Ariadne
  furnished him with a sharp sword and a clue of thread, the end of which
  she desired him to fasten at the entrance to the labyrinth and to
  continue to unwind it till he reached the lair of the Minotaur. Full of
  hope as to the successful issue of his undertaking, Theseus took leave of
  the kind maiden, after expressing his gratitude for her timely aid.

  At the head of his companions he was now conducted by Minos to the
  entrance of the labyrinth. Strictly adhering to the injunctions of the
  fair Ariadne he succeeded in finding the Minotaur, whom, after a fierce
  and violent struggle, he defeated and killed; then carefully feeling his
  way, by means of the clue of thread, he led his companions safely out of
  the labyrinth. They then fled to their ship, taking with them the lovely
  maiden to whose affection for their deliverer they owed their safety.

  Arrived at the island of Naxos, Theseus had a dream, in which
  Dionysus, the wine-god, appeared to him, and informed him that the Fates
  had decreed that Ariadne should be his bride, at the same time menacing
  the hero with all kinds of misfortunes should he refuse to resign her.
  Now Theseus, having been taught from his youth to reverence the gods,
  feared to disobey the wishes of Dionysus. He accordingly took a sad
  farewell of the  a
  name="page264">[264]beautiful maiden who so tenderly loved
  him, and left her on the lonely island, where she was found and wooed by
  the wine-god.

  Theseus and his companions felt keenly the loss of their benefactress,
  and in their grief at parting with her, forgot that the ship still bore
  the black sails with which she had left the Attic coast. As she neared
  the port of Athens, Aegeus, who was anxiously awaiting the return of his
  son on the beach, caught sight of the vessel with its black sails, and
  concluding that his gallant son had perished, threw himself in despair
  into the sea.

  With the unanimous approval of the Athenians, Theseus now ascended the
  vacant throne, and soon proved himself to be not only a valiant hero but
  also a wise prince and prudent legislator. Athens was at this time but a
  small city surrounded by a number of villages, each of which possessed
  its own separate form of government; but by means of kind and
  conciliatory measures Theseus induced the heads of these different
  communities to resign their sovereignty, and to intrust the
  administration of public affairs to a court which should sit constantly
  at Athens, and exercise jurisdiction over all the inhabitants of Attica.
  The result of these judicious measures was, that the Athenians became a
  united and powerful people, and that numbers of strangers and foreigners
  flocked to Athens, which became a flourishing maritime port and a
  commercial centre of great importance.

  Theseus renewed the Isthmian Games, and also instituted numerous
  festivals, the principal of which was the Panathenæa, held in honour of
  Athene-Polias.

  It is related that Theseus upon one occasion arrived during a voyage
  at the Amazonian coast. Anxious to ascertain the object of his visit, the
  Amazons sent Hippolyte, one of their number, with presents to the
  stranger; but no sooner did the fair herald set foot on board his vessel
  than Theseus set sail and carried her off to Athens, where he made her
  his queen. Enraged at this indignity the Amazons determined to be
  revenged. Some time afterwards, when the whole affair would  !-- Page 265
  -->[265]appear to have
  been forgotten, they seized the opportunity when the city of Athens was
  in a defenceless condition and landed an army in Attica. So sudden was
  their attack that they had penetrated into the very heart of the city
  before the Athenians could organize their forces; but Theseus
  expeditiously collected his troops and commenced such a furious onslaught
  upon the invaders that, after a desperate encounter, they were driven
  from the city. Peace was then concluded, whereupon the Amazons evacuated
  the country. During this engagement Hippolyte, forgetful of her origin,
  fought valiantly by the side of her husband against her own kinsfolk, and
  perished on the field of battle.

  
       img style="width:100%" src="images/0265-1.png"
      alt="Hippolyte" title="Hippolyte" />
  
  It was soon after this sad event that Theseus joined the
  world-renowned Calydonian Boar-hunt, in which he took a leading part. He
  also formed one of the brave band who shared in the perils of the
  Argonautic expedition.

  The remarkable friendship which existed between Theseus and Pirithöus
  originated under such peculiar circumstances that it is worthy of
  mention.

  Hearing upon one occasion that his herds, pasturing in the plains of
  Marathon, had been carried off by Pirithöus, Theseus collected together
  an armed force and sallied forth to punish the plunderer. But, when the
  two heroes met face to face, both were seized with an impulse of
  sympathetic admiration for each other. Pirithöus, holding out his hand in
  token of peace, exclaimed, "What satisfaction shall I render thee, oh
  Theseus? Be thou thyself the judge." Theseus seized the proffered hand
  and replied, "I ask nought save thy  span
  class="pagenum">[266]friendship;" whereupon
  the heroes embraced each other and swore eternal fidelity.

  When, soon afterwards, Pirithöus became united to Hippodamia, a
  Thessalian princess, he invited Theseus to the wedding-feast, which was
  also attended, among other guests, by a large number of Centaurs, who
  were friends of Pirithöus. Towards the end of the banquet Eurytion, a
  young Centaur, heated and flushed with wine, seized the lovely bride and
  sought by force to carry her off. The other Centaurs, following his
  example, each endeavoured to capture a maiden. Pirithöus and his
  followers, aided by Theseus, who rendered most valuable assistance,
  attacked the Centaurs, and after a violent hand-to-hand struggle in which
  many perished, forced them to relinquish their prey.

  After the death of Hippolyte Theseus sought the hand of Phædra, the
  sister of his former bride Ariadne, to whom he became united. For some
  years they lived happily together, and their union was blessed by the
  birth of two sons. During this time Hippolytus, the son of the Amazonian
  queen, had been absent from home, having been placed under the care of
  the king's uncles in order to be educated. When, having grown to manhood,
  he now returned to his father's palace, his young stepmother, Phædra,
  fell violently in love with him; but Hippolytus failed to return her
  affection, and treated her with contempt and indifference. Filled with
  rage and despair at his coldness Phædra put an end to her existence; and
  when she was discovered by her husband she held in her hand a letter,
  accusing Hippolytus of being the cause of her death, and of having
  conspired against the honour of the king.

  Now Poseidon had upon one occasion promised to grant Theseus whatever
  request he should demand; he therefore called upon the sea-god to destroy
  Hippolytus, whom he cursed in the most solemn manner. The father's awful
  malediction fell but too soon upon his innocent son; for, as the latter
  was driving his chariot along the sea-shore, between Troezen and Athens,
  a  a
  name="page267">[267]monster, sent by Poseidon, rose out of the
  deep, and so frightened the horses that they became altogether
  unmanageable. As they rushed on in their mad career the chariot was
  dashed to pieces, and the unfortunate youth, whose feet had become
  entangled in the reins, was dragged along until life was nearly
  extinct.

  In this condition he was found by the unhappy Theseus, who, having
  ascertained the true facts of the case from an old servant of Phædra, had
  hastened to prevent the catastrophe. But he arrived too late, and was
  only able to soothe the last moments of his dying son by acknowledging
  the sad mistake which he had committed, and declaring his firm belief in
  his honour and innocence.

  After these events Theseus was persuaded by his friend Pirithöus, who
  had also about this time lost his young wife, Hippodamia, to join him in
  a journey through Greece, with the object of carrying off by force the
  most beautiful maidens whom they should chance to meet.

  Arrived at Sparta they beheld, in the temple of Artemis, Helen, the
  daughter of Zeus and Leda, who was engaged in performing sacred dances in
  honour of the goddess. Although the maiden was only nine years old the
  fame of her beauty, which was destined to play so important a part in the
  history of Greece, had already spread far and wide. Theseus and Pirithöus
  forcibly abducted her, and then having cast lots for her, she fell to
  Theseus, who placed her under the charge of his mother Æthra.

  Pirithöus now requested Theseus to assist him in his ambitious scheme
  of descending to the lower world and carrying off Persephone, the queen
  of Hades. Though fully alive to the perils of the undertaking Theseus
  would not forsake his friend, and together they sought the gloomy realm
  of Shades. But Aïdes had been forewarned of their approach, and scarcely
  had the two friends set foot within his dominions when, by his orders,
  they were seized, bound with chains, and secured to an enchanted rock at
  the entrance of Hades. Here the two  span
  class="pagenum">[268]friends languished for
  many years, until Heracles passed by in his search for Cerberus, when he
  released Theseus; but in obedience to an injunction of the gods, left
  Pirithöus to endure for ever the punishment of his too daring
  ambition.

  While Theseus was imprisoned in the under world Castor and Pollux, the
  brothers of Helen, invaded Athens, and demanded the restoration of their
  young sister. Seeing his country threatened with the horrors of warfare,
  an Athenian citizen named Academus, who knew of Helen's place of
  concealment, repaired to the camp of the Dioscuri, and informed them
  where they would find her. Æthra at once resigned her charge, whereupon
  the brothers took leave of Athens, and, accompanied by Helen, returned to
  their native country.

  But the prolonged absence of Theseus gave rise to other troubles of a
  more serious character. Thinking the opportunity favourable for a revolt,
  a faction, headed by Menesthius, a descendant of Erechtheus, arrogated to
  themselves supreme power, and seized the reins of government.

  Returned to Athens, Theseus at once took active measures to quell the
  insubordination which existed on all sides. He expelled Menesthius from
  office, rigorously punished the ringleaders of the revolt, and placed
  himself once more upon the throne. But his hold upon the people was gone.
  His former services were all forgotten, and, finding at length that
  dissensions and revolts were rife, he voluntarily abdicated the throne,
  and retired to his estates in the island of Scyros. Here Lycomedes, king
  of the island, feigned to receive him with the utmost friendship; but
  being, as it is supposed, in league with Menesthius, he led the old king
  to the summit of a high rock, under pretence of showing him his estates,
  and treacherously killed him by pushing him over the cliff.

  Many centuries after his death, by the command of the oracle of
  Delphi, Cimon, the father of Miltiades, at the conclusion of the Persian
  war, brought the remains of Theseus, the great benefactor of Athens, to
  that city,  a
  name="page269">[269]and in his honour a temple was erected,
  which exists to the present day, and serves as a museum of art.

       DIPUS.

  Laius, king of Thebes, the son of Labdacus, and a direct descendant of
  Cadmus, was married to Jocaste, the daughter of a noble Theban. An oracle
  having foretold that he would perish by the hand of his own son, he
  determined to destroy the infant to whom Jocaste had just given birth.
  With the consent of his wife, whose affection for her husband overcame
  her love for her child, he pierced the feet of the babe, bound them
  together, and handed the infant over to a servant, with instructions to
  expose him on Mount Cithæron to perish. But instead of obeying this cruel
  command, the servant intrusted him to a shepherd who was tending the
  flocks of Polybus, king of Corinth, and then returned to Laius and
  Jocaste, and informed them that their orders had been obeyed. The parents
  were satisfied with the intelligence, and quieted their conscience by the
  reflection that they had thus prevented their son from committing the
  crime of parricide.

  Meanwhile the shepherd of king Polybus had unbound the feet of the
  infant, and in consequence of their being much swollen he called him
         dipus, or Swollen-foot. He then carried him to the king, his
  master, who, pitying the poor little waif, enlisted for him the kind
  offices of his wife, Merope.        dipus was adopted by the king and
  queen as their own son, and grew up in the belief that they were his
  parents, until one day a Corinthian noble taunted him at a banquet with
  not being the son of the king. Stung at this reproach the youth appealed
  to Merope, but receiving an equivocal, though kindly answer, he repaired
  to Delphi to consult the oracle. The Pythia vouchsafed no reply to his
  inquiry, but informed him, to his horror, that he was fated to kill his
  father and to marry his own mother.

  Filled with dismay, for he was tenderly attached to Polybus and
  Merope,        dipus determined not to return  span
  class="pagenum">[270]to Corinth, and took
  instead the road leading to B       otia. On his way a chariot passed
  him, in which sat an old man with two servants, who rudely pushed the
  pedestrian out of the path. In the scuffle which ensued        dipus
  struck the old man with his heavy stick, and he fell back dead on the
  seat of the chariot. Struck with dismay at the unpremeditated murder
  which he had committed, the youth fled, and left the spot without
  learning that the old man whom he had killed was his father, Laius, king
  of Thebes.

  Not long after this occurrence the Sphinx (full details of whom have
  already been given) was sent by the goddess Hera as a punishment to the
  Thebans. Stationed on a rocky height just outside the city, she
  propounded to the passers by riddles which she had been taught by the
  Muses, and whoever failed to solve them was torn in pieces and devoured
  by the monster, and in this manner great numbers of the inhabitants of
  Thebes had perished.

  Now on the death of the old king Laius, Creon, the brother of the
  widowed queen, had seized the reins of government and mounted the vacant
  throne; and when at length his own son fell a victim to the Sphinx, he
  resolved at all costs to rid the country of this fearful scourge. He
  accordingly issued a proclamation, that the kingdom and the hand of his
  sister Jocaste should be awarded to him who should succeed in solving one
  of the riddles of the Sphinx, it having been foretold by an oracle that
  only then would the country be freed from the monster.

  Just as this proclamation was being made in the streets of Thebes
         dipus, with his pilgrim's staff in his hand, entered the city.
  Tempted by the prospect of so magnificent a reward he repaired to the
  rock, and boldly requested the Sphinx to propound to him one of her
  riddles. She proposed to him one which she deemed impossible of solution,
  but        dipus at once solved it; whereupon the Sphinx, full of rage
  and despair, precipitated herself into the abyss and perished.
         dipus  a
  name="page271">[271]received the promised reward. He became
  king of Thebes and the husband of Jocaste, the widow of his father, king
  Laius.

  For many years        dipus enjoyed the greatest happiness and
  tranquillity. Four children were born to him       two sons, Eteocles and
  Polynices, and two daughters, Antigone and Ismene. But at last the gods
  afflicted the country with a grievous pestilence, which made terrible
  havoc among the people. In their distress they entreated the help of the
  king, who was regarded by his subjects as a special favourite of the
  gods.        dipus consulted an oracle, and the response was that the
  pestilence would continue to rage until the land was purified of the
  blood of king Laius, whose murderer was living unpunished at Thebes.

  The king now invoked the most solemn imprecations on the head of the
  murderer, and offered a reward for any information concerning him. He
  then sent for the blind old seer Tiresias, and implored him, by means of
  his prophetic powers, to reveal to him the author of the crime. Tiresias
  at first hesitated, but yielding to the earnest solicitations of the
  king, the old prophet thus addressed him: "Thou thyself art the murderer
  of the old king Laius, who was thy father; and thou art wedded to his
  widow, thine own mother." In order to convince        dipus of the truth
  of his words, he brought forward the old servant who had exposed him as a
  babe on Mount Cithæron, and the shepherd who had conveyed him to king
  Polybus. Horrified at this awful revelation        dipus, in a fit of
  despair, deprived himself of sight, and the unfortunate Jocaste, unable
  to survive her disgrace, hanged herself.

  Accompanied by his faithful and devoted daughter Antigone,
         dipus quitted Thebes and became a miserable and homeless outcast,
  begging his bread from place to place. At length, after a long and
  painful pilgrimage, he found a place of refuge in the grove of the
  Eumenides (at Colonus, near Athens), where his last moments were soothed
  and tended by the care and devotion of the faithful Antigone.

[272]

THE SEVEN AGAINST THEBES.

  After the voluntary abdication of        dipus, his two sons, Eteocles
  and Polynices, took possession of the crown and reigned over the city of
  Thebes. But Eteocles, being an ambitious prince, soon seized the reins of
  government himself, and expelled his brother from the throne.

  Polynices now repaired to Argos, where he arrived in the dead of
  night. Outside the gates of the royal palace he encountered Tydeus, the
  son of        neus, king of Calydon. Having accidentally killed a
  relative in the chase, Tydeus was also a fugitive; but being mistaken by
  Polynices in the darkness for an enemy, a quarrel ensued, which might
  have ended fatally, had not king Adrastus, aroused by the clamour,
  appeared on the scene and parted the combatants.

  By the light of the torches borne by his attendants Adrastus observed,
  to his surprise, that on the shield of Polynices a lion was depicted, and
  on that of Tydeus a boar. The former bore this insignia in honour of the
  renowned hero Heracles, the latter in memory of the famous Calydonian
  boar-hunt. This circumstance reminded the king of an extraordinary
  oracular prediction concerning his two beautiful daughters, Argia and
  Deipyle, which was to the effect that he would give them in marriage to a
  lion and a boar. Hailing with delight what he regarded as an auspicious
  solution of the mysterious prophecy, he invited the strangers into his
  palace; and when he heard their history, and had convinced himself that
  they were of noble birth, he bestowed upon Polynices his beautiful
  daughter Argia, and upon Tydeus the fair Deipyle, promising at the same
  time that he would assist both his sons-in-law to regain their rightful
  patrimony.

  The first care of Adrastus was to aid Polynices in regaining
  possession of his lawful share in the government of Thebes. He
  accordingly invited the most powerful chiefs in his kingdom to join in
  the expedition,  a
  name="page273">[273]all of whom readily obeyed the call with
  the exception of the king's brother-in-law, Amphiaraus, the seer. As he
  foresaw a disastrous termination to the enterprise, and knew that not one
  of the heroes, save Adrastus himself, would return alive, he earnestly
  dissuaded the king from carrying out his project, and declined to take
  any part in the undertaking. But Adrastus, seconded by Polynices and
  Tydeus, was obstinately bent on the achievement of his purpose, and
  Amphiaraus, in order to escape from their importunities, concealed
  himself in a hiding-place known only to his wife Eriphyle.

  Now on the occasion of the marriage of Amphiaraus it had been agreed,
  that if he ever differed in opinion with the king, his wife should decide
  the question. As the presence of Amphiaraus was indispensable to the
  success of the undertaking, and, moreover, as Adrastus would not enter
  upon it without "the eye of the army," as he called his brother-in-law,
  Polynices, bent on securing his services, determined to bribe Eriphyle to
  use her influence with her husband and to decide the question in
  accordance with his wishes. He bethought himself of the beautiful
  necklace of Harmonia, wife of Cadmus, which he had brought with him in
  his flight from Thebes. Without loss of time he presented himself before
  the wife of Amphiaraus, and held up to her admiring gaze the glittering
  bauble, promising that if she revealed the hiding-place of her husband
  and induced him to join the expedition, the necklace should be hers.
  Eriphyle, unable to withstand the tempting bait, accepted the bribe, and
  thus Amphiaraus was compelled to join the army. But before leaving his
  home he extorted a solemn promise from his son Alcmæon that, should he
  perish on the field of battle, he would avenge his death on his mother,
  the perfidious Eriphyle.

  Seven leaders were now chosen, each at the head of a separate
  detachment of troops. These were Adrastus the king, his two brothers
  Hippomedon and Parthenopæus, Capaneus his nephew, Polynices and Tydeus,
  and Amphiaraus.

[274]

  When the army was collected they set out for Nemea, which was at this
  time governed by king Lycurgus. Here the Argives, being short of water,
  halted on the outskirts of a forest in order to search for a spring, when
  they saw a majestic and beautiful woman seated on the trunk of a tree,
  nursing an infant. They concluded from her noble and queenly appearance
  that she must be a goddess, but were informed by her that she was
  Hypsipile, queen of the Lemnians, who had been carried away captive by
  pirates, and sold as a slave to king Lycurgus, and that she was now
  acting as nurse to his infant son. When the warriors told her that they
  were in search of water, she laid the child down in the grass, and led
  them to a secret spring in the forest, with which she alone was
  acquainted. But on their return they found, to their grief, that the
  unfortunate babe had been killed during their absence, by a serpent. They
  slew the reptile, and then collecting the remains of the infant, they
  buried them with funereal honours and proceeded on their way.

  The warlike host now appeared before the walls of Thebes, and each
  leader placed himself before one of the seven gates of the city in
  readiness for the attack. Eteocles, in conjunction with Creon, had made
  due preparations to repel the invaders, and had stationed troops, under
  the command of trusty leaders, to guard each of the gates. Then,
  according to the practice of the ancients of consulting soothsayers
  before entering upon any undertaking, the blind old seer Tiresias was
  sent for, who, after carefully taking the auguries from the flight of
  birds, declared that all efforts to defend the city would prove
  unavailing, unless the youngest descendant of the house of Cadmus would
  offer himself as a voluntary sacrifice for the good of the state.

  When Creon heard the words of the seer his first thought was of his
  favourite son Men       ceus, the youngest scion of the royal house, who
  was present at the interview. He therefore earnestly implored him to
  leave the city, and to repair for safety to Delphi. But the gallant youth
  heroically resolved to sacrifice his life for the  span
  class="pagenum">[275]benefit of his country,
  and after taking leave of his old father, mounted the city walls, and
  plunging a dagger into his heart, perished in the sight of the contending
  hosts.

  Adrastus now gave his troops the word of command to storm the city,
  and they rushed forward to the attack with great valour. The battle raged
  long and furiously, and after heavy losses on both sides the Argives were
  routed and put to flight.

  After the lapse of some days they reorganized their forces, and again
  appeared before the gates of Thebes, when Eteocles, grieved to think that
  there should be such a terrible loss of life on his account, sent a
  herald into the opposite camp, with a proposition that the fate of the
  campaign should be decided by single combat between himself and his
  brother Polynices. The challenge was readily accepted, and in the duel
  which took place outside the city walls, in the sight of the rival
  forces, Eteocles and Polynices were both fatally wounded and expired on
  the field of battle.

  Both sides now claimed the day, and the result was that hostilities
  recommenced, and soon the battle raged with greater fury than ever. But
  victory at last declared itself for the Thebans. In their flight the
  Argives lost all their leaders, Adrastus excepted, who owed his safety to
  the fleetness of his horse Arion.

  By the death of the brothers, Creon became once more king of Thebes,
  and in order to show his abhorrence of the conduct of Polynices in
  fighting against his country, he strictly forbade any one to bury either
  his remains or those of his allies. But the faithful Antigone, who had
  returned to Thebes on the death of her father, could not endure that the
  body of her brother should remain unburied. She therefore bravely
  disregarded the orders of the king, and endeavoured to give sepulture to
  the remains of Polynices.

  When Creon discovered that his commands had been set at defiance, he
  inhumanly condemned the devoted maiden to be entombed alive in a
  subterranean vault.  a
  name="page276">[276]But retribution was at hand. His son,
  Hæmon, who was betrothed to Antigone, having contrived to effect an
  entrance into the vault, was horrified to find that Antigone had hanged
  herself by her veil. Feeling that life without her would be intolerable,
  he threw himself in despair on his own sword, and after solemnly invoking
  the malediction of the gods on the head of his father, expired beside the
  dead body of his betrothed.

  Hardly had the news of the tragic fate of his son reached the king,
  before another messenger appeared, bearing the tidings that his wife
  Eurydice, on hearing of the death of Hæmon, had put an end to her
  existence, and thus the king found himself in his old age both widowed
  and childless.

  Nor did he succeed in the execution of his vindictive designs; for
  Adrastus, who, after his flight from Thebes, had taken refuge at Athens,
  induced Theseus to lead an army against the Thebans, to compel them to
  restore the dead bodies of the Argive warriors to their friends, in order
  that they might perform due funereal rites in honour of the slain. This
  undertaking was successfully accomplished, and the remains of the fallen
  heroes were interred with due honours.

THE EPIGONI.

  Ten years after these events the sons of the slain heroes, who were
  called Epigoni, or descendants, resolved to avenge the death of their
  fathers, and with this object entered upon a new expedition against the
  city of Thebes.

  By the advice of the Delphic oracle the command was intrusted to
  Alcmæon, the son of Amphiaraus; but remembering the injunction of his
  father he hesitated to accept this post before executing vengeance on his
  mother Eriphyle. Thersander, however, the son of Polynices, adopting
  similar tactics to those of his father, bribed Eriphyle with the
  beautiful veil of Harmonia, bequeathed to him by Polynices, to induce her
  son  a
  name="page277">[277]Alcmæon and his brother Amphilochus to
  join in this second war against Thebes.

  Now the mother of Alcmæon was gifted with that rare fascination which
  renders its possessor irresistible to all who may chance to come within
  its influence; nor was her own son able to withstand her blandishments.
  Yielding therefore to her wily representations he accepted the command of
  the troops, and at the head of a large and powerful army advanced upon
  Thebes.

  Before the gates of the city Alcmæon encountered the Thebans under the
  command of Laodamas, the son of Eteocles. A fierce battle ensued, in
  which the Theban leader, after performing prodigies of valour, perished
  by the hand of Alcmæon.

  After losing their chief and the flower of their army, the Thebans
  retreated behind the city walls, and the enemy now pressed them hard on
  every side. In their distress they appealed to the blind old seer
  Tiresias, who was over a hundred years old. With trembling lips and in
  broken accents, he informed them that they could only save their lives by
  abandoning their native city with their wives and families. Upon this
  they despatched ambassadors into the enemy's camp; and whilst these were
  protracting negotiations during the night, the Thebans, with their wives
  and children, evacuated the city. Next morning the Argives entered Thebes
  and plundered it, placing Thersander, the son of Polynices (who was a
  descendant of Cadmus), on the throne which his father had so vainly
  contested.

ALCMÆON AND THE NECKLACE.

  When Alcmæon returned from his expedition against the Thebans he
  determined to fulfil the last injunction of his father Amphiaraus, who
  had desired him to be revenged on his mother Eriphyle for her perfidy in
  accepting a bribe to betray him. This resolution was further strengthened
  by the discovery that his unprincipled mother had urged him also to join
  the expedition  a
  name="page278">[278]in return for the much-coveted veil of
  Harmonia. He therefore put her to death; and taking with him the
  ill-fated necklace and veil, abandoned for ever the home of his
  fathers.

  But the gods, who could not suffer so unnatural a crime to go
  unpunished, afflicted him with madness, and sent one of the Furies to
  pursue him unceasingly. In this unhappy condition he wandered about from
  place to place, until at last having reached Psophis in Arcadia, Phegeus,
  king of the country, not only purified him of his crime, but also
  bestowed upon him the hand of his daughter Arsinoë, to whom Alcmæon
  presented the necklace and veil, which had already been the cause of so
  much unhappiness.

  Though now released from his mental affliction, the curse which hung
  over him was not entirely removed, and on his account the country of his
  adoption was visited with a severe drought. On consulting the oracle of
  Delphi he was informed that any land which offered him shelter would be
  cursed by the gods, and that the malediction would continue to follow him
  till he came to a country which was not in existence at the time he had
  murdered his mother. Bereft of hope, and resolved no longer to cast the
  shadow of his dark fate over those he loved, Alcmæon took a tender leave
  of his wife and little son, and became once more an outcast and
  wanderer.

  Arrived after a long and painful pilgrimage at the river Achelous, he
  discovered, to his unspeakable joy, a beautiful and fertile island, which
  had but lately emerged from beneath the water. Here he took up his abode;
  and in this haven of rest he was at length freed from his sufferings, and
  finally purified of his crime by the river-god Achelous. But in his
  new-found home where prosperity smiled upon him, Alcmæon soon forgot the
  loving wife and child he had left behind, and wooed Calirrhoë, the
  beautiful daughter of the river-god, who became united to him in
  marriage.

  For many years Alcmæon and Calirrhoë lived happily together, and two
  sons were born to them. But  a
  name="page279">[279]unfortunately for the peace of her
  husband, the daughter of Achelous had heard of the celebrated necklace
  and veil of Harmonia, and became seized with a violent desire to become
  the possessor of these precious treasures.

  Now the necklace and veil were in the safe-keeping of Arsinoë; but as
  Alcmæon had carefully concealed the fact of his former marriage from his
  young wife, he informed her, when no longer able to combat her
  importunities, that he had concealed them in a cave in his native
  country, and promised to hasten thither and procure them for her. He
  accordingly took leave of Calirrhoë and his children, and proceeded to
  Psophis, where he presented himself before his deserted wife and her
  father, king Phegeus. To them he excused his absence by the fact of his
  having suffered from a fresh attack of madness, and added that an oracle
  had foretold to him that his malady would only be cured when he had
  deposited the necklace and veil of Harmonia in the temple of Apollo at
  Delphi. Arsinoë, deceived by his artful representations, unhesitatingly
  restored to him his bridal gifts, whereupon Alcmæon set out on his
  homeward journey, well satisfied with the successful issue of his
  expedition.

  But the fatal necklace and veil were doomed to bring ruin and disaster
  to all who possessed them. During his sojourn at the court of king
  Phegeus, one of the servants who had accompanied Alcmæon betrayed the
  secret of his union with the daughter of the river-god; and when the king
  informed his sons of his treacherous conduct, they determined to avenge
  the wrongs of their sister Arsinoë. They accordingly concealed themselves
  at a point of the road which Alcmæon was compelled to pass, and as he
  neared the spot they suddenly emerged from their place of ambush, fell
  upon him and despatched him.

  When Arsinoë, who still loved her faithless husband, heard of the
  murder, she bitterly reproached her brothers for the crime which they had
  perpetrated, at which they were so incensed, that they placed her in a
  chest, and conveyed her to Agapenor, son of Ancæus, at Tegea.  !-- Page
  280 -->[280]Here they
  accused her of the murder of which they themselves were guilty, and she
  suffered a painful death.

  Calirrhoë, on learning the sad fate of Alcmæon, implored Zeus that her
  infant sons might grow at once to manhood, and avenge the death of their
  father. The ruler of Olympus heard the petition of the bereaved wife,
  and, in answer to her prayer, the children of yesterday became
  transformed into bearded men, full of strength and courage, and thirsting
  for revenge.

  Hastening to Tegea, they there encountered the sons of Phegeus, who
  were about to repair to Delphi, in order to deposit the necklace and veil
  in the sanctuary of Apollo; and before the brothers had time to defend
  themselves, the stalwart sons of Calirrhoë rushed upon them and slew
  them. They then proceeded to Psophis, where they killed king Phegeus and
  his wife, after which they returned to their mother with the necklace and
  veil, which, by the command of her father Achelous, were deposited as
  sacred offerings in the temple of Apollo at Delphi.

THE HERACLIDÆ.

  After the apotheosis of Heracles, his children were so cruelly
  persecuted by Eurystheus, that they fled for protection to king Ceyx at
  Trachin, accompanied by the aged Iolaus, the nephew and life-long friend
  of their father, who constituted himself their guide and protector. But
  on Eurystheus demanding the surrender of the fugitives, the Heraclidæ,
  knowing that the small force at the disposal of king Ceyx would be
  altogether inadequate to protect them against the powerful king of Argos,
  abandoned his territory, and sought refuge at Athens, where they were
  hospitably received by king Demophoon, the son of the great hero Theseus.
  He warmly espoused their cause, and determined to protect them at all
  costs against Eurystheus, who had despatched a numerous force in pursuit
  of them.

  When the Athenians had made all necessary preparations to repel the
  invaders, an oracle announced that the  span
  class="pagenum">[281]sacrifice of a maiden
  of noble birth was necessary to ensure to them victory; whereupon
  Macaria, the beautiful daughter of Heracles and Deianira, magnanimously
  offered herself as a sacrifice, and, surrounded by the noblest matrons
  and maidens of Athens, voluntarily devoted herself to death.

  While these events were transpiring in Athens, Hyllus, the eldest son
  of Heracles and Deianira, had advanced with a large army to the
  assistance of his brothers, and having sent a messenger to the king
  announcing his arrival, Demophoon, with his army, joined his forces.

  In the thick of the battle which ensued, Iolaus, following a sudden
  impulse, borrowed the chariot of Hyllus, and earnestly entreated Zeus and
  Hebe to restore to him, for this one day only, the vigour and strength of
  his youth. His prayer was heard. A thick cloud descended from heaven and
  enveloped the chariot, and when it disappeared, Iolaus, in the full
  plenitude of manly vigour, stood revealed before the astonished gaze of
  the combatants. He then led on his valiant band of warriors, and soon the
  enemy was in headlong flight; and Eurystheus, who was taken prisoner, was
  put to death by the command of king Demophoon.

  After gratefully acknowledging the timely aid of the Athenians,
  Hyllus, accompanied by the faithful Iolaus and his brothers, took leave
  of king Demophoon, and proceeded to invade the Peloponnesus, which they
  regarded as their lawful patrimony; for, according to the will of Zeus,
  it should have been the rightful possession of their father, the great
  hero Heracles, had not Hera maliciously defeated his plans by causing his
  cousin Eurystheus to precede him into the world.

  For the space of twelve months the Heraclidæ contrived to maintain
  themselves in the Peloponnesus; but at the expiration of that time a
  pestilence broke out, which spread over the entire peninsula, and
  compelled the Heraclidæ to evacuate the country and return to Attica,
  where for a time they settled.

  After the lapse of three years Hyllus resolved on  !-- Page 282
  -->[282]making another
  effort to obtain his paternal inheritance. Before setting out on the
  expedition, however, he consulted the oracle of Delphi, and the response
  was, that he must wait for the third fruit before the enterprise would
  prove successful. Interpreting this ambiguous reply to signify the third
  summer, Hyllus controlled his impatience for three years, when, having
  collected a powerful army, he once more entered the Peloponnesus.

  At the isthmus of Corinth he was opposed by Atreus, the son of Pelops,
  who at the death of Eurystheus had inherited the kingdom. In order to
  save bloodshed, Hyllus offered to decide his claims by single combat, the
  conditions being, that if he were victorious, he and his brothers should
  obtain undisputed possession of their rights; but if defeated, the
  Heraclidæ were to desist for fifty years from attempting to press their
  claim.

  The challenge was accepted by Echemon, king of Tegea, and Hyllus lost
  his life in the encounter, whereupon the sons of Heracles, in virtue of
  their agreement, abandoned the Peloponnesus and retired to Marathon.

  Hyllus was succeeded by his son Cleodæus, who, at the expiration of
  the appointed time, collected a large army and invaded the Peloponnesus;
  but he was not more successful than his father had been, and perished
  there with all his forces.

  Twenty years later his son Aristomachus consulted an oracle, which
  promised him victory if he went by way of the defile. The Heraclidæ once
  more set out, but were again defeated, and Aristomachus shared the fate
  of his father and grandfather, and fell on the field of battle.

  When, at the expiration of thirty years, the sons of Aristomachus,
  Temenus, Cresphontes, and Aristodemus again consulted the oracle, the
  answer was still the same; but this time the following explanation
  accompanied the response: the third fruit signified the third generation,
  to which they themselves belonged, and not the third fruit of the earth;
  and by the defile was indicated, not the isthmus of Corinth, but the
  straits on the right of the isthmus.

[283]

  Temenus lost no time in collecting an army and building ships of war;
  but just as all was ready and the fleet about to sail, Aristodemus, the
  youngest of the brothers, was struck by lightning. To add to their
  misfortunes, Hippolytes, a descendant of Heracles, who had joined in the
  expedition, killed a soothsayer whom he mistook for a spy, and the gods,
  in their displeasure, sent violent tempests, by means of which the entire
  fleet was destroyed, whilst famine and pestilence decimated the ranks of
  the army.

  The oracle, on being again consulted, advised that Hippolytes, being
  the offender, should be banished from the country for ten years, and that
  the command of the troops should be delegated to a man having three eyes.
  A search was at once instituted by the Heraclidæ for a man answering to
  this description, who was found at length in the person of Oxylus, a
  descendant of the Ætolian race of kings. In obedience to the command of
  the oracle, Hippolytes was banished, an army and fleet once more
  equipped, and Oxylus elected commander-in-chief.

  And now success at length crowned the efforts of the long-suffering
  descendants of the great hero. They obtained possession of the
  Peloponnesus, which was divided among them by lot. Argos fell to Temenus,
  Lacedæmon to Aristodemus, and Messene to Cresphontes. In gratitude for
  the services of their able leader, Oxylus, the kingdom of Elis, was
  conferred upon him by the Heraclidæ.

THE SIEGE OF TROY.

  Troy or Ilion was the capital of a kingdom in Asia Minor, situated
  near the Hellespont, and founded by Ilus, son of Tros. At the time of the
  famous Trojan war this city was under the government of Priam, a direct
  descendant of Ilus. Priam was married to Hecuba, daughter of Dymas, king
  of Thrace; and among the most celebrated of their children were the
  renowned and  a
  name="page284">[284]valiant Hector, the prophetess Cassandra,
  and Paris, the cause of the Trojan war.

  Before the birth of her second son Paris, Hecuba dreamt that she had
  given birth to a flaming brand, which was interpreted by Æsacus the seer
  (a son of Priam by a former marriage) to signify that she would bear a
  son who would cause the destruction of the city of Troy. Anxious to
  prevent the fulfilment of the prophecy, Hecuba caused her new-born babe
  to be exposed on Mount Ida to perish; but being found by some
  kind-hearted shepherds, the child was reared by them, and grew up
  unconscious of his noble birth.

  As the boy approached manhood he became remarkable, not only for his
  wonderful beauty of form and feature, but also for his strength and
  courage, which he exercised in defending the flocks from the attacks of
  robbers and wild beasts; hence he was called Alexander, or helper of men.
  It was about this time that he settled the famous dispute concerning the
  golden apple, thrown by the goddess of Discord into the assembly of the
  gods. As we have already seen, he gave his decision in favour of
  Aphrodite; thus creating for himself two implacable enemies, for Hera and
  Athene never forgave the slight.

  Paris became united to a beautiful nymph named        none, with whom
  he lived happily in the seclusion and tranquillity of a pastoral life;
  but to her deep grief this peaceful existence was not fated to be of long
  duration.

  Hearing that some funereal games were about to be held in Troy in
  honour of a departed relative of the king, Paris resolved to visit the
  capital and take part in them himself. There he so greatly distinguished
  himself in a contest with his unknown brothers, Hector and Deiphobus,
  that the proud young princes, enraged that an obscure shepherd should
  snatch from them the prize of victory, were about to create a
  disturbance, when Cassandra, who had been a spectator of the proceedings,
  stepped forward, and announced to them that the humble peasant who had so
  signally defeated them was their own  span
  class="pagenum">[285]brother Paris. He was
  then conducted to the presence of his parents, who joyfully acknowledged
  him as their child; and amidst the festivities and rejoicings in honour
  of their new-found son the ominous prediction of the past was
  forgotten.

  As a proof of his confidence, the king now intrusted Paris with a
  somewhat delicate mission. As we have already seen in the Legend of
  Heracles, that great hero conquered Troy, and after killing king
  Laomedon, carried away captive his beautiful daughter Hesione, whom he
  bestowed in marriage on his friend Telamon. But although she became
  princess of Salamis, and lived happily with her husband, her brother
  Priam never ceased to regret her loss, and the indignity which had been
  passed upon his house; and it was now proposed that Paris should be
  equipped with a numerous fleet, and proceed to Greece in order to demand
  the restoration of the king's sister.

  Before setting out on this expedition, Paris was warned by Cassandra
  against bringing home a wife from Greece, and she predicted that if he
  disregarded her injunction he would bring inevitable ruin upon the city
  of Troy, and destruction to the house of Priam.

  Under the command of Paris the fleet set sail, and arrived safely in
  Greece. Here the young Trojan prince first beheld Helen, the daughter of
  Zeus and Leda, and sister of the Dioscuri, who was the wife of Menelaus,
  king of Sparta, and the loveliest woman of her time. The most renowned
  heroes in Greece had sought the honour of her hand; but her stepfather,
  Tyndareus, king of Sparta, fearing that if he bestowed her in marriage on
  one of her numerous lovers he would make enemies of the rest, made it a
  stipulation that all suitors should solemnly swear to assist and defend
  the successful candidate, with all the means at their command, in any
  feud which might hereafter arise in connection with the marriage. He at
  length conferred the hand of Helen upon Menelaus, a warlike prince,
  devoted to martial exercises and the pleasures of the chase, to whom he
  resigned his throne and kingdom.

[286]

  When Paris arrived at Sparta, and sought hospitality at the royal
  palace, he was kindly received by king Menelaus. At the banquet given in
  his honour, he charmed both host and hostess by his graceful manner and
  varied accomplishments, and specially ingratiated himself with the fair
  Helen, to whom he presented some rare and chaste trinkets of Asiatic
  manufacture.

  Whilst Paris was still a guest at the court of the king of Sparta, the
  latter received an invitation from his friend Idomeneus, king of Crete,
  to join him in a hunting expedition; and Menelaus, being of an
  unsuspicious and easy temperament, accepted the invitation, leaving to
  Helen the duty of entertaining the distinguished stranger. Captivated by
  her surpassing loveliness, the Trojan prince forgot every sense of honour
  and duty, and resolved to rob his absent host of his beautiful wife. He
  accordingly collected his followers, and with their assistance stormed
  the royal castle, possessed himself of the rich treasures which it
  contained, and succeeded in carrying off its beautiful, and not
  altogether unwilling mistress.

  They at once set sail, but were driven by stress of weather to the
  island of Crania, where they cast anchor; and it was not until some years
  had elapsed, during which time home and country were forgotten, that
  Paris and Helen proceeded to Troy.

  Preparations for the War.       When Menelaus heard of the
  violation of his hearth and home he proceeded to Pylos, accompanied by
  his brother Agamemnon, in order to consult the wise old king Nestor, who
  was renowned for his great experience and state-craft. On hearing the
  facts of the case Nestor expressed it as his opinion that only by means
  of the combined efforts of all the states of Greece could Menelaus hope
  to regain Helen in defiance of so powerful a kingdom as that of Troy.

  Menelaus and Agamemnon now raised the war-cry, which was unanimously
  responded to from one end of Greece to the other. Many of those who
  volunteered  a
  name="page287">[287]their services were former suitors of the
  fair Helen, and were therefore bound by their oath to support the cause
  of Menelaus; others joined from pure love of adventure, but one and all
  were deeply impressed with the disgrace which would attach to their
  country should such a crime be suffered to go unpunished. Thus a powerful
  army was collected in which few names of note were missing.

  Only in the case of two great heroes, Odysseus (Ulysses) and Achilles,
  did Menelaus experience any difficulty.

  Odysseus, famed for his wisdom and great astuteness, was at this time
  living happily in Ithaca with his fair young wife Penelope and his little
  son Telemachus, and was loath to leave his happy home for a perilous
  foreign expedition of uncertain duration. When therefore his services
  were solicited he feigned madness; but the shrewd Palamedes, a
  distinguished hero in the suite of Menelaus, detected and exposed the
  ruse, and thus Odysseus was forced to join in the war. But he never
  forgave the interference of Palamedes, and, as we shall see, eventually
  revenged himself upon him in a most cruel manner.

  Achilles was the son of Peleus and the sea-goddess Thetis, who is said
  to have dipped her son, when a babe, in the river Styx, and thereby
  rendered him invulnerable, except in the right heel, by which she held
  him. When the boy was nine years old it was foretold to Thetis that he
  would either enjoy a long life of inglorious ease and inactivity, or that
  after a brief career of victory he would die the death of a hero.
  Naturally desirous of prolonging the life of her son, the fond mother
  devoutly hoped that the former fate might be allotted to him. With this
  view she conveyed him to the island of Scyros, in the Ægean Sea, where,
  disguised as a girl, he was brought up among the daughters of Lycomedes,
  king of the country.

  Now that the presence of Achilles was required, owing to an oracular
  prediction that Troy could not be taken without him, Menelaus consulted
  Calchas the soothsayer, who revealed to him the place of his concealment.
  Odysseus was accordingly despatched to Scyros, where, by  !-- Page 288
  -->[288]means of a
  clever device, he soon discovered which among the maidens was the object
  of his search. Disguising himself as a merchant, Odysseus obtained an
  introduction to the royal palace, where he offered to the king's
  daughters various trinkets for sale. The girls, with one exception, all
  examined his wares with unfeigned interest. Observing this circumstance
  Odysseus shrewdly concluded that the one who held aloof must be none
  other than the young Achilles himself. But in order further to test the
  correctness of his deduction, he now exhibited a beautiful set of warlike
  accoutrements, whilst, at a given signal, stirring strains of martial
  music were heard outside; whereupon Achilles, fired with warlike ardour,
  seized the weapons, and thus revealed his identity. He now joined the
  cause of the Greeks, accompanied at the request of his father by his
  kinsman Patroclus, and contributed to the expedition a large force of
  Thessalian troops, or Myrmidons, as they were called, and also fifty
  ships.

  For ten long years Agamemnon and the other chiefs devoted all their
  energy and means in preparing for the expedition against Troy. But during
  these warlike preparations an attempt at a peaceful solution of the
  difficulty was not neglected. An embassy consisting of Menelaus,
  Odysseus,      c., was despatched to king Priam demanding the surrender
  of Helen; but though the embassy was received with the utmost pomp and
  ceremony, the demand was nevertheless rejected; upon which the
  ambassadors returned to Greece, and the order was given for the fleet to
  assemble at Aulis, in B       otia.

  Never before in the annals of Greece had so large an army been
  collected. A hundred thousand warriors were assembled at Aulis, and in
  its bay floated over a thousand ships, ready to convey them to the Trojan
  coast. The command of this mighty host was intrusted to Agamemnon, king
  of Argos, the most powerful of all the Greek princes.

  Before the fleet set sail solemn sacrifices were offered to the gods
  on the sea-shore, when suddenly a serpent was seen to ascend a
  plane-tree, in which was a sparrow's  span
  class="pagenum">[289]nest containing nine
  young ones. The reptile first devoured the young birds and then their
  mother, after which it was turned by Zeus into stone. Calchas the
  soothsayer, on being consulted, interpreted the miracle to signify that
  the war with Troy would last for nine years, and that only in the tenth
  would the city be taken.

  Departure of the Greek Fleet.       The fleet then set sail;
  but mistaking the Mysian coast for that of Troy, they landed troops and
  commenced to ravage the country. Telephus, king of the Mysians, who was a
  son of the great hero Heracles, opposed them with a large army, and
  succeeded in driving them back to their ships, but was himself wounded in
  the engagement by the spear of Achilles. Patroclus, who fought valiantly
  by the side of his kinsman, was also wounded in this battle; but
  Achilles, who was a pupil of Chiron, carefully bound up the wound, which
  he succeeded in healing; and from this incident dates the celebrated
  friendship which ever after existed between the two heroes, who even in
  death remained united.

  The Greeks now returned to Aulis. Meanwhile, the wound of Telephus
  proving incurable, he consulted an oracle, and the response was, that he
  alone who had inflicted the wound possessed the power of curing it.
  Telephus accordingly proceeded to the Greek camp, where he was healed by
  Achilles, and, at the solicitation of Odysseus, consented to act as guide
  in the voyage to Troy.

  Just as the expedition was about to start for the second time,
  Agamemnon had the misfortune to kill a hind sacred to Artemis, who, in
  her anger, sent continuous calms, which prevented the fleet from setting
  sail. Calchas on being consulted announced that the sacrifice of
  Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon, would alone appease the incensed
  goddess. How Agamemnon at length overcame his feelings as a father, and
  how Iphigenia was saved by Artemis herself, has been already related in a
  previous chapter.

  A fair wind having at length sprung up, the fleet  !-- Page 290
  -->[290]once more set
  sail. They first stopped at the island of Tenedos, where the famous
  archer Philoctetes       who possessed the bow and arrows of Heracles,
  given to him by the dying hero       was bitten in the foot by a venomous
  snake. So unbearable was the odour emitted by the wound, that, at the
  suggestion of Odysseus, Philoctetes was conveyed to the island of Lesbos,
  where, to his great chagrin, he was abandoned to his fate, and the fleet
  proceeded on their journey to Troy.

  Commencement of Hostilities.       Having received early
  intelligence of the impending invasion of their country, the Trojans
  sought the assistance of the neighbouring states, who all gallantly
  responded to their call for help, and thus ample preparations were made
  to receive the enemy. King Priam being himself too advanced in years for
  active service, the command of the army devolved upon his eldest son, the
  brave and valiant Hector.

  At the approach of the Greek fleet the Trojans appeared on the coast
  in order to prevent their landing. But great hesitation prevailed among
  the troops as to who should be the first to set foot on the enemy's soil,
  it having been predicted that whoever did so would fall a sacrifice to
  the Fates. Protesilaus of Phylace, however, nobly disregarding the
  ominous prediction, leaped on shore, and fell by the hand of Hector.

  The Greeks then succeeded in effecting a landing, and in the
  engagement which ensued the Trojans were signally defeated, and driven to
  seek safety behind the walls of their city. With Achilles at their head
  the Greeks now made a desperate attempt to take the city by storm, but
  were repulsed with terrible losses. After this defeat the invaders,
  foreseeing a long and wearisome campaign, drew up their ships on land,
  erected tents, huts,      c., and formed an intrenched camp on the
  coast.

  Between the Greek camp and the city of Troy was a plain watered by the
  rivers Scamander and Simois, and it was on this plain, afterwards so
  renowned in history,  a
  name="page291">[291]that the ever memorable battles between
  the Greeks and Trojans were fought.

  The impossibility of taking the city by storm was now recognized by
  the leaders of the Greek forces. The Trojans, on their side, being less
  numerous than the enemy, dared not venture on a great battle in the open
  field; hence the war dragged on for many weary years without any decisive
  engagement taking place.

  It was about this time that Odysseus carried out his long meditated
  revenge against Palamedes. Palamedes was one of the wisest, most
  energetic, and most upright of all the Greek heroes, and it was in
  consequence of his unflagging zeal and wonderful eloquence that most of
  the chiefs had been induced to join the expedition. But the very
  qualities which endeared him to the hearts of his countrymen rendered him
  hateful in the eyes of his implacable enemy, Odysseus, who never forgave
  his having detected his scheme to avoid joining the army.

  In order to effect the ruin of Palamedes, Odysseus concealed in his
  tent a vast sum of money. He next wrote a letter, purporting to be from
  king Priam to Palamedes, in which the former thanked the Greek hero
  effusively for the valuable information received from him, referring at
  the same time to a large sum of money which he had sent to him as a
  reward. This letter, which was found upon the person of a Phrygian
  prisoner, was read aloud in a council of the Greek princes. Palamedes was
  arraigned before the chiefs of the army and accused of betraying his
  country to the enemy, whereupon a search was instituted, and a large sum
  of money being found in his tent, he was pronounced guilty and sentenced
  to be stoned to death. Though fully aware of the base treachery practised
  against him, Palamedes offered not a word in self-defence, knowing but
  too well that, in the face of such damning evidence, the attempt to prove
  his innocence would be vain.

  Defection of Achilles.       During the first year of the
  campaign the Greeks ravaged the surrounding country,  !-- Page 292
  -->[292]and pillaged
  the neighbouring villages. Upon one of these foraging expeditions the
  city of Pedasus was sacked, and Agamemnon, as commander-in-chief,
  received as his share of the spoil the beautiful Chrysëis, daughter of
  Chryses, the priest of Apollo; whilst to Achilles was allotted another
  captive, the fair Brisëis. The following day Chryses, anxious to ransom
  his daughter, repaired to the Greek camp; but Agamemnon refused to accede
  to his proposal, and with rude and insulting words drove the old man
  away. Full of grief at the loss of his child Chryses called upon Apollo
  for vengeance on her captor. His prayer was heard, and the god sent a
  dreadful pestilence which raged for ten days in the camp of the Greeks.
  Achilles at length called together a council, and inquired of Calchas the
  soothsayer how to arrest this terrible visitation of the gods. The seer
  replied that Apollo, incensed at the insult offered to his priest, had
  sent the plague, and that only by the surrender of Chrysëis could his
  anger be appeased.

  On hearing this Agamemnon agreed to resign the maiden; but being
  already embittered against Calchas for his prediction with regard to his
  own daughter Iphigenia, he now heaped insults upon the soothsayer and
  accused him of plotting against his interests. Achilles espoused the
  cause of Calchas, and a violent dispute arose, in which the son of Thetis
  would have killed his chief but for the timely interference of
  Pallas-Athene, who suddenly appeared beside him, unseen by the rest, and
  recalled him to a sense of the duty he owed to his commander. Agamemnon
  revenged himself on Achilles by depriving him of his beautiful captive,
  the fair Brisëis, who had become so attached to her kind and noble captor
  that she wept bitterly on being removed from his charge. Achilles, now
  fairly disgusted with the ungenerous conduct of his chief, withdrew
  himself to his tent, and obstinately declined to take further part in the
  war.

  Heart-sore and dejected he repaired to the sea-shore, and there
  invoked the presence of his divine mother. In answer to his prayer Thetis
  emerged from beneath  a
  name="page293">[293]the waves, and comforted her gallant son
  with the assurance that she would entreat the mighty Zeus to avenge his
  wrongs by giving victory to the Trojans, so that the Greeks might learn
  to realize the great loss which they had sustained by his withdrawal from
  the army. The Trojans being informed by one of their spies of the
  defection of Achilles, became emboldened by the absence of this brave and
  intrepid leader, whom they feared above all the other Greek heroes; they
  accordingly sallied forth, and made a bold and eminently successful
  attack upon the Greeks, who, although they most bravely and obstinately
  defended their position, were completely routed, and driven back to their
  intrenchments, Agamemnon and most of the other Greek leaders being
  wounded in the engagement.

  Encouraged by this marked and signal success the Trojans now commenced
  to besiege the Greeks in their own camp. At this juncture Agamemnon,
  seeing the danger which threatened the army, sunk for the moment all
  personal grievances, and despatched an embassy to Achilles consisting of
  many noble and distinguished chiefs, urgently entreating him to come to
  the assistance of his countrymen in this their hour of peril; promising
  that not only should the fair Brisëis be restored to him, but also that
  the hand of his own daughter should be bestowed on him in marriage, with
  seven towns as her dowry. But the obstinate determination of the proud
  hero was not to be moved; and though he listened courteously to the
  arguments and representations of the messengers of Agamemnon, his
  resolution to take no further part in the war remained unshaken.

  In one of the engagements which took place soon afterwards, the
  Trojans, under the command of Hector, penetrated into the heart of the
  Greek camp, and had already commenced to burn their ships, when
  Patroclus, seeing the distress of his countrymen, earnestly besought
  Achilles to send him to the rescue at the head of the Myrmidons. The
  better nature of the hero prevailed, and he not only intrusted to his
  friend the command of  a
  name="page294">[294]his brave band of warriors, but lent him
  also his own suit of armour.

  Patroclus having mounted the war-chariot of the hero, Achilles lifted
  on high a golden goblet and poured out a libation of wine to the gods,
  accompanied by an earnest petition for victory, and the safe return of
  his beloved comrade. As a parting injunction he warned Patroclus against
  advancing too far into the territory of the enemy, and entreated him to
  be content with rescuing the galleys.

  At the head of the Myrmidons Patroclus now made a desperate attack
  upon the enemy, who, thinking that the invincible Achilles was himself in
  command of his battalions, became disheartened, and were put to flight.
  Patroclus followed up his victory and pursued the Trojans as far as the
  walls of their city, altogether forgetting in the excitement of battle
  the injunction of his friend Achilles. But his temerity cost the young
  hero his life, for he now encountered the mighty Hector himself, and fell
  by his hands. Hector stripped the armour from his dead foe, and would
  have dragged the body into the city had not Menelaus and Ajax the Greater
  rushed forward, and after a long and fierce struggle succeeded in
  rescuing it from desecration.

  Death of Hector.       And now came the mournful task of
  informing Achilles of the fate of his friend. He wept bitterly over the
  dead body of his comrade, and solemnly vowed that the funereal rites
  should not be solemnized in his honour until he had slain Hector with his
  own hands, and captured twelve Trojans to be immolated on his funeral
  pyre. All other considerations vanished before the burning desire to
  avenge the death of his friend; and Achilles, now thoroughly aroused from
  his apathy, became reconciled to Agamemnon, and rejoined the Greek army.
  At the request of the goddess Thetis, Hephæstus forged for him a new suit
  of armour, which far surpassed in magnificence that of all the other
  heroes.

  Thus gloriously arrayed he was soon seen striding  !-- Page 295
  -->[295]along, calling
  the Greeks to arms. He now led the troops against the enemy, who were
  defeated and put to flight until, near the gates of the city, Achilles
  and Hector encountered each other. But here, for the first time
  throughout his whole career, the courage of the Trojan hero deserted him.
  At the near approach of his redoubtable antagonist he turned and fled for
  his life. Achilles pursued him; and thrice round the walls of the city
  was the terrible race run, in sight of the old king and queen, who had
  mounted the walls to watch the battle. Hector endeavoured, during each
  course, to reach the city gates, so that his comrades might open them to
  admit him or cover him with their missiles; but his adversary, seeing his
  design, forced him into the open plain, at the same time calling to his
  friends to hurl no spear upon his foe, but to leave to him the vengeance
  he had so long panted for. At length, wearied with the hot pursuit,
  Hector made a stand and challenged his foe to single combat. A desperate
  encounter took place, in which Hector succumbed to his powerful adversary
  at the Scæan gate; and with his last dying breath the Trojan hero
  foretold to his conqueror that he himself would soon perish on the same
  spot.

  The infuriated victor bound the lifeless corse of his fallen foe to
  his chariot, and dragged it three times round the city walls and thence
  to the Greek camp. Overwhelmed with horror at this terrible scene the
  aged parents of Hector uttered such heart-rending cries of anguish that
  they reached the ears of Andromache, his faithful wife, who, rushing to
  the walls, beheld the dead body of her husband, bound to the conqueror's
  car.

  Achilles now solemnized the funereal rites in honour of his friend
  Patroclus. The dead body of the hero was borne to the funeral pile by the
  Myrmidons in full panoply. His dogs and horses were then slain to
  accompany him, in case he should need them in the realm of shades; after
  which Achilles, in fulfilment of his savage vow, slaughtered twelve brave
  Trojan captives, who were  a
  name="page296">[296]laid on the funeral pyre, which was now
  lighted. When all was consumed the bones of Patroclus were carefully
  collected and inclosed in a golden urn. Then followed the funereal games,
  which consisted of chariot-races, fighting with the cestus (a sort of
  boxing-glove), wrestling matches, foot-races, and single combats with
  shield and spear, in all of which the most distinguished heroes took
  part, and contended for the prizes.

  Penthesilea.       After the death of Hector, their great hope
  and bulwark, the Trojans did not venture beyond the walls of their city.
  But soon their hopes were revived by the appearance of a powerful army of
  Amazons under the command of their queen Penthesilea, a daughter of Ares,
  whose great ambition was to measure swords with the renowned Achilles
  himself, and to avenge the death of the valiant Hector.

  Hostilities now recommenced in the open plain. Penthesilea led the
  Trojan host; the Greeks on their side being under the command of Achilles
  and Ajax. Whilst the latter succeeded in putting the enemy to flight,
  Achilles was challenged by Penthesilea to single combat. With heroic
  courage she went forth to the fight; but even the strongest men failed
  before the power of the great Achilles, and though a daughter of Ares,
  Penthesilea was but a woman. With generous chivalry the hero endeavoured
  to spare the brave and beautiful maiden-warrior, and only when his own
  life was in imminent danger did he make a serious effort to vanquish his
  enemy, when Penthesilea shared the fate of all who ventured to oppose the
  spear of Achilles, and fell by his hand.

  Feeling herself fatally wounded, she remembered the desecration of the
  dead body of Hector, and earnestly entreated the forbearance of the hero.
  But the petition was hardly necessary, for Achilles, full of compassion
  for his brave but unfortunate adversary, lifted her gently from the
  ground, and she expired in his arms.

  On beholding the dead body of their leader in the  !-- Page 297
  -->[297]possession of
  Achilles, the Amazons and Trojans prepared for a fresh attack in order to
  wrest it from his hands; but observing their purpose, Achilles stepped
  forward and loudly called upon them to halt. Then in a few well-chosen
  words he praised the great valour and intrepidity of the fallen queen,
  and expressed his willingness to resign the body at once.

  The chivalrous conduct of Achilles was fully appreciated by both
  Greeks and Trojans. Thersites alone, a base and cowardly wretch,
  attributed unworthy motives to the gracious proceedings of the hero; and,
  not content with these insinuations, he savagely pierced with his lance
  the dead body of the Amazonian queen; whereupon Achilles, with one blow
  of his powerful arm, felled him to the ground, and killed him on the
  spot.

  The well-merited death of Thersites excited no commiseration, but his
  kinsman Diomedes came forward and claimed compensation for the murder of
  his relative; and as Agamemnon, who, as commander-in-chief, might easily
  have settled the difficulty, refrained from interfering, the proud nature
  of Achilles resented the implied condemnation of his conduct, and he once
  more abandoned the Greek army and took ship for Lesbos. Odysseus,
  however, followed him to the island, and, with his usual tact, succeeded
  in inducing the hero to return to the camp.

  Death of Achilles.       A new ally of the Trojans now appeared
  on the field in the person of Memnon, the Æthiopian, a son of Eos and
  Tithonus, who brought with him a powerful reinforcement of negroes.
  Memnon was the first opponent who had yet encountered Achilles on an
  equal footing; for like the great hero himself he was the son of a
  goddess, and possessed also, like Achilles, a suit of armour made for him
  by Hephæstus.

  Before the heroes encountered each other in single combat, the two
  goddesses, Thetis and Eos, hastened to Olympus to intercede with its
  mighty ruler for the life of their sons. Resolved even in this instance
  not to act in opposition to the Moiræ, Zeus seized the golden scales  !--
  Page 298 -->[298]in
  which he weighed the lot of mortals, and placed in it the respective
  fates of the two heroes, whereupon that of Memnon weighed down the
  balance, thus portending his death.

  Eos abandoned Olympus in despair. Arrived on the battlefield she
  beheld the lifeless body of her son, who, after a long and brave defence,
  had at length succumbed to the all-conquering arm of Achilles. At her
  command her children, the Winds, flew down to the plain, and seizing the
  body of the slain hero conveyed it through the air safe from the
  desecration of the enemy.

  The triumph of Achilles was not of long duration. Intoxicated with
  success he attempted, at the head of the Greek army, to storm the city of
  Troy, when Paris, by the aid of Ph       bus-Apollo, aimed a
  well-directed dart at the hero, which pierced his vulnerable heel, and he
  fell to the ground fatally wounded before the Scæan gate. But though face
  to face with death, the intrepid hero, raising himself from the ground,
  still performed prodigies of valour, and not until his tottering limbs
  refused their office was the enemy aware that the wound was mortal.

  By the combined efforts of Ajax and Odysseus the body of Achilles was
  wrested from the enemy after a long and terrible fight, and conveyed to
  the Greek camp. Weeping bitterly over the untimely fate of her gallant
  son, Thetis came to embrace him for the last time, and mingled her
  regrets and lamentations with those of the whole Greek army. The funeral
  pyre was then lighted, and the voices of the Muses were heard chanting
  his funeral dirge. When, according to the custom of the ancients, the
  body had been burned on the pyre, the bones of the hero were collected,
  inclosed in a golden urn, and deposited beside the remains of his beloved
  friend Patroclus.

  In the funereal games celebrated in honour of the fallen hero, the
  property of her son was offered by Thetis as the prize of victory. But it
  was unanimously agreed that the beautiful suit of armour made by
  Hephæstus should be awarded to him who had contributed the most to the
   a
  name="page299">[299]rescue of the body from the hands of the
  enemy. Popular opinion unanimously decided in favour of Odysseus, which
  verdict was confirmed by the Trojan prisoners who were present at the
  engagement. Unable to endure the slight, the unfortunate Ajax lost his
  reason, and in this condition put an end to his existence.

  Final Measures.       Thus were the Greeks deprived at one and
  the same time of their bravest and most powerful leader, and of him also
  who approached the nearest to this distinction. For a time operations
  were at a standstill, until Odysseus at length, contrived by means of a
  cleverly-arranged ambush to capture Helenus, the son of Priam. Like his
  sister Cassandra, Helenus possessed the gift of prophecy, and the
  unfortunate youth was now coerced by Odysseus into using this gift
  against the welfare of his native city.

  The Greeks learned from the Trojan prince that three conditions were
  indispensable to the conquest of Troy:       In the first place the son
  of Achilles must fight in their ranks; secondly, the arrows of Heracles
  must be used against the enemy; and thirdly, they must obtain possession
  of the wooden image of Pallas-Athene, the famous Palladium of Troy.

  The first condition was easily fulfilled. Ever ready to serve the
  interests of the community, Odysseus repaired to the island of Scyros,
  where he found Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles. Having succeeded in
  arousing the ambition of the fiery youth, he generously resigned to him
  the magnificent armour of his father, and then conveyed him to the Greek
  camp, where he immediately distinguished himself in single combat with
  Eurypylus, the son of Telephus, who had come to the aid of the
  Trojans.

  To procure the poison-dipped arrows of Heracles was a matter of
  greater difficulty. They were still in the possession of the
  much-aggrieved Philoctetes, who had remained in the island of Lemnos, his
  wound still unhealed, suffering the most abject misery. But the  !-- Page
  300 -->[300]judicious
  zeal of the indefatigable and ever-active Odysseus, who was accompanied
  in this undertaking by Diomedes, at length gained the day, and he induced
  Philoctetes to accompany him to the camp, where the skilful leech
  Machaon, the son of Asclepias, healed him of his wound.

  Philoctetes became reconciled to Agamemnon, and in an engagement which
  took place soon after, he mortally wounded Paris, the son of Priam. But
  though pierced by the fatal arrow of the demi-god, death did not
  immediately ensue; and Paris, calling to mind the prediction of an
  oracle, that his deserted wife        none could alone cure him if
  wounded, caused himself to be transported to her abode on Mount Ida,
  where he implored her by the memory of their past love to save his life.
  But mindful only of her wrongs,        none crushed out of her heart
  every womanly feeling of pity and compassion, and sternly bade him
  depart. Soon, however, all her former affection for her husband awoke
  within her. With frantic haste she followed him; but on her arrival in
  the city she found the dead body of Paris already laid on the lighted
  funeral pile, and, in her remorse and despair,        none threw herself
  on the lifeless form of her husband and perished in the flames.

  The Trojans were now shut up within their walls and closely besieged;
  but the third and most difficult condition being still unfulfilled, all
  efforts to take the city were unavailing. In this emergency the wise and
  devoted Odysseus came once more to the aid of his comrades. Having
  disfigured himself with self-inflicted wounds, he assumed the disguise of
  a wretched old mendicant, and then crept stealthily into the city in
  order to discover where the Palladium was preserved. He succeeded in his
  object, and was recognized by no one save the fair Helen, who after the
  death of Paris had been given in marriage to his brother Deiphobus. But
  since death had robbed her of her lover, the heart of the Greek princess
  had turned yearningly towards her native country and her husband
  Menelaus, and Odysseus now found in her a most unlooked-for ally. On his
  return to the camp  a
  name="page301">[301]Odysseus called to his aid the valiant
  Diomedes, and with his assistance the perilous task of abstracting the
  Palladium from its sacred precincts was, after some difficulty,
  effected.

  The conditions of conquest being now fulfilled, a council was called
  to decide on final proceedings. Epeios, a Greek sculptor, who had
  accompanied the expedition, was desired to construct a colossal wooden
  horse large enough to contain a number of able and distinguished heroes.
  On its completion a band of warriors concealed themselves within,
  whereupon the Greek army broke up their camp, and then set fire to it, as
  though, wearied of the long and tedious ten years' siege, they had
  abandoned the enterprise as hopeless.

  Accompanied by Agamemnon and the sage Nestor, the fleet set sail for
  the island of Tenedos, where they cast anchor, anxiously awaiting the
  torch signal to hasten back to the Trojan coast.

  Destruction of Troy.       When the Trojans saw the enemy
  depart, and the Greek camp in flames, they believed themselves safe at
  last, and streamed in great numbers out of the town in order to view the
  site where the Greeks had so long encamped. Here they found the gigantic
  wooden horse, which they examined with wondering curiosity, various
  opinions being expressed with regard to its utility. Some supposed it to
  be an engine of war, and were in favour of destroying it, others regarded
  it as a sacred idol, and proposed that it should be brought into the
  city. Two circumstances which now occurred induced the Trojans to incline
  towards the latter opinion.

  Chief among those who suspected a treacherous design in this huge
  contrivance was Laocoon, a priest of Apollo, who, in company with his two
  young sons, had issued from the city with the Trojans in order to offer a
  sacrifice to the gods. With all the eloquence at his command he urged his
  countrymen not to place confidence in any gift of the Greeks, and even
  went so far as to pierce the  a
  name="page302">[302]side of the horse with a spear which he
  took from a warrior beside him, whereupon the arms of the heroes were
  heard to rattle. The hearts of the brave men concealed inside the horse
  quailed within them, and they had already given themselves up for lost,
  when Pallas-Athene, who ever watched over the cause of the Greeks, now
  came to their aid, and a miracle occurred in order to blind and deceive
  the devoted Trojans;       for the fall of Troy was decreed by the
  gods.

      alt="Laocoon and his sons" title="Laocoon and his sons" />
  
  Whilst Laocoon with his two sons stood prepared to perform the
  sacrifice, two enormous serpents suddenly rose out of the sea, and made
  direct for the altar. They entwined themselves first round the tender
  limbs of the helpless youths, and then encircled their father who rushed
  to their assistance, and thus all three were destroyed in sight of the
  horrified multitude. The Trojans naturally interpreted the fate of
  Laocoon and his sons to be a punishment sent by Zeus for his sacrilege
  against the wooden horse, and were now fully convinced that it must be
  consecrated to the gods.

  The crafty Odysseus had left behind his trusty friend Sinon with full
  instructions as to his course of action. Assuming the rôle assigned to
  him, he now approached king Priam with fettered hands and piteous
  entreaties, alleging that the Greeks, in obedience to the command of an
  oracle, had attempted to immolate him as a sacrifice; but that he had
  contrived to escape from their hands, and now sought protection from the
  king.

  The kind-hearted monarch, believing his story, released  !-- Page 303
  -->[303]his bonds,
  assured him of his favour, and then begged him to explain the true
  meaning of the wooden horse. Sinon willingly complied. He informed the
  king that Pallas-Athene, who had hitherto been the hope and stay of the
  Greeks throughout the war, was so deeply offended at the removal of her
  sacred image, the Palladium, from her temple in Troy, that she had
  withdrawn her protection from the Greeks, and refused all further aid
  till it was restored to its rightful place. Hence the Greeks had returned
  home in order to seek fresh instructions from an oracle. But before
  leaving, Calchas the seer had advised their building this gigantic wooden
  horse as a tribute to the offended goddess, hoping thereby to appease her
  just anger. He further explained that it had been constructed of such
  colossal proportions in order to prevent its being brought into the city,
  so that the favour of Pallas-Athene might not be transferred to the
  Trojans.

  Hardly had the crafty Sinon ceased speaking when the Trojans, with one
  accord, urged that the wooden horse should be brought into their city
  without delay. The gates being too low to admit its entrance, a breach
  was made in the walls, and the horse was conveyed in triumph into the
  very heart of Troy; whereupon the Trojans, overjoyed at what they deemed
  the successful issue of the campaign, abandoned themselves to feasting
  and rioting.

  Amidst the universal rejoicing the unhappy Cassandra, foreseeing the
  result of the admission of the wooden horse into the city, was seen
  rushing through the streets with wild gestures and dishevelled hair,
  warning her people against the dangers which awaited them. But her
  eloquent words fell on deaf ears; for it was ever the fate of the
  unfortunate prophetess that her predictions should find no credence.

  When, after the day's excitement, the Trojans had retired to rest, and
  all was hushed and silent, Sinon, in the dead of night, released the
  heroes from their voluntary imprisonment. The signal was then given to
  the Greek fleet lying off Tenedos, and the whole army in unbroken silence
  once more landed on the Trojan coast.  span
  class="pagenum">[304]

  To enter the city was now an easy matter, and a fearful slaughter
  ensued. Aroused from their slumbers, the Trojans, under the command of
  their bravest leaders, made a gallant defence, but were easily overcome.
  All their most valiant heroes fell in the fight, and soon the whole city
  was wrapt in flames.

  Priam fell by the hand of Neoptolemus, who killed him as he lay
  prostrate before the altar of Zeus, praying for divine assistance in this
  awful hour of peril. The unfortunate Andromache with her young son
  Astyanax had taken refuge on the summit of a tower, where she was
  discovered by the victors, who, fearing lest the son of Hector might one
  day rise against them to avenge the death of his father, tore him from
  her arms and hurled him over the battlements.

  Æneas alone, the son of Aphrodite, the beloved of gods and men,
  escaped the universal carnage with his son and his old father Anchises,
  whom he carried on his shoulders out of the city. He first sought refuge
  on Mount Ida, and afterwards fled to Italy, where he became the ancestral
  hero of the Roman people.

  Menelaus now sought Helen in the royal palace, who, being immortal,
  still retained all her former beauty and fascination. A reconciliation
  took place, and she accompanied her husband on his homeward voyage.
  Andromache, the widow of the brave Hector, was given in marriage to
  Neoptolemus, Cassandra fell to the share of Agamemnon, and Hecuba, the
  gray-haired and widowed queen, was made prisoner by Odysseus.

  The boundless treasures of the wealthy Trojan king fell into the hands
  of the Greek heroes, who, after having levelled the city of Troy to the
  ground, prepared for their homeward voyage.

RETURN OF THE GREEKS FROM TROY.

  During the sacking of the city of Troy the Greeks, in the hour of
  victory, committed many acts of desecration and cruelty, which called
  down upon them the wrath of the  a
  name="page305">[305]gods, for which reason their homeward
  voyage was beset with manifold dangers and disasters, and many perished
  before they reached their native land.

  Nestor, Diomedes, Philoctetes, and Neoptolemus were among those who
  arrived safely in Greece after a prosperous voyage. The vessel which
  carried Menelaus and Helen was driven by violent tempests to the coast of
  Egypt, and only after many years of weary wanderings and vicissitudes did
  they succeed in reaching their home at Sparta.

  Ajax the Lesser having offended Pallas-Athene by desecrating her
  temple on the night of the destruction of Troy, was shipwrecked off Cape
  Caphareus. He succeeded, however, in clinging to a rock, and his life
  might have been spared but for his impious boast that he needed not the
  help of the gods. No sooner had he uttered the sacrilegious words than
  Poseidon, enraged at his audacity, split with his trident the rock to
  which the hero was clinging, and the unfortunate Ajax was overwhelmed by
  the waves.

  Fate of Agamemnon.       The homeward voyage of Agamemnon was
  tolerably uneventful and prosperous; but on his arrival at Mycenæ
  misfortune and ruin awaited him.

  His wife Clytemnestra, in revenge for the sacrifice of her beloved
  daughter Iphigenia, had formed a secret alliance during his absence with
  Ægisthus, the son of Thyestes, and on the return of Agamemnon they both
  conspired to compass his destruction. Clytemnestra feigned the greatest
  joy on beholding her husband, and in spite of the urgent warnings of
  Cassandra, who was now a captive in his train, he received her
  protestations of affection with the most trusting confidence. In her
  well-assumed anxiety for the comfort of the weary traveller, she prepared
  a warm bath for his refreshment, and at a given signal from the
  treacherous queen, Ægisthus, who was concealed in an adjoining chamber,
  rushed upon the defenceless hero and slew him.  span
  class="pagenum">[306]

  During the massacre of the retainers of Agamemnon which followed, his
  daughter Electra, with great presence of mind, contrived to save her
  young brother Orestes. He fled for refuge to his uncle Strophius, king of
  Phocis, who educated him with his own son Pylades, and an ardent
  friendship sprung up between the youths, which, from its constancy and
  disinterestedness, has become proverbial.

  As Orestes grew up to manhood, his one great all-absorbing desire was
  to avenge the death of his father. Accompanied by his faithful friend
  Pylades, he repaired in disguise to Mycenæ, where Ægisthus and
  Clytemnestra reigned conjointly over the kingdom of Argos. In order to
  disarm suspicion he had taken the precaution to despatch a messenger to
  Clytemnestra, purporting to be sent by king Strophius, to announce to her
  the untimely death of her son Orestes through an accident during a
  chariot-race at Delphi.

  Arrived at Mycenæ, he found his sister Electra so overwhelmed with
  grief at the news of her brother's death that to her he revealed his
  identity. When he heard from her lips how cruelly she had been treated by
  her mother, and how joyfully the news of his demise had been received,
  his long pent-up passion completely overpowered him, and rushing into the
  presence of the king and queen, he first pierced Clytemnestra to the
  heart, and afterwards her guilty partner.

  But the crime of murdering his own mother was not long unavenged by
  the gods. Hardly was the fatal act committed when the Furies appeared and
  unceasingly pursued the unfortunate Orestes wherever he went. In this
  wretched plight he sought refuge in the temple of Delphi, where he
  earnestly besought Apollo to release him from his cruel tormentors. The
  god commanded him, in expiation of his crime, to repair to
  Taurica-Chersonnesus and convey the statue of Artemis from thence to the
  kingdom of Attica, an expedition fraught with extreme peril. We have
  already seen in a former chapter how Orestes escaped the fate which
  befell all strangers  a
  name="page307">[307]who landed on the Taurian coast, and how,
  with the aid of his sister Iphigenia, the priestess of the temple, he
  succeeded in conveying the statue of the goddess to his native
  country.

  But the Furies did not so easily relinquish their prey, and only by
  means of the interposition of the just and powerful goddess Pallas-Athene
  was Orestes finally liberated from their persecution. His peace of mind
  being at length restored, Orestes assumed the government of the kingdom
  of Argos, and became united to the beautiful Hermione, daughter of Helen
  and Menelaus. On his faithful friend Pylades he bestowed the hand of his
  beloved sister, the good and faithful Electra.

  Homeward Voyage of Odysseus.       With his twelve ships laden
  with enormous treasures, captured during the sacking of Troy, Odysseus
  set sail with a light heart for his rocky island home of Ithaca. At
  length the happy hour had arrived which for ten long years the hero had
  so anxiously awaited, and he little dreamt that ten more must elapse
  before he would be permitted by the Fates to clasp to his heart his
  beloved wife and child.

  During his homeward voyage his little fleet was driven by stress of
  weather to a land whose inhabitants subsisted entirely on a curious plant
  called the lotus, which was sweet as honey to the taste, but had the
  effect of causing utter oblivion of home and country, and of creating an
  irresistible longing to remain for ever in the land of the lotus-eaters.
  Odysseus and his companions were hospitably received by the inhabitants,
  who regaled them freely with their peculiar and very delicious food;
  after partaking of which, however, the comrades of the hero refused to
  leave the country, and it was only by sheer force that he at length
  succeeded in bringing them back to their ships.

  Polyphemus.       Continuing their journey, they next arrived
  at the country of the Cyclops, a race of giants remarkable for having
  only one eye, which was placed in the centre of their foreheads. Here
  Odysseus, whose love of adventure overcame more prudent considerations,
   a
  name="page308">[308]left his fleet safely anchored in the bay
  of a neighbouring island, and with twelve chosen companions set out to
  explore the country.

  Near the shore they found a vast cave, into which they boldly entered.
  In the interior they saw to their surprise huge piles of cheese and great
  pails of milk ranged round the walls. After partaking freely of these
  provisions his companions endeavoured to persuade Odysseus to return to
  the ship; but the hero being curious to make the acquaintance of the
  owner of this extraordinary abode, ordered them to remain and await his
  pleasure.

  Towards evening a fierce giant made his appearance, bearing an
  enormous load of wood upon his shoulders, and driving before him a large
  flock of sheep. This was Polyphemus, the son of Poseidon, the owner of
  the cave. After all his sheep had entered, the giant rolled before the
  entrance to the cave an enormous rock, which the combined strength of a
  hundred men would have been powerless to move.

  Having kindled a fire of great logs of pine-wood he was about to
  prepare his supper when the flames revealed to him, in a corner of the
  cavern, its new occupants, who now came forward and informed him that
  they were shipwrecked mariners, and claimed his hospitality in the name
  of Zeus. But the fierce monster railed at the great ruler of
  Olympus       for the lawless Cyclops knew no fear of the gods       and
  hardly vouchsafed a reply to the demand of the hero. To the consternation
  of Odysseus the giant seized two of his companions, and, after dashing
  them to the ground, consumed their remains, washing down the ghastly meal
  with huge draughts of milk. He then stretched his gigantic limbs on the
  ground, and soon fell fast asleep beside the fire.

  Thinking the opportunity a favourable one to rid himself and his
  companions of their terrible enemy, Odysseus drew his sword, and,
  creeping stealthily forward, was about to slay the giant when he suddenly
  remembered that the aperture of the cave was effectually closed by the
  immense rock, which rendered egress impossible. He  span
  class="pagenum">[309]therefore wisely
  determined to wait until the following day, and set his wits to work in
  the meantime to devise a scheme by which he and his companions might make
  their escape.

  When, early next morning, the giant awoke, two more unfortunate
  companions of the hero were seized by him and devoured; after which
  Polyphemus leisurely drove out his flock, taking care to secure the
  entrance of the cave as before.

  Next evening the giant devoured two more of his victims, and when he
  had finished his revolting meal Odysseus stepped forward and presented
  him with a large measure of wine which he had brought with him from his
  ship in a goat's skin. Delighted with the delicious beverage the giant
  inquired the name of the donor. Odysseus replied that his name was Noman,
  whereupon Polyphemus, graciously announced that he would evince his
  gratitude by eating him the last.

  The monster, thoroughly overcome with the powerful old liquor, soon
  fell into a heavy sleep, and Odysseus lost no time in putting his plans
  into execution. He had cut during the day a large piece of the giant's
  own olive-staff, which he now heated in the fire, and, aided by his
  companions, thrust it into the eye-ball of Polyphemus, and in this manner
  effectually blinded him.

  The giant made the cave resound with his howls of pain and rage. His
  cries being heard by his brother Cyclops, who lived in caves not far
  distant from his own, they soon came trooping over the hills from all
  sides, and assailed the door of the cave with inquiries concerning the
  cause of his cries and groans. But as his only reply was, "Noman has
  injured me," they concluded that he had been playing them a trick, and
  therefore abandoned him to his fate.

  The blinded giant now groped vainly round his cave in hopes of laying
  hands on some of his tormentors; but wearied at length of these fruitless
  exertions he rolled away the rock which closed the aperture, thinking
  that his victims would rush out with the sheep, when it would  !-- Page
  310 -->[310]be an easy
  matter to capture them. But in the meantime Odysseus had not been idle,
  and the subtlety of the hero was now brought into play, and proved more
  than a match for the giant's strength. The sheep were very large, and
  Odysseus, with bands of willow taken from the bed of Polyphemus, had
  cleverly linked them together three abreast, and under each centre one
  had secured one of his comrades. After providing for the safety of his
  companions, Odysseus himself selected the finest ram of the flock, and,
  by clinging to the wool of the animal, made his escape. As the sheep
  passed out of the cave the giant felt carefully among them for his
  victims, but not finding them on the backs of the animals he let them
  pass, and thus they all escaped.

  They now hastened on board their vessel, and Odysseus, thinking
  himself at a safe distance, shouted out his real name and mockingly
  defied the giant; whereupon Polyphemus seized a huge rock, and, following
  the direction of the voice, hurled it towards the ship, which narrowly
  escaped destruction. He then called upon his father Poseidon to avenge
  him, entreating him to curse Odysseus with a long and tedious voyage, to
  destroy all his ships and all his companions, and to make his return as
  late, as unhappy, and as desolate as possible.

  Further Adventures.       After sailing about over unknown seas
  for some time the hero and his followers cast anchor at the island of
  Æolus, king of the Winds, who welcomed them cordially, and sumptuously
  entertained them for a whole month.

  When they took their leave he gave Odysseus the skin of an ox, into
  which he had placed all the contrary winds in order to insure to them a
  safe and speedy voyage, and then, having cautioned him on no account to
  open it, caused the gentle Zephyrus to blow so that he might waft them to
  the shores of Greece.

  On the evening of the tenth day after their departure they arrived in
  sight of the watch-fires of Ithaca. But here, unfortunately, Odysseus,
  being completely wearied  a
  name="page311">[311]out, fell asleep, and his comrades,
  thinking Æolus had given him a treasure in the bag which he so sedulously
  guarded, seized this opportunity of opening it, whereupon all the adverse
  winds rushed out, and drove them back to the Æolian island. This time,
  however, Æolus did not welcome them as before, but dismissed them with
  bitter reproaches and upbraidings for their disregard of his
  injunctions.

  After a six days' voyage they at length sighted land. Observing what
  appeared to be the smoke from a large town, Odysseus despatched a herald,
  accompanied by two of his comrades, in order to procure provisions. When
  they arrived in the city they discovered to their consternation that they
  had set foot in the land of the Læstrygones, a race of fierce and
  gigantic cannibals, governed by their king Antiphates. The unfortunate
  herald was seized and killed by the king; but his two companions, who
  took to flight, succeeded in reaching their ship in safety, and urgently
  entreated their chief to put to sea without delay.

  But Antiphates and his fellow-giants pursued the fugitives to the
  sea-shore, where they now appeared in large numbers. They seized huge
  rocks, which they hurled upon the fleet, sinking eleven of the ships with
  all hands, on board; the vessel under the immediate command of Odysseus
  being the only one which escaped destruction. In this ship, with his few
  remaining followers, Odysseus now set sail, but was driven by adverse
  winds to an island called Ææa.

  Circe.       The hero and his companions were in sore need of
  provisions, but, warned by previous disasters, Odysseus resolved that
  only a certain number of the ship's crew should be despatched to
  reconnoitre the country; and on lots being drawn by Odysseus and
  Eurylochus, it fell to the share of the latter to fill the office of
  conductor to the little band selected for this purpose.

  They soon came to a magnificent marble palace, which was situated in a
  charming and fertile valley. Here  span
  class="pagenum">[312]dwelt a beautiful
  enchantress called Circe, daughter of the sun-god and the sea-nymph
  Perse. The entrance to her abode was guarded by wolves and lions, who,
  however, to the great surprise of the strangers, were tame and harmless
  as lambs. These were, in fact, human beings who, by the wicked arts of
  the sorceress, had been thus transformed. From within they heard the
  enchanting voice of the goddess, who was singing a sweet melody as she
  sat at her work, weaving a web such as immortals alone could produce. She
  graciously invited them to enter, and all save the prudent and cautious
  Eurylochus accepted the invitation.

  As they trod the wide and spacious halls of tesselated marble objects
  of wealth and beauty met their view on all sides. The soft and luxuriant
  couches on which she bade them be seated were studded with silver, and
  the banquet which she provided for their refreshment was served in
  vessels of pure gold. But while her unsuspecting guests were abandoning
  themselves to the pleasures of the table the wicked enchantress was
  secretly working their ruin; for the wine-cup which was presented to them
  was drugged with a potent draught, after partaking of which the sorceress
  touched them with her magic wand, and they were immediately transformed
  into swine, still, however, retaining their human senses.

  When Odysseus heard from Eurylochus of the terrible fate which had
  befallen his companions he set out, regardless of personal danger,
  resolved to make an effort to rescue them. On his way to the palace of
  the sorceress he met a fair youth bearing a wand of gold, who revealed
  himself to him as Hermes, the divine messenger of the gods. He gently
  reproached the hero for his temerity in venturing to enter the abode of
  Circe unprovided with an antidote against her spells, and presented him
  with a peculiar herb called Moly, assuring him that it would inevitably
  counteract the baneful arts of the fell enchantress. Hermes warned
  Odysseus that Circe would offer him a draught of drugged wine with the
  intention of transforming him as she had done his companions. He bade him
  drink the wine, the effect of  a
  name="page313">[313]which would be completely nullified by the
  herb which he had given him, and then rush boldly at the sorceress as
  though he would take her life, whereupon her power over him would cease,
  she would recognize her master, and grant him whatever he might
  desire.

  Circe received the hero with all the grace and fascination at her
  command, and presented him with a draught of wine in a golden goblet.
  This he readily accepted, trusting to the efficacy of the antidote. Then,
  in obedience to the injunction of Hermes, he drew his sword from its
  scabbard and rushed upon the sorceress as though he would slay her.

  When Circe found that her fell purpose was for the first time
  frustrated, and that a mortal had dared to attack her, she knew that it
  must be the great Odysseus who stood before her, whose visit to her abode
  had been foretold to her by Hermes. At his solicitation she restored to
  his companions their human form, promising at the same time that
  henceforth the hero and his comrades should be free from her
  enchantments.

  But all warnings and past experience were forgotten by Odysseus when
  Circe commenced to exercise upon him her fascinations and blandishments.
  At her request his companions took up their abode in the island, and he
  himself became the guest and slave of the enchantress for a whole year;
  and it was only at the earnest admonition of his friends that he was at
  length induced to free himself from her toils.

  Circe had become so attached to the gallant hero that it cost her a
  great effort to part with him, but having vowed not to exercise her magic
  spells against him she was powerless to detain him further. The goddess
  now warned him that his future would be beset with many dangers, and
  commanded him to consult the blind old seer Tiresias, a name="NtA_52"
  href="#Nt_52">[52] in the realm of Hades, concerning his
  future destiny. She then loaded his ship with provisions for the voyage,
  and reluctantly bade him farewell.

[314]

  The Realm of Shades.       Though somewhat appalled at the
  prospect of seeking the weird and gloomy realms inhabited by the spirits
  of the dead, Odysseus nevertheless obeyed the command of the goddess, who
  gave him full directions with regard to his course, and also certain
  injunctions which it was important that he should carry out with strict
  attention to detail.

  He accordingly set sail with his companions for the dark and gloomy
  land of the Cimmerians, which lay at the furthermost end of the world,
  beyond the great stream Oceanus. Favoured by gentle breezes they soon
  reached their destination in the far west. On arriving at the spot
  indicated by Circe, where the turbid waters of the rivers Acheron and
  Cocytus mingled at the entrance to the lower world, Odysseus landed,
  unattended by his companions.

  Having dug a trench to receive the blood of the sacrifices he now
  offered a black ram and ewe to the powers of darkness, whereupon crowds
  of shades rose up from the yawning gulf, clustering round him, eager to
  quaff the blood of the sacrifice, which would restore to them for a time
  their mental vigour. But mindful of the injunction of Circe, Odysseus
  brandished his sword, and suffered none to approach until Tiresias had
  appeared. The great prophet now came slowly forward leaning on his golden
  staff, and after drinking of the sacrifice proceeded to impart to
  Odysseus the hidden secrets of his future fate. Tiresias also warned him
  of the numerous perils which would assail him, not only during his
  homeward voyage but also on his return to Ithaca, and then instructed him
  how to avoid them.

  Meanwhile numbers of other shades had quaffed the sense-awakening
  draught of the sacrifice, among whom Odysseus recognized to his dismay
  his tenderly-loved mother Anticlea. From her he learned that she had died
  of grief at her son's protracted absence, and that his aged father
  Laertes was wearing his life away in vain and anxious longings for his
  return. He also conversed with the ill-fated Agamemnon, Patroclus, and
  Achilles. The latter  a
  name="page315">[315]bemoaned his shadowy and unreal existence,
  and plaintively assured his former companion-in-arms that rather would he
  be the poorest day-labourer on earth than reign supreme as king over the
  realm of shades. Ajax alone, who still brooded over his wrongs, held
  aloof, refusing to converse with Odysseus, and sullenly retired when the
  hero addressed him.

  But at last so many shades came swarming round him that the courage of
  Odysseus failed him, and he fled in terror back to his ship. Having
  rejoined his companions they once more put to sea, and proceeded on their
  homeward voyage.

  The Sirens.       After some days' sail their course led them
  past the island of the Sirens.

  Now Circe had warned Odysseus on no account to listen to the seductive
  melodies of these treacherous nymphs; for that all who gave ear to their
  enticing strains felt an unconquerable desire to leap overboard and join
  them, when they either perished at their hands, or were engulfed by the
  waves.

  In order that his crew should not hear the song of the Sirens,
  Odysseus had filled their ears with melted wax; but the hero himself so
  dearly loved adventure that he could not resist the temptation of braving
  this new danger. By his own desire, therefore, he was lashed to the mast,
  and his comrades had strict orders on no account to release him until
  they were out of sight of the island, no matter how he might implore them
  to set him free.

  As they neared the fatal shore they beheld the Sirens seated side by
  side on the verdant slopes of their island; and as their sweet and
  alluring strains fell upon his ear the hero became so powerfully affected
  by them, that, forgetful of all danger, he entreated his comrades to
  release him; but the sailors, obedient to their orders, refused to unbind
  him until the enchanted island had disappeared from view. The danger
  past, the hero gratefully acknowledged the firmness of his followers,
  which had been the means of saving his life.  span
  class="pagenum">[316]

  The Island of Helios.       They now approached the terrible
  dangers of Scylla and Charybdis, between which Circe had desired them to
  pass. As Odysseus steered the vessel beneath the great rock, Scylla
  swooped down and seized six of his crew from the deck, and the cries of
  her wretched victims long rang in his ears. At length they reached the
  island of Trinacria (Sicily), whereon the sun-god pastured his flocks and
  herds, and Odysseus, calling to mind the warning of Tiresias to avoid
  this sacred island, would fain have steered the vessel past and left the
  country unexplored. But his crew became mutinous, and insisted on
  landing. Odysseus was therefore obliged to yield, but before allowing
  them to set foot on shore he made them take an oath not to touch the
  sacred herds of Helios, and to be ready to sail again on the following
  morning.

  It happened, unfortunately, however, that stress of weather compelled
  them to remain a whole month at Trinacria, and the store of wine and food
  given to them by Circe at parting being completely exhausted, they were
  obliged to subsist on what fish and birds the island afforded. Frequently
  there was not sufficient to satisfy their hunger, and one evening when
  Odysseus, worn out with anxiety and fatigue, had fallen asleep,
  Eurylochus persuaded the hungry men to break their vows and kill some of
  the sacred oxen.

  Dreadful was the anger of Helios, who caused the hides of the
  slaughtered animals to creep and the joints on the spits to bellow like
  living cattle, and threatened that unless Zeus punished the impious crew
  he would withdraw his light from the heavens and shine only in Hades.
  Anxious to appease the enraged deity Zeus assured him that his cause
  should be avenged. When, therefore, after feasting for seven days
  Odysseus and his companions again set sail, the ruler of Olympus caused a
  terrible storm to overtake them, during which the ship was struck with
  lightning and went to pieces. All the crew were drowned except Odysseus,
  who, clinging to a mast, floated about in the open sea for nine days,
  when, after once more  a
  name="page317">[317]escaping being sucked in by the whirlpool
  of Charybdis, he was cast ashore on the island of Ogygia.

  Calypso.       Ogygia was an island covered with dense forests,
  where, in the midst of a grove of cypress and poplar, stood the charming
  grotto-palace of the nymph Calypso, daughter of the Titan Atlas. The
  entrance to the grotto was entwined with a leafy trellis-work of
  vine-branches, from which depended clusters of purple and golden grapes;
  the plashing of fountains gave a delicious sense of coolness to the air,
  which was filled with the songs of birds, and the ground was carpeted
  with violets and mosses.

  Calypso cordially welcomed the forlorn and shipwrecked hero, and
  hospitably ministered to his wants. In the course of time she became so
  greatly attached to him that she offered him immortality and eternal
  youth if he would consent to remain with her for ever. But the heart of
  Odysseus turned yearningly towards his beloved wife Penelope and his
  young son. He therefore refused the boon, and earnestly entreated the
  gods to permit him to revisit his home. But the curse of Poseidon still
  followed the unfortunate hero, and for seven long years he was detained
  on the island by Calypso, sorely against his will.

  At length Pallas-Athene interceded with her mighty father on his
  behalf, and Zeus, yielding to her request, forthwith despatched the
  fleet-footed Hermes to Calypso, commanding her to permit Odysseus to
  depart and to provide him with the means of transport.

  The goddess, though loath to part with her guest, dared not disobey
  the commands of the mighty Zeus. She therefore instructed the hero how to
  construct a raft, for which she herself wove the sails. Odysseus now bade
  her farewell, and alone and unaided embarked on the frail little craft
  for his native land.

  Nausicaa.       For seventeen days Odysseus contrived to pilot
  the raft skilfully through all the perils of the deep, directing his
  course according to the directions  span
  class="pagenum">[318]of Calypso, and guided
  by the stars of heaven. On the eighteenth day he joyfully hailed the
  distant outline of the Phæacian coast, and began to look forward
  hopefully to temporary rest and shelter. But Poseidon, still enraged with
  the hero who had blinded and insulted his son, caused an awful tempest to
  arise, during which the raft was swamped by the waves, and Odysseus only
  saved himself by clinging for bare life to a portion of the wreck.

  For two days and nights he floated about, drifted hither and thither
  by the angry billows, till at last, after many a narrow escape of his
  life, the sea-goddess Leucothea came to his aid, and he was cast ashore
  on the coast of Scheria, the island of the luxurious Phæaces. Worn out
  with the hardships and dangers he had passed through he crept into a
  thicket for security, and, lying down on a bed of dried leaves, soon fell
  fast asleep.

  It chanced that Nausicaa, the beautiful daughter of king Alcinous and
  his queen Arete, had come down to the shore, accompanied by her maidens,
  to wash the linen which was destined to form part of her marriage
  portion. When they had finished their task they bathed and sat down to a
  repast, after which they amused themselves with singing and playing at
  ball.

  Their joyous shouts at last awoke Odysseus, who, rising from his
  hiding place, suddenly found himself in the midst of the happy group.
  Alarmed at his wild aspect the attendants of Nausicaa fled in terror; but
  the princess, pitying the forlorn condition of the stranger, addressed
  him with kind and sympathetic words. After hearing from him the account
  of his shipwreck and the terrible hardships he had undergone, Nausicaa
  called back her attendants, reproached them for their want of courtesy,
  and bade them supply the wanderer with food, drink, and suitable raiment.
  Odysseus then left the maidens to resume their games, whilst he bathed
  and clothed himself with the garments with which they had furnished him.
  Athene now appeared to the hero and endowed him with a commanding and
  magnificent stature, and with more than mortal beauty. When he
  reappeared, the young  a
  name="page319">[319]princess was struck with admiration, and
  requested the hero to visit the palace of her father. She then desired
  her attendants to yoke the mules to the wagons and prepare to return
  home.

  Odysseus was cordially received by the king and queen, who entertained
  him with magnificent hospitality, and in return for their kindness the
  hero related to them the history of his long and eventful voyage, and the
  many extraordinary adventures and miraculous escapes which had befallen
  him since his departure from the coast of Ilion.

  When he at last took leave of his royal entertainers Alcinous loaded
  him with rich gifts, and ordered him to be conveyed in one of his own
  ships to Ithaca.

  Arrival at Ithaca.       The voyage was a short and prosperous
  one. By the direction of king Alcinous rich furs had been laid on deck
  for the comfort of his guest, on which the hero, leaving the guidance of
  the ship to the Phæacian sailors, soon fell into a deep sleep. When next
  morning the vessel arrived in the harbour of Ithaca the sailors,
  concluding that so unusually profound a slumber must be sent by the gods,
  conveyed him on shore without disturbing him, where they gently placed
  him beneath the cool shade of an olive-tree.

  When Odysseus awoke he knew not where he was, for his ever-watchful
  protectress Pallas-Athene had enveloped him in a thick cloud in order to
  conceal him from view. She now appeared to him in the disguise of a
  shepherd, and informed him that he was in his native land; that his
  father Laertes, bent with sorrow and old age, had withdrawn from the
  court; that his son Telemachus had grown to manhood, and was gone to seek
  for tidings of his father; and that his wife Penelope was harassed by the
  importunities of numerous suitors, who had taken possession of his home
  and devoured his substance. In order to gain time Penelope had promised
  to marry one of her lovers as soon as she had finished weaving a robe for
  the aged Laertes; but by secretly undoing at night  span
  class="pagenum">[320]what she had done in
  the day she effectually retarded the completion of the work, and thus
  deferred her final reply. Just as Odysseus had set foot in Ithaca the
  angry suitors had discovered her stratagem, and had become in consequence
  more clamorous than ever. When the hero heard that this was indeed his
  native land, which, after an absence of twenty years, the gods had at
  length permitted him to behold once more, he threw himself on the ground,
  and kissed it in an ecstacy of joy.

  The goddess, who had meanwhile revealed her identity to Odysseus, now
  assisted him to conceal in a neighbouring cave the valuable gifts of the
  Phæacian king. Then seating herself beside him she consulted with him as
  to the best means of ridding his palace of its shameless occupants.

  In order to prevent his being recognized she caused him to assume the
  form of an aged mendicant. His limbs became decrepid, his brown locks
  vanished, his eyes grew dim and bleared, and the regal robes given to him
  by king Alcinous were replaced by a tattered garb of dingy hue, which
  hung loosely round his shrunken form. Athene then desired him to seek
  shelter in the hut of Eumæus his own swine-herd.

  Eumæus received the old beggar hospitably, kindly ministered to his
  wants, and even confided to him his distress at the long continued
  absence of his beloved old master, and his regrets at being compelled by
  the unruly invaders of his house, to slaughter for their use all the
  finest and fattest of the herd.

  It chanced that the following morning Telemachus returned from his
  long and fruitless search for his father, and going first to the hut of
  Eumæus, heard from him the story of the seeming beggar whom he promised
  to befriend. Athene now urged Odysseus to make himself known to his son;
  and at her touch his beggar's rags disappeared, and he stood before
  Telemachus arrayed in royal robes and in the full strength and vigour of
  manhood. So imposing was the appearance of the hero that at first the
  young prince thought he must be a god; but when  span
  class="pagenum">[321]he was convinced that
  it was indeed his beloved father, whose prolonged absence had caused him
  so much grief, he fell upon his neck and embraced him with every
  expression of dutiful affection.

  Odysseus charged Telemachus to keep his return a secret, and concerted
  with him a plan whereby they might rid themselves of the detested
  suitors. In order to carry it into effect Telemachus was to induce his
  mother to promise her hand to the one who could conquer in shooting with
  the famous bow of Odysseus, which the hero had left behind when he went
  to Troy, deeming it too precious a treasure to be taken with him.
  Odysseus now resumed his beggar's dress and appearance and accompanied
  his son to the palace, before the door of which lay his faithful dog
  Argo, who, though worn and feeble with age and neglect, instantly
  recognized his master. In his delight the poor animal made a last effort
  to welcome him; but his strength was exhausted, and he expired at his
  feet.

  When Odysseus entered his ancestral halls he was mocked and reviled by
  the riotous suitors, and Antinous, the most shameless of them all,
  ridiculed his abject appearance, and insolently bade him depart; but
  Penelope hearing of their cruel conduct, was touched with compassion, and
  desired her maidens to bring the poor mendicant into her presence. She
  spoke kindly to him, inquiring who he was and whence he came. He told her
  that he was the brother of the king of Crete, in whose palace he had seen
  Odysseus, who was about starting for Ithaca, and had declared his
  intention of arriving there before the year was out. The queen, overjoyed
  at the happy tidings, ordered her maidens to prepare a bed for the
  stranger, and to treat him as an honoured guest. She then desired the old
  nurse Euryclea to provide him with suitable raiment and to attend to all
  his wants.

  As the old servant was bathing his feet her eyes fell upon a scar
  which Odysseus had received in his youth from the tusks of a wild boar;
  and instantly recognizing the beloved master whom she had nursed as a
  babe, she  a
  name="page322">[322]would have cried aloud in her joy, but the
  hero placing his hand upon her mouth, implored her not to betray him.

  The next day was a festival of Apollo, and the suitors in honour of
  the occasion feasted with more than their accustomed revelry. After the
  banquet was over Penelope, taking down the great bow of Odysseus from its
  place, entered the hall and declared that whosoever of her lovers could
  bend it and send an arrow through twelve rings (a feat which she had
  often seen Odysseus perform) should be chosen by her as her husband.

  All the suitors tried their skill, but in vain; not one possessed the
  strength required to draw the bow. Odysseus now stepped forward and asked
  permission to be allowed to try, but the haughty nobles mocked at his
  audacity, and would not have permitted it had not Telemachus interfered.
  The pretended beggar took up the bow, and with the greatest ease sent an
  arrow whizzing through the rings; then turning to Antinous, who was just
  raising a goblet of wine to his lips, he pierced him to the heart. At
  this the suitors sprang to their feet and looked round for their arms;
  but in obedience to the instructions of Odysseus Telemachus had
  previously removed them. He and his father now attacked the riotous
  revellers, and after a desperate encounter not one of the whole crew
  remained alive.

  The joyful intelligence of the return of Odysseus being conveyed to
  Penelope she descended to the hall, but refused to recognize, in the aged
  beggar, her gallant husband; whereupon he retired to the bath, from which
  he emerged in all the vigour and beauty with which Athene had endowed him
  at the court of Alcinous. But Penelope, still incredulous, determined to
  put him to a sure test. She therefore commanded in his hearing that his
  own bed should be brought from his chamber. Now the foot of this bed had
  been fashioned by Odysseus himself out of the stem of an olive-tree which
  was still rooted in the ground, and round it he had built the walls of
  the chamber. Knowing therefore that the bed could not be moved, he
  exclaimed that the errand was useless, for that no  span
  class="pagenum">[323]mortal could stir it
  from its place. Then Penelope knew that it must be Odysseus himself who
  stood before her, and a most touching and affectionate meeting took place
  between the long-separated husband and wife.

  The following day the hero set out to seek his old father Laertes,
  whom he found on one of his estates in the country engaged in digging up
  a young olive-tree. The poor old man, who was dressed in the humble garb
  of a labourer, bore the traces of deep grief on his furrowed countenance,
  and so shocked was his son at the change in his appearance that for a
  moment he turned aside to conceal his tears.

  When Odysseus revealed himself to his father as the son whom he had so
  long mourned as lost, the joy of the poor old man was almost greater than
  he could bear. With loving care Odysseus led him into the house, where at
  length, for the first time since the departure of his son, Laertes once
  more resumed his regal robes, and piously thanked the gods for this great
  and unlooked-for happiness.

  But not yet was the hero permitted to enjoy his well-earned repose,
  for the friends and relatives of the suitors now rose in rebellion
  against him and pursued him to the abode of his father. The struggle,
  however, was but a short one. After a brief contest negotiations of a
  peaceful nature were entered into between Odysseus and his subjects.
  Recognizing the justice of his cause, they became reconciled to their
  chief, who for many years continued to reign over them.

PRONOUNCING INDEX.



  [Note.       The system of pronunciation here followed is the
  English system, because it is the one at present most used among
  English-speaking peoples. In it the letters have substantially their
  English sound. Upon the continent of Europe the pronunciation of Latin
  and Greek is in like manner made to correspond in each nation to the
  pronunciation of its own language, and thus there is much diversity among
  the continental systems, though they resemble each other more closely
  than they do the English. In England and America also the continental
  methods of pronunciation have been extensively used. Thus Æneas may be
  pronounced A-na´-ahss; Aïdes ah-ee´-daze. Since the true, the ancient,
  pronunciation has been lost, and, as many contend, cannot be even
  substantially recovered, it is a matter of individual preference what
  system shall be followed.]

  In the preparation of this series the authors have had one object
  clearly in view       to so develop the study of the English language as
  to present a complete, progressive course, from the Spelling-Book to the
  study of English Literature. The troublesome contradictions which arise
  in using books arranged by different authors on these subjects, and which
  require much time for explanation in the schoolroom, will be avoided by
  the use of the above "Complete Course."

  Teachers are earnestly invited to examine these books.

NOTES


  [1] The early Greeks supposed the
  earth to be a flat circle, in the centre of which was Greece. Oceanus,
  the ocean stream, encircled it; the Mediterranean being supposed to flow
  into this river on the one side, and the Euxine, or Black Sea, on the
  other.

  [2] Owing to the vagueness of the
  various accounts of creation, the origin of the primeval gods is
  variously accounted for. Thus, for instance, Oceanus, with some, becomes
  the younger brother of Uranus and Gæa.

  [3] The myth of Cronus swallowing his
  children is evidently intended by the poets to express the melancholy
  truth that time destroys all things.

  [4] Nectar was the drink, and
  ambrosia the food of the gods.

  [5] The Cyclops are generally
  mentioned as the sons of Uranus and Gæa, but Homer speaks of Polyphemus,
  the chief of the Cyclops, as the son of Poseidon, and states the Cyclops
  to be his brothers.

  [6] Possibly an image of him placed
  in readiness.

  [7] This age was contemporary with
  the commencement of the dynasty of Zeus.

  [8] Hesiod is said to have lived 850
  years before the Christian era, consequently about 200 years after King
  David. He lived in B       otia, where his tomb is still shown at
  Orchomenus. This ancient writer left behind him two great poems, one
  entitled "The Works and Days," in which he gives us some of the earliest
  Greek legends, and the other, "The Theogony," containing the genealogies
  of the gods; but, unfortunately, both these poems have been so
  interpolated by the writers of the Alexandrian school that they have lost
  their value as reliable sources of information with regard to the early
  beliefs of the Greek nation.

  [9] Epimetheus signifies
  after-thought, Prometheus fore-thought.

  [10] There are various versions of
  this myth. According to some the jar or vase was full of all "the ills
  which flesh is heir to."

  [11] From Diaus, the
  sky.

  [12] A sacred shield made for Zeus
  by Hephæstus, which derived its name from being covered by the skin of
  the goat Amalthea, the word Ægis signifying goat's-skin.

  [13] See Demeter.

  [14] This frightful monster had
  sprung from the slimy and stagnant waters which remained on the surface
  of the earth after the deluge of Deucalion.

  [15] Castor and Pollux were known
  by the name of the Dioscuri, from dios, gods, and kuroi,
  youths.

  [16] The ancient Greeks attributed
  much of the subsequent character of an individual to early influences;
  hence Hera, the future queen and mistress of heaven, is represented as
  being brought up in a domesticated and orderly household, where home
  virtues are carefully inculcated.

  [17] In the Homeric age peacocks
  were unknown; it is therefore the later poets who describe Hera
  surrounded with peacocks, which were brought to Greece from India.

  [18] This circumstance has given
  rise to the erroneous conclusion that Juno presided over the finances of
  the state, but the word moneta is derived from the Latin
  monere, which means to warn or admonish.

  [19] See Roman Festivals.

  [20] The first large ship possessed
  by the Greeks fit for more than coast navigation.

  [21] When Perseus, with the help of
  Athene, had cut off the head of the Medusa, the two sisters caused a sad
  dirge-like song to issue from the mouths of the many snakes of which
  their hair was composed, whereupon Athene, pleased with the sound,
  imitated the melody on a reed, and thus invented the flute.

  [22] For details see Roman
  Festivals.

  [23] See Legend of Troy.

  [24] Some, with but little reason,
  make Demeter the daughter of Uranus and Gæa.

  [25] Demeter transformed Ascalaphus
  into an owl for revealing the secret.

  [26] The course which the sun ran
  was considered by the ancients to be a rising and descending curve  img
  src="images/0062-1.png" alt="arc" style="height:1ex" /> the centre of
  which was supposed to be reached by Helios at mid-day.

  [27] The river Po.

  [28] This great work of antiquity
  was destroyed by an earthquake fifty-six years after its erection,  span
  class="scac">B.C. 256. The fragments remained on the ground for
  many centuries, until Rhodes was conquered by the Turks, and they were
  eventually sold by one of the generals of Caliph Othman IV. to a merchant
  of Emesa for £36,000, A.D. 672.

  [29] According to some authorities,
  Strymon.

  [30] This wonderful lyre, which had
  been given to Apollo by Hermes (Mercury) in exchange for the Caduceus or
  rod of wealth, is said to have possessed such extraordinary powers, that
  it caused a stone, upon which it was laid, to become so melodious, that
  ever afterwards, on being touched, it emitted a musical sound which
  resembled that produced by the lyre itself.

  [31] Aristæus was worshipped as a
  rural divinity in various parts of Greece, and was supposed to have
  taught mankind how to catch bees, and to utilize honey and wax.

  [32] Astræa was the daughter of the
  Titans C       us and Ph       be. Perses was son of the Titans Crios and
  Eurybia.

  [33] Called also
  Anaitis-Aphroditis.

  [34] This occurred during the night
  Alexander the Great was born.

  [35] Another version with regard to
  the origin of this defect, is that being born ugly and deformed, his
  mother Hera, disgusted at his unsightliness, herself threw him violently
  from her lap, and it was then that his leg was broken, producing the
  lameness from which he suffered ever after. On this occasion he fell into
  the sea, and was saved by the sea-nymphs Thetis and Eurynome, who kept
  him for nine years in a cavern beneath the ocean, where he made for them,
  in gratitude for their kindness, several beautiful ornaments, and
  trinkets of rare workmanship.

  [36] According to some accounts
  Chares was the wife of Hephæstus.

  [37] The trident resembled the
  arrow-headed pronged fork, used by the fishermen of the Mediterranean Sea
  in the eel-fishery.

  [38] Scylla is a dangerous rock,
  much dreaded by mariners, in the Straits of Messina.

  [39] The island of Rhodes owes its
  name to her.

  [40] It is worthy of notice that
  the sons of Poseidon were, for the most part, distinguished by great
  force and turbulence of character, in keeping with the element over which
  their father was the presiding deity. They were giants in power, and
  intractable, fiery, and impatient by nature, spurning all efforts to
  control them; in all respects, therefore, fitting representatives of
  their progenitor, the mighty ruler of the sea.

  [41] A cubit is the length from the
  elbow to the extremity of the middle finger, and therefore an indefinite
  measure, but modern usage takes it as representing a length of seventeen
  to eighteen inches.

  [42] On the Egyptian coast.

  [43] See Legend of the
  Argonauts.

  [44] His two sons Deimos and
  Phobos.

  [45] Romulus was deified by the
  Romans after death, and was worshipped by them under the name of
  Quirinus, an appellation which he shared in common with his father
  Mars.

  [46] Midas was the son of Cybele
  and Gordius, the king who tied the celebrated and intricate knot.

  [47] The shades of those mortals
  whose lives had neither been distinguished by virtue nor vice, were
  condemned to a monotonous, joyless, existence in the Asphodel meadows of
  Hades.

  [48] Echidna was a bloodthirsty
  monster, half maiden, half serpent.

  [49] One of the horns of the goat
  Amalthea, broken off by Zeus, and supposed to possess the power of
  filling itself with whatsoever its owner desired.

  [50] According to another account,
  Momus discovered that Aphrodite made a noise when she walked.

  [51] The word Psyche signifies
  "butterfly," the emblem of the soul in ancient art.

  [52] Tiresias alone, of all the
  shades, was in full possession of his mental vigour.

  [53] Most of the words ending in
  eus may also be pronounced thus: Æ´-ge-us,        ´-tre-us,
  pro-me´-the-us, etc.

  [54] The first e like ei in
  their.

  [55] Th at the beginning of
  a word has its soft sound, as in both.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
