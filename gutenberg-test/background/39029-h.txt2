741
HORTICULTURE (Lat. hortus, a garden), the art and science
of the cultivation of garden plants, whether for utilitarian or
for decorative purposes. The subject naturally divides itself
into two sections, which we here propose to treat separately,
commencing with the science, and passing on to the practice
of the cultivation of flowers, fruits and vegetables as applicable
to the home garden. The point of view taken is necessarily,
as a rule, that of a British gardener.

Part I.&mdash;Principles or Science of Horticulture

Horticulture, apart from the mechanical details connected
with the maintenance of a garden and its appurtenances, may
be considered as the application of the principles of plant physiology
to the cultivation of plants from all parts of the globe,
and from various altitudes, soils and situations. The lessons
derived from the abstract principles enunciated by the physiologist,
the chemist and the physicist require, however, to be
modified to suit the special circumstances of plants under cultivation.
The necessity for this modification arises from the fact
that such plants are subjected to conditions more or less unnatural
to them, and that they are grown for special purposes
which are at variance, in degree at any rate, with their natural
requirements.

The life of the plant (see Plants) makes itself manifest in
the processes of growth, development and reproduction. By
growth is here meant mere increase in bulk, and by development
the series of gradual modifications by which a plant,
originally simple in its structure and conformation, becomes
eventually complicated, and endowed with distinct parts or
organs. The reproduction of the higher plants takes place
either asexually by the formation of buds or organs answering
thereto, or sexually by the production of an embryo plant
within the seed. The conditions requisite for the growth,
development and reproduction of plants are, in general terms,
exposure, at the proper time, to suitable amounts of light, heat
and moisture, and a due supply of appropriate food. The
various amounts of these needed in different cases have to be
adjusted by the gardener, according to the nature of the plant,
its &ldquo;habit&rdquo; or general mode of growth in its native country,
and the influence to which it is there subjected, as also in accordance
with the purposes for which it is to be cultivated, &amp;c.
It is but rarely that direct information on all these points can be
obtained; but inference from previous experience, especially
with regard to allied forms, will go far to supply such deficiencies.
Moreover, it must be remembered that the conditions most
favourable to plants are not always those to which they are
subjected in nature, for, owing to the competition of other
forms in the struggle for existence, liability to injury from
insects, and other adverse circumstances, plants may actually
be excluded from the localities best suited for their development.
The gardener therefore may, and does, by modifying, improve
upon the conditions under which a plant naturally exists. Thus
it frequently happens that in our gardens flowers have a beauty
742
and a fragrance, and fruits a size and savour denied to them
in their native haunts. It behooves the judicious gardener,
then, not to be too slavish in his attempts to imitate natural
conditions, and to bear in mind that such attempts sometimes
end in failure. The most successful gardening is that which
turns to the best account the plastic organization of the plant,
and enables it to develop and multiply as perfectly as possible.
Experience, coupled with observation and reflection, as well
as the more indirect teachings of tradition, are therefore of
primary importance to the practical gardener.

We propose here to notice briefly the several parts of a flowering
plant, and to point out the rationale of the cultural procedures
connected with them (see the references to separate articles
at the end of article on Botany).


The Root.&mdash;The root, though not precluded from access of air,
is not directly dependent for its growth on the agency of light.
The efficiency of drainage, digging, hoeing and like operations is
accounted for by the manner in which they promote aeration of
the soil, raise its temperature and remove its stagnant water. Owing
to their growth in length at, or rather in the immediate vicinity of,
their tips, roots are enabled to traverse long distances by surmounting
some obstacles, penetrating others, and insinuating themselves
into narrow crevices. As they have no power of absorbing solid
materials, their food must be of a liquid or gaseous character.
It is taken up from the interstices between the particles of soil
exclusively by the finest subdivisions of the fibrils, and in many
cases by the extremely delicate thread-like cells which project from
them and which are known as root-hairs. The importance of the
root-fibres, or &ldquo;feeding roots&rdquo; justifies the care which is taken by
every good gardener to secure their fullest development, and to
prevent as far as possible any injury to them in digging, potting
and transplanting, such operations being therefore least prejudicial
at seasons when the plant is in a state of comparative rest.

Root-Pruning and Lifting.&mdash;In apparent disregard of the general
rule just enunciated is the practice of root-pruning fruit trees,
when, from the formation of wood being more active than that of
fruit, they bear badly. The contrariety is more apparent than real,
as the operation consists in the removal of the coarser roots, a
process which results in the development of a mass of fine feeding
roots. Moreover, there is a generally recognised quasi-antagonism
between the vegetative and reproductive processes, so that, other
things being equal, anything that checks the one helps forward
the other.

Watering.&mdash;So far as practical gardening is concerned, feeding
by the roots after they have been placed in suitable soil is confined
principally to the administration of water and, under certain circumstances,
of liquid or chemical manure; and no operations
demand more judicious management. The amount of water required,
and the times when it should be applied, vary greatly
according to the kind of plant and the object for which it is grown,
the season, the supply of heat and light, and numerous other conditions,
the influence of which is to be learnt by experience only.
The same may be said with respect to the application of manures.
The watering of pot-plants requires especial care. Water should as
a rule be used at a temperature not lower than that of the surrounding
atmosphere, and preferably after exposure for some time
to the air.

Bottom-Heat.&mdash;The &ldquo;optimum&rdquo; temperature, or that best suited
to promote the general activity of roots, and indeed of all vegetable
organs, necessarily varies very much with the nature of the plant,
and the circumstances in which it is placed, and is ascertained by
practical experience. Artificial heat applied to the roots, called by
gardeners &ldquo;bottom-heat,&rdquo; is supplied by fermenting materials
such as stable manure, leaves, &amp;c., or by hot-water pipes. In winter
the temperature of the soil, out of doors, beyond a certain depth is
usually higher than that of the atmosphere, so that the roots are
in a warmer and more uniform medium than are the upper parts
of the plant. Often the escape of heat from the soil is prevented by
&ldquo;mulching,&rdquo; i.e. by depositing on it a layer of litter, straw, dead
leaves and the like.

The Stem and its subdivisions or branches raise to the light and
air the leaves and flowers, serve as channels for the passage to them
of fluids from the roots, and act as reservoirs for nutritive substances.
Their functions in annual, biennial and herbaceous perennial plants
cease after the ripening of the seed, whilst in plants of longer duration
layer after layer of strong woody tissue is formed, which enables
them to bear the strains which the weight of foliage and the exposure
to wind entail. The gardener aims usually at producing stout,
robust, short-jointed stems, instead of long lanky growths defective
in woody tissue. To secure these conditions free exposure to light
and air is requisite; but in the case of coppices and woods, or
where long straight spars are needed by the forester, plants are
allowed to grow thickly so as to ensure development in an upward
rather than in a lateral direction. This and like matters will, however,
be more fitly considered in dealing hereafter with the buds
and their treatment.

Leaves.&mdash;The work of the leaves may briefly be stated to consist
of the processes of nutrition, respiration and transpiration. Nutri tion
(assimilation) by the leaves includes the inhalation of air, and
the interaction under the influence of light and in the presence of
chlorophyll of the carbon dioxide of the air with the water received
from the root, to form carbonaceous food. Respiration in plants,
as in other organisms, is a process that goes on by night as well as
by day and consists in plants in the breaking up of the complex
carbonaceous substances formed by assimilation into less complex
and more transportable substances. This process, which is as
yet imperfectly understood, is attended by the consumption of
oxygen, the liberation of energy in the form of heat, and the exhalation
of carbon dioxide and water vapour. Transpiration is
loss of water by the plant by evaporation, chiefly from the minute
pores or stomata on the leaves. In xerophytic plants (e.g. cacti,
euphorbias, &amp;c.) from hot, dry and almost waterless regions where
evaporation would be excessive, the leaf surface, and consequently
the number of stomata, are reduced to a minimum, as it would be
fatal to such plants to exhale vapour as freely in those regions as the
broad-leaved plants that grow in places where there is abundance of
moisture. Although transpiration is a necessary accompaniment of
nutrition, it may easily become excessive, especially where the plant
cannot readily recoup itself. In these circumstances &ldquo;syringing&rdquo;
and &ldquo;damping down&rdquo; are of value in cooling the temperature of
the air in hothouses and greenhouses and increasing its humidity,
thereby checking excessive transpiration. Shading the glass with
canvas or washes during the summer months has the same object
in view. Syringing is also beneficial in washing away dirt and
insects.

Buds.&mdash;The recognition of the various forms of buds and their
modes of disposition in different plants is a matter of the first
consequence in the operations of pruning and training. Flower-buds
are produced either on the old wood, i.e. the shoots of the
past year&rsquo;s growth, or on a shoot of the present year. The peach,
horse-chestnut, lilac, morello cherry, black currant, rhododendron
and many other trees and shrubs develop flower-buds for the next
season speedily after blossoming, and these may be stimulated into
premature growth. The peculiar short, stunted branches or &ldquo;spurs&rdquo;
which bear the flower-buds of the pear, apple, plum, sweet cherry,
red currant, laburnum, &amp;c., deserve special attention. In the rose,
passion-flower, clematis, honeysuckle, &amp;c., in which the flower-buds
are developed at the ends of the young shoot of the year,
we have examples of plants destitute of flower-buds during the
winter.

Propagation by Buds.&mdash;The detached leaf-buds (gemmae or bulbils),
of some plants are capable under favourable conditions of forming
new plants. The edges of the leaves of Bryophyllum calycinum
and of Cardamine pratensis, and the growths in the axils of the
leaves of Lilium bulbiferum, as well as the fronds of certain ferns
(e.g. Asplenium bulbiferum), produce buds of this character. It is
a matter of familiar observation that the ends of the shoots of
brambles take root when bent down to the ground. In some instances
buds form on the roots, and may be used for purposes of
propagation, as in the Japan quince, the globe thistle, the sea holly,
some sea lavenders, Bocconia, Acanthus, &amp;c. Of the tendency in buds
to assume an independent existence gardeners avail themselves in
the operations of striking &ldquo;cuttings,&rdquo; and making &ldquo;layers&rdquo; and
&ldquo;pipings,&rdquo; as also in budding and grafting. In taking a slip or
cutting the gardener removes from the parent plant a shoot having
one or more buds or &ldquo;eyes,&rdquo; in the case of the vine one only, and
places it in a moist and sufficiently warm situation, where, as
previously mentioned, undue evaporation from the surface is prevented.
For some cuttings, pots filled with light soil, with the
protection of the propagating-house and of bell-glasses, are requisite;
but for many of our hardy deciduous trees and shrubs no such
precautions are necessary, and the insertion of a short shoot about
half its length into moist and gritty ground at the proper season
suffices to ensure its growth. In the case of the more delicate plants,
the formation of roots is preceded by the production from the
cambium of the cuttings of a succulent mass of tissue, the callus.
It is important in some cases, e.g. zonal pelargoniums, fuchsias,
shrubby calceolarias, dahlias, carnations, &amp;c., to retain on the
cutting some of its leaves, so as to supply the requisite food for
storage in the callus. In other cases, where the buds themselves
contain a sufficiency of nutritive matter for the young growths, the
retention of leaves is not necessary. The most successful mode of
forming roots is to place the cuttings in a mild bottom-heat, which
expedites their growth, even in the case of many hardy plants whose
cuttings strike roots in the open soil. With some hard-wooded
trees, as the common white-thorn, roots cannot be obtained without
bottom-heat. It is a general rule throughout plant culture that
the activity of the roots shall be in advance of that of the leaves.
Cuttings of deciduous trees and shrubs succeed best if planted
early in autumn while the soil still retains the solar heat absorbed
during summer. For evergreens August or September, and for
greenhouse and stove-plants the spring and summer months, are
the times most suitable for propagation by cuttings.

Layering consists simply in bending down a branch and keeping
it in contact with or buried to a small depth in the soil until roots
are formed; the connexion with the parent plant may then be
743
severed. Many plants can be far more easily propagated thus than
by cuttings.

Grafting or &ldquo;working&rdquo; consists in the transfer of a branch, the
&ldquo;graft&rdquo; or &ldquo;scion,&rdquo; from one plant to another, which latter is
termed the &ldquo;stock.&rdquo; The operation must be so performed that the
growing tissues, or cambium-layer of the scion, may fit accurately
to the corresponding layer of the stock. In budding, as with roses
and peaches, a single bud only is implanted. Inarching is essentially
the promotion of the union of a shoot of one plant to that of another
of the same or allied species or variety. The outer bark of each
being removed, the two shoots are kept in contact by ligature until
union is established, when the scion is completely severed from its
original attachments. This operation is varied in detail according
to the kind of plant to be propagated, but it is essential in all cases
that the affinity between the two plants be near, that the union be
neatly effected, and that the ratio as well as the season of growth
of stock and scion be similar.

The selection of suitable stocks is a matter still requiring much
scientific experiment. The object of grafting is to expedite and
increase the formation of flowers and fruit. Strong-growing pears,
for instance, are grafted on the quince stock in order to restrict
their tendency to form &ldquo;gross&rdquo; shoots and a superabundance of
wood in place of flowers and fruit. Apples, for the same reason, are
&ldquo;worked&rdquo; on the &ldquo;paradise&rdquo; or &ldquo;doucin&rdquo; stocks, which from
their influence on the scion are known as dwarfing stocks. Scions
from a tree which is weakly, or liable to injury by frosts, are
strengthened by engrafting on robust stocks. Lindley has pointed
out that, while in Persia, its native country, the peach is probably
best grafted on the peach, or on its wild type the almond, in England,
where the summer temperature of the soil is much lower than that
of Persia, it might be expected, as experience has proved, to be
most successful on stocks of the native plum.

The soil in which the stock grows is a point demanding attention.
From a careful series of experiments made in the Horticultural
Society&rsquo;s Garden at Chiswick, it was found that where the soil is
loamy, or light and slightly enriched with decayed vegetable matter,
the apple succeeds best on the doucin stock, and the pear on the
quince; and where it is chalky it is preferable to graft the apple
on the crab, and the pear on the wild pear. For the plum on loamy
soils the plum, and on chalky and light soils the almond, are the
most desirable stocks, and for the cherry on loamy or light rich
soils the wild cherry, and on chalk the &ldquo;mahaleb&rdquo; stock.

The form and especially the quality of fruit is more or less affected
by the stock upon which it is grown. The Stanwick nectarine, so
apt to crack and not to ripen when worked in the ordinary way, is
said to be cured of these propensities by being first budded close
to the ground, on a very strong-growing Magnum Bonum plum,
worked on a Brussels stock, and by then budding the nectarine on
the Magnum Bonum about a foot from the ground. The fruit of
the pear is of a higher colour and smaller on the quince stock than
on the wild pear; still more so on the medlar. On the mountain ash
the pear becomes earlier.

The effects produced by stock on scion, and more particularly
by scion on stock, are as a rule with difficulty appreciable. Nevertheless,
in exceptional cases modified growths, termed &ldquo;graft-hybrids,&rdquo;
have been obtained which have been attributed to the
commingling of the characteristics of stock and scion (see Hybridism).
Of these the most remarkable example is Cytisus Adami, a tree
which year after year produces some shoots, foliage and flowers
like those of the common laburnum, others like those of the very
different looking dwarf shrub C. purpureus, and others again intermediate
between these. We may hence infer that C. purpureus
was grafted or budded on the common laburnum, and that the
intermediate forms are the result of graft-hybridization. Numerous
similar facts have been recorded. Among gardeners the general
opinion is against the possibility of graft-hybridization. The
wonder, however, seems to be that it does not occur more frequently,
seeing that fluids must pass from stock to scion, and matter elaborated
in the leaves of the scion must certainly to some extent enter the
stock. It is clear, nevertheless, from examination that as a rule
the wood of the stock and the wood of the scion retain their external
characters year by year without change. Still, as in the laburnum
just mentioned, in the variegated jasmine and in Abutilon Darwinii,
in the copper beech and in the horse-chestnut, the influence of a
variegated scion has occasionally shown itself in the production
from the stock of variegated shoots. At a meeting of the Scottish
Horticultural Association (see Gard. Chron., Jan. 10, 1880, figs. 12-14)
specimens of a small roundish pear, the &ldquo;Aston Town,&rdquo; and of the
elongated kind known as &ldquo;Beurré Clairgeau,&rdquo; were exhibited.
Two more dissimilar pears hardly exist. The result of working the
Beurré Clairgeau upon the Aston Town was the production of fruits
precisely intermediate in size, form, colour, speckling of rind and
other characteristics. Similar, though less marked, intermediate
characters were obvious in the foliage and flowers.

Double grafting (French, greffe sur greffe) is sufficiently explained
by its name. By means of it a variety may often be propagated,
or its fruit improved in a way not found practicable under ordinary
circumstances. For its successful prosecution prolonged experiments
in different localities and in gardens devoted to the purpose are
requisite.

Planting.&mdash;By removal from one place to another the growth of
every plant receives a check. How this check can be obviated or
reduced, with regard to the season, the state of atmosphere, and the
condition and circumstances of the plant generally, is a matter to
be considered by the practical gardener.

As to season, it is now admitted with respect to deciduous trees
and shrubs that the earlier in autumn planting is performed the
better; although some extend it from the period when the leaves
fall to the first part of spring, before the sap begins to move. If
feasible, the operation should be completed by the end of November,
whilst the soil is still warm with the heat absorbed during summer.
Attention to this rule is specially important in the case of rare
and delicate plants. Early autumn planting enables wounded
parts of roots to be healed over, and to form fibrils, which will be
ready in spring, when it is most required, to collect food for the
plant. Planting late in spring should, as far as possible, be avoided,
for the buds then begin to awaken into active life, and the draught
upon the roots becomes great. It has been supposed that because
the surface of the young leaves is small transpiration is correspondingly
feeble; but it must be remembered, not only that their newly-formed
tissue is unable without an abundant supply of sap from the
roots to resist the excessive drying action of the atmosphere, but
that, in spring, the lowness of the temperature at that season in
Great Britain prevents the free circulation of the sap. The comparative
dryness of the atmosphere in spring also causes a greater
amount of transpiration then than in autumn and winter. Another
fact in favour of autumnal planting is the production of roots in
winter.

The best way of performing transplantation depends greatly on
the size of the trees, the soil in which they grow, and the mechanical
appliances made use of in lifting and transporting them. The
smaller the tree the more successfully can it be removed. The more
argillaceous and the less siliceous the soil the more readily can balls
of earth be retained about the roots. All planters lay great stress
on the preservation of the fibrils; the point principally disputed is
to what extent they can with safety be allowed to be cut off in
transplantation. Trees and shrubs in thick plantations, or in
sheltered warm places, are ill fitted for planting in bleak and cold
situations. During their removal it is important that the roots
be covered, if only to prevent desiccation by the air. Damp days
are therefore the best for the operation; the dryest months are the
most unfavourable. Though success in transplanting depends much
on the humidity of the atmosphere, the most important requisite
is warmth in the soil; humidity can be supplied artificially, but
heat cannot.

Pruning, or the removal of superfluous growths, is practised in
order to equalize the development of the different parts of trees,
or to promote it in particular directions so as to secure a certain
form, and, by checking undue luxuriance, to promote enhanced
fertility. In the rose-bush, for instance, in which, as we have seen,
the flower-buds are formed on the new wood of the year, pruning
causes the old wood to &ldquo;break,&rdquo; i.e. to put forth a number of new
buds, some of which will produce flowers at their extremities. The
manner and the time in which pruning should be accomplished, and
its extent, vary with the plant, the objects of the operation, i.e.
whether for the production of timber or fruit, the season and
various other circumstances. So much judgment and experience
does the operation call for that it is a truism to say that bad pruning
is worse than none. The removal of weakly, sickly, overcrowded
and gross infertile shoots is usually, however, a matter about which
there can be few mistakes when once the habit of growth and the
form and arrangement of the buds are known. Winter pruning
is effected when the tree is comparatively at rest, and is therefore
less liable to &ldquo;bleeding&rdquo; or outpouring of sap. Summer pruning or
pinching off the tips of such of the younger shoots as are not required
for the extension of the tree, when not carried to too great an extent,
is preferable to the coarser more reckless style of pruning. The
injury inflicted is less and not so concentrated; the wounds are
smaller, and have time to heal before winter sets in. The effects
of badly-executed pruning, or rather hacking, are most noticeable
in the case of forest trees, the mutilation of which often results in
rotting, canker and other diseases. Judicious and timely thinning
so as to allow the trees room to grow, and to give them sufficiency
of light and air, will generally obviate the need of the pruning-saw,
except to a relatively small extent.

Training is a procedure adopted when it is required to grow plants
in a limited area, or in a particular shape, as in the case of many
plants of trailing habit. Judicious training also may be of importance
as encouraging the formation of flowers and fruit. Growth
in length is mainly in a vertical direction, or at least at the ends of
the shoots; and this should be encouraged, in the case of a timber
tree, or of a climbing plant which it is desired should cover a wall
quickly; but where flowers or fruit are specially desired, then,
when the wood required is formed, the lateral shoots may often be
trained more or less downward to induce fertility. The refinements
of training, as of pruning, may, however, be carried too far; and not
unfrequently the symmetrically trained trees of the French excite
admiration in every respect save fertility.

Sports or Bud Variations.&mdash;Here we may conveniently mention
certain variations from the normal condition in the size, form or
744
disposition of buds or shoots on a given plant. An inferior variety
of pear, for instance, may suddenly produce a shoot bearing fruit of
superior quality; a beech tree, without obvious cause, a shoot
with finely divided foliage; or a camellia an unwontedly fine flower.
When removed from the plant and treated as cuttings or grafts,
such sports may be perpetuated. Many garden varieties of flowers
and fruits have thus originated. The cause of their production is
very obscure.

Formation of Flowers.&mdash;Flowers, whether for their own sake or
as the necessary precursors of the fruit and seed, are objects of the
greatest concern to the gardener. As a rule they are not formed
until the plant has arrived at a certain degree of vigour, or until a
sufficient supply of nourishment has been stored in the tissues of
the plant. The reproductive process of which the formation of the
flower is the first stage being an exhaustive one, it is necessary that
the plant, as gardeners say, should get &ldquo;established&rdquo; before it
flowers. Moreover, although the green portions of the flower do
indeed perform the same office as the leaves, the more highly coloured
and more specialized portions, which are further removed from the
typical leaf-form, do not carry on those processes for which the
presence of chlorophyll is essential; and the floral organs may,
therefore, in a rough sense, be said to be parasitic upon the green
parts. A check or arrest of growth in the vegetative organs seems
to be a necessary preliminary to the development of the flower.

A diminished supply of water at the root is requisite, so as to check
energy of growth, or rather to divert it from leaf-making. Partial
starvation will sometimes effect this; hence the grafting of free-growing
fruit trees upon dwarfing stocks, as before alluded to,
and also the &ldquo;ringing&rdquo; or girdling of fruit trees, i.e. the removal
from the branch of a ring of bark, or the application of a tight
cincture, in consequence of which the growth of the fruits above
the wound or the obstruction is enhanced. On the same principle
the use of small pots to confine the roots, root-pruning and lifting
the roots, and exposing them to the sun, as is done in the case
of the vine in some countries, are resorted to. A higher temperature,
especially with deficiency of moisture, will tend to throw a plant
into a flowering condition. This is exemplified by the fact that
the temperature of the climate of Great Britain is too low for the
flowering, though sufficiently high for the growth of many plants.
Thus the Jerusalem artichoke, though able to produce stems and
tubers abundantly, only flowers in exceptionally hot seasons.

Forcing.&mdash;The operation of forcing is based upon the facts just
mentioned. By subjecting a plant to a gradually increasing temperature,
and supplying water in proportion, its growth may be accelerated;
its season of development may be, as it were, anticipated;
it is roused from a dormant to an active state. Forcing therefore
demands the most careful adjustment of temperature and supplies
of moisture and light.

Deficiency of light is less injurious than might at first be expected,
because the plant to be forced has stored up in its tissues, and
available for use, a reserve stock of material formed through the
agency of light in former seasons. The intensity of the colour of
flowers and the richness of flavour of fruit are, however, deficient
where there is feebleness of light. Recent experiments show that
the influence of electric light on chlorophyll is similar to that of
sunlight, and that deficiencies of natural light may to some extent
be made good by its use. The employment of that light for forcing
purposes would seem to be in part a question of expense. The
advantage hitherto obtained from its use has consisted in the
rapidity with which flowers have been formed and fruits ripened
under its influence, circumstances which go towards compensating
for the extra cost of production.

Retardation.&mdash;The art of retarding the period of flowering in certain
plants consists, in principle, in the artificial application of cold
temperatures whereby the resting condition induced by low winter
temperature is prolonged. For commercial purposes, crowns of lily
of the valley, tulip and other bulbs, and such deciduous woody
plants as lilac and deciduous species of rhododendron, while in a
state of rest, are packed in wet moss and introduced into cold-storage
chambers, where they may be kept in a state of quiescence,
it desired, throughout the following summer. The temperature of
the cold chamber is varied from the freezing-point of water, to a
few degrees lower, according to the needs of the plants under treatment.
When required for use they are removed to cool sheds to
thaw, and are then gradually inured to higher temperatures. The
chief advantages of retarded plants are:&mdash;(a) they may be flowered
almost at will; (b) they are readily induced to flower at those
times when unretarded plants refuse to respond to forcing. Cold-storage
chambers form a part of the equipment of most of the
leading establishments where flowers are grown for market.

Double Flowers.&mdash;The taste of the day demands that &ldquo;double
flowers&rdquo; should be largely grown. Though in many instances, as
in hyacinths, they are less beautiful than single ones, they always
present the advantage of being less evanescent. Under the vague
term &ldquo;double&rdquo; many very different morphological changes are
included. The flower of a double dahlia, e.g. offers a totally different
condition of structure from that of a rose or a hyacinth. The double
poinsettia, again, owes its so-called double condition merely to the
increased number of its scarlet involucral leaves, which are not
parts of the flower at all. It is reasonable, therefore, to infer that
the causes leading to the production of double flowers are varied.
A good deal of difference of opinion exists as to whether they are
the result of arrested growth or of exuberant development, and
accordingly whether restricted food or abundant supplies of nourishment
are the more necessary for their production. It must suffice
here to say that double flowers are most commonly the result of the
substitution of brightly-coloured petals for stamens or pistils or
both, and that a perfectly double flower where all the stamens
and pistils are thus metamorphosed is necessarily barren. Such a
plant must needs be propagated by cuttings. It rarely happens,
however, that the change is quite complete throughout the flower,
and so a few seeds may be formed, some of which may be expected
to reproduce the double-blossomed plants. By continuous selection
of seed from the best varieties, and &ldquo;roguing&rdquo; or eliminating plants
of the ordinary type, a &ldquo;strain&rdquo; or race of double flowers is gradually
produced.

Formation of Seed&mdash;Fertilization.&mdash;In fertilization&mdash;the influence
in flowering plants of the male-cell in the pollen tube upon the egg-cell
in the ovule (see Botany)&mdash;there are many circumstances of
importance horticulturally, to which, therefore, brief reference must
be made. Flowers, generally speaking, are either self-fertilized,
cross-fertilized or hybridized. Self-fertilization occurs when the
pollen of a given flower affects the egg-cell of the same individual
flower. Cross-fertilization varies both in manner and degree. In
the simplest instances the pollen of one flower fertilizes the ovules
of another on the same plant, owing to the stamens arriving at
maturity in any one flower earlier or later than the pistils.

Cross-fertilization must of necessity occur when the flowers are
structurally unisexual, as in the hazel, in which the male and female
flowers are monoecious, or separate on the same plant, and in the
willow, in which they are dioecious, or on different plants. A
conspicuous example of a dioecious plant is the common aucuba, of
which for years only the female plant was known in Britain. When,
through the introduction of the male plant from Japan, its fertilization
was rendered possible, ripe berries, before unknown, became
common ornaments of the shrub.

The conveyance of pollen from one flower to another in cross-fertilization
is effected naturally by the wind, or by the agency of
insects and other creatures. Flowers that require the aid of insects
usually offer some attraction to their visitors in the shape of bright
colour, fragrance or sweet juices. The colour and markings of a
flower often serve to guide the insects to the honey, in the obtaining
of which they are compelled either to remove or to deposit pollen.
The reciprocal adaptations of insects and flowers demand attentive
observation on the part of the gardener concerned with the growing
of grapes, cucumbers, melons and strawberries, or with the raising
of new and improved varieties of plants. In wind-fertilized plants
the flowers are comparatively inconspicuous and devoid of much
attraction for insects; and their pollen is smoother and smaller,
and better adapted for transport by the wind, than that of insect-fertilized
plants, the roughness of which adapts it for attachment
to the bodies of insects.

It is very probable that the same flower at certain times and
seasons is self-fertilizing, and at others not so. The defects which
cause gardeners to speak of certain vines as &ldquo;shy setters,&rdquo; and of
certain strawberries as &ldquo;blind,&rdquo; may be due either to unsuitable
conditions of external temperature, or to the non-accomplishment,
from some cause or other, of cross-fertilization. In a vinery, tomato-house
or a peach-house it is often good practice at the time of
flowering to tap the branches smartly with a stick so as to ensure
the dispersal of the pollen. Sometimes more delicate and direct
manipulation is required, and the gardener has himself to convey
the pollen from one flower to another, for which purpose a small
camel&rsquo;s-hair pencil is generally suitable. The degree of fertility
varies greatly according to external conditions, the structural and
functional arrangements just alluded to, and other causes which
may roughly be called constitutional. Thus, it often happens that
an apparently very slight change in climate alters the degree of
fertility. In a particular country or at certain seasons one flower
will be self-sterile or nearly so, and another just the opposite.

Hybridization.&mdash;Some of the most interesting results and many of
the gardener&rsquo;s greatest triumphs have been obtained by hybridization,
i.e. the crossing of two individuals not of the same but of
two distinct species of plants, as, for instance, two species of
rhododendron or two species of orchid (see Hybridism). It is
obvious that hybridization differs more in degree than in kind from
cross-fertilization. The occurrence of hybrids in nature explains the
difficulty experienced by botanists in deciding on what is a species,
and the widely different limitations of the term adopted by different
observers in the case of willows, roses, brambles, &amp;c. The artificial
process is practically the same in hybridization as in cross-fertilization,
but usually requires more care. To prevent self-fertilization,
or the access of insects, it is advisable to remove the stamens and
even the corolla from the flower to be impregnated, as its own pollen
or that of a flower of the same species is often found to be &ldquo;prepotent.&rdquo;
There are, however, cases, e.g. some passion-flowers and
rhododendrons, in which a flower is more or less sterile with its
own, but fertile with foreign pollen, even when this is from a distinct
species. It is a singular circumstance that reciprocal crosses are
not always or even often possible; thus, one rhododendron may
745
afford pollen perfectly potent on the stigma of another kind, by the
pollen of which latter its own stigma is unaffected.

The object of the hybridizer is to obtain varieties exhibiting
improvements in hardihood, vigour, size, shape, colour, fruitfulness,
resistance to disease or other attributes. His success depends not
alone on skill and judgment, for some seasons, or days even, are
found more propitious than others. Although promiscuous and
hap-hazard procedures no doubt meet with a measure of success,
the best results are those which are attained by systematic work with
a definite aim.

Hybrids are sometimes less fertile than pure-bred species, and
are occasionally quite sterile. Some hybrids, however, are as
fertile as pure-bred plants. Hybrid plants may be again crossed,
or even re-hybridized, so as to produce a progeny of very mixed
parentage. This is the case with many of our roses, dahlias, begonias,
pelargoniums, orchids and other long or widely cultivated garden
plants.

Reversion.&mdash;In modified forms of plants there is frequently a
tendency to &ldquo;sport&rdquo; or revert to parental or ancestral characteristics.
So markedly is this the case with hybrids that in a
few generations all traces of a hybrid origin may disappear. The
dissociation of the hybrid element in a plant must be obviated by
careful selection. The researches of Gregor Johann Mendel (1822-1884),
abbot of the Augustinian monastery at Brünn, in connexion
with peas and other plants, apparently indicate that there is a
definite natural law at work in the production of hybrids. Having
crossed yellow and green seeded peas both ways, he found that the
progeny resulted in all yellow coloured seeds. These gave rise in due
course to a second generation in which there were three yellows to
one green. In the third generation the yellows from the second
generation gave the proportion of one pure yellow, two impure
yellows, and one green; while the green seed of the second generation
threw only green seeds in the third, fourth and fifth generations.
The pure yellow in the third generation also threw pure yellows in the
fourth and fifth and succeeding generations. The impure yellows,
however, in the next generation gave rise to one pure yellow, one pure
green, to two impure yellows, and so on from generation to generation.
Accordingly as the green or the yellow predominated in the
progeny it was termed &ldquo;dominant,&rdquo; while the colour that disappeared
was called &ldquo;recessive.&rdquo; It happened, however, that a
recessive colour in one generation becomes the dominant in a succeeding
one.

Germination.&mdash;The length of the period during which seeds
remain dormant after their formation is very variable. The conditions
for germination are much the same as for growth in general.
Access to light is not required, because the seed contains a sufficiency
of stored-up food. The temperature necessary varies according to
the nature and source of the seed. Some seeds require prolonged
immersion in water to soften their shells; others are of so delicate a
texture that they would dry up and perish if not kept constantly
in a moist atmosphere. Seeds buried too deeply receive a deficient
supply of air. As a rule, seeds require to be sown more deeply in
proportion to their size and the lightness of the soil.

The time required for germination in the most favourable circumstances
varies very greatly, even in the same species, and in
seeds taken from one pod. Thus the seeds of Primula japonica,
though sown under precisely similar conditions, yet come up at
very irregular intervals of time. Germination is often slower where
there is a store of available food in the perisperm, or in the endosperm,
or in the embryo itself, than where this is scanty or wanting.
In the latter case the seedling has early to shift for itself, and to
form roots and leaves for the supply of its needs.

Selection.&mdash;Supposing seedlings to have been developed, it is
found that a large number of them present considerable variations,
some being especially robust, others peculiar in size or form. Those
most suitable for the purpose of the gardener are carefully selected
for propagation, while others not so desirable are destroyed; and
thus after a few generations a fixed variety, race or strain superior
to the original form is obtained. Many garden plants have originated
solely by selection; and much has been done to improve our breeds
of vegetables, flowers and fruit by systematic selection.

Large and well-formed seeds are to be preferred for harvesting.
The seeds should be kept in sacks or bags in a dry place, and if from
plants which are rare, or liable to lose their vitality, they are advantageously
packed for transmission to a distance in hermetically
sealed bottles or jars filled with earth or moss, without the addition
of moisture.

It will have been gathered from what has been said that seeds
cannot always be depended on to reproduce exactly the characteristics
of the plant which yielded them; for instance, seeds of the
greengage plum or of the Ribston pippin will produce a plum or
an apple, but not these particular varieties, to perpetuate which
grafts or buds must be employed.

Part II.&mdash;The Practice of Horticulture

The details of horticultural practice naturally range under
the three heads of flowers, fruits and vegetables (see also Fruit
and Flower Farming). There are, however, certain general
aspects of the subject which will be more conveniently noticed
apart, since they apply alike to each department. We shall
therefore first treat of these under four headings: formation
and preparation of the garden, garden structures and edifices,
garden materials and appliances, and garden operations.

I. Formation and Preparation of the Garden.

Site.&mdash;The site chosen for the mansion will more or less
determine that of the garden, the pleasure grounds and flower
garden being placed so as to surround or lie contiguous to it,
while the fruit and vegetable gardens, either together or separate,
should be placed on one side or in the rear, according to fitness
as regards the nature of the soil and subsoil, the slope of the
surface or the general features of the park scenery. In the
case of villa gardens there is usually little choice: the land
to be occupied is cut up into plots, usually rectangular, and
of greater or less breadth, and in laying out these plots there
is generally a smaller space left in the front of the villa residence
and a larger one behind, the front plot being usually devoted
to approaches, shrubbery and plantations, flower beds being
added if space permits, while the back or more private plot
has a piece of lawn grass with flower beds next the house, and a
space for vegetables and fruit trees at the far end, this latter
being shut off from the lawn by an intervening screen of evergreens
or other plants. Between these two classes of gardens
there are many gradations, but our remarks will chiefly apply
to those of larger extent.

The almost universal practice is to have the fruit and vegetable
gardens combined; and the flower garden may sometimes
be conveniently placed in juxtaposition with them. When the
fruit and vegetable gardens are combined, the smaller and choicer
fruit trees only should be admitted, such larger-growing hardy
fruits as apples, pears, plums, cherries, &amp;c., being relegated to
the orchard.

Ground possessing a gentle inclination towards the south
is desirable for a garden. On such a slope effectual draining
is easily accomplished, and the greatest possible benefit is
derived from the sun&rsquo;s rays. It is well also to have an open
exposure towards the east and west, so that the garden may
enjoy the full benefit of the morning and evening sun, especially
the latter; but shelter is desirable on the north and north-east,
or in any direction in which the particular locality may happen
to be exposed. In some places the south-western gales are so
severe that a belt of trees is useful as a break wind and shelter.

Soil and Subsoil.&mdash;A hazel-coloured loam, moderately light
in texture, is well adapted for most garden crops, whether
of fruits or vegetables, especially a good warm deep loam resting
upon chalk; and if such a soil occurs naturally in the selected
site, but little will be required in the way of preparation. If
the soil is not moderately good and of fair depth, it is not so
favourable for gardening purposes. Wherever the soil is not
quite suitable, but is capable of being made so, it is best to remedy
the defect at the outset by trenching it all over to a depth
of 2 or 3 ft., incorporating plenty of manure with it. A heavy
soil, although at first requiring more labour, generally gives far
better results when worked than a light soil. The latter is
not sufficiently retentive of moisture and gets too hot in
summer and requires large quantities of organic manures
to keep it in good condition. It is advantageous to possess
a variety of soils; and if the garden be on a slope it will
often be practicable to render the upper part light and dry,
while the lower remains of a heavier and damper nature.

Natural soils consist of substances derived from the decomposition
of various kinds of rocks, the bulk consisting of
clay, silica and lime, in various proportions. As regards preparation,
draining is of course of the utmost importance.
The ground should also be trenched to the depth of 3 ft. at
least, and the deeper the better so as to bring up the subsoil&mdash;whether
it be clay, sand, gravel, marl, &amp;c.&mdash;for exposure to
the weather and thus convert it from a sterile mass into a living
soil teeming with bacteria. In this operation all stones larger
than a man&rsquo;s fist must be taken out, and all roots of trees and of
746
perennial weeds carefully cleared away. When the whole
ground has been thus treated, a moderate liming will, in general,
be useful, especially on heavy clay soils. After this, supposing
the work to have occupied most of the summer, the whole may
be laid up in ridges, to expose as great a surface as possible
to the action of the winter&rsquo;s frost.


Argillaceous or clay soils are those which contain a large percentage
(45-50) of clay, and a small percentage (5 or less) of lime.
These are unfitted for garden purposes until improved by draining,
liming, trenching and the addition of porous materials, such as
ashes, burnt ballast or sand, but when thoroughly improved they
are very fertile and less liable to become exhausted than most other
soils. Loamy soils contain a considerable quantity (30-45%)
of clay, and smaller quantities of lime, humus and sand. Such
soils properly drained and prepared are very suitable for orchards,
and when the proportion of clay is smaller (20-30%) they form
excellent garden soils, in which the better sort of fruit trees luxuriate.
Marly soils are those which contain a considerable percentage
(10-20) of lime, and are called clay marls, loamy marls and sandy
marls, according as these several ingredients preponderate. The
clay marls are, like clay soils, too stiff for garden purposes until
well worked and heavily manured; but loamy marls are fertile
and well suited to fruit trees, and sandy marls are adapted for
producing early crops. Calcareous soils, which may also be heavy,
intermediate or light, are those which contain more than 20% of
lime, their fertility depending on the proportions of clay and sand
which enter into their composition; they are generally cold and wet.
Vegetable soils or moulds, or humus soils, contain a considerable
percentage (more than 5) of humus, and embrace both the rich
productive garden moulds and those known as peaty soils.


The nature of the subsoil is of scarcely less importance than
that of the surface soil. Many gardeners are still afraid to disturb
an unsuitable subsoil, but experienced growers have proved
that by bringing it up to the surface and placing plenty of
manure in the bottoms of the various trenches, the very best
results are attained in the course of a season or so. An uneven
subsoil, especially if retentive, is most undesirable, as water
is apt to collect in the hollows, and thus affect the upper soil.
The remedy is to make the plane of its surface agree with that
of the ground. When there is a hard pan this should be broken
up with the spade or the fork, and have plenty of manure mixed
with it. When there is an injurious preponderance of metallic
oxides or other deleterious substances, the roots of trees would
be affected by them, and they must therefore be removed. When
the subsoil is too compact to be pervious to water, effectual
drainage must be resorted to; when it is very loose, so that it
drains away the fertile ingredients of the soil as well as those
which are artificially supplied, the compactness of the stratum
should be increased by the addition of clay, marl or loam. The
best of all subsoils is a dry bed of clay overlying sandstone.

Plan.&mdash;In laying out the garden, the plan should be prepared
in minute detail before commencing operations. The form
of the kitchen and fruit garden should be square or oblong,
rather than curvilinear, since the working and cropping of
the ground can thus be more easily carried out. The whole
should be compactly arranged, so as to facilitate working,
and to afford convenient access for the carting of the heavy
materials. This access is especially desirable as regards the
store-yards and framing ground, where fermenting manures
and tree leaves for making up hot beds, coals or wood for fuel
and ingredients for composts, together with flower-pots and
the many necessaries of garden culture, have to be accommodated.
In the case of villas or picturesque residences,
gardens of irregular form may be permitted; when adapted
to the conditions of the locality, they associate better with
surrounding objects, but in such gardens wall space is usually
limited.

The distribution of paths must be governed by circumstances.
Generally speaking, the main paths for cartage should be 8 ft.
wide, made up of 9 in. hard core covered by 4 in. of gravel
or ash, with a gentle rise to centre to throw off surface water.
The smaller paths, not intended for cartage, should be 4 ft.
to 6 ft. wide, according to circumstances, made up of 6 in.
hard core and 3 in. of gravel or ash, and should be slightly
raised at centre.

A considerable portion of the north wall is usually covered
in front with the glazed structures called forcing-houses, and to
these the houses for ornamental plants are sometimes attached;
but a more appropriate site for the latter is the flower garden,
when that forms a separate department. It is well, however,
that everything connected with the forcing of fruits or flowers
should be concentrated in one place. The frame ground, including
melon and pine pits, should occupy some well-sheltered
spot in the slips, or on one side of the garden, and adjoining to
this may be found a suitable site for the compost ground, in
which the various kinds of soils are kept in store, and in which
also composts may be prepared.

As walls afford valuable space for the growth of the choicer
kinds of hardy fruits, the direction in which they are built
is of considerable importance. In the warmer parts of the
country the wall on the north side of the garden should be so
placed as to face the sun at about an hour before noon, or a
little to the east of south; in less favoured localities it should
be made to face direct south, and in still more unfavourable
districts it should face the sun an hour after noon, or a little
west of south. The east and west walls should run parallel
to each other, and at right angles to that on the north side,
in all the most favoured localities; but in colder or later ones,
though parallel, they should be so far removed from a right angle
as to get the sun by eleven o&rsquo;clock. On the whole, the form of
a parallelogram with its longest sides in the proportion of about
five to three of the shorter, and running east and west, may be
considered the best form, since it affords a greater extent of
south wall than any other.



Fig. 1.&mdash;Plan of Garden an acre in area.


Fig. 1 represents a garden of one acre and admits of nearly double
the number of trees on the south aspect as compared with the east
and west; it allows a greater number of espalier or pyramid trees
to face the south; and it admits of being divided into equal principal
compartments, each of
which forms nearly a
square. The size of course
can be increased to any
requisite extent. That of
the royal gardens at Frogmore,
760 ft. from east to
west and 440 ft. from
north to south, is nearly
of the same proportions.


The spaces between
the walls and the outer
fence are called &ldquo;slips.&rdquo;
A considerable extent is
sometimes thus enclosed,
and utilized for the
growth of such vegetables as potatoes, winter greens and sea-kale,
for the small bush fruits, and for strawberries. The
slips are also convenient as affording a variety of aspects,
and thus helping to prolong the season of particular vegetable
crops.

Shelter.&mdash;A screen of some kind to temper the fury of the
blast is absolutely necessary. If the situation is not naturally
well sheltered, the defect may be remedied by masses of forest
trees disposed at a considerable distance so as not to shade the
walls or fruit trees. They should not be nearer than, say, 50 yds.,
and may vary from that to 100 or 150 yds. distance according
to circumstances, regard being had especially to peculiarities
occasioned by the configuration of the country, as for instance to
aerial currents from adjacent eminences. Care should be taken,
however, not to hem in the garden by crowded plantations, shelter
from the prevailing strong winds being all that is required, while
the more open it is in other directions the better. The trees
employed for screens should include both those of deciduous
and of evergreen habit, and should suit the peculiarities of local
soil and climate. Of deciduous trees the sycamore, wych-elm,
horse-chestnut, beech, lime, plane and poplar may be used,&mdash;the
abele or white poplar, Populus alba, being one of the most rapid-growing
of all trees, and, like other poplars, well suited for
nursing other choicer subjects; while of evergreens, the holm
oak, holly, laurel (both common and Portugal), and such conifers
as the Scotch, Weymouth and Austrian pines, with spruce and
747
silver firs and yews, are suitable. The conifers make the most
effective screens.

Extensive gardens in exposed situations are often divided
into compartments by hedges, so disposed as to break the force
of high winds. Where these are required to be narrow as well
as lofty, holly, yew or beech is to be preferred; but, if there
is sufficient space, the beautiful laurel and the bay may be
employed where they will thrive. Smaller hedges may be
formed of evergreen privet or of tree-box. These subordinate
divisions furnish, not only shelter but also shade, which, at
certain seasons, is peculiarly valuable.

Belts of shrubbery may be placed round the slips outside
the walls; and these may in many cases, or in certain parts,
be of sufficient breadth to furnish pleasant retired promenades,
at the same time that they serve to mask the formality of the
walled gardens, and are made to harmonize with the picturesque
scenery of the pleasure ground.

Water Supply.&mdash;Although water is one of the most important
elements in plant life, we do not find one garden in twenty where
even ordinary precautions have been taken to secure a competent
supply. Rain-water is the best, next to that river or pond
water, and last of all that from springs; but a chemical analysis
should be made of the last before introducing it, as some spring
waters contain mineral ingredients injurious to vegetation. Iron
pipes are the best conductors; they should lead to a capacious
open reservoir placed outside the garden, and at the highest
convenient level, in order to secure sufficient pressure for effective
distribution, and so that the wall trees also may be effectually
washed. Stand-pipes should be placed at intervals beside the
walks and in other convenient places, from which water may at
all times be drawn; and to which a garden hose can be attached,
so as to permit of the whole garden being readily watered.
The mains should be placed under the walks for safety, and also
that they may be easily reached when repairs are required.
Pipes should also be laid having a connexion with all the various
greenhouses and forcing-houses, each of which should be provided
with a cistern for aerating the daily supplies. In fact,
every part of the garden, including the working sheds and
offices, should have water supplied without stint.

Fence.&mdash;Gardens of large extent should be encircled by an
outer boundary, which is often formed by a sunk wall or ha-ha
surrounded by an invisible wire fence to exclude ground game,
or consists of a hedge with low wire fence on its inner side.
Occasionally this sunk wall is placed on the exterior of the
screen plantations, and walks lead through the trees, so that
views are obtained of the adjacent country. Although the
interior garden receives its form from the walls, the ring fence
and plantations may be adapted to the shape and surface of
the ground. In smaller country gardens the enclosure or outer
fence is often a hedge, and there is possibly no space enclosed
by walls, but some divisional wall having a suitable aspect is
utilized for the growth of peaches, apricots, &amp;c., and the hedge
merely separates the garden from a paddock used for grazing.
The still smaller gardens of villas are generally bounded by a wall
or wood fence, the inner side of which is appropriated to fruit
trees. For the latter walls are much more convenient and
suitable than a boarded fence, but in general these are too low to
be of much value as aids to cultivation, and they are best covered
with bush fruits or with ornamental plants of limited growth.

Walks.&mdash;The best material for the construction of garden
walks is good binding gravel. The ground should be excavated
to the depth of a foot or more&mdash;the bottom being made firm and
slightly concave, so that it may slope to the centre, where a drain
should be introduced; or the bottom may be made convex and
the water allowed to drain away at the sides. The bottom 9 in.
should be filled in compactly with hard, coarse materials, such
as stones, brickbats, clinkers, burned clay, &amp;c., on which should
be laid 2 or 3 in. of coarse gravel, and then 1 or 2 in. of firm
binding gravel on the surface. The surface of the walks should be
kept well rolled, for nothing contributes more to their elegance
and durability.

All the principal lines of walk should be broad enough to allow
at least three persons to walk abreast; the others may be
narrower, but a multitude of narrow walks has a puny effect.
Much of the neatness of walks depends upon the material of
which they are made. Gravel from an inland pit is to be preferred;
though occasionally very excellent varieties are found
upon the sea-coast. Gravel walks must be kept free from weeds,
either by hand weeding, or by the use of one of the many weed
killers now on the market. In some parts of the country the
available material does not bind to form a close, even surface,
and such walks are kept clean by hoeing.

Grass walks were common in English gardens during the prevalence
of the Dutch taste, but, owing to the frequent humidity
of the climate, they have in a great measure been discarded.
Grass walks are made in the same way as grass lawns. When the
space to be thus occupied is prepared, a thin layer of sand or poor
earth is laid upon the surface and over this a similar layer of
good soil. This arrangement is adopted in order to prevent
excessive luxuriance in the grass. In many modern gardens
pathways made of old paving stones lead from the house to
different parts. They give an old-fashioned and restful appearance
to a garden, and in the interstices charming little plants like
thyme, Ionopsidium acaule, &amp;c., are allowed to grow.

Edgings.&mdash;Walks are separated from the adjoining beds and
borders in a variety of ways. If a living edging is adopted,
by far the best is afforded by the dwarf box planted closely
in line. It is of extremely neat growth, and when annually
clipped will remain in good order for many years. Very good
edgings, but of a less durable character, are formed by thrift
(Armeria vulgaris), double daisy (Bellis perennis), gentianella
(Gentiana acaulis) and London pride (Saxifraga umbrosa),
Cerastium tomentosum, Stachys lavata and the beautiful evergreen
Veronica rupestris with sheets of bright blue flowers
close to the ground, or by some of the finer grasses very carefully
selected, such as the sheep&rsquo;s fescue (Festuca ovina) or its
glaucous-leaved variety. Indeed, any low-growing herbaceous
plant, susceptible of minute division, is suitable for an edging.
Amongst shrubby plants suitable for edgings are the evergreen
candytuft (Iberis sempervirens), Euonymus radicans variegata,
ivy, and Euonymus microphyllus&mdash;a charming little evergreen
with small serrated leaves. Edgings may also be formed of
narrow slips of sandstone flag, slate, tiles or bricks. One
advantage of using edgings of this kind, especially in kitchen
gardens, is that they do not harbour slugs and similar vermin,
which all live edgings do, and often to a serious extent, if they
are left to grow large. In shrubberies and large flower-plots,
verges of grass-turf, from 1 to 3 ft. in breadth, according to the
size of the border and width of the walk, make a very handsome
edging, but they should not be allowed to rise more than an
inch and a half above the gravel, the grass being kept short by
repeated mowings, and the edges kept trim and well-defined
by frequently clipping with shears and cutting once or twice a
year with an edging iron.

II. Garden Structures.

Walls.&mdash;The position to be given to the garden walls has
been already referred to. The shelter afforded by a wall, and the
increased temperature secured by its presence, are indispensable
in the climate of Great Britain, for the production of all the
finer kinds of outdoor fruits; and hence the inner side of a north
wall, having a southern aspect, is appropriated to the more
tender kinds. It is, indeed, estimated that such positions
enjoy an increased temperature equal to 7° of latitude&mdash;that
is to say, the mean temperature within a few inches of the wall
is equal to the mean temperature of the open plain 7° farther
south. The eastern and western aspects are set apart for fruits
of a somewhat hardier character.

Where the inclination of the ground is considerable, and the
presence of high walls would be objectionable, the latter may
be replaced by sunk walls. These should not rise more than
3 ft. above the level of the ground behind them. As dryness is
favourable to an increase of heat, such walls should be either
built hollow or packed behind to the thickness of 3 or 4 ft.
748
with rubble stones, flints, brickbats or similar material, thoroughly
drained at bottom. For mere purposes of shelter a height of
6 or 7 ft. will generally be sufficient for the walls of a garden,
but for the training of fruit trees it is found that an average
height of 12 ft. is more suitable. In gardens of large size the
northern or principal wall may be 14 ft., and the side walls 12 ft. in
height; while smaller areas of an acre or so should have the
principal walls 12 and the side walls 10 ft. in height. As brick
is more easily built hollow than stone, it is to be preferred for
garden walls. A 14-in. hollow wall will take in its construction
12,800 bricks, while a solid 9-in. one, with piers, will take 11,000;
but the hollow wall, while thus only a little more costly, will
be greatly superior, being drier and warmer, as well as more
substantial. Bricks cannot be too well burnt for garden walls;
the harder they are the less moisture will they absorb. Many
excellent walls are built of stone. The best is dark-coloured
whinstone, because it absorbs very little moisture, or in Scotland
Caithness pavement 4 in. thick. The stones can be cut (in the
quarries) to any required length, and built in regular courses.
Stone walls should always be built with thin courses for convenience
of training over their surface. Concrete walls, properly coped
and provided with a trellis, may in some places be cheapest, and
they are very durable. Common rubble walls are the worst of all.

The coping of garden walls is important, both for the preservation
of the walls and for throwing the rain-water off their surfaces.
It should not project less than from 2 to 2½ in., but in wet
districts may be extended to 6 in. Stone copings are best,
but they are costly, and Portland cement is sometimes substituted.
Temporary copings of wood, which may be fixed
by means of permanent iron brackets just below the stone coping,
are extremely useful in spring for the protection of the blossoms
of fruit trees. They should be 9 in. or 1 ft. wide, and should
be put on during spring before the blossom buds begin to expand;
they should have attached to them scrim cloth (a sort of thin
canvas), which admits light pretty freely, yet is sufficient to
ward off ordinary frosts; this canvas is to be let down towards
evening and drawn up again in the morning. These copings
should be removed when they are of no further utility as protectors,
so that the foliage may have the full benefit of rain
and dew. Any contrivance that serves to interrupt radiation,
though it may not keep the temperature much above freezing,
will be found sufficient. Standard fruit trees must be left to
take their chance; and, indeed from the lateness of their flowering,
they are generally more injured by blight, and by drenching
rains, which wash away the pollen of the flowers, than by the
direct effects of cold.

Espalier Rails.&mdash;Subsidiary to walls as a means of training
fruit trees, espalier rails were formerly much employed, and
are still used in many gardens. In their simplest form, they
are merely a row of slender stakes of larch or other wood driven
into the ground, and connected by a slight rod or fillet at top.
The use of iron rails has now been almost wholly discontinued
on account of metallic substances acting as powerful conductors
of both heat and cold in equal extremes. Standards from
which galvanized wire is tightly strained from one end to the
other are preferable and very convenient. Trees trained to
them are easily got at for all cultural operations, space is saved,
and the fruit, while freely exposed to sun and air, is tolerably
secure against wind. They form, moreover, neat enclosures
for the vegetable quarters, and, provided excess of growth
from the centre is successfully grappled with, they are productive
in soils and situations which are suitable.

Plant Houses.&mdash;These include all those structures which are
more intimately associated with the growth of ornamental
plants and flowers, and comprise conservatory, plant stove,
greenhouse and the subsidiary pits and frames. They should
be so erected as to present the smallest extent of opaque surface
consistent with stability. With this object in view, the early
improvers of hot-house architecture substituted metal for wood
in the construction of the roofs, and for the most part dispensed
with back walls; but the conducting power of the metal caused
a great irregularity of temperature, which it was found difficult
to control; and, notwithstanding the elegance of metallic
houses, this circumstance, together with their greater cost,
has induced most recent authorities to give the preference to
wood. The combination of the two, however, shows clearly
that, without much variation of heat or loss of light, any extent
of space may be covered, and houses of any altitude constructed.


The earliest notice we have of such structures is given in the Latin
writers of the 1st century (Mart. Epigr. viii. 14 and 68); the
&#7944;&#948;&#8032;&#957;&#953;&#948;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#8134;&#960;&#959;&#953;, to which allusion is made by various Greek authors,
have no claim to be mentioned in this connexion. Columella
(xi. 3, 51, 52) and Pliny (H.N. xix. 23) both refer to their use in
Italy for the cultivation of the rarer and more delicate sorts of plants
and trees. Seneca has given us a description of the application of
hot water for securing the necessary temperature. The botanist
Jungermann had plant houses at Altdorf in Switzerland; those of
Loader, a London merchant, and the conservatory in the Apothecaries&rsquo;
Botanic Garden at Chelsea, were among the first structures
of the kind erected in British gardens. These were, however, ill
adapted for the growth of plants, as they consisted of little else than
a huge chamber of masonry, having large windows in front, with
the roof invariably opaque. The next step was taken when it became
fashionable to have conservatories attached to mansions, instead of
having them in the pleasure grounds. This arrangement brought
them within the province of architects, and for nearly a century
utility and fitness for the cultivation of plants were sacrificed, as still
is often the case, to the unity of architectural expression between
the conservatory and the mansion.




Fig. 2.&mdash;Lean-to Plant House.

Plant houses must be as far as possible impervious to wet and
cold air from the exterior, provision at the same time being
made for ventilation, while the escape of warm air from the interior
must also be under control. The most important part of the
enclosing material is necessarily glass. But as the rays of light,
even in passing through transparent glass, lose much of their
energy, which is further weakened in proportion to the distance
it has to travel, the nearer the plant can be placed to the glass
the more perfectly will its functions be performed; hence the
importance of constructing the roofs at such an angle as will
admit the most light, especially sunlight, at the time it is most
required. Plants in glass houses require for their fullest development
more solar light probably than even our best hot-houses
transmit&mdash;certainly much more than is transmitted through
the roofs of houses as generally constructed.

Plant houses constructed of the best Baltic pine timber are
very durable, but the whole of the parts should be kept as light
as possible. In many houses, especially those where ornament
is of no consequence, the rafters are now omitted, or only used
at wide intervals, somewhat stouter sash-bars being adopted, and
stout panes of glass (usually called 21-oz.) 12 to 18 in. wide, made
use of. Such houses are very light; being also very close, they
require careful ventilation. The glass roof is commonly designed
so as to form a uniform plane or slope from back to front in lean-to
houses (fig. 2), and from centre to sides in span-roofed houses.
To secure the greatest possible influx of light, some horticulturists
recommend curvilinear roofs; but the superiority of these is
largely due to the absence of rafters, which may also be dispensed
with in plain roofs. They are very expensive to build
and maintain. Span and ridge-and-furrow roofs, the forms now
mostly preferred, are exceedingly well adapted for the admission
of light, especially when they are glazed to within a few inches
749
of the ground. They can be made, too, to cover in any extent
of area without sustaining walls. Indeed, it has been proposed
to support such roofs to a great extent upon suspension principles,
the internal columns of support being utilized for conducting
the rain-water off the roof to underground drains or reservoirs.
The lean-to is the least desirable form, since it scarcely admits of
elegance of design, but it is necessarily adopted in many cases.

In glazing, the greater the surface of glass, and the less space
occupied by rafters and astragals as well as overlaps, the greater
the admission of light. Some prefer that the sash-bars should
be grooved instead of rebated, and this plan exposes less putty
to the action of the weather. The simple bedding of the glass,
without the use of over putty, seems to be widely approved; but
the glass may be fixed in a variety of other ways, some of which
are patented.


The Conservatory is often built in connexion with the mansion,
so as to be entered from the drawing-room or boudoir. But when
so situated it is apt to suffer from the shade of the building, and
is objectionable on account of admitting damp to the drawing-room.
Where circumstances will admit, it is better to place it at some
distance from the house, and to form a connexion by means of a
glass corridor. In order that the conservatory may be kept gay with
flowers, there should be a subsidiary structure to receive the plants
as they go out of bloom. The conservatory may also with great
propriety be placed in the flower garden, where it may occupy an
elevated terrace, and form the termination of one of the more important
walks.

Great variety of design is admissible in the conservatory, but it
ought always to be adapted to the style of the mansion of which it
is a prominent appendage. Some very pleasing examples are to be
met with which have the form of a parallelogram with a lightly-rounded
roof; others of appropriate character are square or nearly
so, with a ridge-and-furrow roof. Whatever the form, there must be
light in abundance; and the shade both of buildings and of trees
must be avoided. A southern aspect, or one varying to south-east or
south-west, is preferable; if these aspects cannot be secured, the
plants selected must be adapted to the position. The central part of
the house may be devoted to permanent plants; the side stages and
open spaces in the permanent beds should be reserved for the
temporary plants.



Fig. 3.&mdash;Section of Greenhouse.

The Greenhouse is a structure designed for the growth of such
exotic plants as require to be kept during winter in a temperature
considerably above the freezing-point. The best form is the
span-roofed,
a single span being better even than a series of spans such
as form the ridge-and-furrow roof. For plant culture, houses at a
comparatively low pitch are better than higher ones where the plants
have to stand at a greater distance from the glass, and therefore in
greater gloom. Fig. 3 represents a convenient form of greenhouse.
It is 20 ft. wide and
12 ft. high, and may
be of any convenient
length. The side
walls are surmounted
by short upright
sashes which open
outwards by machinery
a, and the
roof is provided with
sliding upper sashes
for top ventilation.
The upper sashes
may also be made to
lift, and are in many
respects more convenient
to operate.
In the centre is a
two-tier stage 6 ft.
wide, for plants, with a pathway on each side 3 ft. wide, and a
side stage 4 ft. wide, the side stages being flat, and the centre stage
having the middle portion one-third of the width elevated 1 ft.
above the rest so as to lift up the middle row of plants nearer
the light. Span-roofed houses of this character should run north
and south so as to secure an equalization of light, and should
be warmed by two flow, and one or two return 4-in. hot-water pipes,
carried under the side stages along each side and across each end.
Where it is desired to cultivate a large number of plants, it is much
better to increase the number of such houses than to provide larger
structures. The smaller houses are far better for cultural purposes,
while the plants can be classified, and the little details of management
more conveniently attended to. Pelargoniums, cinerarias, calceolarias,
cyclamens, camellias, heaths, roses and other specialities might thus
have to themselves either a whole house or part of a house, the conditions
of which could then be more accurately fitted to the wants of
the inmates.

The lean-to house is in most respects inferior to the span-roofed;
one of the latter could be converted into two of the former of opposite
aspects by a divisional wall along the centre. Except where space
does not permit a span-roofed building to be introduced, a lean-to
is not to be recommended; but a house of this class may often be
greatly improved by adopting a half-span or hipped roof&mdash;that is,
one with a short slope behind and a longer in front.



Fig. 4.&mdash;Section of Plant Stove.

Where the cultivation of large specimens has to be carried on, a
span-roofed house of greater height and larger dimensions may
sometimes prove useful; but space for this class of plants may
generally be secured in a house of the smaller elevation, simply by
lowering or removing altogether the staging erected for smaller
plants, and allowing the larger ones to stand on or nearer the floor.
The Plant Stove differs in no respect from the greenhouse except
in having a greater extent of hot-water pipes for the purpose of
securing a greater degree of heat, although, as the plants in stove
houses often attain a
larger size, and many of
them require a bed of
coco-nut fibre, tan or
leaf mould to supply
them with bottom heat,
a  somewhat  greater
elevation may perhaps
be occasionally required
in some of the houses.
For the smaller plants,
and for all choicer subjects,
the smaller size
of house already recommended
for greenhouses,
namely 20 ft. wide and
12 ft. high, with a side
table of 4 ft. on each side,
a pathway of 3 ft. and a
central stage on two levels
of 6 ft. wide, will be preferable, because more easily managed as to the
supply of heat and moisture. It will be seen (fig. 4) that along the
ridge of the roof a raised portion or lantern light b, b is introduced,
which permits of the fixing of two continuous ventilators, one along
each side, for the egress of heated and foul air, openings a, a being
also provided in the side walls opposite the hot-water pipes for the
admission of pure cold air. This type of house is also very suitable
for greenhouse plants, but would not need so much heating apparatus.
Three or four rows of flow and return pipes respectively will be required
on each side, according to the heat proposed to be maintained.

In their interior fittings plant stoves require more care than greenhouses,
which are much drier, and in which consequently the staging
does not so soon decay. In stoves the stages should be of slate or
stone where practicable, and the supports of iron. These should be
covered with a layer of 2 or 3 in. of some coarse gritty material, such
as pounded spar, or the shell sand obtained on the sea-coast, on which
the pots are to stand; its use is to absorb moisture and gradually
give it out for the benefit of the plants. The pathways should be
paved with tiles, brick or stone, or made of concrete and cement, and
the surface should be gently rounded so that the water required for
evaporation may drain to the sides while the centre is sufficiently
dry to walk upon; they should also have brick or stone edgings to
prevent the water so applied soaking away at the sides and thus
being wasted.




Fig. 5.&mdash;Lean-to Vinery.

Fruit Houses.&mdash;The principal of these are the vinery, peach
house, cucumber and melon house and orchard house. These,
or a portion of them,
especially the vineries
and peacheries, are
frequently brought
together into a range
along the principal
interior or south wall
of the garden, where
they are well exposed
to sun and light, an
ornamental plant
house being sometimes
introduced into the centre of the range in order to give
effect to the outline of the buildings. When thus associated,
the houses are usually of the lean-to class, which have the
750
advantage of being more easily warmed and kept warm than
buildings having glass on both sides, a matter of great importance
for forcing purposes.



Fig. 6.&mdash;Hip-Roofed Vinery.


The Vinery is a house devoted to the culture of the grape-vine,
which is by far the most important exotic fruit cultivated in English
gardens. When forming part of a range a vinery would in most cases
be a lean-to structure, with a sharp pitch (45-50°) if intended for
early forcing, and a flatter roof (40°) with longer rafters if designed
for the main and late crops. (1) The lean-to (fig. 5) is the simplest
form, often erected against some existing wall, and the best for early
forcing, being warmer on account of the shelter afforded by the back
wall. In this house the principal part of the roof is a fixture, ventilation
being provided for by small lifting sashes against the back wall,
and by the upright front sashes being hung on a pivot so as to swing
outwards on the lower side.
The necessary heat is provided
by four 4-in. hot-water
pipes, which would perhaps
be best placed if all laid
side by side, while the vines
are planted in front and
trained upwards under the
roof. A second set of vines
may be planted against the
back wall, and will thrive
there until the shade of the
roof becomes too dense. (2)
The hip-roofed or three-quarter
span (fig. 6) is a
combination of the lean-to
and the span-roofed, uniting
to a great degree the advantages
of both, being
warmer than the span and
lighter than the lean-to. The heating and ventilating arrangements
are much the same as in the lean-to, only the top sashes which open
are on the back slope, and therefore do not interfere so much with
the vines on the front slope. In both this and the lean-to the aspect
should be as nearly due south as possible. Houses of this form are
excellent for general purposes, and they are well adapted both for
muscats, which require a high temperature, and for late-keeping
grapes. (3) The span-roofed (fig. 7), the most elegant and ornamental
form, is especially adapted for isolated positions; indeed, no other
form affords so much roof space for the development of the vines.
The amount of light admitted being very great, these houses answer
well for general purposes and for the main crop. The large amount of
glass or cooling surface, however, makes it more difficult to keep up
a high and regular temperature in them, and from this cause they
are not so well adapted for very early or very late crops. They are
best, nevertheless, when grapes and ornamental plants are grown in
the same house, except, indeed, in very wet and cold districts, where,
in consequence of its greater warmth, the lean-to is to be preferred.
This type of house, cheaply constructed, is in general use for raising
grapes for market.



Fig. 7.&mdash;Span-Roofed Vinery.

The Peach House is a structure in which the ripening of the fruit
is accelerated by the judicious employment of artificial heat. For
early forcing, as in vineries, the lean-to form is to be preferred, and
the house may have a tolerably sharp pitch. A width of 7 or 8 ft.,
with the glass slope continued down to within a foot or two of the
ground, and without any upright front sashes, will be suitable for
such a house, which may also be conveniently divided into compartments
of from 30 to 50 ft. in length according to the extent of
the building, small houses being preferable to larger ones. As a very
high temperature is not required, two or three pipes running the
whole length of the house will suffice. The front wall should be built
on piers and arches to allow the roots to pass outwards into a prepared
border, the trees being planted just within the house. Abundant
means of ventilation should be provided.



Fig. 8.&mdash;Peach House.

For more general purposes the house represented in fig. 8 will be
found more useful. One set of trees is planted near the front, and
trained to an arched trellis b.
Another set is planted at the
back, and trained on a trellis
c, which is nearly upright, and
leans against the back wall;
or the back wall itself may
be used for training. There
are no upright front sashes,
but to facilitate ventilation
there are ventilators d in the
front wall, and the upper roof
sashes are made to move up
and down for the same object. Two or three hot-water pipes
are placed near the front wall. The back wall is usually planted
with dwarf and standard trees alternately, the latter being temporary,
and intended to furnish the upper part of the trellis, while the permanent
dwarfs arc gradually filling up the trellis from below. In any
case the front trellis should stop conveniently short of the top of the
sashes if there are trees against the back wall, in order to admit light
to them. They would also be better carried up nearly parallel to
the roof, and at about 1 ft. distant from it, supposing there were no
trees at the back.



Fig. 9.&mdash;Forcing House.

A span-roofed house, being lighter than a lean-to, would be so
much the better for peach culture, especially for the crop grown just
in anticipation of those from the open walls since a high temperature
is not required. A low span, with dwarf side walls, and a lantern
ventilator along the ridge, the height in the centre being 9 ft., would
be very well adapted for the purpose. The trees should be planted
inside and trained up towards the ridge on a trellis about a foot from
the glass, the walls being arched to permit the egress of the roots.
A trellis path should run along the centre, and movable pieces of
trellis should be provided to prevent trampling on the soil while
dressing and tying in the young wood.

The Forcing House.&mdash;Whenever continuous supplies of cucumbers,
melons and tomatoes are required, it is most convenient to grow them
in properly constructed forcing houses. Span-roofed houses (fig. 9)
arc probably the most useful for the purpose. They are usually
751
12 to 14 ft. wide, by 10 to 12 ft. high, and of any convenient length.
Heating is effected by means of hot-water pipes below the beds, and
against the side ventilators. The walls bordering the central paths
are arched or clotted to admit heat from the chambers below the
beds. Side pipes are occasionally dispensed with, heat being obtained
by means of slots at the back of the beds, communicating with the
chambers. The beds are also of use for plunging pot plants. Ventilation
is provided at sides and top.

Pits and frames of various kinds are frequently used for the cultivation
of cucumbers and melons, as well as hot beds covered by
ordinary garden frames. In these cases the first supply of heat is
derived from the hot bed made up within the pit. When the heat
of the original bed subsides, linings of fermenting dung must be
added, and these must be kept active by occasional turnings and the
addition of fresh material as often as required. It is better, however,
to effect both top and bottom heating by hot-water pipes.

Orchard Houses are span-roofed or lean-to structures, in which
various fruits are cultivated without the aid of artificial heat.
Peaches, nectarines, apricots, cherries and the more tender varieties
of plums and pears succeed well in houses of this kind. The types of
houses in general use are substantially as shown in fig. 7, for span-roofed,
and as fig. 5, for lean-to; in each case without the heating
apparatus. The orchard house is among the most generally useful
of all garden structures. These houses require careful management
in early summer so as to induce the more delicate varieties of peaches
and nectarines to complete and ripen their growth before cold, sunless
weather sets in.

In commercial establishments where utility is of more importance
than ornament, the glass houses and hot water apparatus are not of
so elaborate a type as indicated in the foregoing remarks, and in
many cases excellent produce is grown in structures more or less
dilapidated. In some places movable greenhouses have been erected
for market purposes, so that the soil may be exposed to the sweetening
effect of the weather, when the glass roof is moved to an adjoining
patch.


Pits and Frames.&mdash;These are used both for the summer
growth and winter protection of various kinds of ornamental
plants, for the growth of such fruits as cucumbers, melons and
strawberries, and for the forcing of vegetables. When heat is
required, it is sometimes supplied by means of fermenting dung,
or dung and leaves, or tanner&rsquo;s bark, but it is much more economically
provided by hot-water pipes. Pits of many different
forms have been designed, but it may be sufficient here to
describe one or two which can be recommended for general
purposes.



Fig. 10.&mdash;Ventilated Plant Pit.


An excellent pit for wintering bedding-out plants or young greenhouse
stock is shown at fig. 10. It is built upon the pigeon-hole
principle as high as the
ground level a, a, and
above that in 9-in.
brickwork. At a distance
of 9 in. retaining
walls b, b are built up
to the ground level,
and the spaces between
the two are
covered by thick
boarding, which is to
be shut down as
shown at c in cold
weather to exclude
frost, and opened as
shown at d in mild
weather to promote
a free circulation of air through the pit. The height of the pit
might be reduced according to the size of the plants; and, to
secure the interior against frost, flow and return hot-water pipe e
should pass along beneath the staging, which should be a strong
wooden trellis supported by projections in the brickwork. The
water which drains from the plants or is spilt in watering would fall
on the bottom, which should be made porous to carry it away. For
many plants this under current of ventilation would be exceedingly
beneficial, especially when cold winds prevented the sashes from
being opened. A pit of this character may be sunk into the ground
deeper than is indicated in the figure if the subsoil is dry and gravelly,
bat in the case of a damp subsoil it should rather be more elevated,
as the soil could easily be sloped up to meet the retaining wall.



Fig. 11.&mdash;Hot-Bed Three-Light Frame.

Frames.&mdash;Frames (fig. 11) should be made of the best red deal,
1¼ in. thick. A convenient size is 6 ft. wide, 24 in. high at the back
and 15 in front; and they are usually 12 ft. long, which makes three
lights and sashes, though they can be made with two lights or one
light for particular purposes. Indeed, a one-light frame is often
found very convenient for many purposes. The lights should be
2 in. thick, and glazed with 21 oz. sheet glass, in broad panes four or
five to the breadth of a light, and of a length which will work in
conveniently and economically, very long panes being undesirable
from the havoc caused by accidents, and very short ones being
objectionable as multiplying the chances of drip, and the exclusion
of light by the numerous lappings; panes about 12 in. long are of
convenient size for garden lights of this character. In all gardens
the frames and lights should be of one size so as to be interchangeable,
and a good supply of extra lights (sashes) may always be turned to
good account for various purposes.



Fig. 12.&mdash;Span-Roof Frame.

Span-roof garden frame (fig. 12) may under some circumstances be
useful as a substitute for the three-light frame. It is adapted for
storing plants in winter, for nursing small plants in summer and for
the culture of melons and other crops requiring glass shelter. These
frames are made 11 in. high in front, 22 at the back and 32 at the
ridge, with ends of 1½-in. red deal; the sashes, which are 2 in. thick,
open by gearing, the front and back separately. The lights are
hinged so that they can be turned completely back when necessary.
This more direct and ready access to the plants within is one of the
principal recommendations of this form of pit.


Mushroom House.&mdash;Mushrooms may be grown in sheds and
cellars, or even in protected ridges in the open ground, but a
special structure is usually devoted to them. A lean-to against
the north side of the garden wall will be found suitable for the
purpose, though a span-roofed form may also be adopted,
especially if the building stands apart.



Fig. 13.&mdash;Lean-to Mushroom House.


The internal arrangement of a lean-to mushroom house is shown in
fig. 13. The length may vary from 30 ft. to 60 ft.; a convenient
width is 10 ft., which admits of a 3½ ft. central path, and beds 3 ft.
wide on each side. The
shelves should be of slate
a, a, supported by iron
uprights b, b, each half
having a front ledge of
bricks set on edge in
cement c, c. The slabs of
slate forming the shelves
should not be too closely
fitted, as a small interval
will prevent the accumulation
of moisture at the
bottom of the bed. They
may be supported by iron
standards or brick piers,
back and front, bearing
up a flat bar of iron on
which the slates may
rest; the use of the bar
will give wider intervals
between the supports,
which will be found convenient
for filling and
emptying the beds. The
roof may be tiled or
slated; but, to prevent
the injurious influence
of hot sun, there should
be an inner roof or ceiling
d, the space between
which and the outer roof
e should be packed with
sawdust. A hot-water pipe f should run along both sides of the
pathway, close to the front ledge of the lowest beds. The different
shelves can be planted in succession; and the lower ones, especially
those on the floor level, as being most convenient, can be utilized
for forcing sea-kale and rhubarb.


The Fruit Room.&mdash;This important store should be dark,
moderately dry, with a steady, moderately cool atmosphere,
752
and with the means of giving sufficient ventilation to keep the air
sweet. It should also be sufficiently commodious to permit of the
fruit being arranged in single layers on the shelves or trays. A
type of building which is becoming increasingly popular for this
purpose, and which is in many respects superior to the older, and
often more expensive structures, is built of wood, with or without
brick foundations, and is thickly thatched with reeds or other
non-conducting material externally&mdash;on walls and roof&mdash;while
the interior is matchboarded. Ventilation is afforded at the
ends, usually by tilting laths, operated by a cord. Two doors
are provided at one end&mdash;an inner, and an outer&mdash;the inner
being glazed at the top to admit light. They are generally span-roofed,
about 6 ft. high at the eaves, and 8 or 10 ft. high at the
ridge, according to width.


The length and breadth of these stores should be governed by the
amount and character of the storage accommodation to be provided.
If intended for storage only, a width of 9 ft. 6 in. would suffice, but if
intended to combine display with storage, the internal diameter
should be about 13 ft. In the former type, the walls are fitted with
four rows of shelves, about 3 ft. wide, and about 1 ft. 6 in. apart.
The shelves are of deal strips, 2 or 3 in. wide, laid about 1 in. apart
for ventilation. These are being superseded, however, by sliding-out
trays of convenient lengths and about 9 in. deep, working on fixed
framework. By this means the storage accommodation is nearly
doubled and the fruit is more easily manipulated. The central
gangway is about 3 ft. 6 in. wide. In the latter a central exhibition
bench about 3 ft. wide and of convenient height is provided. Gangways
2½ ft. wide flank this, while the shelves or drawers with which
the walls are fitted are about 2½ ft. wide.

Care of the Fruit Room.&mdash;This consists mainly in the storing only
of such fruits as are dry and in proper condition; in judicious
ventilation, especially in the presence of large quantities of newly-gathered
fruit; in the prompt removal of all decaying fruit; and in
the exclusion of vermin. It is also advisable to wash all woodwork
and gangways annually with a weak solution of formalin, or other
inodorous germicide.


Heating Apparatus.&mdash;Plant houses were formerly heated in
a variety of ways&mdash;by fermenting organic matter, such as dung,
by smoke flues, by steam and by hot water circulating in iron
pipes. The last-named method has proved so satisfactory in
practice that it is now in general use for all ordinary purposes.
The water is heated by a furnace, and is conveyed from the boiler
into the houses by a main or &ldquo;flow&rdquo; pipe, connected by means
of syphon branches with as many pipes as it is intended to serve.
When cooled it is returned to the boiler by another main or
&ldquo;return&rdquo; pipe. Heat is regulated in the structures by means of
valves on the various branch pipes. The flow pipe is attached
to the boiler at its highest point, to take the heated water as it
ascends. The return pipe is connected with the boiler at or near
its lowest point. The highest points of the pipes are fitted with
small taps, for the removal of air, which would retard circulation
if allowed to remain. Heating by hot water may be said to
depend, in part, on the influence of gravity on water being to
some extent overcome by heating in a boiler. It ascends the
flow pipe by convection, where its onward journey would
speedily end if it were not for the driving force of other molecules
of water following, and the suction set up by the gravitation into
the boiler of the cooled water by the return pipe. The power
of water to conduct heat is very low. The conducting power
of the iron in which it is conveyed is high. It is, however, probable
that conduction is to some extent a factor in the process.


Pipes.&mdash;It is a mistake to stint the quantity of piping, since it is
far more economical and better for the plants to have a larger
surface heated moderately than a smaller surface heated excessively.
In view of the fact that air expands, becomes lighter and rises, under
the influence of heat, the pipes should be set near the floor. If
intended to raise the temperature of the structure, they should be
set on iron or brick supports just clear of walls, earth or other heat-absorbing
bodies. Those intended to provide bottom heat, however,
are set in (a) water tanks running under the beds, or (b) in enclosed
dry chambers under the beds, or are (c) embedded in the soil or
plunging material. The first-named method is distinctly superior to
the others. Pipes of 2 in., 3 in., 4 in. and 6 in. diameters are mostly
used, the 4 in. size being the most convenient for general purposes.
The joints are packed or caulked with tow, smeared with a mixture
of white and red lead. Flanged joints are made to bolt together on
washers of vulcanized rubber.

Boilers.&mdash;There are numerous types of boilers in use, illustrative
of efforts to secure as much exposure as possible to the action of the
flames. The water-tube type, with multiple waterways, consists of a
number of separate tubes joined together in various ways. Some of
these are built in the form of a blunt cone, and are known as conical
tubular boilers. Others are built with the tubes arranged horizontally,
and are known as horizontal tubular boilers. The majority of
the latter are more or less saddle-shaped. Boilers with a single
waterway are of three principal types, the Cornish, the saddle and the
conical. The Cornish is cylindrical with the furnace occupying about
half the length of the cylinder. The saddle is so named from its
supposed resemblance to a saddle. It is set to span the furnace,
additional exposure to heat being secured in a variety of ways by
flues. Exposure in the conical boiler is direct on its inner surface,
and is supplemented by flues. Tubular boilers, especially the
horizontal types, are very powerful and economical. The Cornish
type is a rather slow and steady boiler, and is much used for providing
heat for large areas. The saddle boiler is very commonly
employed to provide heat for moderately sized and small areas.
Both are powerful and economical. Conical boilers are more expensive
to set by reason of their shape, and are not so convenient to
manipulate as the horizontal kinds. All the above types require a
setting of masonry. Portable boilers are convenient for heating
small areas, and are less expensive to install than those described
above. They are less economical, however, owing to loss of heat from
their exposed surfaces. What are called sectional boilers as used in
America and on the Continent are being introduced to British
gardens. Portions can be added or taken away according to the
amount of heating surface required.

Water Supply.&mdash;Wastage of water in the boilers should be made
good automatically from a cistern controlled by means of a ball-cock.
It should be placed as high above the boiler as practicable. The feed
should connect with the return pipe near the point at which it enters
the boiler.

Stokeholds.&mdash;These have usually to be excavated to admit of the
boilers being set below the level of the pipes they are intended to
serve. In consequence of their depth, the draining of stokeholds often
presents difficulties. Care should be taken to allow sufficient room
to properly manipulate the fires and to store fuel. It is important
that the ventilation should be as efficient as practicable, especially
where coke fuel is to be used.

Stoking.&mdash;The management of the furnaces is relatively easy, and
consists in adapting the volume and intensity of the fires to particular
needs. It involves the keeping dean of flues, ashpits and especially
the fires themselves. Where coke or ordinary hard coal are used, the
removal of clinkers should be done systematically, and the fires
stirred. Anthracite coal fires should not be stirred more than is
absolutely necessary, and should not be fed in driblets. They require
more draught than coke fires, but care must be taken not to give too
much, as excessive heat is likely to melt or soften the fire-bars.
Draught is regulated in the ashpit by opening or closing the bottom
door of the furnace and by the damper on the smoke shaft. The latter
must be of a fairly good height, according to circumstances, to secure
a good draught.

Solar Heat.&mdash;The importance of sun heat to the general well-being
of plant life, its influence on the production of flowers and the
ripening of edible fruits, has long been appreciated in horticulture.
The practice of &ldquo;closing up&rdquo; early in the afternoon, i.e. the closing
of ventilators (accompanied by syringing and damping of surfaces to
produce a humid atmosphere) has for its object the conservation of
as much solar heat as practicable.

Ventilation.&mdash;This consists in the admission of air for the purpose
of preventing stagnation of the atmosphere and for the regulation of
temperature. Means of affording ventilation in all plant houses
should be provided in at least two places&mdash;as near the floor as
practicable, and at the top. Mechanical contrivances whereby
whole sets of ventilators may be operated simultaneously are now
in common use, and are much more convenient and economical than
the older method of working each ventilator separately. Efficient
ventilating can only be effected by the exercise of common sense and
vigilance, and care must be taken to avoid cold draughts through the
houses.


III. Garden Materials and Appliances.

Soils and Composts.&mdash;The principal soils used in gardens,
either alone, or mixed to form what are called composts, are&mdash;loam,
sand, peat, leaf-mould and various mixtures and combinations
of these made up to suit the different subjects under
cultivation.

Loam is the staple soil for the gardener; it is not only used
extensively in the pure and simple state, but enters into most
of the composts prepared specially for his plants. For garden
purposes loam should be rather unctuous or soapy to the touch
when moderately dry, not too clinging nor adhesive, and should
readily crumble when a compressed handful is thrown on the
ground. If it clings together closely it is too heavy and requires
amelioration by the admixture of gritty material; if it has
little or no cohesion when squeezed tightly in the hand, it is
753
too light, and needs to be improved by the addition of heavier
or clayey material. Sound friable loam cut one sod deep from
the surface of a pasture, and stacked up for twelve months in
a heap or ridge, is invaluable to the gardener. When employed
for making vine borders, loam of a somewhat heavier nature can
be used with advantage, on account of the porous materials
which should accompany it. For stone fruits a calcareous
loam is best; indeed, for these subjects a rich calcareous loam
used in a pure and simple state cannot be surpassed. Somewhat
heavy loams are best for potting pine apples, for melons and
strawberries, fruit trees in pots, &amp;c., and may be used with the
addition of manures only; but for ornamental plants a loam
of a somewhat freer texture is preferable and more pleasant
to work. Loam which contains much red matter (iron) should
be avoided.

Sand is by itself of little value except for striking cuttings,
for which purpose fine clean sharp silver sand is the best; and
a somewhat coarser kind, if it is gritty, is to be preferred to
the comminuted sands which contain a large proportion of
earthy matter. River sand and the sharp grit washed up
sometimes by the road side are excellent materials for laying
around choice bulbs at planting time to prevent contact with
earth which is perhaps manure-tainted. Sea sand may be
advantageously used both for propagating purposes and for
mixing in composts. For the growth of pot plants sand is an
essential part of most composts, in order to give them the needful
porosity to carry off all excess of moisture from the roots. If
the finer earthy sands only are obtainable, they must be rendered
sharper by washing away the earthy particles. Washed sand
is best for all plants like heaths, which need a pure and lasting
peaty compost.

Peat soil is largely employed for the culture of such plants
as rhododendrons, azaleas, heaths, &amp;c. In districts where
heather and gritty soil predominate, the peat soil is poor and
unprofitable, but selections from both the heathy and the
richer peat soils, collected with judgment, and stored in a dry
part of the compost yard, are essential ingredients in the cultivation
of many choice pot plants, such as the Cape heaths and
many of the Australian plants. Many monocotyledons do well
in peat, even if they do not absolutely require it.

Leaf-mould is eminently suited for the growth of many free-growing
plants, especially when it has been mixed with stable
manure and has been subjected to fermentation for the formation
of hot beds. It any state most plants feed greedily upon
it, and when pure or free from decaying wood or sticks it is a
very safe ingredient in composts; but it is so liable to generate
fungus, and the mycelium or spawn of certain fungi is so injurious
to the roots of trees, attacking them if at all sickly or weakened
by drought, that many cultivators prefer not to mix leaf-mould
with the soil used for permanent plants, as peaches or choice
ornamental trees. For quick growing plants, however, as
for example most annuals cultivated in pots, such as balsams,
cockscombs, globe-amaranths and the like, for cucumbers,
and for young soft-wooded plants generally, it is exceedingly
useful, both by preventing the consolidation of the soil and as
a manure. The accumulations of light earth formed on the
surface in woods where the leaves fall and decay annually are
leaf-mould of the finest quality. Leaves collected in the autumn
and stored in pits or heaps, and covered with a layer of soil,
make beautiful leaf-mould at the end of about twelve months,
if frequently drenched with water or rain during this period.

Composts are mixtures of the foregoing ingredients in varying
proportions, and in combination with manures if necessary,
so as to suit particular plants or classes of plants. The chief
point to be borne in mind in making these mixtures is not to
combine in the same compost any bodies that are antagonistic
in their nature, as for example lime and ammonia. In making
up composts for pot plants, the fibrous portion should not be
removed by sifting, except for small-sized pots, but the turfy
portions should be broken up by hand and distributed in smaller
or larger lumps throughout the mass. When sifting is had
recourse to, the fibrous matter should be rubbed through the
meshes of the sieve along with the earthy particles. Before being
used the turfy ingredients of composts should lie together in
a heap only long enough for the roots of the herbage to die, not
to decompose.

Manures (see Manure).&mdash;These are of two classes, organic
and inorganic&mdash;the former being of animal and vegetable, the
latter of mineral origin. The following are organic manures:


Farm-yard manure consists of the mixed dung of horses and cattle
thrown together, and more or less soaked with liquid drainings of the
stable or byre. It is no doubt the finest stimulant for the growth of
plants, and that most adapted to restore the fertile elements which
the plants have abstracted from exhausted soils. This manure is
best fitted for garden use when in a moderately fermented state.

Horse dung is generally the principal ingredient in all hot bed
manure; and, in its partially decomposed state, as afforded by exhausted
hot beds, it is well adapted for garden use. It is most
beneficial on cold stiff soils. It should not be allowed to lie too long
unmoved when fresh, as it will then heat violently, and the ammonia
is thus driven off. To avoid this, it should be turned over two or
three times if practicable, and well moistened&mdash;preferably with
farm-yard drainings.

Cow dung is less fertilizing than horse dung, but being slower in
its action it is more durable; it is also cooler, and therefore better
for hot dry sandy soils. Thoroughly decayed, it is one of the best of
all manures for mixing in composts for florists&rsquo; flowers and other
choice plants.

Pig dung is very powerful, containing more nitrogen than horse
dung; it is therefore desirable that it should undergo moderate
fermentation, which will be secured by mixing it with litter and a
portion of earth. When weeds are thrown to the pigs, this fermentation
becomes specially desirable to kill their seeds.

Night-soil is an excellent manure for all bulky crops, but requires
to be mixed with earth or peat, or coal-ashes, so as both to deodorize
it and to ensure its being equally distributed. Quicklime should not
be used, as it dispels the greater part of the ammonia. When
prepared by drying and mixing with various substances, night-soil
is sold as desiccated night-soil or native guano, the value of which
depends upon the materials used for admixture.

Malt-dust is an active manure frequently used as a top-dressing,
especially for fruit trees in pots. It is rapid in its action, but its
effects are not very permanent. Rape dust is somewhat similar in its
character and action.

Bones are employed as a manure with decided advantage both to
vegetable crops and to fruit trees, as well as to flowers. For turnips
bone manure is invaluable. The effects of bones are no doubt
mainly due to the phosphates they contain, and they are most
effectual on dry soils. They are most quickly available when dissolved
in sulphuric acid.

Guano is a valuable manure now much employed, and may be
applied to almost every kind of crop with decided advantage. It
should be mixed with six or eight times its weight of loam or ashes,
charred peat, charcoal-dust or some earthy matter, before it is
applied to the soil, as from its causticity it is otherwise not unlikely
to kill or injure the plants to which it is administered. Peruvian
guano is obtained from the excreta of South American sea-birds, and
fish guano from the waste of fish. Both are remarkable for the
quantity of nitrates and phosphates they contain.

Pigeon dung approaches guano in its power as manure. It should
be laid up in ridges of good loamy soil in alternate layers to form a
compost, which becomes a valuable stimulant for any very choice
subjects if cautiously used. The dung of the domestic fowl is very
similar in character.

Horn, hoof-parings, woollen rags, fish, blubber and blood, after treatment
with sulphuric acid, are all good manures, and should be utilized
if readily obtainable.

Liquid manure, consisting of the drainings of dung-heaps, stables,
cowsheds, &amp;c., or of urine collected from dwelling houses or other
sources, is a most valuable and powerful stimulant, and can be
readily applied to the roots of growing plants. The urine should be
allowed to putrefy, as in its decomposition a large amount of ammonia
is formed, which should then be fixed by sulphuric acid or gypsum;
or it may be applied to the growing crops after being freely diluted
with water or absorbed in a compost heap. Liquid manures can be
readily made from most of the solid manures when required, simply
by admixture with water. When thus artificially compounded,
unless for immediate use, they should be made strong for convenience
of storage, and applied as required much diluted.

The following are inorganic manures:

Ammonia is the most powerful and one of the most important of
the constituents of manures generally, since it is the chief source
whence plants derive their nitrogen. It is largely supplied in all the
most fertilizing of organic manures, but when required in the inorganic
state must be obtained from some of the salts of ammonia, as
the sulphate, the muriate or the phosphate, all of which, being
extremely energetic, require to be used with great caution. These
salts of ammonia may be used at the rate of from 2 to 3 cwt. per acre
as a top-dressing in moist weather. When dissolved in water they
754
form active liquid manures. The most commonly used nitrogenous
manures are nitrate of soda, nitrate of potash and sulphate of
ammonia, the prices of which are constantly fluctuating.

Potash and soda are also valuable inorganic manures in the form
of carbonates, sulphates, silicates and phosphates, but the most
valuable is the nitrate of potash. The price, however, is generally so
high that its use is practically nil, except in small doses as a liquid
manure for choice pot plants. Cheaper substitutes, however, are
now found in sulphate of potash, and muriate of potash and kainit.
The two last-named must not be applied direct to growing crops, but
to the soil some weeks in advance of sowing or cropping. The
manures of this class are of course of value only in cases where the
soil is naturally deficient in them. On this account the salts of soda
are of less importance than those of potash. The value of wood ashes
as a manure very much depends upon the carbonate and other
salts of potash which they contain.

Phosphoric acid, in the form of phosphates, is a most valuable
plant food, and is absorbed by most plants in fairly large quantities
from the soil. It induces the earlier production of flowers and
fruits. In a natural state it is obtained from bones, guano and
wood ashes; and in an artificial condition from basic slag or Thomas&rsquo;s
phosphate, coprolites and superphosphate of lime.

Lime in the caustic state is beneficially applied to soils which
contain an excess of inert vegetable matter, and hence may be used
for the improvement of old garden soils saturated with humus, or
of peaty soils not thoroughly reclaimed. It does not supply the
place of organic manures, but only renders that which is present
available for the nourishment of the plants. It also improves the
texture of clay soils.

Gypsum, or sulphate of lime, applied as a top-dressing at the rate
of 2 to 3 cwt. per acre, has been found to yield good results,
especially on light soils. It is also employed in the case of liquid
manures to fix the ammonia.

Gas lime, after it has been exposed to the air for a few months is
an excellent manure on heavy soils. In a fresh state it is poisonous
and fatal to vegetation, and is often used for this reason to dress land
infested with wireworms, grubs, club-root fungus, &amp;c.

Burnt clay has a very beneficial effect on clay land by improving
its texture and rendering soluble the alkaline substances it contains.
The clay should be only slightly burnt, so as to make it crumble
down readily; in fact, the fire should not be allowed to break
through, but should be constantly repressed by the addition of
material. The burning should be effected when the soil is dry.

Vegetable refuse of all kinds, when smother-burned in a similar
way, becomes a valuable mechanical improver of the soil; but the
preferable course is to decompose it in a heap with quicklime and
layers of earth, converting it into leaf-mould. Potato haulms, and
club-rooted cabbage crops should, however, never be mixed with
ordinary clean vegetable refuse, as they would be most likely to
perpetuate the terrible diseases to which they are subject. The
refuse of such plants should be burned as early as possible. The ash
may be used as manure.

Soot forms a good top-dressing; it consists principally of charcoal,
but contains ammonia and a smaller proportion of phosphates and
potash, whence its value as a manure is derived. It should be kept
dry until required for use. It may also be used beneficially in preventing
the attacks of insects, such as the onion gnat and turnip fly,
by dusting the plants or dressing the ground with it.

Common salt acts as a manure when used in moderate quantities,
but in strong doses is injurious to vegetation. It suits many of
the esculent crops, as onions, beans, cabbages, carrots, beet-root,
asparagus, &amp;c.; the quantity applied varies from 5 to 10 bushels
per acre. It is used as a top-dressing sown by the hand. Hyacinths
and other bulbs derive benefit from slight doses, while to asparagus
as much as 20 &#8468; to the rood has been used with beneficial effect.
At the rate of from 6 to 10 bushels to the acre it may be used on
garden lawns to prevent worm casts. For the destruction of weeds
on gravel walks or in paved yards a strong dose of salt, applied
either dry or in a very strong solution, is found very effective,
especially a hot solution, but after a time much of it becomes washed
down, and the residue acts as a manure; its continued application is
undesirable, as gravel so treated becomes pasty.


Garden Tools, &amp;c.&mdash;Most of these are so well known that we
shall not discuss them here. They are, moreover, illustrated
and described in the catalogues of most nurserymen and dealers
in horticultural sundries.

Tallies or Labels.&mdash;The importance of properly labelling plants
can hardly be over-estimated. For ordinary purposes labels of
wood of various sizes (sold in bundles) are the most convenient.
These should be wiped with a little white paint or linseed oil, and
written with a soft lead pencil before the surface becomes dry.
Copying-ink pencils should not be used, as water will wash away
the writing. For permanent plants, as trees, roses, &amp;c., metallic
labels with raised type are procurable from dealers, and are
neat, durable and convenient. Permanent labels may also be
made from sheet lead, the names being punched in by means
of steel type. For stove and greenhouse plants, orchids, ferns,
&amp;c., labels made of xylonite, zinc and other materials are
also used.

IV. Garden Operations.

Propagation.&mdash;The increase of plants, so far as the production
of new individuals of particular kinds is concerned, is one of
the most important and constantly recurring of gardening operations.
In effecting this, various processes are adopted, which
will now be described.


1. By Seeds.&mdash;This may be called the natural means of increasing
the number of any particular kind of plant, but it is to be remembered
that we do not by that means secure an exact reproduction
of the parent, especially in the case of plants raised or evolved in the
course of generations by hybridization and selection. We may get
a progeny very closely resembling it, yet each plant possessing a
distinct individuality of its own; or we may get a progeny very
unlike the parent, or a mixed progeny showing various degrees of
divergence. Many seeds will grow freely if sown in a partially
ripened state; but as a general rule seeds have to be kept for some
weeks or months in store, and hence they should be thoroughly
ripened before being gathered. They should be sown in fine rich soil,
and such as will not readily get consolidated. In the case of outdoor
crops, if the soil is inclined to be heavy, it is a good plan to cover all
the smaller seeds with a light compost. Very small seeds should only
have a sprinkling of light earth or of sand, and sometimes only a thin
layer of soft moss to exclude light and preserve an equable degree
of moisture. Somewhat larger seeds sown indoors may be covered
to the depth of one-eighth or one-fourth of an inch, according to
their size. Outdoor crops require to be sown, the smaller seeds
from ½ to 1 in., and the larger ones from 2 to 4 in. under the
surface, the covering of the smaller ones especially being light
and open. Many seeds grow well when raked in; that is, the
surface on which they are scattered is raked backwards and forwards
until most of them are covered. Whatever the seeds, the ground
should be made tolerably firm both beneath and above them; this
may be done by treading in the case of most kitchen garden crops,
which are also better sown in drills, this admitting the more readily
of the ground being kept clear from weeds by hoeing. All seeds
require a certain degree of heat to induce germination. For tropical
plants the heat of a propagating house&mdash;75° to 80°, with a bottom
heat of 80° to 90°&mdash;is desirable, and in many cases absolutely
necessary; for others, such as half-hardy annuals, a mild hot bed,
or a temperate pit ranging from 60° to 70°, is convenient; while of
course all outdoor crops have to submit to the natural temperature
of the season. It is very important that seeds should be sown when
the ground is in a good working condition, and not clammy with
moisture.

2. By Offsets.&mdash;This mode of increase applies specially to bulbous
plants, such as the lily and hyacinth, which produce little bulbs on
the exterior round their base. Most bulbs do so naturally to a
limited but variable extent; when more rapid increase is wanted the
heart is destroyed, and this induces the formation of a larger number
of offsets. The stem bulbs of lilies are similar in character to the
offsets from the parent bulb. The same mode of increase occurs in
the gladiolus and crocus, but their bulb-like permanent parts are
called corms, not bulbs. After they have ripened in connexion with
the parent bulb, the offsets are taken off, stored in appropriate
places, and at the proper season planted out in nursery beds.

3. By Tubers.&mdash;The tuber is a fleshy underground stem, furnished
with eyes which are either visible, as in the potato and in some
familiar kinds of Tropaeolum (T. tuberosum) and of Oxalis (O. crenata),
or latent, as in the Chinese yam (Dioscorea Batatas). When used
for propagation, the tubers are cut up into what are called &ldquo;sets,&rdquo;
every portion having an eye attached being capable of forming an
independent plant. The cut portions of bulky sets should be suffered
to lie a short time before being planted, in order to dry the surface
and prevent rotting; this should not, however, be done with such
tropical subjects as caladiums, the tubers of which are often cut up
into very small fragments for propagation, and of course require to
be manipulated in a properly heated propagating pit. No eyes are
visible in the Chinese yam, but slices of the long club-shaped tubers
will push out young shoots and form independent plants, if planted
with ordinary care.

4. By Division.&mdash;Division, or partition, is usually resorted to in
the case of tufted growing plants, chiefly perennial herbs; they
may be evergreen, as chamomile or thrift, or when dormant may
consist only of underground crowns, as larkspur or lily-of-the-valley;
but in either case the old tufted plant being dug up may
be divided into separate pieces, each furnished with roots, and,
when replanted, generally starting on its own account without much
check. Suffruticose plants and even small shrubs may be propagated
in this way, by first planting them deeper than they are ordinarily
grown, and then after the lapse of a year, which time they require to
get rooted, taking them up again and dividing them into parts or
separate plants. Box-edging and southernwood are examples.
The same ends may sometimes be effected by merely working fine
755
soil in amongst the base of the stems, and giving them time to throw
out roots before parting them.

5. By Suckers.&mdash;Root suckers are young shoots from the roots of
plants, chiefly woody plants, as may often be seen in the case of the
elm and the plum. The shoots when used for propagation must be
transplanted with all the roots attached to them, care being taken
not to injure the parent plant. If they spring from a thick root it is
not to be wantonly severed, but the soil should be removed and the
sucker taken off by cutting away a clean slice of the root, which will
then heal and sustain no harm. Stem suckers are such as proceed
from the base of the stem, as is often seen in the case of the currant
and lilac. They should be removed in any case; when required for
propagation they should be taken with all the roots attached to
them, and they should be as thoroughly disbudded below ground as
possible, or they are liable to continue the habit of suckering. In
this case, too, the soil should be carefully opened and the shoots removed
with a suckering iron, a sharp concave implement with long
iron handle (fig. 14). When the number of roots is limited, the tops
should be shortened, and some care in watering and mulching should
be bestowed on the plant if it is of value.



Fig. 14.&mdash;Suckering Iron.

6. By Runners.&mdash;The young string-like shoots produced by the
strawberry are a well-known example of runners. The process of
rooting these runners should be facilitated by fixing them close down
to the soil, which is done by small wooden hooked pegs or by stones;
hair-pins, short lengths of bent wire, &amp;c., may also be used. After
the roots are formed, the strings are cut through, and the runners
become independent plants.

7. By Proliferous Buds.&mdash;Not unlike the runner, though growing
in a very different way, are the bud-plants formed on the fronds of
several kinds of ferns belonging to the genera Asplenium, Woodwardia,
Polystichum, Lastrea, Adiantum, Cystopteris, &amp;c. In some of these
(Adiantum caudatum, Polystichum lepidocaulon) the rachis of the
frond is lengthened out much like the string of the strawberry
runner, and bears a plant at its apex. In others (Polystichum
angulare proliferum) the stipes below and the rachis amongst the
pinnae develop buds, which are often numerous and crowded. In
others again (Woodwardia orientalis, Asplenium bulbiferum), buds are
numerously produced on the upper surface of the fronds. These will
develop on the plant if allowed to remain. For propagation the
buibiferous portion is pegged down on the surface of a pot of suitable
soil; if kept close in a moist atmosphere, the little buds will soon
strike root and form independent plants. In Cystopteris the buds
are deciduous, falling off as the fronds acquire maturity, but, if
collected and pressed into the surface of a pot of soil and kept close,
they will grow up into young plants the following season. In some
genera of flowering plants, and notably in Bryophyllum, little plants
form on various parts of the leaves. In some Monocotyledons, ordinarily
in Chlorophytum, and exceptionally in Phalaenopsis and others,
new plants arise on the flower stems.



Fig. 15.&mdash;Propagation by Layers&mdash;a, tonguing; b, ringing.

8. By Layers.&mdash;Layering consists in preparing the branch of a
plant while still attached to the parent, bending it so that the part
operated on is brought under ground, and then fixing it there by
means of a forked peg. Some plants root so freely that they need
only pegging down; but in most cases the arrest of the returning sap
to form a callus, and ultimately young roots, must be brought about
artificially, either by twisting the branch, by splitting it, by girding
it closely with wire, by taking off a ring of bark, or by &ldquo;tonguing.&rdquo;
In tonguing the leaves are cut off the portion which has to be brought
under ground, and a tongue or slit is then cut from below upwards
close beyond a joint, of such length that, when the cut part of the
layer is pegged an inch or two (or in larger woody subjects 3 or 4 in.)
below the surface, the elevation of the point of the shoot to an upright
position may open the incision, and thus set it free, so that it may
be surrounded by earth to induce it to form roots. The whole
branch, except a few buds at the extremity, is covered with soil.
The best seasons for these operations are early spring and mid-summer,
that is, before the sap begins to flow, and after the first
flush of growth has passed off. One whole summer, sometimes two,
must elapse before the layers will be fully rooted in the case of woody
plants; but such plants as carnations and picotees, which are
usually propagated in this way, in favourable seasons take only a
few weeks to root, as they are layered towards the end of the blooming
season in July, and are taken off and planted separately early in
the autumn. Fig. 15 shows a woody plant with one layer prepared
by tonguing and another by ringing.

In general, each shoot makes one layer, but in plants like the
Wistaria or Clematis, which make long shoots, what is called serpentine
layering may be adopted; that is, the shoot is taken alternately
below and above the surface, as frequently as its length permits.
There must, however, be a joint at the underground part where it is
to be tongued and pegged, and at least one sound bud in each exposed
part, from which a shoot may be developed to form the top of
the young plant.

9. By Circumposition.&mdash;When a plant is too high or its habit does
not conveniently admit of its being layered, it may often be increased
by what is called circumposition, the soil being carried up to the
branch operated on. The branch is to be prepared by ringing or
notching or wiring as in layering, and a temporary stand made to
support the vessel which is to contain the soil. The vessel may be a
flower-pot sawn in two, so that the halves may be bound together
when used, or it may be a flower-pot or box with a side slit which
will admit the shoot; this vessel is to be filled compactly with suitable
porous earth, the opening at the slit being stopped by pieces of
slate or tile. The earth must be kept moist, which is perhaps best
done by a thick mulching of moss, the moss being also bound closely
over the openings in the vessel, and all being kept damp by frequent
syringings. Gardeners often dispense with the pot, using sphagnum
moss and leaf-mould only when propagating india-rubber plants,
perpetual carnations, dracaenas, &amp;c.

10. By Grafts.&mdash;Grafting is so extensively resorted to that it is impossible
here to notice all its phases. It is perhaps of most importance
as the principal means of propagating our hardy kinds of fruit,
especially the apple and the pear; but the process is the same with
most other fruits and ornamental hardy trees and shrubs that are
thus propagated. The stocks are commonly divided into two
classes:&mdash;(1) free stocks, which consist of seedling plants, chiefly
of the same genus or species as the trees from which the scions are
taken; and (2) dwarfing stocks, which are of more diminutive
growth, either varieties of the same species or species of the same or
some allied genus as the scion, which have a tendency to lessen the
expansion of the engrafted tree. The French Paradise is the best
dwarfing stock for apples, and the quince for pears. In determining
the choice of stocks, the nature of the soil in which the grafted trees
are to grow should have full weight. In a soil, for example, naturally
moist, it is proper to graft pears on the quince, because this plant
not only thrives in such a soil, but serves to check the luxuriance
thereby produced. The scions should always be ripened portions of
the wood of the preceding year, selected from healthy parents; in
the case of shy-bearing kinds, it is better to obtain them from the
fruitful branches. The scions should be taken off some weeks before
they are wanted, and half-buried in the earth, since the stock at the
time of grafting should in point of vegetation be somewhat in advance
of the graft. During winter, grafts may be conveyed long distances,
if carefully packed. If they have been six weeks or two months
separated from the parent plant, they should be grafted low on the
stock, and the earth should be ridged up round them, leaving only
one bud of the scion exposed above ground. The best season for
grafting apples and similar hardy subjects in the open air is in March
and April; but it may be commenced as soon as the sap in the stock
is fairly in motion.

Whip-grafting or Tongue-grafting (fig. 16) is the most usual mode
of performing the operation when there is no great difference in
thickness between the stock and scion. The stock is headed off by
an oblique transverse cut as shown at a, a slice is then pared off the
side as at b, and on the face of this a tongue or notch is made, the cut
being in a downward direction; the scion c is pared off in a similar
way by a single clean sharp cut, and this is notched or tongued in the
opposite direction as the figure indicates; the two are then fitted
together as shown at d, so that the inner bark of each may come in
contact at least on one side, and then tied round with damp soft
bast as at e; next some grafting clay is taken on the forefinger and
pushed down on each side so as to fill out the space between the
top of the stock and the graft, and a portion is also rubbed over
the ligatures on the side where the graft is placed, a handful of the
clay is then taken, flattened out, and rolled closely round the whole
point of junction, being finished off to a tapering form both above and
below, as shown by the dotted line f. To do this deftly, the hands
should be plunged from time to time in dry ashes, to prevent the clay
from sticking to them. Various kinds of grafting wax are now
obtainable, and are a great improvement upon the clay process.
Some cold mastics become very pliable with the warmth of the hands.
They are best applied with a piece of flat wood; or very liquid waxes
may be applied with a brush.

756



Fig. 16.&mdash;Whip-grafting or Tongue-grafting.

Cleft-grafting (fig. 17) is another method in common use. The
stock a is cleft down from the horizontal cut d (but not nearly so
much as the sketch would indicate), and the scion, when cut to a thin
wedge form, as shown at c and e, is inserted into the cleft; the whole
is then bound up and clayed as in the former case. This is not so
good a plan as whip-grafting; it is improved by sloping the stock
on one side to the size of the graft.



Fig. 17.&mdash;Cleft-grafting.
Fig. 18.&mdash;Crown-Grafting.

Crown-grafting or Rind-grafting (fig. 18) is preferable to cleft-grafting,
inasmuch as it leaves no open spaces in the wood. The
stock b is cut off horizontally or nearly so in January or February.
At grafting time a slit is cut in the bark f, f, a wedge-shaped piece of
iron or a small chisel being inserted to raise the bark; the scion is
then cut to the same wedge-shaped form g, h, and inserted in the space
opened for it between the alburnum and the bark, after which it is
tied down and clayed or waxed over in the manner already described.

Side-grafting is performed like whip-grafting, the graft being
inserted on the side of a branch and not at the cut end of the stock.
It may be practised for the purpose of changing a part of the tree,
and is sometimes very useful for filling out vacant spaces, in trained
trees especially.

Inarching is another form of side-grafting. Here the graft is fixed
to the side of the stock, which is planted or potted close to the plant
to be worked. The branches are applied to the stock while yet
attached to the parent tree, and remain so until united. In the
case of trained trees, a young shoot is sometimes inarched to its
parent stem to supply a branch where one has not been developed
in the ordinary way.

For the propagation by grafts of stove and greenhouse plants the
process adopted is whip-grafting or a modification of it. The parts
are, however, sometimes so small that the tongue of the graft is
dispensed with, and the two stems simply pared smooth and bound
together. In this way hardy rhododendrons of choice sorts, greenhouse
azaleas, the varieties of the orange family, camellias, roses, rare
conifers, clematises and numerous other plants are increased.
Raffia&mdash;which has taken the place of bast&mdash;is generally used for
tying, and grafting wax is only used occasionally with such plants
under glass. All grafting of this kind is done in the propagating
house, at any season when grafts are obtainable in a fit state&mdash;the
plants when operated on being placed in close frames warmed to a
suitable temperature. Roses and clematis, however, are generally
grafted from January to March and April.

Root-grafting is sometimes resorted to where extensive increase is
an object, or where stem-grafting or other means of propagation are
not available. In this case the scion is grafted directly on to a
portion of the root of some appropriate stock, both graft and stock
being usually very small; the grafted root is then potted so as to
cover the point of junction with the soil, and is plunged in the bed
of the propagating house, where it gets the slight stimulus of a
gentle bottom heat. Dahlias (fig. 19), paeonies, and Wistarias may be
grafted by inserting young shoots into the neck of one of the fleshy
roots of each kind respectively&mdash;the best method of doing so being
to cut a triangular section near the upper end of the root, just large
enough to admit the young shoot when slightly pared away on two
sides to give it a similar form. In the case of large woody plants thus
worked (fig. 20) the grafted roots, after the operation is completed,
are planted in nursery beds, so that the upper buds only are exposed
to the atmosphere, as shown in the figure.

11. By Buds.&mdash;Budding is the inserting of a bud of a choice variety
cut with a portion of bark into the bark of the stock of an inferior
nature where it is bound gently but firmly. Stone fruits, such as
peaches, apricots, plums, cherries, &amp;c., are usually propagated in this
way, as well as roses and many other plants. In the propagating
house budding may be done at any season when the sap is in motion;
but for fruit trees, roses, &amp;c., in the open air, it is usually done in July
or August, when the buds destined for the following year are completely
formed in the axils of the leaves, and when the bark separates
freely from the wood it covers. Those buds are to be preferred, as
being best ripened, which occur on the middle portion of a young
shoot, and which are quite dormant at the time.



Fig. 21.&mdash;Shield-budding.

The simplest and most generally practised form of budding is that
called shield-budding or T-budding (fig. 21). The operator should be
provided with a sharp budding knife having a thin ivory or bone
handle, for raising the bark of the stock. A horizontal incision is
made in the bark quite down to the wood, and from this a perpendicular
slit is drawn upwards to the extent of perhaps an inch, so that
the slit has a resemblance to the letter T, as at a. A bud is then cut
by a clean incision from the tree intended to be propagated, having a
portion of the wood attached to it, and so that the whole may be
about 1 in. long, as at d. The bit of wood e must be gently withdrawn,
care being taken that the bud adheres wholly to the bark or shield,
757
as it is called, of which f is a side view. The bark on each side of the
perpendicular slit being then cautiously opened, as at b, with the
handle of the knife, the bud and shield are inserted as shown at c.
The upper tip of the shield is cut off horizontally, and brought to fit
the bark of the stock at the transverse incision. Slight ties of soft
cotton wool or worsted, or moist raffia, are then applied. In about a
month or six weeks the ligatures may be removed or slit with the
knife to allow for the swelling stem, when, if the operation has been
successful, the bud will be fresh and full, and the shield firmly
united to the wood. In the following spring a strong shoot will be
thrown out, and to prevent its being blown out by the wind, must be
fastened to a stake, or to the lower portion of the old stock which
has been left for the purpose.

To be successful the operation should be performed with a quick
and light hand, so that no part of the delicate tissues be injured, as
would happen if they were left for a time exposed, or if the bud were
forced in like a wedge. The union is effected as in grafting, by means
of the organizable sap or cambium, and the less this is disturbed until
the inner bark of the shield is pressed and fixed against it the better.
Trees to be grown in the form of a bush are usually budded low down
on the stem of the stock as near the root as possible to obviate the
development of wild suckers later on. Standard trees, however, are
budded on a sturdy young shoot close to the top. In either case the
stocks should have been carefully planted at least the previous
November when the work is to be done in the open air the following
July or August.



Fig. 22.&mdash;Propagation by Cuttings.

12. By Branch Cuttings.&mdash;Propagation by cuttings is the mode
of increase most commonly adopted, next to that by seeds. It is
effected by taking a portion from a branch or shoot of the plant,
and placing it in the soil. There are great differences to be observed
in the selection and treatment of cuttings. Sometimes soft green
leafy shoots, as in Verbena (fig. 22, a), are used; sometimes the shoots
must be half-ripened, and sometimes fully matured. So of the mode
of preparation; some will root if cut off or broken off at any point
and thrust into wet earth or sand in a warm place (fig. 22, a); others
require to be cut with the utmost care just below a joint or leaf-base,
and by a keen blade so as to sever the tissues without tearing or
bruising; and others again after being cut across may be split up for
a short distance, but there seems to be no particular virtue in this.
It is usual and in most cases necessary to cut away the lower portion
of a cutting up to just below the node or joint (fig. 22, b, d, e). The
internodal parts will not often divide so as to form separate individual
plants; sometimes, however, this happens; it is said that the
smallest piece of Torenia asiatica, for instance, will grow. Then as to
position, certain cuttings grow readily enough if planted outdoors in
the open soil, some preferring shade, others sunshine, while less
hardy subjects must be covered with a bell-glass, or must be in a close
atmosphere with bottom heat, or must have the aid of pure silver
sand to facilitate their rooting (fig. 22, c). Cuttings should in all
cases be taken from healthy plants, and from shoots of a moderate
degree of vigour. It is also important to select leafy growths, and
not such as will at once run up to flower. Young shoots which have
become moderately firm generally make the best cuttings, but sometimes
the very softest shoots strike more readily. For all indoor
plants in a growing state spring is a good time for taking cuttings, but
at any time during the summer months is also favourable if cuttings
are obtainable.

Cuttings of deciduous plants should be taken off after the fall
of the leaf. These cuttings should be about 6 in. to 1 ft. in length, and
should be planted at once in the ground so as to leave only the top
with the two or three preserved buds exposed. If a clean stem,
however, is desired, a longer portion may be left uncovered. Gooseberries,
currants, roses and many hardy deciduous trees and shrubs
are easily propagated in this way if the cuttings are inserted in well-drained
soil about the end of October or early in November.

Cuttings of growing plants are prepared by removing with a sharp
knife, and moderately close, the few leaves which would otherwise
be buried in the soil; they are then cut clean across just below a
joint; the fewer the leaves thus removed, however, the better,
as if kept from being exhausted they help to supply the elaborated
sap out of which the roots are formed. Free-rooting subjects strike
in any lightish sandy mixture; but difficult subjects should have
thoroughly well-drained pots, a portion of the soil proper for the
particular plants made very sandy, and a surfacing of clean sharp
silver sand about as deep as the length of the cutting.



Fig. 23.&mdash;Leaf Cuttings.

Such difficult plants as heaths are reared in silver sand, a stratum
of which is placed over the sandy peat soil in a specially prepared
cutting pot, and
thus the cuttings,
though rooting in
the sand under a
bell-glass, find at
once on the emission
of roots congenial
soil for
them to grow in
(fig. 22, c).

Hardy plants,
such as pinks,
pansies, &amp;c., are
propagated by
cuttings planted
during early summer
in light rich
soil. The cuttings
of pinks are called
pipings (fig. 22, d),
and are planted
about June, while
pansies may be
renewed in this
way both in spring
and in autumn.

13. By Leaf
Cuttings.&mdash;Many
plants may be propagated
by planting
their leaves or portions of the leaves as cuttings, as, for example,
the Gloxinia (fig. 23, a) and Gesnera, the succulent Sempervivum,
Echeveria, Pachyphytum and their allies, and such hard-leaved plants
as Theophrasta (fig. 23, b). The leaves are best taken off with the
base whole, and should be planted in well-drained sandy soil; in
due time they form roots, and ultimately from some latent bud
a little shoot which forms the young plant. The treatment is
precisely like that of branch cuttings. Gloxinias, begonias, &amp;c., grow
readily from fragments of the leaves cut clean through the thick
veins and ribs, and planted edgewise like cuttings. This class of
subjects may also be fixed flat on the surface of the cutting pot, by
means of little pegs or hooks, the
main ribs being cut across at intervals,
and from these points roots,
and eventually young tubers, will be
produced (fig. 24).



Fig. 24.&mdash;Leaf-Propagation of Begonia.

14. By Root Cuttings.&mdash;Some
plants which are not easily increased
by other means propagate readily
from root cuttings. Amongst the
indoor plants which may be so
treated, Bouvardia, Pelargonium,
Aralia and Wigandia may be mentioned.
The modus operandi is to
turn the plant out of its pot,
shake away the soil so as to free
the roots, and then select as many pieces of the stouter roots as may
be required. These are cut up into half-inch lengths (more or less),
and inserted in light sandy soil round the margin of a cutting pot, so
that the upper end of the root cutting may be level with the soil or
only just covered by it. The pots should be watered so as to settle the
soil, and be placed in the close atmosphere of the propagating pit or
frame, where they will need scarcely any water until the buds are
seen pushing through the surface.

There are various herbaceous plants which may be similarly
treated, such as sea-kale and horseradish, and, among ornamental
plants, the beautiful autumn-blooming Anemone japonica, Bocconia
cordata, Dictamnus Fraxinella&mdash;the burning bush; the sea hollies
(Eryngium), the globe thistle (Echinops ritro), the Oriental poppy
(Papaver orientale), the sea lavender (Statice latifolia), Senecio pulcher,
&amp;c. The sea-kale and horseradish require to be treated in the open
garden, where the cut portions should be planted in lines in well-worked
soil; but the roots of the others should be planted in pots
and kept in a close frame with a little warmth till the young shoots
have started.

Various hardy ornamental trees are also increased in this way, as
the quince, elm, robinia and mulberry, and the rose amongst shrubs.
The most important use to which this mode of propagation is put is,
however, the increase of roses, and of the various plums used as
stocks for working the choicer stone fruits. The method in the
latter case is to select roots averaging the thickness of the little
finger, to cut these into lengths of about 3 or 4 in., and to plant them
758
in lines just beneath the surface in nursery beds. The root cuttings
of rose-stocks are prepared and treated in a similar way.



Fig. 25.&mdash;Cutting of Single Eye.

15. By Cuttings of Single Eyes.&mdash;This mode of propagation is
by cutting the ripened young branches into short lengths, each containing
one well-matured bud or eye, with a short portion of the
stem above and below.
It is a common mode of
propagating vines, the
eyes being in this case
cut from the ripened
leafless wood. The eyes
(fig. 25, a) are planted
just below the surface in
pots of light soil, which
are placed in a hot bed
or propagating pit, and
in due time each pushes
up a young shoot which
forms the future stem,
while from about its
base the young roots are
produced (fig. 25, b)
which convert it into
an independent plant.
In the case of plants
with persistent leaves,
the stem may be cut
through just above and
below the bud, retaining
the leaf which is left on
the cutting, the old
wood and eye being
placed beneath the soil
and the leaf left exposed.
In this way the
india-rubber tree (Ficus
elastica), for example,
and many other tender
plants may be increased
with the aid of a brisk
bottom heat. Many of
the free-growing soft-wooded plants may also be grown from cuttings
of single joints of the young wood, where rapid increase is
desired; and in the case of opposite-leaved plants two cuttings
may often be made from one joint by splitting the stem longitudinally,
each cutting consisting of a leaf and a perfect bud
attached to half the thickness of the stem.


Planting and Transplanting.&mdash;In preparing a fruit tree for
transplantation, the first thing to be done is to open a trench
round it at a distance of from 3 to 4 ft., according to size. The
trench should be opened to about two spades&rsquo; depth, and any
coarse roots which may extend thus far from the trunk may be
cut clean off with a sharp knife. The soil between the trench
and the stem is to be reduced as far as may seem necessary or
practicable by means of a digging fork, the roots as soon as they
are liberated being fixed on one side and carefully preserved.
By working in this way all round the ball, the best roots will be
got out and preserved, and the ball lightened of all superfluous
soil. The tree will then be ready to lift if carefully prized up from
beneath the ball, and if it does not lift readily, it will probably
be found that a root has struck downwards, which will have to
be sought out and cut through. Whenever practicable, it is best
to secure a ball of earth round the roots. On the tree being lifted
from its hole the roots should be examined, and all which have
been severed roughly with the spade should have the ends cut
smooth with the knife to facilitate the emission of fibres. The
tree can then be transported to its new position. The hole for its
reception should be of sufficient depth to allow the base of the
ball of earth, or of the roots, to stand so that the point whence the
uppermost roots spring from the stem may be 2 or 3 in. below
the general surface level. Then the bottom being regulated so
as to leave the soil rather highest in the centre, the plant is to
be set in the hole in the position desired, and steadied there by
hand. Next the roots from the lower portion of the ball are to
be sought out and laid outwards in lines radiating from the stem,
being distributed equally on all sides as nearly as this can be done;
some fine and suitable good earth should be thrown amongst
the roots as they are thus being placed, and worked in well
up to the base of the ball. The soil covering the roots may be
gently pressed down, but the tree should not be pulled up and
down, as is sometimes done, to settle the soil. This done,
another set of roots higher up the ball must be laid out in the
same way, and again another, until the whole of the roots, thus
carefully laid, are embedded as firmly as may be in the soil, which
may now receive another gentle treading. The stem should
next be supported permanently, either by one stake or by three,
according to its size. The excavation will now be filled up about
two-thirds perhaps; and if so the tree may have a thorough
good watering, sufficient to settle the soil closely about its roots.
After twenty-four hours the hole may be levelled in, with
moderate treading, if the water has soaked well in, the surface
being left level and not sloping upwards towards the stem of the
tree. In transplanting trees of the ornamental class, less need
be attempted in respect to providing new soil, although the soil
should be made as congenial as practicable. Generally speaking,
fruit trees are best transplanted when three or four years of age,
in which time they will have acquired the shape given by the
nurseryman, who generally transplants his stock each autumn
to produce large masses of root fibres. Nowadays, however,
quite large trees, chiefly of an ornamental character, and perhaps
weighing several tons, are lifted with a large ball of soil attached
to the roots, by means of a special tree-lifting machine, and are
readily transferred from one part of the garden to another, or
even for a distance of several miles, without serious injury.
The best season for transplanting deciduous trees is during
the early autumn months. As regards evergreens opinions are
divided, some preferring August and September, others April
or May. They can be successfully planted at either period, but
for subjects which are at all difficult to remove the spring
months are to be preferred.

In transplanting smaller subjects, such as plants for the flower
garden, much less effort is required. The plant must be lifted
with as little injury to its rootlets as possible, and carefully set
into the hole, the soil being filled in round it, and carefully
pressed close by the hand. For moving small plants the garden
trowel is a very convenient tool, but we are inclined to give the
preference to the hand-fork. For larger masses, such as strong-growing
herbaceous plants, a spade or digging-fork will be
requisite and the soil may be trodden down with the feet.

When seedlings of vigorous plants have to be &ldquo;pricked out,&rdquo;
a dibble or dibber is the best implement to be used. The ground
being prepared and, if necessary, enriched, and the surface made
fine and smooth, a hole is made with the dibble deep enough and
large enough to receive the roots of the seedling plants without
doubling them up, and the hole is filled in by working the soil close
to the plant with the point of the dibble. The pricking out of
seedlings in pots in the propagating pit is effected in a similar
way. The plants, indeed, often require to be removed and set
from ½ in. to 1 in. apart before they have become sufficiently
developed to admit of being handled with any degree of facility,
and for these a pointed stick of convenient size is used as a dibble.
In delicate cases, such as seedling gloxinias and begonias, it is
best to lift the little seedling on the end of a flattish pointed
stick, often cleft at the apex, pressing this into the new soil where
the plant is to be placed, and liberating it and closing the earth
about it by the aid of a similar stick held in the other hand.



Fig. 26.&mdash;Section of Pot showing Crocks.

Potting and Repotting.&mdash;Garden pots are made with a comparatively
large hole in the bottom, and those of the largest size
have also holes at the side near the bottom; these openings
are to prevent the soil becoming saturated
or soured with superabundant
water. To prepare the pot for the
plant, a broadish piece of potsherd,
called a &ldquo;crock,&rdquo; is placed over the
large hole, and if there be side holes
they also are covered. The bottom
crock is made from a piece of a broken
garden pot, and is laid with the convex
side upwards; then comes a layer
of irregular pieces of crock of various
sizes, about 1 in. deep in a 5-in. pot,
2 in. in an 11-in. or 12-in. pot, &amp;c. The mode of crocking a
pot is shown in fig. 26. A few of the coarser lumps from the outer
759
edge of the heap of potting soil are spread over the crocks.
The same end, that of keeping the finer particles of the soil from
mixing with the drainage crocks, may be attained by shaking
in a little clean moss. A handful or two of the soil is then put
in, and on this the plant with its roots spread out is to be set, a
trifle higher than the plant should stand in the pot when finished
off; more soil is to be added, and the whole pressed firmly with
the fingers, the base of the stem being just below the pot-rim,
and the surface being smoothed off so as to slope a little outwards.
When finished off, the pots should be watered well, to settle the
soil; but they should stand till the water has well drained away,
since, if they are moved about while the fresh soil is very wet,
there will be a risk of its becoming puddled or too much consolidated.
Larger plants do not need quite such delicate treatment,
but care should be taken not to handle the roots roughly.
The soil for these may be somewhat coarser, and the amount of
drainage material more ample. Larger bodies of soil also require
to be more thoroughly consolidated before watering; otherwise
they would settle down so as to leave an unsightly void at the
pot-rim.

Some plants, especially when potted temporarily, may be
dealt with in a simpler way. A single crock may be used in some
cases, and in others no crock at all, but a handful of half-decayed
leaves or half-decayed dung thrown into the bottom of the pot.
This mode of potting does well for bulbs, such as hyacinths,
which are either thrown away or planted out when the bloom
is over. The bedding plants generally may be potted in this way,
the advantage being that at planting-out time there is less risk
of disturbing the roots than if there were potsherds to remove.
Plants of this character should be potted a little less firmly than
specimens which are likely to stand long in the pot, and indeed the
soil should be made comparatively light by the intermixture
of leaf-mould or some equivalent, in order that the roots may run
freely and quickly into it.

For epiphytal plants like orchids the most thorough drainage
must be secured by the abundant use of potsherds, small pots
being sometimes inserted inside the larger ones, or by planting
in shallow pots or pans, so that there shall be no large mass of soil
to get consolidated. For most of these the lightest spongy but
sweet turfy peat must be used, this being packed lightly about
the roots, and built up above the pot-rim, or in some cases freely
mixed before use with chopped sphagnum moss and small pieces
of broken pots or nodules of charcoal. The plants under these
conditions often require to be supported by wooden pegs or sticks.
Some of the species grow better when altogether taken out of
the soil and fixed to blocks of wood, but in this case they require
a little coaxing with moss about the roots until they get established.
In other cases they are planted in open baskets of wood
or wire, using the porous peat and sphagnum compost. Both
blocks and baskets are usually suspended from the roof of the
house, hanging free, so that no accumulation of water is possible.
These conditions of orchid-growing have undergone great changes
of late years, and the plants are grown much as other stove and
greenhouse plants in ordinary pots with composts not only of peat
but of leaf-mould, and fibres from osmunda and polypodium
ferns.

When repotting is adopted as a temporary expedient, as in
the case of bedding-out plants which it is required to push forward
as much as possible, it will suffice if provision is made to
prevent the drainage hole from getting blocked, and a rich light
compost is provided for the encouragement of the roots. When,
however, a hard-wooded plant has to be repotted, the case is
different; it may stand without further potting for one year
or two years or more, and therefore much more care is necessary.
The old ball of earth must be freed from all or most of the old
crocks without doing injury to the roots, and the sharp edge of
the upper surface gently rubbed off. If there be any sour or
sodden or effete soil into which the roots have not run, this
should be carefully picked out with a pointed stick. The ball
is to be set on the new soil just high enough that when finished
the base of the stem may be somewhat below the pot-rim, and
the space between the old ball and the sides of the pot is to
be filled in gradually with the prepared compost, which is from
time to time to be pressed down with a blunt-ended flat piece
of wood called a potting-stick, so as to render the new soil as
solid as the old. The object of this is to prevent the plant from
starving by the water applied all running off by way of the new
soil, and not penetrating the original ball of earth. When this
amount of pressure is necessary, especially in the case of loamy
composts, the soil itself should be rather inclined to dryness, and
should in no case be sufficiently moist to knead together into a
pasty mass. In ordinary cases the potting soil should be just so
far removed from dryness that when a handful is gently pressed
it may hang together, but may lose its cohesion when dropped.

When plants are required to stand in ornamental china pots
or vases, it is better, both for the plants and for avoiding risk
of breakage, to grow them in ordinary garden pots of a size that
will drop into the more valuable vessels. Slate pots or tubs,
usually square, are sometimes adopted, and are durable and
otherwise unobjectionable, only, their sides being less porous, the
earth does not dry so rapidly, and some modification of treatment
as to watering is necessary. For large conservatory specimens
wooden tubs, round or square, are frequently used; these should
be coated with pitch inside to render them more durable.

Various other contrivances take the place of garden pots for
special purposes. Thus shallow square or oblong wooden
boxes, made of light, inexpensive wood, are very useful for seed-sowing,
for pricking out seedlings, or for planting cuttings.
When the disturbance of the roots incidental to all transplanting
is sought to be avoided, the seed or plant is started in some
cases in squares of turf (used grassy-side downwards), which can
when ready be transferred to the place the plant is to occupy.
Cucumber and melon plants and vines reared from eyes are sometimes
started in this way, both for the reason above mentioned
and because it prevents the curling of the roots apt to take
place in plants raised in pots. Strips of turf are sometimes used
for the rearing of early peas, which are sown in a warmish house
or frame, and gradually hardened so as to bear exposure before
removal to the open air.

Watering.&mdash;The guiding principle in watering plants is to do
it thoroughly when it is required, and to abstain from giving
a second supply till the first has been taken up.

When watering becomes necessary for kitchen-garden crops,
the hose should be laid on and the lines of esculents allowed to
drink their fill, if fresh succulent vegetables are desired. So also,
if well-swelled and luscious fruits, such as strawberries, are
required, there must be no parching at the roots. This applies
even more strongly to conservatory borders and to forcing-houses
than to the outside fruit-tree borders, because from these
the natural rain supply is in most cases more distinctly cut off.
In the case of forcing-houses, the water should be heated before
being applied to the borders containing the roots of the trees.

In the watering of pot plants the utmost care is requisite if
the plant be a shy-growing or valuable one, and yet it is almost
impossible to give any intelligible instruction for performing
the operation. The roots should never be suffered either to get
thoroughly dry or to get sodden with excess of water. An adept
will know by the ring of the pot on striking it with his knuckles
whether water is wanted or not, according as it rings loud and
clear or dull and heavy. With very choice subjects watering
may be necessary two or three times a day in drying summer
weather. It is a wrong though common practice to press the
surface of the soil in the pot in order to feel if it is moist enough,
as this soon consolidates it, and prevents it from getting the full
benefit of aeration.

In all heated houses the water used should be warmed at
least up to the temperature of the atmosphere, so as to avoid
chilling the roots. This is also necessary in the case of water
used for syringing the plants, which should be done two or three
times a day in all stoves and forcing-houses, especially during
the period when the young growth is being developed. The
damping of all absorbent surfaces, such as the floors or bare
walls, &amp;c., is frequently necessary several times a day in the
growing season, so as to keep up a humid atmosphere; hence
760
the advantage of laying the floors a little rounded, as then the
water draws off to the sides against the kerbstone, while the
centre remains dry for promenaders.

In cooler structures it becomes necessary in the dull season
of the year to prevent the slopping of water over the plants
or on the floor, as this tends to cause &ldquo;damping off,&rdquo;&mdash;the
stems assuming a state of mildewy decay, which not infrequently,
if it once attacks a plant, will destroy it piece by piece. For
the same reason cleanliness and free ventilation under favourable
weather conditions are of great importance.

Pruning.&mdash;Pruning is a very important operation in the
fruit garden, its object being twofold&mdash;(1) to give form to the
tree, and (2) to induce the free production of flower buds as the
precursors of a plentiful crop of fruit. To form a standard tree,
either the stock is allowed to grow up with a straight stem, by
cutting away all side branches up to the height required, say
about 6 ft., the scion or bud being worked at that point, and
the head developed therefrom; or the stock is worked close
to the ground, and the young shoot obtained therefrom is allowed
to grow up in the same way, being pruned in its progress to
keep it single and straight, and the top being cut off when the
desired height is reached, so as to cause the growth of lateral
shoots. If these are three or four in number, and fairly balanced
as to strength and position, little pruning will be required.
The tips of unripened wood should be cut back about one-third
their length at an outwardly placed bud, and the chief pruning
thereafter required will be to cut away inwardly directed shoots
which cross or crowd each other and tend to confuse the centre
of the tree. Bushy heads should be thinned out, and those
that are too large cut back so as to remodel them. If the shoots
produced are not sufficient in number, or are badly placed, or
very unequal in vigour, the head should be cut back moderately
close, leaving a few inches only of the young shoots, which should
be pruned back to buds so placed as to furnish shoots in the
positions desired. When worked at the top of a stem formed
of the stock, the growth from the graft or bud must be pruned
in a similar way. Three or four leading shoots should be selected
to pass ere long into boughs and form a well-balanced framework
for the tree; these boughs, however, will soon grow beyond
any artificial system the pruner may adopt.



Fig. 27.&mdash;Dwarf-Tree Pruning.

To form a dwarf or bush fruit tree the stock must be worked
near the ground, and the young shoot produced from the scion
or bud must be cut back to whatever height it is desired the
dwarf stem should be, say 1½ to 2 ft. The young shoots produced
from the portion of the new wood retained are to form the
framework of the bush tree, and must be dealt with as in the
case of standard trees. The growth of inwardly directed shoots
is to be prevented, and the centre kept open, the tree assuming
a cup-shaped outline. Fig. 27, reduced from M. Hardy&rsquo;s
excellent work, Traité de la taille des arbres fruitiers, will give
a good idea how these dwarf trees are to be manipulated, a
showing the first year&rsquo;s development from the maiden tree after
being headed back, and b the form assumed a year or two later.



Fig. 28.&mdash;Pyramid Pruning.

In forming a pyramidal tree, the lateral growths, instead of
being removed, as in the standard tree, are encouraged to
the utmost; and in order to strengthen them the upper part
of the leading shoot is removed annually, the side branches
being also shortened somewhat as the tree advances in size.
In fig. 28, reduced from M. Hardy&rsquo;s work, a shows a young
tree with its second year&rsquo;s growth, the upright shoot of the maiden
tree having been moderately headed back, being left longer
if the buds near the base promise to break freely, or cut shorter
if they are weak and wanting in vigour. The winter pruning,
carried out with the view to shape the tree into a well-grown
pyramid, would be effected at the places marked by a cross line.
The lowest branch would have four buds retained, the end one
being on the lower side of the branch. The two next would be
cut to three buds, which here also are fortunately so situated
that the one to be left is on the lower side of the branches.
The fourth is not cut at all owing to its shortness and weakness,
its terminal bud being allowed to grow to draw strength into it.
The fifth is an example where the bud to which the shoot should
be cut back is badly placed; a shoot resulting from a bud left
on the upper side is apt instead of growing outwards to grow erect,
and lead to confusion in the form of the tree; to avoid
this it is tied down in its proper place during the summer by a
small twig. The upper shoots are cut closer in. Near the base
of the stem are two prominent buds, which would produce two
vigorous shoots, but these would be too near the ground, and
the buds should therefore be suppressed; but, to strengthen
the lower part, the weaker buds just above and below the lowest
branch should be forced into growth, by making a transverse
incision close above each. Fig. 28, b, shows what a similar tree
would be at the end of the third year&rsquo;s growth.

761

In order to bring a young tree into the cordon shape, all its
side branches are shortened back, either to form permanent
spurs, as in the case of pears, or to yield annual young shoots,
as in peaches and nectarines. The single-stemmed cordon may
be trained horizontally, obliquely at any required angle, or
vertically if required, the first two arrangements being preferable.
If a double cordon is required, the original young stem must be
headed back, and the two best shoots produced must be selected,
trained right and left, and treated as for the single cordon.

The forms chiefly adopted for trees trained to walls and
espalier rails are the fan-shaped, the half-fan and the horizontal,
with their various modifications.

The maiden tree is headed down, and two shoots led away
right and left. Two laterals should be allowed to grow from
the upper side of them, one from near the base, the other from
near the middle, all others being pinched out beyond the second
or third leaf during summer, but cut away to the last bud in
winter. The tree will thus consist of six shoots, probably 3 ft.
to 4 ft. long, which are not to be pruned unless they are unequal
in strength, a defect which is rather to be remedied by summer
pinching than by winter pruning. The second year three young
shoots are to be left on each of the six, one close to the base,
one about the middle, and one at the point, the rest being rubbed
off. These three shoots will produce laterals, of which one or
two may be selected and laid in; and thus a number of moderately
strong fertile shoots will be obtained, and at the end of
the season a comparatively large tree will be the result.



Fig. 29.&mdash;Pruning for Fan-shaped Tree.
Fig. 30.&mdash;The same&mdash;third year.



Fig. 31.&mdash;The same&mdash;fourth year.

The method of pruning formerly adopted for the formation
of a fan-shaped tree was to head down the maiden plant to
about two eyes, so placed as to yield a young shoot on each
side (fig. 29), the supernumerary shoots being rubbed off while
quite young, and the reserved shoots trained against the wall
during the summer so as to get them well matured. The next
year they were cut back again; often nearly to the base, in
order that the lower pair of these shoots might each produce
two well-placed young shoots, and the upper pair three young
shoots. The tree would thus consist of ten shoots, to be laid
out at regular distances, and then if closely cut the frame-work
of the tree would be as in fig. 30. These main shoots were not
again to be shortened back, but from each of them three young
shoots were to be selected and trained in two, on the upper side,
one near the base, and the other halfway up, and one on the lower
side placed about midway between these two; these with the
leading shoot, which was also to be nailed in, made four branches
of the current year from each of the ten main branches, and
the form of the tree would therefore be that of fig. 31. The
other young shoots
produced were
pinched off while
quite young, to throw
all the strength of
the tree into those
which were to form
its basis, and to secure
abundant light and
air. In after years
the leading shoot was
not to be cut back, but
all the lateral shoots
were to be shortened, and from these year by year other shoots
were to be selected to fill up the area occupied by the tree.



Fig. 32.&mdash;Pruning forHorizontally trained Tree.
Fig. 33.&mdash;The same&mdash;third year.



Fig. 34.&mdash;The same&mdash;fifth year.

In pruning for a horizontal tree the young maiden tree has
to be headed back nearly to its base, and from the young shoots
three are to be selected, the two best-placed lower ones to form
an opposite or nearly opposite pair of main branches, and the
best-placed upper one to continue the erect stem (fig. 32). This
upper shoot is at the next winter pruning to be cut down to
within about a foot of the point whence it sprung, and its buds
rubbed off except the upper one for a leader, and one on each
side just below it to furnish another pair of side shoots; these
being trained in position, the tree would appear as in fig. 33.
The same course is to be followed annually till the space is filled.
Sometimes in very favourable soils and with vigorous trees
two pairs of branches may be obtained in one season by summer-stopping
the erect shoots and selecting others from the young
growths thus induced, but more commonly the trees have to
be built up by forming one pair of branches annually. The
shoots are not at first lowered to the horizontal line, but are
brought down gradually and tied to thin stakes; and while
the tree is being formed weak shoots may be allowed to grow
in a more erect position than it is ultimately intended they
should occupy. Thus in four or five years the tree will have
acquired something of the character of fig. 34, and will go on
thus increasing until the space is filled.

The half-fan is a combination of the two forms, but as regards
pruning does not materially differ from the horizontal, as two
opposite side branches are produced in succession upwards
till the space is filled, only they are not taken out so abruptly,
but are allowed to rise at an acute angle and then to curve
into the horizontal line.

In all the various forms of cordons, in horizontal training,
and in fan and half-fan training, the pruning of the main branches
when the form of the tree is worked out will vary in accordance
with the kind of fruit under treatment. Thus in the peach,
nectarine, apricot, plum and cherry, which are commonly
trained fan-fashion, the first three (and also the morello cherry
if grown) will have to be pruned so as to keep a succession of
young annual shoots, these being their fruit-bearing wood.
The others are generally pruned so as to combine a moderate
supply of young wood with a greater or less number of fruit
spurs. In the pear and apple the fruit is borne principally on
spurs, and hence what is known as spur-pruning has to be
adopted, the young shoots being all cut back nearly to their
base, so as to cause fruit buds to evolve from the remaining
eyes or buds. Cordons of apples and pears have to be similarly
treated, but cordons of peaches and nectarines are pruned so as
to provide the necessary annual succession of young bearing
wood.

762

Fruit trees trained as espaliers, fans or cordons against walls,
trellises or fences, are not only pruned carefully in the winter
but must be also pruned during the early summer months.
Many of the smaller, useless shoots are rubbed out altogether;
the best are allowed to grow perhaps a foot or more in length,
and then either have the tips pinched out with the finger and
thumb, or the ends may be cracked or broken, and allowed
to hang down, but are not detached completely. This is called
summer pruning, and is an important operation requiring
knowledge on the part of the gardener to perform properly.
Shoots of peaches, nectarines and morello cherries are &ldquo;laid
in,&rdquo; that is, placed in between fruiting shoots where there is the
space to be ripened for next year&rsquo;s crop.




Fig. 35.&mdash;Summer Pruning for Spurs.

Summer Pruning should be performed while the shoots are yet
young and succulent, so that they may in most cases be nipped
off with the thumb-nail. It is very necessary in the case of trees
trained to a flat surface, as a wall or espalier rail, to prevent
undue crowding. In some cases, as, for example, with peaches,
the superfluous shoots are wholly removed, and certain selected
shoots reserved to supply bearing wood for next year. In others,
as pears, the tops of the young shoots are
removed, leaving three or four leaves
and their buds at the base, to be developed
into fruit buds by the additional
nourishment thus
thrown into them
(fig. 35, a). One
or two may push
out a late summer
growth, b; this
will serve as a
vent for the vigour
of the tree, and
if the lowermost only go to the formation of a fruit spur, the
object will have been gained. They are cut to the last dormant
bud in winter.

But summer pruning has been much extended since the
introduction of restricted growth and the use of dwarfing stocks.
Orchard-house trees, and also pyramidal and bush trees of apples,
pears and plums, are mainly fashioned by summer pruning;
in fact, the less the knife is used upon them, except in the
necessary cutting of the roots in potted trees, the better. In
the case of orchard-house plants no shoots are suffered to lengthen
out, except as occasionally wanted to fill up a gap in the outline
of the tree. On the contrary, the tops of all young shoots are
pinched off when some three or four leaves are formed, and this
is done again and again throughout the season. When this
pruning is just brought to a balance with the vigour of the roots,
the consequence is that fruit buds are formed all over the tree,
instead of a thicket of sterile and useless wood. Pyramidal
and bush trees out of doors are, of course, suffered to become
somewhat larger, and sufficient wood must be allowed to grow
to give them the form desired; but after the first year or two,
when the framework is laid out, they are permitted to extend
very slowly, and never to any great extent, while the young
growths are continually nipped off, so as to clothe the branches
with fruit buds as closely placed as will permit of their healthy
development.

The nature of the cut itself in pruning is of more consequence,
especially in the case of fruit trees, than at first sight may appear.
The branches should be separated by a clean cut at an angle of
about 45°, just at the back of a bud, the cut entering on a level
with the base of the bud and passing out on a level with its
top (fig. 36, a), for when cut in this way the wound becomes
rapidly covered with new wood, as soon as growth recommences,
whereas if the cut is too close the bud is starved, or if less close an
ugly and awkward snag is left. Fig 36, b and c, are examples of
the former, and d, e, f of the latter. In fact there is only one
right way to cut a shoot and that is as shown at a.



Fig. 36.&mdash;Cuts&mdash;Good and Bad.

The Pruning of flowering plants is generally a much lighter
matter than the pruning of fruit trees. If a young seedling
or cutting of any soft-wooded plant is to be bushy, it must have
its top nipped out by the thumb-nail or pruning-scissors at a
very early stage, and this stopping must be repeated frequently.
If what is called a well-furnished plant is required, an average
of from 2 to 3 in. is all the extension that must be permitted&mdash;sometimes
scarcely so much&mdash;before the top is nipped out; and
this must be continued until the desired size is attained, whether
that be large or small. Then generally the plant is allowed to
grow away till bloom or blooming shoots are developed. To
form a pyramidal plant, which is a very elegant and useful
shape to give to a decorative pot plant, the main stem should
be encouraged to grow upright, for a length perhaps of 6 or 8 in.
before it is topped; this induces the formation of laterals, and
favours their development. The best-placed upper young shoot
is selected and trained upright to a slender stake, and this also
is topped when it has advanced 6 or 8 in. further, in order to
induce the laterals on the second portion to push freely. This
process is continued till the required size is gained. With all the
difficult and slow-growing plants of the hard-wooded section, all
the pruning must be done in this gradual way in the young wood
as the plant progresses.



Fig. 37.

Some plants, like pelargoniums, can only be kept handsomely
formed and well furnished by cutting them down severely every
season, after the blooming is over. The plants should be prepared
for this by keeping them rather dry at the root, and after cutting
they must stand with little or no water till the stems heal over,
and produce young shoots, or &ldquo;break,&rdquo; as it is technically termed.
The appearance of a specimen pelargonium properly pruned is
shown in fig. 37, in which a shows a young plant, the head of
which has been
taken off to form
a cutting, and
whose buds are
ready to break
into young
shoots. Three
shoots will be
produced, and
these, after
growing from 4
to 6 in. in length,
should be stopped by pinching out the point, this giving rise to
lateral shoots. These will blossom in due course, and, after being
ripened thoroughly by full exposure to the sun, should be cut
back as shown at b. This is the proper foundation for a good
specimen, and illustrates how all such subjects should be pruned
to keep them stocky and presentable in form.

Root-pruning is most commonly practised in fruit-tree cultivation.
It is often resorted to as a means of restoring fertility in
plants which have become over rank from an excess of nourishment
in the soil, or sterile from want of it. The effect of root-pruning
in the first case is to reduce the supply of crude sap to the
branches, and consequently to cause a check in their development.
In the second case all roots that have struck downwards
into a cold uncongenial subsoil must be pruned off if they cannot
be turned in a lateral direction, and all the lateral ones that
have become coarse and fibreless must also be shortened back by
means of a clean cut with a sharp knife, while a compost of rich
loamy soil with a little bone-meal, and leaf-mould or old manure,
should be filled into the trenches from which the old sterile
soil has been taken. The operation is best performed early in
autumn, and may be safely resorted to in the case of fruit trees
763
of moderate age, and even of old trees if due care be exercised.
In transplanting trees all the roots which may have become
bruised or broken in the process of lifting should be cut clean
away behind the broken part, as they then more readily strike
out new roots from the cut parts. In all these cases the cut
should be a clean sloping one, and made in an upward and outward
direction.

The root-pruning of pot-plants is necessary in the case of many
soft-wooded subjects which are grown on year after year&mdash;pelargoniums
and fuchsias, for example. After the close pruning
of the branches to which they are annually subjected, and when
the young shoots have shot forth an inch or two in length, they are
turned out of their pots and have the old soil shaken away from
their roots, the longest of which, to the extent of about half the
existing quantity, are then cut clean away, and the plants
repotted into small pots. This permits the growing plant to be
fed with rich fresh soil, without having been necessarily transferred
to pots of unwieldy size by the time the flowering stage
is reached.

Ringing.&mdash;One of the expedients for inducing a state of fruitfulness
in trees is the ringing of the branches or stem, that is,
removing a narrow annular portion of the bark, by which means,
it is said, the trees are not only rendered productive, but the
quality of the fruit is at the same time improved. The advantage
depends on the obstruction given to the descent of the sap.
The ring should be cut out in spring, and be of such a width that
the bark may remain separated for the season. A tight ligature
of twine or wire answers the same end. The advantages of the
operation may generally be gained by judicious root pruning,
and it is not at all adapted for the various stone fruits.



Fig. 38.&mdash;Diagram illustrating Branch
Distribution.

Training.&mdash;What is called training is the guiding of the
branches of a tree or plant in certain positions which they would
not naturally assume, the object being partly to secure their
full exposure to light, and partly to regulate the flow and distribution
of the sap. To secure the former object, the branches
must be so fixed as to shade each other as little as possible; and
to realize the
second, the
branches must
have given to
them an upward
or downward
direction, as they
may require to
be encouraged
or repressed.
Something of the
same vegetative
vigour which is
given to a plant
or tree by hard
pruning is afforded by training in an upward direction so as
to promote the flow of the sap; while the repression effected
by summer pruning is supplemented by downward training,
which acts as a check. One main object is the preservation
of equilibrium in the growth of the several parts of the tree;
and for this various minor details deserve attention. Thus
a shoot will grow more vigorously whilst waving in the air
than when nailed close to the wall; consequently a weak
shoot should be left free, whilst its stronger antagonist should
be restrained; and a luxuriant shoot may be retarded for
some time by having its tender extremity pinched off to allow
a weaker shoot to overtake it.

By the prudent use of the knife, fruit trees may be readily
trained into the forms indicated below, which are amongst the
best out of the many which have been devised.



Fig. 39.&mdash;Pyramidal Training.
Fig. 40.&mdash;Training en quenouille.

The training of standard and bush trees in the open ground has
been already referred to under the section Pruning. When the
growth of pyramids is completed, the outline is something like
that of fig. 39, and very pretty trees are thus formed. It is
better, however, especially if the tendency to bear fruit is rather
slack, to adopt what the French call en quenouille training
(fig. 40), which consists in tying or weighting the tips of the
branches so as to give them all a downward curve. Pear trees
worked on the quince stock, and trained en quenouille, are
generally very fertile.

Wall trees, it must be evident, are placed in a very unnatural
and constrained position, and would in fact soon be reduced to a
state of utter confusion if allowed to grow unrestricted; hence
the following modes of training have been adopted.



Fig. 41.&mdash;Horizontal Training.



Fig. 42.&mdash;Forms of Horizontal Training.

Horizontal Training (fig. 41) has long been a favourite form in
England. There is one principal ascending stem, from which
the branches depart at right angles, at intervals of about a foot.
Horizontal training is best adapted to the apple and the pear;
and for the more twiggy growing slender varieties, the forms
shown in fig. 42 have been recommended. In these the horizontal
branches are placed wider, 18 to 20 in. apart, and the smaller
shoots are trained between them, either on both sides, as at a,
or deflexed from the lower side, as at b. The latter is an excellent
method of reclaiming neglected trees. Every alternate
branch should be taken away, and the spurs cut off, after which
the young shoots are trained in, and soon produce good fruit.




Fig. 43.&mdash;Fan Training.



Fig. 44.&mdash;Modified Fan Training.

In Fan Training (fig. 43) there is no leading stem, but the
branches spring from the base and are arranged somewhat like
the ribs of a fan. This mode of training is commonly adopted
for the peach, nectarine, apricot and morello cherry, to which
764
it is best adapted. Though sometimes adopted, it is not so
well suited as the horizontal form for apples and pears, because,
when the branches reach the top of the wall, where they must
be cut short, a hedge of young shoots is inevitable. A modification
of the fan shape (fig. 44) is sometimes adopted for stone
fruits, such as the plum and apricot. In this the object is to
establish a number of mother branches, and on these to form a
series of subordinate members, chiefly composed of bearing wood.
The mother branches or limbs should not be numerous, but
well marked, equal in strength and regularly disposed. The
side branches should be pretty abundant, short and not so
vigorous as to rival the leading members.

The Half-fan mode of training, which is intermediate between
horizontal and fan training, is most nearly allied to the former,
but the branches leave the stem at an acute angle, a disposition
supposed to favour the more equal distribution of the sap. Sometimes,
as in fig. 45, two vertical stems are adopted, but there is no
particular advantage in this, and a single-stemmed tree is more
manageable. The half-fan form is well adapted for such fruits
as the plum and the cherry; and, indeed, for fruits of vigorous
habit, it seems to combine the advantages of both the foregoing.



Fig. 45.&mdash;Half-Fan Training.

Trees must be fixed to the walls and buildings against which
they are trained by means of nails and shreds (neat medicated
strips are now sold for this purpose), or in cases where it is
desired to preserve the wall surface intact, by permanent nails
or studs driven in in regular order. Sometimes the walls are
furnished with galvanized wires, but this has been objected to
as causing cankering of the shoots, for which, however, painting
is recommended as a remedy. By crossing the tying material
between the wire and the wood, however, and so preventing
them from coming in contact, there is no danger. If they are
adopted, the wires should be a few inches away from the wall, to
allow free circulation of air between it and the tree, and thus
avoid the scorching or burning of leaves and fruits during the
summer months in very hot places. Care should be taken that
the ties or fastenings do not eventually cut into the bark as the
branches swell with increased age. When shreds and nails are
used, short thick wire nails and &ldquo;medicated shreds&rdquo; are the
best; the ordinary cast iron wall nails being much too brittle
and difficult to drive into the wall. It must be remembered that
nails spoil a wall sooner or later, whereas a wire trellis is not only
much neater, but enables the gardener to tie his trees up much
more quickly.

For tying plants to trellises and stakes soft tarred string or
raffia (the fibre from the Raphia palm of Madagascar) is used.



Fig. 46.&mdash;Clematis trained on Balloon-Shaped Trellis.

In training greenhouse plants the young branches should be
drawn outwards by means of ties fastened to a string or wire
under the pot-rim; the centre then fills up, and slender stakes
are used as required; but the fewer these are in number the
better. Climbers are trained from the bottom around or across
trellises, of which the cylindrical or the balloon-shaped, or
sometimes the flat oval or circular, are the best forms. The size
should be adapted to the habit of the plant, which should cover
the whole by the time flowers are produced. Bast fibre and
raffia fibre are to be preferred for light subjects of this character,
as they can be split to any degree of fineness. Very durable
trellises for greenhouse climbers are made of slender round iron
rods for standards, having a series of hooks on the inner edge,
into which rings of similar metal are dropped; the rings may be
graduated so as to form a broad open top, or may be all of the
same size, when the trellis will assume the cylindrical form.
Fig. 46 shows a pot specimen of clematis trained, over a
balloon-shaped
trellis.

The training of certain bedding plants over the surface of
the soil is done by small pegs of birch wood or bracken, by
loops of wire or cheap hair-pins, or sometimes by loops of raffia
having the ends fixed in the soil by the aid of the dibble. The
object is to fill up the blank space as quickly and as evenly as
possible.

Forcing is the accelerating, by special treatment, of the growth
of certain plants, which are required to be had in leaf, in flower
or in fruit before their natural season,&mdash;as, for instance, the leaves
of mint at Eastertide or the leafstalks of sea-kale and rhubarb
765
at Christmas, the flowers of summer in the depth of winter, or
some of the choicest fruits perfected so much before their normal
period as to complete, with the retarded crops of winter, the circle
of the seasons.

In the management of artificial heat for this purpose, a
considerable degree of caution is required. The first stages
of forcing should, of course, be very gentle, so that the whole
growth of the plants may advance in harmony. The immediate
application of a very hot atmosphere would unduly force the
tops, while the roots remained partially or wholly inactive; and
a strong bottom heat, if it did not cause injury by its excess, would
probably result in abortive growth.

Any sudden decrease of warmth would be very prejudicial
to the progress of vegetation through the successive stages of
foliation, inflorescence and fructification. But it is not necessary
that one unvarying range of temperature should be kept up at
whatever pains or risk. Indeed, in very severe weather it is
found better to drop a little from the maximum temperature by
fire heat, and the loss so occasioned may be made good by a little
extra heat applied when the weather is more genial. Night
temperatures also should always be allowed to drop somewhat,
the heat being increased again in the morning. In other words,
the artificial temperature should increase by day and decrease
by night, should rise in summer and fall in winter, should, in
short, imitate as nearly as possible the varying influence of the
sun.

For the growth of flowers generally, and for that of all fruits,
every ray of light to be obtained in the dull winter season is
required, and therefore every possible care should be taken to
keep the glass clean. A moist genial atmosphere too is essential,
a point requiring unremitting attention on account of the
necessity of keeping up strong fires. With moisture as with heat,
the cultivator must hold his hand somewhat in very severe or
very dull weather; but while heat must not drop so as to chill
the progressing vegetation, so neither must the lack of moisture
parch the plants so as to check their growth.

There are some few subjects which when forced do not require
a light house. Thus amongst flowers the white blossoms of the
lilac, so much prized during winter, are produced by forcing
purple-flowered plants in darkness. Rhubarb and sea-kale among
esculents both need to be forced in darkness to keep them crisp
and tender, and mushrooms also are always grown in dark
structures. In fact, a roomy mushroom house is one of the most
convenient of all places for forcing the vegetables just referred
to. The lilac would be better placed in a dark shed heated to
about 70° or 80°, in which some dung and leaves could be
allowed to lie and ferment, giving off both a genial heat
and moisture.

One of the most important preliminaries to successful forcing
is the securing to the plants a previous state of rest. The
thorough ripening of the preceding season&rsquo;s wood in fruit trees
and flowering plants, and of the crown in perennial herbs like
strawberries, and the cessation of all active growth before the
time they are to start into a new growth, are of paramount importance.
The ripening process must be brought about by free
exposure to light, and by the application of a little extra heat with
dryness, if the season should be unfavourable; and both roots
and tops must submit to a limitation of their water supply.
When the ripening is perfected, the resting process must be
aided by keeping the temperature in which they await the forcing
process as low as each particular subject can bear. (See Retardation
above.)

V. Flowers.

Flower Garden and Pleasure Grounds.&mdash;Wherever there is a
flower garden of considerable magnitude, and in a separate
situation, it should be constructed on principles of its own.
The great object must be to exhibit to advantage the graceful
forms and glorious hues of flowering plants and shrubs. Two
varieties of flower gardens have chiefly prevailed in Britain.
In one the ground is turf, out of which flower-beds, of varied
patterns, are cut; in the other the flower-beds are separated
by gravel walks, without the introduction of grass. When
the flower garden is to be seen from the windows, or any other
elevated point of view, the former is to be preferred; but where
the surface is irregular, and the situation more remote, and
especially where the beauty of flowers is mainly looked to, the
choice should probably fall on the latter.

The flower garden may include several different compartments.
Thus, for example, there is the &ldquo;Rock Garden,&rdquo; which should
consist of variously grouped masses of large stones, those which
are remarkable for being figured by water-wearing, or containing
petrifactions or impressions, or showing something of natural
stratification, being generally preferred. In the cavities between
the stones, filled with earth, alpine or trailing plants are inserted,
and also some of the choicest flowers. In proper situations, a
small pool of water may be introduced for the culture of aquatic
plants. In these days the rock-garden is a most important
feature, and it requires a good deal of care and skill to arrange
the boulders, walks, pools or streams in natural and artistic
fashion. The selection of suitable alpines, perennials and
shrubs and trees also necessitates considerable knowledge
on the part of the gardener. A separate compartment laid out
on some regular plan is often set apart for roses, under the name
of the &ldquo;Rosery.&rdquo; A moist or rather a shady border, or a section
of the pleasure ground supplied with bog earth, may be devoted
to what is called the &ldquo;American Garden,&rdquo; which, as it includes
the gorgeous rhododendrons and azaleas, forms one of the
grandest features of the establishment during the early summer,
while if properly selected the plants are effective as a garden
of evergreens at all seasons. The number of variegated and
various-coloured hardy shrubs is now so great that a most
pleasant plot for a &ldquo;Winter Garden&rdquo; may be arrayed with plants
of this class, with which may be associated hardy subjects which
flower during that season or very early spring, as the Christmas
rose, and amongst bulbs the crocus and snowdrop. Later the
spring garden department is a scene of great attraction; and
some of the gardens of this character, as those of Cliveden and
Belvoir, are among the most fascinating examples of horticultural
art. The old-fashioned stereotyped flower garden
that one met with almost everywhere is rapidly becoming a
thing of the past, and grounds are now laid out more in accordance
with their natural disposition, their climatic conditions
and their suitability for certain kinds of plants. Besides the
features already mentioned there are now bamboo gardens,
Japanese gardens, water gardens and wall gardens, each
placed in the most suitable position and displaying its own
special features.



Fig. 47.&mdash;Turf-Beater.

Lawns.&mdash;In the formation of lawns the ground must be
regularly broken up so that it may settle down evenly, any deep
excavations that may have to be filled in being very carefully
rammed down to prevent subsequent settlement. The ground
must also be thoroughly cleared of the roots of all coarse, perennial
weeds, and be worked to a fine
tilth ready for turfing or sowing.
The more expeditious
method is of course to lay
down turf, which should be free
from weeds, and is cut usually
in strips of 1 ft. wide, 3 ft. long,
and about 1 in. in thickness.
This must be laid very evenly
and compactly, and should then
be beaten down firmly with the
implement called a turf-beater
(fig. 47). When there is a large
space to cover, it is much the
cheaper plan to sow the lawn
with grass-seeds, and equally effective, though the sward takes
much longer to thicken. It is of the utmost importance that
a good selection of grasses be made, and that pure seeds
should be obtained (see Grass and Grassland). The following
sorts can be recommended, the quantities given being those
for sowing an acre of ground:&mdash;

766


Cynosurus cristatus&mdash;Crested Dog&rsquo;s-tail 6 &#8468;
Festuca duriuscula&mdash;Hard Fescue 3 &#8468;
Festuca ovina&mdash;Sheep&rsquo;s Fescue 3 &#8468;
Lolium perenne tenue 18 &#8468;
Poa nemoralis sempervirens&mdash;Evergreen Meadow-grass 3 &#8468;
Poa trivialis&mdash;Trivial Meadow-grass 3 &#8468;
Trisetum flavescens&mdash;Yellow Oat-grass 2 &#8468;
Trifolium repens&mdash;Dutch Clover 6 &#8468;


The seeds should be thoroughly mixed, and very evenly sown,
after which the surface should be raked over to bury them, and
then rolled down while dry so as to finish it off smooth and level.
When thus sown, lawns require to be promptly weeded. During
the growing season established lawns should be mown at least
once a week. They should be occasionally rolled, and towards
autumn they require frequent sweepings to remove worm-casts.


Hardy Annuals.&mdash;Annual plants are those which grow up
from seed, flower, ripen seed, and die in the course of one season&mdash;one
year. They are useful in the mixed garden, for though in some
cases they are of short duration, many of them are possessed of much
beauty of hue and elegance of form. Annuals may be divided into
three classes: the hardy, which are sown at once in the ground
they are to occupy; the half-hardy, which succeed best when aided
at first by a slight hot bed, and then transplanted into the open air;
and the tender, which are kept in pots, and treated as greenhouse
or stove plants, to which departments they properly belong. Some
of the more popular annuals, hardy and half-hardy, have been very
much varied as regards habit and the colour of the flowers, and
purchases may be made in the seed shops of such things as China
asters, stocks, Chinese and Indian pinks, larkspurs, phloxes and
others, amongst which some of the most beautiful of the summer
flowers may be found.

The hardy annuals may be sown in the open ground during
the latter part of March or beginning of April, as the season may
determine, for the weather should be dry and open, and the soil in
a free-working condition before sowing is attempted. In favourable
situations and seasons some of the very hardiest, as Silene pendula,
Saponaria, Nemophila, Gilia, &amp;c., may be sown in September or
October, and transplanted to the beds or borders for very early spring
flowering. Those sown in spring begin to flower about June. The
plants, if left to flower where they are sown, should be thinned out
while young, to give them space for proper development. It is
from having ample room that pricked out transplanted seedlings
often make the finest plants. The soil should be rich and light.

The half-hardy series are best sown in pots or pans under glass in
mild heat, in order to accelerate germination. Those of them which
are in danger of becoming leggy should be speedily removed to a
cooler frame and placed near the glass, the young plants being
pricked off into fresh soil, in other pots or pans or boxes, as may
seem best in each case. All the plants must be hardened off gradually
during the month of April, and may generally be planted out some
time in May, earlier or later according to the season.

The class of tender annuals, being chiefly grown for greenhouse
decoration, should be treated much the same as soft-wooded plants,
being sown in spring, and grown on rapidly in brisk heat, near the
glass, and finally hardened off to stand in the greenhouse when in
flower.

Hardy Biennials.&mdash;Biennials live through one winter period.
They require to be sown in the summer months, about June or July,
in order to get established before winter; they should be pricked out
as soon as large enough, and should have ample space so as to become
hardy and stocky. They should be planted in good soil, but not of
too stimulating a character. Those that are perfectly hardy are best
planted where they are to flower in good time during autumn.
This transplanting acts as a kind of check, which is rather beneficial
than otherwise. Of those that are liable to suffer injury in winter,
as the Brompton and Queen Stocks, a portion should be potted and
wintered in cold frames ventilated as freely as the weather will
permit.

The number of biennials is not large, but a few very desirable
garden plants, such as the following, occur amongst them:&mdash;

Hardy Herbaceous Perennials.&mdash;This term includes not only
those fibrous-rooted plants of herbaceous habit which spring up from
the root year after year, but also those old-fashioned subjects known
as florists&rsquo; flowers, and the hardy bulbs. Some of the most beautiful
of hardy flowering plants belong to this class. When the length of
the flowering season is considered, it will be obvious that it is impossible
to keep up the show of a single border or plot for six months
together, since plants, as they are commonly arranged, come dropping
into and out of flower one after another; and even where a certain
number are in bloom at the same time, they necessarily stand apart,
and so the effects of contrast, which can be perceived only among
adjacent objects, are lost. To obviate this defect, it has been recommended
that ornamental plants should be formed into four or five
separate suites of flowering, to be distributed over the garden.
Not to mention the more vernal flowers, the first might contain the
flora of May; the second that of June; the third that of July; and
the fourth that of August and the following months. These compartments
should be so intermingled that no particular class may be
entirely absent from any one quarter of the garden.

Before beginning to plant, it would be well to construct tables or
lists of the plants, specifying their respective times of flowering,
colours and heights. To diversify properly and mingle well together
the reds, whites, purples, yellows and blues, with all their intervening
shades, requires considerable taste and powers of combination;
and ascertained failures may be rectified at the proper time the next
season. The one great object aimed at should be to present an
agreeable contrast&mdash;a floral picture; and, as at particular seasons a
monotony of tint prevails, it is useful at such times to be in possession
of some strong glaring colours. White, for instance, should be much
employed in July, to break the duller blues and purples which then
preponderate. Orange, too, is very effective at this season. On the
other hand, yellows are superabundant in autumn, and therefore reds
and blues should then be sought for. The flower-gardener should
have a small nursery, or reserve garden, for the propagation of the
finer plants, to be transferred into the borders as often as is required.

As a rule, all the fibrous-rooted herbaceous plants flourish in good
soil which has been fairly enriched with manure, that of a loamy
character being the most suitable. Many of them also grow satisfactorily
in a peaty soil if well worked, especially if they have a cool
moist subsoil. Pentstemons and phloxes, amongst others, succeed well
in soil of this character, but the surface must be well drained; the former
are rather apt to perish in winter in loamy soil, if at all close and heavy.
The herbaceous border should be a distinct compartment varying
from 6 to 10 ft. in width, and perhaps backed up by evergreens under
certain conditions. Such a border will take in about four lines of
plants, the tallest being placed in groups at the back and in the centre,
and the others graduated in height down to the front. In the front
row patches of the white arabis, the yellow alyssum, white, yellow,
blue, or purple violas, and the purple aubrietia, recurring at intervals
of 5 or 6 yards on a border of considerable length, carry the eye
forwards and give a balanced kind of finish to the whole. The same
might be done with dianthuses or the larger narcissi in the second
row, with paeonies, columbines and phloxes in the third, and with
delphiniums, aconitums and some of the taller yellow composites as
helianthus and rudbeckia at the back. Spring and autumn flowers,
as well as those blooming in summer, should be regularly distributed
throughout the border, which will then at no season be devoid of
interest in any part. Many of the little alpines may be brought into
768
the front line planted between suitable pieces of stone, or they
may be relegated to a particular spot, and placed on an artificial
rockery. Most of the hardy bulbs will do well enough in the border,
care being taken not to disturb them while leafless and dormant.

Some deep-rooting perennials do not spread much at the surface,
and only require refreshing from time to time by top-dressings.
Others, as the asters, spread rapidly; those possessing this habit
should be taken up every second or third year, and, a nice patch being
selected for replanting from the outer portions, the rest may be either
thrown aside, or reserved for increase; the portion selected for
replanting should be returned to its place, the ground having meanwhile
been well broken up. Some plants are apt to decay at the base,
frequently from exposure caused by the lifting process going on
during their growth; these should be taken up annually in early
autumn, the soil refreshed, and the plants returned to their places,
care being taken to plant them sufficiently deep.

Only a section of some of the best of the decorative hardy perennials
can be noted, before we pass on to those popular subjects of
this class which have been directly influenced by the hybridizer and
improver. Many more might be added to the subjoined list:&mdash;

peltatum, the North American mandrake, has large umbrella-like
leaves and white flowers; P. pleianthum, from China, purple. They
all require moist, peaty soil in warm, sheltered nooks.

Polemonium.&mdash;Pretty border flowers. P. coeruleum (Jacob&rsquo;s
Ladder), 2 ft., has elegant pinnate leaves, and long panicles of blue
rotate flowers. The variety called variegatum has very elegantly
marked leaves, and is sometimes used as a margin or otherwise in
bedding arrangements. Good garden soil.

Polygonatum.&mdash;Elegant liliaceous plants, with rhizomatous stems.
P. multiflorum (Solomon&rsquo;s Seal), 2 to 3 ft., with arching stems, and
drooping white flowers from the leaf axils, is a handsome border
plant, doing especially well in partial shade amongst shrubs, and
also well adapted for pot culture for early forcing. Good garden
soil.

Polygonum.&mdash;A large family, varying much in character, often
weedy, but of easy culture in ordinary soil. P. vacciniifolium, 6 to
10 in., is a pretty prostrate subshrubby species, with handsome
rose-pink flowers, suitable for rockwork, and prefers boggy soil;
P. affine (Brunonis), 1 ft., deep rose, is a showy border plant, flowering
in the late summer; P. cuspidatum, 8 to 10 ft., is a grand object for
planting where a screen is desired, as it suckers abundantly, and its
tall spotted stems and handsome cordate leaves have quite a noble
appearance. Other fine species are P. baldschuanium, a climber,
P. sphaerostachyum, P. lanigerum, P. polystachyum and P. sachalinense,
all bold and handsome.

Potentilla.&mdash;The double varieties are fine garden plants obtained
from P. argyrophylla atrosanguinea and P. nepalensis. The colours
include golden-yellow, red, orange-yellow, crimson, maroon and
intermediate shades. They all flourish in rich sandy soil.

Primula.&mdash;Beautiful and popular spring flowers, of which many
forms are highly esteemed in most gardens. P. vulgaris, 6 in.,
affords numerous handsome single- and double-flowered varieties,
with various-coloured flowers for the spring flower-beds and
borders. Besides this, P. Sieboldii (cortusoides amoena), 1 ft.,
originally deep rose with white eye, but now including many varieties
of colour, such as white, pink, lilac and purple; P. japonica, 1 to
2 ft., crimson-rose; P. denticulata, 1 ft., bright bluish-lilac, with
its allies P. erosa and P. purpurea, all best grown in a cold frame;
P. viscosa, 6 in., purple, and its white variety nivalis, with P. pedemontana
and P. spectabilis, 6 in., both purple; and the charming
772
little Indian P. rosea, 3 to 6 in., bright cherry-rose colour, are but a
few of the many beautiful kinds in cultivation.

Pulmonaria.&mdash;Handsome dwarf, boraginaceous plants, requiring
good deep garden soil. P. officinalis, 1 ft., has prettily mottled leaves
and blue flowers; P. sibirica is similar in character, but has broader
leaves more distinctly mottled with white.

Pyrethrum.&mdash;Composite plants of various character, but of easy
culture. P. Parthenium eximium, 2 ft., is a handsome double white
form of ornamental character for the mixed border; P. uliginosum,
5 to 6 ft., has fine large, white, radiate flowers in October; P.
Tchihatchewii, a close-growing, dense evergreen, creeping species,
with long-stalked, white flower-heads, is adapted for covering slopes
in lieu of turf, and for rockwork.

Ramondia.&mdash;R. pyrenaica, 3 to 6 in., is a pretty dwarf plant,
requiring a warm position on the rockwork and a moist, peaty soil
more or less gritty; it has rosettes of ovate spreading root-leaves,
and large purple, yellow-centred, rotate flowers, solitary, or two to
three together, on naked stalks.

Ranunculus.&mdash;The florists&rsquo; ranunculus is a cultivated form of
R. asiaticus (see Ranunculus). R. amplexicaulis, 1 ft., white;
R. aconitifolius, 1 to 2 ft., white, with its double variety R. aconitifolius
flore-pleno (Fair Maids of France); and R. acris flore-pleno
(Bachelor&rsquo;s Buttons), 2 ft., golden yellow, are pretty. Of dwarfer
interesting plants there are R. alpestris, 4 in., white; R. gramineus,
6 to 10 in., yellow; R. parnassifolius, 6 in., white; and R. rutaefolius,
4 to 6 in., white with orange centre.

Rodgersia.&mdash;Handsome herbs of the saxifrage family. R. podophylla
with large bronzy-green leaves cut into 5 large lobes, and
tall branching spikes 3 to 4 ft. high&mdash;the whole plant resembling one
of the large meadow sweets. R. aesculifolia, yellowish-white; R.
Henrici, deep purple; R. pinnata, fleshy pink; and R. sambucifolia,
white, are recently introduced species from China. They require
rich sandy peat and warm sheltered spots.

Romneya.&mdash;R. Coulteri, a fine Californian plant, with large white
flowers on shoots often as high as 7 ft.; R. trichocalyx is similar.
Both require very warm, sunny spots and rich, sandy soil, and
should not be disturbed often.

Rudbeckia.&mdash;Bold-habited composite plants, well suited for
shrubbery borders, and thriving in light loamy soil. The flower-heads
have a dark-coloured elevated disk. R. Drummondii, 2 to
3 ft., with the ray-florets reflexed, yellow at the tip and purplish-brown
towards the base; R. fulgida, 2 ft. golden-yellow with dark
chocolate disk, the flower-heads 2 to 3 in. across; and R. speciosa,
2 to 3 ft., orange-yellow with blackish-purple disk, the flower-heads
3 to 4 in. across, are showy plants.

Sagittaria.&mdash;Graceful water or marsh plants with hastate leaves,
and tuberous, running and fibrous roots. S. japonica plena; S.
lancifolia, S. macrophylla and S. sagittifolia, are among the best
kinds, all with white flowers.

Salvia.&mdash;The Sage, a large genus of labiates, often very handsome,
but sometimes too tender for English winters. S. Sclarea, 5 to 6 ft.,
is a very striking plant little more than a biennial, with branched
panicles of bluish flowers issuing from rosy-coloured bracts; S.
patens, 2 ft., which is intense azure, has tuberous roots, and may be
taken up, stored away and replanted in spring like a dahlia. S.
pratensis, 2 ft., blue, a showy native species, is quite hardy; the
variety lupinoides has the centre of the lower lip white.

Saxifraga.&mdash;A very large genus of rock and border plants of easy
culture. The Megasea group, to which S. ligulata, S. cordifolia and
S. crassifolia belong, are early-flowering kinds of great beauty,
with fleshy leaves and large cymose clusters of flowers of various
shades of rose, red and purple. Another very distinct group with
silvery foliage&mdash;the crustaceous group&mdash;contains some of our
choicest Alpines. Of these S. caesia, S. calyciflora, S. Cotyledon are
among the best known. Some of the species look more like lichens
than flowering plants. The green moss-like saxifrages are also a
very distinct group, with dense tufted leaves which appear greener
in winter than in summer. The flowers are borne on erect branching
stems and are chiefly white in colour. Saxifraga umbrosa (London
Pride) and S. Geum belong to still another group, and are valuable
alike on border and rockery. S. peltata is unique owing to its large
peltate leaves, often 1 ft. to 18 in. across, with stalks 1 to 2 ft. long.
Flowers in April, white or pinkish. Likes plenty of water and a
moist peaty soil or marshy place. S. sarmentosa, the well-known
&ldquo;mother of thousands,&rdquo; is often grown as a pot plant in cottagers&rsquo;
windows.

Scilla.&mdash;Beautiful dwarf bulbous plants, thriving in well-worked
sandy loam, or sandy peat. S. bifolia, 3 in., and S. sibirica, 4 in.,
both intense blue, are among the most charming of early spring
flowers; S. patula, 6 to 8 in., and S. campanulata, 1 ft., with
tubular greyish-blue flowers, freely produced, are fine border plants,
as is the later-blooming S. peruviana, 6 to 8 in., dark blue or white.

Sedum.&mdash;Pretty succulent plants of easy growth, and mostly
suitable for rockwork. They are numerous, varied in the colour of
both leaves and foliage, and mostly of compact tufted growth.
S. spectabile, 1 to 1½ ft., pink, in great cymose heads, is a fine plant
for the borders, and worthy also of pot-culture for greenhouse
decoration. Mention may also be made of the common S. acre
(Stonecrop), 3 in., yellow, and its variety with yellow-tipped leaves.

Sempervivum.&mdash;House-Leek. Neat-growing, succulent plants,
forming rosettes of fleshy leaves close to the ground, and rapidly
increasing by runner-like offsets; they are well adapted for rockwork,
and do best in sandy soil. The flowers are stellate, cymose,
on stems rising from the heart of the leafy rosettes. S. arachnoideum,
purplish, S. arenarium, yellow, S. globiferum and S. Laggeri, rose,
grow when in flower 3 to 6 in. high; S. calcareum, rose colour, and
S. Boutignianum, pale rose, both have glaucous leaves tipped with
purple; S. Heuffelii, yellow, with deep chocolate leaves, and S.
Wulfeni, sulphur-yellow, are from 8 to 12 in. high.

Senecio.&mdash;A large genus with comparatively few good garden
plants. Large and coarse-growing kinds like S. Doria, S. macrophyllus
and S. sarracenicus are good for rough places; all yellow-flowered.
S. pulcher is a charming plant, 2 to 3 ft. high, with rosy-purple
flower-heads, having a bright orange centre. It likes a warm
corner and moist soil. S. clivorum, from China, has large roundish
leaves and orange-yellow flowers. It flourishes near water and in
damp places.

Shortia.&mdash;S. galacifolia, a beautiful tufted plant 2 to 3 in. high,
with roundish crenate leaves, on long stalks, and white funnel-shaped
flowers in March and April. S. uniflora from Japan is closely
related. The leaves of both assume rich purple-red tints in autumn.
Warm sunny situations and rich sandy loam and peat are required.

Silene.&mdash;Pretty caryophyllaceous plants, preferring sandy loam,
and well adapted for rockwork. S. alpestris, 6 in., white, and S.
quadridentata, 4 in., white, are beautiful tufted plants for rockwork
or the front parts of borders; S. maritima flore-pleno, 6 in., white,
S. Elizabethae, 4 in., bright rose, and S. Schafta, 6 in., purplish-rose,
are also good kinds.

Sisyrinchium.&mdash;Pretty dwarf iridaceous plants, thriving in peaty
soil. S. grandiflorum, 10 in., deep purple or white, blooms about
April, and is a fine plant for pot-culture in cold frames.

Sparaxis.&mdash;Graceful bulbous plants from South Africa. S. grandiflora,
with deep violet-purple, and S. tricolor, with rich orange-red,
flowers are best known. S. pulcherrima, a lovely species, 3 to 6 ft.
high, with drooping blood-red blossoms, is now referred to the genus
Dierama. A warm, light, but rich soil in sheltered spots required.

Spiraea.&mdash;Vigorous growing plants of great beauty, preferring
good, deep, rather moist soil; the flowers small but very abundant,
in large corymbose or spicate panicles. S. Aruncus, 4 ft., white;
S. astilbioides, 2 ft., white; S. Filipendula, 1½ ft., and S. Ulmaria,
3 ft., both white; S. palmata, 2 ft., rosy-crimson; and S. venusta,
3 ft., carmine rose, are some of the best.

Statice.&mdash;Pretty plants with broad, radical leaves, and a much-branched
inflorescence of numerous small flowers. S. latifolia, 2 ft.,
greyish-blue; S. tatarica, 1 ft., lavender-pink; S. speciosa, 1½ ft.,
rose colour; and S. eximia, 1½ ft., rosy-lilac&mdash;are good border plants.
S. bellidifolia, 9 in., lavender; S. emarginata, 6 in., purple; S.
globulariaefolia, 9 in., white; and S. nana, 4 in.&mdash;are good sorts for
the rockery.

Stenactis.&mdash;S. speciosa, 1 to 2 ft., is a showy composite, of easy
culture in good garden soil; it produces large corymbs of flower-heads,
with numerous narrow blue ray-florets surrounding the
yellow disk. Now more generally known as Erigeron.

Stipa.&mdash;S. pennata (Feather Grass), 1½ ft., is a very graceful-habited
grass, with stiff slender erect leaves, and long feathery
awns to the seeds.

Stokesia.&mdash;S. cyanea, 2 ft., is a grand, autumn-flowering, composite
plant, with blue flower-heads, 4 in. across. Sandy loam and warm
situation.

Symphytum.&mdash;Rather coarse-growing but showy boraginaceous
plants, succeeding in ordinary soil. S. caucasicum, 2 ft., with blue
flowers changing to red, is one of the finer kinds for early summer
blooming.

Thalictrum.&mdash;Free-growing but rather weedy ranunculaceous
plants, in many cases having elegantly cut foliage. T. aquilegifolium,
2 ft., purplish from the conspicuous stamens, the leaves glaucous,
is a good border plant; and T. minus has foliage somewhat resembling
that of the Maidenhair fern. Ordinary garden soil.

Tiarella.&mdash;T. cordifolia, the foam flower, is very ornamental in
border or rockery. Leaves heart-shaped lobed and toothed;
flowers white starry; ordinary garden soil.

Tigridia.&mdash;Lovely bulbous plants called tiger flowers, useful in
the warmest parts of the kingdom for the border in rich but gritty
soil. T. Pavonia, the peacock tiger flower, from Mexico, grows 1
to 2 ft. high, with plaited sword-like leaves, and large flowers about
6 in. across, having zones of violet and yellow blotched with purple
and tipped with scarlet. There are many varieties, all charming.

Trillium.&mdash;T. grandiflorum, the wood-lily of North America, is
the finest. It has large white flowers and grows freely in peaty soil
in shady borders. There are several other species, some with
purplish flowers.

Tritonia.&mdash;A genus of South African plants with fibrous-coated
corms or solid bulbs, often known as montbretas. T. crocata, 2 ft.,
orange-yellow, T. crocosmiaeflora, 2 to 2½ ft., orange-scarlet, and
T. Pottsi, 3 to 4 ft., bright yellow, are the best-known varieties, of
which there are many subsidiary ones, some being very large and
free in flowering. A rich, gritty soil, and warm, sunny situations are
best for these plants.

Triteleia.&mdash;Charming spring-flowering bulbs, thriving in any good
sandy soil. T. Murrayana, 8 in., lavender-blue, and T. uniflora,
773
6 in., white, are both pretty plants of the easiest culture, either for
borders or rockeries.

Tritoma.&mdash;Splendid stoutish-growing plants of noble aspect,
familiarly known as the Poker plant, from their erect, rigid spikes
of flame-coloured flowers; sometimes called Kniphofia. T. Uvaria,
3 to 4 ft., bright orange-red, passing to yellow in the lower flowers,
is a fine autumnal decorative plant. They should be protected
from frosts by a covering of ashes over the crown during winter.

Trollius.&mdash;Showy ranunculaceous plants, of free growth, flowering
about May and June. T. europaeus, 18 in., lemon globular; T.
asiaticus, 2 ft., deep yellow; and T. napellifolius, 2 to 2½ ft.,
golden yellow, are all fine showy kinds. Rich and rather moist
soil.

Tulipa.&mdash;Splendid dwarfish bulbs, thriving in deep, sandy, well-enriched
garden soil, and increased by offsets. They bloom during
the spring and early summer months. T. Gesneriana, the parent
of the florists&rsquo; tulip, 12 to 18 in., crimson and other colours;
T. Eichleri, 1 ft., crimson with dark spot; T. Greigi, 1 ft., orange
with dark spot edged with yellow, and having dark spotted leaves;
T. oculus solis, 1 ft., scarlet with black centre; and T. sylvestris,
12 to 18 in., bright yellow, are showy kinds.

Veratrum.&mdash;Distinct liliaceous plants with bold ornamental leaves
regularly folded and plaited. V. album, 3 to 5 ft., has whitish
blossoms in dense panicles, 1 to 2 ft. long. V. nigrum, 2 to 3 ft., has
blackish-purple flowers, also V. Maacki, 2 ft. Rich sandy loam and
peat.

Verbascum.&mdash;Showy border flowers of erect spire-like habit, of
the easiest culture. V. Chaixii, 4 to 5 ft., yellow, in large pyramidal
panicles; V. phoeniceum, 3 ft., rich purple or white; and V. formosum,
6 ft., golden yellow in dense panicles, are desirable species.

Veronica.&mdash;The Speedwell family, containing many ornamental
members; all the hardy species are of the easiest cultivation in
ordinary garden soil. The rotate flowers are in close, erect spikes,
sometimes branched. V. crassifolia, 2 ft., dark blue; V. incarnata,
1½ ft., flesh-colour; V. corymbosa, 1½ ft., pale blue in corymbosely-arranged
racemes; V. gentianoides, 2 ft., grey with blue streaks;
V. spicata, blue, and its charming white variety alba; and V.
virginica, 5 ft., white, are distinct.

Vinca.&mdash;Periwinkle. Pretty rock plants, growing freely in ordinary
soil. V. herbacea, of creeping habit, with purplish-blue flowers;
V. minor, of trailing habit, blue; and V. major, 1 to 2 ft. high, also
trailing, are suitable for the rock garden. The last two are evergreen,
and afford varieties which differ in the colour of their flowers,
while some are single and others double.

Viola.&mdash;Violet. Charming dwarf plants, mostly evergreen and of
tufted habit, requiring well-worked rich sandy soil. V. calcarata,
6 in., light blue; V. cornuta, 6 to 8 in., blue; V. lutea, 4 in., yellow;
V. altaica, 6 in., yellow or violet with yellow eye; V. palmaensis,
6 to 8 in., lavender-blue; V. pedata, 6 in., pale blue; and V. odorata,
the Sweet Violet, in its many single and double flowered varieties,
are all desirable.

Yucca.&mdash;Noble subarborescent liliaceous plants, which should be
grown in every garden. They do well in light, well-drained soils,
and have a close family resemblance, the inflorescence being a
panicle of white, drooping, tulip-shaped flowers, and the foliage
rosulate, sword-shaped and spear-pointed. Of the more shrubby-habited
sorts Y. gloriosa, recurvifolia and Treculeana are good and
distinct; and of the dwarfer and more herbaceous sorts Y. filamentosa,
flaccida and angustifolia are distinct and interesting kinds,
the first two flowering annually.

The taste for cultivation of the class of plants, of which the foregoing
list embraces some of the more prominent members, is on the
increase, and gardens will benefit by its extension.

Hardy Trees and Shrubs.&mdash;Much of the beauty of the pleasure
garden depends upon the proper selection and disposition of ornamental
trees and shrubs. We can only afford space here for lists of
some of the better and more useful and ornamental trees and shrubs,
old and new.

The following list, which is not exhaustive, furnishes material
from which a selection may be made to suit various soils and situations.
The shrubs marked * are climbers.

Bedding Plants.&mdash;This term is chiefly applied to those summer-flowering
plants, such as ivy-leaved and zonal pelargoniums, petunias,
dwarf lobelias, verbenas, &amp;c., which are employed in masses for
filling the beds of a geometrical parterre. Of late years, however,
more attention has been bestowed on arrangements of brilliant
flowering plants with those of fine foliage, and the massing also of
hardy early-blooming plants in parterre fashion has been very greatly
extended. Bedding plants thrive best in a light loam, liberally
manured with thoroughly rotten dung from an old hotbed or
thoroughly decomposed cow droppings and leaf-mould.

774

Spring Bedding.&mdash;For this description of bedding, hardy plants
only must be used; but even then the choice is tolerably extensive.
For example, there are the Alyssums, of which A. saxatile and A.
gemonense are in cultivation; Antennaria tomentosa; the double
white Arabis albida; Aubrietias, of which the best sorts are A.
Campbelliae and A. grandiflora; the double Bellis perennis or Daisy;
the Wallflowers, including Cheiranthus Cheiri (the Common Wallflower),
C. alpina and C. Marshallii; Hepaticas, the principal of
which are the varieties of H. triloba, and the blue H. angulosa;
Iberis or Candytuft; Lithospermum fruticosum; Myosotis or Forget-me-not,
including M. alpestris, M. dissitiflora, M. azorica and M.
sylvestris; Phloxes, like P. subulata, with its varieties setacea,
Nelsoni, nivalis; the single-flowered varieties of the Primrose,
Primula vulgaris; the Polyanthuses; Pyrethrum Parthenium
aureum, called Golden Feather; Sempervivum calcareum; the pink-flowered
Silene pendula; self-coloured varieties of the Pansy, V.
tricolor, and of V. lutea and V. cornuta, as well as some recent hybrids.
Besides these there are the various spring-flowering bulbs, such as
the varieties of Hyacinthus, Tulipa, Narcissus, Fritillaria, Muscari
or Grape Hyacinth, Crocus, Scilla, Chionodoxa and Galanthus or
Snowdrop.

Summer Bedding.&mdash;There is great variety amongst the plants
which are used for bedding-out in the garden during the summer
months, but we can note only some of the most important of them.
Amongst them are the Ageratums, the old tall-growing sorts of
which have been superseded by dwarfer blue and white flowered
varieties; Alternantheras, the principal of which are A. amoena,
amoena spectabilis, magnifica, paronychioides major aurea and
amabilis; Alyssum maritimum variegatum; some of the dwarf
varieties of Antirrhinum majus; Arundo Donax variegata; Begonias;
Calceolarias; Cannas; Centaurea ragusina; Clematises, of which
the hybrids of the Jackmanni type are best; Dahlia variabilis,
and the single-flowered forms of D. coccinea; Echeverias, of
which E. secunda and E. metallica are much employed; Gazanias;
Heliotropes; Iresines; Lantanas; Lobelias; Mesembryanthemum
cordifolium variegatum; Pelargoniums, of which the various classes
of zonal or bedding varieties are unapproachable for effect and general
utility; Petunias; Phloxes; Polemonium coeruleum variegatum;
Pyrethrum Parthenium aureum, the well-known Golden Feather,
especially useful as an edging to define the outline of beds upon
grass; Tropaeolums, especially some of the varieties of T. Lobbianum;
and Verbenas, the offspring of Tweedieana, chamaedrifolia
and others. Few bulbs come into the summer flower gardens, but
amongst those which should always be well represented are the
Gladiolus, the Lilium, the Tigridia and the Montbretia.

Subtropical Bedding.&mdash;Foliage and the less common flowering
plants may be used either in masses of one kind, or in groups arranged
for contrast, or as the centres of groups of less imposing or
of dwarfer-flowering subjects; or they may be planted as single
specimens in appropriate open spaces, in recesses, or as distant
striking objects terminating a vista.

Carpet Bedding consists in covering the surface of a bed, or a
series of beds forming a design, with close, low-growing plants, in
which certain figures are brought out by means of plants of a different
habit or having different coloured leaves. Sometimes, in addition
to the carpet or ground colour, individual plants of larger size and
handsome appearance are dotted symmetrically over the beds, an
arrangement which is very telling. Some of the best plants for
carpeting the surface of the beds are: Antennaria tomentosa and
Leucophytum Browni, white; Sedum acre, dasyphyllum, corsicum
and glaucum, grey; and Sedum Lydium, Mentha Pulegium gibraltarica,
Sagina subulata and Herniaria glabra, green. The Alternantheras,
Amaranthuses, Iresines and Coleus Verschaffelti furnish high
and warm colours; while Pyrethrum Parthenium aureum yields
greenish-yellow: Thymus citriodorus aureus, yellowish; Mesembryanthemum
cordifolium variegatum, creamy yellow; Centaureas
and others, white; Lobelia Erinus, blue; and the succulent Echeverias
and Sempervivums, glaucous rosettes, which last add much
to the general effect. In connexion with the various designs such
fine plants as Agave americana, Dracaena indivisa are often used as
centre-pieces.

Greenhouse Plants.&mdash;These are plants requiring the shelter of
a glass house, provided with a moderate degree of heat, of which
45° Fahr. may be taken as the minimum in winter. The house
should be opened for ventilation in all mild weather in winter, and
daily throughout the rest of the year. The following is a select list
of genera of miscellaneous decorative plants (orchids, palms and
ferns excluded; climbers are denoted by *; bulbous and tuberous
plants by &dagger;):

Stove Plants.&mdash;For the successful culture of stove plants two
houses at least, wherein different temperatures can be maintained,
should be devoted to their growth. The minimum temperature
during winter should range at night from about 55° in the cooler
to 65° in the warmer house, and from 65° to 75° by day, allowing a
few degrees further rise by sun heat. In summer the temperature
may range 10° higher by artificial heat, night and day, and will
often by sun heat run up to 90° or even 95°, beyond which it should
be kept down by ventilation and frequent syringing and damping
down of the pathways. During the growing period the atmosphere
must be kept moist by damping the walls and pathways, and by
syringing the plants according to their needs; when growth is
completed less moisture will be necessary. Watering, which, except
during the resting period, should generally be copious, is best done
in the forenoon; while syringing should be done early in the morning
before the sun becomes too powerful, and late in the afternoon to
admit of the foliage drying moderately before night. The following
is a select list of genera of stove plants (climbers are denoted by *,
bulbous and tuberous plants by &dagger;):


Acalypha Cyanophyllum (Miconia) Musa

Orchids.&mdash;For the successful cultivation of a mixed collection
of tropical orchids, it is necessary that two or three houses, in which
different temperatures can be maintained, should be provided.
The greater number of them are epiphytes or plants that grow on
others without absorbing nourishment from them, and heat and
moisture afford all or nearly all the nourishment they require. At
one time it was thought the plants themselves were better for being
associated with such objects as ferns and palms, but they are best
grown by themselves.

The East Indian orchid house takes in those species which are
found in the warm parts of the eastern hemisphere, as well as those
from the hottest parts of the western, and its temperature should
range from about 70° to 80° during the summer or growing season
and from 65° to 70° during winter. The Mexican or Brazilian orchid
house accommodates the plants from the warm parts of South
America, and its temperature should range from about 65° to 75°
during summer and from 60° to 65° in winter. A structure called
the cool orchid house is set apart for the accommodation of the many
lovely mountain species from South America and India, such as
odontoglossums, masdevallias, &amp;c., and in this the more uniform the
temperature can be kept the better, that in summer varying between
775
60° and 65°, and in winter from 45° to 60°. A genial moist atmosphere
must be kept up in the hottest houses during the growing
season, with a free circulation of air admitted very cautiously by
well-guarded ventilators. In winter, when the plants are at rest,
little water will be necessary; but in the case of those plants which
have no fleshy pseudobulbs to fall back upon for sustenance, they
must not be suffered to become so dry as to cause the leaves to
shrivel. In the Mexican house the plants will generally be able to
withstand greater drought occasionally, being greatly assisted by
their thick pseudobulbs. In the cool or odontoglossum house a
considerable degree of moisture must be maintained at all times,
for in these the plants keep growing more or less continuously.

For potting or basketing purposes, or for plants requiring block-culture,
the materials used are light fibrous peat, special leaf-mould,
osmunda or polypodium fibre and living sphagnum moss, which
supply free drainage for the copious supply of water required.
Good turfy loam is also used for some, such as cypripediums and
calanthes. Indeed the composts now used are varied considerably
according to the particular group of orchids. The water should,
however, be so used as not to run down into the sheathing bases of
the leaves. While in flower, orchids may with advantage be removed
to a drier and cooler situation, and may be utilized in the
drawing-room or boudoir. Of late years not only have many fine
hybrids been raised artificially between various species, but some
remarkable bigeneric hybrids (between what are considered two
distinct genera) have also been produced (indicated in the list
below by *). To keep a valuable collection of orchids in good
condition requires the services of an expert orchid grower.

The following is a select list of genera in cultivation:&mdash;


Acineta Cymbidium Peristeria
Ada Cypripedium Pescatorea
Aërides Cyrtopodium Phajus
Angraecum Dendrobium Phaio-calanthe*

Palms.&mdash;These form charming table and drawing-room plants
when quite young. When more fully developed, and long before
their full growth is attained, they are among the most decorative
plants known for the conservatory and for subtropical gardening.
They are easily cultivated, but should not be allowed to become
dry. The soil should consist of about 3 parts turfy loam, 1 part leaf
mould, 1 part coarse silver sand, with enough chemical or other
manure added to render the whole moderately rich. The older
plants will occasionally require the roots pruned in order to keep
them in as small pots as possible without being starved. This
should be done early in the spring, and the plants heavily shaded
until feeding roots are again produced. It is of advantage to afford
stove culture while the plants are quite young. A little later most
of the genera succeed well under moderately cool conditions.

The following genera are among those most commonly cultivated:


Acanthophoenix Chamaerops Martinezia
Acanthorhiza Cocos Oreodoxa
Areca Corypha Phoenix
Bactris Geonoma Pritchardia
Brahea Hyophorbe Rhapis
Calamus Kentia Sabal
Caryota Latania Stevensonia
Ceroxylon Livistonia Thrinax
Chamaedorea &nbsp; &nbsp;


Ferns.&mdash;These popular plants are usually increased by means of
their spores, the &ldquo;dust&rdquo; produced on the back of their fronds.
The spores should be sown in well-drained pots or seed pans on the
surface of a mixture of fibrous sifted peat and small broken crocks or
sandstone; this soil should be firmly pressed and well-watered, and
the spores scattered over it, and at once covered with propagating
glasses or pieces of sheet glass, to prevent water or dry air getting
to the surface. The pots should be placed in pans full of water,
which they will absorb as required. A shady place is desirable,
with temperature of 50° to 55° by night and 65° to 70° by day, or
they may be set on a shelf in an ordinary propagating pit. The
spores may be sown as soon as ripe, and when the young plants can
be handled, or rather can be lifted with the end of a pointed flat
stick, they should be pricked out into well-drained pots or pans
filled with similar soil and should be kept moist and shady. As
they become large enough, pot them singly in 3-in. pots, and when
the pots are fairly filled with roots shift on into larger ones.

The best time for a general repotting of ferns is in spring, just
before growth commences. Those with creeping rhizomes can be
propagated by dividing these into well-rooted portions, and, if a
number of crowns is formed, they can be divided at that season.
In most cases this can be performed with little risk, but the gleichenias,
for example, must only be cut into large portions, as small
divisions of the rhizomes are almost certain to die; in such cases,
however, the points of the rhizomes can be led over and layered into
small pots, several in succession, and allowed to remain unsevered
from the parent plant until they become well-rooted. In potting
the well-established plants, and all those of considerable size, the
soil should be used in a rough turfy state, not sifted but broken,
and one-sixth of broken crocks or charcoal and as much sand as will
insure free percolation should be mixed with it.

The stove ferns require a day temperature of 65° to 75°, but do
not thrive in an excessively high or close dry atmosphere. They
require only such shade as will shut out the direct rays of the sun,
and, though abundant moisture must be supplied, the atmosphere
should not be overloaded with it. Ferns should not be allowed to
become quite dry at the root, and the water used should always be
at or near the temperature of the house in which the plants are
growing. Some ferns, as the different kinds of Gymnogramme and
Cheilanthes, prefer a drier atmosphere than others, and the former
do not well bear a lower winter temperature than about 60° by
night. Most other stove ferns, if dormant, will bear a temperature
as low as 55° by night and 60° by day from November to February.
About the end of the latter month the whole collection should be
turned out of the pots, and redrained or repotted into larger pots
as required. This should take place before growth has commenced.
Towards the end of March the night temperature may be raised to
60°, and the day temperature to 70° or 75°, the plants being shaded
in bright weather. Such ferns as Gymnogrammes, which have their
surface covered with golden or silver powder, and certain species of
scaly-surfaced Cheilanthes and Nothochlaena, as they cannot bear
to have their fronds wetted, should never be syringed; but most
other ferns may have a moderate sprinkling occasionally (not
necessarily daily), and as the season advances, sufficient air and
light must be admitted to solidify the tissues.

Hardy British ferns belonging to such genera as Asplenium,
Nephrodium, Aspidium, Scolopendrium, have become fairly popular
of late years, and many charming varieties are now used in borders
and rockeries. Spores may be sown as above described, but in a
much lower temperature.

The following is a select list of genera:&mdash;


Acrostichum Davallia Osmunda
Actiniopteris Dicksonia Onoclea
Adiantum Gleichenia Phlebodium
Alsophila Gymnogramme Platycerium
Aspidium Hymenophyllum Polypodium
Asplenium Lastrea Pteris
Blechnum Lomaria Scolopendrium
Cheilanthes Lygodium Todea
Cibotium Nephrodium Trichomanes
Cyathea Nephrolepis Woodwardia



VI. Fruits.

Fruit-Tree Borders.&mdash;No pains should be spared, in the preparation
of fruit-tree borders, to secure their thorough drainage.
In case of adhesive clayey subsoil this can generally be secured
by placing over the sloping bottom a good layer of coarse rubbly
material, communicating with a drain in front to carry off the
water, while earthenware drain tubes may be laid beneath the
rubble from 8 to 10 ft. apart, so as to form air drains, and
provided with openings both at the side of the walk and also
near the base of the wall. Over this rubbly matter, rough turfy
soil, grass-side downwards, should be laid, and on this the good
prepared soil in which the trees are to be planted.

The borders should consist of 3 parts rich turfy loam,
the top spit of a pasture, and 1 part light gritty earth, such
as road-grit, with a small portion (one-sixth) of fine brick rubbish.
They should not be less than 12 ft. in breadth, and may vary
up to 15 or 18 ft., with a fall from the wall of about 1 in. in
3 ft. The border itself should be raised a foot or more above
the general level. The bottom of the border as well as that
776
of the drain must be kept lower than the general level of the
subsoil, else the soakage will gather in all the little depressions
of its surface. Fruit-tree borders should not be at all cropped
with culinary vegetables, or very slightly so, as the process of
digging destroys the roots of the trees, and drives them from
near the surface, where they ought to be.

Shallow planting, whether of wall trees or standards, is generally
to be preferred, a covering of a few inches of soil being
sufficient for the roots, but a surface of at least equal size to the
surface of the hole should be covered with dung or litter so as
to restrain evaporation and preserve moisture. In the case
of wall trees, a space of 5 or 6 in. is usually left between the
stem at the insertion of the roots and the wall, to allow for
increase of girth. Young standard trees should be tied to
stakes so as to prevent their roots being ruptured by the wind-waving
of the stems and to keep them erect. The best time
for planting fruit trees in the open air is from the end of September
till the end of November in open weather.

In the selection and distribution of fruit trees regard must of
course be had to local situation and climate. The best walls
having a south or south-east aspect are devoted to the peach,
nectarine, apricot, dessert pears, plums and early cherries.
Cherries and the generality of plums succeed very well either
on an east or a west aspect. Morello cherries, apples and stewing
pears succeed well on a north wall. In Scotland the mulberry
requires the protection of a wall, and several of the finer apples
and pears do not arrive at perfection without this help and a
tolerably good aspect. The wall-trees intended to be permanent
are called dwarfs, from their branches springing from near
the ground. Between these, trees with tall stems, called riders,
are planted as temporary occupants of the upper part of the
wall. The riders should have been trained in the nursery into
good-sized trees, in order that when planted out they may come
into bearing as speedily as possible.

Standard Fruit Trees should not be planted, if it can be avoided,
in the borders of the kitchen garden, but in the outer slips,
where they either may be allowed to attain their full size or
may be kept dwarfed. Each sort of fruit should be planted
by itself, for the sake of orderly arrangement, and in order to
facilitate protection when necessary by a covering of nets.
Their produce is often superior in flavour to that of the same
kind of fruit grown on walls.

Orchard-house Trees.&mdash;Peaches, nectarines, apricots, figs
and dessert plums, cherries, apples and pears are commonly
cultivated in the orchard-house. Peaches and nectarines are
generally planted out, while the rest are more commonly cultivated
in pots. This allows of the hardier pot plants being removed
out of doors while those planted out are in need of the
room. The pot plants are overhauled in the autumn, the roots
pruned, a layer being cut off to allow new soil to be introduced.
Surface dressing and feeding by liquid manure should also be
afforded these plants while the fruit is swelling. Every effort
should be made to complete the growth of peaches and nectarines
while the sun is sufficiently strong to ripen them. Tomatoes
are frequently employed to fill gaps in the orchard-house. Should
it be provided with a central path, requiring shade, Hambro
and Sweet-water grapes serve the purpose well, and in favourable
seasons afford excellent crops of fruit.

VII. Vegetables.

Under this head are included those esculents which are largely
eaten as &ldquo;vegetables&rdquo; or as &ldquo;salads.&rdquo; The more important
are treated under their individual headings (see Artichoke,
Asparagus, Bean, &amp;c. &amp;c.). The culinary herbs used for
flavouring and garnishing are for the most part dwarf perennial
plants requiring to be grown on a rich soil in an open sunny
aspect, or annuals for which a warm sheltered border is the most
suitable place; and they may therefore be conveniently grown
together in the same compartment&mdash;a herb garden. The
perennials should be transplanted either every year or every
second year. For winter use the tops of the most useful kinds
of herbs should be cut when in flower or full leaf and quite
dry, and spread out in an airy but shady place so as to part
slowly with the moisture they contain and at the same time
retain their aromatic properties. When quite dry they should
be put into dry wide-mouthed bottles and kept closely corked.
In this way such herbs as basil, marjoram, mint, sage, savory,
thyme, balm, chamomile, horehound, hyssop and rue, as well
as parsley, may be had throughout the season with almost the
full flavour of the fresh herb.

Intensive Cultivation.&mdash;This name has been applied to the
method of forcing early vegetables and salads during the winter
and spring months in the market gardens in the neighbourhood
of Paris. The system is now popularly known in England as
&ldquo;French gardening.&rdquo; Although a few assert that it is an old
English one that has been discarded in favour of superior methods,
there seems to be little or no evidence in support of this contention.
The system itself has been practised for about 300
years in the &ldquo;marais&rdquo; gardens round Paris. At one time
these gardens were in the centre of the city itself, but owing to
modern improvements they have been gradually pushed out
beyond the city boundaries farther and farther. Most of these
gardens are small&mdash;not more than a couple of acres in extent,
and the rent paid by the maraîcher, or market gardener, is very
high&mdash;as much as £30 to £40 per acre.

The French maraîcher does not use hot-water apparatus
for forcing his plants into early growth. He relies mainly upon
the best stable manure, a few shallow frames about 4½ ft. wide
covered with lights, and a number of large bell glasses or
&ldquo;cloches.&rdquo; The work is carried on from October till the end of
March and April, after which, with the exception of melons, the
cultures are carried on in the open air.

The chief crops grown for early supplies, or &ldquo;primeurs&rdquo; as
they are called, are special varieties of cos and cabbage lettuces,
short carrots, radishes, turnips, cauliflowers, endives, spinach,
onions, corn salad and celery. To these is added a very important
crop of melons, a special large-fruited variety known as the
Prescott Canteloup being the most favoured.

It is astonishing how much produce is taken off one of these
small intensive gardens during the year, and especially during
the worst months when prices usually run fairly high. The
fact that rents are so heavy around Paris is in itself an indication
of the money that is realized by the growers not only in the Paris
markets, but also in Covent Garden.

During the winter season narrow beds are made up of manure,
either quite fresh or mixed with old manure, according to the
amount of heat required. These beds are covered with a few
inches of the fine old mould obtained from the decayed manure
of previous years. In the early stages seeds of carrots and
radishes are sown simultaneously on the same beds, and over
them young lettuces that have been raised in advance are
planted. In this way three crops are actually on the same beds
at the same time. Owing, however, to the difference in their
vegetative growth, they mature one after the other instead of
simultaneously. Thus with the genial warmth and moisture of the
hotbeds, all crops grow rapidly, but the radishes mature first,
then the lettuces are taken off in due course, thus leaving the
beds to finish up with the carrots by themselves. Later on in the
season, perhaps small cauliflowers will be planted along the
margins of the beds where the carrots are growing, and will be
developing into larger plants requiring more space by the time
all the carrots have been picked and marketed. So on throughout
the year with other crops, this system of intercropping or
overlapping of one crop with another is carried out in a most
ingenious manner, not only under glass lights, but also in the open
air. Spinach, corn salad, radishes and carrots are the favourite
crops for sowing between others such as lettuces and cauliflowers.

Although enormous quantities of water are required during the
summer season, great care must be exercised in applying water
to the winter crops. When severe frost prevails the lights or
cloches are rarely taken off except to gather mature specimens;
and no water is given directly overhead to the plants for fear
of chilling them and checking growth. They must secure their
777
supply of moisture from the rain that falls on the glass, and
flows into the narrow pathways from 9 in. to 12 in. wide between
each range of frames. As the beds are only about 4½ ft. wide,
the water from the pathways is soaked up on each side by
capillary attraction, and in this way the roots secure a sufficient
supply.

Besides an abundance of water in summer there must also
be an enormous quantity of good stable manure available during
the winter months. This is necessary not only to make up the
required hotbeds in the first place, but also to fill in the pathways
between the frames, wherever it is considered advisable to
maintain the heat within the frames at a certain point. As it is
impossible to use an ordinary wheelbarrow in these narrow
pathways, the workman carries a specially made wicker basket
called a &ldquo;hotte&rdquo; on his shoulders by means of two straps.
In this way large quantities of manure are easily transported
to any required spot, and although the work looks hard to an
English gardener, the Frenchman says he can carry more
manure with less fatigue in half a day than an Englishman can
transport in a day with a wheelbarrow.

This is merely an outline of the system, which is now being
taken up in various parts of the United Kingdom, but not too
rapidly. The initial expenses for frames, lights, cloches, mats
and water-supply are in many cases prohibitive to men with
the necessary gardening experience, while on the other hand
those who have the capital lack the practical knowledge so
essential to success.


For full details of this system see French Market-Gardening, with
details of Intensive Cultivation, by John Weathers (London, 1909).

VIII.&mdash;Calendar of Garden Operations (A) for Great Britain.

January

Kitchen Garden.&mdash;Wheel out manure and composts during frosty
weather; trench vacant ground not turned up roughly in autumn.
Sow early peas in a cold frame for transplanting. Sow also first-crop
peas, early in the month, and William I. towards the end; Early
Seville and Early Longpod beans; and short-topped radish in two
or three sowings, at a week&rsquo;s interval, all on a warm border; also
Hardy Green and Brown cos lettuce in a frame or on south border.
Plant shallots and Ashleaf potatoes on a warm border. Protect
broccoli as it becomes fit for use, or remove to a dry shed or cellar;
lettuces and endive, which are best planted in frames; and parsley
in frames so as to be accessible.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Plant fruit trees in open weather, if not done in
autumn, which is the proper season, mulching over the roots to
protect them from frost, and from drought which may occur in
spring. Prune fruit trees in mild weather or in moderate frosts,
nailing only in fine weather. Wash trees infested with insects with
one of the many insecticides now obtainable. Take off grafts, and
lay them aside in moist earth in a shady place.

Forcing.&mdash;Prepare manure for making up hotbeds for early
cucumbers and melons, where pits heated with hot water are not in
use; also for Ashleaf potatoes. Sow also in heat mustard and cress
for salads, onions for salads; tomatoes, celery to be pricked out for
an early crop; and Early Horn carrot and kidney-beans on slight
hotbeds. Force asparagus, sea-kale and rhubarb, in hotbeds, in
pits, in the mushroom-house or in the open garden by the use of
covers surrounded with warm litter; for cucumbers a top heat of
70°; for vines in leaf and flower a temperature ranging from 65°
to 70°. Keep forced strawberries with swelling fruit well watered.
Plant vine eyes for propagation in a brisk heat.

Plant Houses.&mdash;Give abundance of air to the greenhouse, conservatory
and alpine frame in mild weather, but use little water.
A supply of roses, kalmias, rhododendrons, &amp;c., and of hardy flowers
and bulbs, as lily of the valley, hyacinths, tulips, daffodils, &amp;c.,
should be kept up by forcing.

Flower Garden.&mdash;Plant out tubers and bulbs of border flowers,
where neglected in autumn, deferring the finer florists&rsquo; flowers till
next month. Transplant herbaceous plants in light soils, if not
done in autumn; also deciduous trees, shrubs and hedges. Lay
edgings in fine weather. Sow mignonette, stocks, &amp;c., in pots;
sow sweet peas and a few hardy annuals on a warm border. Give
auriculas and carnations abundance of air, but keep the roots rather
dry to prevent damping off.

February

Kitchen Garden.&mdash;Sow successional crops of Early Seville beans,
and William I., American Wonder or other peas in the beginning
and end of the month; early cabbages to follow the last sowing in
August; red cabbages and savoys towards the end. Sow also Early
Horn carrot; Early Purple-top Munich turnip; onions for a full
crop in light soils, with a few leeks and some parsley. Sow lettuce
for succession, with radishes and Round-leaved spinach, twice in the
course of the month; and small salads every fortnight. Plant
Jerusalem artichokes, shallots, garlic, horse-radish and early
potatoes. Transplant to the bottom of a south wall a portion of
the peas sown in pots in frames in November and January for the
first crop. Sow Brussels sprouts in gentle heat for an early crop.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Prune apricots, peaches, nectarines and plums,
before the buds are much swelled; finish pruning apples, pears,
cherries, gooseberries, currants and raspberries, before the end of
the month; also the dressing of vines. Keep the fruit-room free
from spoiled fruit, and shut it close. Cut down the double-bearing
raspberries to secure strong autumn-fruiting shoots. Head back
stocks preparatory to grafting.

Forcing.&mdash;Sow melons and cucumbers on hotbeds and in pits.
Sow carrots, turnips, early celery, also aubergines or egg-plants,
capsicums, tomatoes and successional crops of kidney-beans;
cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, in gentle heat, to be afterwards
planted out. Plant early potatoes on slight hotbeds. Continue
the forcing of asparagus, rhubarb and sea-kale. Commence or
continue the forcing of the various choice fruits, as vines, peaches,
figs, cherries, strawberries, &amp;c. Pot roots of mint and place in heat
to produce sprigs for mint sauce. Be careful to protect the stems
of vines that are outside the forcing-houses.

Plant Houses.&mdash;Let the greenhouse and conservatory have plenty
of air in mild weather. Pot and start tuberous-rooted begonias and
gloxinias. Pot young plants of Hippeastrum, and start the
established ones. Propagate chrysanthemums in cool-house or
vinery under hand lights or frames. Put plants of fuchsias, petunias,
verbenas, heliotropes, salvias and other soft-wooded subjects, into
a propagating house to obtain cuttings, &amp;c., for the flower garden.
Sow stocks, dahlias and a few tender and half-hardy annuals, on
a slight hotbed, or in pots. Propagate old roots of dahlias by
cuttings of the young shoots in a hotbed. Sow petunias in heat,
and prick out and harden for bedding out; also gloxinias to be
grown on in heat till the flowering season.

Flower Garden.&mdash;In dry open weather plant dried roots, including
most of the finer florists&rsquo; flowers; continue the transplanting of
hardy biennial flowers and herbaceous plants. Sow in the last
week mignonette, and hardy annuals, in a warm border, for subsequent
transplanting.

March

Kitchen Garden.&mdash;Sow main crops of wrinkled marrow peas;
Longpod and Windsor beans; cabbage, onions, leeks, Early Horn
carrots, parsnips, salsafy, scorzonera, Brussels sprouts, borecoles,
lettuces and spinach. In the beginning and also at the end of the
month sow Early Strap-leaf and Early Snowball turnips and savoys.
In the last fortnight sow asparagus, cauliflower and the various
sweet and savoury herbs; also sea-kale, radishes, celery, celeriac
and parsley. Small salads should be sown every ten days. Make
up beds for mushrooms with well-prepared dung towards the end
of the month. Plant early potatoes in the first week, and a main
crop during the last fortnight. Sea-kale, asparagus and peas raised
in frames may now be planted; also garlic and shallots. Full crops
of cabbages should be planted out; also cauliflowers under hand-glasses.
Propagate by slips, or by earthing up the old stems, the
various pot-herbs.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Finish the pruning of fruit trees before the middle
of the month. Protect those coming into blossom. Begin grafting
in the third week; dig and dress between the rows of gooseberries,
currants and other fruit trees, if not already done. Kill wasps
assiduously as soon as they appear.

Forcing.&mdash;Continue the forcing of melons, cucumbers, tomatoes
and the various fruits. In the vinery and peach-house, attend to
the keeping down of insects by syringing; and promote the growth
of the young shoots, by damping the walls and paths morning and
evening. Sow capsicum and tomato; also in slight heat such tender
herbs as basil and marjoram.

Plant Houses.&mdash;More water may be given than formerly. Sow
seeds of greenhouse and hothouse plants; also the different sorts of
tender annuals; pot off those sown last month; sow cineraria for
the earliest bloom; also Chinese primulas. Shift heaths and other
hard-wooded subjects and stove-plants; plant tuberoses in pots
for forcing. Begin to propagate greenhouse plants by cuttings; also
coleuses by cuttings in heat, potting them off as soon as rooted.

Flower Garden and Shrubbery.&mdash;In the last week, sow hardy
annuals in the borders, with biennials that flower the first season,
as also perennials. Plant anemone and ranunculus roots and
the corms of gladiolus. Transplant from the nursery to their final
sites annuals sown in autumn, with biennials and herbaceous plants.
Propagate perennials from root-slips and offsets. Continue to
propagate the finer sorts of dahlias, both by cuttings and by division
of the roots. Finish the pruning of all deciduous trees and hedges
as soon as possible. Attend to the dressing of shrubberies; lay
turf-edgings, and regulate the surface of gravel walks.

April

Kitchen Garden.&mdash;Sow asparagus, sea-kale, Turnip-rooted beet,
salsafy, scorzonera, skirret, carrots and onions on heavy soils; also
marrow peas, Longpod and Windsor beans, turnips, spinach, celery,
778
cabbage, savoys and Brussels sprouts for succession. Sow broccoli
and kidney-beans both in the second and in the last week, and
lettuces and small salads twice or thrice during the month; sow
all herbs, if not done last month. Sow vegetable marrow. Plant
cauliflower, cabbages, sea-kale, lettuce; and finish the planting of
the main crops of potatoes; divide and replant globe-artichokes.
Propagate all sorts of pot-herbs, and attend to the hoeing and
thinning of spinach, onions, turnips, carrots, beet, &amp;c. Earth up
cabbages, cauliflower, peas, beans and early potatoes. Stake up
peas; blanch sea-kale and rhubarb in the open air by covering with
straw or leaves.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;If vines have been neglected to be pruned, rub
off the buds that are not wanted; this is safer than pruning now.
Protect the finer sorts of fruit trees on the walls. The hardier
orchard-house fruits should now be moved outdoors under temporary
awnings, to give the choicer fruits more space,&mdash;the roots being
protected by plunging the pots. Mulch all newly-planted fruit trees,
watering abundantly in dry weather.

Forcing.&mdash;Continue the preparation of succession beds and pits
for cucumbers and melons. Sow; pot tomatoes and capsicums for
succession. Pollinate tomatoes by hand to ensure early fruit on
plants intended for outdoor culture. In the forcing-houses, from
the variable state of the weather, considerable vigilance is required
in giving air. Keep down red spider (Acarus) in the more advanced
houses by frequent syringings and a well-moistened atmosphere.
Continue the usual operations of disbudding and thinning of fruit,
and take care to keep up the proper temperatures.

Plant Houses.&mdash;Still sow tender annuals if required; also cinerarias
and primulas. Proceed with all necessary shiftings. Propagate rare
and fine plants by cuttings or grafting; increase bouvardias by
cuttings, and grow on for winter flowering. Pot off tender annuals,
and cuttings of half-hardy greenhouse plants put in during February
to get them well established for use in the flower garden. Transfer
chrysanthemums to sheltered positions out of doors, and provide
means of protecting them from frost and cutting winds.

Flower Garden and Shrubbery.&mdash;Sow main or successional crops
of annuals of all sorts&mdash;half-hardy annuals in warm borders, or on
slight hotbeds. Biennials and perennials should be sown before
the middle of the month. Plant out gladioli, if not done, tigridias
and fine stocks. Finish the transplanting of herbaceous plants by
the end of the first week. Cuttings of border chrysanthemums may
now be dibbled in a warm spot out of doors. Protect stage auriculas
and hyacinths from extremes of every description of weather; and
tulips from hoar-frosts and heavy rains. Plant out tender deciduous
trees and shrubs raised in pots; plant out tea-roses, mulching the
roots. Remove part of the coverings of all tender shrubs and
plants in the first week, and the remainder at the end of the month.
Form and repair lawns and grass walks by laying turf and sowing
perennial grass-seeds; mow the lawns frequently; plant evergreens.

May

Kitchen Garden.&mdash;Sow main crop of beet in the first week, small
salads every week, radishes and lettuces thrice, spinach once a
fortnight, carrots and onions for late drawing, kidney-beans in the
first week and together with scarlet runners in the last fortnight;
endive for an early crop; also peas and Longpod and Windsor
beans, cauliflowers, Early York or Little Pixie cabbages, Brussels
sprouts, borecole, broccoli, savoys and kale for late crops. Sow
vegetable marrows and hardy cucumbers on a warm border in the
last week; sow cardoons in trenches, or (in the north) in pots under
glass shelter; sow chicory for salading. Continue hoeing and earthing
up the several crops.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Disbud peaches, nectarines and other early trees
against the walls; also attend to the thinning of fruit. Give
occasional washings with the engine to keep down insects. Pick
caterpillars from gooseberries and wall trees on their first appearance.
Remove from raspberries and strawberries all suckers and runners
that are not wanted.

Forcing.&mdash;Plant melons and cucumbers on the hotbeds prepared
for vegetables in February, and now free. Plant out vegetable
marrows and pumpkins on dung-ridges, under hand-glasses. Sow
late crops of cucumbers and melons.

Plant Houses.&mdash;Turn out hardy plants about the middle, and the
more tender at the latter end of the month. Sow tender annuals
for succession, potting and shifting those sown at an earlier period;
sow cinerarias for succession; and a few hardy annuals and ten-week
stock, &amp;c., for late crops. Pot off all rooted cuttings. Put
in cuttings of the different desirable species which are now fit for
that purpose. Plant out in rich soil Richardias, to be potted up in
autumn for flowering. Bedding plants should be placed to harden
in sheltered positions out of doors towards end of month. Towards
the end of the month many of the main stock of chrysanthemums
will be ready for the final potting.

Flower Garden.&mdash;Sow annuals for succession in the last week,
also biennials and perennials in the nursery compartment, for
planting out next year. Propagate plants of which more stock is
required either by cuttings or by dividing the roots. Plant out,
during the last week, dahlias, hardy pelargoniums, stocks and
calceolarias, protecting the dahlias from slight frosts. By the end
of the month, masses of the following plants may be formed with
safety in warm localities:&mdash;pelargonium, heliotropium, fuchsia,
petunia, nierembergia, salvia, verbena, bouvardia and lobelia.
Protect tulips, ranunculuses and anemones from the mid-day sun,
and from rains and winds. Remove the coverings from all tender
plants in the open air.

Shrubbery.&mdash;Transplant all kinds of evergreens, this month and
September being the proper seasons. The rarer conifers should
be planted now and in June, after they have commenced to grow.
Proceed with the laying down of lawns and gravel-walks, and keep
the former regularly mown.

June

Kitchen Garden.&mdash;Sow kidney-beans for succession; also the
wrinkled marrow peas and Seville Longpod and Windsor beans for
late crops. Sow salading every ten days; also carrots, onions
and radishes for drawing young; and chicory for salads; sow
endive for a full crop. In the first week sow Early Munich and
Golden Ball turnips for succession, and in the third week for a full
autumn crop. Sow scarlet and white runner beans for a late crop,
and cabbages for coleworts. Make up successional mushroom beds
early in the month. Plant full crops of broccoli, Brussels sprouts,
savoys, kales, leeks and early celery, with successional crops of
cabbage and cauliflower. In the first fortnight of the month, plant
hardy cucumbers for pickling, in a warm border, placing hand-glasses
over them towards the end of the month. Plant out capsicums
and tomatoes in sunny positions, and stake and tie securely.
Pull and store winter onions, if ripe.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Train and prune the summer shoots of wall and
trellis and other trained trees. Mulch and water fruit trees and
strawberries in dry weather, desisting when the fruit begins to ripen.
Net over cherry-trees. Destroy aphides and other insects by
syringing with tobacco water, or by fumigating, or by dusting with
tobacco powder.

Forcing.&mdash;Proceed with planting melons, cucumbers and tomatoes.
Keep up the necessary temperatures for the ripening of
the various fruits. Ventilation will still require constant care.
Tomatoes will now be fruiting freely; thin out judiciously,
avoiding excessive pruning at one time. Attend to the gathering
of fruit as it ripens.

Plant Houses.&mdash;These will now be occupied with tender greenhouse
plants and annuals, and the more hardy plants from the stove.
Shift, repot and propagate all plants that are desirable. Sow fragrant
or showy annuals to flower in pots during winter; and grow on a
set of decorative plants for the same object. Continue the final
potting of chrysanthemums as the plants become ready.

Flower Garden.&mdash;Plant out dahlias and other tender subjects, if
risk of frost is past. Take up bulbs and tuberous roots and dry
them in the shade before removing them to the store-room. Fill
up with annuals and greenhouse plants those beds from which the
bulbs and roots have been raised. After this season, keep always
a reserve of annuals in pots, or planted on beds of thin layers of
fibrous matter, so as to be readily transplanted. Layer carnations
and pipe pinks in the end of the month. Keep the lawns closely
mown.

July

Kitchen Garden.&mdash;Watering will be necessary in each department,
if the weather is hot and dry. In the first week, sow peas for the last
crop of the season; also Longpod beans and French beans. In the
last week, sow red globe or Chirk Castle turnip for a full winter crop,
spinach for an early winter supply and Enfield Market cabbage
for early summer use. Sow endive, for autumn and winter use, in
the beginning and end of the month; also successional crops of
lettuce and small salads. Make up successional mushroom beds.
Plant full crops of celery, celeriac, endive about the middle and end
of the month; late crops of broccoli, cauliflower and coleworts in the
last week. Gather and dry herbs; also propagate these by slips
and cuttings.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Continue the pruning and training of wall and
espalier trees, and the destruction of noxious insects. Pot strawberries
for forcing next winter, and make new beds out of doors as
soon as well-rooted runners can be obtained. Propagate the different
sorts of stone fruit trees by budding on other trees or on prepared
stocks. Gather fruits of all kinds as they ripen.

Forcing.&mdash;Prune melons and cucumbers, giving air and water and
maintaining heat, &amp;c. Continue the routine treatment in the tomato-houses.
Feed the plants artificially as soon as good crops are set;
do not wait for signs of distress. The forcing-houses ought to have
abundance of fresh air and moisture where required, along with the
necessary heat.

Plant Houses.&mdash;Ventilation will be necessary to keep down excessive
heat; and attention must be paid to potting, shifting and
putting in cuttings, and giving abundance of water to the potted
plants, both indoors and out. Sow seed of herbaceous calceolarias;
shift heaths, if they require it; cut down pelargoniums past flowering,
and plant the cuttings.

Flower Garden and Shrubbery.&mdash;Take up the remaining tuberous
roots, such as anemones, ranunculuses, &amp;c., by the end of the first
week; fill up their places, and any vacancies that may have occurred,
with annuals or bedding plants from the reserve ground.
779
Repot auriculas, and sow auricula seed in boxes under glass. Propagate
herbaceous and other plants that have gone out of flower,
by means of cuttings and slips, especially those required for spring
bedding; propagate also the various summer bedding plants increased
by cuttings. Increase roses and American shrubs, by layering,
budding or cuttings, and go on with the layering of carnations
and picotees. Stake and tie up dahlias and strong herbaceous
plants.

August

Kitchen Garden.&mdash;Sow winter and spring spinach in the beginning
and about the end of the month; parsley and winter onions, for a
full crop, in the first week; cabbages about the middle of the
month, for planting out in spring; cauliflower in the first half
(Scotland) and in the second half (England) of the month; Hardy
Hammersmith and Brown Cos lettuce in the first and last week;
small salads occasionally; and Black Spanish radish, for winter
crops. Plant out kales and broccoli for late crops; plant celery
(earthing up the advancing crops as required), endive for succession,
and a few coleworts. Take up shallots, garlic, &amp;c.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Proceed in training and regulating the summer
shoots of all fruit trees as directed for the last three months. Net
up, in dry weather, gooseberry and currant bushes, to preserve the
fruit till late in the autumn. Make new strawberry beds if required.
Preserve the ripening fruits on the wall and other trees from insects,
and destroy wasp nests. Gather fruits as they ripen.

Forcing.&mdash;The routine of cultivation in hotbeds and pits may be
continued. Sow tomatoes and cucumbers for a winter crop. Make
up mushroom beds. In the forcing-houses, where the crops are past,
part of the sashes may be removed, so as to permit thorough ventilation.

Plant Houses.&mdash;Attend to the propagation of all sorts of greenhouse
plants by cuttings, and to the replacing in the greenhouse and
stoves the more tender species, by the end of the month in ordinary
seasons, but in wet weather in the second week. Sow half-hardy
annuals, as Nemophila, Collinsia, Schizanthus, Rhodanthe, &amp;c., to
flower during winter.

Flower Garden and Shrubbery.&mdash;Sow in the second and the last
week, on a warm border of a light sandy soil, with an east aspect,
any free-flowering hardy annuals as Silene pendula, Nemophila, &amp;c.,
for planting in spring; and auricula and primula seeds in pots
and boxes. Propagate, all sorts of herbaceous plants by rooted
slips or suckers; take off layers of carnations, picotees and
pansies. Plant cuttings of bedding plants, and of bedding pelargoniums
in boxes for convenience of removal. Layer the tops of
chrysanthemums, to obtain dwarf flowering plants. Transplant
evergreens in moist weather, about the end of the month; and propagate
them by layers and cuttings. Pot Neapolitan violets for
forcing; or plant out on a mild hotbed. Clip box edgings.

September

Kitchen Garden.&mdash;Sow small salading for late crops; and lettuce
and spinach, if not done last month, for spring crops. Plant endive
and lettuce at the foot of a south wall to stand the winter; plant
out cabbages from the chief autumn sowing. Plant cauliflowers on
a warm border in spaces such as can be protected by hand-lights.
Thin the winter spinach, when large enough, that it may have space
to grow. If broccoli be too rank or tall to withstand the winter,
lift and lay nearly up to the neck in the earth, the heads sloping
towards the north. Lift onions, and lay them out to ripen on a
dry border or gravel-walk. Lift potatoes and store them.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Finish the summer pruning and training. Where
the walls are heated, assist the maturing of peaches and nectarines,
and the ripening of the young wood for next year, by fires during
the day. Gather and lay up in the fruit-room with care the autumnal
sorts of apples and pears. Prepare borders and stations for fruit
trees during dry weather. Plant strawberries for a main crop.
Repot orchard-house trees, disrooting if necessary.

Forcing.&mdash;Take care that late melons, cucumbers and tomatoes be
not injured by getting too much water and too little air. Sow a few
kidney beans for an early forced crop. Expel damp, and assist the
ripening of late grapes and peaches with fires during the day.
Prune early vines and peaches.

Plant Houses.&mdash;The various pot plants should now be put in
their winter quarters. Keep up moderate temperatures in the stove,
and merely repel frosts in the greenhouse, guarding against damp,
by ventilation and by the cautious use of water. Pot hyacinths,
tulips and other bulbs for forcing; and propagate half-hardy
plants by cuttings. Begin the housing of the main stock of chrysanthemums.

Flower Garden, &amp;c.&mdash;Sow in the beginning of this month all half-hardy
annuals required for early flowering; also mignonette in pots,
thinning the plants at an early stage; the different species of primula;
and the seeds of such plants as, if sown in spring, seldom come up
the same season, but if sown in September and October, vegetate
readily the succeeding spring. Put in cuttings of bedding pelargoniums
in boxes, which may stand outdoors exposed to the sun, but
should be sheltered from excessive rains. Continue the propagation
of herbaceous plants, taking off the layers of carnations, picotees,
pansies and chrysanthemums, by the end of the month; choice
carnations and picotees may be potted and wintered in cold frames
if the season is wet and ungenial. Plant evergreens; lay and
put in cuttings of most of the hard-wooded sorts of shrubby
plants.

October

Kitchen Garden.&mdash;Sow small salading and radishes in the first
week, and lettuces in frames on a shallow hotbed for planting out in
spring. If the winter prove mild they will be somewhat earlier
than those sown next month or in January. Plant parsley in pots
or boxes to protect under glass in case very severe weather occurs.
Plant cabbages in beds or close rows till wanted in spring; and
cauliflowers in the last week, to receive the protection of frames, or
a sheltered situation. Store potatoes, beet, salsafy, scorzonera,
skirret, carrots and parsnips, by the end of the month. Band and
earth up cardoons.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Such fruit trees as have dropped their leaves may
be transplanted; this is the best season for transplanting (though
with care it may be done earlier), whether the leaves have fallen or
not. Protect fig-trees, if the weather proves frosty, as soon as they
have cast their leaves. Plant out raspberries. The orchard-house
trees should be got under glass before the end of the month. Gather
and store all sorts of apples and pears, the longest-keeping sorts
not before the end of the month, if the weather be mild.

Forcing.&mdash;Maintain the heat in hotbeds and pits by means of
fresh dung linings. Give abundance of air in mild bright weather.
Dress vines and peaches. Clean and repair the forcing-houses, and
overhaul the heating apparatus to see it is in good working condition.
Plant chicory in boxes or on hotbeds for blanching. Sow
kidney beans. Make up successional winter mushroom beds.

Plant Houses.&mdash;Replace all sorts of greenhouse plants. Fill the
pits with pots of stocks, mignonette and hardy annuals for planting
out in spring, along with many of the hardy sorts of greenhouse
plants; the whole ought to be thoroughly ventilated, except in
frosty weather. From this time till spring keep succulent plants
almost without water. Begin to force roses, hyacinths and a few
other bulbs, for winter and early spring decoration. Plant hyacinths
in glasses for windows. The last of the pot chrysanthemums should
be housed by the end of the first week.

Flower Garden.&mdash;Sow a few pots of hardy annuals in a frame, or
on a sheltered border, for successional spring use if required. Plant
the greater part of the common border bulbs, as hyacinths, narcissi,
crocuses and early tulips, about the end of the month, with a few
anemones for early flowering. Transplant strong plants of biennials
and perennials to their final situations; also the select plants used
for spring bedding. Protect alpine plants, stage auriculas, and choice
carnations and picotees with glass frames; and tea roses and other
tender plants with bracken or other protective material. Take up,
dry and store dahlias and all tender tubers at the end of the month;
pot lobelias and similar half-hardy plants from the open borders.
Transplant all sorts of hardy evergreens and shrubs, especially in dry
soils, giving abundance of water. Put in cuttings of all sorts of evergreens,
&amp;c. Plant out the hardier sorts of roses.

November

Kitchen Garden.&mdash;Trench up all vacant ground as soon as cleared
of its crops, leaving the surface as rough as possible. Sow early peas
and Early Dwarf Prolific beans in the second week, for an early
crop; also in frames for transplanting. Protect endive, celery,
artichoke and sea-kale with stable-litter or fern, or by planting the
former in frames; take up late cauliflower, early broccoli and lettuces,
and place them in sheltered pits or lay them in an open shed; earth
up celery; manure and dress up asparagus beds.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Plant all sorts of fruit trees in fine weather&mdash;the
earlier in the month the better. Protect fig-trees. Commence
pruning and nailing. Gather and store the latest apples and pears.
Examine the fruit-room and remove all decayed fruit.

Forcing.&mdash;Keep up the requisite degree of heat in hotbeds and
pits. Cucumbers and tomatoes will require more than ordinary
attention. Force asparagus, rhubarb and sea-kale, in the mushroom-house,
in pits, or in the open border under boxes or cases surrounded
and covered by well-fermented stable dung and leaves. Sow Early
Horn carrot; also kidney beans and radishes, on hotbeds. In the
forcing-houses prune and train the trees; fork over and dress the
borders of such houses as have not been already done.

Plant Houses.&mdash;The directions for the greenhouse and conservatory
in January apply also to this month generally. Continue the forcing
of roses, hyacinths, &amp;c. Houses containing large-flowered Japanese
chrysanthemums will require to be kept dry, airy and moderately
warm to prevent &ldquo;damping-off&rdquo; of petals.

Flower Garden, &amp;c.&mdash;Plant dried tubers of border flowers, but the
finer sorts had better be deferred till spring. Plant tulips in the
early part of the month. Put in cuttings of bedding calceolarias,
choosing the shoots that will not run up to flower. Protect such
half-hardy plants as are not already sheltered. Plant deciduous
trees and shrubs so long as the weather continues favourable, and
before the soil has parted with the solar heat absorbed during summer.
Dig and dress such flower borders and shrubberies as may now be
cleared of annuals and the stems of herbaceous plants.

780

December

Kitchen Garden.&mdash;Collect and smother-burn all vegetable refuse,
and apply it as a dressing to the ground. Sow a few peas and beans,
in case of accident to those sown in November, drawing up the soil
towards the stems of those which are above ground as a protection;
earth up celery; blanch endive with flower-pots; sow radishes in a
very sheltered place. Attend to trenching and digging in dry
weather.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Plant all sorts of fruit trees in mild weather.
Proceed with pruning and nailing wall-trees. Examine the fruit-room
every week, removing promptly all decaying fruit.

Forcing.&mdash;The same degree of attention to hotbeds and pits will be
necessary as in the last month. Continue the forcing of asparagus,
rhubarb and sea-kale, in pits and in the mushroom-house. Proceed
with the usual routine of culture commenced last month. Make
the necessary preparations to begin forcing early or succession crops
by the last week of this or the first of next month.

Plant Houses, Frames, &amp;c.&mdash;Carnations and picotees in pots must
be kept rather dry to prevent damping off. Heaths and Australian
plants must be very sparingly watered, and kept with only fire heat
enough to repel frost. Cut down plants of chrysanthemums, which
should be placed in a cool pit, near the glass, in order to afford hard
sturdy cuttings in February. Shy plants should be given gentle
bottom heat to induce growth, which should be gently hardened by
exposure under cooler conditions.

Flower Garden, &amp;c.&mdash;Plant shrubs in open weather. Prune shrubs.
Sweep and roll the lawns, and put in repair the gravel-walks, keeping
the surface frequently rolled.
(J. Ws.; W. R. W.)

(B) For the United States (chiefly for the latitude of New York).

January

Flower Garden and Greenhouse.&mdash;Little is to be done in either.
In the greenhouse care must be used to protect against frost. Ventilate
but little, and with care; raise the ventilating sash only high
enough to let the heated air from the greenhouse drive back the
outer air so as not to chill the plants. To destroy the red spider,
syringe the plants copiously at night, and splash the paths with
water. The aphis, or &ldquo;green fly,&rdquo; must also be destroyed; tobacco
may be used. Various new preparations are coming on the market
for the destruction of greenhouse pests. Several new effective
preparations of tobacco have been brought into use. The white-fly
is now a common pest in greenhouses, the nymphs being greenish
scale-like objects on the under sides of the leaves, and adults very
small white flies. The remedy is to spray with kerosene emulsion
or whale-oil soap; or if on cucumbers or tomatoes, it is best to
fumigate with hydrocyanic acid gas, using one ounce of potassium
cyanide to each 1000 cubic ft. of space. (This material is very
poisonous.) Many greenhouse insects can be kept more or less in
check by careful and effective hosing of the plants at proper times.
At this season roses, grape vines and other plants are often affected
by mildew; an effectual remedy is to paint the hot-water pipes with
a mixture of sulphur and lime, put on as thick as ordinary whitewash,
once each week until it is checked; but care must be taken
not to apply it on any surface at a higher temperature than 212°.
Hyacinths and other bulbs that have been kept in a cellar or other
dark cool place may now be brought into the light of the greenhouse
or sitting-room, provided they have filled the pots with roots. If
they are not well rooted, leave them until they are, or select such of
them as are best, leaving the others. In the outside flower garden
little can be done except that shrubs may be pruned, or new work,
such as making walks or grading, performed, if weather permits. See
that the ornamental plants and trees are not injured by heavy
weights of ice or snow.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Pruning, staking up or mulching can be done if the
weather is such that the workmen can stand out. In all warm or
comfortable days the fruit trees may be pruned.

Grapery.&mdash;Graperies used for the forcing of foreign grapes may be
started, beginning at a temperature of 50° at night, with 10° or 15°
higher during the day. The borders must be covered sufficiently
deep with leaves or manure to prevent the soil from freezing, as it
would be destruction to the vines to start the shoots if the roots were
frozen; hence, when forcing is begun in January, the covering should
be put on in November, before severe frosts begin.

Vegetable Garden.&mdash;But little can be done in the northern states
except to prepare manure, and get sashes, tools, &amp;c., in working
order; but in sections of the country where there is little or no frost
the hardier kinds of seeds and plants may be sown and planted, such
as asparagus, cabbage, cauliflower, carrot, leek, lettuce, onion, parsnip,
peas, spinach, turnip, &amp;c. In any section where these seeds can
be sown in open ground, it is an indication that hotbeds may be
started for the sowing of such tender vegetables as tomatoes, egg
and pepper plants, &amp;c.; though, unless in the extreme southern
states, hotbeds should not be started before the beginning or middle
of February. Make orders for the spring seeds.

February

Flower Garden and Greenhouse.&mdash;The directions for January will in
the main apply to this month, except that now some of the hardier
annuals may be sown in hotbed or greenhouse, and also the propagation
of plants by cuttings may be done rather better now than in
January, as the greater amount of light gives more vitality to the
cutting.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;But little can be done in most of the northern
states as yet, and in sections where there is no frost in the ground
it is likely to be too wet to work; but in many southern states this
will be the best month for planting fruit trees and plants of all kinds,
particularly strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, pear and apple
trees, while grape vines will do, though they will also do well quite a
month later. Continue the pruning. Fruit trees for spring planting
should be ordered, if not already done.

Grapery.&mdash;The graperies started last month at 50° at night may
now be increased to 60°, with a correspondingly higher day temperature.
Great care must be taken to syringe the leaves thoroughly at
least once a day, and to deluge the paths with water, so as to produce
a moist atmosphere. Paint the hot-water pipes with sulphur
mixture, as recommended in January.

Vegetable Garden.&mdash;Leaves from the woods, house manure or
refuse hops from breweries may be got together towards the latter
part of this month, and mixed and turned to get &ldquo;sweetened&rdquo;
preparatory to forming hotbeds. Cabbage, lettuce and cauliflower
seeds, if sown early this month in hotbed or greenhouse, will make fine
plants if transplanted into hotbed in March. This is preferable
to the use of fall-sown plants. Manure that is to be used for the crop
should be broken up as fine as possible, for the more completely
manure of any kind can be mixed with the soil the better the crop
will be, and, of course, if it is dug or ploughed in in large unbroken
lumps it cannot be properly commingled.

March

Flower Garden and Greenhouse.&mdash;The long days and bright sunshine
will now begin to tell on the plants under glass. Examine all
plants that are vigorous and healthy; if the roots have matted the
&ldquo;ball&rdquo; of earth they must be shifted into a larger-sized pot. Plants
from cuttings struck last month may now be shifted, and the propagation
of all plants that are likely to be wanted should be continued.
Hardier kinds of annuals may be sown; it is best done in shallow
boxes, say 2 in. deep.

Lawns can be raked off and mulched with short manure, or rich
garden earth where manure cannot be obtained. Flower-beds on
light soils may be dug up so as to forward the work of the coming
busy spring season. Lawns may be benefited by a good dressing, in
addition to the manure, of some reliable commercial fertilizer. If
the lawn is thin in spots, these places may be raked over heavily and
new grass seed sown.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;In many sections, planting may now be done with
safety, provided the soil is light and dry, but not otherwise. Although
a tree or plant will receive no injury when its roots are undisturbed
in the soil should a frost come after planting, the same amount of
freezing will, and very often does, greatly injure the plant if the roots
are exposed.

Grapery.&mdash;The grapery started in January will have set its fruit,
which should be thinned by one-third. The temperature may now
be further advanced to 70° at night, with 15° higher in the daytime.
The same precautions must be used against mildew and insects as
given in January. Graperies wanted for succession may be started
in February or this month.

Vegetable Garden.&mdash;This is a busy month. In localities where
the frost is out of the ground, if it is not wet, seeds of the hardier
vegetables can be sown. The list of seeds given for the southern
states in January may now be used at the north, while for most of
the southern states tender vegetables, such as egg plant, okra, sweet
potatoes, melon, squash, potatoes, tomatoes, &amp;c., may be sown and
planted. Hotbeds must now be all started. In March flower seeds
and vegetable seeds may be sown in boxes or flats in the greenhouse,
or in residence windows, or near the kitchen stove. Unless one has
space under glass, or in hotbeds, in which the plants may be transplanted
before they are set in the open ground, it is well not to start
the seeds too early, inasmuch as the plants are likely to become too
large or to be pot-bound, or to become drawn.

April

Flower Garden and Greenhouse.&mdash;Window and greenhouse plants
require more water and ventilation. Due attention must be paid to
shifting well-rooted plants into larger pots; and, if space is desired,
many kinds of hardier plants can be safely put out in cold frames.
Towards the end of the month it may be necessary slightly to shade
the glass of the greenhouse. All herbaceous plants and hardy shrubs
may be planted in the garden. The covering of leaves or litter should
be taken off bulbs and tender plants that were covered up for winter,
so that the beds can be lightly forked and raked. Sow tender annual
flower seeds in boxes inside.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Strawberries that have been covered up with straw
or leaves should be relieved around the plants, leaving the covering
between them. Special care must be exercised that the mulch be
not left on too long; the plants should not become whitened or
&ldquo;drawn.&rdquo; Raspberries, grape vines, &amp;c., that have been laid down
may now be uncovered and tied up to stakes or trellises, and all new
781
plantations of these and other fruits may now be made. Fruit trees
may be grafted.

Vegetable Garden.&mdash;Asparagus, rhubarb, spinach, &amp;c., should be
uncovered., and the beds hoed or dug lightly. Hardier sorts of
vegetable seeds and plants, such as beets, cabbage, cauliflower,
celery, lettuce, onions, parsley, parsnips, peas, potatoes, radishes,
spinach, turnip, &amp;c., should all be sown or planted by the middle of
the month if the soil is dry and warm, and in all cases, where practicable,
before the end of the month. It is essential, in sowing seeds
now, that they be well firmed in the soil. Any who expect to get
early cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce or radishes, while planting or
sowing is delayed until the time of sowing tomato and egg plant in
May, are sure to be disappointed of a full crop. Frequent rotation of
crops should be practised in the vegetable garden, in order to head
off insects and diseases; and also to make the best use of the land.
Every three or four years the vegetable garden should be laid out in
some new place; but if this cannot be done, the crops should be
rotated on different parts of the old garden.

May

Flower Garden and Greenhouse.&mdash;Window and greenhouse plants
should be in their finest bloom. Firing may be entirely dispensed
with, though care must still be exercised in ventilating. If weather is
cold and backward, however, and in very northern regions, care must
be taken not to stop firing too soon, or the plants will mildew and
become stunted. Every precaution must be used to keep the air
moist. &ldquo;Moss culture&rdquo; may be tried, the common sphagnum or
moss of the swamps, mixed with one-twentieth of its bulk of bone-dust,
being laid as a mulch on the top of the earth of the flower-pots;
its effect is to shield the pots from the sun, and at the same time
stimulate the roots to come to the surface. By the end of the month
all of the plants that are wanted for the summer decoration of the
flower border may be planted out, first loosening a little the ball of
earth at the roots. If the weather is dry, water freely after planting.
When the greenhouse is not to be used during the summer months,
camellias, azaleas and plants of that character should be set out of
doors under partial shade; but most of the other plants usually
grown in the conservatory or window garden in winter may be set
in the open border. Flower-beds should be kept well hoed, and raked,
to prevent the growth of weeds next month.

Pelargoniums, pinks, monthly roses and all the half-hardy kinds of
flowering plants should be planted early, but coleus, heliotrope and
the more tender plants should be delayed until the end of the month.
Annuals that have been sown in the greenhouse or hotbed may be
planted out, and seeds of such sorts as mignonette, sweet alyssum,
Phlox Drummondii, portulaca, &amp;c., may be sown in the beds or
borders. The china aster is now one of the most popular of summer
and fall plants. The seed may be sown in the north as late as the
middle of May, or even the first of June, with good results for fall
blooming. If the plants are started early in the greenhouse, they are
likely to spend themselves before fall, and therefore a later sowing
should be provided.

Lawns should be mown, and the edgings trimmed.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;The hay or leaf mulching on the strawberry beds
should be removed and the ground deeply hoed (if not removed in
April in the more forward places), after which it may be placed on
again to keep the fruit clean and the ground from drying. Where it
has not been convenient before, most of the smaller fruits may yet
be planted during the first part of the month. Tobacco dust will
dislodge most of the numerous kinds of slugs, caterpillars or worms
that make their appearance on the young shoots of vines or trees.
Fruit trees may be planted this month, if they were not planted in
March or April. If they have been kept fresh and dormant, they
should still be in good condition. The broken roots should be cut
back to fresh wood, and the tops should be headed back in proportion.

Vegetable Garden.&mdash;Attention should be given to new sowings and
plantings for succession. Crops sown last month will have to be
thinned out if large enough. Hoe deeply all transplanted crops, such
as cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, &amp;c. Tender vegetables, such as
tomatoes, egg and pepper plants, sweet potatoes, &amp;c., can be planted
out. Seeds of Lima beans, sweet corn, melon, okra, cucumbers, &amp;c.,
should be sown; and sow for succession peas, spinach, lettuce, beans,
radishes, &amp;c., every ten days.

June

Flower Garden and Greenhouse.&mdash;Tropical plants can now be used
to fill up the greenhouse during the summer months. It should be
well shaded, and fine specimens of fancy caladiums, dracaenas,
coleus, crotons, palms, ferns and such plants as are grown for the
beauty of their foliage, will make a very attractive show. If these
cannot be had, common geraniums may be used. The &ldquo;moss
culture&rdquo; will be found particularly valuable for these plants. Hyacinths,
tulips and other spring bulbs may be dug up, dried and placed
away for next fall&rsquo;s planting, and their places filled with bedding
plants, such as coleus, achyranthes, pelargoniums, and the various
white and coloured leaf plants. It will be necessary to mow the lawn
once a week, and sometimes oftener.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;The small fruits should be mulched about the roots,
if this has not yet been done. If the fruit garden is large enough to
admit of horse culture, it is best to keep the bush-fruits well cultivated
during the season; this tillage conserves the moisture and helps to
make a full and plump crop of berries. In small areas the mulching
system is sometimes preferable.

Vegetable Garden.&mdash;Beets, beans, carrots, corn, cucumbers, lettuce,
peas and radishes may be sown for succession. This is usually a busy
month, as many crops have to be gathered, and, if hoeing is not
promptly seen to, weeds are certain to give great trouble. Tomatoes
should be tied up to trellises or stakes if fine-flavoured and handsome
fruit is desired, for if left to ripen on the ground they are apt to have
a gross earthy flavour.

July

Flower Garden and Greenhouse.&mdash;Watering, ventilating and fumigating
(or the use of tobacco in other forms for destruction of aphides)
must be attended to. The atmosphere of the greenhouse must be
kept moist. Watch the plants that have been plunged out of doors,
and see if any require repotting. All plants that require staking, such
as dahlias, roses, gladioli and many herbaceous plants, should now
be looked to. Carnations and other plants that are throwing up
flower stems, if wanted to flower in winter, should be cut back, that
is, the flower stems should be cut off to say 5 in. from the ground.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;If grape vines show any signs of mildew, dust
them over with dry sulphur, selecting a still warm day. The fruit
having now been gathered from strawberry plants, if new beds are to
be formed, the system of layering the plants in small pots is the best.
In general, field strawberries are not grown from potted layers, but
from good strong layers that strike naturally in the field. In the
north, spring planting of strawberries is generally advised for market
conditions; although planting in early fall or late summer is
successful when the ground is well prepared and when it does not
suffer from drought. Where apples, pears, peaches, grapes, &amp;c., have
set fruit thickly, thin out at least one-half to two-thirds of the young
fruit.

Vegetable Garden.&mdash;The first ten days of this month will yet be
time enough to sow sweet corn, beets, lettuce, beans, cucumbers and
ruta-baga turnips. Such vegetables as cabbage, cauliflower, celery,
&amp;c., wanted for fall or winter use, are best planted this month, though
in some sections they will do later. Keep sweet potatoes hoed to
prevent the vines rooting at the joints.

August

Flower Garden and Greenhouse.&mdash;But little deviation is required in
these departments from the instructions for July. See that sufficient
water is applied; the walks may be wet in the houses.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Strawberries that have fruited will now be making
&ldquo;runners,&rdquo; or young plants. These should be kept cut off close to the
old plant, so that the full force of the root is expended in making the
&ldquo;crowns&rdquo; or fruit buds for next season&rsquo;s crop. If plants are required
for new beds, only the required number should be allowed to
grow, and these may be layered in pots as recommended in July.
The old stems of raspberries and blackberries that have borne fruit
should be cut away, and the young shoots thinned to three or four
canes to each hill or plant. If tied to stakes and topped when 4 or
5 ft. high, they will form three or four branches on a cane, and will
make stronger fruiting plants for next year.

Vegetable Garden.&mdash;Hoe deeply such crops as cabbage, cauliflower
and celery. The earthing up of celery this month is not to be
recommended, unless a little very early supply is wanted. Onions in
many sections can be harvested. The proper condition is when the
tops are turning yellow and falling down. They are dried best by
placing them in a dry shed in thin layers. Sow spinach for fall use,
but not yet for the winter crop. Red top, white globe, and yellow
Aberdeen turnips should now be sown; ruta-baga turnips sown last
month will need thinning, and in extreme southern states they may
yet be sown.

September

Flower Garden and Greenhouse.&mdash;The flower-beds in the lawn should
be at their best. If planted in &ldquo;ribbon lines&rdquo; or &ldquo;massing,&rdquo; strict
attention must be given to pinching off the tops, so that the lines or
masses will present an even surface. Tender plants will require to
be put in the greenhouse or housed in some way towards the end of
this month; but be careful to keep them as cool as possible during
the day. Cuttings of bedding plants may now be made freely if
wanted for next season, as young cuttings rooted in the fall make
better plants for next spring&rsquo;s use than old plants, in the case of such
soft-wooded plants as pelargoniums, fuchsias, verbenas, heliotropes,
&amp;c.; with roses and plants of a woody nature, however, the old
plants usually do best. Dutch bulbs, such as hyacinths, tulips,
crocus, &amp;c., and most of the varieties of lilies, may be planted.
Violets that are wanted for winter flowering will now be growing
freely, and the runners should be trimmed off. Sow seeds of sweet
alyssum, candytuft, daisies, mignonette, pansies, &amp;c. Visit the
roadsides and woods for interesting plants to put in the hardy
borders.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Strawberry plants that have been layered in pots
may yet be planted, or in southern districts the ordinary ground
layers may be planted. The sooner in the month both are planted
the better crop they will give next season; and, as these plants soon
782
make runners, it will be necessary to trim them off. Attend to raspberries
and blackberries as advised for last month, if they have
not already been attended to. All fruit trees should be gone over for
borers before cold weather sets in; they also should have been gone
over for the same purpose in May and June.

Vegetable Garden.&mdash;If cabbage, cauliflower and lettuce are wanted
to plant in cold frames, the seed should be sown from about the 10th
to the 20th of this month; but judgment should be exercised,
for, if sown too early, cabbage and cauliflower are apt to run to seed.
The best date for latitude of New York is September 15th. The
main crop of spinach or sprouts that is wanted for winter or spring
use should be sown about the same date. The earth should be drawn
up to celery with a hoe preparatory to earthing up with a spade.
Onions that were not harvested and dried last month must now be
attended to. Turnips of the early or flat sorts may yet be sown the
first week of this month in the northern states, and in the south
from two to four weeks later.

October

Flower Garden and Greenhouse.&mdash;In northern sections of the United
States, tender plants that are still outside should be got under cover
as early as possible. Delay using fire heat as long as possible, unless
the nights become so cold as to chill the plants inside the house.
Roses, carnations, camellias, azaleas, pelargoniums and the hardier
sorts of plants will do better if placed in a cold frame or pit until the
middle of November than they would in an ordinary greenhouse.
Look out for insects. Fall bulbs of all kinds may be planted. Take
up summer-flowering bulbs and tubers, such as dahlias, tuberoses,
gladioli, cannas, caladiums, tigridias, and dry them off thoroughly,
stowing them away afterwards in some place free from frost and
moisture during the winter. Before winter sets in see that the lawn
is freely top-dressed. Be careful not to mow the grass too short in
fall.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Strawberries that have been grown from pot-grown
layers may yet be planted in southern states; keep the runners
trimmed off. Fruit trees and shrubs may be set out; but, if planting
is deferred to the last of the month, the ground around the roots
should be mulched to the thickness of 3 or 4 in. with straw, leaves or
rough manure, as a protection against frost. The fruit garden must
be protected from the ravages of mice in winter. Mice will nest about
the plants if there is straw or other litter around them. Before
winter, all tall grass and loose litter should be taken away; if this is
not done, then the first snow should be tramped heavily around the
plants, in order to destroy any nesting-places.

Vegetable Garden.&mdash;Celery will now be in full growth, and will
require close attention to earthing up, and during the last part of the
month the first lot may be stored away in trenches for winter. All
vegetable roots not designed to be left in the ground during the
winter should be dug up, such as beets, carrots, parsnips, sweet
potatoes, &amp;c. The cabbage, cauliflower and lettuce plants grown
from seed sown last month should be pricked out in cold frames. If
lettuce is wanted for winter use, it may now be planted in the greenhouse
or cold frame, and will be ready for use about Christmas. If
asparagus or rhubarb is wanted for winter use, it should be taken
up and stowed away in pit, frame, shed or cellar for a month or
two. It may then be taken into the greenhouse and packed closely
together under the stage, and will be fit for use from January to
March, according to the temperature of the house. Vegetable
gardens often become infested with diseases that are carried over
from year to year in the old plants and litter; this is specially true
of water-melons and of some diseases of tomatoes. It is well, therefore,
to burn the tops of the plants in the fall, rather than to plough
them under or to throw them on the compost heap.

November

Flower Garden and Greenhouse.&mdash;Plants intended to be grown
inside should now all be indoors. Keep a sharp look-out for cold
snaps, as they come very unexpectedly in November, and many
plants are lost thereby. In cases where it is not convenient to use
fire heat, 5° to 10° of cold can be resisted by covering the plants over
with paper, and by using this before frost has struck the plants
valuable collections may be saved. When fire heat is freely used, be
careful to keep up the proper amount of moisture by sprinkling the
paths with water. Little can be done in the flower garden, except to
clean off all dead stalks, and straw up tender roses, vines, &amp;c., and,
wherever there is time, to dig up and rake the borders, as it will
greatly facilitate spring work. Cover up all beds in which there are
hyacinths, tulips and other bulbs with a litter of leaves or straw to
the depth of 2 or 3 in. If short, thoroughly-decayed manure can
be spared, a good sprinkling spread over the lawn will help it to a
finer growth next spring.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;Strawberry beds should be covered (in cold sections)
with hay, straw or leaf mulching, to a depth not exceeding 2 in.
Fruit trees and grape vines generally should be pruned; and, if the
wood of the vine is wanted for cuttings, or scions of fruit trees for
grafts, they should be tied in small bundles and buried in the ground
until spring. They may be taken in December or January if preferred.

Vegetable Garden.&mdash;Celery that is to be stored for winter use should
be put away before the end of the month in all sections north of
Virginia; south of that it may be left in most places where grown
throughout the winter if well covered up. The stalks of the asparagus
bed should be cut off, and burned if there are berries on them, as the
seeds scattered in the soil sometimes produce troublesome weeds.
Mulch the beds with 2 or 3 in. of rough manure. All vegetable roots
that are yet in the ground, and not designed to be left there over
winter, must be dug up in this latitude before the middle of the
month or they may be frozen in. Cover up onions, spinach, sprouts,
cabbage or lettuce plants with a covering of 2 or 3 in. of leaves, hay,
or straw, to protect them during the winter. Cabbages that have
headed may usually be preserved against injury by frost until the
middle of next month, by simply pulling them up and packing them
closely in a dry spot in the open field with the heads down and roots
up. On approach of cold weather in December they should be covered
up with leaves as high as the tops of the roots, or, if the soil is light,
it may be thrown over them, if leaves are not convenient. Cabbages
will keep this way until March if the covering has not been put on
too early. Plough all empty ground if practicable, and, whenever
time will permit, do trenching and subsoiling. Cabbage, cauliflower
and lettuce plants that are in frames should be regularly
ventilated by lifting the sash on warm days, and on the approach
of very cold weather they should be covered with straw mats or
shutters. In the colder latitudes, and even in the middle states, it
is absolutely necessary to protect cauliflower in this way, as it is much
more tender than cabbage and lettuce plants.

December

Flower Garden and Greenhouse.&mdash;Close attention must be paid to
protecting all tender plants, for it is not uncommon to have the care
of a whole year spoiled by one night&rsquo;s neglect. Vigilance and extra
hot fires will have to be kept up when the thermometer falls to 34°
or 35° in the parlour or conservatory. It is well to set the plants
under the benches or on the walks of the greenhouses; if they are in
the parlour move them away from the cold point and protect them
with paper; this will usually save them even if the thermometer
falls to 24° or 26°. Another plan in the greenhouse is to dash water
on the pipes or flues, which causes steam to rise to the glass and
freeze there, stopping up all the crevices. With plants outside that
require strawing up or to be mulched, this will have now to be
finished.

Fruit Garden.&mdash;In sections where it is an advantage to protect
grape vines, raspberries, &amp;c., from severe frost, these should be laid
down as close to the ground as possible, and covered with leaves,
straw or hay, or with a few inches of soil. Grapes may be pruned.
Fruit trees may be pruned from now till March in the north.

Vegetable Garden.&mdash;Celery in trenches should receive the final
covering for the winter, which is best done by leaves or light stable
litter; in the latitude of New York it should not be less than 12 in.
thick. Potatoes, beets, turnips or other roots in pits, the spinach
crop in the ground, or any other article in need of protection, should
be attended to before the end of the month; manure and compost
heaps should be forwarded as rapidly as possible, and turned and
mixed so as to be in proper condition for spring. Remove the snow
that accumulates on cold frames or other glass structures, particularly
if the soil which the glass covers was not frozen before the snow
fell; it may remain on the sashes longer if the plants are frozen in,
since they are dormant, and would not be injured if deprived of light
for eight or ten days. If roots have been placed in cellars, attention
must be given to ventilation, which can be done by making a wooden
box, say 6 by 8 in., to run from the ceiling of the cellar to the eaves
of the building above.

HORTON, CHRISTIANA (c. 1696-c. 1756), English actress,
first appeared in London as Melinda in The Recruiting Officer
in 1714 at Drury Lane. Here she remained twenty years,
followed by fifteen at Covent Garden. At both houses during
this long career she played all the leading tragedy and comedy
parts, and Barton Booth (who &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; her) said she was
the best successor of Mrs. Oldfield. She was the original Mariana
in Fielding&rsquo;s Miser (1733).



HORTON, ROBERT FORMAN (1855-&emsp;&emsp;), British Nonconformist
divine, was born in London on the 18th of September
1855. He was educated at Shrewsbury school and New College,
Oxford, where he took first classes in classics. He was president
of the Oxford Union in 1877. He became a fellow of his college
in 1879, and lectured on history for four years. In 1880 he
accepted an influential invitation to become pastor of the Lyndhurst
Road Congregational church, Hampstead, and subsequently
took a very prominent part in church and denominational
work generally. He delivered the Lyman Beecher
lectures at Yale in 1893; in 1898 he was chairman of the London
Congregational Union; and in 1903 of the Congregational Union of
England and Wales. In 1909 he took a prominent part in the
75th anniversary celebration of Hartford Theological Seminary.
His numerous publications include books on theological, critical,
historical, biographical and devotional subjects.



HORTON, SAMUEL DANA (1844-1895), American writer
on bimetallism, was born in Pomeroy, Ohio, on the 16th of
January 1844. He graduated at Harvard in 1864, and at the
Harvard Law School in 1868, studied Roman law in Berlin in
1869, and in 1871 was admitted to the Ohio bar. He practised
law in Cincinnati, and then in Pomeroy until 1885, when he gave
up law for the advancement of bimetallism. His attention had
been turned to monetary questions by the &ldquo;greenback campaign&rdquo;
of 1875 in Ohio, in which, as in former campaigns, he
had spoken, particularly effectively in German, for the Republican
party. He was secretary of the American delegation to the
Monetary Conference which met in Paris in 1878, and edited
the report of the delegation. To the conference of 1881 he was
a delegate, and thereafter he spent much of his time in Europe,
whither he was sent by President Harrison in 1889 as special
commissioner to promote the international restoration of silver.
He died in Washington, D.C., on the 23rd of February 1895.
Horton&rsquo;s principal works were The Silver Pound (1887) and
Silver in Europe (1890), a volume of essays.



HORUS (Egyptian H&#333;r), the name of an Egyptian god,
if not of several distinct gods. To all forms of Horus the falcon
was sacred; the name H&#333;r, written with a standing figure of that
bird,  is connected with a root signifying &ldquo;upper,&rdquo; and
probably means &ldquo;the high-flyer.&rdquo; The tame sacred falcon on
its perch  is the commonest symbol of divinity in early
hieroglyphic writing; the commonest title of the king in the
earliest dynasties, and his first title later, was that which named
him Horus. Hawk gods were the presiding deities of Poi (Pe)
and Nekhen, which had been the royal quarters in the capitals
of the two primeval kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt, at Buto
and opposite El Kab. A principal festival in very early times
was the &ldquo;worship of Horus,&rdquo; and the kings of the prehistoric
dynasties were afterwards called &ldquo;the worshippers of Horus.&rdquo;
The Northern Kingdom in particular was under the patronage
of Horus. He was a solar divinity, but appears very early in
the Osiris cycle of deities, a son of Isis and probably of Osiris,
and opponent of S&#275;th. On monuments of the Middle Kingdom
or somewhat later we find besides H&#333;r the following special
forms: Har-behtet, i.e. H&#333;r of Beht, the winged solar disk,
god of Edfu (Apollinopolis Magna); Har-khentekthai, god of
Athribis; Har-mesen (whose principal sacred animal was a
lion), god of the Sethroite (?) nome; Har-khentemna, i.e. the
blind (?) Horus (with a shrew-mouse) at Letopolis; Har-mert
(&ldquo;of two eyes&rdquo;) at Pharbaethus; Har-akht, Ra-har-akht, or
Har-m-akhi (Harikakhis, &ldquo;Hor of the horizon&rdquo;), the sun-god
of Heliopolis.

As a sun-god Horus not only worsted the hostile darkness and
avenged his father, but also daily renewed himself. He was thus
identical with his own father from one point of view. In the
mythology, especially that of the New Kingdom, or of quite late
times, we find the following standing epithets applied to more or
less distinct forms or phases: Harendotes (Har-ent-yotf),
i.e. &ldquo;H&#333;r, avenger of his father (Osiris)&rdquo;; Harpokhrates
(Har-p-khrat), i.e. &ldquo;H&#333;r the child,&rdquo; with finger in mouth,
sometimes seated on a lotus-flower; Harsiesis (Har-si-&#274;si),
i.e. &ldquo;H&#333;r, son of Isis,&rdquo; as a child; Har-en-kh&#275;bi, &ldquo;H&#333;r in
Chemmis,&rdquo; a child nursed by Isis in the papyrus marshes;
Haroeris (Har-u&#275;r), i.e. &ldquo;the elder H&#333;r,&rdquo; at Ombos, &amp;c., human-headed
or falcon-headed; Harsemteus (Har-sem-teu), i.e.
&ldquo;H&#333;r, uniter of the two lands,&rdquo; and others.

In the judgment scene Horus introduces the deceased to Osiris.
To the Greeks Horus was equivalent to Apollo, but in the name
of Hermopolis Parva (see Damanhur), which must have been
among the first of the Egyptian cities to be known to them, he
was apparently identified with Hermes. Although the falcon
was the bird most properly sacred to Horus, not only its varieties,
but also the sparrow-hawk, kestrel and other small hawks were
mummified in his honour in late times.

HORWICH, an urban district in the Westhoughton parliamentary
division of Lancashire, England, 4 m. W.N.W. of
Bolton, on the Lancashire and Yorkshire railway. Pop. (1901)
15,084. It lies beneath the considerable elevation of Rivington
Pike, where formerly was a great forest. It has extensive
locomotive works, and there are large stone quarries in the
district. Bleaching and cotton-spinning and the manufacture
of fire-bricks and tiles are carried on.



HOSANNA, the cry of praise or adoration shouted in recognition
of the Messiahship of Jesus on his entry into Jerusalem
(Matt. xxi. 9, 15; Mark xi. 9 sq.; John xii. 13), and since used
in the Christian Church. It is also a Jewish liturgical term,
and was applied specifically to the &ldquo;hosanna&rdquo; branches carried
in procession in the Feast of Booths or Tabernacles, the seventh
day of which was called the Hosanna-day (so also in Syrian
usage; cf. &ldquo;Palm&rdquo; Sunday). This festival (for which see Lev.
xxiii. 39 sqq.; 2 Macc. x. 7; Jos. Ant. xii. 10. 4, xiii. 13. 15; and
the Talmudic tractate Sukkah) already suggested a Dionysiac
celebration to Plutarch (Symp. iv. 6), and was associated with
a ceremonial drawing of water which, it was believed, secured
fertilizing rains in the following year; the penalty for abstinence
was drought (cf. Zech. xiv. 16 seq.). The evidence (see further
Ency. Bib. cols. 3354, 4880 seq.; I. Levy, Rev. des Ét. juives,
1901, pp. 192 sqq.) points to rites of nature-worship, and it
is possible that in these the term Hosanna had some other
application.


The old interpretation &ldquo;save, now!&rdquo; which may be a popular
etymology, is based on Ps. cxviii. 25 (Heb. h&#333;sh&#299;&lsquo;ah-nn&#257;), but this
does not explain the occurrence of the word in the Gospels, a complicated
problem, on which see the articles of J. H. Thayer in Hastings&rsquo;s
Dict. Bib., and more especially T. K. Cheyne, Ency. Bib. s.v.




HOSE (a word common to many Teutonic languages; cf.
Dutch, hoos, stocking, Ger. Hose, breeches, tights; the
ultimate origin is unknown), the name of an article of dress,
784
used as a covering for the leg and foot. The word has been
used for various forms of a long stocking covering both the foot
and leg (see Hosiery), and this is the usual modern sense. But
it also formerly meant a kind of gaiter covering the leg from the
knee to the ankle only, of the long tight covering for the whole
of the lower limbs, and later of the short puffed or slashed
breeches worn with the doublet&mdash;at this period, from the early
part of the 16th century onwards, comes the distinction between
the &ldquo;hose&rdquo; or &ldquo;trunk hose&rdquo; and the stocking (see Costume).
The term is applied to certain objects resembling such a covering,
as in its application to flexible rubber or canvas piping used
for conveying water (see Hosepipe), and in botany, to the
&ldquo;sheath&rdquo; covering, e.g. the ear of corn. The term &ldquo;hose-in-hose&rdquo;
is thus used in botany for a flower in which the corolla
has become doubled, as though a second were inserted in the
throat of the first; it occurs sometimes in the primrose.



HOSEA, the son of Be&#275;r&#299;, the first in order of the minor
prophets of the Old Testament. The name Hosea (&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1506;, LXX.
&#8040;&#963;&#951;&#941;, Vulg. Osee, and so the English version in Rom. ix. 25)
ought rather to be written Hoshea, and is identical with that
borne by the last king of Ephraim, and by Joshua in Num.
xiii. 16, Deut. xxxii. 44. Of the life of Hosea1 we know nothing
beyond what can be gathered from his prophecies. That he
was a citizen of the northern kingdom appears from the whole
tenor of the book, but most expressly from i. 2, where &ldquo;the
land,&rdquo; the prophet&rsquo;s land, is the realm of Israel, and vii. 5,
where &ldquo;our king&rdquo; is the king of Samaria. The date at which
Hosea flourished is given in the title, i. 1, by the reigning kings
of Judah and Israel. He prophesied (i) in the days of Uzziah,
Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah; (2) in the days
of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. The dates indicated
by the title, which may be regarded as editorial, are,
for the four kings of the southern kingdom, 789-740, 739-734,
733-721 and 720-693 B.C. respectively; and, for Jeroboam II.,
782-743 (cf. Ency. Bib. col. 797-798). The book itself, however,
plainly belongs to the period prior to 734 B.C. since, in that
year, (a) the Syro-Ephraimitic war began, to which there is
here no reference, nor is Assyria yet the open foe it then became;
(b) Gilead became Tiglath-Pileser&rsquo;s (2 Kings xv. 29), whereas
it is here described as still part of the territory of Israel (vi. 8;
xii. 11; cf. the included place-names of v. 1). On the other hand,
the prophet connects with the birth of his eldest child the
approaching fall of the house of Jehu (i. 4), thus anticipating
the death of Jeroboam II. in 743, and the period of anarchy
which followed (2 Kings xv.). Thus the prophetic work of
Hosea may be dated, with practical certainty, as beginning
from some point previous to 743 and extending not later than
734.2 This is corroborated by the general character of the
book. Of its two parts, i.-iii. reflects the wealth and prosperity
of the reign of Jeroboam II., whilst iv.-xiv. contains frequent references
to the social disorder and anarchy of the subsequent years.

The first part of Hosea&rsquo;s prophetic work, corresponding to
chs. i.-iii., lay in the years of external prosperity immediately
preceding the catastrophe of the house of Jehu in or near the year
743. The second part of the book is a summary of prophetic
teaching during the subsequent troublous reign of Menahem,
and, perhaps, that of his successor, Pekahiah, and must have
been completed before 734 B.C. Apart from the narrative
in chs. i.-iii., to which we shall presently recur, the book throws
little or no light on the details of Hosea&rsquo;s life. It appears from
ix. 7, 8, that his prophetic work was greatly embarrassed by
opposition: &ldquo;As for the prophet, a fowler&rsquo;s snare is in all his
ways, and enmity in the house of his God.&rdquo; The enmity which
had its centre in the sanctuary probably proceeded from the
priests (comp. Amos vii.), against whose profligacy and profanation
of their office our prophet frequently declaims&mdash;perhaps
also from the degenerate prophetic gilds which had their seats
in the holy cities of the northern kingdom, and with whom
Hosea&rsquo;s elder contemporary Amos so indignantly refuses to
be identified (Amos vii. 14). In ch. iv. 5 Hosea seems to
comprise priests and prophets in one condemnation, thus placing
himself in direct antagonism to all the leaders of the religious
life of his nation. He is not less antagonistic to the kings and
princes of his day (vii. 3-7, viii. 4, viii. 10 Septuagint, x. 7-15,
xiii. 11).3 In view of the familiarity shown with the intrigues
of rulers and the doings of priests, it has been conjectured that
Hosea held a prominent position, or even (by Duhm) that he
was himself a priest (Marti, p. 2).

The most interesting problem of Hosea&rsquo;s history lies in the
interpretation of the story of his married life (chs. i.-iii.). We
read in these chapters that God&rsquo;s revelation to Hosea began
when in accordance with a divine command he married a profligate
wife, Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim. Three children were born
in this marriage and received symbolical names, illustrative of
the divine purpose towards Israel, which are expounded in ch.
i. In ch. ii. the faithlessness of Israel to Jehovah (Yahweh),
the long-suffering of God, the moral discipline of sorrow and
tribulation by which He will yet bring back His erring people
and betroth it to Himself for ever in righteousness, love and
truth, are depicted under the figure of the relation of a husband
to an erring spouse. The suggestion of this allegory lies in
the prophet&rsquo;s marriage with Gomer, but the details are worked
out quite independently, and under a rich multiplicity of figures
derived from other sources. In the third chapter we return
to the personal experience of the prophet. His faithless wife
had at length left him and fallen, under circumstances which are
not detailed, into a state of misery, from which Hosea, still
following her with tender affection, and encouraged by a divine
command, brought her back and restored her to his house,
where he kept her in seclusion, and patiently watched over
her for many days, yet not readmitting her to the privileges
of a wife.

In these experiences the prophet again recognizes a parallel
to Yahweh&rsquo;s long-suffering love to Israel, and the discipline
by which the people shall be brought back to God through a
period in which all their political and religious institutions are
overthrown. Throughout these chapters personal narrative
and prophetic allegory are interwoven with a rapidity of transition
very puzzling to the modern reader; but an unbiassed
exegesis can hardly fail to acknowledge that chs. i. and iii.
narrate an actual passage in the prophet&rsquo;s life. The names of the
three children are symbolical, but Isaiah in like manner gave
symbolical names to his sons, embodying prominent points
785
in his prophetic teaching (Shear-jashub, Isa. vii. 3, comp. x. 21;
Maher-shalal-hash-baz, viii. 3). And the name of Gomer bath
Diblaim is certainly that of an actual person, upon which all
the allegorists, from the Targum, Jerome and Ephraem Syrus
downwards, have spent their arts in vain, whereas the true symbolical
names in the book are perfectly easy of interpretation.4
That the ancient interpreters take the whole narrative as a mere
parable is no more than an application of their standing rule that
everything in the Biblical history is allegorical which in its literal
sense appears offensive to propriety (comp. Jerome&rsquo;s proem to
the book). But the supposed offence to propriety seems to rest
on mistaken exegesis and too narrow a conception of the way
in which the Divine word was communicated to the prophets.5
There is no reason to suppose that Hosea knowingly married
a woman of profligate character. The point of the allegory
in i. 2 is plainly infidelity after marriage as a parallel to Israel&rsquo;s
departure from the covenant God, and a profligate wife (&#1488;&#1513;&#1514; &#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;)
is not the same thing with an open prostitute (&#1494;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;). The
marriage was marred by Gomer&rsquo;s infidelity; and the struggle
of Hosea&rsquo;s affection for his wife with this great unhappiness&mdash;a
struggle inconceivable unless his first love had been pure and
full of trust in the purity of its object&mdash;furnished him with a new
insight into Yahweh&rsquo;s dealings with Israel. Then he recognized
that the great calamity of his life was God&rsquo;s own ordinance and
appointed means to communicate to him a deep prophetic lesson.
The recognition of a divine command after the fact has its
parallel, as Wellhausen observes, in Jer. xxxii. 8.

It was in the experiences of his married life, and in the spiritual
lessons opened to him through these, that Hosea first heard
the revealing voice of Yahweh (i. 2).6 Like Amos (Amos iii. 8),
he was called to speak for God by an inward constraining voice,
and there is no reason to think that he had any connexion with
the recognized prophetic societies, or ever received such outward
adoption to office as was given to Elisha. His position in Israel
was one of tragic isolation. Amos, when he had discharged his
mission at Bethel, could return to his home and to his friends;
Hosea was a stranger among his own people, and his home was
full of sorrow and shame. Isaiah in the gloomiest days of Judah&rsquo;s
declensions had faithful disciples about him, and knew that there
was a believing remnant in the land. Hosea knows no such
remnant, and there is not a line in his prophecy from which
we can conclude that his words ever found an obedient ear.

As already stated, this prophecy falls into two clearly distinguished
sections,7 the former (i.-iii.), already dealt with,
accounting for the general standpoint of the latter (iv.-xiv.).
It is not possible to make any convincing subdivisions of this
latter section (cf. G. A. Smith, i. p. 223) which is best regarded
as a series of separate discourses on certain recurrent topics,
viz. (a) the cultus, (b) the social disorder and immorality, (c)
political tendencies (alliance with either Assyria or Egypt sought).8
In regard to each of these topics, the attitude of the prophet
involves the discernment of present guilt, and the assertion
of future punishment. For him the present condition of the
people contained no germ or pledge of future amendment, and
he describes the impending judgment, not as a sifting process
(Amos ix. 9, 10) in which the wicked perish and the righteous
remain, but as the total wreck of the nation which has wholly
turned aside from its God. In truth, while the idolatrous feasts of
Ephraim still ran their joyous round, while the careless people
crowded to the high places, and there in unbridled and licentious
mirth flattered themselves that their many sacrifices ensured the
help of their God against all calamity, the nation was already
in the last stage of internal dissolution. To the prophet&rsquo;s eye
there was &ldquo;no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the
land&mdash;nought but swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing
and adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood&rdquo;
(iv. 1, 2). The root of this corruption lay in total ignorance of
Yahweh, whose precepts were no longer taught by the priests,
while in the national calf-worship, and in the local high places,
this worship was confounded with the service of the Canaanite
Baalim. Thus the whole religious constitution of Israel was
undermined. And the political state of the realm was in Hosea&rsquo;s
eyes not more hopeful. The dynasty of Jehu, still great and
powerful when the prophet&rsquo;s labours began, is itself an incorporation
of national sin. Founded on the bloodshed of Jezreel, it
must fall by God&rsquo;s vengeance, and the state shall fall with it
(i. 4, iii. 4). This sentence stands at the head of Hosea&rsquo;s predictions,
and throughout the book the civil constitution of
Ephraim is represented as equally lawless and godless with the
corrupt religious establishment. The anarchy that followed
on the murder of Zachariah appears to the prophet as the natural
decadence of a realm not founded on divine ordinance. The
nation had rejected Yahweh, the only helper. And now the
avenging Assyrian9 is at hand. Samaria&rsquo;s king shall pass away
as foam on the water. Fortress and city shall fall before the
ruthless invader, who spares neither age nor sex, and thistles shall
cover the desolate altars of Ephraim.


In our present book of Hosea, this condemnatory judgment on
contemporary Israel culminates in a chapter of appeal for penitence,
with promise of divine forgiveness. The question of the authenticity
of this and of other &ldquo;restoration&rdquo; passages10 forms the chief problem
786
for literary criticism presented by the book.11 Amongst the more
recent commentators, Davidson, G. A. Smith and Nowack regard
Hosea xiv. as written by the prophet, though the second admits
its chronological misplacement and the third its later expansion.
On the other hand, it is altogether rejected by Cheyne, Wellhausen,
Marti and Harper. These claim that the passage reflects the later
standpoint of completed punishment, and is therefore inconsistent
in the prophet who anticipates that punishment. But the case is
different from that of the epilogue to Amos, since Hosea&rsquo;s personal
experience covers forgiveness as well as discipline (Marti consistently,
though without ground, rejects this experience also). There seems,
therefore, to be no sufficient evidence for denying thoughts of
restoration to Hosea, whilst it is highly probable that such passages
would be amplified in a later age. Indeed, the importance of these
passages for the interpretation of Hosea is apt to be overrated,
for, as one of those rejecting them remarks, though Hosea &ldquo;promised
nothing,&rdquo; yet he &ldquo;contributed a conception of Yahweh which made
such a future not only possible but even probable&rdquo; (Harper, p. cliii.).
We may therefore read the closing chapter as, at least, the explicit
statement of a hope implicit in Hosea&rsquo;s teaching.


Hosea could discern no faithful remnant in Ephraim, yet
Ephraim in all his corruption is the son of Yahweh, a child
nurtured with tender love, a chosen people, whose past history
declares in every episode the watchful and patient affection
of his father. And that father is God and not man, the Holy
One who will not and cannot sacrifice His love even to the justest
indignation (chap. xi.). To the prophet who knows this love of
Yahweh, who has learned to understand it in the like experience
of his own life, the very ruin of the state of Israel is a step in the
loving guidance which makes the valley of trouble a door of hope
(ii. 15), and the wilderness of tribulation as full of promise as
the desert road from Egypt to Canaan was to Israel of old. Of the
manner of Israel&rsquo;s repentance and conversion Hosea presents no
clear image&mdash;nay, it is plain that on this point he had nothing to
tell. The certainty that the people will at length return and
seek Yahweh their God rests, not on any germ of better things
in Israel, but on the invincible supremacy of Yahweh&rsquo;s love.
And so the two sides of his prophetic declaration, the passionate
denunciation of Israel&rsquo;s sin and folly, and the not less passionate
tenderness with which he describes the final victory of divine
love, are united by no logical bond. The unity is one of feeling
only, and the sob of anguish in which many of his appeals to a
heedless people seem to end turns once and again with sudden
revulsion into the clear accents of evangelical promise, which in
the closing chapter swell forth in pure and strong cadence out
of a heart that has found its rest with God from all the troubles
of a stormy life.

The strongly emotional temperament of Hosea suggests comparison
with that of Jeremiah, who like himself is the prophet
of the decline and fall of a kingdom. The subsequent influence
of Hosea on the literature of the Old and New Testaments is
very marked. Not only is it seen in the conception of the
relation between God and His people as a marriage, which
he makes current coin (cf. Marti, p. 15), but still more in the
fact that his conception of the divine character becomes the
inspiration of the book of Deuteronomy and so of the whole
canon of Scripture. &ldquo;In a special degree, the author of
Deuteronomy is the spiritual heir of Hosea.&rdquo;12

1 Traditions about Hosea.&mdash;Be&#275;r&#299;, the prophet&rsquo;s father, is identified
by the Rabbins with Be&#275;rah (1 Chron. v. 6), a Reubenite prince
carried captive by Tiglath-Pileser. This view is already expressed
by Jerome, Quaest. in Paralip., and doubtless underlies the statement
of the Targum to Chronicles that Be&#275;rah was a prophet. For
it is a Jewish maxim that when a prophet&rsquo;s father is named, he, too,
was a prophet, and accordingly a tradition of R. Simon makes
Isa. viii. 19, 20 a prophecy of Be&#275;r&#299; (&#7730;imc&#7717;i in loc.; Leviticus
Rabba, par. 15). According to the usual Christian tradition, however,
Hosea was of the tribe of Issachar, and from an unknown town,
Belemoth or Belemon (pseudo-Epiphanius, pseudo-Dorotheus,
Ephraem Syr. ii. 234; Chron. Pasch., Bonn ed., i. 276). As the
tradition adds that he died there, and was buried in peace, the
source of the story lies probably in some holy place shown as his
grave. There are other traditions as to the burial-place of Hosea.
A Jewish legend in the Shalshelet haqqabala (Carpzov, Introd., pt. iii.
ch. vii. § 3) tells that he died in captivity at Babylon, and was
carried to Upper Galilee, and buried at &#1510;&#1508;&#1514;, that is, Safed (Neubauer,
Géog. du Talmud, p. 227); and the Arabs show the grave of Nebi
&rsquo;Osha, east of the Jordan, near Es-Salt (Baedeker&rsquo;s Palestine, p. 337;
Burckhardt&rsquo;s Syria, p. 353).

2 The supposed reference of viii. 9-10 to the tribute paid by
Menahem to Tiglath-Pileser (2 Kings xv. 19), and dated, on the
monuments, 738 B.C., depends on a corrupt text: read v. 10 with
Septuagint.

3 Some scholars hold that his attack is directed against the very
principle of monarchy (Nowack, p. 8; Smend, p. 209: &ldquo;Hosea
rejects the kingship in itself&rdquo;; Wellhausen, p. 125: &ldquo;The making
of kings in Israel is for him, together with the heathen cultus, the
fundamental evil&rdquo;). This view depends on a disputed interpretation
of the reference to Gibeah (x. 9; cf. ix. 9); and on the words:
&ldquo;I give thee kings in mine anger, and I take them away in my
wrath&rdquo; (xiii. 11), which may refer to the rise and fall of contemporary
kings (cf. Marti, ad loc). In any case, as Wellhausen himself
says (p. 132): &ldquo;He does not start from a dogmatic theory, but
simply from historical experience.&rdquo;

4 Theodorus Mops. remarks very justly, <span class="grk" title="kai to onoma kai ton patera

5 This explanation of the narrative, which is essentially Ewald&rsquo;s,
is now generally accepted. It has the great advantage of supplying
a psychological key to the conception of Israel or the land of Israel
(i. 2) as the spouse of Yahweh, which dominates these chapters,
but in the later part of the book gives way to the personification of
the nation as God&rsquo;s son. This conception has, indeed, formal points
of contact with notions previously current, and even with the ideas
of Semitic heathenism. On the one hand, it is a standing Hebrew
usage to represent the land as mother of its people, while the representation
of worshippers as children of their god is found in Num.
xxi. 29, where the Moabites are called children of Chemosh, and is
early and widespread throughout the Semitic field (cf. Trans. Bib.
Arch. vi. 438; Jour. of Phil. ix. 82). The combination of these
two notions gives at once the conception of the national deity as
husband of the land. On the other hand, the designation of Yahweh
as Baal, which, in accordance with the antique view of marriage,
means husband as well as lord and owner, was current among the
Israelites in early times, perhaps, indeed, down to Hosea&rsquo;s age
(ii. 16). Now it is highly probable that among the idolatrous
Israelites the idea of a marriage between the deity and individual
worshippers was actually current and connected with the immorality
which Hosea often condemns in the worship of the local Baalim
whom the ignorant people identified with Yahweh. For we have
a Punic woman&rsquo;s name, &#1488;&#1512;&#1513;&#1514;&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;, &ldquo;the betrothed of Baal&rdquo; (Euting,
Punische Steine, pp. 9, 15), and a similar conception existed among
the Babylonians (Herod. i. 181, 182). But Hosea takes the idea of
Yahweh as husband, and gives it an altogether different turn,
filling it with a new and profound meaning, based on the psychical
experiences of a deep human affection in contest with outraged
honour and the wilful self-degradation of a spouse. It can hardly
be supposed that all that lies in these chapters is an abstract study
in the psychology of the emotions. It is actual human experience
that gives Hosea the key to divine truth.

6 Davidson (D.B. ii. 422) remarks that &ldquo;it was not his misfortunes
that gave Hosea his prophetic word. Israel&rsquo;s apostasy was
plain to him, and he foreshadowed her doom in Jezreel, the name
of his first child, before any misfortunes overtook him. At most,
his misfortunes may at a later time have given a complexion to his
prophetic thoughts.&rdquo; Wellhausen (p. 108) objects to the emergence
of the call from the experience, on the ground that the name given
to the first child gives no indication that Hosea had yet reached his
specific message, the infidelity of his wife and of Israel, though it
shows him already as a prophet. Marti (p. 15) agrees with Davidson
in making the order (a) call, (b) marriage and birth of three children,
(c) comprehension of the significance of the marriage for himself
and for Israel. The statement made above must be interpreted of
Hosea&rsquo;s specific message from Yahweh, as recorded in his book.

7 Marti disregards this generally accepted division, arguing that
(a) i.-iii. was not written earlier than iv.-xiv., (b) iii. is not Hoseanic,
(c) ii. is much more akin to iv.-xiv. than to i.-iii. (Comm. p. 1; cf.
Enc. Bib. 2123 n.3). He holds that another wife, not Gomer, is
intended in iii., which is an allegory referring to Israel, as Gomer
referred to Judah. His arguments are not convincing.

8 So, practically, Davidson, D.B. ii. p. 423 seq., where the detailed
references will be found.

9 This is too definite for the data; cf. Davidson, l.c. &ldquo;Hosea has
no clear idea of the instrument or means of Israel&rsquo;s destruction.
It is &lsquo;the sword&rsquo; (vii. 16, xi. 6), the &lsquo;enemy&rsquo; (viii. 3, v. 8-9);
or it is natural, internal decay (vii. 8-9, ix. 16), the moth and
rottenness (v. 12).&rdquo;

10 e.g. i. 10-ii. 1, ii. 14 f., iii. 5, v. 15-vi. 3, xi. 10-11.

11 Apart from glosses and minor alterations, the only other critical
problem of importance is that of the references to Judah scattered
throughout the book (i. 7, iv. 15, v. 5, v. 10 f., vi. 4, 11, viii.
14, x. 11, xi. 12). There is no inherent improbability in some
mention of the sister kingdom; but some of the actual references
do suggest interpolation, especially i. 7, where the deliverance of
Judah from Sennacherib in 701 B.C. seems intended. Each case,
as Wellhausen implies, is to be considered on its merits. On
these and other suspected passages, cf. Cheyne, Intro. to W. R.
Smith&rsquo;s Prophets of Israel, pp. xvii.-xxii.; Marti, p. 8; Harper,

HOSE-PIPE, or simply &ldquo;hose,&rdquo; the name given to flexible
piping by means of which water may be conveyed from one
place to another. One end of the pipe is connected to the source
of the water, while the other end is free, so that the direction of
the stream of water which issues from the pipe may be changed
at will. The method of manufacture and the strength of the
materials used depend naturally upon the particular use to
which the finished article is to be put. Simple garden hose is
often made of india-rubber or composition, but the hose intended
for fire brigade and similar important purposes must be of a much
more substantial material. The most satisfactory material is
the best long flax, although cotton is also extensively used for
many types of this fabric.

The flax fibre, after having been carefully spun into yarn,
is boiled twice and then beetled; these two processes remove
all injurious matter, and make the yarn soft and lustrous. The
yarn is then wound on to large bobbins, and made into a chain;
the number of threads in the chain depends upon the size of the
hose, which may be anything from half an inch to 15 in. or even
more in diameter. When the chain is warped, it is beamed
upon the weaver&rsquo;s beam, and the ends&mdash;either double or triple&mdash;are
drawn through the leaves of the cambs of heddles, passed
through the reed and finally tied to the cloth beam. The preparation
of the warp for any kind of loom varies very little, but the
weaving may vary greatly. In all cases the hose fabric is
essentially circular, although it appears quite flat during the
weaving operation.

There are very few hand-made fabrics which can compete
with the machine-made article, but the very best type of hose-pipe
is certainly one of the former class. The cloth can be made
much more cheaply in the power-loom than in the hand-loom, but,
up to the present, no power-loom has been made which can weave
as substantial a cloth as the hand-loom product; the weak
part in all hose-pipes is where the weft passes round the sides from
top to bottom of the fabric or vice versa, that is, the side corresponding
to the selvages in an ordinary cloth; the hand-loom
weaver can draw the weft tighter than is possible in the power-loom,
hence the threads at the sides can be brought close together,
and by this means the fabric is made almost, but not
quite, as perfect here as in other parts. It is essential that the
warp threads be held tightly in the loom, and to secure this, they
pass alternately over and under three or four back rests before
reaching the heddles or cambs, which are almost invariably
made of wire. Although the warp yarn is made very soft and
pliable by boiling and beetling, the weaver always tallows
it in order to make it work more easily.

Fig. 3.&mdash;Section through the Warp.


The commonest type of hose-pipe is made on the double-plain
principle of weaving, the cloth being perfectly plain but woven in
such a manner that the pipe is without seams of any kind. Fig. 1
is a design showing two repeats or eight shots in the way of the weft,
and six repeats or twenty-four-threads in the way of the warp,
consequently the weave is complete on four threads, or leaves, and
four picks. Fig. 2 illustrates the method of interlacing the threads
and the picks: this figure shows that twenty-three threads only are
used, the first thread&mdash;shown shaded in fig. 1&mdash;having been left out.
It is necessary to use a number of threads which is either one less
or one more than some multiple of four&mdash;the number of threads in
the unit weave. The sectional view (fig. 2), although indicating
the crossings of the warp and the weft, is quite different from an
actual section through the threads: the warp is almost invariably
two or three ply, and in addition two or more of these twisted
threads pass through the same heddle-eye in the camb; moreover,
they are set very closely together&mdash;so closely, indeed, that the threads
entirely conceal the weft; it is, therefore, impossible to give a correct
787
sectional view with satisfactory clearness, as the threads are so very
rank, but fig. 3 gives some idea of the structure of the fabric. This
view shows ninety-nine threads and one complete round of weft;
this round is, of course, equal to two picks or shots&mdash;one pick for
the top part of the cloth and one for the bottom part. A comparison
of this figure with fig. 2 will,
perhaps, make the description clearer.
The weft in fig. 3 is thinner than the
warp, but, in practice, it is always
much thicker, and may consist of
from two to seventy threads twisted
together.

Hose-pipes are also woven with the
three-leaf twill on both sides, and
occasionally with the four-leaf twill.
These pipes, woven with the twill
weaves, are usually lined with a pure
rubber tube which is fixed to the
inside of the cloth by another layer
of rubber after the cloth leaves the
loom. Such pipes have usually, but
not invariably, a smoother inner surface
than those which are unlined, hence, when they are used, less
friction is presented to the flow of water, and there is less tendency
for the pipe to leak. They are, therefore, suitable for
hotels, public buildings and similar places where their temporary
use will not result in undue damage to articles of furniture, carpets
and general decoration.

The greatest care must be observed in the weaving of these
fabrics, the slightest flaw in the structure rendering the article
practically useless. After the cloth has been woven, it is carefully
examined, and then steeped in a chemical solution which acts as
an antiseptic. The cloth is thus effectively preserved from mildew,
and is, in addition, made more pliable. Finally the hose-pipe is dried
artificially, and then fitted with the necessary couplings and nozzles.

For a more detailed description of circular weaving see Woodhouse
and Milne, Textile Design: Pure and Applied.

HOSHANGABAD, a town and district of British India, in
the Nerbudda division of the Central Provinces. The town
stands on the left bank of the Nerbudda, 1009 ft. above the sea,
and has a railway station. Pop. (1901), 14,940. It is supposed
to have been founded by Hoshang Shah, the second of the Ghori
kings of Malwa, in the 15th century; but it remained an insignificant
place till the Bhopal conquest about 1720, when a
massive stone fort was constructed, with its base on the river,
commanding the Bhopal road. It sustained several sieges during
the 18th century, and passed alternately into the hands of the
Bhopal and Nagpur rulers. Since 1818 it has been the residence
of the chief British officials in charge of the district. It has a
government high school, and agricultural school and a brass-working
industry.

The District of Hoshangabad has an area of 3676 sq. m.
Pop. (1901), 449,165, showing a decrease of 10% in the decade,
due to famine. It may be described as a valley of varying
breadth, extending for 150 m. between the Nerbudda river and
the Satpura mountains. The soil consists chiefly of black basaltic
alluvium, often more than 20 ft. deep; but along the banks of the
Nerbudda the fertility of the land compensates for the tameness
of the scenery. Towards the west, low stony hills and broken
ridges cut up the level ground, while the Vindhyas and the
Satpuras throw out jutting spurs and ranges. In this wilder
country considerable regions are covered with jungle. On the
south the lofty range which shuts in the valley is remarkable
in mountain scenery, surpassing in its picturesque irregularity
the Vindhyan chain in the north. Many streams take their
rise amid its precipices, then, winding through deep glens, flow
across the plain between sandy banks covered with low jungle till
they swell the waters of the Nerbudda. None is of any importance
except the Tawa, which is interesting to the geologist on
account of the many minerals to be found along its course. The
boundary rivers, the Nerbudda and Tapti, are the only considerable
waters in Hoshangabad. The principal crops are
wheat, millets and oil-seeds. The district is traversed throughout
its length by the Great Indian Peninsula railway.



HOSHEA (Heb. for &ldquo;deliverance&rdquo;), the last king of Israel,
in the Bible. The attempt of his predecessor Pekah to take
Jerusalem with the help of his ally Rasun (Rezin) of Damascus
was frustrated by the intervention of Tiglath-Pileser IV.
(see Ahaz), who attacked Gilead, Galilee and the north frontier,
and carried off some of its population (cp. 1 Chron. v. 26).
Pekah&rsquo;s resistance to Assyria led to a conspiracy in which
he lost his life, and Hoshea the son of Elah became king
(2 Kings xv. 27-30). The Assyrian king held him as his vassal
(and indeed claims to have set him on the throne), and exacted
from him a yearly tribute. Meanwhile, Damascus was besieged
(733-732 B.C.), Ra&#7779;un was slain and the inhabitants deported
(2 Kings xvi. 9; LXX. omits &ldquo;to Kir,&rdquo; but see Amos i. 5).
The impending fate of Damascus is illustrated by Isaiah (vii. 16,
viii. 4, xvii. 1-11), who also gives a vivid description of the
impression left by the Assyrian army (v. 26-30). After the
death of Tiglath-Pileser, Israel regained confidence (Isa. ix. 8-x. 4)
and took steps to recover its independence. Its policy vacillated&mdash;&ldquo;like
a silly dove&rdquo; (Hos. vii. 11), and at length negotiations
were opened with Mizraim. The annual payment of tribute
ceased and Shalmaneser IV. (who began to reign in 727 B.C.)
at once laid siege to Samaria, which fell at the end of three years
(722-721 B.C.). The achievement is claimed by his successor
Sargon. Hoshea was killed, the land was again partly depopulated
and a governor appointed (2 Kings xviii. 9-12; cp. xvii.
1 sqq.). For other allusions to this period see Hosea, Isaiah.


2 Kings xvii. 3 and 5 imply two attacks by Shalmaneser: in the
first of which Hoshea was imprisoned and perhaps blinded (Cheyne,
emending, &ldquo;shut him up&rdquo; in v. 4), although in v. 6 he is still reigning;
see on this Winckler, Keilinschr. u. Alte Test.3 p. 268; Burney,
Kings, p. 328 seq.; Skinner, Kings, p. 372 seq. The chronological
notes, moreover, are extremely confused; contrast xv. 30 with
xvii. 1. The usual identification of So (or Seve), king of Mizraim,
with Shabaka of Egypt is difficult, partly on chronological grounds
(which Petrie, History of Egypt, pp. 277, 281 sqq. does not remove),
and partly because the Ethiopian dominion in Egypt appears to be
still weak and divided. The Assyrian records name a certain Sibi
as officer, and also Piru (Pharaoh!) as king of Musri, and it is
doubtful whether Hoshea&rsquo;s ally was a petty prince of Egypt or of
a N. Arabian district (see Mizraim). If the latter, Hoshea&rsquo;s policy
becomes more intelligible; see Whitehouse, Isaiah, p. 17 seq.;
Jews: History; Philistines. On the depopulation of Samaria
and the introduction of colonists, see Winckler&rsquo;s objections,
Alttest. Untersuch. pp. 95-107, with Burney&rsquo;s criticisms, Kings,
p. 334 seq.

HOSHIARPUR, a town of British India, in the Jullundur
division of the Punjab. Pop. (1901), 17,549. It was founded,
according to tradition, about the early part of the 14th century.
In 1809 it was occupied by Ranjit Singh. The maharaja and
his successors maintained a considerable cantonment 1 m. S.E.
of the town, and the British government kept it up for several
years after the annexation of the Punjab in 1849. There are
manufactures of cotton goods, inlaid woodwork, lacquered ware,
shoes and copper vessels.

The District of Hoshiarpur comprises an area of 2244
sq. m.; pop. (1901) 989,782, showing a decrease of 2% in the
decade, compared with an increase of 12% during the previous
decade. It falls into two nearly equal portions of hill and
plain country. Its eastern face consists of the westward slope
of the Solar Singhi Hills; parallel with that ridge, a line of
lower heights belonging to the Siwalik range traverses the
district from south to north, while between the two chains
stretches a valley of uneven width, known as the Jaswan Dun.
Its upper portion is crossed by the Sohan torrent, while the
Sutlej sweeps into its lower end through a break in the hills,
and flows in a southerly direction till it turns the flank of the
central range, and debouches westwards upon the plains. This
western plain consists of alluvial formation, with a general
westerly slope owing to the deposit of silt from the mountain
torrents in the sub-montane tract. The Beas has a fringe of
lowland, open to moderate but not excessive inundations, and
considered very fertile. A considerable area is covered by
government woodlands, under the care of the forest department.
Rice is largely grown, in the marshy flats along the banks of
the Beas. Several religious fairs are held, at Anandpur, Mukerian
and Chintpurni, all of which attract an enormous concourse
of people. The district, owing to its proximity to the hills,
possesses a comparatively cool and humid climate. Cotton
fabrics are manufactured, and sugar, rice and other grains,
tobacco and indigo are among the exports.

788

The country around Hoshiarpur formed part of the old Hindu
kingdom of Katoch In Jullundur. The state was eventually
broken up, and the present district was divided between the
rajas of Ditarpur and Jaswan. They retained undisturbed
possession of their territories until 1759, when the rising Sikh
chieftains commenced a series of encroachments upon the hill
tracts. In 1815 the aggressive maharaja, Ranjit Singh, forced
the ruler of Jaswan to resign his territories in exchange for
an estate on feudal tenure; three years later the raja of Ditarpur
met with similar treatment. By the close of the year 1818 the
whole country from the Sutlej to the Beas had come under
the government of Lahore, and after the first Sikh war in 1846
passed to the British government. The deposed rajas of Ditarpur
and Jaswan received cash pensions from the new rulers, but
expressed bitter disappointment at not being restored to their
former sovereign position. Accordingly the outbreak of the
second Sikh war, in 1848 found the disaffected chieftains ready
for rebellion. They organized a revolt, but the two rajas and
the other ringleaders were captured, and their estates confiscated.



HOSIERY, a term used to designate all manufactured textile
fabrics which in their process of manufacture have been built
on the principle of looping or loop structure. The origin of the
term is obvious, being derived from &ldquo;hose&rdquo; or stocking, this
being one of the earliest garments made by the process of
knitting (q.v.). While it still forms one of the staples of the
trade, it is only one of a very numerous and diversified range
of applications of the entire industry. The elastic structure
of knitting makes it very adaptable for all kinds of body or
underwear. There is scarcely a single textile article manufactured
but can be reproduced on the knitting or loop structure principle.
The art of knitting is of very modern origin as compared with
that of weaving. No certain allusion to the art occurs before
the beginning of the 15th century. In an act of parliament
of Henry VII. (1488) knitted woollen caps are mentioned. It
is supposed that the art was first practised in Scotland, and
thence carried into England, and that caps were made by knitting
for some period before the more difficult feat of stocking-making
was attempted. In an act of Edward VI. (1553) &ldquo;knitte hose,
knitte peticotes, knitte gloves and knitte sleeves&rdquo; are enumerated,
and the trade of hosiers, among others, included in an act
dated 1563. Spanish silk stockings were worn on rare occasions
by Henry VIII., and the same much-prized articles are also
mentioned in connexion with the wardrobe of Edward VI.

Knitting, or loop formation by mechanical means, is divided
into two distinct principles&mdash;frame-work knitting and warp
knitting. Both principles may be employed in the formation
of a large variety of plain and fancy stitches or a combination
of the two.


Frame-work Knitting in its simplest form consists of rows of
loops supporting each other&mdash;built from one continuous thread of
yarn and running from one side of the fabric to the other and back
(fig. 1). It is on this principle of stitch that the greatest amount
of hosiery is built (hose, shirts, pants).

(back of fabric).
Fig. 2.&mdash;A Single Thread
formed into a Chain of
Crocket Work, showing the
Loop Structure of the plain
Warp-knitted Fabric. It
is built up as shown in the
diagram by a number of
threads running up the fabric.

Warp Knitting in its simplest form consists of rows of loops, but
the number of threads employed are equal to the number of loops
in the width of the fabric. Thus it will be seen that the threads
run lengthwise of the fabric (fig. 2). This principle gives greater
scope for reproducing designs in openwork and colour than that of
frame-work knitting. For this reason it is largely used in the shawl,
glove and fancy hosiery industries.

Machinery.&mdash;In hand knitting the implements employed (a few
needles or wires) are very simple and inexpensive. In the manufacturing
industry
the most complex
and ingenious
machinery is used.
In 1589 the Rev.
William Lee, a
graduate of St
John&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge, while
acting as curate (or
vicar) of Calverton,
Nottinghamshire,
introduced his
stocking-frame.
This machine was
the first mechanical
means employed to
produce a looped or
knitted fabric. This
frame or machine of
Lee&rsquo;s was the origin
of all the hosiery
and lace machines
at present in use.
One of the most
remarkable points
about his invention
was its completeness
and adaptability
for the work
for which its inventor
intended it. The
main principles of
Lee&rsquo;s frame are embodied
in most of the rotary or power frames of the present day.
Fig. 3 shows a hand frame of the present day.

In hand knitting an indefinite number of loops are skewered on
a wire or pin, but, in Lee&rsquo;s frame, an individual hooked or bearded
needle is employed for the support and formation of each loop in
the breadth of the fabric. This needle consists of a shank with a
terminal spring-pointed hook (or beard), the point of which can be
pressed at will into a groove or eye in the shank. For method by
which the loops are formed on the needles of the frame see fig. 4.
This shows a few of Lee&rsquo;s hooked or bearded needles having the old
loops or work hanging round the needle shanks. The thread of
yarn which is to form the new row of loops is laid over the needle
shanks and waved or looped between each pair of needles. This
waving or looping ensures sufficient yarn being drawn and loops of
a uniform size being made, so that a regular and level fabric will be
produced. The looping or waving is obtained by having thin plates
of shaped metal, called sinkers, which have a nose-shaped point
and hang between
the needles. When
looping they have
an  individual
movement downwards
between the
needles, and as
they fall the nose-shaped
point carries
the yarn down,
thus forming the
new loop (fig. 5).
The size of the loop
is regulated by the
distance the sinker
is allowed to fall.
After the thread
of yarn has been
looped between
the needle shanks
by the sinkers, the
loops are brought
forward under the needle beards or hooks. A presser bar is
now brought down to close or press all the points of the needle
beards into the eye in the shank. Thus all the hook ends of the
needles are temporarily closed, with the newly formed loops under
them. While in this position, the old loops hanging round the
shank are brought forward and landed on to the top of the needle
beard and off the needle altogether, being thus left hanging round,
or supported by the loops newly formed. The needle beards are now
released, and the loops drawn back along the shanks to be in position
for next new course of loops. The foregoing is only an outline of
how the loops are formed on the needles. It is not necessary here
to enter into a description of the complex mechanical movements
of Lee&rsquo;s stocking-frame. The first fabric made by Lee was of a
789
flat, even-selvedged nature, so that garments had to be cut to
shape from the fabric. He soon learned to fashion or shape the
garment at will, during the process of making, by transferring loops
at the edges, inwards to narrow, or outwards to widen. This process
at the present day is known as fashioning, and all garments of the
best make are shaped or fashioned in this manner. After Lee had
practised his new art for a few years at Calverton he removed to
London, but on his receiving no help or encouragement from Queen
Elizabeth or her successor, King James, he was induced to cross over
to France with his frames. There he built up a flourishing industry
at Rouen, under the patronage of the French king, Henry IV.
Through the murder of this monarch he lost his patronage and died
of want about the year 1610. He was buried in an unknown grave
in Paris.

Stitch.

A number of improvements had been made on Lee&rsquo;s frame during
the 18th century. The one of greatest importance was the rib
machine invented by Jedediah Strutt of Belper in 1758. It was
not what could be actually termed an improvement on Lee&rsquo;s frame,
but an addition to it. Lee&rsquo;s frame was not altered in any way,
Strutt&rsquo;s machine being added to it, and the two being worked in
conjunction produced a fabric of a more elastic nature and alike
on both sides (fig. 6). Strutt&rsquo;s machine consisted of a set of needles
placed at right angles to and between Lee&rsquo;s
plain needles, with the result that, when
knitting, the frame needles drew their loops
to one side and the machine needles their
loops to the opposite side of the fabric. The
first offshoot from frame-work knitting was
the invention of the hand warp loom in
1775. It was improved by the addition of
the Dawson wheel by William Dawson in
1791. This machine is the origin of the
various complex machines now working on
this principle. Some of these have Jacquard mechanism attached,
and nearly all of them are driven by motive power. About the
middle of the 19th century close on 50,000 of Lee&rsquo;s hand frames
were in use, finding employment for nearly 100,000 persons. Many
attempts had been made previously to transform Lee&rsquo;s frame into
a power or rotary frame. One of the first and most successful was
that invented by Luke Barton in 1857. This frame was fitted with
self-acting mechanism for fashioning, and was practically Lee&rsquo;s
frame having rotary shafts with cams added to give the various
movements, this type of frame being known as straight bar rotary
frames. In 1864 William Cotton of Loughborough altered this
frame by reversing the positions of the needles and sinkers. Although
made by various builders it is still known as the &ldquo;Cotton Patent
Rotary Frame&rdquo; (fig. 7). Since 1864 a great number of important
improvements and additions have been made to this frame. Single
frames are built which will turn off one dozen pairs of hose at once,
with the attention of one person. One of the most important
inventions in connexion with the hosiery trade was the latch, tumbler,
or self-acting needle invented by Matthew Townsend and
David Moulding of Leicester in 1858. Previous to this
Lee&rsquo;s type of needle was the only one in use. This latch-needle
(fig. 8) consists of a stem having a butt at lower
end by which it receives its knitting action from cams,
790
the upper end being turned into a hook. Near the hook end
and attached to the stem by a pin is the spoon-shaped latch,
which closes over the hook as required. Machines fitted with
latch-needles
have grooves in which the stem of the needle works. Cams,
which act on the
needle butts, give
the needles their
individual knitting
action in rotation.
This needle
is self-acting, in
that it is made to
draw its own loop,
sinkers being dispensed
with.



Fig. 8.&mdash;Various Shapes of the Latch Needle.

Fig. 9.&mdash;Individual Action of the Latch Needle.

Fig. 9 shows the
looping action of
this needle. The
needles when not
knitting have a
loop round their
shank, thus holding
the latch open. When about to knit, they are raised individually
and in rotation (by the cams acting on the needle butts) to receive
the new loop of yarn.

Down till almost the middle of the 19th century only a flat web
could be knitted in the machines in use, and for the finishing of
stockings, &amp;c., it was necessary to seam up the selvedges of web
shaped on the frame (fashioned work), or to cut and seam them
from even web (cut work). The introduction of any device by
which seamless garments could be fabricated was obviously a great
desideratum, and it is a singular fact that a machine capable of
doing this was patented in 1816 by Sir Marc I. Brunel. This frame
was the origin of the French-German loop-wheel circular frame of
the present day. Brunel&rsquo;s frame was greatly improved by Peter
Claussen of Brussels and was shown at an exhibition in Nottingham
in 1845. This frame had horizontal placed needles fixed on a rotating
rim. A few years later Moses Mellor of Nottingham transformed this
type of frame by altering the position of the needles to perpendicular.
This is now known as the English loop-wheel circular frame. After
the invention of the latch-needle there was a revolution in the
hosiery machine-building industry, new types of machines being
invented, fitted to
work with latch-needles.
Among
others there was the
latch-needle circular
frame, invented by
Thomas Thompson,
which was the origin
of the English latch-needle
circular frame,
a frame largely used
for the production
of wide circular
fabric.

A circular knitting
machine of American
origin is the type of
machine on which is
produced the seamless
hosiery of to-day.
Like the sewing machine it is largely used in the home as well as in
the factory. From this machine all the circular automatic power
machines for making plain and rib seamless hose and half hose
have been developed. The &ldquo;flat&rdquo; or &ldquo;lamb&rdquo; type of machine,
an American invention, was introduced by J. W. Lamb in 1863.
This machine has two needle beds or rows of needles sloping at an
angle of nearly 90°.

A great many varieties of this type of machine have been invented
for the production of all kinds of plain and fancy hosiery. It is
built in small sizes to be wrought by hand or in large power machines.
A large variety of sewing, seaming and linking machines are employed
in the hosiery industry for the purpose of putting together
or joining all kinds of hosiery and knitted goods. These machines
have almost entirely superseded the sewing or joining of the garments
by hand.

The principle centres in Great Britain of the hosiery industry are
Leicester and Nottingham and the surrounding districts. It is also
an industry of some extent in the south of Scotland.

HOSIUS, or Osius (c. 257-359), bishop of Cordova, was born
about A.D. 257, probably at Cordova, although from a passage
in Zosimus it has sometimes been conjectured that he was
believed by that writer to be a native of Egypt. Elected to
the see of Cordova before the end of the 3rd century, he narrowly
escaped martyrdom in the persecution of Maximian (303-305).
In 305 or 306 he attended the council of Illiberis or Elvira (his
name appearing second in the list of those present), and upheld
its severe canons concerning such points of discipline as the
treatment of the lapsed and clerical marriages. In 313 he appears
at the court of Constantine, being expressly mentioned by
name in a constitution directed by the emperor to Caecilianus
of Carthage in that year. In 323 he was the bearer and possibly
the writer of Constantine&rsquo;s letter to Bishop Alexander of Alexandria
and Arius his deacon, bidding them cease disturbing
the peace of the church; and, on the failure of the negotiations
in Egypt, it was doubtless with the active concurrence of Hosius
that the council of Nicaea was convened in 325. He certainly
took part in its proceedings, and was one of the large number
of &ldquo;confessors&rdquo; present; that he presided is a very doubtful
assertion, as also that he was the principal author of the Nicene
Creed. Still he powerfully influenced the judgment of the
emperor in favour of the orthodox party. After a period of quiet
life in his own diocese, Hosius presided in 343 at the fruitless
synod of Sardica, which showed itself so hostile to Arianism;
and afterwards he spoke and wrote in favour of Athanasius in
such a way as to bring upon himself a sentence of banishment
to Sirmium (355). From his exile he wrote to Constantius II.
his only extant composition, a letter not unjustly characterized
by the great French historian Sebastian Tillemont as displaying
gravity, dignity, gentleness, wisdom, generosity and in fact
all the qualities of a great soul and a great bishop. Subjected
to continual pressure the old man, who was near his hundredth
year, was weak enough to sign the formula adopted by the
second synod of Sirmium in 357, which involved communion
with the Arians but not the condemnation of Athanasius. He
was then permitted to return to his diocese, where he died in 359.

HOSIUS, STANISLAUS (1504-1579), Polish cardinal, was
born in Cracow on the 5th of May 1504. He studied law at
Padua and Bologna, and entering the church became in 1549
bishop of Kulm, in 1551 bishop of Ermland, and in 1561 cardinal.
Hosius had Jesuit sympathies and actively opposed the Protestant
reformation, going so far as to desire a repetition of
the St Bartholomew massacre in Poland. Apart from its being
&ldquo;the property of the Roman Church,&rdquo; he regarded the Bible
as having no more worth than the fables of Aesop. Hosius
was not distinguished as a theologian, though he drew up the
Confessio fidei christiana catholica adopted by the synod of
Piotrkow in 1557. He was, however, supreme as a diplomatist
and administrator. Besides carrying through many difficult
negotiations, he founded the lyceum of Braunsberg, which
became the centre of the Roman Catholic mission among
Protestants. He died at Capranica near Rome on the 5th
of August 1579.


A collected edition of his works was published at Cologne in 1584.

HOSKINS, JOHN (d. 1664), English miniature painter, the
uncle of Samuel Cooper, who received his artistic education in
Hoskins&rsquo;s house. His finest miniatures are at Ham House,
Montagu House, Windsor Castle, Amsterdam and in the Pierpont
Morgan collection. Vertue stated that Hoskins had a son, and
Redgrave added that the son painted a portrait of James II.
in 1686 and was paid £10, 5s, although it is not supported
by any reference in the State Papers. Some contemporary
inscriptions on the miniatures at Ham House record them as
the work of &ldquo;Old Hoskins,&rdquo; but the fact of the existence
of a younger artist of the same name is settled by a miniature
in the Pierpont Morgan collection, signed by Hoskins, and
bearing an authentic engraved inscription on its contemporary
frame to the effect that it represents the duke of Berwick at
the age of twenty-nine in 1700. The elder Hoskins was buried
on the 22nd of February 1664, in St Paul&rsquo;s, Covent Garden, and
as there is no doubt of the authenticity of this miniature or of
791
the signature upon it, it is evident that he had a son who survived
him thirty-six years and whose monogram we find upon this
portrait. The frame of it has also the royal coat of arms debruised,
the batons of a marshal of France, the collar of the
Golden Fleece and the ducal coronet.

HOSMER, HARRIET GOODHUE (1830-1908), American
sculptor, was born at Watertown, Massachussetts, on the 9th
of October 1830. She early showed marked aptitude for modelling,
and studied anatomy with her father, a physician, and
afterwards at the St Louis Medical College. She then studied
in Boston until 1852, when, with her friend Charlotte Cushman,
she went to Rome, where from 1853 to 1860 she was the pupil of
the English sculptor John Gibson. She lived in Rome until a few
years before her death. There she was associated with Nathaniel
Hawthorne, Thorwaldsen, Flaxman, Thackeray, George Eliot and
George Sand; and she was frequently the guest of the Brownings
at Casa Guidi, in Florence. Among her works are &ldquo;Daphne&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Medusa,&rdquo; ideal heads (1853); &ldquo;Puck&rdquo; (1855), a spirited
and graceful conception which she copied for the prince of
Wales, the duke of Hamilton and others; &ldquo;Oenone&rdquo; (1855),
her first life-sized figure, now in the St Louis Museum of Fine
Arts; &ldquo;Beatrice Cenci&rdquo; (1857), for the Mercantile Library
of St Louis; &ldquo;Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra, in Chains&rdquo; (1859),
now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City; &ldquo;A
Sleeping Faun&rdquo; (1867); &ldquo;A Waking Faun&rdquo;; a bronze statue
of Thomas H. Benton (1868) for Lafayette Park, St Louis;
bronze gates for the earl of Brownlow&rsquo;s art gallery at Ashridge
Hall; a Siren fountain for Lady Marian Alford; a fountain for
Central Park, New York City; a monument to Abraham
Lincoln; and, for the Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893,
statues of the queen of Naples as the &ldquo;heroine of Gaëta,&rdquo; and
of Queen Isabella of Spain. Miss Hosmer died at Watertown,
Mass., on the 21st of February 1908.



HOSPICE (Lat. hospitium, entertainment, hospitality, inn,
hospes, host), the name usually given to the homes of rest and
refuge kept by religious houses for pilgrims and guests. The
most famous hospices are those of the Great and Little St
Bernard Passes in the Alps.



HOSPITAL (Lat. hospitalis, the adjective of hospes, host or
guest), a term now in general use for institutions in which
medical treatment is given to the sick or injured. The place
where a guest was received, was in Lat. hospitium (Fr. hospice),
but the terms hospitalis (sc. domus), hospitale (sc. cubiculum) and
hospitalia (sc. cubicula) came into use in the same sense. Hence
were derived on the one hand the Fr. hospital, hôpital, applied
to establishments for temporary occupation by the sick for the
purpose of medical treatment, and hospice to places for permanent
occupation by the poor, infirm, incurable or insane; on the
other, the form hôtel, which became restricted (except in the
ease of hôtel-Dieu) to private or public dwelling-houses for
ordinary occupation. In English, while &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; retained the
earlier sense and &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; has become confined to that of a
superior inn (q.v.), &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; was used both in the sense of a
permanent retreat for the poor infirm or for the insane, and also
for a regular institution for the temporary reception of sick
cases; but modern usage has gradually restricted it mainly to
the latter, other words, such as almshouse and asylum, being
preferred in the former cases.

The Origin of Hospitals.&mdash;In spite of contrary opinions the
germ of the hospital system may be seen in pre-Christian times
(see Charity and Charities). Pinel goes so far as to declare
that there were asylums distinctly set apart for the insane in
the temples of Saturn in ancient Egypt. But this is probably
an exaggeration, the real historical facts pointing to the existence
of medical schools in connexion with the temples generally, to
the knowledge that the priests possessed what medical science
existed, and finally to the rite of &ldquo;Incubation,&rdquo; which involved
the visit of sick persons to the temple, in the shade of which they
slept, that the god might inform them by dreams of the treatment
they ought to follow. The temples of Saturn are known
to have existed some 4000 years before Christ; and that those
temples were medical schools in their earliest form is beyond
question. The reason why no records of these temples have
survived is due to the fact that they were destroyed in a religious
revolution which swept away the very name of Saturn from the
monuments in the country. Professor Georg Ebers of Leipzig,
whose possession of that important handbook of Egyptian
medicine called the Papyrus Ebers constitutes him an authority,
says the Heliopolis certainly had a clinic united to the temple.
The temples of Dendera, Thebes and Memphis, are other examples.
Those early medical works, the Books of Hermes, were
preserved in the shrines. Patients coming to them paid contributions
to the priests. The most famous temples in Greece for
the cure of disease were those of Aesculapius at Cos and Trikka,
while others at Rhodes, Cnidus, Pergamum and Epidaurus were
less known but frequented. Thus it is clear that both in Egypt
and in Greece the custom of laying the sick in the precincts of
the temples was a national practice.

Alexandria again was a famous medical centre. Before
describing the European growth of the hospital system in
modern times, to which its development in the Roman Empire
is the natural introduction, it will be well to dispose very briefly
of the facts relating to the hospital system in the East. Harun
al-Rashid (A.D. 763-809) attached a college to every mosque,
and to that again a hospital. He placed at Bagdad an asylum
for the insane open to all believers; and there was a large number
of public infirmaries for the sick without payment in that city.
Benjamin, the Jewish traveller, notes an efficient scheme for the
reception of the sick in A.D. 1173, which had long been in existence.
The Buddhists no less than the Mahommedans had their hospitals,
and as early as 260 B.C. the emperor Asoka founded the many
hospitals of which Hindustan could then boast. The one at
Surat, made famous by travellers, and considered to have been
built under the emperor&rsquo;s second edict, is still in existence.
These hospitals contained provision so extensive as to be quite
comparable to modern institutions. In China the only records
that remain are those of books of very early date dealing with
the theory of medicine. To return to India, the hospitals of
Asoka were swept away by a revival of Brahmanism, and a
practical hiatus exists between the hospitals he introduced
and those that were refounded by the British ascendancy.
Hadrian&rsquo;s reign contains the first notice of a military hospital in
Rome. At the beginning of the Christian era we hear of the
existence of open surgeries (of various price and reputation),
the specialization of the medical profession, and the presence
of women practitioners, often as obstetricians. Iatria, or
tabernae-medicae, are described by Galen and Placetus: many
towns built them at their own cost. These iatria attended
almost entirely to out-patients, and the system of medicine
fostered by them continued without much development down
to the middle of the 18th century. It is to be noted that these
out-patients paid reasonable fees. In Christian days no establishments
were founded for the relief of the sick till the time of
Constantine. A law of Justinian referring to various institutions
connected with the church mentions among them the Nosocomia,
which correspond to our idea of hospitals. In A.D. 370 Basil
had one built for lepers at Caesarea. St Chrysostom founded
a hospital at Constantinople. At Alexandria an order of 600
Parabolani attended to the sick, being chosen for the purpose
for their experience by the prelate of the city (A.D. 416). Fabiola,
a rich Roman lady, founded the first hospital at Rome possessed
of a convalescent home in the country. She even became a nurse
herself. St Augustine founded one at his see of Hippo. These
Nosocomia fell indeed almost entirely into the hands of the
church, which supported them by its revenues when necessary
and controlled their administration. Salerno became famous as a
school of medicine; its rosiest days were between A.D. 1000 and
1050. Frederick II. prescribed the course for students there,
and founded a rival school at Naples. At this period the connexion
between monasteries and hospitals becomes a marked
one. The crusaders also created another bond between the
church and hospital development, as the route they traversed
was marked by such foundations. Lepers were some of the
earliest patients for whom a specialized treatment was recognized,
792
and in 1118 a leprosarium was built in London for isolation
purposes. Russia seems the one country where the interconnexion
of hospital and monastery was not to be observed.
After the period already reached, the 13th century, hospitals
became common enough to demand individual or at any rate
national treatment.

History of the Hospital Movement.&mdash;We have now to consider
the principles upon which the provision of the best form of
medical care in hospitals can be secured for all classes of people.
Though hospitals cannot be claimed as a direct result of Christianity,
no doubt it softened the relations between men, and
gradually tended to instil humanitarian views and to make
them popular with the civilized peoples of the world. These
principles, as civilization grew, education improved, and the
tastes and requirements of the common people were developed,
made men and women of many races realize that the treatment
of disease in buildings set apart exclusively for the care of the
sick was, in fact, a necessity in urban districts. The establishment
of a hospital freed the streets of the abuses attendant upon
beggars and other poor creatures, who made their ailments the
chief ground of appeal for alms. As the knowledge of hygiene and
of the doctrine of cleanliness and purity in regard not only to
dwellings and towns, but also in relation to food of all descriptions,
including water, became known and appreciated, hospitals
were found to be of even greater importance, if that is possible,
to the healthy in crowded communities, than to the sick.
It took many centuries before sound hygiene really began to
occupy the position of importance which it is now known to
possess, not only in regard to the treatment and cure of disease,
but to its prevention and eradication. So the history of the
world shows, that, whereas a few of the larger towns in most
countries contained hospitals of sorts, up to and including the
middle ages, it was not until the commencement of the 18th
century that inhabitants of important but relatively small towns
of from 50,000 to 100,000 inhabitants began to provide themselves
with a hospital for the care of the sick. Thus, twenty-three
of the principal English counties appear to have had no general
hospital prior to 1710, while London itself at that date, so
far as the relief of the sick was concerned, was mainly, if not
entirely, dependent upon St Bartholomew&rsquo;s and St Thomas&rsquo;s
Hospitals. These facts are interesting to note, because we are
enabled from them to deduce from recent events that hospital
buildings in the past, though the planning of most of them
was faulty to begin with and became more and more faulty as
extensions were added to the original buildings, did in fact
suffice to satisfy the requirements of the medical profession for
nearly two centuries. In other words, under the old condition
of affairs the life of a building devoted to the care of the sick
might be considered as at least 150 years. To-day, under the
conditions which modern science impose upon the management,
probably few hospital buildings are likely to be regarded as
efficient for the purpose of treating the sick for more than from
30 to 50 years.

The foregoing statement is based upon the history of British
hospitals of importance throughout the country, but the same
remark will apply in practice to hospital buildings almost
everywhere throughout the world. In truth, hospitals have
been more developed and improved in Great Britain than in
other countries, though, since the last quarter of the 19th century,
German scientists especially have added much to the efficiency
of the accommodation for the sick, not only at hospitals but
in private clinics, and many German ideas have been accepted
and copied by other countries. In Great Britain hospitals for
the treatment of general and special diseases are mainly maintained
upon what is known as the voluntary system. On the
European continent, hospitals as a rule are maintained by the
state or municipalities, and this system is so fully developed in
Sweden and elsewhere that a sound economical principle has
been embroidered upon the hospital system, to the great physical
and moral advantage of all classes of the community. The system
referred to confers great benefits upon inhabitants in large towns
by bringing the poor-law and voluntary institutions into more
intimate association, although they may be managed by separate
governing bodies. The plan pursued is to demand payment
from all patients who are admitted to the hospital under a scale
of charges divided into three or four grades. The first grade
pays a substantial sum and obtains anything or everything the
patient may care to have or to pay for, subject to the control
of the medical attendant. The second pays much less, but
a remunerative rate, for all they receive at the hospital; and
the third and fourth classes are very poor people or paupers,
who are paid for on a graduated scale by the poor-law authorities,
or the communal government, or the municipality. Under this
system well-to-do thrifty artisans and improvident paupers are
all treated by one staff, controlled by one administration, and
are located in immediate proximity to each other though in
separate pavilions. We have no doubt, as the result of many
years&rsquo; investigation and an accurate knowledge of the working of
the system, that this is the true principle to enforce in providing
adequate medical relief for large urban populations everywhere
throughout the world. It should be accompanied by a system
of government insurance, whereby all classes who desire to be
thrifty may pay a small annual premium in the days of health,
and secure adequate hospital treatment and care when ill.
Provided that pay wings were added to the existing voluntary
and municipal hospitals, it should be found that the relatively
small annual premium of £3 per annum should enable the
policyholders to defray the cost of medical treatment in a pay
ward or at a consultation department of a great hospital as a
matter of business. In the United States of America most large
towns have great hospitals, usually known as city hospitals,
administered and mainly supported by the municipality. Many
such institutions have pay wards, but nowhere, so far as we have
been able to discover, has the system of medical relief in its
entirety been organized as yet upon the business system we have
just referred to.

As to the relative merits and demerits of the systems of
government of municipal hospitals and voluntary hospitals a
few words may be useful. There can be no doubt that the
voluntary hospital in Great Britain has had a remarkable effect
for good upon all classes in the making of modern England.
The management of these institutions is frequently representative
of all classes of the people, while the voluntary system, as the
Hospital Sunday collections all over the country, and all over the
English-speaking world, prove, has united all creeds in the good
work of caring and providing for the sick and injured members
of each community. Again the voluntary system makes for
efficiency in the administration of all hospitals. Each voluntary
hospital is dependent upon its popularity and efficiency, in
large measure, for the financial support it receives. In this way
an ill-managed voluntary hospital, or one which has ceased to
fulfil any useful public purpose, is sure to disappear in due course
under the voluntary system. Voluntary hospitals are always
open to, as well as supported by, the public, and, owing largely
to the example so prominently set by King Edward VII. and
members of the royal family, more people every year devote
some time in some way to the cause of the hospitals. Attached
to the voluntary hospitals are the principal medical and nursing
schools upon which the public depend for the supply of doctors
and nurses. The education of students and nurses in a clinical
hospital makes that hospital the most desirable place for everybody
when they are really ill. In such a hospital no patient
can be overlooked, no wrong or imperfect diagnosis can long
remain undiscovered and unrectified, and nowhere else have
the patients so continuous a guarantee that the treatment they
receive will be of the best, while the provision made for their
comfort and welfare, owing to the unceasing and ever varying
quality of the criticism to which the work of everybody, from
the senior physician to the humblest official, is subjected in a
clinical hospital, is unequalled anywhere else. At a great
voluntary hospital, not only do hundreds of medical students
and nurses work in the wards, but thousands of people, in the
persons of the patients&rsquo; friends, and those members of the public
who take an interest in hospitals, pass through the wards in the
793
course of every year. Again, each voluntary hospital has to live
by competition, a fact which guarantees that everything in the
way of new treatment and scientific development shall in due
course find its proper place within the walls of such an establishment.
Open as they are to the full inspection of everybody
whose knowledge and presence can promote efficiency, the
voluntary hospitals have shown, especially since the last quarter
of the 19th century, a continuous development and improvement.
Here the patients are treated with invariable kindness
and consideration, as human beings rather than cases, to the
great benefit of the whole human family as represented by the
officials, the patients and the students, with their relations and
friends, the honorary medical officers, hundreds of medical
practitioners and nurses, who receive their medical training
in the hospitals, and the ever-increasing number of governors and
supporters by whose contributions voluntary hospitals live.
The great missionary and social value of the voluntary hospitals
to the whole community cannot be questioned, and they have
been of inestimable value to the churches by inculcating the
higher principles of humanity, while removing the many acerbities
which might otherwise prevail between rich and poor in large
cities.

The voluntary hospitals are attended, however, by certain disadvantages
which do not attach to municipal institutions. A
municipality which undertakes the provision of hospitals for
the entire community is largely able to plan out the urban area,
and to provide that each hospital site selected shall not only be
suitable for the purpose, but that it shall be so chosen as to
contribute to make the whole system of hospital provision easily
accessible to all classes who may require its aid. The voluntary
hospitals, on the contrary, have grown up without any comprehensive
plan of the districts or any real regard to the convenience
or necessities of their poorer inhabitants. Voluntary
hospital sites were almost invariably selected to suit the convenience
of the honorary medical staff and the general convenience
of the hospital economy rather than to save the patients
and their friends long journeys in search of medical aid. The
best of the municipal systems too enables economy to be enforced
in the administration by a plan which provides a central
office in every town where the number of vacant beds in each
hospital is known, so that the average of occupied beds in all
the hospitals can be well maintained from an economical point
of view. This speedy and ready inter-communication between
all hospitals in a great city, which might perfectly well be secured
under the voluntary system if the managers could only be brought
into active co-operation, prevents delay in the admission of urgent
cases, promotes the absence of waste by keeping the average of
beds occupied in each establishment high and uniform, and has
often proved a real gain to the poor by the diminution in cost to
the patients and their friends, who under the best municipal
systems can find a hospital within reasonable distance of their
home in a large city wherever it may be placed. Another
advantage of the municipal system should be that central control
makes for economical administration. Unfortunately a close
study of this question tends to prove that municipal hospitals
for the most part have resulted in a dead monotony of relative
inefficiency, often entailing great extravagance in buildings, and
accompanied by much waste in many directions. Existing
municipal hospital systems are attended by several grave
disadvantages. The administration shows a tendency to lag
and grow sleepy and inert. The absence of competition, and the
freedom from continuous publicity and criticism such as the
voluntary hospitals enjoy, make for inefficiency and indifferent
work. Rate-supported hospitals, as a rule, are administered by
permanent officials who reside in houses usually situated on
the hospital sites, and who are paid salaries which attract the
younger men, who, once appointed, tend to continue in office
for a long period of years. This fixture of tenure is apt to cause
a decline in the general interest in the work of the municipal
hospital, due mainly to the absence of a continuous criticism
from outside, and so the average of efficiency, both in regard to
treatment and other important matters, may become lower
and lower. Those who have habitually inspected great rate-supported
hospitals must have met instances over and over
again where a gentleman who has held office for twenty or thirty
years has frankly stated that his income is fixed, that his habits
have become crystallized, that he finds the work terribly monotonous,
and yet, as he hopes ultimately to retire upon a pension,
he has felt there was no course open to him but to continue in
office, even though he may feel conscientiously that a change
would be good for the patients, for the hospital and for himself.
Under the voluntary system evils of this kind are seldom or
never met with, nor have these latter establishments, within
living memory, ever been so conducted as to exhibit the grave
scandals which have marred the administration of rate-supported
hospitals not only in Great Britain but in other parts of the
world. We believe that the more thoroughly the advantages
and disadvantages of rate-supported and voluntary hospitals for
the care of the sick are weighed and considered, and the more
accurate and full the knowledge which is added to the judgment
upon which a decision can be based, the more certain will it be
that every capable administrator will come to the conclusion
that on the whole it is good for the sick and for the whole community
that these establishments should, at any rate in Great
Britain, be maintained upon the voluntary system. Of course
it is essential to have rate-supported hospitals where cases of
infectious disease and the poorest of the people who are dependent
largely upon the poor-law for their maintenance can be cared for.
It is satisfactory to be able to state that of late years the administration
of both these types of rate-supported hospitals has
greatly improved. The added importance now given all over
the country to medical officers of health, and the disposition
exhibited, both by parliament and government departments,
to make the position of these officers more important and
valuable than ever before, have tended largely to improve the
administrative efficiency of hospitals for infectious diseases. No
doubt the whole community would benefit if residents in every
part of the country could be moved to take a personal interest
in the infectious hospital in their immediate neighbourhood.
Amongst the smaller of these establishments there has been so
marked an inefficiency at times as to cause much avoidable
suffering. The existence of such inefficiency casts a grave
reflection upon the local authorities and others who are responsible
for the evils which undoubtedly exist in various places
at the present time. Unfortunately knowledge has not yet
sufficiently spread to enable the public to overcome its fear and
dread of infectious maladies. It is therefore very difficult to
induce people to take an active interest in one of these hospitals,
but we look forward to the time when, owing to the activity of
the medical officers of health who have immediate charge of
buildings of this kind, this difficulty may be overcome, when the
avoidable dangers and risks and the appalling discomfort which
a poor sufferer from a severe infectious disease in a rural district
may suddenly have to encounter under existing circumstances,
would be rendered impossible.

The poor-law infirmary in large cities, so far as the buildings
and equipment are concerned, very often leaves little to desire.
Poor-law infirmaries lack, however, the stimulus and the checks
and advantages which impartial criticism continuously applied
brings to a great voluntary hospital. Such disadvantages might
be entirely removed if parliament would decide to throw open
every poor-law infirmary for clinical purposes, and to have connected
with each such establishment a responsible visiting
medical staff, consisting of the best qualified men to be found in
the community which each hospital serves. The old prejudice
against hospital treatment has disappeared, for the least intelligent
members of the population now understand that, when
a citizen is sick, there is no place so good as the wards of a well-administered
hospital. Looking at the question of hospital
provision in Great Britain, and indeed in all countries at the
present time, it may be said, that there is everywhere evidence
of improvement and development upon the right lines, so that
never before in the history of the world has the lot of the sick
man or woman been so relatively fortunate and safe as it is in
794
the present day. Probably it is not too much to say that to-day
hospitals occupy the most important position in the social
economy of nations.

Classification of Hospitals.&mdash;Having dealt with hospitals as a
whole it may be well very briefly to classify them in groups, and
explain as tersely as possible what they represent and how far it
may be desirable to eliminate by consolidation or to increase by
disintegration the number of special hospitals.

General Hospitals.&mdash;These establishments consist of two kinds,
(a) clinical and (b) non-clinical, each of which, under the
modern system, should include every department of medicine
and surgery, and every appliance and means for the alleviation
of suffering, the healing of wounds, the reduction of fractures,
the removal of mal-formations and foreign growths, the surgical
restoration of damaged and diseased organs and bones, and
everything of every kind which experience and knowledge prove
to be necessary to the rapid cure of disease. The clinical hospital
means an institution to which a medical school is attached, where
technical instruction is given by able and qualified teachers to
medical students and others. A non-clinical hospital is one
which is not attached to a medical school, and where no medical
instruction is organized.

Special Hospitals.&mdash;Up to about 1840 the general hospital
was, speaking generally, the only hospital in existence. Twenty
years later, as the population increased and medical science
became more and more active, some of the more ardent members
of the medical profession, especially amongst the younger men,
pressed continuously for opportunities to develop the methods of
treatment in regard to special diseases for which neither accommodation
nor appliances were at that time forthcoming in general
hospitals. In a few cases, where the managers of the great
general hospitals were men of action and initiative special
departments were introduced, and an attempt was made to
make them efficient. The conservative spirit which, on the
whole, represents the British character for the most part, resulted,
however, in a steady resistance being offered by the older
members of the medical staffs and existing committees to the
advocates of special departments. In the result, especially as
such special departments as there were in connexion with general
hospitals were too often starved for want of means and men for
their development and improvement, the younger spirits called
their friends together and began to start special hospitals.
To-day every really efficient clinical general hospital has within
its walls special departments of almost every description, which
have been made as efficient and up-to-date as money and
knowledge can make them. Unfortunately the causes already
referred to led to the establishment of hundreds of the smaller
special hospitals, many of which were started in unsuitable
buildings, and some of which have ever since maintained a
struggling existence. Others, on the contrary, through the
energy of their original promoters and the excellence of the work
they have done, have obtained a position of authority and
reputation which has had a very important bearing for good
upon the development of medical science in the treatment of
disease. If the world had to-day to organize the very best
system of hospital accommodation which could be evolved,
there is no doubt that few or none of the special hospitals would
find any place in that system. As matters stand, however,
the special hospital has had to be accepted, and nothing which
King Edward&rsquo;s Hospital Fund has done in London has met with
greater popularity and professional approval than the labours
which its council have undertaken in promoting the amalgamation
of the smaller special hospitals of certain kinds, so as to secure
the provision of one really efficient special hospital for each
speciality. No doubt this policy of amalgamation will be steadily
pursued, and in the course of years every great city will gradually
reorganize its hospital methods so as to secure that, whether the
patients are treated in a general hospital or in a special hospital,
the average efficiency in every institution shall be as high and
as good as possible.


We will take now the special hospitals in detail.

Cancer Hospitals.&mdash;The justification for efficient cancer hospitals
must be found in the circumstance that most scientific men of
experience believe that, if adequate resources were placed at the
disposal of the medical profession, the origin of cancer might be
discovered, and so the human race would be freed from one of the
most awful diseases which affect humanity. Pending such a discovery
the experience of the cancer department connected with the
Middlesex Hospital in London proves to demonstration that the
provision of adequate and special accommodation for the exclusive
treatment of cases of cancer is not only desirable but necessary on
humanitarian grounds alone.

Hospitals for Consumption.&mdash;For many years it was held that this
group of hospitals was not a necessity, and the patients were treated
in the ordinary medical wards of the general hospitals. Since the
contagious character of tuberculosis became known, and improved
methods of treatment have been developed, every one agrees that
this type of special hospital is desirable, though it is believed by the
more advanced school of scientists that before long it may be happily
rendered obsolete owing to the discovery of methods of treatment
which will stay the disease at its commencement and restore the
patient to health.

Children&rsquo;s Hospitals.&mdash;These hospitals were very much opposed
at the outset. There can be no doubt that the children&rsquo;s ward or
wards in a big voluntary hospital is a most valuable asset to the
managers, so long as the children are treated in separate wards.
There is no reason of course why a hospital should confine its work
to the treatment of children, exclusively. Still this special hospital
is popular with the public; it has led to many discoveries and
developments in the treatment of children&rsquo;s diseases; on the whole
the administration of these establishments has been good; and we
believe they will continue to flourish, however many children&rsquo;s
wards may be provided in general hospitals. Children&rsquo;s hospitals
with country branches for the treatment of chronic ailments, such
as hip disease, are a valuable addition to the relief of suffering in
cities.

Cottage Hospitals.&mdash;These hospitals, established originally in
1859 by Mr Albert Napper at Cranleigh, Surrey, have fulfilled a
most useful function. Many of them are very efficient both in
regard to equipment and treatment. They have become essential
to the well-being and adequate medical care of rural populations,
as they attract to the country some of the best members of the profession,
who are able, with the aid of the cottage hospital, to keep
themselves efficient and up-to-date, so that all classes of the community
are benefited in this way by this type of hospital.

Ear, Throat and Nose Hospitals.&mdash;The history of this type of
hospital bears out in every particular the reason we have given
above for the establishment of special hospitals in the first instance.
There can be no doubt that the best conducted throat hospitals
have been beneficial to the poorer inhabitants of great cities.

Fever Hospitals.&mdash;Incidentally we have dealt with these institutions,
which are usually supported out of the rates and administered
by the medical officers of health, who are paid by the county or
municipal authorities.

Maternity and Lying-in Hospitals.&mdash;This is one of the oldest
types of special hospitals, and has done a great deal of good in its
time. Owing to modern methods of treatment and hygienic developments
the maternity hospital never occupied a stronger position
than it does to-day.

Mental Hospitals.&mdash;In Great Britain the insane are provided for
in asylums (see Insanity, ad fin.), though such establishments, if
properly conducted, are essentially hospitals. Scientific and public
opinion tend towards the establishment of mental hospitals to
which all acute cases of mental disease should be first relegated for
treatment and diagnosis before they are consigned to a permanent
lunatic hospital. Too little attention on an organized plan has
been given to the continuous study of mental disease in its clinical
and pathological aspects. It is probable, therefore, that the advent
of the mental hospital may lead to important developments in
treatment in many ways.

Ophthalmic Hospitals.&mdash;Of all special hospitals this is one which
would probably be the least necessary, providing general hospitals
everywhere were properly equipped and organized. No special
hospital has probably been so abused in the material sense by the
free relief of patients who could well afford to pay for their treatment
at the ophthalmic hospital. Several of the existing ophthalmic
hospitals have entailed an enormous expenditure, and their modern
equipment is wonderfully efficient.

Orthopaedic Hospitals.&mdash;It is very doubtful whether this type o£
hospital is really desirable or necessary. Its necessity may be
advocated on the ground that orthopaedic cases may require prolonged
treatment, and that the pressure upon the beds of general
hospitals by acute cases is nowadays so great as to render the
orthopaedic hospital more necessary than ever before.

Paralysis and Epileptic Hospitals.&mdash;Seeing that the percentage
of those who are at present attacked by paralysis and nervous disease
shows a continued tendency to increase under modern conditions of
life in large cities, hospitals of this type are necessary, and London
at any rate, like most foreign towns of importance, possesses, at
present, far too little accommodation for this class of case.

Skin and Photo-Therapy.&mdash;Up to the end of the 19th century
hospitals for diseases of the skin were a constant cause of scandal and
criticism. The introduction of modern methods of treatment by
795
light and electricity, including photo-therapy, has given an importance
to this department and treatment which it did not previously
possess. We are of opinion that, on the whole, it is better and
more economical to treat these cases in properly equipped departments
of general hospitals than in separate institutions.

Women&rsquo;s Hospitals.&mdash;These hospitals are not absolutely necessary,
but considering their popularity with the women themselves, and
that several of them have done excellent work, remembering too
that women constitute the majority of the population, there seems
to be some reason for their continuance.


The Evolution of the Modern Hospital.&mdash;The evolution of
the modern hospital affords one of the most marvellous evidences
of the advance of scientific and humanitarian principles which
the world has ever seen. At the outset hospitals were probably
founded by the healthy more for their own comfort than out of
any regard for the sick. Nowadays the healthy, whilst they
realize that the more efficient they can make the hospital,
the more certain, in the human sense, is their own chance of
prolonged life and health, are, as the progress of the League
of Mercy has shown in recent years, genuinely anxious for the
most part to do something as individuals in the days of health
in the cause of the sick. Formerly the hospital was merely
a building or buildings, very often unsuitable for the purposes
to which it was put, where sick and injured people were retained
and more frequently than not died. In other words the hygienic
condition, the methods of treatment and the hospital atmosphere
were all so relatively unsatisfactory as to yield a mortality
in serious cases of 40%. Nowadays, despite, or possibly
because of, the fact that operative interference is the rule rather
than the exception in the treatment of hospital patients, and in
consequence of the introduction of antiseptic and aseptic methods,
the mortality in hospitals is, in all the circumstances, relatively
less, and probably materially less, than it is even amongst
patients who are attended in their own homes. Originally
hospitals were unsystematic, crowded, ill-organized necessities
which wise people refused to enter, if they had any voice in the
matter. At the present time in all large cities, and in crowded
communities in civilized countries, great hospitals have been
erected upon extensive sites which are so planned as to constitute
in fact a village with many hundreds of inhabitants.
This type of modern hospital has common characteristics.
A multitude of separate buildings are dotted over the site,
which may cover 20 acres or upwards. In one such institution,
within an area of 20 acres, there are 6 m. of
drains, 29 m. of water and steam pipes, 3 m. of roof
gutters, 42 m. of electric wires, and 42 separate buildings,
which to all intents and purposes constitute a series of
distinct, isolated hospitals, in no case containing more than
forty-six patients. On the continent of Europe buildings of
this class are usually of one storey; in the United States,
owing to the difficulty of obtaining suitable sites and for
reasons of economy, some competent authorities strenuously
advocate high buildings with many storeys for town hospitals.
In England the majority have two to three storeys each, the
ward unit containing a ward for twenty beds and two
isolation wards for one and two beds respectively. The two
storeys in modern fever hospitals, however, are absolutely
distinct&mdash;that is, there is no internal staircase going from one
ward to the others, for each is entered separately from the
outside. This system carries to its extreme limits the principle
of separating the patients as much as possible into small groups;
the acute cases are usually treated in the upper ward, and
as they become convalescent are removed downstairs. In
this way the necessity for an entirely separate convalescent
block is done away with and the patients are kept under the
same charge nurse, an arrangement which promotes necessary
discipline. The unit of these hospitals is the pavilion, not the
ward, and consists of an acute ward, a convalescent ward,
separation wards, nurses&rsquo; duty rooms, store-rooms for linen,
an open-air balcony upstairs into which beds can be wheeled
in suitable weather, and a large airing-ground for convalescent
patients directly accessible from the downstairs ward. Each
of the pavilions is raised above the ground level, so that air
can circulate freely underneath. The wall, floor and air spaces
in the scarlet fever wards of one of these hospitals are respectively
12 ft., 156 ft. and 2028 ft. per bed; and in the enteric and
diphtheria wards they have been increased to 15 ft., 195 ft.
and 2535 ft. respectively. The provision of so large a floor
and linear space, especially in the diphtheria wards, is an experiment
the effect of which will be watched with considerable
interest. A building of this type is a splendid example of the
separate pavilion hospital, and is doing great service in the
treatment of fevers wherever it has been introduced. Some
idea of a hospital village, some of the wards of which we have
been describing, may be gathered from the circumstances
that it costs from £300,000 to £400,000, that it usually contains
from 500 to 700 beds, and that the staff numbers from 350 to
500 persons. The medical superintendent lives in a separate
house of his own. The nurses are provided with a home, consisting
of several blocks of buildings under the control of the
matron; the charge nurses usually occupy the main block;
where the dining and general sitting-rooms are placed; the
day assistant-nurses another block; and lastly, by a most
excellent arrangement, the night nurses, 80 to 120 in number,
have one whole block entirely given up to their use. The female
servants have a second home under the control of the housekeeper,
and the male servants occupy a third home under the
supervision of the steward. The two main ideas aimed at are
to disconnect the houses occupied by the staff from the infected
area, and to place the members of each division of the staff
together, but in separate buildings, under their respective heads.
These objects are highly to be commended, as they have important
bearings upon the well-being and discipline of the whole establishment
and constitute a lesson for all who have to do with buildings
where a great number of people are constantly employed.

The Hospital City.&mdash;We have shown that the modern hospital
where an adequate site is available under the most favourable
conditions has developed into a hospital village. No one who
is familiar with the existing disadvantages of many of the
sites and their surroundings of town hospitals in many a large
city can have any doubt that, if the well-being of the patients
and the good of the whole community, combined with economical
and administrative reasons, together with the provision of an
adequate system for the instruction and training of medical
students and nurses, are to be the first considerations with
those responsible for the hospitals of the future, the time will
come, and is probably not far distant, when each great urban
community will provide for the whole of its sick by removing
them to a hospital city, which will be situated upon a specially
selected and most salubrious site some distance from the town
itself. The atmosphere of a great city grows less and less suitable
to the rapid and complete recovery of patients who may undergo
the major operations or be suffering from the severe and acute
forms of disease. Asepsis, it is true, has reduced the average
residence in hospital from about 35 to less than 20 days. It
has thereby added quite one million working days each year
to the earning power of the artisan classes in London alone.
Medical opinion is more and more favouring the provision of
convalescent and suburban hospitals, to which patients suffering
from open wounds may be removed from the city hospitals.
This course, which entails much additional expenditure, is
advocated to overcome the difficulty arising from the fact
that, in operation and other cases, the patients cease to continue
to make rapid progress towards recovery after the seventh
or ninth day&rsquo;s residence in a city hospital. A change of such
cases to the country restores the balance and completes the
recovery with a rapidity often remarkable.

Thinking out the problem here presented in all its bearings,
realizing the great and ever-increasing cost of sites for hospitals
in great cities, the heavy consequential taxes and charges which
they have to meet there, and all the attendant disadvantages
and drawbacks, the present writer has ventured upon an anticipation
which he hopes may prove intelligent and well-founded.
Nearly every difficulty in regard to the cost of hospitals and
in respect to all the many problems presented by securing
796
the material required, under present systems, for the efficient
training of students and nurses, would be removed by the
erection of the Hospital City, which, he foresees, must ultimately
be recognized by intelligent communities throughout the
civilized world. Why should we not have, on a carefully selected
site well away from the contaminations of the town, and
adequately provided with every requisite demanded from the
site of the most perfect modern hospital which the mind of
man can conceive, a &ldquo;Hospital City&rdquo;? Here would be concentrated
all the means for relieving and treating every form
of disease to the abiding comfort of all responsible for their
adequacy and success. At the present time all the traffic and all
the citizens give way to fire engines and the ambulance in the
public streets. Necessarily the means of transit to and from
the &ldquo;Hospital City,&rdquo; and its rapidity, would be the most perfect
in the world. So the members of the medical staff, the friends
of the patients, and all who had business in the &ldquo;Hospital
City,&rdquo; would find it easier and less exacting in time and energy
to be attached to one of the hospitals located therein than to
one situated in the centre of a big population in a crowded town.
To meet the urgent and accident cases a few receiving houses,
or outpost relief stations, with a couple of wards, would be
situated in various quarters of the working city, where patients
could be temporarily treated, and whence they could be removed
to the &ldquo;Hospital City&rdquo; by an efficient motor ambulance service.
The writer can see such a &ldquo;Hospital City&rdquo; established, can
realize the comfort it will prove in practice to the medical profession,
to the patients&rsquo; friends, to those who have to manage
the hospitals and train the medical and nursing students, and
indeed to all who may go there as well as to the whole community.
The initial cost of hospital buildings should be reduced at
once to a quarter or less of the present outlay. They could
then be built of the cheapest but most suitable material, which
would have many advantages, whilst the actual money forthcoming
from the realization and sale of the existing hospital sites
in many cities would, in all probability, produce a sum which in
the whole might prove adequate, or nearly adequate, or even in
some cases more than adequate, to defray the entire cost of
building the &ldquo;Hospital City&rdquo; and of equipping it too. The
cost of administration and working must be everywhere reduced
to a minimum. The hygienic completeness of the whole city,
its buildings and appliances, must expedite recovery to the
maximum extent. In all probability the removal of the sick
from contact with the healthy would tend in practice so to
increase the healthiness of the town population, i.e. of the
workers of the city proper, as to free them from some of the
most burdensome trials which now cripple their resources and
diminish materially the happiness of their lives. Probably
the United States (where a city has sometimes sprung up in
twelve months) may be the home where this idea may first
find its realization in accomplished fact. The writer may
never live to see such a city in actual working or in its entirety,
but he makes bold to believe its adoption will one day solve
the more difficult of the problems involved in providing adequately
for the sick in crowded communities. He has formulated
the idea because it seems desirable to encourage discussion as
to the best method of checking the growing tendency to make
hospital buildings everywhere too costly. If the idea of the
&ldquo;Hospital City&rdquo; commends itself to the profession and the
public, the practice of treating all the hospital accommodation
in each city as a whole will gradually increase and spread,
until most of the present pressing difficulties may disappear
altogether. That is a consummation devoutly to be wished.

The Problem of Hospital Administration.&mdash;A study of the
hospital problem in various countries, and especially in different
portions of the English-speaking world, convinces the writer
that, apart from local differences, the features presented are
everywhere practically identical. A number of hospitals under
independent administration, dependent in whole or in part
on voluntary contributions, administered under different regulations
originally representing the idiosyncracies of individual
managers for the time being, without any standard of efficiency
or any system of co-operation, which would bring the whole
of the medical establishments of each or all of the great cities
of the world under one administration which the combined
wisdom and experience of hospital managers as a whole might
agree to be the best, must mean in practice a material gain in
every way to each and all of the hospitals and their supporters
on economical, scientific and other grounds. Such an absence of
system throughout the world has everywhere led to overlapping,
to the perpetuation of many abuses, to the admission of an
increasing number of patients whose social position does not
entitle them to claim free medical relief at all, and, often too,
to the admission of patients belonging to a humbler grade of
society who are already provided for by the rates in institutions
which they do not care to enter and who find their way to the
wards of hospitals which were established to provide for patients
of an entirely different social grade. These evils have continued
to grow and increase almost everywhere, despite many and
varied attempts to grapple with and remove them. Amongst
these attempts we may mention the assembling of hospital
conferences, the establishment of special funds and committees,
and the holding of inquiries of various kinds in London and
other British cities and also in the United States. The most
remarkable proof of the impossibility of inducing those responsible
to act together and enforce the necessary reforms is
afforded by the historical fact that the famous Commission on
Hospital Abuse, known as Sir William Fergusson&rsquo;s Commission,
in 1871, after an exhaustive inquiry, made the following recommendations:
(1) to improve the administration of poor-law
medical relief; (2) to place all free dispensaries under the control
of the poor-law authorities; (3) to establish an adequate system
of provident dispensaries; (4) to curtail the unrestricted system
of gratuitous relief, partly by the selection of cases possessing
special clinical interest and partly by the exclusion of those
who on social grounds are not entitled to gratuitous medical
advice; (5) the payment of the medical staff engaged in both
in- and out-patient work, and the payment of fees by patients
in the pay wards and in the consultation departments of
the voluntary hospitals. Other commissions have since been
appointed, have reported, and have disappeared, with the result
that nothing practical had been done up to 1910 in the way of
reform. Yet it is an undoubted fact that, if the foregoing recommendations
of Sir William Fergusson&rsquo;s Commission had
been carried out in their entirety at the time they were made,
practically all the abuses from which British hospitals afterwards
suffered would have been removed, and the charitable public
might have been saved several millions of pounds sterling.
It may be well, therefore, briefly to indicate exactly what these
changes amount to, and how they can be made effective at
any time by those responsible for the working of a hospital.

There is no doubt that all the facts available tend to prove that
the voluntary hospitals are used to an increasing extent by persons
able to make payment or partial payment for the treatment
which they receive. The evidence and statistics demonstrating
these facts may be readily gathered from a study of the Report
(1909) and Evidence of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws
and Relief of Distress (Lord George Hamilton&rsquo;s Commission)
and in the authorities mentioned at the end of this article. The
underlying cause of the abuse was that no means existed whereby
persons of moderate income could obtain efficient treatment
and hospital care when ill at a rate which they could afford to
pay. The system, or want of system, whereby medical relief is
granted to practically all applicants by the voluntary hospitals
grew up without any combined attempt to organize it efficiently
or to check abuses. Such a system rests upon a wrong basis, and
the best interests of every class of the population demand its
abolition in favour of one which shall afford the maximum of
justice (1) to the poor, (2) to those who can afford to pay in part
or in whole the cost of their medical treatment and care at a
hospital, (3) to the medical profession, (4) to the subscribers and
supporters of voluntary hospitals, whose gifts should be strictly
applied to the purposes they were intended to serve, and (5)
to the ratepayers, who are entitled to a guarantee that the
797
maximum efficiency is secured by the poor-law system of
medical relief. The remedy is very simple and easy of application.
Every voluntary hospital, while admitting all accidents and
urgent cases needing immediate attention, should institute a
system whereby each applicant would be asked to prove that
he or she was a fit object of charity. The only real attempt
at reform, up to 1909, was the appointment by many of the larger
hospitals of almoners to ascertain whether certain selected
patients were in a position to pay or not. By putting the burden
of proof of eligibility to receive free medical relief upon the
patients and their friends, all abuse of every kind must speedily
cease. There would be no hardship entailed upon the patients by
such a system, as experience has proved, but, to make it effective,
the system of providing for in- and out-patients in Great Britain
requires radical change, for, in existing circumstance, if a
voluntary hospital attempted to enforce this simple method, it
would be met with the difficulty that, where it was found that
a patient or his friends could pay at any rate something, no
department connected with British hospitals existed&mdash;as is the
case in regard to hospitals in the United States&mdash;enabling such
in-patients to be transferred to accommodation provided in
paying wards. In the same way, directly the out-patients
were dealt with under such a system, it would be made apparent,
where a case could be properly treated, under the poor law,
that no plan of co-operation to secure this was organized under
existing conditions. If the patient, being of a better class, were
suffering from a minor ailment, and could be properly dealt with
at a provident dispensary, the fees of which he could easily
pay, the same absence of co-operation must make it practically
impossible readily to enforce the system. When, again, an out-patient
of the better class was entitled, from the severity of his
ailment, to receive the advantages of a consultation by the
medical staff, no method existed whereby this aid could be
rendered to him, and his transfer afterwards to the care of a
medical practitioner attached to some provident dispensary,
or resident near the patient&rsquo;s home, could be properly carried
out. It follows that adequate reform required that methods
should be adopted with a view to some part or all the cost of
treatment being provided by the patient or his friends through
an entire reorganization of the system of medical relief not only
at the voluntary hospitals, but under the poor-law system. The
reforms required in regard to voluntary hospitals are that every
large hospital shall have connected with the in-patient department,
in separate buildings, but under the administration of
the managers, pay wards for the reception of those patients who
are able to pay some part or all of the cost of treatment; that,
as regards out-patients, the existing out-patient department
should be abolished; that in substitution for it each hospital
should have a casualty department and a department for
consultation. In the casualty department every applicant
should be seen once, and be there disposed of by being handed on
to the consultation department; if his case was sufficiently
important, he should then be transferred to some provident
or poor-law dispensary, or be referred to a private medical
attendant. It would no doubt take time to overcome the incidental
difficulties which would necessarily arise in effecting
so radical a reform as is here contemplated, but if all voluntary
hospitals adopted the same system, and were to be brought into
active co-operation with provident dispensaries and poor-law
dispensaries and private medical practitioners, the new system
might be successfully introduced and made effective within
twelve months, and probably within six months, from the date
of its commencement. This opinion is based upon the assumption
that the provident dispensaries would be standardized,
and that every one of them would be brought up to a state of the
highest efficiency. In the town of Northampton the Royal
Victoria Dispensary has been worked with the maximum of
success, so far as the patients and the medical practitioners are
concerned. In London and in other large towns like Manchester
and elsewhere the provident dispensary has not succeeded as
it has done in Northampton, because so many members of the
medical profession are not alive to the importance of making
it their first business to provide that every patient connected
with the provident dispensary who attends at the surgery of a
private medical practitioner shall receive at least equal attention
and accommodation to that afforded to every other private
patient, whatever the fee he may pay. In the same way, poor-law
dispensaries must be radically reformed. Everything which
tends to excite a feeling of shame on the part of the patient
attending the poor-law dispensary, such as the printing of the
word &ldquo;pauper&rdquo; at the beginning of the space on which the
patient&rsquo;s name is entered, must be abolished, and the class of
medical service and all the arrangements for the treatment
of the patients, however poor, at the poor-law dispensary,
must be made at least as efficient as those provided by voluntary
hospitals. There undoubtedly is considerable overlapping
between the voluntary hospitals and the poor law in Great
Britain. The Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief
of Distress (1909) deals with this point with a view to set up a
standard of medical relief to be granted by each class and type
of hospitals, provides for adequate co-operation between all
classes of institutions; and these reforms may be commended.
It is too often forgotten that the function of the poor law is the
relief of destitution, while it should be the object and duty of
each voluntary hospital and indeed of all hospitals other than
poor-law institutions to apply their resources entirely to the
prevention of destitution, by stepping in to grant free medical
relief to the provident and thrifty when, through no fault of
their own, they meet with an accident or are overtaken by
disease. An adequate system of co-operation would preserve
the privilege of the voluntary hospitals, which save such patients
from the necessity of requiring the relief which it is the object
of the poor law to supply.

We have dealt with the relative advantages and disadvantages
of rate-supported hospitals and voluntary hospitals. We
should regard the establishment of a complete state-provided or
rate-provided system of gratuitous medical relief, either for indoor
patients or for out-door patients, or for both, as a grave evil.
Such a system must eventually lead to the extinction of voluntary
hospitals. If this disaster ever happens, it must result in the
gravest evils, for it could not fail to injure the morale of all
classes and tend to harden unnecessarily the relations between
the rich and poor, who, under the voluntary system, have come
to share each other&rsquo;s sufferings and to be animated by respect and
confidence towards each other.


Hospital Construction. Locality and Site.&mdash;Hospitals are required
for the use of the community in a certain locality, and to be of use
they must be within reach of the centre of population. Formerly
the greater difficulty of locomotion made it necessary that they
should be actually in the midst of towns and cities, and to some
extent this continues to prevail. It is now proved to demonstration
that this is not the best plan. Fresh and pure air being a prime
necessity, as well as a considerable amount of space of actual area in
proportion to population, it would certainly be better to place
hospitals as much in the outskirts as is consistent with considerations
of usefulness and convenience. In short, the best site would be open
fields; but if that be impracticable, a large space, &ldquo;a sanitary
zone&rdquo; as it is called by Tollet, should be kept permanently free
between them and surrounding buildings, certainly never less than
double the height of the highest building. In the selection of a site
various factors must be taken into consideration. If the hospital
is to be used as the clinical school of a university or medical college,
then the most suitable ground available within easy reach of the
university or college must be secured. If, on the other hand, the
hospital is not to be used as a teaching school, a site more in the
country should be favoured. In any case ample ground must be
purchased to permit of the wards receiving the maximum of sunlight,
an abundant supply of fresh air, and leave room for possible
future extensions. The site should be self-contained; it should be
in such a position as to prevent the hospital being shadowed by
other buildings in the neighbourhood, and, unless the site is alongside
a public park, it should be entirely surrounded by streets of
from 40 to 60 ft. in width. It is also necessary to secure that adequate
water mains serve the site, and that the system of sewers be
ample for all sewage purposes.

The difference between the expense of purchase of land in a town
and in the environs is generally considerable, and this is therefore
an additional reason for choosing a suburban locality. Even with
existing hospitals it would be in most cases pecuniarily advantageous
to dispose of the present building and site and retain only a receiving
house in the town. St Thomas&rsquo;s in London, the Hôtel-Dieu in Paris
798
and the Royal Infirmary in Manchester, are all good examples
where this might have been carried out. In none, however, has this
been done; these hospitals have been rebuilt, at enormous outlay,
in the cities as before, although not exactly in the same locality.

As regards the actual site itself, where circumstances admit of
choice, a dry gravelly or sandy soil should be selected, in a position
where the ground water is low and but little subject to fluctuations
of level, and where the means of drainage are capable of being
effectually carried out. There should also be a cheerful sunny
aspect and some protection from the coldest winds.

Form of Building.&mdash;A form of building must be selected which
answers the following conditions: (a) the freest possible circulation
of air round each ward, with no cul-de-sac or enclosed spaces where
air can stagnate; (b) free play of sunlight upon each ward during
some portion at least of the day; (c) the possibility of isolating any
ward, or group of wards, effectually, in case of infectious disease
breaking out; (d) the possibility of ventilating every ward independently
of any other part of the establishment. Those conditions
can only be fulfilled by one system, viz. a congeries of houses or
pavilions, more or less connected with each other by covered ways,
so as to facilitate convenient and economical administration. The
older plans of huge blocks of buildings, arranged in squares or
rectangles, enclosing spaces without free circulation of air, are
obviously objectionable. Even when arranged in single lines or
crosses they are not desirable, as the wards either communicate
with each other or with common passages or corridors, rendering
separation impossible. On this point it may be remarked that
some of the buildings of the 18th century were more wisely constructed
than many of those in the first half of the 19th century,
and that the older buildings have been from time to time spoilt by
ignorant additions made in later times.

The question next arises, is it better to have pavilions of two or
more storeys high, or to have single-storeyed huts or cottages
scattered more widely? For the treatment of tuberculosis there
can be no doubt that, for hygienic reasons, the châlet or single-patient
hut is the best for the patients in the acute stages; for
economical reasons the châlet has not been heretofore as popular as
it deserves to be, but if the welfare of the patient is to be the first
consideration there is no doubt that the châlet will ultimately prevail.
It has the merit of being easily adapted to villages and houses
where there is a garden, and in this way poor families may readily
isolate and treat a member affected by tuberculosis at a cost within
their means. For hospital purposes, so long as the system of placing
hospital buildings in densely crowded areas prevails, many-storeyed
buildings for hospital purposes are likely to continue. Should the
proposal to institute a Hospital City ultimately prevail, then it is
probable that the majority of the pavilions will be single-storeyed.
Still some hospital authorities prefer the multiple-storeyed system
for administrative reasons, contending that single-storeyed pavilions
have no special advantages over two or three-storeyed buildings,
whereas the difficulties in administration and service of a hospital
building on the single-storey principle outweigh any argument
against the two- or three-storey building, if it is properly designed
and constructed. We hope that the time is approaching when
architects and those members of the public who have to provide
the money for hospital buildings will insist upon the erection of
simple structures, costing little, so that the whole cost of hospital
buildings may be, as it ought to be, reduced by at least half when
compared with the expenditure of the past.

The pavilions may be arranged in various ways; they may be
joined at one end by a corridor, or may be divided by a central
corridor at right angles to them. In fact, the plan is very elastic,
and adapts itself to almost any circumstances. A certain distance,
not less than twice the height of the pavilions, ought to be preserved
between them. By this means free circulation of air and
plenty of light are secured, whilst separation or isolation may be at
once accomplished if required.

Foundations, Building Materials, &amp;c.&mdash;It is of the first consequence
that a hospital should be dry; therefore the foundation and walls
ought to be constructed so as to prevent the inroads of damp. An
impervious foundation has the further advantage of preventing
emanations from the soil rising up in consequence of the suction
force produced by the higher temperature of the internal atmosphere
of the building itself. There should be free ventilation in the basement,
and the raising of the whole on arches is a good plan, now
generally carried out in hot climates. If the pavilions are two or
more storeys high, it is advisable to use fire-proof material as much
as possible, but single-storeyed huts may be of wood. In any case
effectual means of excluding damp must be employed. The interiors
of wards ought to be rendered as non-absorbent as possible,
by being covered with impervious coatings, such as glazed tiles
(Parian, though much used, is apt to crack), silicate paint, which is
preferable to tiles, or the like. The ceilings ought to be treated in
the same way as the walls. There must be a concrete floor between
each flat, experience showing that if a teak floor is laid hard on the
concrete a very noisy floor is the result, but if the teak is laid on
strips of wood, leaving a small space between the concrete and the
floor, a more silent floor is obtained. For the floors themselves
various materials have been suggested: in France there is a preference
for flags (dalles), but in England wood is more liked; and
indeed hard well-fitting wood, such as teak, oak or American willow,
leaves nothing to be desired. The surface should be waxed and
polished or varnished. Even deal floors can be rendered non-absorbent
by waxing, by impregnating them with solid paraffin
as recommended by Dr Langstaff.

Shape and Arrangement of Wards.&mdash;It is now generally agreed that
wards should have windows on at least two opposite sides. Three
main shapes have been proposed: (a) long wards with windows
down each side, and (generally) one at the farther end with balcony;
26 ft. is a good width for a ward of twelve or fourteen beds, but for
larger wards of more than fourteen beds the width should be not less
than 28 ft.; (b) wards nearly square, with windows on three sides;
and (c) circular wards with windows all round. The first (a) is the
form usually adopted in pavilions; (b) is recommended by Dr C. F.
Folsom (Plans for the Johns Hopkins Hospital); and (c) has been
suggested by Mr John Marshall, F.R.S. (Nat. Assoc. for Promotion
of Social Science, 1878). Of these (b) seems the least to be commended,
and (c), now comparatively common, has distinct advantages
in an administrative sense, when the wards are constructed
as to floor space so as to allow the same proportion of superficial
space per bed in a circular ward to that which is contained in a
rectangular ward, as is the case at the Great Northern Central
Hospital, London. Some authorities object to a chimney-stack up
the centre of the circular ward, urging that it prevents the nurses
from having complete supervision over all the beds. In practice
this objection seems to us to have little force, and it can be avoided
by placing the fireplaces at the side of the circular ward, if desirable,
though this adds somewhat to the cost of building.

Each bed should be a little distance, say from 8 in. to 1 ft. from the
wall, and each bed may be reckoned as 6½ ft. long; this gives 7½ ft. on
each side. Between the ends of the beds about 10 ft. space is necessary,
so that 25 or 26 ft. of total breadth may be taken as a favourable
width. The wards of the Herbert Hospital are 26 ft.; but some
exceed this, as, for instance, St Thomas&rsquo;s, London, and the New
Royal infirmary, Edinburgh, 28; new Hôtel Dieu, 29; and Lariboisière,
30. There seems no necessity for exceeding 26 for a ward of
twelve or fourteen beds, but if the breadth be greater there ought
to be more window space&mdash;the great difficulty being to get a wide
space thoroughly ventilated. There ought to be only two rows of
beds, one down each wall, with a window on each side of each bed.

For ventilation two things are required&mdash;sufficient space and
sufficiently frequent change or renewal of air. As regards space,
this must be considered with reference both to total space and to
lateral or floor space. Unless a minimum of floor space be laid
down, we shall always be in danger of overcrowding, for cubic space
may be supplied vertically with little or no advantage to the occupier.
If we allow a minimum distance of 4 ft. between the beds and 10 ft.
between the ends of the beds, this gives 100 sq. ft. of space per
bed; less than this is undesirable. In severe surgical cases, fever
cases and the like, a much larger space is required; and in the
Edinburgh Infirmary 150 sq. ft. is allowed. Cubic space must be
regulated by the means of ventilation; we can rarely change the
air oftener than three times in an hour, and therefore the space
ought to be at least one-third of the hourly supply. This ought not
to be less than 4000 cubic ft. per bed, even in ordinary cases of sickness&mdash;and
the third of that is 1333 cubic ft. of space. With 100 sq. ft.
of floor space a ward of 13½ ft. high would supply this amount, and
there is but little to be gained by raising the ceiling higher,&mdash;indeed
12 ft. is practically enough. The experiments of Drs Cowles and
Wood of Boston (see Report of State Board of Health of Massachusetts
for 1879) show that above 12 ft. there is little or no movement in the
air except towards the outlet ventilator; the space above is therefore
of little value as ventilation space. Authorities nowadays,
however, fix 10 ft. 6 in. as the maximum, and any height above this
may be disregarded for purposes of ventilation. Additional height
adds also to the cost of construction, increases the expense of warming,
makes cleaning more difficult, and to some extent hampers
ventilation. Whatever be the height of wards, the windows must
reach to the ceiling, or there must be ventilators in the ceiling or
at the top of the side walls. If this be not arranged for, a mass of
foul air is apt to stagnate near the ceiling, and sooner or later to be
driven down upon the inmates. The reasons for a large and constant
renewal of air are, of course, the immediate removal and dilution of
the organic matter given off by the inmates; as this is greater in
quantity and more offensive and dangerous in sickness than in
health, the change of air in the former case must be greater than in
the latter. Hence in serious cases an amount of air practically
unlimited is desirable&mdash;the aim of true ventilation being to approach
as near as possible to the condition of pure external air. Without
going too much into details, a few general rules may be laid down.
(1) Fresh air ought, if possible, to be brought in at the lowest part
of the ward, warmed if necessary; (2) foul air ought to be taken
out at the highest part of the ward; (3) fresh air should reach each
patient without passing over the bed of any other; (4) the vitiated
air should be removed from each patient without passing over the
bed of any other; (5) 4000 cubic ft. of fresh air per head per hour
should be the minimum in ordinary cases of sickness, to be increased
without limit in severer cases; (6) the air should move in no part of
a ward at a greater rate than 1½ ft. per second, except at the point
of entry, where it should not exceed 5 ft. per second, and at the
799
outlet, where the rate may be somewhat higher; about 64 sq. in.
of inlet and outlet sectional area ought to be supplied per head as a
minimum; (7) every opportunity ought to be taken of freely flushing
the wards with air, by means of open windows, when this can be
done with safety.

Warming is a question of great importance in most climates,
especially in such a climate as that of Great Britain, where every
system of ventilation must involve either the warming of some
portion of the incoming air, or the contriving its delivery without
too great lowering of temperature; at the same time it cannot be
too strongly insisted upon that the tendency is too much in the
direction of allowing warmth to supersede freshness of air. There
are very few cases of disease (if any) that are not more injured by
foul air than by low temperature; and in the zymotic diseases,
such as typhus, enteric fever, smallpox, &amp;c., satisfactory results
have been obtained even in winter weather by almost open-air
treatment. At the same time a reasonable warmth is desirable on
all grounds if it can be obtained without sacrificing purity of atmosphere.
For all practical purposes 60° to 63° F. is quite sufficient,
and surgical and lying-in cases do well in lower temperatures.
Various plans of warming have been recommended, but probably
a combination is the best. It is inadvisable to do away altogether
with radiant heat, although it is not always possible to supply
sufficient warmth with open-air fire-places alone. A portion of the
air may be warmed by being passed over a heating apparatus before
it enters the ward, by having an air-chamber round the fire-place
or stove, or by the use of radiators in the ward itself. In each case,
however, the air must be supplied independently to each ward, so
that no general system of air supply is applicable.

The lighting of the ward at night will be most conveniently done by
means of electricity in the form of a lamp for each bed, where gas
is used each jet should have a special ventilator to carry off combustion
products, as in the Edinburgh Infirmary.

The Furniture of Wards should be simple, clean and non-absorbent;
the bedsteads of iron, mattresses hair, laid on spring
bottoms without sacking. No curtains should be permitted.

The water-supply ought to be on the constant system, and plentiful;
50 gallons per head per diem may be taken as a fair minimum
estimate.

The closets ought to be of the simplest construction, the pans of
earthenware all in one piece, the flushing arrangements simple but
perfect, and the supply of water ample. Each ward should have its
own closets, lavatories, &amp;c., built in small annexes, with a cross-ventilated
vestibule separating them from the ward. All the pipes
should be disconnected from the drains, the closets by intercepting
traps, the sink and waste pipes by being made to pour their contents
over trapped gratings. The soil pipes should be ventilated, and
placed outside the walls, protected as may be necessary from frost.
Each ward should have a movable bath, which can be wheeled to
the patient&rsquo;s bedside.

Each ward should have attached to it a small kitchen for any
special cooking that may be required, a room for the physician or
surgeon, and generally a room with one or two separate beds. No
cooking should be done in the wards, nor ought washing, airing or
drying of linen to be allowed there.

Hospital Economics.&mdash;There is no doubt that the voluntary
system of hospital government is far more economical than any
system of state or rate-supported hospitals. That the present
condition of the voluntary hospitals in regard to economy is all
that can be wished is not, of course, true. Still, resting as this
system does upon the goodwill of the public for its continuance and
maintenance, it is satisfactory to note that there is a continuous
improvement in system and method, which makes for economy.
It has taken many years to perfect and enforce the uniform system
of hospital accounts, but this system with the co-operation of the
great funds has produced economical results of the first importance.
This system originated at the Queen&rsquo;s Hospital, Birmingham, in
1869, and was devised by an eminent Birmingham accountant,
William Laundy, and Sir Henry Burdett. It proved so fruitful in
practice that six years later it was introduced at the &ldquo;Dreadnought&rdquo;
Seamen&rsquo;s Hospital, the first London hospital to use it, and was then
adopted spontaneously by a few of the best-administered hospitals
where the managers were keen in enforcing economy. In 1891,
in order to secure for comparative purposes an identical classification
of the items and charges included in the system, a glossary or
index of classification was prepared and published in the Hospital
Annual of that year. This index enabled the same classification of
the many items included in the expenditure of a great institution to
be adopted generally. In the same year a committee of hospital
secretaries, at the instigation of the Metropolitan Hospital Sunday
Fund, revised and elaborated the index of classification, and the
new index was adopted by a general meeting of hospital secretaries
in January 1892. The Council of the Metropolitan Hospital Sunday
Fund approved it, and the Uniform System of Accounts was formulated
by that body for the use of the metropolitan hospitals.
In 1906 the whole of this system was inquired into on behalf of the
King&rsquo;s Fund by Mr John G. Griffiths, F.C.A., when a committee of
hospital secretaries and representatives of the King&rsquo;s Fund prepared
a further revision of the system. This was completed in the course
of the year and adopted by the King&rsquo;s, the Hospital Sunday and the
Hospital Saturday Funds. The publication of a book by Sir Henry
Burdett led to the adoption of the system in several of the British
Colonies, and as a result of the action taken in the British Empire
the Uniform System of Accounts has recently been set up and
adopted by the principal hospitals of the United States of America.
The prince of Wales (George V.) testified to the value of this system in
enforcing control over expenditure, and Sir Henry Burdett adapted
it for the use of the authorities of all charities of every class. It is
probable that no single reform has had a greater influence for good
upon the administration of charitable institutions than the evolution
and enforcement of the uniform system of accounts.

Nursing.&mdash;The arrangements for nursing the sick have greatly
improved in recent times, although controversy still goes on as to
the best method of carrying it out. In arranging for the nursing in
a hospital both efficiency and economy have to be considered. No
ward in a general hospital for acute cases should contain more than
24 beds. In hospitals with clinical schools the proportion of nurses
to patients should be about one nurse to every three patients, and
if possible every ward should have a probationer on duty at night in
addition to the night nurse. In all well-conducted hospitals it is
now arranged that the nurses on night duty have a hot meal served
in the general dining-room during the night, and this is only possible
where a nurse and a probationer are allowed for each ward. The
nurses&rsquo; quarters should be separate from the hospital proper, and
connected by a conservatory or covered way. Each nurse should
have a separate bedroom, measuring not less than 12 ft. long, 9 ft.
broad and 10 ft. high. A bath should be allowed for every eight
rooms, and the water-closets and sinks should, if possible, be in
sanitary towers cut off from the main block of buildings.

Circumstances must to a large extent determine the arrangement,
but it seems desirable on the whole that the work of a nurse should
be confined to a single ward at a time if possible. The duties of
nurses ought also to be distinctly confined to attendance on the sick,
and no menial work, such as scrubbing floors and the like, should
be demanded of them; a proper staff of servants ought to be employed
for such purposes. It is also desirable that a separate
pavilion for lodging the nurses should be set apart, and that fair and
reasonable time for rest and recreation should be allowed. Some
discussion has taken place as to the advisability of placing the
nursing of a hospital in the hands of a sisterhood or a separate
corporation. It will, however, be admitted that the best plan is
for the nursing staff of each hospital to be special and under one
head within the establishment itself, even though it may be connected
with some main institution outside. The nursing must, of
course, be carried on in accordance with the directions and treatment
of the physicians and surgeons.

General.&mdash;The kitchen, laundry, dispensary and other offices
must be in a separate pavilion or pavilions, away from the wards,
but within convenient access. A separate pavilion for isolation of
infectious cases is desirable. This may be a wooden hut, or in
some cases even a tent; either is probably preferable to a permanent
block of buildings. A disinfecting chamber ought to be
provided where heat can be applied to clothes and bedding, for the
destruction both of vermin and of the germs of disease. It is advisable
to expose all bedding and clothing to its influence after
each occasion of wear. Although this may entail additional expense
from the deterioration of fabric, it is worth the outlay to secure
immunity from disease. This plan is rigidly followed at the Royal
South Hants Infirmary at Southampton. It is of great importance
that the wards should be periodically emptied and kept unoccupied
for not less than one month in each year, and longer if possible.
During such period thorough cleansing and flushing with air could
be carried out, so as to prevent any continuous deposit of organic
matter.

Gate House or Admission Block.&mdash;If the efficiency of a hospital
and the regular and smooth working of its departments are to be
secured, the proper management and control of the admission
department is of the greatest importance. When one considers for
a moment the number of applicants of all ages in various stages of
disease, and the number of accident cases of every degree of severity
who present themselves every day seeking admission, it will be
evident that the most careful supervision must be exercised on the
very threshold. It is essential that every precaution be taken against
the admission of an unsuitable case, or the refusal, without careful
examination, of any patient seeking admission. It is only necessary
to instance the case of a patient with delirium tremens being admitted
to a general ward at a late hour, or a case of infectious disease
admitted through an overlook, or a case refused admission and
expiring on the way home, in order to illustrate the danger and
trouble which might arise should the supervision exercised over this
department not be systematic, stringent and thorough.

To secure this proper control it is necessary that the admission
department should be designed on a definite plan suitable for the
purposes in view. It is not sufficient to utilize any available rooms,
say, in the basement of the building, where patients may be casually
interviewed by a house surgeon or physician. This department
should be as carefully designed and equipped as any other department
of the hospital.

Within recent years much more attention has been devoted to
the details of construction than was formerly considered necessary,
800
but even in the best type of hospital there is still much to be desired
in this respect. It is essential for an architect in designing any
building to have before him an accurate idea of all the requirements,
and the use to which each foot of space is to be put; for unless he
is furnished with this information it is not possible for him to design
his building so as to give effect to all the details which are so necessary.
The following is an endeavour in a general way to enumerate
the various points which an architect should have before him in
designing the admission department of a general hospital:&mdash;

The admission department should be conveniently placed on the
ground floor of the hospital&mdash;or it may be a detached building&mdash;with
a large court where ambulance wagons or other vehicles may
easily pass each other on approaching or retiring from the institution.
The entrance to the admission department for patients should,
if possible, be entirely separate and distinct from that for the staff
and students. An additional entrance should be provided for
patients&rsquo; friends on visiting days, in order that they may be able
to enter the hospital without passing through the patients&rsquo; entrance,
or coming into contact with an accident case or other patient seeking
admission. The main entrance door should be protected by a
covered porch so that patients may be removed from the ambulance
or cab to the examination room without being exposed to the weather
or the gaze of inquisitive onlookers. This door should be sufficiently
wide to allow two hand ambulances or barrows to pass should they
require to be brought out to the ambulance or cab, and to facilitate
this the floor of the entrance hall should be as nearly as possible on
a level with that of the outside porch. Adjoining the entrance
vestibule, lavatory accommodation
should be provided for males and
females who may accompany the
patient. Lavatory accommodation
should also be provided for porters
on duty, and all lavatories should
have a cut-off ventilating passage.

A recess to store ambulance barrows
should adjoin the entrance, and this
recess must be in proportion to the size
of the hospital, in order that a hand
ambulance may always be available
when an accident or urgent case
arrives. The vestibule should lead into
a large waiting-hall with an inquiry
office at its entrance, provided with a
telephone exchange, private exchange
box, also letter and parcel racks. If
possible a window of the inquiry office
should command a view of the main
entrance. A room should be provided
for the medical officer on duty, so that
a medical officer may be always at
hand and that no delay will occur in
attending to a patient on arrival.

Leading off from this waiting-hall, well-lit examination rooms
should be available for the thorough examination of patients, both
male and female, the number of rooms, of course, varying with the
size of the hospital and the amount of work to be done. Each of
these rooms should be fitted with a wash-hand basin and sink, and
a plentiful supply of hot and cold water.

Two rooms, with recovery rooms adjoining, should be fitted up
as small operating-rooms for the treatment of minor casualties.
A special room should also be furnished with an X-ray outfit, and
arrangements should be made whereby this room can be readily
darkened so that suspected fractures, &amp;c. may be examined with
the fluorescent screen.

Adjoining the admission department two small wards should be
provided for the accommodation of drunk or noisy cases unfit to
be placed in the general wards. To these &ldquo;emergency wards&rdquo;
must be attached the usual bathroom and lavatory accommodation,
nurses&rsquo; room, ward kitchen and urine-test room or small lavatory.
These wards should have double windows in order to prevent noise
being heard outside if the wards are near other buildings.

The interior walls of the admission department should, as far as
possible, have a smooth and impervious surface, in order that they
may be easily cleaned. All angles should be avoided and all corners
rounded. Although glazed tiles are open to the criticism that they
have numerous joints, they probably make the most suitable wall
yet devised, as they can be easily washed down at very small cost.
The corridors and waiting-hall should be tiled to a height of 6 ft.
6 in., and the upper walls covered with Parian or Kean&rsquo;s cement,
and be treated with three coats of flat paint and two coats of enamel,
or, what is equally suitable and less costly, enamellette. The floors
of the passages and corridors throughout the department should be
covered with terrazzo, which is a mixture of Portland cement and
marble chips. A margin of 1 ft. round the rooms should be treated
in this way, and the terrazzo carried up this same distance on the
wall to join the tiles. The remainder of the floors should be covered
with hard wood, such as American maple or teak. As these floors
require to be frequently washed, oak is not so suitable. Oak very
soon becomes destroyed with water; the same trouble is experienced
with pitch pine. The doors should also be made of a hard wood,
preferably teak, and have no mouldings or grooves where dust can
lodge. They should be wide enough to admit an ambulance barrow
or bed with ease. In no case should the doors of an examination
room be less than 3 ft. 6 in. in width.

As an aid to a complete understanding of the varied work which
has to be provided for, and the most effective method of carrying it
out, the accompanying plans are given of an admission block designed
to embody the
main principles which
govern the construction
of such a department.




Plans of Ground Floor and Basement of a Hospital.

All accidents and
patients seeking admission
to this hospital enter
through the central gateway,
and on the left is
shown the porters&rsquo; room,
where a porter is always
in readiness to attend to
any applicant. This
room has suitable accommodation
for parcels,
letters, telephones, &amp;c.,
and adjoining it is a
small lavatory for the
use of porters. At the
side of the porters&rsquo; room
is the entrance to the central waiting-hall, which is lit from the
roof. On one side of this hall are examination and dressing-rooms
for males, with lavatory accommodation; and on the other side
similar provision for females, with the addition of a nurses&rsquo; duty
room. At the end of the central hall are two operating theatres,
with recovery room adjoining each; one theatre for males, and the
other for females. Between these theatres are rooms for sterilizers
and dressings. An X-ray examination room is provided beyond the
male examination room on the right of the hall. In the basement,
under the entrance-hall and operating theatres are two bathrooms
for males and two for females, with W.C.&rsquo;s for each. The remainder
of the basement is used as a store for patients&rsquo; clothes, and a hot-air
chamber is provided for purposes of disinfection. The basement
can be reached by a lift or by a wide staircase which is situated at
the end of the waiting-hall.

In the above plan provision is made for a sitting-room for the
medical officer on duty. This is a new and essential feature in the
admission block unit of all hospitals in large cities, for it should
secure that no patient is kept waiting for many minutes before being
seen. One of the blots on the management of many hospitals is
that regrettable delays often take place, and much dissatisfaction
and avoidable suffering may arise from this difficulty in the administration
of a general hospital. We have given this plan of a
model gatehouse or admission block for a modern general hospital,
because the block as it stands contains all the elements necessary
for a receiving-house block in cities in connexion with a great
Hospital city situated outside its area, in fulfilment of the suggestion
for a Hospital city made above. Apart from its interest as a new
feature which all new hospitals should adopt, the gatehouse or
admission block has an importance in the wider sense, that it may
come to form the key to the solution of the problem of how best to
provide hospital accommodation for the poor in great cities under
the best hygienic conditions, while protecting them from the misery
and danger of prolonged delay in first treatment, especially in connexion
with accidents and other cases of urgency.

(H. Bt.)



HOSPITIUM (Gr. &#958;&#949;&#957;&#943;&#945;, &#960;&#961;&#959;&#958;&#949;&#957;&#943;&#945;), &ldquo;hospitality,&rdquo; among the
Greeks and Romans, was of a twofold character: (1) private;
(2) public.

(1) In Homeric times all strangers without exception were
regarded as being under the protection of Zeus Xenios, the god of
strangers and suppliants. It is doubtful whether, as is commonly
assumed, they were considered as ipso facto enemies; they
were rather guests. Immediately on his arrival, the stranger
was clothed and entertained, and no inquiry was made as to
his name or antecedents until the duties of hospitality had
been fulfilled. When the guest parted from his host he was
often presented with gifts (&#958;&#941;&#957;&#953;&#945;), and sometimes a die
(&#7936;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#962;) was broken between them. Each then took a
part, a family connexion was established, and the broken die
served as a symbol of recognition; thus the members of each
family found in the other hosts and protectors in case of need.
Violation of the duties of hospitality was likely to provoke
the wrath of the gods; but it does not appear that anything
beyond this religious sanction existed to guard the
rights of a traveller. Similar customs seem to have existed
among the Italian races. Amongst the Romans, private hospitality,
which had existed from the earliest times, was more
accurately and legally defined than amongst the Greeks, the
tie between host and guest being almost as strong as that
between patron and client. It was of the nature of a contract,
entered into by mutual promise, the clasping of hands, and
exchange of an agreement in writing (tabula hospitalis) or of
a token (tessera or symbolum), and was rendered hereditary
by the division of the tessera. The advantages thus obtained
by the guest were, the right of hospitality when travelling and,
above all, the protection of his host (representing him as his
patron) in a court of law. The contract was sacred and inviolable,
undertaken in the name of Jupiter Hospitalis, and could only
be dissolved by a formal act.

(2) This private connexion developed into a custom according
to which a state appointed one of the citizens of a foreign state
as its representative (&#960;&#961;&#972;&#958;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;) to protect any of its citizens
travelling or resident in his country. Sometimes an individual
came forward voluntarily to perform these duties on behalf of
another state (&#7952;&#952;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#960;&#961;&#972;&#958;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;). The proxenus is generally
compared to the modern consul or minister resident. His
duties were to afford hospitality to strangers from the state
whose proxenus he was, to introduce its ambassadors, to procure
them admission to the assembly and seats in the theatre, and
in general to look after the commercial and political interests
of the state by which he had been appointed to his office. Many
cases occur where such an office was hereditary; thus the
family of Callias at Athens were proxeni of the Spartans. We
find the office mentioned in a Corcyraean inscription dating
probably from the 7th century B.C., and it continued to grow
more important and frequent throughout Greek history. There
is no proof that any direct emolument was ever attached to
the office, while the expense and trouble entailed by it must
often have been very great. Probably the honours which
it brought with it were sufficient recompense. These consisted
partly in the general respect and esteem paid to a proxenus,
and partly in many more substantial honours conferred by
special decree of the state whose representative he was, such
as freedom from taxation and public burdens, the right of
acquiring property in Attica, admission to the senate and popular
assemblies, and perhaps even full citizenship. Public hospitium
seems also to have existed among the Italian races; but the
circumstances of their history prevented it from becoming so
important as in Greece. Cases, however, occur of the establishment
of public hospitality between two cities (Rome and Caere,
Livy v. 50), and of towns entering into a position of clientship
to some distinguished Roman, who then became patronus of
such a town. Foreigners were frequently granted the right
of public hospitality by the senate down to the end of the republic.
The public hospes had a right to entertainment at the
public expense, admission to sacrifices and games, the right of
buying and selling on his own account, and of bringing an action
at law without the intervention of a Roman patron.

Daremberg and Saglio, Dictionnaire des antiquités, to which may
be added R. von Jhering, Die Gastfreundschaft im Altertum (1887);

HOSPODAR, a term of Slavonic origin, meaning &ldquo;lord&rdquo;
(Russ. gospodar). It is a derivative of gospod, &ldquo;lord,&rdquo; and
is akin to gosudar, which primarily means &ldquo;sovereign,&rdquo; and is
now also used in Russia as a polite form of address, equivalent
to &ldquo;sir.&rdquo; The pronunciation as hospodar of a word written
gospodar in all but one of the Slavonic languages which retain
the Cyrillic alphabet is not, as is sometimes alleged, due to the
influence of Little Russian, but to that of Church Slavonic.
In both of these g is frequently pronounced h. In Little Russian
the title hospodar is specially applied to the master of a house
or the head of a family. The rulers of Walachia and Moldavia
were styled hospodars from the 15th century to 1866. At the
end of this period, as the title had been held by many vassals
of Turkey, its retention was considered inconsistent with the
growth of Rumanian independence. It was therefore discarded
in favour of domn (dominus, &ldquo;lord&rdquo;), which continued to be
the official princely title up to the proclamation of a Rumanian
kingdom in 1881.



HOST. (1) (Through the O. Fr. oste or hoste, modern hôte,
from Lat. hospes, a guest or host; hospes being probably from
an original hostipes, one who feeds a stranger or enemy, from
hostis and the root of pascere), one who receives another into
his house and provides him with lodging and entertainment,
especially one who does this in return for payment. The word
is thus transferred, in biology, to an animal or plant upon which
a parasite lives. (2) (From Lat. hostis, a stranger or enemy;
in Med. Latin a military expedition), a very large gathering
of men, armed for war, an army, and so used generally of any
multitude. In biblical use the word is applied to the company
of angels in heaven; or to the sun, moon and stars, the &ldquo;hosts
of heaven,&rdquo; and also to translate &ldquo;Jehovah Sabaoth,&rdquo; the
Lord God of hosts, the lord of the armies of Israel or of the hosts
of heaven. (3) (From Lat. hostia, a victim or sacrifice), the
sacrifice of Christ&rsquo;s body and blood in the Eucharist, more
particularly the consecrated wafer used in the service of the
mass in the Roman Church (see Eucharist).



HOSTAGE (through Fr. ostage, modern otage, from Late
Lat. obsidaticum, the state of being an obses or hostage; Med.
Lat. ostaticum, ostagium), a person handed over by one of two
belligerent parties to the other or seized as security for the
carrying out of an agreement, or as a preventive measure against
certain acts of war. The practice of taking hostages is very
ancient, and has been used constantly in negotiations with
conquered nations, and in cases such as surrenders, armistices
and the like, where the two belligerents depended for its proper
carrying out on each other&rsquo;s good faith. The Romans were
accustomed to take the sons of tributary princes and educate
them at Rome, thus holding a security for the continued loyalty
of the conquered nation and also instilling a possible future
ruler with ideas of Roman civilization. This practice was also
adopted in the early period of the British occupation of India,
and by France in her relations with the Arab tribes in North
Africa.1 The position of a hostage was that of a prisoner of war,
802
to be retained till the negotiations or treaty obligations were
carried out, and liable to punishment (in ancient times), and even
to death, in case of treachery or refusal to fulfil the promises
made. The practice of taking hostages as security for the carrying
out of a treaty between civilized states is now obsolete. The
last occasion was at the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748,
when two British peers, Henry Bowes Howard, 11th earl of
Suffolk, and Charles, 9th Baron Cathcart, were sent to France
as hostages for the restitution of Cape Breton to France.

In modern times the practice may be said to be confined
to two occasions: (1) to secure the payment of enforced contributions
or requisitions in an occupied territory and the
obedience to regulations the occupying army may think fit to
issue; (2) as a precautionary measure, to prevent illegitimate
acts of war or violence by persons not members of the recognized
military forces of the enemy. During the Franco-Prussian War
of 1870, the Germans took as hostages the prominent people
or officials from towns or districts when making requisitions and
also when foraging, and it was a general practice for the mayor
and adjoint of a town which failed to pay a fine imposed upon it
to be seized as &ldquo;hostages&rdquo; and retained till the money was paid.
The last case where &ldquo;hostages&rdquo; have been taken in modern
warfare has been the subject of much discussion. In 1870
the Germans found it necessary to take special measures to put
a stop to train-wrecking by parties in occupied territory not
belonging to the recognized armed forces of the enemy, an
illegitimate act of war. Prominent citizens were placed on the
engine of the train &ldquo;so that it might be understood that in every
accident caused by the hostility of the inhabitants their compatriots
will be the first to suffer.&rdquo; The measure seems to have
been effective. In 1900 during the Boer War, by a proclamation
issued at Pretoria (June 19th), Lord Roberts adopted the plan
for a similar reason, but shortly afterwards (July 29) it was
abandoned (see The Times&rsquo; History of the War in S. Africa,
iv. 402). The Germans also, between the surrender of a town
and its final occupation, took &ldquo;hostages&rdquo; as security against
outbreaks of violence by the inhabitants. Most writers on
international law have regarded this method of preventing such
acts of hostility as unjustifiable, on the ground that the persons
taken as hostages are not the persons responsible for the act;2
that, as by the usage of war hostages are to be treated strictly
as prisoners of war, such an exposure to danger is transgressing
the rights of a belligerent; and as useless, for the mere temporary
removal of important citizens till the end of a war cannot be
a deterrent unless their mere removal deprives the combatants
of persons necessary to the continuance of the acts aimed at
(see W. E. Hall, International Law, 1904, pp. 418, 475). On the
other hand it has been urged (L. Oppenheim, International Law,
1905, vol. ii., &ldquo;War and Neutrality,&rdquo; pp. 271-273) that the acts,
the prevention of which is aimed at, are not legitimate acts on
the part of the armed forces of the enemy, but illegitimate acts
by private persons, who, if caught, could be quite lawfully
punished, and that a precautionary and preventive measure
is more reasonable than &ldquo;reprisals.&rdquo; It may be noticed,
however, that the hostages would suffer should the acts aimed at
be performed by the authorized belligerent forces of the enemy.

In France, after the revolution of Prairial (June 18, 1799),
the so-called &ldquo;law of hostages&rdquo; was passed, to meet the insurrection
in La Vendée. Relatives of émigrés were taken from disturbed
districts and imprisoned, and were liable to execution
at any attempt to escape. Sequestration of their property and
deportation from France followed on the murder of a republican,
four to every such murder, with heavy fines on the whole
body of hostages. The law only resulted in an increase in the
insurrection. Napoleon in 1796 had used similar measures to
deal with the insurrection in Lombardy (Correspondance de
Napoléon I. i. 323, 327, quoted in Hall, International Law).

In May 1871, at the close of the Paris Commune, took place
the massacre of the so-called hostages. Strictly they were not
&ldquo;hostages,&rdquo; for they had not been handed over or seized as
security for the performance of any undertaking or as a preventive
measure, but merely in retaliation for the death of their leaders
E. V. Duval and Gustave Flourens. It was an act of maniacal
despair, on the defeat at Mont Valérien on the 4th of April and
the entry of the army into Paris on the 21st of May. Among the
many victims who were shot in batches the most noticeable were
Monsignor Darboy, archbishop of Paris, the Abbé Deguery, curé
of the Madeleine, and the president of the Court of Cassation,
Louis Bernard Bonjean.

 

1 The sultan of Bagiemi, in Central Africa, in 1906 sent his nephew
to undergo military training with a squadron of Spahis, and at the
same time to serve as a guarantee of his fidelity to the French
(Bulletin du Comité de l&rsquo;Afrique française, Oct. 1906).

2 Article 50 of the Hague War Regulations lays it down that
&ldquo;no general penalty, pecuniary or otherwise, can be inflicted on the
population on account of the acts of individuals for which it cannot
be regarded as collectively responsible.&rdquo; The regulations, however,
do not allude to the practice of taking hostage.




HOSTE, SIR WILLIAM (1780-1828), British naval captain,
was the son of Dixon Hoste, rector of Godwick and Tittleshill
in Norfolk. He was born on the 26th of August 1780 at Ingoldsthorpe,
and entered the navy in April 1793, under the special care
of Nelson, who had a lively affection for him. He became
lieutenant in 1798, and was appointed commander of the
&ldquo;Mutine&rdquo; brig after the battle of the Nile, at which he was present
as lieutenant of the &ldquo;Theseus.&rdquo; In 1802 he was promoted post
captain by Lord St Vincent. During all his active career, he
was employed in the Mediterranean and the Adriatic. From
1808 to 1814 he held the command of a detached force of frigates,
and was engaged in operations against the French who held
Dalmatia at the time, and in watching, or, when they came out,
fighting, the ships of the squadron formed at Venice by Napoleon&rsquo;s
orders. The work was admirably done, and was also lucrative;
and Hoste, although he occasionally complained that his exertions
did not put much money in his pocket, made a fortune of at least
£60,000 by the capture of Italian and Dalmatian merchant
ships. He also made many successful attacks on the French
military posts on shore. His most brilliant feat was performed
on the 13th of March 1811. A Franco-Venetian squadron of six
frigates and five small vessels, under the command of a French
officer named Dubourdieu, assailed Hoste&rsquo;s small force of four
frigates near the island of Lissa. The French officer imitated
Nelson&rsquo;s attack at Trafalgar by sailing down on the English
line from windward with his ships in two lines. But the rapid
man&oelig;uvring and gunnery of Hoste&rsquo;s squadron proved how little
virtue there is in any formation in itself. Dubourdieu was killed,
one of the French frigates was driven on shore, and two of the
Venetians were taken. After the action, which attracted a
great deal of attention, Hoste returned to England, but in 1812
he was back on his station, where he remained till the end of the
war. During the peace he did not again go to sea, and he died
on the 6th of December 1828. He married Lady Harriet Walpole
in April 1817, and left three sons and three daughters.


In 1833 his widow published his Memoirs and Letters. See also
Marshall, Roy. Nav. Biog. vol. iii., and James, Naval History.




HOSTEL, the old name for an inn (see Hospital, ad init.);
also employed at Oxford and Cambridge to designate the
lodgings which were in ancient times occupied by students
of the university and to a certain extent regulated by the
authorities. In some English public schools what is known
as the &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; system provides for an organization of the
lodging accommodation under separate masterships.



HOSTIUS, Roman epic poet, probably flourished in the 2nd
century B.C. He was the author of a Bellum Histricum in at
least seven books, of which only a few fragments remain. The
poem is probably intended to celebrate the victory gained in
129 by Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus (consul and himself an
annalist) over the Illyrian Iapydes (Appian, Illyrica, 10; Livy,
epit. 59). Hostius is supposed by some to be the &ldquo;doctus avus&rdquo;
alluded to in Propertius (iv. 20. 8), the real name of Propertius&rsquo;s
Cynthia, according to Apuleius (Apologia x.) and the scholiast
on Juvenal (vi. 7), being Hostia (perhaps Roscia).

(1884); A. Weichert, Poetarum Latinorum reliquiae (1830).




HOSUR, a town of British India, in the Salem district of
Madras, 24 m. E. of Bangalore. Pop. (1901) 6695. It contains
an old fort, frequently mentioned in the history of the Mysore
wars, and a fine castellated mansion built by a former collector.
803
Close by is the remount depôt, established in 1828, where
Australian horses are acclimatized and trained for artillery
and cavalry use in southern India.



HOTCH-POT, or Hotch-potch (from Fr. hocher, to shake;
used as early as 1292 as a law term, and from the 15th century
in cookery for a sort of broth with many ingredients, and so
used figuratively for any heterogeneous mixture), in English law,
the name given to a rule of equity whereby a person, interested
along with others in a common fund, and having already received
something in the same interest, is required to surrender what
has been so acquired into the common fund, on pain of being
excluded from the distribution. &ldquo;It seemeth,&rdquo; says Littleton,
&ldquo;that this word hotch-pot is in English a pudding; for in a
pudding is not commonly put one thing alone, but one thing
with other things together.&rdquo; The following is an old example
given in Coke on Littleton: &ldquo;If a man seized of 30 acres
of land in fee hath issue only two daughters, and he gives with
one of them 10 acres in marriage to the man that marries her,
and dies seized of the other 20; now she that is thus married,
to gain her share of the rest of the land, must put her part
given in marriage into hotch-pot; i.e. she must refuse to take
the profits thereof, and cause her land to be so mingled with the
other that an equal division of the whole may be made between
her and her sister, as if none had been given to her; and thus
for her 10 acres she shall have 15, or otherwise the sister will
have the 20.&rdquo; In the common law this seems to have been
the only instance in which the rule was applied, and the reason
assigned for it is that, inasmuch as daughters succeeding to lands
take together as coparceners and not by primogeniture, the
policy of the law is that the land in such cases should be equally
divided. The law of hotch-pot applies only to lands descending
in fee-simple. The same principle is noticed by Blackstone
as applying in the customs of York and London to personal
property. It is also expressly enacted in the Statute of Distributions
(§ 5) that no child of the intestate, except his heir-at-law,
who shall have any estate in land by the settlement of the
intestate, or who shall be advanced by the intestate in his
lifetime by pecuniary portion equal to the distributive shares
of the other children, shall participate with them in the surplus;
but if the estate so given to such child by way of advancement
be not equivalent to their shares, then such part of the surplus as
will make it equal shall be allotted to him. It has been decided
that this provision applies only to advancements by fathers, on
the ground that the rule was founded on the custom of London,
which never affected a widow&rsquo;s personal estate. The heir-at-law
is not required to bring any land which he has by descent or
otherwise from the deceased into hotch-pot, but advancements
made to him out of the personal property must be brought
in. The same principle is to be found in the collatio bonorum
of the Roman law: emancipated children, in order to share
the inheritance of their father with the children unemancipated,
were required to bring their property into the common fund.
It is also found in the law of Scotland.



HÔTEL-DE-VILLE, the town hall of every French municipality.
The most ancient example still in perfect preservation
is that at St-Antonin (Tarn-et-Garonne) dating from the middle
of the 12th century. Other fine town halls are those of Compiègne,
Orléans, Saumur, Beaugency and St Quentin. The
Hôtel de Ville in Paris built in the 16th century was burnt by
the Commune in 1871 and has since been rebuilt on an extended
site, the central portion of the main front being a reproduction
of the old design. There is only one town hall in a French town,
those erected for the mayors of the different arrondissements
in Paris being called mairies.



HÔTEL-DIEU, the name given to the principal hospital in
any French town. The Hôtel-Dieu in Paris was founded in the
year A.D. 660, has been extended at various times, and was
entirely rebuilt between 1868-1878. One of the most ancient
in France is at Angers, dating from 1153. The Hôtel-Dieu of
Beaune (Côte-d&rsquo;Or), founded 1443, is one of the most interesting,
as it retains the picturesque disposition of its courtyard, with
covered galleries on two storeys and large dormer windows;
and the great hall of the Hôtel-Dieu at Tonnerre, Yonne (1338),
nearly 60 ft. wide and over 300 ft. long, is still preserved as part
of the chief hospital of the town.



HOTHAM, SIR JOHN (d. 1645), English parliamentarian,
belonged to a Yorkshire family, and fought on the continent
of Europe during the early part of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. In
1622 he was made a baronet, and he was member of parliament
for Beverley in the five parliaments between 1625 and 1640,
being sheriff of Yorkshire in 1635. In 1639 he was deprived
by the king of his office of governor of Hull, and joining the
parliamentary party refused to pay ship-money. In January
1642 Hotham was ordered by the parliament to seize Hull,
where there was a large store of munitions of war; this was
at once carried out by his son John. Hotham took command
of Hull and in April 1642 refused to admit Charles I. to the
town. Later he promised his prisoner, Lord Digby, that he
would surrender it to the king, but when Charles appeared
again he refused a second time and drove away the besiegers.
Meanwhile the younger Hotham was taking an active part in
the Civil War in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, but was soon at
variance with other parliamentary leaders, especially with the
Fairfaxes, and complaints about his conduct and that of his
troops were made by Cromwell and by Colonel Hutchinson.
Soon both the Hothams were corresponding with the earl of
Newcastle, and the younger one was probably ready to betray
Hull; these proceedings became known to the parliament,
and in June 1643 father and son were captured and taken to
London. After a long delay they were tried by court-martial,
were found guilty and were sentenced to death. The younger
Hotham was beheaded on the 2nd of January 1645, and in
spite of efforts made by the House of Lords and the Presbyterians
to save him, the elder suffered the same fate on the following
day. Sir John Hotham had two other sons who were persons
of some note: Charles Hotham (1615-c. 1672), rector of Wigan,
a Cambridge scholar and author of Ad philosophiam Teutonicam
Manuductio (1648); and Durant Hotham (1617-1691), who
wrote a Life of Jacob Boehme (1654).



HOTHAM, WILLIAM HOTHAM, 1st Baron (1736-1813),
British Admiral, son of Sir Beaumont Hotham (d. 1771), a
lineal descendant of the above Sir John Hotham, was educated
at Westminster School and at the Royal Naval Academy,
Portsmouth. He entered the navy in 1751, and spent most of his
midshipman&rsquo;s time in American waters. In 1755 he became
lieutenant in Sir Edward Hawke&rsquo;s flagship the &ldquo;St George,&rdquo; and
he soon received a small command, which led gradually to higher
posts. In the &ldquo;Syren&rdquo; (20) he fought a sharp action with the
French &ldquo;Télémaque&rdquo; of superior force, and in the &ldquo;Fortune&rdquo;
sloop he carried, by boarding, a 26-gun privateer. For this
service he was rewarded with a more powerful ship, and from
1757 onwards commanded various frigates. In 1759 his ship
the &ldquo;Melampe,&rdquo; with H.M.S. &ldquo;Southampton,&rdquo; fought a spirited
action with two hostile frigates of similar force, one of which
became their prize. The &ldquo;Melampe&rdquo; was attached to Keppel&rsquo;s
squadron in 1761, but was in the main employed in detached
duty and made many captures. In 1776, as a commodore,
Hotham served in North American waters, and he had a great
share in the brilliant action in the Cul de Sac of St Lucia (Dec.
15th, 1778). Here he continued till the spring of 1781, when he
was sent home in charge of a large convoy of merchantmen.
Off Scilly Hotham fell in with a powerful French squadron,
against which he could effect nothing, and many of the merchantmen
went to France as prizes. In 1782 Commodore Hotham
was with Howe at the relief of Gibraltar, and at the time of the
Spanish armament of 1790 he flew his flag as rear-admiral
of the red. Some time later he was made vice-admiral. As
Hood&rsquo;s second-in-command in the Mediterranean he was engaged
against the French Revolutionary navy, and when his chief
retired to England the command devolved upon him. On March
12th, 1794 he fought an indecisive fleet action, in which the brunt
of the fighting was borne by Captain Horatio Nelson, and some
months later, now a full admiral, he again engaged, this time
under conditions which might have permitted a decisive victory;
804
of this affair Nelson wrote home that it was a &ldquo;miserable action.&rdquo;
A little later he returned to England, and in 1797 he was made
a peer of Ireland under the title of Baron Hotham of South
Dalton, near Hull. He died in 1813. Hotham lacked the fiery
energy and genius of a Nelson or a Jervis, but in subordinate
positions he was a brave and capable officer.

As Hotham died unmarried his barony passed to his brother,
Sir Beaumont Hotham (1737-1814), who became 2nd Baron
Hotham in May 1813. Beaumont, who was a baron of the
exchequer for thirty years, died on the 4th of March 1814, and
was succeeded as 3rd baron by his grandson Beaumont Hotham
(1794-1870), who was present at the battle of Waterloo, being
afterwards a member of parliament for forty-eight years. He died
unmarried in December 1870 and was succeeded by his nephew,
Charles (1836-1872), and then by another nephew, John (1838-1907).
In 1907 his cousin Frederick William (b. 1863) became
the 6th baron.

Other distinguished members of this family were the 2nd
baron&rsquo;s son, Sir Henry Hotham (1777-1833), a vice-admiral, who
saw a great deal of service during the Napoleonic wars; and Sir
William Hotham (1772-1848), a nephew of the 1st baron, who
served with Duncan in 1797 off Camperdown and elsewhere.

HOTHO, HEINRICH GUSTAV (1802-1873), German historian
of art, was born at Berlin in 1802, and died in his native city on
Christmas day 1873. During boyhood he was affected for two
years with blindness consequent on an attack of measles. But
recovering his sight he studied so hard as to take his degree at
Berlin in 1826. A year of travel spent in visiting Paris, London
and the Low Countries determined his vocation. He came home
delighted with the treasures which he had seen, worked laboriously
for a higher examination and passed as &ldquo;docent&rdquo; in
aesthetics and art history. In 1829 he was made professor at
the university of Berlin. In 1833 G. F. Waagen accepted him
as assistant in the museum of the Prussian capital; and in 1858
he was promoted to the directorship of the print-room. During
a long and busy life, in which his time was divided between
literature and official duties, Hotho&rsquo;s ambition had always been
to master the history of the schools of Germany and the Netherlands.
Accordingly what he published was generally confined
to those countries. In 1842-1843 he gave to the world his account
of German and Flemish painting. From 1853 to 1858 he revised
and published anew a part of this work, which he called &ldquo;The
school of Hubert van Eyck, with his German precursors and
contemporaries.&rdquo; His attempt later on to write a history of
Christian painting overtasked his strength, and remained
unfinished. Hotho is important in the history of aesthetics
as having developed Hegel&rsquo;s theories; but he was deficient in
knowledge of Italian painting.



HOTI-MARDAN, or Mardan, a frontier cantonment of British
India in the Peshawar district of the North-West Frontier
Province, situated 15 m. N. of Nowshera. Pop. (1901) 3572.
It is notable as the permanent headquarters of the famous
corps of Guides, and also contains a cavalry brigade belonging
to the 1st division of the northern army.



HOTMAN, FRANÇOIS (1524-1590), French publicist, eldest
son of Pierre Hotman, was born on the 23rd of August 1524,
at Paris, his family being of Silesian origin. His name is latinized
by himself Hotomanus, by others Hotomannus and Hottomannus.
His father, a zealous Catholic, and a counsellor of
the parlement of Paris, destined him for the law, and sent him
at the age of fifteen to the university of Orleans. He obtained
his doctorate in three years, and became a pleader at Paris. The
arts of the barrister were not to his taste; he turned to the study
of jurisprudence and literature, and in 1546 was appointed
lecturer in Roman Law at the university of Paris. The fortitude
of Anne Dubourg under torture gained his adhesion to the
cause of Reform. Giving up a career on which he had entered
with high repute, he went in 1547 to Lyons, and thence to Geneva
and to Lausanne, where, on the recommendation of Calvin, he
was appointed professor of belles-lettres and history, and
married Claudine Aubelin, a refugee from Orleans. On the
invitation of the magistracy, he lectured at Strassburg on law
in 1555, and became professor in 1556, superseding François
Baudouin, who had been his colleague in Paris. His fame was
such that overtures were made to him by the courts of Prussia
and Hesse, and by Elizabeth of England. Twice he visited
Germany, in 1556 accompanying Calvin to the Diet at Frankfort.
He was entrusted with confidential missions from the Huguenot
leaders to German potentates, carrying at one time credentials
from Catherine de Medici. In 1560 he was one of the principal
instigators of the conspiracy of Amboise; in September of that
year he was with Antoine of Navarre at Nérac. In 1562 he
attached himself to Condé. In 1564 he became professor of civil
law at Valence, retrieving by his success the reputation of its
university. In 1567 he succeeded Cujas in the chair of jurisprudence
at Bourges. Five months later his house and library
were wrecked by a Catholic mob; he fled by Orleans to Paris,
where L&rsquo;Hôpital made him historiographer to the king. As
agent for the Huguenots, he was sent to Blois to negotiate the
peace of 1568. He returned to Bourges, only to be again driven
away by the outbreak of hostilities. At Sancerre, during its siege,
he composed his Consolatio (published in 1593). The peace of 1570
restored him to Bourges, whence a third time he fled, in consequence
of the St Bartholomew massacre (1572). In 1573, after
publishing his Franco-Gallia, he left France for ever with his
family, and became professor of Roman law at Geneva. On
the approach of the duke of Savoy he removed to Basel in 1579.
In 1580 he was appointed councillor of state to Henry of Navarre.
The plague sent him in 1582 to Montbéliard; here he lost his wife.
Returning to Geneva in 1584 he developed a kind of scientific
turn, dabbling in alchemy and the research for the philosopher&rsquo;s
stone. In 1589 he made his final retirement to Basel, where he
died on the 12th of February 1590, leaving two sons and four
daughters; he was buried in the cathedral.

Hotman was a man of pure life, real piety (as his Consolatio
shows) and warm domestic virtues. His constant removals were
inspired less by fear for himself than by care for his family, and
by a temperament averse to the conditions of warfare, and a
constitutional desire for peace. He did much for 16th-century
jurisprudence, having a critical knowledge of Roman sources, and
a fine Latin style. He broached the idea of a national code of
French law. His works were very numerous, beginning with
his De gradibus cognationis (1546), and including a treatise on
the Eucharist (1566); a treatise (Anti-Tribonien, 1567) to show
that French law could not be based on Justinian; a life of
Coligny (1575); a polemic (Brutum fulmen, 1585) directed
against a bull of Sixtus V., with many other works on law,
history, politics and classical learning. His most important
work, the Franco-Gallia (1573), was in advance of his age, and
found favour neither with Catholics nor with Huguenots in its
day; yet its vogue has been compared to that obtained later by
Rousseau&rsquo;s Contrat Social. It presented an ideal of Protestant
statesmanship, pleading for a representative government and
an elective monarchy. It served the purpose of the Jesuits in
their pamphlet war against Henry IV.

HOT SPRINGS, a city of Arkansas, U.S.A., the county-seat of
Garland county, at the easterly base of the Ozark mountains,
55 m. by rail W.S.W. of Little Rock. Pop. (1880) 3554; (1890)
8086; (1900) 9973, of whom 3102 were of negro descent and
561 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 14,434. The transient
population numbers more than 100,000 annually. Hot Springs
is served by the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific, the Little Rock
&amp; Hot Springs Western, and the St Louis, Iron Mountain &amp;
Southern railways. The city lies partly in several mountain
ravines and partly on a plateau. A creek, flowing through the
valley but walled over, empties into the Ouachita river several
miles from Hot Springs. The elevation of the surrounding hills
is about 1200 ft. above the sea and 600 above the surrounding
country. The scenery is beautiful, and there is a remarkable
view from a steel tower observatory, 150 ft. high, on the top
of Hot Springs mountain. The climate is delightful. The
805
average rainfall for the year is about 55 in. The springs are
about forty-four in number, rising within an area of 3 acres
on the slope of Hot Springs mountain. They are all included
within a reservation held by the United States government,
which (since 1903) exercises complete jurisdiction. The daily
flow from the springs used is more than 800,000 gallons. Their
temperature varies from 95° to 147° F. The waters are tasteless
and inodorous, and contain calcium and magnesium bicarbonates,
combinations of hydrogen and silicon, and of iodides, bromides
and lithium. The national government maintains at Hot
Springs an army and navy hospital, and a bath-house open
gratuitously to indigent bathers. The business of Hot Springs
consists mainly in caring for its visitors. Fruit-raising and
small gardening characterize its environs. There are sulphur,
lithia and other springs near the city, and an ostrich farm and
an alligator farm in the suburbs. The finest of the novaculite
rocks of central Arkansas are quarried near the city. The total
value of its factory product in 1905 was $597,029, an increase
of 213.1% since 1900.

The Springs were first used by the itinerant trappers. They
were visited about 1800 by French hunters; and by members
of the Lewis and Clark party in 1804 under instructions from
President Thomas Jefferson. The permanent occupation of the
town site dates only from 1828, though as early as 1807 a
temporary settlement was made. In 1876 Hot Springs was
incorporated as a town, and in 1879 it was chartered as a city.
In 1832 Congress created a reservation, but the right of the
government as against private claimants was definitely settled
only in 1876, by a decision of the United States Supreme Court.
The city was almost destroyed by fire in 1878, and was greatly
improved in the rebuilding.



HOT SPRINGS, a hamlet and health-resort in Cedar Creek
District, Bath county, Virginia, U.S.A., 25 m. by rail (a branch
of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio railway) N. by E. of Covington and
near the N.W. border of the state. It lies in a narrow valley,
about 2200-2500 ft. above the sea, with rugged mountains on
either side. Pop. of the district (1900) 1761; (1910) 2472. The
mean summer temperature is only 69° F., and the summer nights
are always cool. There is a good golf-course. Mineral waters
(with magnesia, soda-lithia and alum) issue from several springs,
some at a temperature as high as 106° F., and are used both for
drinking and for bathing. The Warm Sulphur Springs (about
98° F.) are 5 m. N.; Healing Springs (85° F.) are 2½ m. S. of
Hot Springs; and a few miles to the S.E., in Rockbridge county,
are Rockbridge and Jordan Alum Springs.



HOTTENTOTS, an African people of western Cape Colony and
the adjoining German territory, formerly widely spread throughout
South Africa. The name is that given them by the early
Dutch settlers at the Cape, being a Dutch word of an onomatopoeic
kind to express stammering, in reference to the staccato pronunciation
and clicks of the native language. Some early writers
termed them Hodmadods or Hodmandods, and others Hot-nots
and Ottentots&mdash;all corruptions of the same word. Their name
for themselves was Khoi-Khoin (men of men), or Quae Quae,
Kwekhena, t&rsquo;Kuhkeub, the forms varying according to the
several dialects. Early authorities believed them to be totally
distinct from all other African races. The researches of Gustav
Fritsch, Dr E. T. Hamy, F. Shrubsall and others have demonstrated,
however, that they are not so much a distinct or independent
variety of mankind as the result of a very old cross
between two other varieties&mdash;the Bantu Negro (containing
a distinct Hamitic element) and the Bushman. Hamy calls them
simply &ldquo;Bushman-Bantu half-breeds,&rdquo; the Bushman element
being seen in the leathery colour, compared to that of the &ldquo;sere
and yellow leaf&rdquo;; in the remarkably prominent cheekbones
and pointed chin, giving the face a peculiarly triangular shape;
and lastly, in such highly specialized characters as the tablier
and the steatopygia of the women. The cranial capacity is also
nearly the same (1331 c.c. in the Bushman, 1365 c.c. in the
Hottentot), and on these anatomical grounds Shrubsall concludes
that the two are essentially one race, allowing for the undeniable
strain of Bantu blood in the Hottentot. This view is further
strengthened by the vast range in prehistoric times of the
Hottentot variety, which, since the time of Martin H. K. Lichtenstein
(1800-1804), was known to have comprised the whole of
Africa south of the Zambezi, and has since been extended as
far north as the equatorial lake region.

Fritsch divides the Hottentots into three bodies; the Cape
Hottentots, from the Cape peninsula eastward to Kaffraria,
the Koranna, chiefly on the right bank of the Orange river, but
also found on the Harts and the Vaal, and the Namaqua in the
western portion of South Africa. Of these all save the last
mentioned have ceased to exist in any racial purity. The name
which the Namaqua give to themselves is Khoi-Khoin, and this
name must be distinguished from that of the Berg-Damara or
Hau-Khoin, since the latter are physically of Bantu origin
though they have borrowed their speech from the Hottentots.
While the Namaqua preserve the racial type and speech, the
other so-called Hottentots are more or less Hottentot-Dutch
or Hottentot-Bantu half-breeds, mainly of debased Dutch
speech, although the Koranna still here and there speak a
moribund Hottentot jargon flooded with Dutch and English
words and expressions. When the Cape Colony became a part
of the British empire the protection given to the natives
arrested the process of extermination with which the Hottentots
were then threatened, but it did not promote racial purity.
Sir John Barrow, describing the condition of the Hottentots in
1798, estimated their number at about 15,000 souls. In 1806
the official return gave a Hottentot population of 9784 males
and 10,642 females. In 1824 they had increased to 31,000.
At the census of 1865 they numbered 81,589, but by this time
the official classification &ldquo;Hottentot&rdquo; signified little more
than a half-breed. The returns for 1904 showed a &ldquo;Hottentot&rdquo;
population of 85,892. Very few of these were pure-bred Hottentots,
while the official estimate of those in which Hottentot blood
was strongly marked was 56,000.


Customs and Culture.&mdash;The primitive character of the race having
greatly changed, the best information as to their original manners
and customs is therefore to be found in the older writers. All these
agree in describing the Hottentots as a gentle and friendly people.
They held in contempt the man who could eat, drink or smoke alone.
They were hospitable to strangers, even to the point of impoverishing
themselves. Although mentally and physically indolent, they were
active in the care of their cattle and, within certain limits, clever
hunters. They were of a medium height, the females rather smaller
than the men, slender but well proportioned, with small hands and
feet. Their skin was of a leathery brown colour; their face oval,
with prominent cheekbones; eyes dark brown or black and wide
apart; nose broad and thick and flat at the root; chin pointed
and mouth large, with thick turned-out lips. Their woolly hair grew
in short thick curly tufts and the beard was very scanty. Amongst
the women abnormal developments of fat were somewhat common;
and cases occurred of extraordinary elongation of the labia minora
and of the praeputium clitoridis.1

Their dress was a skin cloak (kaross) worn across the shoulders
and a smaller one across the loins. They wore these cloaks all the
year round, turning the hairy side inward in winter and outward in
summer; they slept in them at night, and when they died they were
buried in them. They had suspended around their necks little bags
or pouches, containing their knives, their pipes and tobacco or
dakka (Cannabis, or hemp), and an amulet of burnt wood. On their
arms were rings of ivory. Sometimes they wore sandals and carried
a jackal&rsquo;s tail fastened on a stick, which served as handkerchief
and fan. The women wore, besides the kaross, a little apron to
which were hung their ornaments; and underneath this one or
two fringed girdles; and a skin cap. Both sexes smeared themselves
and even their dress with an ointment made of soot, butter or fat,
and the powdered leaves of a shrub called by them bucchu (Diosma
crenata).

Their villages were usually on meadow grounds. They never
entirely exhausted the grass but kept moving from one pasture to
another. The huts were in circles, the area of which varied with
the pastoral wealth of the community. In the centre of the huts
a hole served for a fire-place, and at each side of this small excavations
an inch or two deep were made in the ground in which both sexes,
rolled up in their karosses, slept. A few earthen vessels, well-made
bowls of wood, tortoise shells for spoons and dishes, calabashes,
bamboos and skins for holding milk and butter, and mats of rushes
interwoven with bast, were all their furniture. Their weapons
were primarily bows and arrows, but they also possessed assegais,
806
and knob-kerries. To women much respect was shown; the most
sacred oath a Hottentot could take was to swear by his sister or
mother; yet the females ate apart from the men and did all the
work of the kraal with the exception of the tending of cattle and of
the curing of the hides; the men, however, assisted in the erection of
the framework of the huts. The usual food of the Hottentots was
milk, the flesh of the buffalo, hippopotamus, antelope or other
game, and edible roots and bulbs or wild fruits. On the coast fish
captured by hooks and lines or spears were also eaten. Cows&rsquo; milk
was commonly drunk by both sexes, but ewes&rsquo; milk only by the
women, and when cows&rsquo; milk was scarce the women were obliged to
keep to ewes&rsquo; milk or water. Milk was drunk fresh, and not allowed
to turn sour as among the Bantu. Meats were eaten either roasted
or boiled, but for the most part half raw, without salt, spices or
bread. From some meats they carefully abstained, such as swine&rsquo;s
flesh. Hares and rabbits were forbidden to the men, but not to the
women; the pure blood of beasts and the flesh of the mole were
forbidden to the women, but not to the men.

In occupation they were essentially cattle-breeders, and showed
great skill in this pursuit, especially the Namaqua, who were capable
of training the horns of their cattle so that they grew in spirals.
Their social pleasures consisted in feasting, smoking, dancing and
singing. Dances were held every first quarter of the moon and
lasted all night, often for eight days in succession. Every signal
event of life, and every change of abode and condition was celebrated
with a feast. On the formation of a new kraal an arbour was constructed
in the centre, and the women and children adorned and
perfumed it with flowers and branches of trees and odoriferous herbs.
The fattened ox was killed and cooked, and the men ate of it in the
arbour, while the women sitting apart regaled themselves with broth.
Upon such occasions the only intoxicant was tobacco or dakka.

Circumcision, which is common to the Kaffir tribes, was unknown
to the Hottentots, but when a youth entered upon manhood a
ceremony was performed. One of the elders, using a knife of quartz,
made incisions in the young man&rsquo;s body, afterwards besprinkling
them with urine. When a man killed his first elephant, hippopotamus
or rhinoceros, similar marks were made on his body, and
were regarded as insignia of honour. Finger mutilation was common,
especially among women; this consisted in the removal of one or
two joints of the little finger, and, sometimes, the first joint of the
next. The reason for this is doubtful; it may have been a sign of
mourning, or, especially in the case of children, it may have been
regarded as magically protective. Marriages were by arrangement
between the man and the girl&rsquo;s parents, the consent of the girl
herself being a matter of little consideration. If accepted, the suitor,
accompanied by all his kindred, drove two or three fat oxen to the
house of his bride. There her relations welcomed the visitors;
the oxen were slain, and the bridal feast took place. The nuptial
ceremony was concluded by an elder besprinkling the happy pair.
Among the southern Hottentots these ancient usages have ceased;
but they are continued among some tribes north of the Orange
river. Polygamy was allowed: divorce was common. Family
names were perpetuated in a peculiar manner&mdash;the sons took the
family name of the mother, the daughters that of the father. The
children were very respectful to their parents, by whom they were
kindly and affectionately treated. Yet the aged father or mother
was sometimes put in the bush and left to die. Namaqua says this
was done by very poor people if they had no food for their parents.
But even when there was food enough, aged persons, especially
women, who were believed to be possessed of the evil spirit, were so
treated.

The Hottentots had few musical instruments. One named the
&ldquo;gorah&rdquo; was formed by stretching a piece of the twisted entrails
of a sheep from end to end of a thin hollow stick about 3 ft. in length
in the manner of a bow and string. At one end there was a piece
of quill fixed into the stick, to which the mouth of the player was
applied. The &ldquo;rommel-pot&rdquo; was a kind of drum shaped like a
bowl and containing water to keep the membrane moist. Reeds
several feet long were used as flutes.

Government and Laws.&mdash;The system of government was patriarchal.
Each tribe had its hereditary &ldquo;khu-khoi&rdquo; or &ldquo;gao-ao&rdquo; or chief,
and each kraal its captain. These met in council whenever any great
matters had to be decided. The post was honorary, and the councillors
were held in great reverence, and were installed in office
with solemnities and feasting. In certain tribes the hind part of
every bullock slaughtered was sent to the chief, and this he distributed
among the males of the village. He also collected sufficient
milk at the door of his hut to deal out amongst the poor. A part of
every animal taken in hunting was exacted by the chief, even
though it was in a state of putrefaction when brought to him.
The captains, assisted by the men of each kraal, settled disputes
regarding property and tried criminals. A murderer was beaten or
stoned to death; but if one escaped and was at large for a whole
year, he was allowed to go unpunished. Adultery seldom occurred;
if any one found parties in the act and killed them he was no
murderer, but on the contrary received praise for his deed. Women
found offending were burnt. Theft, especially cattle-stealing, was
severely punished. The thief was bound hand and foot, and left
on the ground without food for a long time; then, if his offence
was slight, he received some blows with a stick, but if the case was
an aggravated one, he was severely beaten, and then unloosed and
banished from the kraal. The family of even the worst criminal
suffered nothing on his account in reputation, privilege or property.
The duel was an institution. If any one was insulted he challenged
his enemy by offering him a handful of earth. If the latter seized
the hand and the dust fell to the ground, the challenge was accepted.
If it was not accepted, the challenger threw the dust in his foe&rsquo;s
face. The duel took place by kicking, with clubs, or with the spear
and shield.

Religious Ideas.&mdash;The religious ideas of the Hottentots were very
obscure. François le Vaillant says they had &ldquo;neither priests nor
temples, nor idols, nor ceremonials, nor any traces of the notion of
a deity.&rdquo; Other authorities state that they believed in a benevolent
deity or &ldquo;Great Captain,&rdquo; whom they named Tik-guoa (Tsu-goab).
There were other &ldquo;captains&rdquo; of less power, and a black captain
named Gauna, the spirit of evil. The moon was a secondary divinity,
supposed to govern the weather; and its appearance each month
was hailed with dancing and singing.2 George Schmidt, the first
missionary to the Hottentots, says they also celebrated the annual
appearance of the Pleiades above the eastern horizon. As soon as
the constellation appeared, all the mothers ascended the nearest
hill, carrying their babies, whom they taught to stretch their arms
towards the friendly stars. Some of the tribes are said to worship
a being whom they name Tusib, the rain god. An old Namaqua was
once heard to say &ldquo;The stars are the souls of the deceased,&rdquo; and a
Hottentot form of imprecation is &ldquo;Thou happy one, may misfortune
fall on thee from the star of my grandfather.&rdquo;

Such as it was, the Hottentot religion was largely ancestor-worship.
Their deified hero was named Heitsi-Eibib; and of him endless
stories are told. The one most generally accepted is that he was a
notable warrior of great physical strength, who once ruled the
Khoi-Khoin, and that in a desperate struggle with one of his enemies,
whom he finally overcame, he received a wound in the knee, from
which event he got the name of &ldquo;Wounded knee.&rdquo; He had extraordinary
powers during life, and after death he continued to be
invoked as one who could still relieve and protect. According to
the tradition preserved among the Namaqua, Heitsi-Eibib came
from the east. Therefore they make the doors of their huts towards
the east, and those who possess waggons and carts put their vehicles
alongside the mat-house with the front turned towards the east.
All the graves are in true west-easterly direction, so that the face of
the deceased looks towards the east. The spirit of Heitsi-Eibib is
supposed to exist in the old burial places, and, whenever a heathen
Hottentot passes them, he throws stones on the spot as an offering,
at the same time invoking the spirit&rsquo;s blessing and protection.
Johann Georg von Hahn asserts that there are many proofs which
justify the conclusion that Heitsi-Eibib and Tsu-goab (the supreme
being) were identical. Both were benevolent. Both were believed
to have died and risen again. They killed the bad beings and
restored peace on earth; they promised men immortality, understood
the secrets of nature, and could foretell the future.3

Various ceremonies were practised to ward off the evil influence of
ghosts and spectres, and charms were freely employed. If a Khoi-Khoi
went out hunting his wife kindled a fire, and assiduously
watched by it to keep it alive; if the fire should be extinguished her
husband would not be lucky. If she did not make a fire, she went
to the water and kept on throwing it about on the ground, believing
that thereby her husband would be successful in getting game.
Charms, consisting of bones, burnt wood, and roots of particular
shrubs cut into small pieces, were generally worn round the neck.
There was also a belief that in every fountain there was a snake,
and that as long as the snake remained there water would continue
to flow, but that if the snake was killed or left the fountain it would
cease. Offerings were sometimes made to the spirit of the fountain.
In common with the Bushmen, the Hottentots venerated the
mantis fausta, a local variety of the insect known as &ldquo;the praying
mantis&rdquo; (mantis religiosa). P. Kolbe saw sacrifices made in its
honour when it appeared inside a kraal; to kill it was strictly
forbidden. The Hottentots had great faith in witch-doctors, or
sorcerers. When called to a sick-bed these ordered the patient to
lie on his back, and then pinched, cuffed, and beat him all over until
they expelled the illness. After that they produced a bone, small
snake, frog or other object which they pretended to have extracted
from the patient&rsquo;s body. If the treatment did not succeed, the person
was declared incurably bewitched. If death occurred, the corpse
was interred on the day of decease. It was wrapt in skins, and
placed in the ground in the same position it once occupied in the
mother&rsquo;s womb. Death was generally regarded in a very stoical
manner.

Language.&mdash;The existence of a fundamental connexion between
the language of the Hottentot and that of the Bushman was
807
suggested by Dr Bleek and is supported by further evidence advanced
by Bertin.

The Hottentot language was regarded by the early travellers and
colonists as an uncouth and barbarous tongue. The Portuguese
called the native manner of speaking stammering; and the Dutch
compared it to the &ldquo;gobbling of a turkey-cock.&rdquo; These phonetic
characteristics arose from the common use of &ldquo;clicks,&rdquo;&mdash;sounds
produced by applying the tongue to the teeth or to various parts of
the gums or roof of the mouth, and suddenly jerking it back.
Three-fourths of the syllabic elements of the language begin with
these clicks, and combined with them are several hard and deep
gutturals and nasal accompaniments. The difficulty a European
has in acquiring an accurate pronunciation is not so much in producing
the clicking sound singly as in following it immediately
with another letter or syllable. The four recognized clicks, with
the symbols generally adopted to denote them, are as follows:
dental = |; palatal = &#9839;; lateral = ||; cerebral = !. According to
Tindall, one of the best grammarians of the language, the dental
click (similar to a sound of surprise or indignation) is produced by
pressing the top of the tongue against the upper front teeth, and
then suddenly and forcibly withdrawing it. The palatal click
(like the crack of a whip) is produced by pressing the tongue with
as flat a surface as possible against the termination of the palate at
the gums, so that the top of the tongue touches the upper front
teeth and the back of the tongue lies towards the palate, and then
forcibly withdrawing the tongue. The cerebral click (compared to
the popping of the cork of a bottle of champagne) is produced by
curling up the tip of the tongue against the roof of the palate, and
withdrawing it suddenly and forcibly. The lateral click (similar
to the sound used in stimulating a horse to action) is articulated
by covering with the tongue the whole of the palate and producing
the sound as far back as possible; Europeans imitate it by placing
the tongue against the side teeth and then withdrawing it. The
easiest Hottentot clicks, the dental and cerebral, have been adopted
by the Kaffirs; and it is a striking circumstance, in evidence of
the past Hottentot influence upon the Kaffir languages, that the
clicking decreases amongst these tribes almost in proportion to
their distance from the former Hottentot domain.

The language in its grammatical structure is beautiful and regular.
Dr Bleek describes it as having the distinctive features of the suffix-pronominal
order or higher form of languages, in which the pronouns
are identical with and borrowed from the derivative suffixes of the
nouns. The words are mostly monosyllables, always ending, with
two exceptions, in a vowel or nasal sound. Among the consonants
neither l, nor f nor v is found. There are two g&rsquo;s, g hard and g guttural,
and a deeper guttural kh. Diphthongs abound. There is no article,
but the definite or indefinite sense of a noun is determined by the
gender. In the fullest known dialect (that spoken by the Namaqua)
nouns are formed with eight different suffixes, which in nouns designating
persons distinguish masc. sing. (-b), masc. plur. (-ku), masc.
dual (kha), fem. sing, (-s), fem. plur. (-ti), com. sing. (-i), com. plur.
(-u), com. dual (-ra). The adjective is either prefixed to a noun
or referred to it by a suffixed pronoun. This grammatical division
of the nouns according to gender led to the classification of the
language as &ldquo;sex-denoting,&rdquo; thus suggesting its relationship, in
original structure, with the Galla and others.

There are four dialectical varieties of the language, each with
well-marked characteristics: the Nama dialect, spoken by the
Namaqua as well as by the Hau-Khoin or Hill Damara; the Kora
dialect, spoken by the Koranna, or Koraqua, dwelling about the
middle and upper part of the Orange, Vaal and Modder rivers;
the Eastern dialect, spoken by the Gona or Gonaqua on the borders
of Kaffirland; and the Cape dialect, now no longer spoken but
preserved in the records of early voyagers and settlers. Of the Nama
dialect there are three grammars: Wallmann&rsquo;s (1857) and Hahn&rsquo;s
in German, and Tindall&rsquo;s (1871) in English, the last being the best;
and the four Gospels, with a large amount of missionary literature,
have been published in it.

The vocabulary is not limited merely to the expression of the
rude conceptions that are characteristic of primitive races. It
possesses such words as koi, human being; khoi-si, kindly or friendly;
koi-si-b, philanthropist; khoi-si-s, humanity; &#9839; ei, to think;
&#9839; ei-s, thought; amo, eternal; amo-si-b, eternity; tsa, to feel;
tsa-b, feeling, sentiment; tsa-kha, to condole; ama, true; ama-b,
the truth; anu, sacred; anu-si-b, holiness; esa, pretty; anu-xa,
full of beauty.

Literature and History.&mdash;Much traditionary literature&mdash;fables,
myths and legends&mdash;existed amongst the Hottentots,&mdash;a fact first
made known by Sir James Alexander, who in his journeyings through
Great Namaqualand in 1835 jotted down the stories told him
around the camp fire by his Hottentot followers. These Hottentot
tales generally have much of the character of fables; some are in
many points identical with northern nursery tales, and suggestive
of European origin or of contact with the white man; but the
majority bear evidence of being true native products. Bleek&rsquo;s
Reynard the Fox in South Africa (1864) contains a translation of a
legend written down from the lips of the Namaqua by the Rev.
G. Krönlein, which is regarded as an excellent specimen of the
national style. Another legend relating to the moon and the hare
conveys the idea of an early conception of the hope of immortality.
It is found in various versions, and, like many other stories, occurs
in Bushman as well as in Hottentot mythology.

The earliest accounts of the Hottentots occur in the narratives of
Vasco da Gama&rsquo;s first voyage to India round the Cape in 1497-1498.
In 1510 the Portuguese viceroy, Francisco d&rsquo;Almeida, count of
Abrantes, met his death in a dispute with the natives. Till the 17th
century they were believed to be cannibals, but with the occupation
of the Cape by the Dutch, in 1652, more accurate knowledge was
obtained. A century of Dutch rule resulted in the Hottentots
becoming a nation of slaves and in serious danger of extermination,
and thus the arrival of the English in 1795 was welcomed by them.
In 1828 an ordinance was passed declaring &ldquo;all Hottentots and other
free persons of colour&rdquo; entitled to all and every right to which any
other British subjects were entitled. (See Cape Colony: History;
and South Africa.)

HOTTINGER, JOHANN HEINRICH (1620-1667), Swiss philologist
and theologian, was born at Zürich on the 10th of March
1620. He studied at Geneva, Groningen and Leiden, and after
visiting France and England was in 1642 appointed professor
of church history in his native town. The chair of Hebrew
at the Carolinum was added in 1643, and in 1653 he was appointed
professor ordinarius of logic, rhetoric and theology.
He gained such a reputation as an Oriental scholar that the
elector palatine in 1655 appointed him professor of Oriental
languages and biblical criticism at Heidelberg. In 1661, however,
he returned to Zürich, where in 1662 he was chosen principal of
the university. In 1667 he accepted an invitation to succeed
Johann Hoornbeck (1617-1666) as professor in the university
of Leiden, but he was drowned with three of his children by the
upsetting of a boat while crossing the river Limmat. His chief
works are Historia ecclesiastica Nov. Test. (1651-1667); Thesaurus
philologicus seu clavis scripturae (1649; 3rd ed. 1698); Etymologicon
orientale, sive lexicon harmonicum heptaglotton (1661).
He also wrote a Hebrew and an Aramaic grammar.

His son, Johann Jakob Hottinger (1652-1735), who became
professor of theology at Zürich in 1698, was the author of a work
against Roman Catholicism, Helvetische Kirchengeschichte (4 vols.,
1698-1729); and his grandson, Johann Heinrich Hottinger
(1681-1750), who in 1721 was appointed professor of theology
at Heidelberg, wrote a work on dogmatics, Typus doctrinae
christianae (1714).



HOUBRAKEN, JACOBUS (1698-1780), Dutch engraver,
was born at Dort, on the 25th of December 1698. All that his
father, Arnold Houbraken (1660-1719), bequeathed to him was
a fine constitution and a pure love for work. In 1707 he came
to reside at Amsterdam, where for years he had to struggle
incessantly against difficulties. He commenced the art of
engraving by studying the works of Cornelis Cort, Suyderhoef,
Edelinck and the Visschers. He devoted himself almost entirely
to portraiture. Among his best works are scenes from the
comedy of De Ontdekte Schijndeugd, executed in his eightieth
year, after Cornelis Troost, who was called by his countrymen
the Dutch Hogarth. He died on the 14th of November 1780.


See A. Ver Hull, Jacobus Houbraken et son &oelig;uvre (Arnhem, 1875),
where 120 engraved works are fully described.




HOUDENC (or Houdan), RAOUL DE, 12th-century French
trouvère, takes his name from his native place, generally
identified with Houdain (Artois), though there are twelve places
bearing the name in one or other of its numerous variants.
It has been suggested that he was a monk, but from the scattered
hints in his writings it seems more probable that he followed the
trade of jongleur and recited his chansons, with small success
apparently, in the houses of the great. He was well acquainted
with Paris, and probably spent a great part of his life there.
His undoubted works are: Le Songe d&rsquo;enfer, La Voie de paradis,
Le Roman des eles (pr. by A. Scheler in Trouvères belges, New
808
Series, 1897) and the romance of Méraugis de Portlesguez,
edited by M. Michelant (1869) and by Dr M. Friedwagner
(Halle, 1897). Houdenc was an imitator of Chrétien de Troyes;
and Huon de Méri, in his Tournoi de l&rsquo;antéchrist (1226) praises
him with Chrétien in words that seem to imply that both were
dead. Méraugis de Portlesguez, the hero of which perhaps
derives his name from Lesguez, the port of Saint Brieuc in
Brittany, is a roman d&rsquo;aventures loosely attached to the Arthurian
cycle.

(1885).




HOUDETOT, a French noble family, taking its name from
the lordship of Houdetot, between Arques and St Valéry.
Louis de Houdetot went with Robert, duke of Normandy, to
Palestine in 1034, and the various branches of the family trace
descent from Richard I. de Houdetot (fl. 1229), who married
Marie de Montfort. Charles Louis de Houdetot received a
marquisate in 1722, and on his son Claude Constance César,
lieutenant-general in the French army, was conferred the
hereditary title of count in 1753. His wife (see below) was
the Madame de Houdetot of Rousseau&rsquo;s Confessions. Their son
César Louis Marie François Ange, comte de Houdetot (1749-1825),
was governor of Martinique (1803-1809) and lieutenant-general
(1814) under the Empire. His son Frédéric Christophe, comte
de Houdetot (1778-1859), was director-general of indirect
imposts in Prussia after Jena, and prefect of Brussels in 1813.
He acquiesced in the Restoration, but had to resign from the
service after the Hundred Days. He became a peer of France
in 1819, and under the Second Empire he was returned by the
department of Calvados to the Corps Législatif. His half-brother,
Charles Île-de-France, comte de Houdetot (1789-1866), was
wounded at Trafalgar and transferred to the army, in which he
served through the Napoleonic wars. He retired at the Restoration,
but returned to the service in 1823, and in 1826 became
aide-de-camp to the duke of Orleans, becoming lieutenant-general
in 1842. He sat in the Chamber of Deputies from 1837 to 1848,
when he followed Louis Philippe into exile. A third brother,
César François Adolphe, comte de Houdetot (1799-1869), was
a well-known writer on military and other subjects.



HOUDETOT, ELISABETH FRANÇOISE SOPHIE DE LA LIVE DE BELLEGARDE,
Comtesse de (1730-1813), was born in
1730. She married the comte de Houdetot (see above) in 1748.
In 1753 she formed with the marquis de Saint Lambert (q.v.)
a connexion which lasted till his death. Mme de Houdetot
has been made famous by the chapter in Rousseau&rsquo;s Confessions
in which he describes his unreciprocated passion for her. When
questioned on the subject she replied that he had much exaggerated.
A view differing considerably from Rousseau&rsquo;s
is to be found in the Mémoires of Mme d&rsquo;Epinay, Mme de
Houdetot&rsquo;s sister-in-law.


For a discussion of her relations with Rousseau see Saint-Marc-Girardin
in the Revue des deux mondes (September 1853).




HOUDON, JEAN ANTOINE (1740-1828), French sculptor,
was born at Versailles on the 18th of March 1740. At the age
of twelve he entered the École royale de Sculpture, and at
twenty, having learnt all that he could from Michel Ange Slodtz
and Pigalle, he carried off the prix de Rome and left France for
Italy, where he spent the next ten years of his life. His brilliant
talent, which seems to have been formed by the influence of that
world of statues with which Louis XIV. peopled the gardens of
Versailles rather than by the lessons of his masters, delighted
Pope Clement XIV., who, on seeing the St Bruno executed
by Houdon for the church of St Maria degli Angeli, said &ldquo;he
would speak, were it not that the rules of his order impose silence.&rdquo;
In Italy Houdon had lived in the presence of that second
Renaissance with which the name of Winckelmann is associated,
and the direct and simple treatment of the Morpheus which he
sent to the Salon of 1771 bore witness to its influence. This
work procured him his &ldquo;agrégation&rdquo; to the Academy of Painting
and Sculpture, of which he was made a full member in 1775.
Between these dates Houdon had not been idle; busts of
Catharine II., Diderot and Prince Galitzin were remarked at the
Salon of 1773, and at that of 1775 he produced, not only his
Morpheus in marble, but busts of Turgot, Gluck (in which the
marks of small-pox in the face were reproduced with striking
effect) and Sophie Arnould as Iphigeneia (now in the Wallace
Collection, London), together with his well-known marble relief,
&ldquo;Grive suspendue par les pattes.&rdquo; He took also an active part
in the teaching of the academy, and executed for the instruction
of his pupils the celebrated Écorché still in use. To every Salon
Houdon was a chief contributor; most of the leading men of
the day were his sitters; his busts of d&rsquo;Alembert, Prince Henry
of Prussia, Gerbier, Buffon (for Catharine of Russia) and Mirabeau
are remarkable portraits; and in 1778, when the news of
Rousseau&rsquo;s death reached him, Houdon started at once for
Ermenonville, and there took a cast of the dead man&rsquo;s face, from
which he produced the grand and life-like head now in the Louvre.
In 1779 his bust of Molière, at the Théâtre Français, won universal
praise, and the celebrated draped statue of Voltaire, in the
vestibule of the same theatre, was exhibited at the Salon of 1781,
to which Houdon also sent a statue of Marshal de Tourville, commissioned
by the king, and the Diana executed for Catharine II.
This work was refused; the jury alleged that a statue of Diana
demanded drapery; without drapery, they said, the goddess
became a &ldquo;suivante de Vénus,&rdquo; and not even the proud and
frank chastity of the attitude and expression could save the
Diana of Houdon (a bronze reproduction of which is in the
Louvre) from insult. Three years later he went to America, there
to carry out a statue of Washington. With Franklin, whose bust he
had recently executed, Houdon left France in 1785, and, staying
some time with Washington at Mount Vernon, he modelled
the bust, with which he decided to go back to Paris, there
to complete the statue destined for the capitol of the State
of Virginia. After his return to his native country Houdon
executed for the king of Prussia, as a companion to a statue of
Summer, La Frileuse, a naif embodiment of shivering cold,
which is one of his best as well as one of his best-known works.
The Revolution interrupted the busy flow of commissions, and
Houdon took up a half-forgotten project for a statue of St
Scholastica. He was immediately denounced to the convention,
and his life was only saved by his instant and ingenious adaptation
of St Scholastica into an embodiment of Philosophy. Under
Napoleon, of whom in 1806 he made a nude statue now at Dijon,
Houdon received little employment; he was, however, commissioned
to execute the colossal reliefs intended for the decoration
of the column of the &ldquo;Grand Army&rdquo; at Boulogne (which
ultimately found a different destination); he also produced a
statue of Cicero for the senate, and various busts, amongst
which may be cited those of Marshal Ney, of Josephine and of
Napoleon himself, by whom Houdon was rewarded with the
legion of honour. He died at Paris on the 16th of July 1828.

HOUFFALIZE, a small town occupying an elevated position
(nearly 1100 ft.) in the extreme south-east of the province of
Luxemburg, Belgium, much visited during the summer on
account of its fine bracing air. There are the ruins of an old
castle, and some remains of the still older abbey of Val Ste
Catherine. The parish church dates from the 13th or 14th
century. It contains two old black marble tombs to Thierry of
Houffalize and Henri his son, the latter killed at Woeringen in
1288. Houffalize is on the eastern Ourthe, and is connected
by a steam tramway with Bourcy on the line from Libramont
to Bastogne, Spa and Liége. Pop. (1904) 1486.



HOUGHTON, RICHARD MONCKTON MILNES, 1st Baron
(1809-1885), English poet and man of letters, son of Robert
Pemberton Milnes, of Fryston Hall, Yorkshire, and the Hon.
Henrietta Monckton, daughter of the fourth Lord Galway, was
born in London on the 19th of June 1809. He was educated
809
privately, and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1827.
There he was at once drawn into a literary set, and became a
member of the famous &ldquo;Apostles&rdquo; Club, which then included
Tennyson, Hallam, Trench, J. W. Blakesley, afterwards dean of
Lincoln, and others. After taking his degree, Milnes travelled
abroad, spending some time at Bonn University. Thence
he went to Italy and Greece, and published in 1834 a volume
of Memorials of a Tour in some Parts of Greece, describing his
experiences. He returned to London in 1837, and was in that
year elected to Parliament as member for Pontefract. His
parliamentary career was marked by much strenuous activity.
He interested himself particularly in the question of copyright
and the conditions of reformatory schools. He left Peel&rsquo;s party
over the Corn Law controversy, and was afterwards identified
in politics with Palmerston, at whose instance he was made a
peer in 1863. His literary career was industrious and cultured,
without being exceptionally distinguished. Church matters
had always a claim upon him: he wrote a striking tract in
1841, which was praised by Newman; and took part in the
discussion about &ldquo;Essays and Reviews,&rdquo; defending the tractarian
position in One Tract More (1841). He published two volumes
of verse in 1838, Memorials of Residence upon the Continent and
Poems of Many Years, Poetry for the People in 1840 and Palm
Leaves in 1844. He also wrote a Life and Letters of Keats in 1848,
the material for which was largely provided by the poet&rsquo;s friend,
Charles Armitage Brown. Milnes also contributed largely to
the reviews. His poetry is meditative and delicate; some of
his ballads were among the most popular of their day, and all
his work was marked by refinement. But his chief distinctions
were his keen sense of literary merit in others, and the judgment
and magnanimity with which he fostered it. He was surrounded
by the most brilliant men of his time, many of whom he had been
the first to acclaim. His chief title to remembrance rests on the
part he played, as a man of influence in society and in moulding
public opinion on literary matters, in connexion with his large
circle of talented friends. He secured a pension for Tennyson,
helped to make Emerson known in Great Britain, and was one
of the earliest champions of Swinburne. He helped David Gray
and wrote a preface for The Luggie. He was, in the old sense of
the word, a patron of letters, and one who never abused the
privileges of his position. Milnes married in 1851 the Hon.
Annabel Crewe (d. 1874). He died at Vichy on the 11th
of August 1885, and was buried at Fryston. His son, the
second Baron Houghton, was created Earl of Crewe (q.v.) in
1895.

first Lord Houghton (1890), by Sir T. Wemyss Reid.




HOUGHTON-LE-SPRING, an urban district in the Houghton-le-Spring
parliamentary division of Durham, England, 6 m. N.E.
of the city of Durham. Pop. (1901) 7858. It is well situated
at the head of a small valley branching from that of the Wear.
St Michael&rsquo;s church is a cruciform Early English and Decorated
building, with a picturesque embattled rectory adjoining.
Bernard Gilpin, &ldquo;the Apostle of the North,&rdquo; was rector of this
parish from 1556 to 1583, and the founder of the grammar school.
The principal public buildings are a town hall, market house
and church institute. Houghton Hall is a fine mansion of the
late 16th century. In the orchard stands a tomb, that of the
puritan Sir Robert Hutton (d. 1680), of whom a curious tradition
states that he desired burial beside his war-horse, the body of
which was denied interment in consecrated ground. The main
road from Durham to Sunderland here passes through a remarkable
cutting in the limestone 80 ft. deep. The district affords
frequent evidence of ice activity in the glacial period. The
town is the centre of a large system of electric tramways. The
population is mainly dependent on the neighbouring collieries,
but limestone quarrying is carried on to some extent.



HOUND, a dog, now used, except in poetry, only of dogs of
the chase, and particularly of the breed used in hunting the fox,
the &ldquo;hound&rdquo; par excellence. Other breeds have a defining
word prefixed, e.g. boar-hound, stag-hound, &amp;c. (see Dog).
The O. Eng. hund is the common Teutonic name for the animal,
cf. Du. hond, Ger. Hund, &amp;c., and is cognate with Sansk. çvan,
Gr. &#954;&#973;&#969;&#957;, Lat. canis, Ir. and Gael. cu.



HOUNSLOW, a town in the Brentford parliamentary division
of Middlesex, England, 12½ m. W. by S. of St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral,
London, on the District and London &amp; South Western railways.
Pop. (1901) 11,377. It has grown into an extensive residential
suburb of London. Its situation at the junction of two great
roads from the west of England made it an important coaching
station, and some 500 coaches formerly passed through it daily.
A priory of friars of the Holy Trinity was founded at Hounslow
in 1296, and existed till the dissolution of the monasteries.
The priory chapel was used as a church till 1830, after which
its place was taken by the existing church of the Holy Trinity
(1835). Hounslow Heath, west of the town, had, according to
the survey of 1546, an area of 4293 acres. It was the site of
Roman and British camps, and in the wars of the 17th century
was the scene of several important military rendezvous. It
was a favourite resort of highwaymen, whose bodies were
exposed on gibbets along the road. In 1784 the base-line of the
first trigonometrical survey in England was laid down on the
heath. In 1793 large cavalry barracks were erected upon it,
and it is also the site of extensive powder mills. It began to be
enclosed towards the end of the reign of George III. In Osterley
Park, N.E. of Hounslow, Sir Thomas Gresham built a mansion
in 1577, and this was rebuilt with great magnificence by Francis
and Robert Child c. 1770. Hounslow is divided between the
parishes of Heston and Isleworth. Pop. of urban district of
Heston and Isleworth (1901) 30,863.



HOUR, the twenty-fourth part of a civil day, the twelfth
part of a natural day or night, a space of time of sixty minutes&rsquo;
duration. The word is derived through the O. Fr. ure, ore,
houre, mod. heure, from Lat. hora, Gr. &#8037;&#961;&#945;, season, time of day,
hour (see Calendar).



HOUR ANGLE, the angular distance of a heavenly body from
the meridian, as measured around the celestial pole. It is
equal to the angle at the pole between the hour circle through
the body and the meridian, but is usually expressed in time.



HOUR-GLASS, a device for measuring intervals of time, also
known as sand-glass, and as log-glass when used in conjunction
with the common log for ascertaining the speed of a ship. It
consists of two pear-shaped bulbs of glass, united at their apices
and having a minute passage formed between them. A quantity
of sand (or occasionally of mercury) is enclosed in the bulbs,
and the size of the passage is so proportioned that this sand will
completely run through from one bulb to another in the time
it is desired to measure&mdash;e.g. an hour or a minute. Instruments
of this kind, which have no great pretensions to accuracy, were
formerly common in churches. In the English House of Commons,
as a preliminary to a division, a two-minute sand-glass is still
turned, and while the sand is running the &ldquo;division bells&rdquo; are
set in motion in every part of the building, to give members
notice that a division is at hand.



HOURI, the term for a beautiful virgin who awaits the
devout Mahommedan in Paradise. The word is the French
representative of the Pers. h&#363;r&#299;, Arab, hawr&#257;&lsquo;, a black-eyed
virgin, from hawira, to be black-eyed, like a gazelle.



HOURS, CANONICAL, certain portions of the day set apart by
rule (canon) of the church for prayer and devotion. The Jewish
custom of praying three times a day, i.e. at the third, sixth and
ninth hours, was perpetuated in the early Christian Church
(Acts ii. 15, iii. 1, x. 9), and to these were added midnight (when
Paul and Silas sang in prison), and the beginning of day and of
night. Ambrose, Augustine and Hilary commended the example
of the psalmist who gave praise &ldquo;seven times a day&rdquo; (Ps. cxix.
164). The seventh (Compline, Completorium) was added by
Benedict. These hours were adopted especially in the monasteries
as a part of the canonical life, and spread thence to the cathedral
and collegiate chapters.

Since the 6th century the number and order of the hours have
been fixed thus: matins, lauds, prime, terce, sext, none,
vespers, compline.

Matins theoretically belongs to midnight, but in Italy it is
810
said about 7 or 8 A.M. and in France often on the preceding
evening in accordance with the statement &ldquo;evening and morning
were one day.&rdquo; At matins is said the Venite (Ps. xcv.) and a
hymn, followed by a Nocturna or night-watch (on Sundays three)
which consists of twelve psalms. After the nocturna comes a
lesson divided into three parts, one biblical and two patristic, and
finally the Te Deum.

Lauds is proper to sunrise, but is mostly grouped with matins.
It consists of four psalms, a canticle, psalms 148-150, a hymn,
the Benedictus (Luke i. 68-79) and prayers.

Prime (6 A.M.), Terce (9 A.M.), Sext (noon) and None (3 P.M.)
are called the Little Day Hours, are often said together, and
are alike in character, consisting of a hymn and some sections
of Ps. cxix., followed by a prayer. On Sundays the Athanasian
Creed is said at prime.

Vespers or Evensong consists of five varying psalms, a hymn,
the Magnificat (Luke i. 46-55) and prayers. It belongs theoretically
to sunset.

Compline, technically 9 P.M., but usually combined with
vespers, is a prayer for protection during the darkness. It consists
of the general confession, four fixed psalms, a hymn, the
Nunc dimittis (Luke ii. 29-32), prayers and a Commemoration
of the Virgin.


The term &ldquo;canonical hours&rdquo; is also used of the time during which
English marriages may be solemnized without special licence, i.e.
between 8 A.M. and 3 P.M.




HOUSE (O. Eng. hús, a word common to Teutonic languages,
cf. Dut. huis, Ger. Haus; in Gothic it is only found in gudhûs,
a temple; it may be ultimately connected with the root of
&ldquo;hide,&rdquo; conceal), the dwelling-place of a human being (treated,
from the architectural point of view, below), or, in a transferred
sense, of an animal, particularly of one whose abode, like that
of the beaver, is built by the animal itself, or, like that of the
snail, resembles in some fancied way a human dwelling. Apart
from the numerous compound uses of the word, denoting the
purpose for which a building is employed, such as custom-house,
lighthouse, bakehouse, greenhouse and the like, there may be
mentioned the particular applications to a chamber of a legislative
body, the Houses of Parliament, House of Representatives, &amp;c.;
to the upper and lower assemblies of convocation; and to the
colleges at a university; the heads of these foundations, known
particularly as master, principal, president, provost, rector, &amp;c.,
are collectively called heads of houses. At English public
schools a &ldquo;house&rdquo; is the usual unit of the organization. In the
&ldquo;houses&rdquo; the boys sleep, have their &ldquo;studies&rdquo; and their meals,
if the school is arranged on the &ldquo;boarding-house&rdquo; system.
The houses have their representative teams in the school games,
but have no place in the educational class-system of the school.
It may be noticed that in Scotland the words &ldquo;house&rdquo; and
&ldquo;tenement&rdquo; are used in a way distinct from the English use,
&ldquo;tenement&rdquo; being applied to the large block containing
&ldquo;houses,&rdquo; portions, i.e., occupied by separate families. &ldquo;The
House&rdquo; is the name colloquially given to such different institutions
as the London Stock Exchange, the House of Commons or
Lords and to a workhouse.

In the transferred sense, &ldquo;house&rdquo; is used of a family, genealogically
considered, and of the audience at a public meeting or
entertainment, especially of a theatre. A &ldquo;house-physician&rdquo;
and &ldquo;house-surgeon&rdquo; is a member of the resident medical staff
of a hospital. In astrology the twelve divisions into which the
heavens are divided, and through which the planets pass, are
known as houses, the first being called the &ldquo;house of life.&rdquo;
The word &ldquo;house,&rdquo; &ldquo;housing,&rdquo; used of the trappings of a horse,
especially of a covering for the back and flanks, attached to the
saddle, is of quite distinct origin. In medieval Latin it appears
as hucia, houssia and housia (see Ducange, Glossarium, s.v.
housia), and comes into English from the O. Fr. huche, modern
housse. It has been supposed to have been adopted, at the time
of the crusades, from the Arabic yushiah, a covering.

Architecturally considered, the term &ldquo;house&rdquo; is given to a
building erected for habitation, in contradistinction to one built
for secular or ecclesiastical purposes. The term extends, therefore,
to a dwelling of any size, from a single-room building to one
containing as many rooms as a palace; thus in London some
of the largest dwellings are those inhabited by royalty, such as
Marlborough House, or others by men of rank, such as Devonshire
House, Bridgewater House, Spencer House, &amp;c.; and even
those which, formerly built as habitations, have subsequently
been devoted to other purposes, such as Somerset House and
Burlington House, retain the term. In Paris the larger houses
thus named would be called hôtel.

So far as the history of domestic architecture is concerned, the
earliest houses of which remains have been found are those of the
village of Kahun in Egypt, which were built for the workmen
employed in the building of the pyramid at Illahun, and deserted
on its completion. They varied in size from the habitations of
the chief inspectors to the single room of the ordinary labourer,
and were built in unburnt brick with open courts in the larger
examples, to give light and air to the rooms round. The models
found in 1907 at Deir-Rifa opposite Assiut in Upper Egypt,
by Flinders Petrie, and assumed by him to be those of &ldquo;soul-houses,&rdquo;
suggest that the early type of building consisted of a
hut, to which later a porch or lean-to, with two poles in front,
has been added; subsequently, columns replaced the poles, and
a flat roof with parapet, suggesting the primitive forms of the
Egyptian temple.

The only remains of early houses found in Mesopotamia are
those within the precincts of the Temple of Bel, at Nippur,
occupied by the king; but beyond the fact that the walls were
built in unburnt brick and were sometimes of great thickness,
nothing is known.

The houses in Crete would seem to have been small in area,
but this was compensated for in height, as the small plaques
found in the palace at Cnossus show houses in two or three
storeys, with gable roofs and windows subdivided by mullions and
transomes, corresponding with those of the 15th to 17th centuries
in England. The stone staircase in the palace rising through
two storeys shows that even at this early period the houses in
towns had floors superposed one above the other; to a certain
extent the same extension existed in the later Greek houses found
in Delos, in two of which there was clear evidence of wooden
staircases leading within to the roof or to an upper storey.
The largest series hitherto discovered is that at Priene in Asia
Minor, where the remains of some thirty examples were found,
varying in dimensions, but all based on the same plan; this
consisted of an entrance passage leading to an open court, on
the north side of which, and therefore facing south, was an open
portico, corresponding to the prostas in Vitruvius (vi. 7), and in
the rear two large rooms, one of which might be the oecus or
sitting-room, and the other the thalamos or chief bedroom.
Other rooms round the court were the triclinium, or dining
room, and cubicula or bedchambers. The largest of these
houses occupied an area measuring 75 × 30 ft. Those found in
Delos, though fewer in number, are of much greater importance,
the house in the street of the theatre having twelve rooms
exclusive of the entrance passage and the great central court,
surrounded on all four sides by a peristyle; in this house the
oecus measured 26 × 18 ft. In a second example the prostas
consisted of a long gallery, the whole width of the site, which was
lighted by windows at each end, the sills of which were raised
8 ft. or 9 ft. from the floor.

The remains of the houses found in the Peiraeus are of the
same simple plan as those at Priene, and suggest that the Greek
house was considered to be the private residence only for the
members of the family, and without any provision for entertaining
guests as in Rome and Pompeii. From the descriptions given
by Vitruvius (ii. 8) it may be gathered that in his time many
of the houses in Rome were built in unburnt brick, the walls of
which, if properly protected at the top with a course of burnt
brick projecting over the face of the brickwork, and coated
inside and outside with stucco, were considered to be more
lasting than those built in soft stone. Vitruvius refers also to
Greek houses thus built, and states that in the house of Mausolus,
at Halicarnassus, the walls were of unburnt brick, and the
811
plastering with which they were covered was so polished that
they sparkled like glass. In Rome, however, he points out, such
walls ought to be forbidden, as they are not fit to carry an
upper storey, unless they are of great thickness, and as upper
storeys become necessary in a crowded city such walls would
occupy too much space. The houses in Pompeii (q.v.) were
built in rubble masonry with clay mortar, and their walls were
protected at the top by burnt brick courses and their faces with
stucco; they were, however, of a second- or third-rate class
compared with those in Rome, the magnificence of which is
attested in the descriptions given by various writers and substantiated
by the remains occasionally found in excavations.
Vitruvius refers to upper storeys, which were necessary in
consequence of the limited area in Rome, and representations
in mosaic floors and in bas-relief sculpture have been found on
which two or three storeys are indicated. The plans of many
Roman houses are shown on the Marble Plan, and they resemble
those of Pompeii, but it is probable that the principal reception
rooms were on an upper storey, long since destroyed. The house
of Livia on the Palatine Hill was in two storeys, and the decoration
was of a much finer character than those of Pompeii; this
house and the House of the Vestals might be taken as representative
of the Roman house in Rome itself. In those built in colder
climates, as in England and Germany, account has to be taken
of the special provision required for warming the rooms by
hypocausts, of which numerous examples have been found,
with rich mosaic floors over them.

Of the houses in succeeding centuries, those found in the
cities of central Syria, described in the article Architecture,
are wonderfully perfect, in consequence of their desertion at
the time of the Mahommedan invasion in the 7th century.
Very little is known of the houses in Europe during the dark
ages, owing to the fact that they were generally built in wood,
with thatched roofs. The only examples in stone which have
been preserved are those in the island of Skellig Michael, Kerry,
which were constructed like the beehive tombs at Mycenae
with stone courses overlapping inside until they closed in at the
top. These houses or cells were rectangular inside and round
or oval outside, with a small low door at one end, and an opening
above to let the smoke out.

The houses, even in large towns like London, were built mainly
in wood, in some cases down to the 17th century; in the country,
the smaller houses were constructed with trunks of trees in
pairs, one end of the trunk being sunk in the ground, the other
bent over and secured by a ridge piece, thus forming a pointed
arch, the opening of which was about 11 ft. The pairs were
fixed 16 ft. apart, and the space included constituted a bay, any
requisite increase in the size of the house being made by doubling
or trebling the bays. The roofs were thatched with straw on
battens, and sometimes with a collar beam carrying a floor,
which constituted an upper storey. The end walls were closed
with wooden studs and wattle-and-daub filling. The pairs of
trees were known as forks or crucks. Vitruvius (ii. 1) suggests
a similar kind of building in ancient times, except that the
interlaced twigs were covered with clay, so as to carry off the
rain. In Yorkshire there was another type of house, known as
a coit, which was a dwelling-house and barn (shippon) united;
the latter contained the cow-stalls with loft above, and the
former was in two storeys, with a ladder inside the room leading
to the upper floor.1



Fig. 1.&mdash;Houses at Cluny.

Passing now to structures of a less ephemeral character, the
earliest houses of which there still remain substantial relics are
those built in stone (see Manor House). The Jew&rsquo;s House at
Lincoln, 12th century, is one of the best-known examples, and
still preserves its street front in stone, with rich entrance doorway
and first-floor windows lighting the principal room, which
seems invariably in those early houses to have been on the first
floor, the ground floor being used for service and stores (see
Plate I. fig. 5). To the 13th century belongs the old Rectory
House at West Dean, Sussex, and to the 14th century the
Parsonage House at Market Deeping, Lincolnshire. The principal
examples of the domestic architecture of this early period in the
country are castles, manor houses and farm buildings, as town
houses occupied sites too valuable to be left untouched; this,
however, is not the case in France, and particularly in the
south, where streets of early houses are still to be found in good
preservation, such as those at Cluny (fig. 1) and Cordes (Tarn),
and others at Montferrand, Cahors, Figeac, Angers, Provins,
Sarlat (fig. 2), St Emilion, Périgueux, Soissons and Beauvais,
dating from the 12th to the 14th centuries. One of the most
remarkable examples is the Musician&rsquo;s House at Reims (see
Plate I., fig. 4), with large windows on the first floor, between
which are niches with life-size figures of musicians seated in
them. Generally speaking, the ground storeys of these houses,
which in many cases were occupied by shops, have been transformed,
but occasionally the old shop fronts remain, as in
Dinan, Morlaix and other old towns in Brittany. Houses of
the first Renaissance of great beauty exist in Orleans, such as
the house of Agnes Sorel; and the example in the Market Place
illustrated in fig. 3; in Tours, Tristan&rsquo;s house in brick with stone
quoins and dressings to windows; in Rouen, Caen, Bayeux,
Toulouse, Dijon and, in fact, in almost every town throughout
France. Of houses of large dimensions, which in France are
termed hôtels, there are also many other fine examples, the best
known of which are the hôtel de Jacques C&oelig;ur (see Plate II.,
fig. 7), at Bourges, and the hôtel de Cluny at Paris (see
Plate I., fig. 6). In the 15th and 16th centuries in France,
owing to the value of the sites in towns, the houses rose to many
storeys, the upper of which were built in half-timber, sometimes
projecting on corbels and richly carved; of these numerous
examples exist at Rouen, Beauvais, Bayeux and other towns in
Normandy and Brittany. Of such structures in English towns
(see Plate II. fig. 9) there are still preserved some examples
in York, Southampton, Chester, Shrewsbury, Stratford-on-Avon,
and many smaller towns; the greatest development in
half-timber houses in England is that which is found more
particularly throughout Kent, Sussex and Surrey, in houses of
modest dimensions, generally consisting of ground and first floor
only, with sometimes additional rooms in the roof; in these the
upper storey invariably projects in front of the lower, giving
increased dimensions to the rooms in the former, but adopted in
order to protect the walls of the ground storey from rain, which
in the upper storey was effected by the projecting eaves of the
roof. In the north and west of England, where stone could
be obtained at less cost than brick, and in the east of England,
where brick, often imported from the Low Countries, was largely
employed, the ordinary houses were built in those materials,
812
and in consequence of their excellent construction many houses
of the 16th and 17th centuries have remained in good preservation
down to the present day; they are found in the Cotswolds
generally, and (among small towns) at Broadway in Worcestershire
and (of brick) throughout Essex and Suffolk. Among the
larger half-timber houses built in the 15th and 16th centuries,
mention may be made of Bramhall Hall, near Manchester;
Speke Hall, near Liverpool (see Plate III., fig. 10); The Oaks;
West Bromwich; and Moreton Old Hall, Cheshire, one of the
most elaborate of the series (see Plate III., fig. 11).



Fig. 2.&mdash;House at Sarlat.

On the borders of the Rhine, as at Bacharach and Rhense,
and throughout Germany, hall-timber houses of the most
picturesque character are found in every town, large and small,
those of Hildesheim (see Plate II., fig. 8) dating from the 15th
and 16th centuries, and in some cases rising to a great height
with four or five storeys, not including those in the lofty roofs.
Houses in stone from the 12th to the 16th century are found in
Cologne, Metz, Trier, Hanover and Münster in Westphalia,
where again there are whole streets remaining; and in brick
at Rostock, Stralsund, Lübeck, Greifswald and Dantzig, forming
a very remarkable series of 15th and 16th-century work.

Of half-timber work in Italy there are no examples, but
sometimes (as at Bologna) the rooms of the upper floors are
carried on arcades, and sometimes on corbels, as the casa dei
Carracci in the same town. The principal feature of the Italian
house is the courtyard in the rear, with arcades on one or more
sides, the front in stone or brick, or both combined, being of the
greatest simplicity (examples in San Gimignano and Pisa). At
Viterbo are small houses in stone, two of which have external
stone staircases of fine design, and the few windows on the
ground floor suggest that the rooms there were used only for stores.
Houses with external staircases, but without any architectural
pretensions, are found throughout the Balkan provinces.



Fig. 3.&mdash;Detail of house at Orleans.

The introduction of the purer Italian style into England in the
17th century created a great change in domestic architecture.
Instead of the projecting wings and otherwise picturesque
contour of the earlier work the houses were made square or
rectangular on plan, in two or three storeys, crowned with a
modillion cornice carrying a roof of red tiles; the only embellishments
of the main front were the projecting courses of stone
on the quoins and architraves round the windows, and flat
pilasters carrying a hood or pediment flanking the entrance
doorway. In the larger mansions more thought was bestowed
on the introduction of porticoes (scarcely necessary in the
English climate), with sometimes great flights of steps up to the
principal floor, which was raised above a basement with cold
and dark passages; a great saloon in the centre of the block,
lighted from above, took the place of the great entrance hall of
the Tudor period, and the rooms frequently led one out of the
other, without an independent entrance door. On the other hand,
in the ordinary houses, the deficiency in external ornament
was amply made up for by the comfort in the interior and the
decoration of the staircase and other rooms. Towards the close
of the century the square mullioned and transomed windows,
with opening casements, gave way to sash windows, introduced
from Holland, and these with moulded and stout sash-bars gave
a certain character to the outside of the houses, which are valued
now for their quiet unpretentious character and excellent construction.
In the closes of many English cathedrals, on the
outskirts of London, and in some of the older squares, as Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn Fields and Queen Square, are examples of this style of
house. The substitution of thin sash-bars in the 19th century,
813
and their omission occasionally, in favour of plate-glass, deprived
the house-front of one of its chief attractions; but the old
English casements and oriels or bow-windows have been again
introduced, and a return has been made to the style which
prevailed in the beginning of the 18th century, commonly known
as that of Queen Anne.

Perhaps in one respect the greatest change which has been
made in the English house is the adoption of &ldquo;flats&rdquo;; commenced
some time in the &rsquo;fifties in Ashley Gardens, Westminster,
they have spread throughout London. In consequence of the
great value of the sites on which they are sometimes built, to
which must be added the cost of the houses pulled down to
make way for them, the question of expense in material and
rich decoration has not always been worth considering, so that
frontages in stone, with the classic orders brought in with
many varieties of design, have given the character of a palace
to a structure in which none of the rooms exceeds the modest
height of 10 ft. The increasing demand for these, however,
shows that they meet, so far as their accommodation and comfort
are concerned, the wants and tastes of the upper and middle
classes. In some of the London streets, where shops occupy the
ground floor, a far finer type of house has been erected than that
which could have been afforded for the shopkeeper&rsquo;s residence
above, as in old times, so that London promises in time to
become a city of palaces. The same change in the aspects of
its streets has long been evident in Paris, but there is one feature
in the latter city which has never yet found its way into London,
much to the surprise of French visitors, viz. the porte-cochère,
through which the occupants of the house can in wet weather
drive and be landed in a covered hall or vestibule. This requires,
of course, a small court at the back, so small that one wonders
sometimes how it is possible for the carriage to turn round in it.
The porte-cochère also, from its dimensions, is a feature of more
importance than the ordinary street doorway, even when a
portico of some kind is added; on the other hand, the strict
regulations in Paris as regards the projection of cornices and
other decorative accessories gives to the stranger the appearance
of monotony in their design, which certainly cannot be said of
the houses in flats lately built in London. Within recent years
an old English feature, known as the bow-window, has been
introduced into Paris, the primary object of which does not
seem yet to have been thoroughly understood by the French
architect. An English bow-window, by its slight projection in
front of the main wall, increases greatly the amount of light
entering the room, and it is generally placed between solid piers
of stone or brick. The French architects, however, project
their piers on immense corbels, and then sink their windows
with deep external reveals, so that no benefit accrues to the
room, so far as the increased light is concerned. In Paris, since
1900, there has been a tendency to introduce a style of design in
French houses which is known as &ldquo;l&rsquo;art nouveau,&rdquo; a style
which commenced in furniture as a reaction against the revival
of the Empire and Louis XIV. and XVI. periods, and was then
extended to house fronts; this style has unfortunately spread
through the various towns in France and apparently to Germany,
again as a reaction against the formal classic style of the latter
half of the 19th century. It is probable that in Italy and Spain
&ldquo;l&rsquo;art nouveau&rdquo; may meet with the same success, and for the
same reasons, so that in the latter country it will be a revival,
with modifications, of the well-known Churrigueresque style,
the most debased Rococo style which has ever existed. In
England it has never met with any response.

Evolution of the English House, by S. O. Addy.




HOUSEHOLD, ROYAL. In all the medieval monarchies of
western Europe the general system of government sprang from,
and centred in, the royal household. The sovereign&rsquo;s domestics
were his officers of state, and the leading dignitaries of the
palace were the principal administrators of the kingdom. The
royal household itself had, in its turn, grown out of an earlier and
more primitive institution. It took its rise in the comitatus
described by Tacitus, the chosen band of comites or companions
who, when the Roman historian wrote, constituted the personal
following, in peace as well as in war, of the Teutonic chieftain. In
England before the Conquest the comitatus had developed or
degenerated into the thegnhood, and among the most eminent and
powerful of the king&rsquo;s thegns were his dishthegn, his bowerthegn,
and his horsethegn or staller. In Normandy at the time of the
Conquest a similar arrangement, imitated from the French
court, had long been established, and the Norman dukes, like
their overlords the kings of France, had their seneschal or
steward, their chamberlain and their constable. After the
Conquest the ducal household of Normandy was reproduced in
the royal household of England; and since, in obedience to
the spirit of feudalism, the great offices of the first had been
made hereditary, the great offices of the second were made
hereditary also, and were thenceforth held by the grantees and
their descendants as grand-serjeanties of the crown. The consequence
was that they passed out of immediate relation to the
practical conduct of affairs either in both state and court or in
the one or the other of them. The steward and chamberlain of
England were superseded in their political functions by the
justiciar and treasurer of England, and in their domestic functions
by the steward and chamberlain of the household. The marshal
of England took the place of the constable of England in the
royal palace, and was associated with him in the command of
the royal armies. In due course, however, the marshalship as
well as the constableship became hereditary, and, although the
constable and marshal of England retained their military
authority until a comparatively late period, the duties they had
successively performed about the palace had been long before
transferred to the master of the horse. In these circumstances
the holders of the original great offices of state and the household
ceased to attend the court except on occasions of extraordinary
ceremony, and their representatives either by inheritance or by
special appointment have ever since continued to appear at
coronations and some other public solemnities, such as the
opening of the parliament or trials by the House of Lords.1

The materials available for a history of the English royal
household are somewhat scanty and obscure. The earliest
record relating to it is of the reign of Henry II. and is contained
in the Black Book of the Exchequer. It enumerates the various
inmates of the king&rsquo;s palace and the daily allowances made to
them at the period at which it was compiled. Hence it affords
valuable evidence of the antiquity and relative importance of the
court offices to which it refers, notwithstanding that it is silent
as to the functions and formal subordination of the persons who
filled them.2 In addition to this record we have a series of far
later, but for the most part equally meagre, documents bearing
more or less directly on the constitution of the royal household,
and extending, with long intervals, from the reign of Edward III.
to the reign of William and Mary.3 Among them, however, are
what are known as the Black Book of the Household and the
Statutes of Eltham, the first compiled in the reign of Edward IV.
and the second in the reign of Henry VIII., from which a good
deal of detailed information may be gathered concerning the
arrangements of the court in the 15th and 16th centuries. The
Statutes of Eltham were meant for the practical guidance merely
of those who were responsible for the good order and the sufficient
supply of the sovereign&rsquo;s household at the time they were issued.
814
But the Black Book of the Household, besides being a sort of
treatise on princely magnificence generally, professes to be based
on the regulations established for the governance of the court by
Edward III., who, it affirms, was &ldquo;the first setter of certeynties
among his domesticall meyne, upon a grounded rule&rdquo; and
whose palace it describes as &ldquo;the house of very policie and
flowre of England&rdquo;; and it may therefore possibly, and even
probably, take us back to a period much more remote than that
at which it was actually put together.4 Various orders, returns
and accounts of the reigns of Elizabeth, James I., Charles I.,
Charles II., and William and Mary throw considerable light on
the organization of particular sections of the royal household in
times nearer to our own.5 Moreover, there were several parliamentary
inquiries into the expenses of the royal household in
connexion with the settlement or reform of the civil list during
the reigns of George III., George IV. and William IV.6 But they
add little or nothing to our knowledge of the subject in what
was then its historical as distinguished from its contemporary
aspects. So much, indeed, is this the case that, on the accession
of Queen Victoria, Chamberlayne&rsquo;s Present State of England,
which contains a catalogue of the officials at the court of Queen
Anne, was described by Lord Melbourne the prime minister as the
&ldquo;only authority&rdquo; which the advisers of the crown could find for
their assistance in determining the appropriate constitution and
dimensions of the domestic establishment of a queen regnant.7

In its main outlines the existing organization of the royal
household is essentially the same as it was under the Tudors or
the Plantagenets. It is now, as it was then, divided into three
principal departments, at the head of which are severally the
lord steward, the lord chamberlain and the master of the horse,
and the respective provinces of which may be generally described
as &ldquo;below stairs,&rdquo; &ldquo;above stairs&rdquo; and &ldquo;out of doors.&rdquo; The
duties of these officials, and the various officers under their
charge are dealt with in the articles under those headings. When
the reigning sovereign is a queen, the royal household is in some
other respects rather differently arranged from that of a king and
a queen consort. When there is a king and a queen consort there
is a separate establishment &ldquo;above stairs&rdquo; and &ldquo;out of doors&rdquo;
for the queen consort. She has a lord chamberlain&rsquo;s department
of her own, and all the ladies of the court from the mistress of the
robes to the maids of honour are in her service. At the commencement
of the reign of Queen Victoria the two establishments
were combined, and on the whole considerably reduced. On the
accession of Edward VII. the civil list was again reconstituted;
and while the household of the king and his consort became larger
than during the previous reign, there was a tendency towards
increased efficiency by abolishing certain offices which were
either redundant or unnecessary.

The royal households of such of the continental monarchies
of Europe as have had a continuous history from medieval times
resemble in general outlines that described above. There are,
common to many, certain great offices, which have become,
in course of time, merely titular and sometimes hereditary.
In most cases, as the name of the office would suggest, they were
held by those who discharged personal functions about the
sovereign. Gradually, in ways or for reasons which might vary
in each individual case, the office alone survived, the duties either
ceasing to be necessary, or being transferred to officers of less
exalted station and permanently attached to the sovereign&rsquo;s
household. For example, in Prussia, there are certain great
titular officers, such as the Oberstmarschall (great chamberlain);
the Oberstjägermeister (grand master of the hunt); the Oberstschenk
(grand cup-bearer) and the Obersttruchsess (grand
carver), while, at the same time, there are also departments which
correspond, to a great extent&mdash;both as to offices and their
duties&mdash;to those of the household of the English sovereigns.
This is a feature which must necessarily be reproduced in any
monarchical country, whatever the date of its foundation,
to a more or less limited extent, and varying in its constitution
with the needs or customs of the particular countries.

1 The great officers of state and the household whom we have
particularly mentioned do not of course exhaust the catalogue of
them. We have named those only whose representatives are still
dignitaries of the court and functionaries of the palace. If the
reader consults Hallam (Middle Ages, i. 181 seq.), Freeman (Norman
Conquest, i. 91 seq., and v. 426 seq.) and Stubbs (Const. Hist. i. 343,
seq.), he will be able himself to fill in the details of the outline we
have given above.

2 The record in question is entitled Constitutio Domus Regis de
Procurationibus, and is printed by Hearne (Liber Niger Scaccarii,
i. 341 sq.). It is analysed by Stubbs (Const. Hist. vol. i. note 2,
p. 345).

and partly after this volume; and Carlisle&rsquo;s Gentlemen of the Privy
Chamber, published in 1829. Pegge and Carlisle, however, deal with
small and insignificant portions of the royal establishment.

4 Liber niger domus Regis Edward IV. and Ordinances for the
Household made at Eltham in the seventeenth year of King Henry
VIII., A.D. 1526, are the titles of these two documents. The earlier
documents printed in the same collection are Household of King
Edward III. in Peace and War from the eighteenth to the twenty-first
year of his reign; Ordinances of the Household of King Henry IV.
in the thirty-third year of his reign, A.D. 1455, and Articles ordained
by King Henry VII. for the Regulation of his Household, A.D. 1494.

5 The Book of the Household of Queen Elizabeth as it was ordained
in the forty-third year of her Reign delivered to our Sovereign Lord
King James, &amp;c., is simply a list of officers&rsquo; names and allowances.
It seems to have been drawn up under the curious circumstances
referred to in Archaeologia (xii. 80-85). For the rest of these
documents see Ordinances and Regulations, &amp;c., pp. 299, 340, 347,
352, 368 and 380.

the debt contracted upon the civil list, and for preventing the same

passed in 1782. But it was foreshadowed in his great speech on
&ldquo;Economical Reform&rdquo; delivered two years before. Since the
beginning of the 19th century select committees of the House of
Commons have reported on the civil list and royal household in
1803, 1804, 1815, 1831 and 1901.

HOUSEL, the English name, until the time of the Reformation,
for the Eucharist. The word in O. Eng. was húsel. Its proper
meaning is &ldquo;sacrifice,&rdquo; and thus the word hunsl appears in
Ulfilas&rsquo; Gothic version of Matt. ix. 13, &ldquo;I will have mercy and
not sacrifice.&rdquo; The ultimate origin is doubtful. The New
English Dictionary connects it with a Teutonic stem meaning
&ldquo;holy&rdquo;; from which is derived the Lithuanian szwe&#324;tas, and
Lettish swéts. Skeat refers it to a root meaning &ldquo;to kill,&rdquo;
which may connect it with Gr. &#954;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957;.



HOUSELEEK, Sempervivum, a genus of ornamental evergreen
plants belonging to the natural order Crassulaceae. About
30 species are known in gardens, some of which are hardy
perennial herbs, and grow well in dry or rocky situations; the
others are evergreen shrubs or undershrubs, fit only for cultivation
in the greenhouse or conservatory. The genus Sempervivum
is distinguished from the nearly allied Sedum by having more
than five (about 12) petals, and by the glands at the base of the
ovary being laciniated if present. The common houseleek,
S. tectorum (Ger. Hauswurzel, Fr. joubarbe), is often met with in
Britain on roofs of outhouses and wall-tops, but is not a native.
Originally it was indigenous in the Alps, but it is now widely
dispersed in Europe, and has been introduced into America.
The leaves are thick, fleshy and succulent, and are arranged
in the form of a rosette lying close to the soil. The plant propagates
itself by offsets on all sides, so that it forms after a time
a dense cushion or aggregation of rosettes. The flowering stem,
which is of rather rare occurrence, is about 1 ft. high, reddish,
cylindrical and succulent, and ends in a level-topped cyme, reflexed
at the circumference, of reddish flowers, which bloom
from June to September. The houseleek has been known
variously as the houselick, homewort or great houseleek. Sedum
acre (stone-crop) is styled the little houseleek. In Germany it is
sometimes called Donnerkraut, from being supposed to protect
the house on which it grows from thunder. The leaves are said to
contain malic acid in considerable quantity, and have been eaten
as salad, like Portulaca. S. glutinosum and S. balsamiferum,
natives respectively of Madeira and the Canary Islands, contain
a very viscous substance in large quantity, and are used for the
preparation of bird-lime; fishermen in Madeira, after dipping
their nets in an alkaline solution, rub them with this substance,
rendering them as tough as leather. S. montanum, indigenous
in Central Europe, according to Gmelin, causes violent purging;
S. arboreum, &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#7952;&#947;&#945; &#7936;&#949;&#943;&#950;&#969;&#959;&#957; of Dioscorides, is employed in
Cyprus, the East, and northern Africa as an external remedy for
malignant ulcers, inflammations and burns, and internally for
mucous discharges.



HOUSING. The housing of the poorer classes has become
a pressing problem in all populous Western countries, and has
engaged, in a varying but constantly increasing measure, the
attention of legislative and administrative bodies and of philanthropic
individuals and societies. The general interest was
815
signalized by an International Congress held in London in 1907.
The recognition of the problem is due in the first instance to the
science of public health, the rise of which dates from the second
quarter of the 19th century; and in the second instance to the
growth of urban populations consequent on the development
of manufacturing industries and of trading and transporting
agencies, both of which tend to mass increasing numbers of people
in convenient centres. To have a clear view of the subject it
is necessary to distinguish these factors and their respective
influence upon the problem. Urban congestion is quite secondary,
and only important because and so far as it has a prejudicial
effect upon health and strength. Further, the requirements on
the scientific side, made on behalf of public health, are of very
much wider application and more expansive than those which
arise from the mere growth of urban population. That is obvious
at once from the fact that they extend to rural housing, which
has indeed become a prominent feature of the question in
recent years. To ascribe the housing problem to the &ldquo;factory
system,&rdquo; as some writers have done, is to put forward an inadequate
and misleading view of it. It is, in fact, particularly
acute in some places totally devoid of factories and least acute
in some purely factory towns. If the factory system were
abolished with all its effects the housing question would remain.
But there is a more important distinction than extent of application.
The requirements of public health are indeterminate and
interminable; knowledge increases, or rather changes, and the
standard constantly rises. It is the changing standard which
gives most trouble; housing at one period thought good enough
is presently condemned. Fifty years ago no house existed
which would satisfy modern sanitary standards, and the mansions
of the great were in some respects inferior to the worst quarters
to-day. And to this process there is no end. It is quite conceivable
that urban congestion might cease to be a difficulty at
all. That actually happens in particular towns where the
population is stationary or diminishing. One whole nation
(France) has already reached that point, and others are moving
towards it at varying rates. But even where the supply of
houses exceeds the demand and many stand empty, the housing
problem remains; condemnation of existing accommodation
continues and the effort to provide superior houses goes on. In
other words, there are two main aspects of the housing question,
quality and quantity; they touch at various points and interact,
but they are essentially distinct. The problem of quantity may
be &ldquo;solved,&rdquo; that of quality has no finality.

The importance attached to housing is much enhanced by
the general tendency to lay stress on the material conditions
of life, which characterizes the present age. Among material
conditions environment takes a leading place, largely under the
influence of the theory of evolution in a popular and probably
erroneous form; and among the factors of environment the
home assumes a more and more prominent position. There is
reason in this, for whatever other provision be made for work
or recreation the home is after all the place where people spend
most of their time. Life begins there and generally ends there.
At the beginning of life the whole time is spent there and home
conditions are of paramount importance to the young, whose
physical welfare has become the object of increasing care. But
the usual tendency to run to extremes has asserted itself. It
may be admitted that it is extremely difficult to raise the
character and condition of those who live in thoroughly bad
home surroundings, and that an indispensable or preliminary
step is to improve the dwelling. But if in pursuit of this object
other considerations are lost sight of, the result is failure. Bad
housing is intimately connected with poverty; it is, indeed,
largely a question of poverty now that the difference between
good and bad housing is understood and the effects of the latter
are recognized. The poorest people live under the worst housing
conditions because they are the cheapest; the economic factor
governs the situation. Poverty again is associated with bad
habits, with dirt, waste, idleness and vice, both as cause and
as effect. These factors cannot be separated in real life; they
act and react upon each other in such a way that it is impossible
to disentangle their respective shares in producing physical
and moral evils. To lay all responsibility upon the structural
environment is an error constantly exposed by experience.

Defective quality embraces some or all of the following
conditions&mdash;darkness, bad air, damp, dirt and dilapidation.
Particular insanitary conditions independent of the structure
are often associated; namely defects of water-supply, drainage,
excrement and house refuse removal, back-yards and surrounding
ground; they contribute to dirt, damp and bad air. Defective
quantity produces high rents and overcrowding, both of
which have a prejudicial effect upon health; the one by diminishing
expenditure on other necessaries, the other by fouling the
atmosphere and promoting the spread of infectious illness.
The physical effects of these conditions have been demonstrated
by comparative statistics of mortality general and
special; among the latter particular stress is laid on the mortality
of infants, that from consumption and from &ldquo;zymotic&rdquo; diseases.
The statistical evidence has been especially directed to the
effects of overcrowding, which can be stated with greater precision
than other insanitary conditions. It generally takes the
form of comparing the death-rates of different areas having widely
contrasted densities of population or proportions of persons
to a given space. It is not necessary to quote any of these
figures, which have been produced in great abundance. They
broadly establish a connexion between density and mortality;
but the inference that the connexion can be reduced to a precise
numerical statement and that the difference of mortality shown
is all due to overcrowding or other housing conditions is highly
fallacious. Many other factors ought to be taken into account,
such as the age-distribution of the population, the birth-rate,
the occupations, means, character and habits of the people,
the geographical situation, the number of public institutions,
hospitals, workhouses, asylums and so forth. The fallacious
use of vital statistics for the purpose of proving some particular
point has become so common that it is necessary to enter a
warning against them; the subject of housing is a popular
field for the exercise of that art, though there is no need of it.

The actual state of housing in different countries and localities,
the efforts made to deal with it by various agencies, the subsidiary
points which arise in connexion with it and the results
attained&mdash;all these heads embrace such a vast mass of facts
that any attempt to treat them fully in detail would run to
inordinate length. It must suffice to review the more salient
points; and the most convenient way of doing so is to deal
first with Great Britain, which has led the way historically
in extent of need, in its recognition and in efforts to meet it,
adding some notes upon other countries, in which the question
is of more recent date and for which less information is available.

The United Kingdom

The importance of housing and the need of improvement
had by 1909 received public recognition in England for nearly
70 years, a period coinciding almost exactly with the systematic
study of sanitation or public health. The active movement
definitely began about 1841 with voluntary effort in which
Lord Shaftesbury was the most prominent and active figure.
The motive was philanthropic and the object was to improve
the condition of the working classes. It took the form of
societies; one was the &ldquo;Metropolitan Association for Improving
the Dwellings of the Industrial Classes,&rdquo; incorporated in 1845
but founded in 1841; another was the &ldquo;Society for Improving
the Condition of the Labouring Classes,&rdquo; originally the
&ldquo;Labourers&rsquo; Friend Society,&rdquo; of which the Prince Consort
became president. That fact and the statement of the Society
concerning improved housing that &ldquo;the moral were almost
equal to the physical benefits,&rdquo; sufficiently prove that public
interest in the subject and a grasp of its significance already
existed at that date. Legislation followed not long after and
has continued at intervals ever since.


Legislation.&mdash;Twenty-eight Housing and Health Acts, passed
between 1851 and 1903, are enumerated by Mr Dewsnup, whose
monograph on The Housing Problem in England is the fullest account
816
of the subject published. The first was the Shaftesbury Act of 1851
for the establishment of lodging-houses for the working classes;
the last was the Housing of the Working Classes Act of 1903. The
Shaftesbury Act had in view the provision by local authorities of
good lodging-houses for the better class of artisans, and particularly
of single persons, male and female, though families were also contemplated.
It was accompanied in the same year by another act,
not included in the list of twenty-eight, for the regulation and control
of common lodging-houses, from which Mr Dewsnup reasonably
infers that the object of Lord Shaftesbury, who inspired both acts,
was the separation of the casual and disorderly class frequenting
common lodging-houses from the more regularly employed and
respectable workers who were sometimes driven to use them for
lack of other accommodation. At any rate this early legislation
embodied the principle of differential treatment and showed a grasp
of the problem not always visible in later procedure. The most
important of the subsequent acts were those of 1855 and 1866, both
intended to encourage private enterprise in the provision of working-class
dwellings; the Torrens Act of 1868 (Artisans&rsquo; and Labourers&rsquo;
Dwellings Act) for the improvement or demolition of existing
buildings; the Cross Act of 1875 (Artisans&rsquo; and Labourers&rsquo; Dwellings
Improvement Act), for extending that process to larger areas; the
Public Health Act of 1875; the Housing of the Working Classes Act
of 1885 following the report of the Royal Commission on the Housing
of the Working Classes, of which King Edward, then prince of
Wales, was a member; the Housing of the Working Classes Act of
1890; the Public Health (London) Act of 1891. The acts of 1875
(Public Health), of 1890 and of 1891 are still in force. The story of
this half-century of legislation (which also includes a number of
Scotch and Irish acts, local private acts and others bearing on the
question) is one of tentative efforts first in one direction then in
another, of laws passed, amended, extended, consolidated, superseded.
Many of the enactments, originally of limited application,
were subsequently extended, and the principal laws now in force
apply to the whole of the United Kingdom. Two main objects can
be distinguished&mdash;(1) the treatment of existing dwellings by demolition
or improvement; (2) the construction of new ones. The
second head is further subdivided into (a) municipal action, (b)
private action. These objects have been alternately promoted by
legislative measures conceived and carried out on no systematic
plan, but gradually and continuously developed into an effective
body of law, particularly with regard to the means of dealing with
existing insanitary dwellings. The advancing requirements of
public health are clearly traceable in the series of enactments directed
to that end. The Nuisances Removal Act of 1855 took cognizance
of premises in such a state as to be &ldquo;a nuisance or injurious to
health,&rdquo; and made provision for obtaining an order to prohibit the
use of such premises for human habitation. In the same act overcrowding
obtained statutory recognition as a condition dangerous or
prejudicial to health, and provision was made for compelling its
abatement. The campaign against bad housing conditions thus
inaugurated by the legislature was extended by subsequent acts in
1860, 1866 and 1868, culminating in the Cross Act of 1875 for the
demolition (and reconstruction) of large insanitary areas and the
extremely important Public Health Act of the same year. The
constructive policy, begun still earlier in 1851 by Lord Shaftesbury&rsquo;s
Act, was concurrently pursued, and for some years more actively
than the destructive; but after 1866 the latter became more prominent,
and though the other was not lost sight of it fell into the
background until revived by the Royal Commission of 1885 and the
housing legislation which followed, particularly the Housing of the
Working Classes Act of 1890, amending and consolidating previous
acts.


The laws in operation at the beginning of 1909 were the
Public Health Acts of 1875 and 1891 (London), as amended by
subsequent minor measures, and the Housing of the Working
Classes Act of 1890, amended in 1894, 1900 and 1903. The
Public Health Acts place upon the local sanitary authority
the obligation of securing, under by-laws, the proper construction,
draining and cleaning of streets, removal of house refuse and
building of houses, including structural details for the prevention
of damp and decay, the provision of sanitary conveniences and
an adequate water-supply; also of inquiring into and removing
nuisances, which include any premises in such a condition as
to be a nuisance or injurious to health and any house so overcrowded
as to be dangerous or injurious to health. For the
purpose of carrying out these duties the local authority has the
power of inspection, of declaring a building unfit for human
habitation and of closing it by order. The Housing Acts give
more extended power to the local authority to demolish insanitary
dwellings and clear whole areas or &ldquo;slums,&rdquo; and also
to construct dwellings for the working classes with or without
such clearance; they also retain the older provisions for encouraging
private enterprise in the erection of superior dwellings for
the working classes. The procedure for dealing with insanitary
property under these Acts is too intricate to be stated in detail;
but, briefly, there are two ways of proceeding. In the first
the local authority, on receiving formal complaint of an unhealthy
area, cause an inspection to be made by their medical officer,
and if the report in their opinion justifies action, they may
prepare an &ldquo;improvement scheme,&rdquo; which is submitted to the
Local Government Board. The Board holds an inquiry, and, if
satisfied, issues a provisional order, which has to be confirmed
by a special act of parliament, under which the local authority
can proceed to demolish the houses concerned after paying
compensation to the owners. This procedure, which is authorized
by part i. of the act of 1890, is obviously both cumbrous and
costly. The second way, provided for by part ii. of the act,
is much simpler and less ambitious; it only applies to single
houses or groups of houses. The medical officer in the course
of his duty reports to the local authority any houses which are
in his opinion unfit for human habitation; the local authority
can then make an order to serve notices on the owners to repair
the houses at their own expense. Failing compliance on the
part of the owners, an order for closing the houses can be obtained;
and if nothing is done at the end of three months an order for
demolition can be made. Buildings injurious by reason of their
obstructive character (e.g. houses built back to back so as to
be without through ventilation and commonly called &ldquo;back-to-back&rdquo;
houses) can be dealt with in a similar manner. Small
areas containing groups of objectionable houses of either kind
may be made the subject of an improvement scheme, as above.
Where areas are dealt with under improvement schemes there
is a certain obligation to re-house the persons displaced. Building
schemes are provided for under part iii. of the act. Land may
be compulsorily purchased for the purpose and the money
required may be raised by loans under certain conditions. The
provisions thus summarized were considerably modified by the
&ldquo;Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c., Act,&rdquo; passed at the end of 1909.
It rendered obligatory the adoption (previously permissive)
of the housing provisions (part iii.) of the act of 1890 by local
authorities, simplified the procedure for the compulsory purchase
of land required for the purpose and extended the facilities for
obtaining loans. It further gave power to the Local Government
Board to compel local authorities to put in force the act of 1890
in regard both to existing insanitary housing and the provision
of new housing. Power was also given to county councils to
act in default of rural district councils in regard to new housing.
The procedure for dealing with insanitary houses by closing
and demolition under part ii. (see above) was rendered more
stringent. The general intention of the new act was partly
to facilitate the administration of the previous one by local
authorities and partly to provide means of compelling supine
authorities to take action. Its town-planning provisions are
noted below.

Effects of Legislation.&mdash;The efficacy of laws depends very largely
on their administration; and when they are permissive and
dependent on the energy and discretion of local bodies their
administration varies greatly in different localities. That has
been the case with the British housing and health laws, and is
one cause of dissatisfaction with them. But in the aggregate
they have effected very great improvement. Public action has
chiefly taken effect in sanitary reform, which includes the
removal of the worst housing, through demolition or alteration,
and general sanitary improvements of various kinds. In some
large towns the worst parts have been transformed, masses of
old, narrow, crowded, dilapidated and filthy streets and courts
have been swept away at one blow or by degrees; other parts
have been reconstructed or improved. The extent to which
this has been accomplished is not generally recognized. It
is not easily demonstrated, and to realize it local knowledge,
observation and memory are needed. The details of the story
are hidden away in local annals and official reports; and writers
on the subject are usually more concerned with what has not
than with what has been done. Both the Public Health and the
Housing Acts have had a share in the improvement effected.
817
The operation of the former is slow and gradual, but it is continuous
and far more general than that of the latter. It embraces
many details which are not usually taken into account in discussing
housing, but which have as much bearing on the healthiness
of the home as the structure itself. The Public Health Acts
have further had a certain preventive influence in laying down
a standard for the erection of new houses by the ordinary
commercial agencies. Such houses are not ideal, because the
commercial builder studies economy and the question of rent;
but the standard has risen, and building plans involving insufficient
light and air, such as once were general, have now
for several years been forbidden almost everywhere. Supervision
of commercial building is, in fact, vastly more important
than the erection of dwellings by public or philanthropic agencies,
because it affects a vastly larger proportion of the population.
The influence of the Public Health Acts in improving the conditions
of home life cannot be estimated or summarized, but it
is reflected in the general death-rate, which fell steadily in the
United Kingdom from 21.1 per 1000 in 1878 to 15.4 per 1000
in 1907.


Insanitary Areas.&mdash;The operation of the Housing Acts is
more susceptible of being stated in figures, though no fully comprehensive
information is available. The original Shaftesbury Act
of 1851 for erecting municipal lodging-houses appears to have been
practically inoperative and little or nothing was done for a good
many years. In 1864, however, Liverpool obtained a private act
and entered on the policy of improvement by the demolition of
insanitary dwellings on a considerable scale, following it up in 1869
by re-housing. In 1866 Glasgow, also under a private act, created
an Improvement Trust, administered by the city council, and embarked
on a large scheme of improvement. These seem to have
been the earliest examples. The Torrens Act of 1868, which embodied
the improvement policy, did not produce much effect. According
to a parliamentary return, during the years 1883-1888, proceedings
were only taken under this act in respect of about 2000 houses in
London and four provincial towns. More advantage was taken of
the Cross Act of 1875, which was intended to promote large improvement
schemes. Between 1875 and 1885 23 schemes involving
a total area of 51 acres and a population of about 30,000 were
undertaken, in London; and 11 schemes in provincial towns. By
far the most important of these, and the largest single scheme ever
undertaken, was one carried out in Birmingham. It affected an
area of 93 acres and involved a net cost of £550,000. Altogether
between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000 were raised for improvement
schemes under those acts. After the Housing Act of 1890 the
clearance policy was continued in London and extended in the
provinces. During the period 1891-1905 loans to the amount of
about £2,300,000 were raised for improvement schemes by 28
provincial towns in England and Wales. The largest of these were
Leeds (£923,000), Manchester (£285,000), Liverpool (£178,000),
Sheffield (£131,000), Brighton (£112,000). The Leeds scheme
affected an area of 75 acres, which was cleared at a cost of £500,000.
In London the area cleared was raised to a total of 104 acres; the
gross cost, down to March 31, 1908, was £3,417,337, the net cost
£2,434,096, and the number of persons displaced 48,525. Glasgow
has under its Improvement Trust cleared an area of 88 acres with
a population of 51,000. At the same time the policy of dealing
with houses unfit for habitation singly or in small groups by compelling
owners to improve them has been pursued by a certain
number of local authorities. In the six years 1899-1904 action
was taken each year on the average in respect of about 5000 houses
by some 400 local authorities large and small outside London.
Representations were made against 33,746 houses, 17,210 were
rendered fit for habitation, closing orders were obtained against
4220 and demolition orders against 748. These figures do not include
cases in which action was taken under local acts and Public
Health Acts. In Manchester, between 1885 and 1905, nearly 10,000
&ldquo;back-to-back&rdquo; houses were closed and about half of them reopened
after reconstruction. Hull, an old seaport town with a
great deal of extremely bad housing, has made very effective use of
the method of gradual improvement and has transformed its worst
areas without appearing in any list of improvement schemes. In
recent years this procedure has been systematically taken up in
Birmingham and other places, and has been strongly advocated by
Mr J. S. Nettlefold (Practical Housing) in preference to large improvement
schemes on account of the excessive expense involved
by the latter in buying up insanitary areas. In the six years 1902-1907
Birmingham dealt with 4111 houses represented as unfit for
habitation; 1780 were thoroughly repaired, 1005 were demolished;
the rest were under notice or in course of repair at the end of the
period. Among other towns which have adopted this policy are
Liverpool, Cardiff, York, Warrington and two London boroughs.

Building.&mdash;On the constructive side the operation of the Housing
Acts has been less extensive and much less general. In London
alone has the erection of working-class dwellings by municipal
action and organized private enterprise assumed large proportions.
Philanthropic societies were first in the field and date from a period
anterior to legislation, which however, stimulated their activity for
many years by affording facilities. Fourteen organizations were in
operation in London prior to 1890 and some of them on a large scale;
others have since been formed. The earliest was the Metropolitan
Association for Improving the Dwellings of the Industrial Classes,
whose operations date from 1847; it has built 1441 tenements
containing 5105 rooms. The largest of these enterprises are the
Improved Industrial Dwellings Company (1864), which has built
5421 tenements containing 19,945 rooms; the Peabody Fund
(1864) with 5469 tenements containing 12,328 rooms; the Artisans&rsquo;,
Labourers&rsquo; and General Dwellings Company (1867), with 1467
tenements containing 3495 rooms, and 6195 cottage dwellings;
the East-End Dwellings Company (1885) with 2096 tenements
containing 4276 rooms; the Guinness Trust (1889) with 2574
tenements containing 5338 rooms. The Artisans&rsquo; Dwellings Company
alone has housed upwards of 50,000 persons. In addition to
these there are the Rowton Houses (1892), which are hotels for
working men, six in number, accommodating 5162 persons. So
far as can be estimated, private enterprise has housed some 150,000
persons in improved dwellings in London on a commercial basis.
The early activity of the building companies was largely due to the
policy of the Metropolitan Board of Works, which adopted extensive
improvement schemes and sold the cleared sites to the companies,
who carried out the re-housing obligations imposed by the law.
Since the London County Council, which replaced the Board of
Works in 1889, adopted the policy of undertaking its own re-housing,
their activity has greatly diminished. The buildings erected by them
are nearly all in the form of blocks of tenements; the Artisans&rsquo;
Dwellings Company, which has built small houses and shops in
outlying parts of London, is an exception. The tenement blocks are
scattered about London in many quarters. For instance the Peabody
Fund has 18 sets of dwellings in different situations, the
Metropolitan Association has 14; the Artisans&rsquo; Dwellings Company
has 10; the Guinness Trust has 8. In 1909 an important addition
to the list of philanthropic enterprises in London was put in hand
under the will of Mr W. R. Sutton, who left nearly £2,000,000 for
the purpose of providing improved working-class dwellings. The
erection of tenement blocks containing accommodation for 300
families was begun on a site in the City Road. In only a few provincial
towns has private enterprise contributed to improved housing
in a similar manner and that not upon a large scale; among them are
Newcastle, Leeds, Hull, Salford and Dublin.

Municipal Building has been more generally adopted. The
following details are taken from Mr W. Thompson&rsquo;s Housing up to
Date, which gives comprehensive information down to the end of
1906. The number of local authorities which had then availed
themselves of part iii. of the Housing Act of 1890, which provides
for the erection of working-class dwellings, was 142. They were
the London County Council, 12 Metropolitan Boroughs, 69 County
Boroughs and Town Councils, 49 Urban District Councils and 12
Rural District Councils. The dwellings erected are classified as
lodging-houses, block dwellings, tenement houses, cottage flats and
cottages. Lodging-houses have been built by 12 towns, of which
8 are in England, 3 in Scotland (Glasgow, Aberdeen and Leith) and
1 in Ireland (Belfast). The total number of beds provided was
6218, of which Glasgow accounts for 2414, London for 1846, Manchester
and Salford together for 648. Four other towns have built
or are building municipal lodging-houses for which no details are
available. The other municipal dwellings erected are summarized
as follows:&mdash;


Kind of Dwelling. No. of Dwellings. No. of Rooms.

Blocks 12,165 27,523
Tenement Houses 2,507 6,068
Cottage flats 2,004 5,747
Cottages 3,830 17,611

&emsp; Total 20,506 56,949


It appears from these figures that municipal building has provided
for a smaller number of persons in the whole of the United Kingdom
than private enterprise in London alone. The principal towns
which have erected dwellings in blocks are London (7786), Glasgow
(2300), Edinburgh (596), Liverpool (501), Dublin (460) and Manchester
(420). The great majority of such dwellings contain either
two or three rooms. Tenement houses have been built in Liverpool
(1424), Manchester (308), Sheffield (192), Aberdeen (128), and in
seven other towns on a small scale. Such tenements are generally
somewhat larger than those built in blocks; the proportion of three- and
four-roomed dwellings is higher and only a small number consist
of a single room. Cottage flats have been built in Dublin (528),
West Ham (401), Battersea (320), Plymouth (238), East Ham (212),
and on a small scale in Liverpool, Birmingham, Newcastle and seven
other places. The majority of the cottage flats contain three or
more rooms, a considerable proportion have four rooms. Cottages
818
have been built in 67 places, chiefly small towns and suburban
districts. Of the large towns which have adopted this class of
dwellings Salford stands first with 633 cottages; three London
boroughs, all on the south side of the Thames, have built 234;
Manchester has 228, Sheffield 173, Huddersfield 157, Birmingham
103. The number of rooms in municipal cottages ranges from
three to eight, but the great majority of these dwellings have four
or five rooms.

Some further details of municipal housing in particular towns are
of interest. In London, the work of the London County Council
down to March 31, 1908, not including three lodging-homes containing
1845 cubicles, is given in the official volume of London Statistics,
published by the Council, as follows:&mdash;

Buildings Erected and in Course of Erection.


No. ofDwellings. No. ofRooms. Cost of Landand Building. No. of Personsin Occupation.

8,373 22,939 £2,438,263 26,687


With regard to the cost, it is to be noted that the actual cost of the
land purchased for improvement schemes was very much greater
than that stated, having been written down to an arbitrary figure
called &ldquo;housing valuation.&rdquo; The financial accounts of L.C.C.
dwellings for the year ending March 31, 1908, are thus summarized:&mdash;

London County Council Dwellings, Accounts 1907-1908.


GrossRental. Deductions forEmpties, &amp;c. Net Receipts. ExpenditureincludingInterest. NetReturns.

£180,169 £19,455 £160,714 £157,141 £3,573


It appears from this that if the actual commercial cost of the land
were taken the housing of the Council would be run at a considerable
annual loss. The occupations of the tenants are stated in the
following proportions: labourers 789, clerks 312, policemen 251,
shop assistants 202, warehousemen 183, printers 182, charwomen
182, tailors 155, cabinetmakers 146, canvassers 122, cigarette
makers 118, widows 116, tram drivers 110, postmen 107, packers 97,
engineers 87, dressmakers 41, coachmen 31, motormen 26, milliners
19. These proportional figures show that though a considerable
number of labourers have been housed, the great majority of the
occupants of London municipal dwellings are of a superior class.
The mean weekly rent in London County Council dwellings is
2s. 10½d. per room against 2s. 4d. in dwellings erected by other
agencies. The most important feature of the County Council&rsquo;s
policy in recent years has been the acquisition of suburban sites for
the erection of cottages. There are four such sites, two on the
south, one on the north and one on the west side of London; the
total area is 349 acres, and the total accommodation contemplated
is for 66,000 persons at an estimated cost of £3,105,840; the present
accommodation is for about 8000. In addition to the housing
provided by the County Council, fourteen London Borough Councils
and the City Corporation had at the beginning of 1909 erected or
adapted 3136 dwellings containing 7999 rooms.

In Liverpool, down to 1907, about £920,000 had been spent in
clearing insanitary areas and building new dwellings; the demolition
of about 8000 houses and purchase of land cost about
£500,000; and the erection of 2046 dwellings, containing 4961
rooms, cost about £350,000. The size of the dwellings and the
number of each class are: 1 room, 193; 2 rooms, 965; 3 rooms,
719; 4 rooms, 167. The great majority are in tenement houses of
three storeys. The mean weekly rent is 1s. 6½d. per room, but a
large number are let at less. The net return on the total outlay is
just over 1%, on the building outlay it is 22&frasl;3%. The principal
classes of persons occupying the dwellings are labourers 675, carters
120, charwomen 103, firemen 93, porters 80, hawkers 64, sailors 45,
scavengers 40. These all belong to the poorest classes, living by
casual or irregular work. Liverpool has, in fact, succeeded more
than any other town in providing municipal dwellings in which the
really poor can afford to live.

In Manchester 956 dwellings have been built at a total cost for
building and improvement of £451,932; of the whole number 420
are in blocks, 308 in tenement houses and 228 in cottages. The
rents are much higher than in Liverpool; in the tenement houses
the mean weekly rent is about 6d. per room more than in Liverpool.
The gross profit on the block dwellings is 11&frasl;3% on the capital outlay,
on the tenement houses 3%, on the cottages 22&frasl;3%. &ldquo;The total
loss during the last seven to ten years, including loan charges, has
amounted to about £54,240&rdquo; (Thompson).

In Glasgow the corporation has built under improvement schemes
2280 new dwellings containing 4013 rooms and 241 shops. The
dwellings, which are all in blocks and centrally situated, are occupied
chiefly by artisans; only 28% have been reserved for the poorest
class of tenants. The total amount taken from the rates on this
account in 30 years is £600,000. Dwellings valued at £400,000 for
building and £300,000 for land give a net return of 3.06% on outlay;
dwellings valued at £280,000 for land and building return
3.03% on outlay; leaving the sinking fund charges to be defrayed
out of rates.

In Edinburgh insanitary areas have been bought for £107,023
and new dwellings containing 1032 rooms have been built for £87,970.
Nearly all the dwellings are of one or two rooms only. The rents
charged average about 2s. a week per room; actual rents received
average 1s. 4d. per room and they have to be subsidized out of the
rates to the extent of 2s. 3d. per room to meet the cost of site.

In Dublin provision has been or was in 1909 shortly to be made
for housing 5394 families or 19,000 persons; of which 1041 families,
or about one-fifth, are housed by the Corporation, the rest by
companies and private persons. Altogether it was estimated that
£500,000 would be spent under the act of 1890. Fifteen streets,
containing 1665 houses, have been declared unhealthy areas by the
medical officer, and between 1879 and 1909 more than 3000 houses
were closed as unfit for habitation.

Co-operative Building.&mdash;Municipal and philanthropic housing by no
means exhaust the efforts that have been made to provide working-class
dwellings outside the ordinary building market. Their special
function has been to substitute better dwellings for pre-existing
bad ones, which is the most costly and difficult, as well as the most
urgent, part of the problem in old towns. But in the provision of
new dwellings alone they have been far surpassed by organized self-help
in different forms. Down to 1906 there had been built 46,707
houses by 413 co-operative societies at a cost of nearly £10,000,000.
They are most numerous in the manufacturing towns and particularly
in the north-western district of England. Of the whole
number 8530 were owned by the societies which built them; 5577
had been sold to members, and 32,600 had been built by members
on money lent by the societies. These figures do not include the
particular form of co-operative building known as co-partnership
housing, which will be mentioned later on, or the operations of the
so-called building societies, which are really companies lending
money to persons on mortgage for the purpose of building. The
difference between them and the co-operative societies which do
the same thing is that the latter retain the element of co-operation
by lending only to their own members, whereas the building societies
deal in the open market. Their operations are on an immense
scale; at the end of 1908 the invested funds of the registered building
societies exceeded £72,000,000. An agency working on this
scale, which far exceeds the operations of all the others put together,
is obviously an important factor in housing. The number of houses
built must help to relieve congestion, and since they are built to
suit the owners or tenants they cannot be of the worst class. They
also represent a form of thrift, and deserve notice on that account.

The Small Dwellings Acquisition Act of 1899, which has not
previously been mentioned, was intended to facilitate the building
or purchase of small houses by their tenants by means of loans
advanced by local authorities. Down to 1906 about £82,000 had
been so advanced by 5 county boroughs, 17 urban councils and 1
rural district council.

Housing by Employers.&mdash;No comprehensive information is available
on this head, but it has not been an important factor in towns,
being chiefly confined to agricultural, mining and suburban manufacturing
districts. The former two belong to the subject of Rural
Housing, which is separately discussed below; the third has an
interest of its own on account of its connexion with &ldquo;model settlements.&rdquo;
The building of houses for their workpeople by industrial
employers has never been widely adopted in this country, but it
has attracted considerable attention at two different periods. Sir
Titus Salt was a pioneer in this direction, when he built his woollen
mills at Saltaire, on the outskirts of Bradford, and housed his workpeople
on the spot. That plan was maintained by his successors,
who still own some 900 excellent and cheap cottages, and was
adopted by a few other manufacturers in the same neighbourhood.
Saltaire was a model settlement with many institutions for the
benefit of the mill-hands, and as such it attracted much attention;
but the example was not generally followed, and the interest lapsed.
Recently it has been revived by the model settlements at Port
Sunlight, near Liverpool, started about 1888, Bournville near
Birmingham (1895), and Earswick, near York (1904), which are of a
much more elaborate character. Elsewhere, employers setting down
works in some new locality where no provision existed, have had to
build houses for their workmen; but they have done so in a plain
way, and this sort of housing has not assumed large proportions.


Conditions in 1909.&mdash;It has been said above that great improvements
have been effected, and of that there is no doubt at all.
Both quantity and quality are more satisfactory than they were,
though both are still defective. The conditions vary greatly
in different places, and no general indictment can be sustained.
The common practice of citing some exceptionally bad cases,
and by tacit inference generalizing from them to the whole
country, is in nothing more misleading than in the matter of
housing. Local differences are due to several causes&mdash;age,
819
population, occupations and means of the people, public opinion
and municipal energy. The first three chiefly determine the
difficulty and extent of the problem, the last two influence its
treatment. The difficulty is greatest in towns which are old,
have large populations and a high percentage of poor. Such
pre-eminently are the large seaports, where much casual labour
is employed. London, Liverpool, Glasgow, the Tyne, Hull,
Sunderland are examples. Old inland towns having a large
trading as well as an industrial element present the same features.
Such are Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield and Bradford.
In all these, and some others like them, the past has left a heavy
legacy of bad housing by malconstruction and dilapidation,
which has been increased by growth of population and overcrowding.
They have attacked it with varying degrees of
energy according to the prevalent local spirit and with varying
results.

Overcrowding.&mdash;The one condition which permits of precise
and comprehensive statement is overcrowding. A standard
has been officially adopted in England based on the number of
persons to a room in each dwelling; and the facts in relation
to this standard are embodied in the census returns. It is a
much better criterion than that of &ldquo;density&rdquo; or number of
persons per acre, which is very deceptive; for an apparently
low density may conceal much overcrowding within walls and
an apparently high one may be comparatively guiltless. The
room-density is the important thing in actual life. Some light
is also thrown on this question by the number of rooms contained
in each dwelling, and that is also given in the census. The
standard of overcrowding is more than two persons to a room.
In 1901 there were in England and Wales 2,667,506 persons
or 8.2% of the population living in a state of overcrowding
according to this definition. Their distribution is extremely
irregular and capricious. In rural districts the proportion was
only 5.8%, in urban districts 8.9%; but these summary
figures give no idea of the actual state of things in different
localities. In both rural districts and in towns the proportion
of overcrowding varies in different localities from less than 1%
to over 30% of the population. The towns are the most important
and we shall confine attention chiefly to them. A list
of 84 having a population of 50,000 and upwards, exclusive of
London, is given by Mr Dewsnup. The overcrowding ranges
from 34.54% in Gateshead and 32.42% in South Shields to
0.97% in Northampton and 0.62% in Bournemouth. Of the
whole number exactly one-half have less than 5%; 15 have less
than 2% and 22 have 10% or more. Neither size nor character
has much to do with the variation. Bournemouth, at the bottom
of the list with 0.62%, is a residential place and health resort
with a population of about 50,000; so is Tynemouth, which is
nearly at the top, with 30.71%. The two largest towns, Liverpool
and Manchester, are 26th and 32nd on the list, with only 7.94%
and 6.28% respectively, or considerably less than the average;
and on the other hand none of the first 17 towns with the highest
proportion of overcrowding are of the largest size. Again, with
regard to character, Leicester and Northampton, which are
almost at the bottom of the list, with 1.04% and 0.97% respectively,
are both purely industrial towns. The most striking facts
are that the six towns, which alone have more than 20% of
overcrowding, namely Gateshead (34.5), South Shields (32.4),
Tynemouth (30.7), Newcastle (30.4), Sunderland (30.10),
Plymouth (20.1) are all old seaports, that four of them at the
head of the list are on the Tyne and the fifth on the Wear.
This points strongly to special local conditions and it is borne out
by the facts with regard to rural districts. Northumberland and
Durham show a great excess of overcrowding over other counties;
and some of their rural districts even surpass any of the towns.
The highest of all is the district of Tynemouth, with 38.18% of
overcrowding. The explanation lies in a special combination
of large families and small houses prevalent in this area. All
the rural districts are seats of coal-mining, and miners are the
most prolific section of the population. They also live in small
houses of a traditional and antiquated character, often of one
storey only or built back to back. Many are built by colliery
proprietors. Large families and small houses also prevail in the
towns. Some of them contain coal-pits and the rest of their
industrial population is engaged chiefly in engineering and
shipbuilding works, occupations also usually associated with a
high birth-rate. The men live as near their work as possible
and the practice of living in flats or occupying part of a house
prevails extensively.

In London the number of persons living in overcrowded
conditions in 1901 was 726,096 or 16.0% of the population.
The proportion varied from 2.6% in Lewisham to 35.2% in
Finsbury, but in 23 out of the 29 boroughs into which the county
is divided it exceeded the urban mean for the whole country,
and in 9 boroughs having an aggregate population of 1,430,000
it was more than double the mean. Conditions in London are
evidently untypical of English towns.

In the light of the census figures it is clear that no large
proportion of the English industrial population is living under
conditions of serious overcrowding, outside the special districts
mentioned and that the expression &ldquo;house famine&rdquo; cannot be
properly applied to England or English towns in general. In the
House of Commons, on the 16th of August 1909, the president of
the Local Government Board, Mr John Burns, gave a list of the
number of unoccupied houses and tenements in each of the
London boroughs and in the eight largest provincial towns,
including Glasgow; the total was 104,107. By a further
analysis of the census returns Mr Dewsnup shows that a great
deal of the overcrowding is of a comparatively mild character
and that it is due to a relatively small excess of population.
Bradford, for instance, is credited with 40,896 overcrowded
persons, representing the high percentage of 14.61 of the
population; but in the case of nearly 20,000 the excess over the
standard is very slight, and the proportion of gross overcrowding
comes down to 7.55%. Moreover, this serious overcrowding
is produced by no more than 2.79 of the population, so that
its cure presents no insuperable difficulty. The argument
is confirmed by the very substantial diminution which actually
took place between 1891 and 1901. The facts are so striking
that they deserve to be presented in tabular form:&mdash;

To what is this remarkable movement due? It is far too
general to be attributed to the operation of the Housing Acts;
for, though they have helped in some cases, a great diminution
has occurred in many places in which no use has been made of
them. Towns of all kinds and in all parts of the country exhibit
the same movement in some degree; those which had little
and those which had much overcrowding, the worst and the
best. In London the percentage fell by 3.7, and the number
of persons overcrowded was reduced by 103,669 in spite of an
increase of population of 324,798. In Gateshead a fall of 6.2%,
in Newcastle one of 4.6% took place; while at the other end
of the scale Leicester and Derby reduced their already very
low proportions by more than one-half. Nottingham is the
only exception in the whole list. And in 28 out of the 35 towns
the decrease of overcrowding was absolute as well as relative
in spite of a large increase of population. London has been
cited. The other large towns may be tabulated with it, thus:&mdash;


Town. Increase ofPopulation. Decrease ofOvercrowdedPersons.

London 324,898 103,669
Liverpool 166,978 2,381
Manchester 38,504 7,545
Birmingham 44,091 14,290
Leeds 61,463 17,252
Sheffield 56,550 1,388
Bristol 107,367 6,105
Bradford 63,406 3,696


The very divergencies make the uniform diminution of overcrowding
the more remarkable. The large increase of population
in Liverpool and Bristol no doubt means extension of boundaries,
which might have the effect of reducing the proportions of overcrowding,
but it cannot account for the actual decrease of
overcrowded persons. The change seems to be due to three
factors all of which have been in general operation though in
varying degrees. They are (1) the centrifugal movement promoted
by improved locomotive facilities, (2) the declining
birth-rate, (3) public health administration. (1) The first is the
most important and the chief element has been tramways, of
which a great extension accompanied by electrification took
place in the decade. Thus the process of urbanization has been
modified by one of suburbanization. Bristol is a prominent
case; its overcrowding has been reduced by more than one-half
without any large and costly municipal interference, mainly
through the operation of ordinary economic forces. Tramways
have made the outskirts accessible and builders have
utilized the opportunity. They have built good
houses, too, under supervision, and Bristol, though
an old seaport and industrial town with much
poverty, has the lowest general death-rate and
the lowest infantile death-rate of all the great
towns. (2) The birth-rate and the size of families
are conditions which affect overcrowding in a
very marked degree, though no attention is paid
to them in that connexion. The case of the
mining districts and the towns on the Tyne has
been mentioned above; the same thing is seen
in London, where all the most overcrowded districts
(Finsbury, Stepney, Shoreditch and Bethnal
Green) have high birth-rates, ranging from 31.3 to 36.4 per
1000 in 1902-1906. The necessity imposed on poor parents
of putting several children into a cheap and therefore small
dwelling accounts for a large proportion of overcrowding, which
automatically diminishes with a falling birth-rate. The ultimate
advantage of this method of reducing overcrowding is a question
on which opinions may differ, but there is no doubt about the
fact. (3) Public health administration is the third general
cause; it attracts no notice and works very gradually, but it
does work. The last annual report (for 1907) of the medical
officer to the London County Council says of overcrowding:
&ldquo;There is reason for thinking that in recent years greater
attention has been paid by sanitary authorities to the abatement
of the nuisance, and Dr Newman states that in Finsbury there
has been an enormous reduction in overcrowding, the reduction
having been effected mainly in the years 1901-1905.&rdquo; The
medical officers of the metropolitan boroughs reported in 1907
2613 dwellings overcrowded in 23 boroughs and 3216 such
dwellings remedied in 27 boroughs. It should not be forgotten
that a good deal of overcrowding is voluntary. Families which
have not enough room for their own members nevertheless take
in lodgers; and in some places, of which London is the most
conspicuous but not the only example, foreigners herd together
thickly in a very small space.

The improvement shown by the statistics of overcrowding is
confirmed by those relating to the size of dwellings. Between
1891 and 1901 the percentage of the population living in very
small dwellings appreciably diminished thus&mdash;in 1-roomed
dwellings, from 2.2 to 1.6%; in 2-roomed dwellings, from 8.3
to 6.6%; in 3-roomed dwellings, from 11.1 to 9.8%; while the
proportion living in dwellings of 5 rooms and upwards increased
from 54.9 to 60.1%. This again is referable to the suburban
movement and a higher standard of requirements. Six-roomed
houses with a bathroom tend to replace the old four-roomed type.
The general report accompanying the census says: &ldquo;However
the tenement figures for England and Wales are compared it is
impossible to avoid the conclusion that the comparison affords
satisfactory evidence of distinct improvement in the housing of
the people during the ten years 1891-1901.&rdquo; In short, the
problem of quantity is only acute in a few places and steadily
becoming less so.


The foregoing facts apply only to England and Wales. In Scotland
the state of things is much less satisfactory. No statistics of overcrowding
are available, but the following comparative table shows
how different the housing conditions are in the two countries:&mdash;

Size of Dwellings, England and Scotland, 1901.


Dwelling. Percentage of Population.
England. Scotland.

1 room 1.6 11.1
2 rooms 6.6 39.5
3 rooms 9.8 19.9
4 rooms 21.9 9.1
5 rooms and over 60.1 20.4


Over 50% of the population of Scotland live in tenements of one
or two rooms; only 8.2% in England. A comparison of the largest
towns in the two countries gives the following result:&mdash;

Percentage of Population.


Scotland. England.
Town. 1 Room. 2 Rooms. Town. 1 Room. 2 Rooms.

Glasgow 16.2 38.9 London 6.7 15.5
Edinburgh 8.9 32.4 Liverpool 2.7 5.9
Dundee 11.3 51.7 Manchester 0.8 4.01
Aberdeen 6.1 33.2 Birmingham 0.3 2.4
Greenock 11.3 47.6 Sheffield 0.4 4.0
Kilmarnock 18.9 43.3 Bristol 1.6 5.7

Mean 12.7 42.4 Mean 1.8 6.7


The conditions in Scottish towns where very tall tenement houses
are common, resemble those in other countries, in which overcrowding
is far greater than in England. All these matters are comparative,
and the superiority of conditions in England ought to be recognized.
Yet, in Scotland, too, great improvements have been effected. In
1861 there were 25,959 houses without windows; in 1901 only 130.
These facts throw light on the long standing of the housing question,
the change of standard and the improvement effected.

In Ireland there is more overcrowding than in England, though
probably less than in Scotland, with the possible exception of
Dublin, which has a larger proportion of one-roomed dwellings than
any Scottish town, namely, 24.7%. The percentage of population
living in overcrowded conditions in the principal towns is&mdash;Dublin
40.6, Limerick 31.7, Cork 23.4, Waterford 20.6, Londonderry 16.7,
Belfast 8.2.


821

Sanitary Conditions.&mdash;With regard to the quality of existing
housing reference has already been made to the effect of the
Public Health Acts and the general improvement in sanitation.
The only numerical measure is afforded by the death-rates,
which have fallen in England from 20.9 per 1000 in 1871-1875 to
15.4 per 1000 in 1903-1907 and in the United Kingdom from
21.3 to 15.7 per 1000 in the same period. The condition of the
dwelling must be credited with a considerable share in this fall.
There have, in fact, been great changes and all in the direction
of improvement. The rise and development of sanitation, of
house and main drainage and sewage disposal, the purification of
water and provision of a constant service in the house, the
removal of refuse, the segregation of infectious illness, sanitary
inspection&mdash;all these, apart from the demolition of the worst
housing and the provision of better, have raised the general
healthiness of the dwellings of the people. In face of these facts
and of the vital statistics, to say that the people are physically
deteriorating through the influence of bad housing is to talk
obvious nonsense, for all conditions have been improving for
more than a generation. If physical deterioration is going on,
of which there is no proof, either it is not caused by bad housing
or there is less than there was. Deterioration may be caused by
the continued process of urbanization and the congregating of an
ever larger proportion of the population in towns; but that is a
different question. If the town has any injurious influence it is
not due to the sanitary condition of the houses, which is in general
superior to that of houses in the country, but to the habits and
occupations of the people or to the atmosphere and the mere
aggregation. But much misapprehension prevails with regard to
towns. The most distinctive and the most valuable feature of
English housing is the general predominance of the small house or
cottage occupied by a single family. Only in London and a few
other towns do blocks of large tenement houses of the continental
type exist, and even there they are comparatively few. In
England and Wales 84% of the population live in dwellings of
4 rooms and upwards, which means broadly separate houses.
Now the prevalence of small houses involves spreading out and
the covering of much ground with many little streets, which
produce a monotonous effect; a smoky atmosphere makes them
grimy and dull skies contribute to the general dinginess. The
whole presents to the eye a vast area of dreary meanness and
monotony. Thus the best feature of English national housing
turns to its apparent disadvantage and the impression is gained
by superficial observers that the bulk of our working-class
populations lives in &ldquo;slums.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;slum&rdquo; has no precise
meaning, but if it implies serious sanitary defects it is not applicable
to most of our town housing. There are real slums still, but
the bulk of the working class population do not live in them; they
live in small houses, often of a mean and dingy exterior but in
essential respects more sanitary than the large and often handsome
blocks to be seen in foreign towns, which are not put down
as slums because they do not look dirty. A smoky atmosphere is
injurious to health, but it must be distinguished from defects of
housing. Ideal houses in a smoky place soon look bad; inferior
ones in a clean air look brighter and deceive the eye. The worst
of the old housing has disappeared; the filthy, dilapidated, airless
and sunless rookeries&mdash;the real slums&mdash;and the underground
dwellings have been swept away in most cases, and what remains
of them is not so bad as what has gone. But reform has been
very regularly applied. Some towns have done much, others
little. The large towns, in which the evil was most intense and
most conspicuous in bulk, have as a class done far more than
smaller ones in which the need perhaps was less great, but in
which also a less healthy public spirit prevailed. The worst
housing conditions to-day are probably to be found in old towns
of small and medium size, in which the ratepayers have a great
disinclination to spend money on anything, and the control of
local affairs is apt to be in the hands of the owners of the most
insanitary property. Nor is this state of things altogether confined
to old places. Some of recent growth have been allowed,
for the same reason, to spring up and develop without any regard
to sanitary principles or the requirements of public health.
There is therefore abundant scope for further reform and in not
a few cases urgent need of it. On the other hand, we have a
number of towns, particularly manufacturing towns, both large
and small in the midlands and the north of England, which have
already reached a good general standard of housing in all essential
requirements, and only need the regular and steady exercise of
vigilance by the public health service to remove such defects as
still remain or may reveal themselves with the lapse of time.


Rents.&mdash;Rent is a matter of great importance from every point
of view, and that is now being realized. A quantity of official
information on the subject has been collected and made available
by an elaborate inquiry ordered by the Board of Trade in 1905 and
published in 1908 (Cd. 3864). It relates to working class dwellings
in the principal industrial towns in the United Kingdom, 94 in all:
namely, 77 in England and Wales, 11 in Scotland and 6 in Ireland.
The following tables give in a condensed form the chief statistical
results obtained in October 1905:&mdash;

Predominant Range of Weekly Rents.

Rents are lowest in Ireland and next lowest in English provincial
towns, considerably higher in Scotland and highest of all in London,
for which further special details are given. It is divided into three
zones (1) central, (2) middle, (3) outer, which have the following
mean weekly rents:&mdash;

In central London&mdash;which extends to Stepney in the East, Lambeth
m the South, Islington in the North, and includes Westminster,
Holborn, Finsbury, Marylebone, Shoreditch, most of Bethnal Green,
Southwark and Bermondsey&mdash;the rent of a single room may be
as high as 6s. or even 6s. 6d. (Holborn) a week. It is here that
overcrowding is greatest, and block-tenements, philanthropic and
municipal, most numerous. The rentals of the block dwellings have
not been taken into account in the foregoing official statistics;
they range as follows: 1 room, 2s. 6d. to 5s.; 2 rooms, 5s. to 8s.;
three rooms, 6s. 6d. to 11s. The lowest rent for which a single
room can be obtained in this area is 2s. 6d. a week. In no English
town are rents nearly so high as in London. If 100 is taken as the
index number for rent in London the nearest towns to it (Croydon
and Plymouth) only reach 81, and one town on the list (Macclesfield)
is as low as 32. The index number of twenty-one towns out of the
whole is 50 or under, and these include a number of important
industrial centres&mdash;Hull, Leicester, Blackburn, Northampton,
Warrington, Coventry, Crewe and others. The index numbers of
the great towns are: Liverpool 65, Manchester and Salford 62,
Birmingham 59, Leeds 56, Sheffield 55, Bristol 53, Bradford 59,
Hull 48; that is to say the level of rents in these towns is little
more than half that in London. This is one more proof of the untypical
character of London, and of the fallacy of generalizing from
it to the rest of the country. Even in the overcrowded towns on
Tyneside rents do not run to three-fourths of the London level.
When the towns are divided into geographical groups the index
numbers run thus: London 100, Northern Counties 62, Yorkshire
56, Lancashire and Cheshire 54, Midlands 51, Eastern Counties 50,
Southern Counties 61, Wales and Monmouth 60. Rents are always
highest in capitals, and Edinburgh complies with the rule; but it is
very slightly in advance of Glasgow, and in Scotland generally the
range is much smaller than in England. Dublin, on the other hand,
is differentiated from the other Irish towns as widely as London
from English ones.

A general and progressive rise in rents has been taking place for
many years. The following index numbers for the great towns are
822
given in the second series of memoranda published by the Board of
Trade in 1904 (Cd. 1761):&mdash;

Relative Working-Class Rents.


1880 86.6 1890 89.9
1885 90.1 1900 100.0
1895 96.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;


The tendency to rise is attributable to increased cost of labour,
due to higher wages and less work, increased cost of materials and
higher rates. Weekly working-class rents generally include rates
which are paid by the landlord. Housing reform has contributed
to the rise, both directly and through the rates, on which it has
thrown a heavy burden in various ways. When slums are cleared
away and replaced by superior dwellings the new rents are generally
higher than the old and this fact has proved a great difficulty. Most
of the improved housing is beyond the means of those who need it
most, and they seek other quarters resembling the old ones as nearly
as possible. The example of Liverpool, which has the largest
proportion of casual and ill-paid labour of all the great towns, and
has been the most successful in providing new dwellings of a fair
quality, centrally situated and not in blocks, at really low rates,
shows that the problem is not insoluble; but as a rule too little
attention is paid to the question of rent in housing reform, especially
in building undertaken by municipalities. It is not ignored, but the
importance attached to it by the poor is not realized. To them it is
the first consideration after four walls, a roof and a fire-place;
and 6d. a week makes a vast difference in their calculations. Reform
which aims at raising the lowest classes of tenants by improving
their dwellings defeats itself when it drives them away.


Rural Housing.&mdash;Little has hitherto been said about rural
housing. It is of less importance than urban housing because
it concerns a much smaller proportion of the population, and
because in rural life the influence of inferior housing on health is
offset by other conditions; but it has recently attracted much
attention and was made the subject of inquiry by a Select Committee
of the House of Commons in 1906. The report laid stress
chiefly on the inaction of local rural authorities under the Public
Health and Housing Acts, and on various obstacles in the way
of improving existing houses and of providing more and better
ones at rents which agricultural labourers can afford to pay.
The available facts with regard to rural housing are scrappy and
unsatisfactory. The word &ldquo;rural&rdquo; has no precise meaning and
it includes several very different sections of the population; for
instance, the inhabitants of suburbs, mining villages and mill
villages as well as the real agricultural population. Complaint
is made of both the quantity and the quality of rural housing.
With regard to quantity it is said that in spite of migration to
the towns there is a dearth of cottages through dilapidation and
demolition without rebuilding. That may happen in particular
localities, but there is no evidence to support a general allegation.
Inquiries issued by the Board of Trade to agricultural correspondents
brought the following replies: insufficient 56, sufficient
111, more than sufficient 32. Similar inquiries of land agents and
owners resulted thus: insufficient 9, sufficient 11, more than
sufficient 4, variable 6. From which it appears that insufficiency
exists but is not general. The official evidence with regard to
overcrowding is that it is much less acute than in the towns.
The proportion of the rural population in England living in
overcrowded conditions in 1901 was 5.8%; if the rural mining
districts, the exceptional overcrowding of which has been noted
above, be eliminated, the rest cannot be very bad. Moreover,
the percentage has appreciably diminished; in 1891 it was
8.46. The complaint of bad quality is better founded. Some
landowners take great pride in the state of their property, and
excellent cottages may be found in model villages and elsewhere
in many parts of the country; but much rural housing is of an
extremely insanitary character. A good deal of evidence on this
head has of late years been published In the reports of medical
inspectors to the Local Government Board. And local authorities
are very reluctant to set the law in motion against insanitary
dwellings. On the other hand, they have in some cases hindered
and prevented building by too rigid insistence on by-laws,
framed with a view to urban housing and quite unsuited to rural
conditions. A few rural authorities have taken action with
regard to building schemes under Part III. of the Housing Act.
A list of 31 in 17 counties is given in &ldquo;Housing up to Date&rdquo;; 13
applications were refused and 13 granted by the respective county
councils and others were dropped. Details are given by the
same authority of 54 houses built by 17 rural district councils.
Public action may thus be said to amount to nothing at all.
Landowners, however, have borrowed under the Improvements
of Lands Acts upwards of £1,250,000 for building labourers&rsquo;
cottages; and this is probably only a fraction of the amount
spent privately.

In Ireland a special condition of affairs exists. A series
of about a dozen acts, dating from 1881 and culminating in the
Labourers (Ireland) Act of 1906, have been passed for promoting
the provision of labourers&rsquo; cottages; and under them 20,634
cottages had been built and some thousands more authorized
previous to the act of 1906, which extended the pre-existing
facilities. The principle is that of the English Housing Acts
applied to rural districts, but the procedure is simpler and
quicker. The law provides that a representation may be made
to the local authority by three ratepayers or resident labourers
that &ldquo;the existing house accommodation for agricultural
labourers and their families is deficient having regard to the
ordinary requirements of the district, or is unfit for human
habitation owing to dilapidation, want of air, light, ventilation
or other convenience or to any other sanitary defects,&rdquo; whereupon
the local authority shall make an improvement scheme. It may
also initiate a scheme without representation, or the Local
Government Board may do so in default of the local authority.
The scheme is published, an inquiry held, notice given and an
order made with very much less delay and expense than under
the English law. Land is purchased by agreement, or compulsorily
and the money for land and building raised by loan.
Loans amounting to about 3½ millions sterling had been raised
down to 1906. The great majority of the cottages built are in
Münster and Leinster. They must have at least 2 bedrooms
and a kitchen, and the habitable rooms must be 8 ft. high. One
of the most remarkable features is the low cost&mdash;about £150&mdash;at
which these cottages have been built, including land and the
expenses of procedure.

Recent Developments.&mdash;It is clear from a general review of
the subject that the problem of housing the working classes in
a satisfactory manner has proved more complex than was at
one time realized. Experience has falsified hopes and led to a
change of attitude. It is seen that there are limits to drastic
interference with the normal play of economic forces and to
municipal action on a large and ambitious scale. A reaction
has set in against it. At the same time the problem is being
attacked on other sides and from new points of departure.
The tendency now is towards the more effectual application of
gradual methods of improvement, the utilization of other means
and the exercise of prevention in preference to cure. Under
each of these heads certain movements may be noted.

The most troublesome problem is the treatment of existing
bad housing. In regard to this the policy of large improvement
schemes under which extensive areas are bought up and
demolished has had its day, and is not likely to be revived to any
considerable extent. That is not only because it is extremely
costly but also because it has in the main done its work. It
has done what could not have been done otherwise, and has swept
away the worst of the old housing en masse. To call it a failure
because it is costly and of limited application would be as great a
mistake as to regard it as a panacea. The procedure which seems
to be coming into favour in place of it is that adopted in Birmingham
and advocated by Mr J. S. Nettlefold (Practical Housing)
coupled with a more general and effective use of the Public
Health Acts. The principle is improvement in detail effected
by pressure brought to bear on owners by public authority.
The embodiment of this principle forms an important part of the
Housing and Town Planning Bill introduced by the Local
Government Board in 1908, which contained clauses empowering
the central authority to compel apathetic local authorities
to do their duty in regard to the closing of unfit houses, and
authorizing local authorities both to issue closing orders and
to serve notices on landlords requiring them &ldquo;to execute such
works as the local authority may specify as being necessary to
823
make the house in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation.&rdquo;

Among the other and less direct means to which attention
is being turned is the policy of getting people away from the
towns. The effect of improved travelling facilities in reducing
urban overcrowding has been noted above. That object was
not specifically contemplated in the building and electrification
of tramways, and in the development of other means of cheap
local travel, but the beneficial effect has caused them to be
recognized as an important factor in relation to housing and to
be more systematically applied in that connexion. A newer
departure, however, is to encourage migration not to the outskirts
of towns but altogether into the country by facilitating the
acquisition of small holdings of land. This has been done by
private landowners in an experimental way for some years, and
in 1907 the policy was embodied in the Small Holdings Act,
which gives county and borough councils power to purchase or
hire land compulsorily and let it in holdings of not more than
50 acres or £50 annual value. Failing action on their part the
Board of Agriculture may frame schemes. Power is also
conferred on the Board and on County Councils to establish
co-operative agricultural societies and credit banks. These
measures have been adopted from foreign countries, and particularly
from Denmark and Germany. A very large number of
applications for holdings have been made under this act, but it
is too early to state the effects. They will depend on the success
of tenants in earning a livelihood by agricultural produce.

Another new and quite different departure is the attempt
to establish a novel kind of town, called a &ldquo;Garden City,&rdquo;
which shall combine the advantages of the town and the country.
The principal points are the choice of a site, which must be
sufficiently convenient to enable industries to be carried on,
yet with rural surroundings, the laying out of the ground in
such a way as to ensure plenty of open space and variety, the
insistence on building of a certain standard and the limitation
of size. One has been established at Letchworth in Hertfordshire,
34 m. from London, and so far seems to be prospering. It consists
of an area of 3800 acres, bought from the previous owners by a
company registered in 1903 and entitled First Garden City Ltd.,
with a capital of £300,000 in £5 shares. The interest is limited
to a dividend of 5%, all further profits to be devoted to the
benefit of the town. The estate is divided into a central urban
area of 1200 and a surrounding agricultural belt of 2600 acres.
The town is planned for an eventual population of 30,000 and
at present (1909) has about 5000. Some London printing
works and other small industrial establishments have been
planted there, and a number of model cottages have been built.
In this connexion another recent novelty has appeared in the
shape of an exhibition of cottages. The idea, originated by
Mr St Loe Strachey, was to encourage the art of designing and
building cheap but good and convenient cottages, especially
for the country. Two exhibitions have been held at Letchworth
in 1905 and 1907, and others at Sheffield (1907) and Newcastle
(1908). The two latter were held on municipal land, and it is
proposed by the National Housing Reform Council to hold one
every year.

The &ldquo;Garden City&rdquo; has led to the &ldquo;Garden Suburb,&rdquo; an
adaptation of the same idea to suburban areas. One was
opened near Hampstead Heath in 1907: it consists of 240 acres,
of which 72 have been reserved for working-class cottages with
gardens. These developments, with which may be associated
the model industrial villages, mentioned above, at Bournville,
Port Sunlight and Earswick, represent an aspiration towards
a higher standard of housing for families belonging to the upper
ranks of the working classes; and the same movement is
demonstrated in a still more interesting fashion by a particular
form of co-operative activity known as Co-partnership Housing.
The first complete example of this method of organization was
the Ealing Tenants Limited, a society registered under the
Industrial and Provident Societies Act in 1901, though the
Tenant Co-operators Limited, formed in 1888, was a precursor
on very nearly the same lines. The essential principle is self-help
applied by combination to the provision of superior homes, and
the chief material feature is the building of houses which are
not only of good design and workmanship, but disposed on a
systematic plan so as to utilize the ground to the best advantage.
Land is bought and houses are built with combined capital to
which each tenant contributes a substantial share; the houses
are let at rents which will return 5% on share capital and 4%
on loan capital after defraying all expenses, and the surplus
profits are divided among the tenant members in proportion
to the rents paid by them. Each tenant&rsquo;s share of profits is
credited to him in shares until his share capital equals the value
of the house he occupies, after which it is paid in cash. There
is thus common ownership of the whole group, which forms a
little community. This system has caught on in a remarkable
way and has spread with great rapidity. In 1905 a central
organizing body was formed called the Co-partnership Housing
Council, for the purpose of promoting the formation of societies
and assisting them with advice; it is supported by voluntary
contributions. In 1909 twelve societies, including the original
Tenant Co-operators, had been formed with a total investment
of £536,300. They are situated at Ealing, Letchworth, Seven-oaks,
Leicester, Manchester, Hampstead (two), Harborne near
Birmingham, Fallings Park, Stoke-on-Trent, Wayford and
Derwentwater. The rapidity with which the movement has
developed and spread since the establishment of the Co-partnership
Housing Council indicates great vitality, and since it is
based on thoroughly sound lines it has probably a large future.
It is the most interesting and in many respects the best of all
recent developments. The Report of the Select Committee on
Rural Housing mentioned above suggested that a Co-partnership
Housing Society should be formed in every county in
England.

All the enterprises just described have one feature in common,
namely, the laying out of sites on a plan which takes cognizance
of the future, secures a due proportion of open space, variety in
the arrangement of streets and the most advantageous disposition
of the houses and other buildings. They go beyond sanitary
requirements and take account of higher needs. They have
lent force to the advocacy of municipal &ldquo;town-planning,&rdquo; as
practised by several towns in Germany; and provision was made
for this procedure in the Housing and Town Planning Act of
1909. The act contains clauses giving local authorities power
to prepare plans with reference to any land which appears
likely to be used for building purposes within or near their own
boundaries; and also to purchase land comprised in a town-planning
scheme and either build on it themselves or let plots
for building in accordance with the plan. The chief object is to
safeguard the future, prevent the repetition of past defects
and encourage a higher standard of housing.

These new developments represent an upward movement at
the higher end of the scale. They cater for the superior ranks
of working classes, those who attach some importance to
the aesthetic and moral influence of pleasant and wholesome
surroundings, and are willing to sacrifice immediate gratifications
to a higher end. They embody an aspiration, set an example and
exercise an educative influence. But they have nothing to do
with the housing of the really poor, which is the great difficulty;
and their very attractiveness seems in some danger of drawing
attention from it. Garden cities and suburbs will never house
the poor or even the bulk of our working class population, and
it would be a pity if the somewhat sentimental popularity of
romantic schemes led to a distaste for the plodding effort which
alone can effect a real cure of deep-seated social evils of long
standing. All the new schemes and legislative proposals leave
untouched the greatest difficulty of all, which lies not in the
dwelling but in the tenant. It is comparatively easy to afford
better opportunities to those who are willing to take advantage
of them, but how to raise those who are not? The lesson taught
by Miss Octavia Hill&rsquo;s classical experiment is, if not forgotten,
certainly neglected in the presence of more showy efforts. Or
perhaps it would be more true to say that half of it is neglected.
Miss Hill was one of the pioneers in the comparatively modest
824
method of improving and reconstructing bad houses, which, as
we have noted, is now being more generally recognized and
pursued; but that was only half her work. She improved bad
dwellings and made them decent, but she also managed them
on business lines, by a system of inspection and rent collection
which combined a judicious discipline with the stimulus of reward.
This was done by means of personal service, which is the secret
of all really effective work among the poor. Her words written
years ago remain true to-day: &ldquo;The people&rsquo;s homes are bad
partly because they are badly built and arranged; they are
tenfold worse because the tenants&rsquo; habits and lives are what
they are. Transplant them to-morrow to healthy and commodious
homes and they will pollute and destroy them.&rdquo;


The following is a list of the principal associations formed for the
promotion of housing reform: Mansion House Council on the Dwellings
of the Poor, Rural Housing and Sanitation Association, Workmen&rsquo;s
National Housing Council, National Housing Reform Council,
Co-partnership Tenants Housing Council. They are all of recent
date, except the first. There are also local associations at Liverpool,
Oldham, Rochdale, York, Plymouth, and elsewhere.


Other Countries

At the International Housing Congress organized by the
National Housing Reform Council and held in London in 1907
representatives were present from a number of foreign countries
and a good deal of information was collected and published in
the report of the Congress. Further detailed data have been
supplied by foreign correspondents to Mr W. Thompson and
published in Housing up to Date. The more important facts
relating to the principal industrial countries are here condensed
from this and other sources of information.


Austria.&mdash;An act for encouraging the building of cheap working-class
dwellings was passed in 1902; it provides for exemption from
taxes for 24 years of working-class dwellings which fulfil certain
conditions including sanitary requirements, a minimum area per
room, minimum height, minimum door and window spaces, thickness
of walls, a maximum number of inhabitants (one to 4 sq. metres in
sleeping rooms), prohibition of lodgers, fixed rent and maximum
profit. The municipalities are the authority for administering sanitary
and housing laws; they have no power of compulsory purchase of
land without a special law. There is excessive overcrowding in the
large towns; in Vienna (1900) 43% of the population live in dwellings
of 1 room or 1 room and a kitchen; in 60 provincial towns the proportion
is 63%. Overcrowding is reckoned at more than 5 persons
to a room and more than 9 to two rooms; the proportion of overcrowded
on this basis is nearly one-fifth in Vienna and one-fourth in
the provincial towns (Thompson).

Belgium.&mdash;An act was passed in 1889 instituting Comités de
Patronage; since then other Acts relating to loan societies, and to
inheritance and succession in the case of small properties. Comités
de Patronage are semi-official bodies, but without legal power, whose
function it is to study the subject of housing, to report to local
authorities on existing conditions, to advise, to collect funds and
promote the provision of good houses by any means in their power.
They influence public opinion and stimulate the activity of local
authorities which have the power to compel improvements and close
dwellings unfit for habitation; they have led to the formation of
numerous societies for erecting working-class dwellings. The latter
are encouraged by the law in various ways; they are exempt from
the payment of some government duties and partly exempt from
others. Working men buying or building houses liable to registration
fees up to from 72 to 171 francs are exempted from personal, provincial
and communal taxes. The National Savings Bank of Belgium
is empowered to lend money to working men for buying or building
houses and to insure the lives of those doing so, to preserve the
home for the family. In 1904 the number of workmen&rsquo;s homes
exempted from taxation was 164,387, and the amount of taxation
remitted considerably exceeded 3 million francs; workmen had
acquired lands and houses valued at nearly £4,000,000; there were
161 societies for building working-class dwellings; 30,000 workmen
representing a population of 150,000 had become owners of property;
and 70,000 representing a population of 350,000 had availed themselves
of the law in obtaining exemptions and loans (O. Velghe).
The foregoing results effected in 15 years are remarkable and indicate
a great capacity for self-help on the part of Belgian workmen with
suitable and well-considered assistance. But this movement, in
common with those of a similar character in other countries, does not
touch the problem of housing the very poor. No statistics of overcrowding
are available, but the average number of persons to a
dwelling is over 5 for the whole country and nearly 9 in Brussels.
The communal administrations are the authorities for health and
housing; they have power to abate nuisances but not to compel
landowners to sell land for building, though they have the right to
dispossession for &ldquo;public purposes.&rdquo; No town has constructed
quarters devoted entirely to working-class dwellings and only one
commune (St Giles) has built any. In towns the height of buildings
is regulated by the width of streets; generally it is the width plus
6 metres. The height of rooms and thickness of walls are prescribed
by local regulations but not the area of rooms. The housing difficulty
has been lessened in a notable degree by cheap transport facilities,
including railroads, light railroads and tramways; a large proportion
of the workpeople travel long distances to and from work. One-quarter
travel on the State railways alone; fares are 1s. 6d. a week
for a daily double journey of 20 m., 2s. for 44 m. and 2s. 6d. for
66 m. The area of the labour market of Liége extends nearly to
Ostend and out of 5830 workmen travelling over 1000 live more
than 50 kilometres from Liége. Some journeys last 3 hours.

France.&mdash;The question of housing was publicly raised in France
quite as early as in England on grounds of public health in connexion
with the first visitation of cholera, and building societies were
formed as early as 1851, but little was done until after 1889, when the
Société Française des Habitations à Bon Marché was founded under
the inspiration of M. Siegfried. This led to the formation of several
societies, which increased rapidly after the passage of la loi Siegfried
in 1894, for promoting the provision of working-class dwellings. In
1902 a Public Health Act and in 1906 a Housing of the Working
Classes Act were passed, and these three enactments with regulations
made in 1907 govern the procedure. The act of 1906 embodies the
Belgian system of Comités de Patronage, of which at least one was
to be established in each department with grants in aid, and exemptions
from certain taxes of working-class dwellings fulfilling
specified conditions as to sanitation and rent. The law promotes
the formation of Housing Societies by granting various facilities for
the investment of money in building by public bodies and benevolent
institutions by taking shares or by loans. Down to the end of 1906
there had been lent for this purpose £233,000 by savings banks,
£258,000 by the Caisse des Dépôts, and £14,000 by charitable institutions.
The law does not authorize municipalities to build
houses and none of the communes have acquired land for this purpose.
Under the Public Health Act of 1902 towns can purchase land
compulsorily in connexion with unhealthy areas. The Public Health
and Housing Acts are administered by the local authority, which
makes regulations for building and for laying out building land. A
minimum height of 2.6 metres and a minimum cubical content of
25 cubic metres are prescribed for rooms; there are no regulations
for thickness of walls. Housing societies are under the Ministry of
Works and a Superior Housing Council, which is a central advisory
body. These societies are now numerous; there are 46 in Paris
alone, but their operations are not on a large scale. One of them
deserves special notice on account of its special object. It is called
the Société de logements pour familles nombreuses and it builds special
flats called maisons des enfants which are let at low rents only to
persons with large families. In 1907 it had housed 168 families,
averaging 6.8 persons, in two blocks at Belleville and Montmartre.
The great defect in France is the large quantity of old, bad, insanitary
housing. Real slums exist in all the old towns and in some of them,
such as Marseilles and Lyons, on an extensive scale. Very little
has hitherto been done to grapple with this difficulty. The standard
of sanitation is altogether lower in France than in England, as is
shown by the death-rates, and this holds good of the housing. But
conditions vary widely in different parts of the country. They are
better, generally speaking, in the industrial towns of the north,
which are largely Flemish and distinguished by the prevalence of
small houses after the English fashion, than in the central or southern
districts where tall old tenement houses of six and seven storeys
abound. There are no statistics and no standard of overcrowding;
but the careful inquiry carried out by the Board of Trade and published
in 1909 shows the extraordinary prevalence of tenements consisting
of 1, 2 or 3 rooms. In 16 towns for which information was obtained
the average proportion of dwellings containing less than 4 rooms
was 75% of the whole; in some it was as high as 89% and in none
lower than 61%. In 8 towns, including Paris, the number of one-roomed
dwellings was more than a quarter of the whole, and in two
towns (Brest and Fougères) it was more than half. Some corresponding
statistics for English and German towns are given below in the
section on Germany. According to the same report, the general
accuracy of which has been confirmed by personal inquiries, made
in 1909 by the writer in a number of towns, rents are decidedly
lower in France. If the London level be taken as 100 that of Paris
is only 78 and the other French towns are considerably lower, 21 out
of 29 being less than half the London standard. A general comparison
between a number of English and French towns shows the
average level of French rents to be less than three-fourths of English
ones. A noticeable feature of housing in France is the large number
of dwellings built by employers in recent years. The mining companies,
particularly in the Pas de Calais, have built whole groups of
villages; the railway companies and various manufacturers have
also done a great deal, chiefly in rural areas. Among the manufacturers
MM. Schneider at Le Creusot and the textile mill-owners
in the Vosges are noticeable. The houses provided are
of a charming type, white with red roofs; the rooms are of good
size, the rents low, and a large garden is usually attached to every
house.

Germany.&mdash;In no country is the problem of housing more acute
825
than in Germany, where the increase of population, the growth of
manufacturing industry and the urbanization of the people have
proceeded at an exceptionally rapid pace in recent years and have
combined with increasing wealth and a rising standard of living to
force the question into prominence. Up to 1909 no uniform legislation
for the empire had been framed and no central authority
existed for dealing with housing; but the several states have their
own public health and housing laws, and great activity has been
developed in various directions. The most general difficulty is
deficiency of quantity consequent on the rapid change in the distribution
of the population. The proportion of the whole population
living in the great towns increased from 7.2% to 16.2%, or more
than doubled between 1890 and 1900; in England it only increased
by about one-tenth. Slums are a much less conspicuous feature
than in England because of the comparatively recent development
of German towns, but where old quarters exist on a large scale, as
in Hamburg, the conditions are quite as bad as anything in English
towns, and call for similar measures. Public sanitation in Germany
is still as a whole less advanced than in England; but in some
cases it is superior and in general it is coming up rapidly; the
administration of sanitary laws, as of others, is more effective and
uniform, and less subject to evasion. This also contributes to the
comparative absence of slums. And there is a third factor which
has perhaps the greatest influence of all, and that is the superior
manner in which German homes are kept. But the pressure of
inadequate quantity is urgent; it has caused high rents, overcrowding,
and the development of large barrack or block dwellings
which are becoming the prevailing type. At the same time it has
led to many and varied efforts to meet the difficulty. Isolated
attempts go back to an early date. For instance a building society
was formed in Berlin in 1849, Alfred Krupp began to build his
&ldquo;colonies&rdquo; at Essen in 1863, Barmen started a society in 1871 and
there were other cases; but general attention seems first to have
been drawn to the subject by the reforming efforts of Pastor Bodelschwingh
at Bielefeld about 1884 in connexion with his Arbeiterheim.
In short housing reform in Germany is really a matter of the last
20 years. The first efficient by-laws for regulating building in
Berlin were not adopted till 1887; the previous regulations dating
from 1853 permitted many abuses and under them a great deal of
bad housing was constructed, especially after the establishment
of the empire and the beginning of the great development of the
capital.

The worst feature is the general prevalence of dwellings containing
a very small number of rooms&mdash;from 1 to 3&mdash;and consequent
overcrowding. The following figures are extracted from the Report
to the Board of Trade on Rents, Housing, &amp;c., in Germany (1908,

1, 2 or 3 rooms, or (in a few cases) the proportion of the population
living in such dwellings. The towns are those for which the information
is given. They are not selected as particularly bad
specimens but as representative, and they include most of the
capitals and chief industrial centres. The figures relate to the year
1900, except in a few cases, in which they are taken from a municipal
house census in 1905.

The figures must be read with a certain amount of caution, as they
are not in every case compiled on a precisely uniform method with
regard to inclusion of kitchens and attics. For this reason the
position of Bremen and Elberfeld is probably more unfavourable
than it ought to be. But broadly the table shows that in most of
the large towns in Germany more than half, and in some cases more
than three-quarters of the dwellings have less than 4 rooms. Leipzig
is the most striking exception. If working-class quarters alone are
taken it is found that dwellings of more than 3 rooms are so few
as to be negligible. In Stuttgart, where housing is very dear, the
percentages for working-class quarters are&mdash;1 room 21.0, 2 rooms
51.8, 3 rooms 26.9; total under 4 rooms 98.7. Königshütte, the chief
coal and iron centre in Silesia and a purely working-class town,
shows the same state of things; 60% of the whole population live
in dwellings of 2 rooms and 87% in less than four. It is interesting
to compare English towns. The proportion of dwellings containing
less than 4 rooms in London was (1901) 52.2%, in Berlin 75.8%;
the proportion of the population living in such dwellings was&mdash;London
38.7%, Berlin 71.5%. Not only is the proportion of small
dwellings very much higher in Berlin but the proportion of the
population living in them shows a far greater discrepancy. This
indicates a much higher degree of overcrowding. The only point
in which Berlin has the advantage is the smaller number of single-room
dwellings. The proportions are London 14.7%, Berlin 8.0%.
But it is to be observed that overcrowding is not so common in
1-room dwellings, which are often occupied by a single person, as
in those with 2 or 3 rooms, which are occupied by families, though
probably the most extreme cases of overcrowding occur in particular
1-room dwellings. In the English county boroughs the proportion of
dwellings with less than 4 rooms was 24.0%, in other urban districts
17.4, and in all urban areas including London 26.4%. When all
allowance is made for minor errors and discrepancies it may be
broadly concluded that the proportion of small dwellings containing
less than 4 rooms is at least twice as great in German as in English
towns, and that the conditions as to accommodation which in
England prevail only in London are general in urban Germany.
As a set-off German rooms are generally larger than English ones
and in block dwellings there is often a little ante-room or landing
which does not count but really increases the space.

The German census does not take cognisance of overcrowding and
there is no general official standard; but some towns have adopted
a standard of their own, namely, six or more persons to 1 room and
ten or more to 2 rooms. In Breslau, which is one of the worst
towns, 17.5% of the population (53,000) of the &ldquo;city&rdquo; or inner
ring were overcrowded on this basis in 1900. In Barmen, which is
not one of the worst, 20% of the 2-roomed and 17% of the 3-roomed
dwellings (together housing more than half the population) were
overcrowded according to the English standard. Overcrowding
and other bad conditions are worst in the basement or cellar dwellings,
of which some towns have a very large number. In Breslau
15,000 persons were living in 3853 such dwellings in 1900; in
Berlin 91,426 persons were living in 24,088 basements. Some of
these are free from objection, but 11,147, housing 38,663 persons,
were situated in back buildings and unfit for habitation on account
of darkness, damp, dilapidation and the like. &ldquo;Back&rdquo; houses
are a feature of old towns; they are houses which do not give on
the street but lie behind and are approached by a passage; they are
what we call courts and quite as insanitary as anything of the kind
in English towns.

Comparing rents in Germany and England, the Board of Trade
Report gives the following table, to which the corresponding ratio
of French towns has been added.

If the mean of the English and German figures be taken it shows
a very slight difference in favour of Germany; the mean weekly rent
per room being 1s. 5d. in England and 1s. 4¾d. in Germany. But in
England rent usually includes local taxation (rates) whereas in
Germany it does not; if this be added German rents are to English
as 123 to 100, or nearly one-fourth more.

The statistics given above indicate a wide range of variation in
the conditions prevailing in different towns in Germany; and that
holds good with regard to improvements. The administration of
the laws relating to public health and housing is in the hands of the
local authorities. The public health service is generally efficient
and sometimes very good. Increasing attention has been paid in
recent years to the sanitary inspection of houses and in some towns
it is now thorough and systematic, but active efforts to deal with
old and insanitary quarters en masse are isolated and exceptional.
Hamburg is an instance; scared by the visitation of cholera in 1892
the authorities put in hand an extensive improvement scheme on
the English plan at a cost of half a million sterling. But demolition
is exceptional; slums are usually subjected to supervision and are
not allowed to be in a state of dilapidation, and sometimes, as at
Mannheim, notices are served to abate overcrowding. In Munich
a policy of gradually buying up insanitary houses has been adopted.
But improvement has principally been promoted by new building
and the reduction of the population in old insanitary quarters, to
which cheap locomotive facilities have greatly contributed. The
great bulk of urban Germany is new, and the most valuable contribution
made by it to the housing question is the more effective
control of new building and particularly the principle of town-planning,
coupled with the purchase of neighbouring ground with
a view to future extension. This policy is comparatively recent and
still very partially applied, but it is now rapidly extending. A
general act providing for the planning of streets was passed in
Prussia in 1875 and still forms the basis of building legislation;
but as noted above no effective by-laws were adopted even in Berlin
until after 1887, and consequently a very faulty style of building
was adopted, especially in large blocks which conceal grave defects
behind an imposing exterior. The Saxon towns have been conspicuously
successful in regard to housing. Leipzig stands alone
among German towns in having 83.4% of its population living in
dwellings of 4 rooms and upwards. Yet it is a great commercial
city, the fifth in the empire, with a population of upwards of half a
million. It also comes low on the rent table, having an index number
little more than half that of Berlin. All the Saxon towns are low,
Chemnitz and Zwickau particularly so, and the position of Dresden,
being a capital, is remarkable. More than two-thirds of the population
live in dwellings of 4 rooms or more, and the rent index number
is only 54. In Saxony a general Building Act, especially providing
for town planning, was passed in 1900; and the Grand Duchy of
Hesse, which alone among the German states has a government
Housing Department, adopted a Housing of the Working Classes
Act in 1902. Other states have followed or are following and the
air is full of movement. The distinctive features of urban housing
reform in Germany are (1) the systematic planning of extensions,
(2) purchase of ground by municipalities, (3) letting or sale of municipal
land for building under prescribed conditions. Many of the
great towns, including Berlin, Munich, Dresden, Leipzig, Cologne,
Frankfort and Düsseldorf, are owners of land to a variable but
sometimes large extent. This policy seems to have been originally
adopted on economic grounds and those municipalities which bought
or otherwise came into possession of town land at an early date
derive a substantial revenue from it now, besides being in a position
to promote housing improvement. There is comparatively little
municipal building, and that as a rule only or principally for municipal
servants, as at Düsseldorf, Mannheim and Nuremberg; but
there seems to be a tendency to venture further in this direction
and some towns have built houses for letting. The municipalities
generally sell or let their land, and the building agencies which enjoy
most official favour are the societies &ldquo;of public utility&rdquo;; they are
encouraged in every way and have greatly developed, particularly
in the Rhine province. Some are co-operative, others semi-philanthropic
in that they aim at building good houses and limit their
profits. In 1901 the Prussian Government issued an order urging
municipalities to support these societies by remitting the cost of
constructing streets and sewers, placing the assistance of building
officials at their disposal, taking their shares, lending them money
and becoming security for them. A great deal of public money
has been advanced to building societies, and one very important
source of supply has been developed, since the Old Age and Infirmity
Insurance Act of 1889, in the National Insurance Funds
which invest their surplus capital in this way. Down to 1906 the
Boards of insurance had lent £8,650,000 to societies for building;
the Imperial Government had lent £1,250,000, the
Prussian Government £1,825,000, and the other states
further large sums in addition to the municipalities.
Money lent by the state is usually limited to building
houses for state employees and Insurance Boards
lend on condition that the houses are let to persons
who come under the insurance laws. The development
of building societies has been promoted by the
formation of general building associations of which
the earliest was established in Düsseldorf in 1897 for the Rhine
provinces; under its influence one-fifth of the new housing provided
in 1901 was erected by the societies. The example was followed
at Frankfort, Münster and Wiesbaden. Housing by employers has
also been carried out on a large scale in Germany. States and
municipalities have to some extent built houses as employers, the
former chiefly for railwaymen, besides lending money to societies
for the purpose; but most housing of this kind has been done by
private employers. Krupps, who had built 4274 dwellings housing
nearly 27,000 persons down to 1901, are the most famous example;
but they are only one among many. In Rhineland and Westphalia
employers had in 1902 provided 22,269 houses containing 62,539
dwellings at a cost of £10,500,000; more than half the families so
housed belonged to the mining industry, the rest to various manufactures.
These two provinces, in which industrial development
has been extremely rapid, are exceptional; but housing by employers
is not confined to them. At Mannheim for instance over
1000 working-class households have been so provided. At Nuremberg
the Siemens Schuckert Company have encouraged an interesting
system of collective building among their employees, by which 722
dwellings have been provided.

Holland.&mdash;In 1901 a Public Health and a Housing Act were
passed, and these two embody most of the features of housing reform
adopted in other countries. The first provides for a general sanitary
service under the Ministry of the Interior. The second ordains that
local authorities shall frame by-laws for building and for the maintenance
and proper use of dwellings; that they shall inspect existing
dwellings, order improvements or repairs or demolition; empowers
them to take land compulsorily for the purposes of the act, to
prohibit building or rebuilding on sites reserved for public purposes
and to make grants or loans to societies or companies operating
exclusively for the improvement of working-class dwellings. If
they fail to make by-laws the provincial authorities may take
action. Land buying with a view to extensions has been adopted
by a number of municipalities including Amsterdam, Rotterdam,
Utrecht and other important towns, and the practice is increasing.
Amsterdam has also begun the systematic planning of extensions.
There has been a little municipal building in some small places, but
it is on an insignificant scale; the tendency is rather to favour societies
of public utility as in France, Germany and Belgium. The new laws
are too recent to have had much effect and housing reform is as yet
in an early stage. Rents are high in the large towns, namely, 1
room 1s. 8d. to 3s.; 2 rooms 2s. 6d. to 5s.; 3 rooms 3s. 6d. to 6s;
4 rooms 4s. 2d. to 7s.

Italy.&mdash;A Housing of the Working Classes Act was passed in
1903, to promote the improvement and provision of workmen&rsquo;s
dwellings. Municipalities have the power to purchase land compulsorily
for housing purposes and also to build workmen&rsquo;s dwellings.
A few towns, of which Milan is one, have done so. There are building
regulations relating to the area and height of rooms and the thickness
of walls. The antiquity of the Italian towns and the great quantity
of old and insanitary building make housing improvement a very
difficult matter. La Società Umanitaria, a benevolent trust founded
by Prosper Loria of Milan in 1902, has taken up this subject among
others and has built two model tenements, housing 2000 persons.

United States.&mdash;Interest in the housing question in the United
States is confined to a few of the largest cities and can only be said
to be acute in New York, though there have been investigations by
commissions elsewhere and Miss Octavia Hill&rsquo;s work in London
has found admirers and imitators in Philadelphia and Boston as well
as in New York. The evils of housing in New York have been the
subject of much sensational writing which has elevated them to the
position of a world-wide scandal. It is not necessary to accept all
the allegations made in order to see that several circumstances have
combined to produce an exceptional state of things in this great city.
The limited space&mdash;the island or peninsula of Manhattan&mdash;in which
central New York is built has compelled the erection of large tenement
blocks, otherwise rare in American towns; the incessant inrush
of immigrants from the poorest parts of Europe has filled these
tenements with immense numbers of persons of many nationalities
accustomed to a low standard of living; the generally backward
state of public sanitation in America, and the absence or evasion of
regulations and supervision, have permitted the erection of bad
dwellings, their deterioration into worse, and their misuse by excessive
overcrowding. Other large cities in which bad housing conditions
are known to exist are Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore,
Cincinnati, Pittsburg, Jersey City. There are doubtless many
others, but bad housing conditions are not so general in the United
States as in Europe. Outside the very large cities there is more
space, more light and air, less crowding together, less darkness, dirt
and dilapidation. Large houses, occupied by two or perhaps three
827
families, are common, but they have more room space than is usual
in Europe. The 18th annual report (1903) of the Commissioner
of Labour gives the result of a special inquiry embracing 23,447
families distributed in 33 states. The average number of rooms
was 4.95 per family and 1.04 per individual. It is a fair inference
that overcrowding is confined to a comparatively small number of
exceptional places. A large number of the schedules were furnished
by the eminently urbanized and manufacturing states of New
York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Ohio and Illinois; and in all
these the average number of rooms to a family exceeded 4, ranging
from 4.2 in Ohio to 5.5 in Massachusetts. The condition of homes
as to sanitation and cleanliness was statistically stated thus:
Sanitary condition&mdash;good 61.46%, fair 32,59%, bad 5.95%;
Cleanliness&mdash;good 79.63%, fair 14.66 bad 5.71%. Other
special inquiries have been carried out in particular towns. In
1891-1892 the tenements in Boston were investigated for the
Massachusetts Labour Bureau, which found 3657 sleeping rooms
without outside windows and about 8% of the population living in
conditions objectionable from one cause or another. In 1892
Congress authorized a special inquiry into the slum population of
New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Baltimore, the results of which
were published in the seventh special report (1894) of the United
States Commissioner of Labour. It was estimated that the total
&ldquo;slum population&rdquo; (presumably those living in unhealthy conditions)
was&mdash;New York 360,000, Chicago 162,000, Philadelphia
35,000, Baltimore 25,000. In Baltimore 530 families, consisting of
1648 persons, were living in single rooms with an average of 3.15
persons to a room; in Philadelphia 401 families were so living with
an average of 3.11 persons to a room. The proportion of 1-room
dwellings was less in New York and Chicago. In New York 44.55%
or nearly half the families investigated were found living in
2-roomed dwellings, in Baltimore 27.88%, in Philadelphia 19.41%
and in Chicago 19.14%. These figures conclusively prove that
European conditions reproduce themselves in American cities.
Poverty was not the cause, as the average earnings per family
ranged from £3, 4s. a week in Baltimore to £4, 6s. a week in Chicago.
Another official investigation in New York was carried out in 1895
by the Tenement House Commission appointed by the State of New
York. It reported &ldquo;many houses in the city in an insanitary condition
which absolutely unfits them for habitation.&rdquo; Further details
have been compiled from the census by the New York Federation
of Churches, chiefly relating to density of population in the city. In
1900, out of a total of nearly 250,000 dwellings, 95,433 (38.2%)
contained from 2 to 6 persons, 60,672 (24.2%) from 7 to 10 persons
and 89,654 (35.9%) 11 persons or more. The density of population
for the whole city as now constituted was 19 persons to the acre,
in Manhattan 149; in the south-eastern district of Manhattan
382 and in one ward 735. Between 1900 and 1905 the density
increased in every district, and in the latter year there were 12 blocks
with from 1000 to 1400 persons to the acre. The number of persons
to the acre in London (1901) is 60.6; in the most densely populated
borough 182, and in the most densely populated district (a very
small one) 396. This will give a measure of comparison. The large
tenement blocks in New York have been constructed with far less
regard to health than those in Berlin, and reproduce in an aggravated
form the same evil of insufficient light and air. In place of the
inadequate courts round which many are built in Berlin, the New
York tenements have merely narrow air shafts. In 1904 there were
reported to be 362,000 dark interior rooms, that is with no outside
windows.

If American cities have nothing to learn from other countries in
regard to bad housing, they have nothing to teach in the way of
reform. They are following Europe slowly and a long distance
behind. There is no serious attempt to deal with insanitary areas
as they have been dealt with in England, or to prevent the creation
of new ones by regulation and planning of extensions as in Germany,
or to promote the provision of superior houses by organized public
effort as in several countries. A little has been done in New York
to improve the worst housing. A Tenement House Act was passed
after the report of the Commission of 1895 and a Department formed
to give effect to it. Some cleansing and repairing and insertion of
windows is carried out every year, but more attention seems to be
paid to fire escapes. Societies for providing improved dwellings
exist in New York, Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia. The oldest
is one formed in Boston in 1871, called the Co-operative Building
Company; it was followed in 1876 by an Improved Dwellings
Company in Brooklyn, and in 1879 by a similar society in Manhattan,
and in 1885 by another in Boston. The largest concern of the kind
is the City and Suburban Houses Company in New York, formed in
1896 under the guidance of Dr E. R. L. Gould; it has built four
groups of tenements housing 1238 families in the city and 112 houses
on a suburban estate at Brooklyn; in all it has housed some 6000
persons. More recently Mr Henry Phipps has given £200,000 for
the provision of model dwellings in New York, and a building has
been erected on the plan of the Maison des Enfants in Paris. In
Chicago the City Houses Association works at housing reforms in
various ways. There are some other institutions of a like kind,
but the aggregate results are inconsiderable. Two other building
agencies have done far more in the United States than philanthropic
societies; these are the building and loan associations and private
employers. The former are co-operative provident societies; they
are widely diffused throughout the United States and their operations
are on a very large scale. They date from 1831, when the Oxford
Provident Building Association was formed at Frankfort, near
Philadelphia. Pennsylvania has still the largest number of associations,
but from 1843 onwards the movement spread rapidly and
continuously in other states. The high-water mark appears to have
been reached in 1897, when the total assets of the associations
amounted to about £133,000,000. In 1905 there were 5326 associations
with an aggregate membership of 1,686,611 and assets of
about £130,000,000. The states of Pennsylvania and Ohio head
the list, but the movement is very strong in many others. It accounts
for the comparatively large number of houses owned by working-class
families in the United States. With regard to housing by
employers, no comprehensive information is available, but the total
amount is certainly considerable though probably not so large as
in Germany or in France. Some of the better-known instances are
the Pelzer Manufacturing Company at Pelzer in South Carolina,
which has built about 1000 dwellings; the Maryland Steel Company
at Sparrows Point, Maryland, 800 dwellings; Ludlow Manufacturing
Associates at Ludlow, Mass., 500 dwellings; Whitin Machine
Works at Whitinsville, Mass., 600 dwellings; Westinghouse Air
Brake Co. at Wilmerding, Penn., 360 dwellings; Draper Co., Hopedale,
Mass., 250 dwellings. These are all more or less &ldquo;model&rdquo;
settlements, not in cities, but in outlying or country places, where
works have been established, and that is generally true of housing
by employers in the United States, whereas in Germany much has
been provided by them in the large towns. Rents are very much
higher in American cities than in European towns of comparable
size and character.

HOUSMAN, LAURENCE (1867-&emsp;&emsp;), English writer and
artist, was born on the 18th of June 1867. Having studied
at South Kensington, he first made a reputation as a book-illustrator.
Some of his best pictorial work may be seen in the
editions of Meredith&rsquo;s Jump to Glory Jane (1892), the Weird
Tales of Jonas Lie (1892), Jane Barlow&rsquo;s Land of Elfintoun
(1894), Christina Rossetti&rsquo;s Goblin Market (1893), Werewolf
(1896), by his sister, Miss Clemence Housman, Shelley&rsquo;s Sensitive
Plant (1898), and his own Farm in Fairyland (1894). His
designs were engraved on wood by Miss Housman. His volumes
of verse include Green Arras (1896), Rue (1899), Spikenard
(1898) and Mendicant Rhymes (1906); and the mysticism which
characterizes the devotional poems in Spikenard recurs in his
half-allegorical tales, All Fellows (1896), The Blue Moon (1904)
and The Cloak of Friendship (1906). His nativity play, Bethlehem,
was presented in the Great Hall of London University at South
Kensington for a week in December 1902. In 1900 he published
anonymously An Englishwoman&rsquo;s Love Letters, which created
a temporary sensation; and he followed this essay in popular
fiction by the novels A Modem Antaeus (1901) and Sabrina
Warham (1904). On the 23rd of December 1904 his fantastic
play Prunella, written in collaboration with Mr Granville
Barker, was produced at the Court Theatre.

His brother, Alfred Edward Housman (b. 1859), an accomplished
scholar, professor of Latin at University College, London,
is known as a poet by his striking lyrical series, A Shropshire
Lad (1896).



HOUSSAYE, ARSÈNE (1815-1896), French novelist, poet
and man of letters, was born at Bruyères (Aisne), near Laon, on
the 28th of March 1815. His real surname was Housset. In
1832 he found his way to Paris, and in 1836 he published two
novels, La Couronne de bluets and La Pécheresse. He had many
friends in Paris, among them Jules Janin and Théophile Gautier,
and he wrote in collaboration with Jules Sandeau. He produced
art criticism in L&rsquo;Histoire de la peinture flamande et hollandaise
(1846); semi-historical sketches In Mlle de la Vallière et Mme
de Montespan (1860) and Galerie de portraits du XVIIe siècle
(1844); literary criticism in Le Roi Voltaire (1858) and his
famous satirical Histoire du quarante et unième fauteuil de
l&rsquo;académie française (1855); drama in his Comédiennes (1857);
poetry in his Symphonie des vingt ans (1867), Cent et un sonnets
828
(1873), &amp;c.; and novels, Les Filles d&rsquo;Ève (1852) and many others.
In 1849, through the influence of Rachel, he was entrusted with
the administration of the Théâtre Français, a position he filled
with unfailing tact and success until 1859, when he was made
inspector-general of works of art. He died on the 26th of
February 1896.


His Confessions, souvenir; d&rsquo;un démi-siècle appeared in 1885-1891.
See also J. Lemaître, Arsène Houssaye (1897), with a bibliography.


His son, Henry Houssaye (1848-&emsp;&emsp;), the historian, was
born in Paris. His early writings were devoted to classical
antiquity, studied not only in books but on the actual Greek
sites which he visited in 1868. He published successively
Histoire d&rsquo;Apelles (1867), a study on Greek art; L&rsquo;Armée dans
la Grèce antique (1867); Histoire d&rsquo;Alcibiade et de la république
athénienne depuis la mort de Périclès jusqu&rsquo;à l&rsquo;avènement des

and two volumes of miscellanies, Athènes, Rome, Paris, l&rsquo;histoire
et les m&oelig;urs (1879), and Aspasie, Cléopatre, Théodora (6th ed.
1889). The military history of Napoleon I. then attracted him.
His first volume on this subject, called 1814 (1888), went through
no fewer than forty-six editions. It was followed by 1815, the
first part of which comprises the first Restoration, the return
from Elba and the Hundred Days (1893); the second part,
Waterloo (1899); and the third part, the second abdication
and the White Terror (1905). He was elected a member of the
French Academy in 1895.



HOUSTON, SAM, or Samuel (1793-1863), American general and
statesman, of Scotch-Irish descent, was born near Lexington,
Virginia, on the 2nd of March 1793. His father, who had
fought in the War of Independence, died in 1806, and soon
afterward Samuel removed with his mother to the frontier in
Blount county, Tennessee. When he was about fifteen his
elder brothers obtained for him a place as clerk in a trader&rsquo;s
store, but he ran away and lived with the Cherokee Indians of
East Tennessee for nearly three years. On his return he opened
a country school, and later attended a session or two of the
Academy at Maryville. During the War of 1812 he served under
Andrew Jackson against the Creek Indians, and his bravery
at the battle of Tohopeka, in which he was disabled by several
wounds, won promotion to a lieutenancy. In 1817 he was
appointed sub-agent in managing the business relating to the
removal of the Cherokees from East Tennessee to a reservation
in what is now Arkansas, but he was offended at a rebuke from
John C. Calhoun, then secretary of war, for appearing before
him in Indian garments, as well as at an inquiry into charges
affecting his official integrity, and he resigned in 1818. He
entered a law office in Nashville, and was admitted to the bar,
and was soon elected a district attorney. From 1823 to 1827
Houston represented the ninth district of Tennessee in Congress,
and in 1827 was elected governor of the state by the Jackson
Democrats. He married Eliza Allen in January 1829; his wife
left him three months later, and he resigned his office of governor,
again took up his residence among the Cherokees, who were at
this time about to remove to Indian Territory, and was formally
adopted a member of their nation.

In 1830 and again in 1832 he visited Washington to expose
the frauds practised upon the Cherokees by government agents,
and attracted national attention by an encounter on the 13th
of April 1832 with William Stanberry, a Congressman from
Ohio, who intimated that Houston himself was seeking to defraud
them. Commissioned by President Jackson, Houston went to
Texas in December 1832 to negotiate treaties with the Indian
tribes there for the protection of American traders on the border.
He decided to remain in Texas, and was elected a delegate to
the constitutional convention which met at San Felipe on the
1st of April 1833 to draw up a memorial to the Mexican Congress
asking for the separation of Texas from Coahuila, in which the
anti-American party was in control, as well as to frame a constitution
for the commonwealth as a new member of the Mexican
Republic, and he served as chairman of the drafting committee,
and took a prominent part in the preparations for war when
next year the petition was refused. In October 1835, soon after
the outbreak of the War for Texan Independence, the committees
of the township of Nacogdoches chose Houston as commander-in-chief
of the forces in eastern Texas, and after the San Felipe
convention in November he was chosen commander-in-chief
of the Texan army. On the 21st of April 1836, while in command
of 743 raw troops, he met on the bank of the San
Jacinto about 1600 Mexican veterans led by Santa Anna and
completely routed them; on the next day Santa Anna was
taken prisoner.

Texan independence was won by this victory (although the Mexican
government repudiated the treaty negotiated by Santa Anna),
and Houston was elected president of Texas (1st of September)
and was inaugurated on the 22nd of October. His term expired
in December 1838; he was elected again in 1841 and served until
1844. During his first term a newly founded city was named in
his honour and this was the seat of government in 1837-39 and in
1842-45. Texas having been admitted as a state of the American
Union in 1845, Houston was elected one of its first two United
States senators. He served as a stalwart Union Democrat from
March 1846 until 1859; he opposed the Kansas-Nebraska
bill in an able speech (3rd March 1854), and spoke frequently
in defence of the rights of the Indians. In 1859 he was elected
governor of Texas and tried to prevent the secession of his state;
upon his refusal, in March 1861, to swear allegiance to the
Confederacy he was declared deposed. He died at Huntsville,
Texas, on the 26th of July 1863. Houston was an able soldier,
wary, intrepid and resolute; and was a legislator of rare foresight,
cool discrimination and fearless candour.

HOUSTON, a city and the county-seat of Harris county, Texas,
U.S.A., at the head of deep-sea navigation on Buffalo Bayou,
a tributary of Galveston Bay, 50 m. N.W. of Galveston, and
about 325 m. W. of New Orleans. Pop. (1880) 16,513; (1890)
27,557; (1900) 44,633, of whom 4415 were foreign-born and
14,608 were negroes; (1910 census) 78,800. The land area
in 1906 was 16.02 sq. m.; in 1908, about 20 sq. m. It is served
by the Galveston, Harrisburg &amp; San Antonio (Southern Pacific),
the Galveston, Houston &amp; Henderson, the Gulf, Colorado
&amp; Santa Fe, the Houston &amp; Texas Central (Southern Pacific),
the Houston, East &amp; West Texas, the International &amp; Great
Northern, the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas, the San Antonio &amp;
Aransas Pass, the Trinity &amp; Brazos Valley, the St Louis, Brownsville
&amp; Mexico, the Texas &amp; New Orleans, and the Houston Belt
&amp; Terminal railways, several of which have their headquarters
at Houston. The Federal government has greatly improved
the natural channel from the city to the Gulf of Mexico, straightening,
widening and deepening it to a depth of 25 ft. for the entire
distance from the Galveston jetties to the Houston turning
basin&mdash;where the municipality has constructed free municipal
wharves. The city occupies an unusually fine site on both sides
of the Buffalo Bayou. Among the principal buildings are a
Carnegie library, the Houston Lyceum, the Federal building,
the Masonic temple, the city high school, the city hall and
market house, the Harris County Court House, the Cotton
Exchange, and the First and Commercial National banks.
Houston is the seat of the Texas Dental College, of St Thomas
College (1903), and of the Houston, Annunciation and St Agnes
academies; and the will (1901) of William Marsh Rice provided
an endowment (valued in 1908 at about $7,000,000) for the
William M. Rice Institute for the Advancement of Literature,
Science and Art, of which Dr Edgar Odell Lovett, formerly
professor of mathematics (1900-1905) and of astronomy (1905-1908)
in Princeton University, was made president in 1908.
The city is the most important railway and shipping centre of
South Texas, and has a large trade in cotton (the receipts for
the year ending Aug. 31, 1907 being 2,967,535 bales), cotton-seed
829
oil, sugar, rice,1 lumber and citrus fruits. Houston is important
also as a manufacturing centre, its factory product being valued
at $13,564,019 in 1905, an increase of 81% over the factory
product in 1900. There are extensive railway car-shops, cotton-seed
oil, petroleum and sugar refineries, cotton gins and compresses,
steel rolling mills, car-wheel factories, boiler, pump and
engine works, flour mills, rice mills and a rice elevator, breweries,
planing and saw-mills, pencil factories, and brick and tile factories.
Its proximity to the Texas oil fields gives the city a cheap factory
fuel. The assessed valuation of taxable property in the city
increased from $27,480,898 in 1900 to $51,513,615 in 1908.
The No-Tsu Oh Carnival week each November is a distinctive
feature of the city. Houston, like Galveston, adopted in 1905
a very successful system of municipal government by commission,
a commission of five (one of whom acts as mayor) being elected
biennially and having both executive and legislative powers.
The waterworks are owned and operated by the municipality,
which greatly improved them from the city&rsquo;s surplus under the
first two years of government by commission. In 1908 extensive
improvements in paving, drainage and sewerage were undertaken
by the city. The payment of an annual poll-tax of $2.50 is
a prerequisite to voting. Houston was settled and laid out in
1836, and was named in honour of General Sam Houston, whose
home in Caroline Street was standing in 1908. In 1837-1839
and in 1842-1845 Houston was the capital of the Republic of
Texas. About 15 m. E.S.E. of the city is the battleground of
San Jacinto, which was bought by the state in 1906 for a public
memorial park.

farmers.




HOUWALD, CHRISTOPH ERNST, Freiherr von (1778-1845),
German dramatist and author, was born at Straupitz
in Lower Lusatia, a son of the president of the district court of
justice, on the 28th of November 1778. He studied law at the
university of Halle, and on completion of his academic studies
returned home, married, and managed the family estates. In
1816 he afforded a home to his friend K. W. S. Contessa (1777-1825),
himself a poet, who had met with serious reverses of
fortune; Contessa lived with Houwald, assisting and stimulating
him in his literary work, for eight years. In 1821 Houwald was
unanimously elected syndic for Lower Lusatia, an office which
placed him at the head of the administration of the province.
He died at Neuhaus, near Lübben, on the 28th of January 1845.


Houwald is remembered as the author of several so-called &ldquo;Fate
tragedies&rdquo; (see German Literature), of which the best known are
Das Bild, Der Leuchtturm, Die Heimkehr, Fluch und Segen (all
published in 1821). They have, however, small literary value, and
Houwald is seen to better advantage in his narratives and books for
juvenile readers, such as Romantische Akkorde (publ. by W. Contessa,
Berlin, 1817); Buch für Kinder gebildeter Stände (1819-1824); and
Jakob Thau, der Hofnarr (1821). Houwald&rsquo;s collected works,
Sämtliche Werke, were published in five volumes (Leipzig, 1851;
2nd ed., 1858-1859). See J. Minor, Die Schicksalstragödie in ihren
Hauptvertretern (Frankfurt, 1883), and Das Schicksalsdrama in
Kürschner&rsquo;s Deutsche Nationalliteratur; vol. cli. (Stuttgart, 1884);

HÒVA, the name originally applied to the middle-class Malayo-Indonesian
natives of Madagascar (q.v.), as distinct from the
noble class Andrìana and the slave class Andèvo. Hòva has now
come to mean the most numerous and powerful of the tribes
which form the native population of Madagascar. The Hòva,
who occupy the province of Imérina, the central plateau of the
island, are of Malayo-Indonesian origin. The period at which
the Hòva arrived in Madagascar is still a subject of dispute.
Some think that the immigration took place in very early times,
before Hinduism reached the Malay Archipelago, since no trace
of Sanskrit is found in Malagasy. Others believe that the Hòva
did not reach the island until the 12th or 13th century. At the
French conquest of Madagascar (1895), the Hòva were the most
powerful and, politically, the dominant people; but were far
from having subjected the whole of the island to their rule.
The Hòva are short and slim, with a complexion of a yellowish
olive, many being fairer than the average of southern Europeans.
Their hair is long, black and smooth but coarse. Their heads
are round, with flat straight foreheads, flat faces, prominent
cheekbones, small straight noses, fairly wide nostrils, and small
black and slightly oblique eyes. The physical contrast to the
negro is usually very obvious, but, especially among the lower
classes, there is a tendency to thick lips, kinky hair and dark
skin. In many of their customs, such as taboo, infanticide,
marriage and funeral rites, they show their Indonesian origin.
Most of them now profess Christianity.



HOVE, a municipal borough of Sussex, England, adjoining the
watering-place of Brighton on the west, on the London, Brighton,
&amp; South Coast railway. Pop. (1901) 36,535. The great seawall
of Brighton continues along the front at Hove, forming a
pleasant promenade. Here is the Sussex county cricket ground.
The municipal borough, incorporated in 1898, includes the
parishes of Hove and Aldrington, of which the first is within the
parliamentary borough of Brighton, but the second is in the
Lewes division of the county. The corporation consists of a
mayor, 10 aldermen and 30 councillors. Area, 1521 acres.



HOVENDEN, THOMAS (1840-1895), American artist, was
born in Dunmanway, Co. Cork, Ireland, on the 28th of
December 1840. He was a pupil of the South Kensington Art
Schools and those of the National Academy of Design, New
York, whither he had removed in 1863. Subsequently he went
to Paris and studied in the École des Beaux Arts under Cabanel,
but passed most of his time with the American colony in Brittany,
at Pont-Aven, where he painted many pictures of the peasantry.
Returning to America in 1880, he became an academician in
1882, and attracted attention by an important canvas of &ldquo;The
Last Moments of John Brown&rdquo; (now in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art). His &ldquo;Breaking Home Ties,&rdquo; a picture of
American farm life, was engraved with considerable popular
success. Hovenden was mortally injured in a heroic effort to
save a child from a railroad train in the station at Germantown,
near Philadelphia, and died at Norristown, Pennsylvania, on the
14th of August 1895. Among his principal works are:&mdash;&ldquo;News
from the Conscript&rdquo; (1877), &ldquo;Loyalist Peasant Soldier of La
Vendée&rdquo; (1879). &ldquo;A Breton Interior,&rdquo; &ldquo;Image Seller&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Jerusalem the Golden&rdquo; (in the Metropolitan Museum of Art).



HOW, WILLIAM WALSHAM (1823-1897), English divine, son
of a Shrewsbury solicitor, was born on the 13th of December
1823, and was educated at Shrewsbury school and Wadham
College, Oxford. He was ordained in 1846, and for upwards of
thirty years was actively engaged in parish work at Whittington
in Shropshire and Oswestry (rural dean, 1860). He refused
preferment on several occasions, but his energy and success made
him well known, and in 1879 he became a suffragan bishop in
London, under the title of bishop of Bedford, his province being
the East End. There he became the inspiring influence of a
revival of church work. He founded the East London Church
Fund, and enlisted a large band of enthusiastic helpers, his
popularity among all classes being immense. He was particularly
fond of children, and was commonly called &ldquo;the children&rsquo;s
bishop.&rdquo; In 1888 he was made bishop of Wakefield, and in the
north of England he continued to do valuable work. His sermons
were straightforward, earnest and attractive; and besides
publishing several volumes of these, he wrote a good deal of
verse, including such well-known hymns as &ldquo;Who is this so
weak and helpless,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord, Thy children guide and keep.&rdquo; In
1863-1868 he brought out a Commentary on the Four Gospels;
and he also wrote a Manual for the Holy Communion. In the
movement for infusing new spiritual life into the church services,
especially among the poor, How was a great force. He died on
the 10th of August 1897. He was much helped in his earlier
work by his wife. Frances A. Douglas (d. 1887).


See his Life by his son, F. D. How (1898).




HOWARD (Family). Among English families, the house of
Howard has long held the first place. Its head, the duke of
Norfolk, is the first of the dukes and the hereditary earl marshal
of England, while the earls of Suffolk, Carlisle and Effingham and
the Lord Howard of Glossop represent in the peerage its younger
lines.

Its founder was a Norfolk lawyer, William Howard or Haward,
830
who was summoned to parliament as a justice in 1295, being
appointed a justice of the common pleas in 1297. Over the
parentage of this man genealogists have disputed for centuries.
The pedigree-makers have hailed him in turn as the descendant
of a Norman &ldquo;Auber, earl of Passy&rdquo; and as the heir of Hereward,
&ldquo;the last of the English.&rdquo; But out of the copies of Norfolk
deeds and records collected for Thomas, earl of Arundel, in the
early part of the 17th century, it seems clear enough that he
sprang from a Norfolk family, several of whose members held
lands at Wiggenhall near Lynn. These notes from deeds,
evidently collected by an honest inquirer, make no extravagant
claims of ancient ancestry or illustrious origin for the Howards,
although the facts contained in them were recklessly manipulated
by subservient genealogists. Doubtless the judge was the son
of John Howard of Wiggenhall, living about 1260, whose widow
Lucy, called by the genealogists the daughter of John Germund,
was probably the wife of John Germund by her second marriage.
William Howard was employed as counsel by the corporation of
Lynn, and it is worthy of note that the &ldquo;crosslets fitchy&rdquo; in his
shield of arms suggest the cross with which the dragon was
discomfited by St Margaret, the patroness of Lynn. Prospering
by the law, William Howard of Wiggenhall rose to knight&rsquo;s
rank and acquired by purchase Grancourt&rsquo;s manor in East
Winch, near Lynn, where he had his seat in a moated house
whose ruins remain. He was probably dead and buried in his
chapel at East Winch before November 27, 1308, the date of the
patent by which Henry Scrope succeeded him as a commissioner
of trailbaston. His two wives, Alice Ufford and Alice Fitton&mdash;heir
of Fitton&rsquo;s manor in Wiggenhall&mdash;were both daughters of
knightly houses. Before his death his eldest son, John Howard,
was a knight and already advanced by his marriage with Joan of
Cornwall, one of the bastard line founded by Richard of Cornwall,
king of the Romans.

Sir John Howard served in Edward II.&rsquo;s wars in Scotland and
Gascony, was sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk and governor of
Norwich Castle. When he died in 1331 he was seised of many
Norfolk manors. His son and heir, another Sir John, admiral of
the king&rsquo;s navy in the north, was a banneret who displayed his
banner in the army that laid siege to Calais. By the admiral&rsquo;s wife
Alice, sister and heir of Sir Robert de Boys, the Howards had the
Boys manor of Fersfield, near Diss, which is still among the
possessions of the dukes of Norfolk. His son Sir Robert Howard,
who had married a daughter of Sir Robert Scales (Lord Scales),
died in 1388. From Sir John Howard, the only son of Sir Robert,
two branches of the house of Howard spring. The elder line was
soon extinct. By his first wife, Margaret, daughter and heir of
Sir John Plays, Sir John Howard had a son who died before him,
leaving a daughter through whom descended to her issue, the
Veres, earls of Oxford, the ancient Norfolk estates of the Howards
at East Winch and elsewhere, with the lands of the houses of
Scales, Plays and Walton, brought in by the brides of her forefathers.
After the death of Margaret Plays, her widower found,
with the peculiar instinct of his race, a second well-endowed
wife. By her, the heir of the Tendrings of Tendring, he had a
second son, Sir Robert Howard, a knight who fought under
Henry V. in France, and died, like his half-brother, before the old
knight&rsquo;s career ended in 1436.

It is to the marriage of this young knight that the house of
Howard owes the tragedy of its greatness. He was a younger
son, although he had some of his mother&rsquo;s inheritance. Had he
married the landless daughter of a neighbour he might have been
the ancestor of a line of Essex squires, whose careers would have
had the parish topographer for chronicler. But his bride was
Margaret Mowbray, daughter of the banished duke of Norfolk.
Although this was a noble alliance, it is probable that the lady
had no great portion. The head of her elder brother, the boy
earl marshal, had been stricken off in the cornfield under the
walls of York, but her younger brother&rsquo;s right to his father&rsquo;s
dukedom was allowed by parliament in 1425.

Sir John Howard, only son of the match between Howard
and Mowbray, took service with his cousin the third duke of
Norfolk, who had him returned as knight of the shire for Norfolk,
where, according to the Paston Letters, this Howard of the
Essex branch was regarded by the gentry as a strange man.
He followed the White Rose and was knighted at the crowning
of King Edward IV., who pricked him for sheriff of Norfolk and
Suffolk. In the duke&rsquo;s quarrel he brawled with the Pastons,
his wife boasting that, should her husband&rsquo;s men meet with
John Paston &ldquo;there should go no penny for his life.&rdquo; &ldquo;And
Howard,&rdquo; writes Clement Paston, &ldquo;hath with the king a great
fellowship.&rdquo; Offices and lands came to John Howard by reason
of that fellowship. Henry VI., when restored, summoned him
to parliament in 1470 as Lord Howard, a summons which may
have been meant to lure him to London into Warwick&rsquo;s power,
but he proclaimed the Yorkist sovereign on his return and
fought at Barnet and Tewkesbury. When peace was made,
Edward summoned him again as a baron and gave him the
Garter and the treasurership of his household. After Edward&rsquo;s
burial, at which he bore the king&rsquo;s banner, Howard, an enemy
of the Wydviles, linked his fortunes with those of the duke of
Gloucester. At this time came his sudden lifting to the highest
rank in the peerage. The last of the dukes of Norfolk had left
a child heir, Anne Mowbray, married to the infant duke of York,
the younger of the princes doomed by Richard in the Tower.
By the death of this little girl, John Howard became one of the
coheirs of her illustrious house, which was now represented by
the issue of Margaret Mowbray, his mother, and of her sister
Isabel, who had married James, Lord Berkeley. A lion&rsquo;s share
of the Mowbray estates, swollen by the great alliances of the
house, heir of Breouse and Segrave, and, through Segrave, of
Thomas of Brotherton, son of Edward I., fell to Howard, who,
by a patent of June 28, 1483, was created duke of Norfolk and
earl marshal of England with a remainder to the heirs male of
his body. On the same day the lord Berkeley, the other coheir,
was made earl of Nottingham. High steward at Richard&rsquo;s
crowning, the duke bore the crown and rode as marshal into
Westminster Hall. For the rest of his life he was Richard&rsquo;s
man, and though warned by the famous couplet that &ldquo;Dykon
his master&rdquo; was bought and sold, &ldquo;Jack of Norfolk&rdquo; led the
archer vanguard at Bosworth and died in the fight, from which
his son the earl of Surrey was carried away a wounded prisoner.
An attainder by the first parliament of Henry VII. extinguished
the honours of the father with those of the son, who had been
created an earl when the lord Howard was raised to the dukedom.
Their estates were forfeit.

Thomas Howard, a politic mind, loyal to the powers that be,
was released from the Tower of London in 1489, his earldom
of Surrey and his Garter restored. Accepting the position
in which the Tudor king would have his great nobles, he became
the faithful soldier, diplomatist and official of the new power.
In his seventieth year, as lieutenant-general of the North, he
led the English host on the great day of Flodden, earning a
patent of the dukedom of Norfolk, dated 1 February 1513/4,
and that strange patent which granted to him and his heirs
that they should bear in the midst of the silver bend of their
Howard shield a demi-lion stricken in the mouth with an arrow,
in the right colours of the arms of the king of Scotland. This
augmentation has been interpreted as a golden scocheon with the
demi-lion within the Scottish tressure. Thus charged on the
silver bend, it makes bad armory and it is worthy of note that,
although the grant of it is clearly to the duke and his heirs in
fee simple, Howards of all branches descending from the duke
bear it in their shields, even though all right to it has long passed
from the house to the duke&rsquo;s heirs general, the Stourtons and
Petres.

The victor of Flodden is the common ancestor of all living
Howards that can show a descent from the main stock. The
second duke, twice married, was father of at least eleven sons
and six daughters, the sons including Edward the lord high
admiral, killed in boarding Prégent&rsquo;s galleys at Brest, Edmund
the knight marshal of the army at Flodden, and William the
first Lord Howard of Effingham. The eldest son, Thomas,
succeeded as the third duke of his name, although the second
under the patent of 1514. He had fought as captain of the
831
vanguard at Flodden and after the victory was created earl of
Surrey. When Richard III. was allying himself with the Howards,
Thomas Howard, a boy of eleven, had been betrothed to Anne,
daughter of the late King Edward IV., and Henry VII. allowed
the marriage with his queen&rsquo;s sister to take place in 1495. This
royal bride died of consumption, leaving no living child,
and her husband took in 1513, as his second wife, Elizabeth
Stafford, daughter of that duke of Buckingham upon whom the
old duke of Norfolk, the tears upon his cheeks, was forced to
pass sentence of death. Succeeding his father in 1524, Norfolk
was created earl marshal in 1533. An unsuccessful diplomatist,
his chief services in arms were the butchery in the north after
the Pilgrimage of Grace and the raid into Scotland which ended
with the rout of Solway Moss. He left his wife for a mistress,
Elizabeth Holland, was in discord with his family, and lived to
see his two nieces, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, and his
son Surrey, the fiery-tempered poet, go in turn to the block.
He himself was attainted and was lying a prisoner in the Tower,
doomed to die in the morning, on the night of the death of
Henry VIII. He was not released until the accession of Mary,
parliament restoring his dukedom on his petition for reversal
of the attainder. His grandson Thomas succeeded him in 1554,
and in 1556 made the second of those marriages which have
given the Howards their high place among the English nobility.
The bride was Mary, sole heir in her issue of her father Henry,
the last of the Fitzalan earls of Arundel. Her father&rsquo;s line and
the royal Stewards of Scotland sprang from one forefather,
Alan, son of Flaald the Breton. The Mowbray match had already
brought to the Howards the representation of an elder line
of the Fitzalan earls, who sat in the seats of their ancestors,
the Aubignys and Warennes, great earls near akin to their
sovereigns. And now the younger line, earls of Arundel and
Lords Mautravers, were also to have a Howard to represent
them. From this time the spreading genealogy of the Howards
drew its origins from most of the illustrious names of the houses
founded after the Norman Conquest.

The young duchess died in her seventeenth year after giving
birth to a son, and the duke took a second wife from a humble
stock, newly enriched and honoured, the daughter of Henry
VIII.&rsquo;s subservient chancellor, the Lord Audley of Walden.
Within ten years he married a third time, the lady being Elizabeth
Leybourne, the widow of Lord Dacre of Gilsland. She survived
her marriage but a few months and her husband then obtained
the wardship of her Dacre offspring, a son who died young, and
three daughters whom the duke, with the true Howard eye for
a rich inheritance, gave as brides to three of his sons. After three
such good fortunes by marriage Norfolk in his folly looked for
a crown with a fourth match, listening to the laird of Lethington
when he set forth the scheme by which the duke was to marry
a restored queen of Scots and rule Scotland with her who should
be recognized as Elizabeth&rsquo;s successor. Ten months in the Tower
under strong suspicion would have warned another man, but
Norfolk was unstable and false. After promising fidelity and
the abandonment of the Scots marriage scheme, Cecil took him
corresponding with Mary and tampering with the Ridolfi plot.
He died on Tower Hill in 1572 for an example to the disloyal
counties, protesting innocence and repentance, warning his
children in a last letter to discredit all &ldquo;false bruits&rdquo; that he
was a papist.

By his attainder the Norfolk titles were once more forfeited.
But Philip Howard, the son and heir, succeeded to the ancient
earldom of Arundel in 1580, on the death of his maternal grandfather,
while the Lord Lumley, his uncle by marriage, surrendered
to him his life interest in the castle and honour of Arundel.
The next year an act of parliament restored the earl in blood.
After a profligate youth at court, he followed his wife in professing
the Roman faith, and in 1585 made an attempt to leave
England to seek safety from the penal laws. But his ship was
boarded in the Channel and the earl, condemned by the Star-Chamber
to a heavy fine and to imprisonment during the queen&rsquo;s
pleasure, suffered a harsh captivity in the Tower. After the
defeat of the Armada he had been condemned to death on a
charge of high treason, founded on the tale drawn by torture from
a priest, that Arundel had urged him to say a mass for the success
of the Spaniards. But he was allowed to linger in his prison
until 1595 when he died, the sight of his wife and children being
cruelly refused to the dying man. Thus it befell that, of the chiefs
of the Howards born since the great Mowbray alliance, two had
died by the axe and one in the prison from which a fourth had
hardly escaped. A fifth had fallen in a lost battle, and only one
had died in peace in his own house.

The ill fate of the Howards seemed to be appeased by the
death of Philip, earl of Arundel. Tudor policy did its work well,
and noblemen, however illustrious their pedigrees, could no
longer be counted as menaces by the Crown, which was, indeed,
finding another rival to its power. In the first year of James I.,
Thomas, the young son of Earl Philip, was restored in blood and
given the titles of Arundel and Surrey. But the lands belonging
to these titles remained with the Crown and he had to repair his
fortunes by one of those marriages which never failed his house,
his wife being Alathea Talbot, who was at last the heir of Gilbert,
earl of Shrewsbury. To the grief of his mother he left the Roman
church. A knight of the Garter, he was in 1621 created earl
marshal for life, and revived the jurisdiction belonging to the
office. An act of 1627, one of several such aimed at aggrandizing
families by diverting the descent of dignities in fee from heirs
general, entailed the earldom and castle of Arundel upon Thomas,
earl of Arundel and Surrey and the heirs male of his body &ldquo;and
for default of such issue, to the heirs of his body.&rdquo; His pride
and austerity made him unpopular at court and he left the
country in 1642, settling at last in Padua, where he died in
1646, impoverished by the sequestrations of the parliament,
whose forces had taken and retaken his castle of Arundel.
In answer to his petition for the dukedom, the king had, on
the 6th of June 1644, given him a patent of the earldom of
Norfolk, in order, as it would seem, to flatter him by suggesting
that the title of Norfolk would at least be refused to any other
family. He is celebrated as a collector of paintings, books, gems
and sculptures, his &ldquo;Arundel marbles&rdquo; being given by his
grandson in 1667 to the University of Oxford. The dukedom
for which Arundel had petitioned Charles I. in vain was restored
by act of the first parliament of Charles II. to his grandson
Thomas, a lunatic living at Padua, on whose death in 1677 it
passed to this Thomas&rsquo;s brother, Henry Frederick, who had been
created earl of Norwich and hereditary earl marshal of England
in 1672. In 1777 Edward, the ninth of the Howard dukes, died
childless in his ninety-second year. With him ended the earldom
of Norwich, while the representation of the Mowbrays and
Segraves passed to his nieces, the Ladies Stourton and Petre,
the abeyance of the two baronies being determined in 1878 in
favour of Lord Stourton. Under the act of 1627 the earldom
of Arundel and the castle passed with the dukedom to a second
cousin, Charles Howard of Greystock (d. 1786), an eccentric
recluse. At his death in 1786 he was succeeded by his son
Charles, the notorious &ldquo;Jockey of Norfolk,&rdquo; the big, coarse,
generous, slovenly, hard-drinking Whig of whom all the memoir-writers
of his age have their anecdotes. He conformed to the
Church of England and spent a vast sum in restoring Arundel
Castle. A third cousin succeeded him in 1815, Bernard Edward
Howard, who, although a Roman Catholic, was enabled, by the
act of 1824, to act as earl marshal. This was the grandfather
of the fifteenth duke, earl of Arundel, Surrey and Norfolk, and
hereditary earl marshal of England.


The eldest of the cadet branches of the ducal house has its origin
in William (c. 1510-1573), eldest son of the victor of Flodden by his
second marriage. He survived the reign of Henry VIII., that
perilous age for the Howards, with no worse misadventure than the
conviction of himself and his wife of misprision of treason in concealing
the offences of his niece, Queen Catherine. But both were pardoned.
In 1553 he had the office of lord admiral of England, and in the next
year the Garter. For his services against Sir Thomas Wyat he
was created (March 11, 1553/4) Lord Howard of Effingham, the
title being taken from a Surrey manor granted him by Edward VI.
Queen Elizabeth continued his employment in diplomacy, and had
he been richer he might have had an earldom. His eldest son
Charles (1536-1624), lord admiral of England in 1585, sailed as
832
commander in chief against the Spanish Armada, and, although
giving due weight to the counsel of Drake and his other officers,
showed himself a leader as prudent as courageous. He was created
earl of Nottingham in 1596 and died in 1624. The legend that the
admiral was a Roman Catholic has no authority. Two of his sons
succeeded in turn to the earldom of Nottingham, extinct on the
death of Charles, the third earl in 1681. Sir William Howard of
Lingfield, younger brother of the great admiral, carried on the
Effingham line, his great-grandson succeeding to the barony on the
extinction of the earldom. Francis, seventh Lord Howard of
Effingham, was created earl of Effingham in 1731, a title extinct in
1816 with the fourth earl, but revived again in 1837 for the eleventh
baron, who had served as a general officer in the Peninsular campaign,
the great-grandfather of the present peer.

A patent of 1604 created Henry Howard (1540-1614), younger
son of Surrey the poet, earl of Northampton, a peerage which ended
with the death of this, the most unprincipled of his house.

Thomas, son of the fourth duke of Norfolk&rsquo;s marriage with the
daughter and heir of Thomas, Lord Audley of Walden, founded the
line of the present earls of Suffolk and Berkshire and of the extinct
Lords Howard of Escrick. His barony of Howard of Walden has
descended to his heirs general. Lord William Howard (1563-1640),
the &ldquo;belted Will&rdquo; of Scott&rsquo;s Lay and the &ldquo;bauld Willie&rdquo; of more
authentic legend, was another of the sons of the fourth duke and
Margaret Audley. Married in 1577 to one of the three co-heirs of
the Lord Dacre of Gilsland he suffered under Elizabeth more than
one imprisonment with his brother the unfortunate earl of Arundel.
But in 1603 he was able, on the partition of the Dacre lands, to
make his home at Naworth Castle, where he lived, a border patriarch,
cultivating his estates and serving as a commissioner of the borders.
His great-grandson Charles Howard, although fledged in a nest of
cavaliers, changed sides and fought at Worcester for the parliament.
The Protector summoned him in 1657 to his House of Lords, but he
was imprisoned in 1659 on suspicion of a share in Booth&rsquo;s insurrection
and, after the Restoration, was created, in 1661, earl of
Carlisle, Viscount Morpeth and Lord Dacre of Gilsland, titles which
are still held by his descendants. From Sir Francis Howard, a
cavalier colonel and a younger son of &ldquo;bauld Willie,&rdquo; come the
Howards of Corby Castle in Cumberland, a branch without a hereditary
title.

William Howard, Viscount Stafford, was the fifth son of Thomas,
earl of Arundel, and grandson of Philip the prisoner. Marrying
the sister and heir of the fifth Lord Stafford, who died in 1637, he
and his wife were created Baron and Baroness Stafford by a patent
of 1640, with remainder, in default of heirs male, to heirs female.
A grant of the precedence enjoyed by the bride&rsquo;s father being held
illegal, her husband was in the same year created Viscount Stafford.
Roger Stafford, the impoverished heir male of the ancient Staffords,
had been forced to surrender his barony to the king by a deed dated
in the preceding year, a piece of injustice which is in the teeth of all
modern conceptions of peerage law. The Viscount Stafford was one
of the &ldquo;five Popish lords&rdquo; committed to the Tower in 1678 as a
result of the slanders of Titus Oates and he died by the axe in 1680
upon testimony which, as the diarist Evelyn protested, &ldquo;should not
be taken against the life of a dog.&rdquo; But three earls of his own
house&mdash;Carlisle, Suffolk and Berkshire&mdash;and the Lord Howard of
Escrick, an ex-trooper of Cromwell&rsquo;s guard and an anabaptist
sectary, gave their votes against him, his nephew Mowbray being
the only peer of his name in the minority for acquittal. In 1688 his
widow was created countess of Stafford for life, and his eldest son,
Henry, had the earldom of Stafford, with special remainder to his
brothers. This earldom ended in 1762, but the attainder was
reversed by an act of 1824 and in the following year Sir George
Jerningham, the heir general, established his claim to the Stafford
barony of 1640.

HOWARD, CATHERINE (d. 1542), the fifth queen of Henry
VIII., was a daughter of Lord Edmund Howard and a granddaughter
of Thomas Howard, 2nd duke of Norfolk (d. 1524).
Her father was very poor, and Catherine lived mainly with
Agnes, widow of the 2nd duke of Norfolk, meeting the king
at the house of Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester. Henry
was evidently charmed by her; the Roman Catholic party,
who disliked the marriage with Anne of Cleves, encouraged
his attentions; and after Anne&rsquo;s divorce he was privately
married to Catherine at Oatlands in July 1540. Soon afterwards
she was publicly acknowledged as queen. Before her marriage
Catherine had had several lovers, among them being a musician,
Henry Mannock, or Manox; her cousin, Thomas Culpepper;
and Francis Dereham, to whom she had certainly been betrothed.
After becoming queen she occasionally met Dereham and
Culpepper, and in November 1541 Archbishop Cranmer informed
Henry that his queen&rsquo;s past life had not been stainless. Cranmer
had obtained his knowledge indirectly from an old servant of the
duchess of Norfolk. Dereham confessed to his relations with
Catherine, and after some denials the queen herself admitted
that this was true; but denied that she had ever been betrothed
to Dereham, or that she had misconducted herself since her
marriage. Dereham and Culpepper were executed in December
1541 and their accomplices were punished, but Catherine was
released from prison. Some fresh information, however, very
soon came to light showing that she had been unchaste since
her marriage; a bill of attainder was passed through parliament,
and on the 13th of February 1542 the queen was beheaded.


See A. Strickland, Lives of the Queens of England (vol. iii. 1877).




HOWARD, JOHN (1726-1790), English philanthropist and
prison reformer, was born at Hackney, probably on the 2nd of
September 1726. His childhood was passed at Cardington,
near Bedford, where his father, a retired merchant of independent
means, had a small estate. He was apprenticed to a firm of
grocers in the city of London, but on the death of his father in
1742, by which he inherited considerable property, he bought
up his indenture, and devoted more than a year to foreign travel.
Never constitutionally strong, he became, on his return to
England, a confirmed invalid. Having been nursed through an
acute illness by an attentive landlady, a widow of some fifty-three
years of age, Howard, in return for her kindness, offered
her marriage and they were united in 1752. Becoming a widower
in less than three years, he determined to go abroad again,
Portugal being his destination. The ship, however, in which
he sailed was taken by a French privateer, the crew and passengers
being carried to Brest, where they were treated with great
severity. Howard was permitted to return to England on
parole to negotiate an exchange, which he accomplished, as
well as successfully representing the case of his fellow-captives.
He now settled down on his Cardington property, interesting
himself in meteorological observations. He was admitted a
member of the Royal Society in 1756. In 1758 he married
Henrietta, daughter of Edward Leeds, of Croxton, Cambridgeshire.
He continued to lead a secluded life at Cardington and
at Watcombe, Hampshire, busying himself in the construction
of model cottages and the erection of schools. In 1765 his
second wife died after giving birth to a son. In the following
year Howard went for a prolonged foreign tour, from which he
returned in 1770.

In 1773 the characteristic work of his life may be said to
have begun by his acceptance of the office of high sheriff of
Bedford. When the assizes were held he did not content himself
with sitting out the trials in open court, his inquisitiveness and his
benevolence alike impelled him to visit the gaol. Howard found
it, like all the prisons of the time, wretchedly defective in its
arrangements; but what chiefly shocked him was the circumstance
that neither the gaoler nor his subordinates were salaried
officers, but were dependent for their livelihood on fees from
the prisoners. He found that some whom the juries had declared
not guilty, others in whom the grand jury had not found even
such appearance of guilt as would warrant a trial, others whose
prosecutors had failed to appear, were frequently detained in
prison for months after they had ceased to be in the position
of accused parties, until they should have paid the fees of gaol
delivery (see Introduction to The State of the Prisons of England
and Wales). His prompt application to the justices of the
county for a salary to the gaoler in lieu of his fees was met by a
demand for a precedent in charging the county with an expense.
This he undertook to find if such a thing existed. He went
accordingly from county to county, and though he could find
no precedent for charging the county with the wages of its
servants he did find so many abuses in prison management
that he determined to devote himself to their reform.

In 1774 he gave evidence before a committee of the House
of Commons, and received the thanks of the house for &ldquo;the
humanity and zeal which have led him to visit the several gaols
833
of this kingdom, and to communicate to the House the interesting
observations which he has made on that subject.&rdquo; Almost
immediately an act was passed which provided for the liberation,
free of all charges, of every prisoner against whom the grand
jury failed to find a true bill, giving the gaoler a sum from the
county rate in lieu of the abolished fees. This was followed in
June by another requiring justices of the peace to see that the
walls and ceilings of all prisons within their jurisdiction were
scraped and whitewashed once a year at least; that the rooms
were regularly cleaned and ventilated; that infirmaries were
provided for the sick, and proper care taken to get them medical
advice; that the naked should be clothed; that underground
dungeons should be used as little as could be; and generally
that such courses should be taken as would tend to restore and
preserve the health of the prisoners. It was highly characteristic
of the man that, having caused the provisions of the new legislation
to be printed at his own private cost in large type, he sent
a copy to every gaoler and warder in the kingdom, that no one
should be able to plead ignorance of the law if detected in the
violation of its provisions. He then set out upon a new tour of
inspection, from which, however, he was brought home by the
approach of a general election in September 1774. Standing
as one of the anti-ministerial candidates for Bedford, he was
returned by a narrow majority but was unseated after a
scrutiny.

After a tour in Scotland and Ireland, he set out in April 1775
upon an extended tour through France, the Low Countries
and Germany. At Paris he was at first denied access to the
prisons; but, by recourse to an old and almost obsolete law of
1717, according to which any person wishing to distribute alms
to the prisoners was to be admitted, he succeeded in inspecting
the Bicêtre, the Force l&rsquo;Évêque and most of the other places
of confinement, the only important exception being the Bastille.
Even in that case he succeeded in obtaining possession of a
suppressed pamphlet, which he afterwards translated and
published in English, to the unconcealed chagrin of the French
authorities. At Ghent he examined with special interest the
great Maison de Force, then recently erected, with its distinctive
features&mdash;useful labour, in the profits of which the prisoners
had a share, and complete separation of the inmates by night.
At Amsterdam, as in Holland generally, he was much struck
with the comparative absence of crime, a phenomenon which
he attributed to the industrial and reformatory treatment there
adopted. In Germany he found little that was useful and much
that was repulsive; in Hanover and Osnabrück, under the rule
of a British sovereign, he even found traces of torture. After
a short tour in England (Nov. 1775 to May 1776), he again
went abroad, extending his tour to several of the Swiss cantons.
In 1777 appeared The State of the Prisons in England and Wales,
with Preliminary Observations, and an Account of some Foreign
Prisons. One of the immediate results was the drafting a bill
for the establishment of penitentiary houses, where by means
of solitary imprisonment, accompanied by well-regulated
labour and religious instruction, the object of reforming the
criminal and inuring him to habits of industry might be pursued.
New buildings were manifestly necessary; and Howard volunteered
to go abroad again and collect plans. He first went
to Amsterdam (April 1778), and carefully examined the &ldquo;spin-houses&rdquo;
and &ldquo;rasp-houses&rdquo;1 for which that city was famous;
next he traversed Prussia, Saxony, Bohemia, Austria and Italy,
everywhere inspecting prisons, hospitals and workhouses, and
carefully recording the merits and defects of each. The information
he thus obtained having been placed at the service of
parliament, a bill was passed for building two penitentiary
houses, and Howard was appointed first supervisor, but he
resigned the post before anything practical had been achieved.
In 1780 he had published a quarto volume as an appendix (the
first) to his State of Prisons; about the same time also he
caused to be printed his translation of the suppressed French
pamphlet on the Bastille; but on obtaining release from his
employments at home his passion for accumulating statistics
urged him to new and more extended continental tours, as far
as to Denmark, Sweden and Russia in 1781, and to Spain and
Portugal in 1783. The results of these journeys were embodied
in 1784 in a second appendix, with the publication of which his
direct labours in connexion with the subject of prison reform
may be said to have ceased.

The five remaining years of his life were chiefly devoted to
researches on the means for prevention of the plague, and for
guarding against the propagation of contagious distempers
in general. After an extended tour on the continent his researches
seemed to be complete; and with a great accumulation of papers
and memoranda, he was preparing to return homewards from
Constantinople by Vienna, when it occurred to his scrupulous
mind that he still lacked any personal experience of quarantine
discipline. He returned to Smyrna, and, deliberately choosing
a foul ship, took a passage to Venice. A protracted voyage
of sixty days, during which an attack by pirates gave Howard
an opportunity of manifesting his personal bravery, was followed
by a weary term of confinement which enabled him to gain the
experience he had desired. While imprisoned in the Venetian
lazaretto he received the information that his only son, a youth
of twenty-two years of age, had lost his reason and had been
put under restraint. Returning hastily by Trieste and Vienna
(where he had a long and singular interview with the emperor
Joseph II.), he reached England in February 1787. His first
care related to his domestic concerns; he then set out upon
another journey of inspection of the prisons of the United
Kingdom, at the same time busying himself in preparing for
the press the results of his recent tour. The somewhat rambling
work containing them was published in 1798 at Warrington,
under the title An Account of the Principal Lazarettos in Europe:
with various Papers relative to the Plague, together with further
Observations on some Foreign Prisons and Hospitals, and additional
Remarks on the present State of those in Great Britain and
Ireland.

In July 1789 he embarked on what proved to be his last
journey. Travelling overland to St Petersburg and Moscow,
and so southwards, and visiting the principal military hospitals
that lay on his route, he reached Kherson in November. In the
hospitals of this place and of the immediate neighbourhood he
found more than enough to occupy his attention while he awaited
the means of transit to Constantinople. Towards the end of the
year his medical advice was asked in the case of a young lady who
was suffering under the camp fever then prevalent, and in
attending her he himself took the disease, which terminated
fatally on the 20th of January 1790. He was buried near the
village of Dauphigny on the road to St Nicholas. There is a
statue by Bacon to his memory in St Paul&rsquo;s, London, and one at
Bedford by A. Gilbert. In personal appearance Howard is
described as having been short, thin and sallow&mdash;unprepossessing
apart from the attraction of a penetrating eye and a
benevolent smile.

HOWARD, OLIVER OTIS (1830-1909), American soldier, was
born in Leeds, Maine, on the 8th of November 1830. He graduated
at Bowdoin College in 1850, and at the U.S. Military
Academy in 1854. In 1857 he served in Florida against the
Seminole Indians, and from 1857 to 1861 he was assistant
professor of mathematics at West Point. At the beginning of the
Civil War he resigned to become colonel of the 3rd Maine volunteer
regiment, and at the first battle of Bull Run was in command
of a brigade. In September he was promoted brigadier-general
of volunteers. He served in the Peninsular Campaign, and at
the battle of Seven Pines (Fair Oaks) he was twice wounded,
losing his right arm. On his return to active service in August
1862 he took part in the Virginian campaigns of 1862-63; at
834
Antietam he succeeded Sedgwick in command of a division, and
he became major-general of volunteers in March 1863. In the
campaign of Chancellorsville (see Wilderness) he commanded the
XI. corps, which was routed by &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson, and in the
first day&rsquo;s battle at Gettysburg he was for some hours (succeeding
Doubleday after Reynolds&rsquo;s death) in command of the Union
troops. The XI. corps was transferred to Tennessee after
Rosecrans&rsquo;s defeat at Chickamauga, and formed part of Hooker&rsquo;s
command in the great victory of Chattanooga. When Sherman
prepared to invade Georgia in the spring of 1864 the XI. corps was
merged with the XII. into the new XX., commanded by Hooker,
and Howard was then placed, in command of the new IV. corps,
which he led in all the actions of the Atlanta campaign, receiving
another wound at Pickett&rsquo;s Mills. On the death in action of
General M&rsquo;Pherson, Howard, in July 1864, was selected to command
the Army of the Tennessee. In this position he took part
in the &ldquo;March to the Sea&rdquo; and the Carolinas campaign. In
March 1865 he was breveted major-general U.S.A. &ldquo;for gallant
and meritorious service in the battle of Ezra Church and during
the campaign against Atlanta,&rdquo; and in 1893 received a Congressional
medal of honour for bravery at Fair Oaks. After the
peace he served as commissioner of the Bureau of Refugees,
Freedmen and Abandoned Lands from 1865 until 1874; in 1872
he was special commissioner to the hostile Apaches of New
Mexico and Arizona; in 1874-1881 was in command of the
Department of the Columbia and conducted the campaign
against Chief Joseph in 1877 and that against the Bannocks and
Piutes in 1878. In 1881-1882 he was superintendent of West
Point; and in 1882-1886 he commanded the Department of
the Platte, in 1886-1888 the Department of the Pacific, and in
1888-1894 the Department of the East. In 1886 he was promoted
major-general and in 1894 he retired. He died at
Burlington, Vermont, on the 26th of October 1909.

Howard was deeply interested, in the welfare of the negroes;
and the establishment by the U.S. Government in 1867
of Howard University, at Washington, especially for their
education, was largely due to him; it was named in his
honour, and from 1869 to 1873 he presided over it. In 1895
he founded for the education of the &ldquo;mountain whites&rdquo; the
Lincoln Memorial University at Cumberland Gap, Tenn. (see
Cumberland Mountains), and became president of its board.
He held honorary degrees of various universities, and was a
chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He wrote, amongst other
works, Donald&rsquo;s Schooldays (1877); Chief Joseph (1881); a life
of General Zachary Taylor (1892) in the &ldquo;Great Commanders&rdquo;
series; Isabella of Castile (1894); Fighting for Humanity
(1898); Henry in the War (1898); papers in the &ldquo;Battles and
Leaders&rdquo; collection on the Atlanta campaign; My Life and
Experience among our Hostile Indians (1907); and Autobiography
of O. O. Howard (2 vols., New York, 1907).



HOWARD, SIR ROBERT (1626-1698), English dramatist,
sixth son of Thomas Howard, 1st earl of Berkshire, was born in
1626. He was knighted at the second battle of Newbury (1644)
for his signal courage on the Royalist side. Imprisoned in
Windsor Castle under the Commonwealth, his loyalty was
rewarded at the Restoration, and he eventually became auditor
of the exchequer. His best play is a comedy, The Committee, or
the Faithful Irishman (1663; printed 1665), which kept the stage,
long after its interest as a political satire was exhausted, for the
character of Teague, said to have been drawn from one of his own
servants. He was an early patron of Dryden, who married his
sister, Lady Elizabeth Howard, and in the Indian Queen, a
tragedy in heroic verse (1664; pr. 1665) Howard had assistance
from Dryden, although the fact was not made public until the
production of Dryden&rsquo;s Indian Emperor. The magnificence of
the spectacle, and the novelty of the costume of feathers, presented
by Mrs. Aphra Behn, that was worn by Zempoalla, the
Indian queen, made a great sensation. The scenery and accessories
were unusually brilliant, the richest ever seen in England,
according to Evelyn. In 1665 Howard published Foure New
Plays, in the preface to which he opposed the view maintained
by Dryden in the dedicatory epistle to The Rival Ladies, that
rhyme was better suited to the heroic tragedy than blank verse.
Howard made an exception in favour of the rhyme of Lord
Orrery, but by his silence concerning Dryden implicated him in
the general censure. Dryden answered by placing Howard&rsquo;s
sentiments in the mouth of Crites in his own Essay on Dramatic
Poesy (1668). The controversy did not end here, but Dryden
completely worsted his adversary in the 1668 edition of The
Indian Emperor. Howard died on the 3rd of September 1698.

His brother, James Howard, wrote two comedies, All Mistaken,
or the Mad Couple, a comedy (1667; pr. 1672), and The English
Mounsieur (1666; pr. 1674), the success of which seems to have
been partly due to the acting of Nell Gwynn.



HOWARD, LORD WILLIAM (1563-1640), known as &ldquo;Belted,
or Bauld (bold) Will,&rdquo; 3rd son of Thomas Howard, 4th duke of
Norfolk (executed in 1572), and of his second wife Margaret,
daughter of Lord Audley, was born at Audley End in Essex
on the 19th of December 1563. He married on the 28th of
October 1577 Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas, Lord Dacre, and
proceeded subsequently to the University of Cambridge. Being
suspected of treasonable intentions together with his elder
brother, Philip, earl of Arundel, he was imprisoned in 1583,
1585 and 1589. He joined the church of Rome in 1584, both
brothers being dispossessed by the queen of a portion of their
Dacre estates, which were, however, restored in 1601 for a payment
of £10,000. Howard then took up his residence with his
children and grandchildren at Naworth Castle in Cumberland,
restored the castle, improved the estate and established order
in that part of the country. In 1603, on the accession of James,
he had been restored in blood. In 1618 he was made one of the
commissioners for the border, and performed great services
in upholding the law and suppressing marauders. Lord William
was a learned and accomplished scholar, praised by Camden,
to whom he sent inscriptions and drawings from relics collected
by him from the Roman wall, as &ldquo;a singular lover of valuable
antiquity and learned withal.&rdquo; He collected a valuable library,
of which most of the printed works remain still at Naworth,
though the MSS. have been dispersed, a portion being now in
the Arundel MSS. in the Royal College of Arms; he corresponded
with Ussher and was intimate with Camden, Spelman, and
Cotton, whose eldest son married his daughter. He published,
in 1592 an edition of Florence of Worcester&rsquo;s Chronicon ex
Chronicis, dedicated to Lord Burghley, and drew up a genealogy
of his family, now among the duke of Norfolk&rsquo;s MSS. at Norfolk
House. He died in October 1640 at Greystock, to which place
he had been removed when failing in health to escape the Scots
who were threatening an advance on Naworth. He had a large
family of children, of whom Philip, his heir, was the grandfather
of Charles, 1st earl of Carlisle, and Francis was the ancestor of
the Howards of Corby.



HOWARD OF EFFINGHAM, WILLIAM HOWARD, 1st
Baron (c. 1510-1573), English lord high admiral, was the son
of the 2nd duke of Norfolk. He was popular with Henry VIII.,
and at Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s coronation was deputy earl marshal;
and he was sent on missions to Scotland and France; but in
1541 he was charged with abetting his relative Queen Catherine
Howard, and was convicted of misprision of treason, but pardoned.
In 1552 he was made governor of Calais, and in 1553 lord high
admiral, being created Baron Howard of Effingham in 1554
for his defence of London in Sir Thomas Wyat&rsquo;s rebellion against
Queen Mary. He befriended the princess Elizabeth, but his
popularity with the navy saved him from Mary&rsquo;s resentment;
and when Elizabeth became queen he had great influence with
her and filled several important posts. His son, the second
baron, who is famous in English naval history, was created earl
of Nottingham (q.v.); and from a younger son the later earls
of Effingham were descended. William&rsquo;s descendant, Francis
(d. 1695), inherited the barony of Howard of Effingham on the
death of his cousin, Charles, in 1681; and Francis&rsquo;s son, Francis
(1683-1743), was created earl of Effingham in 1731. This earldom
became extinct on the death of Richard, the fourth holder, in
1816; but it was created again in 1837 in favour of Kenneth
Alexander (1767-1845), another of William Howard&rsquo;s descendants,
835
who had succeeded to the barony of Howard of Effingham in
1816.



HOWE, ELIAS (1819-1867), American sewing-machine
inventor, was born in Spencer, Massachusetts, on the 9th of July
1819. His early years were spent on his father&rsquo;s farm. In 1835
he entered the factory of a manufacturer of cotton-machinery
at Lowell, Massachusetts, where he learned the machinist&rsquo;s
trade. Subsequently, while employed in a machine shop at
Cambridge, Mass., he conceived the idea of a sewing machine,
and for five years spent all his spare time in its development.
In September 1846 a patent for a practical sewing machine was
granted to him; and Howe spent the following two years
(1847-1849) in London, employed by William Thomas, a corset
manufacturer, to whom he had sold the English rights for £250.
Years of disappointment and discouragement followed before
he was successful in introducing his invention, and several
imitations which infringed his patent, particularly that of Isaac
Merritt Singer (1811-1875), had already been successfully
introduced and were widely used. His rights were established
after much litigation in 1854, and by the date of expiration
of his patent (1867) he had realized something over $2,000,000
out of his invention. He died in Brooklyn, New York, on the
3rd of October 1867.

Inventor (Detroit, 1867); P. G. Hubert, Jr., Inventors, in &ldquo;Men of
Achievement&rdquo; series (New York, 1893).




HOWE, JOHN (1630-1706), English Puritan divine, was born
on the 17th of May 1630 at Loughborough, Leicestershire,
where his father was vicar. On the 19th of May 1647 he entered
Christ&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, as a sizar, and in the following
year took his degree of B.A. During his residence at the university
he made the acquaintance of Ralph Cudworth, Henry
More and John Smith, from intercourse with whom, as well
as from direct acquaintance with the Dialogues themselves,
his mind received that &ldquo;Platonic tinge&rdquo; so perceptible in
his writings. Immediately after graduation at Cambridge, he
migrated to Oxford, where he became fellow and chaplain of
Magdalen College, proceeding M.A. in 1652. He was then
ordained by Charles Herle (1598-1659), the Puritan rector of
Winwick, and in 1654 went as perpetual curate to Great Torrington
in Devon, where he preached the discourses which later
took shape in his treatises on The Blessedness of the Righteous
and on Delighting in God. In the beginning of 1657 a journey
to London accidentally brought Howe under the notice of
Cromwell, who made him his domestic chaplain. In this position
his conduct was such as to win the praise of even the bitterest
enemies of his party. Without overlooking his fellow-Puritans,
he was always ready to help pious and learned men of other
schools. Seth Ward (afterwards bishop of Exeter) and Thomas
Fuller were among those who profited by Howe&rsquo;s kindness, and
were not ashamed subsequently to express their gratitude for
it. On the resignation of Richard Cromwell, Howe returned to
Great Torrington, to leave it again in 1662 on the passing of
the Act of Uniformity. For several years he led a wandering
and uncertain life, preaching in secret as occasion offered to
handfuls of trusted hearers. Being in straits he published in
1668 The Blessedness of the Righteous; the reputation which
he thus acquired procured him an invitation from Lord
Massereene, of Antrim Castle, Ireland, with whom he lived for
five or six years as domestic chaplain, frequently preaching in
public, with the approval of the bishop of the diocese. Here
too he produced the most eloquent of his shorter treatises,
The Vanity of Man as Mortal, and On Delighting in God, and
planned his best work, The Living Temple. In the beginning of
1676 he accepted an invitation to become joint-pastor of a nonconformist
congregation at Haberdashers&rsquo; Hall, London; and
in the same year he published the first part of The Living Temple
entitled Concerning God&rsquo;s Existence and his Conversableness with
Man: Against Atheism or the Epicurean Deism. In 1677
appeared his tractate On the Reconcileableness of God&rsquo;s Prescience
of the Sins of Men with the Wisdom and Sincerity of His Counsels,
Exhortations and whatsoever means He uses to prevent them,
which was attacked from various quarters, and had Andrew
Marvell for one of its defenders. On Thoughtfulness for the Morrow
followed in 1681; Self-Dedication and Union among Protestants
in 1682, and The Redeemer&rsquo;s Tears wept over Lost Souls in 1684.

For five years after his settlement in London Howe enjoyed
comparative freedom, and was on not unfriendly terms with
many eminent Anglicans, such as Stillingfleet, Tillotson, John
Sharp and Richard Kidder; but the greater severity which
began to be exercised towards nonconformists in 1681 so interfered
with his liberty that in 1685 he gladly accepted the invitation
of Philip, Lord Wharton, to travel abroad with him. In
1686 he determined to settle for a time at Utrecht, where he
officiated in the English chapel. Among his friends there was
Gilbert Burnet, by whose influence he obtained several confidential
interviews with William of Orange. In 1687 Howe
availed himself of the declaration for liberty of conscience to
return to England, and in the following year he headed the
deputation of nonconformist ministers who went to congratulate
William on his accession to the English throne. The remainder
of his life was uneventful. His influence was always on the side
of mutual forbearance, between conformists and dissenters
in 1689, and between Congregationalists and Presbyterians
in 1690. In 1693 he published three discourses On the Carnality
of Religious Contention, suggested by the disputes that became
rife among nonconformists as soon as liberty of doctrine and
worship had been granted. In 1694 and 1695 he published
various treatises on the subject of the Trinity, the principal
being A Calm and Solemn Inquiry concerning the Possibility
of a Trinity in the Godhead. The second part of The Living
Temple, entitled Animadversions on Spinosa and a French
Writer pretending to confute him, with a recapitulation of the
former part and an account of the destitution and restitution of
God&rsquo;s Temple among Men, appeared in 1702. In 1701 he had
some controversy with Daniel Defoe on the question of occasional
conformity. In 1705 he published a discourse On Patience
in the Expectation of Future Blessedness, but his health had begun
to fail, and he died in London on the 2nd of April 1706.
Richard Cromwell visited him in his last illness.

Though excelled by Baxter as a pulpit orator, and by Owen
in exegetical ingenuity and in almost every department of
theological learning, Howe compares favourably with either as
a sagacious and profound thinker, while he was much more
successful in combining religious earnestness and fervour of
conviction with large-hearted tolerance and cultured breadth
of view. He was a man of high principle and fine presence,
and it was said of him &ldquo;that he never made an enemy and never
lost a friend.&rdquo;


The works published in his lifetime, including a number of sermons,
were collected into 2 vols. fol. in 1724, and again reprinted in 3
vols. 8vo. in 1848. A complete edition of the Whole Works, including
much posthumous and additional matter, appeared with a memoir
in 8 vols, in 1822; this was reprinted in 1 vol. in 1838 and in 6 vols.
in 1862-1863. E. Calamy&rsquo;s Life (1724) forms the basis of The
Life and Character of Howe, with an Analysis of his Writings, by
Henry Rogers (1836, new ed. 1863). See also a sketch by R. F.
Horton (1896).




HOWE, JOSEPH (1804-1873), Canadian statesman, was born
at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the 13th of December 1804, the son
of John Howe (1752-1835), a United Empire Loyalist who was
for many years king&rsquo;s printer and postmaster-general for the
Maritime Provinces and the Bermudas. He received little
regular education, and at the age of 13 entered his father&rsquo;s office.
In 1827 he started the Acadian, a weekly non-political journal,
but soon sold it, and in 1828 purchased the Nova Scotian, which
later became amalgamated with the Morning Chronicle. From
this date he devoted increasing attention to political affairs, and
in 1835 was prosecuted for libelling the magistrates of Halifax.
Being unable to find a lawyer willing to undertake his case, he
pleaded it himself, and won his acquittal by a speech of over six
hours, which secured for Nova Scotia the freedom of the press
and for himself the reputation of an orator. In 1836 he was
elected member for Halifax in the provincial assembly, and
during the next twelve years devoted himself to attaining
836
responsible government for Nova Scotia. This brought him into
fierce conflict with the reigning oligarchy and with the lieutenant-governor,
Lord Falkland (1803-1884), whom he forced to resign.
Largely owing to Howe&rsquo;s statesmanship responsible government
was finally conceded in 1848 by the imperial authorities, and
was thus gained without the bloodshed and confusion which
marked its acquisition in Ontario and Quebec. In 1850 he was
appointed a delegate to England on behalf of the Intercolonial
railway, for which he obtained a large imperial guarantee.
In 1854 he resigned from the cabinet, and was appointed chief
commissioner of railways. In 1855 he was sent by the imperial
government to the United States in connexion with the Foreign
Enlistment Act, to raise soldiers for the war in the Crimea.
Through the rashness of others he got into difficulties, and was
attacked in the British House of Commons by Mr Gladstone,
whom he compelled to apologize.

In 1855 he was defeated by Mr (afterwards Sir Charles)
Tupper, but was elected by acclamation in the next year in Hants
county, and was from 1860 to 1863 premier of Nova Scotia. In the
latter years he was appointed by the imperial government fishery
commissioner to the United States, and thus took no part in the
negotiations for confederation. Though his eloquence had done
more than anything else to make practicable a union of the
British North American provinces, he opposed confederation,
largely owing to wounded vanity; but on finding it impossible
to obtain from the imperial authorities the repeal of the British
North America Act, he refused to join his associates in the
extreme measures which were advocated, and on the promise
from the Canadian government of better financial terms to his
native province, entered (on the 30th of January 1869) the
cabinet of Sir John Macdonald as president of the council.
This brought upon him a storm of obloquy, under which his
health gradually gave way. In May 1873 he was appointed
lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia, but died suddenly on the
1st of June of the same year.

Howe&rsquo;s eloquence, and still more his unfailing wit and high
spirits, made him for many years the idol of his province. He
is the finest orator whom Canada has produced, and also wrote
poetry, which shows in places high merit. Many of his sayings
are still current in Nova Scotia. In 1904 a statue in his honour
was erected in Halifax.


His Letters and Speeches were published in 1858 in Boston, Mass.,
in 2 vols., edited nominally by William Annand, really by himself.
See also Public Letters and Speeches of Joseph Howe (Halifax,
1909). The Life and Times by G. E. Fenety (1896) is poor. The
Life by the Hon. James W. Longley (Toronto, 1904) is dispassionate,
but otherwise mediocre. Joseph Howe, by George Monro Grant
(reprinted Halifax, 1904), is a brilliant sketch.

HOWE, JULIA WARD (1819-1910), American author and
reformer, was born in New York City on the 27th of May 1819.
Her father, Samuel Ward, was a banker; her mother, Julia
Rush [Cutler] (1796-1824), a poet of some ability. When only
sixteen years old she had begun to contribute poems to New
York periodicals. In 1843 she married Dr Samuel Gridley
Howe (q.v.), with whom she spent the next year in England,
France, Germany and Italy. She assisted Dr Howe in editing
the Commonwealth in 1851-1853. The results of her study of
German philosophy were seen in philosophical essays; in
lectures on &ldquo;Doubt and Belief,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Duality of Character,&rdquo;
&amp;c., delivered in 1860-1861 in her home in Boston, and later in
Washington; and in addresses before the Boston Radical Club
and the Concord school of philosophy. Samuel Longfellow,
his brother Henry, Wendell Phillips, W. L. Garrison, Charles
Sumner, Theodore Parker and James Freeman Clarke were
among her friends; she advocated abolition, and preached
occasionally from Unitarian pulpits. She was one of the
organizers of the American Woman-Suffrage Association and of
the Association for the Advancement of Women (1869), and in
1870 became one of the editors of the Woman&rsquo;s Journal, and
in 1872 president of the New England Women&rsquo;s Club. In the
same year she was a delegate to the Prison Reform Congress in
London, and founded there the Woman&rsquo;s Peace Association,
one of the many ways in which she expressed her opposition
to war. She wrote The World&rsquo;s Own (unsuccessfully played at
Wallack&rsquo;s, New York, in 1855, published 1857), and in 1858, for
Edwin Booth, Hippolytus, never acted or published. Her lyric
poetry, thanks to her temperament, and possibly to her musical
training, was her highest literary form: she published Passion
Flowers (anonymously, 1854), Words for the Hour (1856), Later
Lyrics (1866), and From Sunset Ridge: Poems Old and New
(1898); her most popular poem is The Battle Hymn of the
Republic, written to the old folk-tune associated with the song
of &ldquo;John Brown&rsquo;s Body,&rdquo; when Mrs Howe was at the front
in 1861, and published (Feb. 1862) in the Atlantic Monthly, to
which she frequently contributed. She edited Sex and Education
(1874), an answer to Sex in Education (1873) by Edward Hammond
Clarke (1820-1877); and wrote several books of travel,
Modern Society (1880) and Is Polite Society Polite? (1895),
collections of addresses, each taking its title from a lecture criticizing
the shallowness and falseness of society, the power of
money, &amp;c., A Memoir of Dr Samuel G. Howe (1876), Life of
Margaret Fuller (1883), in the &ldquo;Famous Women&rdquo; series.
Sketches of Representative Women of New England (1905) and
her own Reminiscences (Boston, 1899). Her children were: Julia
Romana Anagnos (1844-1886), who, like her mother, wrote
verse and studied philosophy, and who taught in the Perkins
Institution, in the charge of which her husband, Michael Anagnos
(1837-1906), whose family name had been Anagnostopoulos,
succeeded her father; Henry Marion Howe (b. 1848), the
eminent metallurgist, and professor in Columbia University;
Laura Elizabeth Richards (b. 1850), and Maud Howe Elliott
(b. 1855), wife of John Elliott, the painter of a fine ceiling in the
Boston library,&mdash;both these daughters being contributors to
literature. Mrs Howe died on the 17th of October 1910.



HOWE, RICHARD HOWE, Earl (1726-1799), British admiral,
was born in London on the 8th of March 1726. He was the
second son of Emmanuel Scrope Howe, 2nd Viscount Howe,
who died governor of Barbadoes in March 1735, and of Mary
Sophia Charlotte, a daughter of the baroness Kilmansegge,
afterwards countess of Darlington, the mistress of George I.&mdash;a
relationship which does much to explain his early rise in the
navy. Richard Howe entered the navy in the &ldquo;Severn,&rdquo; one
of the squadron sent into the south seas with Anson in 1740.
The &ldquo;Severn&rdquo; failed to round the Horn and returned home.
Howe next served in the West Indies in the &ldquo;Burford,&rdquo; and
was present in her when she was very severely damaged, in the
unsuccessful attack on La Guayra on the 18th of February 1742.
He was made acting-lieutenant in the West Indies in the same
year, and the rank was confirmed in 1744. During the Jacobite
rising of 1745 he commanded the &ldquo;Baltimore&rdquo; sloop in the
North Sea, and was dangerously wounded in the head while
co-operating with a frigate in an engagement with two strong
French privateers. In 1746 he became post-captain, and commanded
the &ldquo;Triton&rdquo; (24) in the West Indies. As captain of
the &ldquo;Cornwall&rdquo; (80), the flagship of Sir Charles Knowles, he
was in the battle with the Spaniards off Havana on the 2nd of
October 1748. While the peace between the War of the Austrian
Succession and the Seven Years&rsquo; War lasted, Howe held commands
at home and on the west coast of Africa. In 1755 he
went with Boscawen to North America as captain of the &ldquo;Dunkirk&rdquo;
(60), and his seizure of the French &ldquo;Alcide&rdquo; (64) was the
first shot fired in the war. From this date till the peace of 1763
he served in the Channel in various more or less futile expeditions
against the coast of France, with a steady increase of reputation
as a firm and skilful officer. On the 20th of November 1759
he led Hawke&rsquo;s fleet as captain of the &ldquo;Magnanime&rdquo; (64) in
the magnificent victory of Quiberon.

By the death of his elder brother, killed near Ticonderoga on the
6th of July 1758, he became Viscount Howe&mdash;an Irish peerage.
In 1762 he was elected M.P. for Dartmouth, and held the seat
till he received a title of Great Britain. During 1763 and 1765
he was a member of the Admiralty board, and from 1765 to
1770 was treasurer of the navy. In that year he was promoted
rear-admiral, and in 1775 vice-admiral. In 1776 he was appointed
to the command of the North American station. The rebellion
837
of the colonies was making rapid progress, and Howe was known
to be in sympathy with the colonists. He had sought the
acquaintance of Benjamin Franklin, who was a friend of his
sister Miss Howe, a clever eccentric woman well known in
London society, and had already tried to act as a peacemaker.
It was doubtless because of his known sentiments that he was
selected to command in America, and was joined in commission
with his brother Sir William Howe, the general at the head of the
land forces, to make a conciliatory arrangement. A committee
appointed by the Continental Congress conferred with the Howes
in September 1776 but nothing was accomplished. The appointment
of a new peace commission in 1778 offended the admiral
deeply, and he sent in a resignation of his command. It was
reluctantly accepted by Lord Sandwich, then First Lord, but
before it could take effect France declared war, and a powerful
French squadron was sent to America under the count d&rsquo;Estaing.
Being greatly outnumbered, Howe had to stand on the defensive,
but he baffled the French admiral at Sandy Hook, and defeated
his attempt to take Newport in Rhode Island by a fine combination
of caution and calculated daring. On the arrival of Admiral
John Byron from England with reinforcements, Howe left the
station in September. Until the fall of Lord North&rsquo;s ministry
in 1782 he refused to serve, assigning as his reason that he could
not trust Lord Sandwich. He considered that he had not been
properly supported in America, and was embittered both by
the supersession of himself and his brother as peace commissioners,
and by attacks made on him by the ministerial writers
in the press.

On the change of ministry in March 1782 he was selected to
command in the Channel, and in the autumn of that year,
September, October and November, he carried out the final
relief of Gibraltar. It was a difficult operation, for the French
and Spaniards had in all 46 line-of-battle ships to his 33, and in
the exhausted state of the country it was impossible to fit his
ships properly or to supply them with good crews. He was,
moreover, hampered by a great convoy carrying stores. But
Howe was eminent in the handling of a great multitude of ships,
the enemy was awkward and unenterprising, and the operation
was brilliantly carried out. From the 28th of January to the
16th of April 1783 he was First Lord of the Admiralty, and he
held that post from December 1783 till August 1788, in Pitt&rsquo;s
first ministry. The task was no pleasant one, for he had to
agree to economies where he considered that more outlay was
needed, and he had to disappoint the hopes of the many officers
who were left unemployed by the peace. On the outbreak
of the Revolutionary war in 1793 he was again named to the
command of the Channel fleet. His services in 1794 form the
most glorious period of his life, for in it he won the epoch-making
victory of the 1st of June (see First of June, Battle of).
Though Howe was now nearly seventy, and had been trained
in the old school, he displayed an originality not usual with
veterans, and not excelled by any of his successors in the war,
not even by Nelson, since they had his example to follow and
were served by more highly trained squadrons than his. He
continued to hold the nominal command by the wish of the
king, but his active service was now over. In 1797 he was
called on to pacify the mutineers at Spithead, and his great
influence with the seamen who trusted him was conspicuously
shown. He died on the 5th of August 1799, and was buried in
his family vault at Langar. His monument by Flaxman is in
St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. In 1782 he was created Viscount Howe
of Langar, and in 1788 Baron and Earl Howe. In June 1797 he
was made a knight of the Garter. With the sailors he was
always popular, though he was no popularity hunter, for they
knew him to be just. His nickname of Black Dick was given
on account of his swarthy complexion, and the well-known
portrait by Gainsborough shows that it was apt.

Lord Howe married, on the 10th of March 1758, Mary Hartop,
the daughter of Colonel Chiverton Hartop of Welby in Leicestershire,
and had issue two daughters. His Irish title descended
to his brother William, the general, who died childless in 1814.
The earldom, and the viscounty of the United Kingdom, being
limited to heirs male, became extinct, but the barony, being
to heirs general, passed to his daughter, Sophia Charlotte
(1762-1835), who married the Hon. Penn Assheton Curzon.
Their son, Richard William Curzon (1796-1870), who succeeded
his paternal grandfather as Viscount Curzon in 1820, was
created Earl Howe in 1821; he was succeeded by his son, George
Augustus (1821-1876), and then by another son, Richard William
(1822-1900), whose son Richard George Penn Curzon-Howe
(b. 1861) became 4th Earl Howe in 1900.


The standard Life is by Sir John Barrow (1838). Interesting
reminiscences will be found in the Life of Codrington, by Lady
Bourchier. Accounts of his professional services are in Charnock&rsquo;s

HOWE, SAMUEL GRIDLEY (1801-1876), American philanthropist,
was born at Boston, Massachusetts, on the 10th of
November 1801. His father, Joseph N. Howe, was a ship-owner
and cordage manufacturer; and his mother, Patty Gridley, was
one of the most beautiful women of her day. Young Howe was
educated at Boston and at Brown University, Providence, and in
1821 began to study medicine in Boston. But fired by enthusiasm
for the Greek revolution and by Byron&rsquo;s example, he was no
sooner qualified and admitted to practice than he abandoned
these prospects and took ship for Greece, where he joined the
army and spent six years of hardship amid scenes of warfare.
Then, to raise funds for the cause, he returned to America;
his fervid appeals enabled him to collect about $60,000, which he
spent on provisions and clothing, and he established a relief depot
near Aegina, where he started works for the refugees, the existing
quay, or American Mole, being built in this way. He formed
another colony of exiles on the Isthmus of Corinth. He wrote
a History of the Greek Revolution, which was published in 1828,
and in 1831 he returned to America. Here a new object of
interest engaged him. Through his friend Dr John D. Fisher
(d. 1850), a Boston physician who had started a movement there
as early as 1826 for establishing a school for the blind, he had
learnt of the similar school founded in Paris by Valentin Haüy,
and it was proposed to Howe by a committee organized by
Fisher that he should direct the establishment of a &ldquo;New
England Asylum for the Blind&rdquo; at Boston. He took up the
project with characteristic ardour, and set out at once for Europe
to investigate the problem. There he was temporarily diverted
from his task by becoming mixed up with the Polish revolt, and,
in pursuit of a mission to carry American contributions across
the Prussian frontier, he was arrested and imprisoned at Berlin,
but was at last released through the intervention of the American
minister at Paris. Returning to Boston in July 1832, he began
receiving a few blind children at his father&rsquo;s house in Pleasant
Street, and thus sowed the seed which grew into the famous
Perkins Institution. In January 1833 the funds available
were all spent, but so much progress had been shown that the
legislature voted $6000, later increased to $30,000 a year, to
the institution on condition that it should educate gratuitously
twenty poor blind from the state; money was also contributed
from Salem, and from Boston, and Colonel Thomas H. Perkins,
a prominent Bostonian, presented his mansion and grounds
in Pearl Street for the school to be held there in perpetuity.
This building being later found unsuitable, Colonel Perkins
consented to its sale, and in 1839 the institution was moved to
South Boston, to a large building which had previously been an
hotel. It was henceforth known as the &ldquo;Perkins Institution
and Massachusetts Asylum (or, since 1877, School) for the Blind.&rdquo;
Howe was director, and the life and soul of the school; he
opened a printing-office and organized a fund for printing for
the blind&mdash;the first done in America; and he was unwearied
in calling public attention to the work. The Institution, through
him, became one of the intellectual centres of American philanthropy,
and by degrees obtained more and more financial
support. In 1837 Dr Howe went still further and brought
the famous blind deaf-mute, Laura Bridgman (q.v.) to the
school.

838

It must suffice here to chronicle the remaining more important
facts in Dr Howe&rsquo;s life, outside his regular work. In 1843 he
married Julia Ward (see above), daughter of a New York banker,
and they made a prolonged European trip, on which Dr Howe
spent much time in visiting those public institutions which
carried out the objects specially interesting to him. In Rome,
in 1844, his eldest daughter, Julia Romana (afterwards the wife
of Michael Anagnos, Dr Howe&rsquo;s assistant and successor), was
born, and in September the travellers returned to America, and
Dr Howe resumed his activities. In 1846 he became interested
in the condition and treatment of idiots, and particularly in the
experiments of Dr Guggenbühl on the cretins of Switzerland.
He became chairman of a state commission of inquiry into the
number and condition of idiots in Massachusetts, and the report
of this commission, presented in 1848, caused a profound sensation.
An appropriation of $2500 per annum was made for
training ten idiot children under Dr Howe&rsquo;s supervision, and by
degrees the value of his School for Idiotic and Feeble-minded
Youths, which, starting in South Boston, was in 1890 removed
to Waltham, was generally appreciated. It was the first of its
kind in the United States. An enthusiastic humanitarian on all
subjects, Dr Howe was an ardent abolitionist and a member of
the Free Soil party, and had played a leading part at Boston in
the movements which culminated in the Civil War. When it
broke out he was an active member of the sanitary commission.
In 1871 he was sent to Santo Domingo as a member of the
commission appointed by President Grant to examine the
condition of the island, the government of which desired annexation;
and when that scheme was defeated through Sumner&rsquo;s
opposition he returned (1872) as the representative of the
Samana Bay Company, which proposed to take a lease of the
Samana peninsula; but though in 1874 he revisited the island, it
was only to see the flag of the company hauled down. His health
was then breaking and began soon after to fail rapidly, and on
the 9th of January 1876 he died at Boston. The governor of the
state sent a special message of grief to the legislature on his death,
eulogies were delivered in the two houses, and a public memorial
service was held, at which Dr O. W. Holmes read a poem.
Whittier had in his lifetime commemorated him in his poem
&ldquo;The Hero,&rdquo; in which he called him &ldquo;the Cadmus of the blind&rdquo;;
and in 1901 a centennial celebration of his birth was held at
Boston, at which, among other notable tributes, Senator Hoar
spoke of Howe as &ldquo;one of the great figures of American history.&rdquo;


A Memoir of Dr Howe by his wife appeared in 1876. See also
the Letters and Journals of S. G. Howe, edited by Laura E. Richards
(1910).

HOWE, WILLIAM HOWE, 5th Viscount (1729-1814),
British general, was the younger brother of George Augustus,
3rd viscount, killed in the Ticonderoga expedition of 1758, and
of Richard, 4th viscount and afterwards Earl Howe, the admiral.
He entered the cavalry in 1746, becoming lieutenant a year later.
On the disbanding of his regiment in 1749 he was made captain-lieutenant
and shortly afterwards captain in Lord Bury&rsquo;s (20th)
regiment, in which Wolfe was then a field officer. Howe became
major in 1756 and lieutenant-colonel in 1757 of the 58th (now
Northampton) regiment, which he commanded at the capture
of Louisburg. In Wolfe&rsquo;s expedition to Quebec he distinguished
himself greatly at the head of a composite light battalion. He
led the advanced party in the landing at Wolfe&rsquo;s Cove and took
part in the battle of the Plains of Abraham which followed. He
commanded his own regiment in the defence of Quebec in 1759-1760,
led a brigade in the advance on Montreal and took part on
his return to Europe in the siege of Belleisle (1761). He was
adjutant-general of the force which besieged and took Havana in
1762, and at the close of the war had acquired the reputation of
being one of the most brilliant of the junior officers of the army.
He was made colonel of the 46th foot in 1764 and lieutenant-governor
of the Isle of Wight four years later. From 1758 to 1780
he was M.P. for Nottingham. In 1772 he became major-general,
and in 1774 he was entrusted with the training of light infantry
companies on a new system, the training-ground being Salisbury
Plain.

Shortly after this he was sent out to North America. He did
not agree with the policy of the government towards the colonists,
and regretted in particular that he was sent to Boston, where the
memory of his eldest brother was still cherished by the inhabitants,
and General Gage, in whom he had no confidence, commanded in
chief. He was the senior officer after Gage, and led the troops
actively engaged in the storming of Bunker Hill, he himself being
in the thickest of the fighting. In the same year Howe was
made a K.B. and a lieutenant-general, and appointed, with the
local rank of general, to the chief command in the seat of war.
For the events of his command see American War of Independence.
He retained it until May 1778&mdash;on the whole with
success. The cause of his resignation was his feeling that the
home government had not afforded the proper support, and
after his return to England, he and his brother engaged in a
heated but fruitless controversy with the ministers. Howe&rsquo;s own
defence is embodied in Narrative of Sir William Howe before a
Committee of the House of Commons (London, 1780). In 1782
Howe was made lieutenant-general of the ordnance; in 1790 he
was placed in command of the forces organized for action against
Spain, and in 1793 he was made a full general. He held various
home commands in the early part of the French revolutionary
war, in particular that of the eastern district at the critical
moment when the French established their forces on the Dutch
coast. When Earl Howe died in 1799, Sir William succeeded to
the Irish viscounty. He had been made governor of Berwick-on-Tweed
in 1795, and in 1805 he became governor of Plymouth,
where he died on the 12th of July 1814. With his death the
Irish peerage became extinct.



HOWEL DDA (&ldquo;the Good&rdquo;) (d. 950), prince of Deheubarth
(South Central Wales) from before 915, and king of Wales from
943 to 950, was the grandson of Rhodri Mawr (the Great), who
had united practically the whole of Wales under his supremacy.
As Idwal Voel succeeded his father Anarawd, the elder son of
Rhodri, as lord of Gwynedd in 915, so Howel at some time before
that date succeeded Rhodri&rsquo;s younger son Cadell as prince of
Deheubarth. Howel married Elen, daughter of the last king of
Dyfed, and also added Kidweli and Gwyr to his dominions, while
on the death of Idwal, who was slain by the English in 943, he
took possession of Gwynedd. Both these princes had done
homage to the English kings, Edward the Elder and Aethelstan,
in 922 and 926, and we find that Howel attended the witans
of the English kingdom and witnessed about ten charters between
the years 931 and 949. He was secure, therefore, from attack on
the eastern side of his kingdom, and it is not certain whether he
was engaged in any of the battles recorded during these years in
Wales, either in Môn 914, at Dinas Newydd 919 or at Brun 935.
To the peaceful character of his reign is probably due the high
place which he holds among the Welsh princes. From 943 to
950 Howel Dda was probably ruler of all Wales except Powys
(apparently dependent on Mercia), Brecheiniog, Buallt, Gwent
and Morgannwg. With Morgan Hen, king of Morgannwg,
Howel had a dispute which was eventually settled in favour of the
former at the court of the English king. Howel died in 950, and
such unity as he had preserved at once disappeared in a war
between his sons and those of Idwal Voel. The code of laws
attributed to this prince is perhaps his chief claim to fame. He
is said to have summoned four men from each cantref in his
dominions to the Ty Gwyn (perhaps Whitland in Caermarthenshire)
to codify existing custom. Three codes, accordingly called
Venedotian, Demetian and Gwentian, are said to have been written
down by Bleggwryd, archdeacon of Llandaff (see Welsh Laws).


See Sir John Rhys and Brynmor-Jones, The Welsh People (London,
1900); and Aneurin Owen, Ancient Laws and Institutions of Wales
(London, 1841).




HOWELL, JAMES (c. 1594-1666), British author, who came
of an old Welsh family, was born probably at Abernant, in
Carmarthenshire, where his father was rector. From the free
grammar school at Hereford he went to Jesus College, Oxford,
and took his degree of B.A. in 1613. About 1616 he was steward
in Sir Robert Mansell&rsquo;s glass-works in Broad Street, and was
commissioned to go abroad to procure the services of expert
839
workmen. It was not till 1622 that he returned, having visited
Holland, France, Spain and Italy. With the intention of utilizing
to better purpose his knowledge of continental languages
and methods, he left the glass business and applied for a diplomatic
post. Failing to obtain this, he was for a short time
tutor in a nobleman&rsquo;s family. At the close of 1622 he was sent
on a special mission to Madrid to obtain redress for the seizure
of an English vessel, but, owing to the presence at the Spanish
court of Prince Charles and the duke of Buckingham to arrange
a marriage between the prince and the infanta of Spain, the
negotiations had to be broken off. He made many friends
among the prince&rsquo;s retinue, and, after his return in 1624, applied
for employment to the duke of Buckingham, but without success.
In 1626 he became secretary to Lord Scrope, Lord President
of the North at York, and retained the office under Scrope&rsquo;s
successor, Thomas Wentworth. In 1627 he was elected M.P.
for Richmond; in 1632 he was sent as secretary to the embassy
of the earl of Leicester to Denmark; and in 1642 the king
appointed him one of the clerks of the privy council. In 1643
he was committed to the Fleet prison by the parliament, according
to his own account, on suspicion of royalist leanings, or, as
Anthony à Wood says, for debt. Whatever the reason, he
remained in prison until 1651. He had acquired considerable
fame by his allegorical &#916;&#949;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#945;: Dodona&rsquo;s Grove, or the
Vocall Forest, published in 1640, and his Instructions for Forreine
Travell (1642), which has been described as the first continental
handbook; and now he was driven to maintain himself by his
pen. He edited and supplemented (1650) Cotgrave&rsquo;s French and
English dictionary, compiled Lexicon Tetraglotton, or an English,
French, Italian and Spanish Dictionary (London, 1660), translated
various works from Italian and Spanish, wrote a life of
Louis XIII. and issued a number of political pamphlets, varying
the point of view somewhat to suit the changes of the time.
Among these tracts may be mentioned a rather malicious
Perfect Description of the People and Country of Scotland, which
was revived by John Wilkes and printed in the North Briton
during the agitation directed against Lord Bute. In 1660 he
asked for the place of clerk of the privy council; and, though
this was not granted him, the post of historiographer royal was
created for him. In 1661 he applied for the office of tutor in
foreign languages to the infanta Catherine of Braganza, and in
1662 published an English Grammar translated into Spanish.
He was buried in the Temple Church on the 3rd of November
1666, having realized to the last his favourite motto, &ldquo;Senesco
non segnesco.&rdquo;

All Howell&rsquo;s writings are imbued with a certain simplicity
and quaintness. His elaborate allegories are forgotten; his
linguistic labours, of value in their time, are now superseded;
but his Letters, the Epistolae Ho-elianae (four volumes issued in
1645, 1647, 1650 and 1655), are still models of their kind. Their
dates are often fictitious, and they are, in nearly every case,
evidently written for publication. Thackeray said that the Letters
was one of his bedside books. He classes it with Montaigne
and says he scarcely ever tired of &ldquo;the artless prattle&rdquo; of the
&ldquo;priggish little clerk of King Charles&rsquo;s council.&rdquo;


The Epistolae have been frequently edited, notably by J. Jacobs
in 1890, with a commentary (1891), and Agnes Repplier (1907).




HOWELLS, WILLIAM DEAN (1837-&emsp;&emsp;), American novelist,
was born at Martin&rsquo;s Ferry, Ohio, on the 1st of March 1837. His
father, William Cooper Howells, a printer-journalist, moved in
1840 to Hamilton, Ohio, and here the boy&rsquo;s early life was spent
successively as type-setter, reporter and editor in the offices
of various newspapers. In the midst of routine work he contrived
to familiarize himself with a wide range of authors in several
modern tongues, and to drill himself thoroughly in the use of
good English. In 1860, as assistant editor of the leading Republican
newspaper in Ohio, he wrote&mdash;in connexion with the
Presidential contest&mdash;the campaign life of Lincoln; and in
the same year he was appointed consul at Venice, where he
remained till 1865. On his return to America he joined the staff
of the Atlantic Monthly, and from 1872 to 1881 he was its editor-in-chief.
Since 1885 he has lived in New York. For a time he
conducted for Harper&rsquo;s Magazine the department called &ldquo;The
Editor&rsquo;s Study,&rdquo; and in December 1900 he revived for the same
periodical the department of &ldquo;The Easy Chair,&rdquo; which had
lapsed with the death of George William Curtis. Of Mr Howells&rsquo;s
many novels, the following may be mentioned as specially
noteworthy: Their Wedding Journey (1872); The Lady of
the Aroostook (1879); A Modern Instance (1882); The Rise
of Silas Lapham (1885); The Minister&rsquo;s Charge (1886); A
Hazard of New Fortunes (1889); The Quality of Mercy (1892);
The Landlord at Lion&rsquo;s Head (1897). He also published Poems
(1873 and 1886); Stops of Various Quills (1895), a book of verse;
books of travel; several amusing farces; and volumes of essays
and literary criticism, among others, Literary Friends and
Acquaintance (1901), which contains much autobiographical
matter, Literature and Life (1902), and English Films (1905).

Howells is by general consent the foremost representative
of the realistic school of indigenous American fiction. From
the outset his aim was to portray life with entire fidelity in all
its commonplaceness, and yet to charm the reader into a liking
for this commonplaceness and into reverence for what it conceals.
Though in his earliest novels his method was not consistently
realistic&mdash;he is at times almost as personal and as whimsical as
Thackeray&mdash;yet his vivid impressionism and his choice of subjects,
as well as an occasional explicit protest that &ldquo;dulness
is dear to him,&rdquo; already revealed unmistakably his realistic
bias. In A Modern Instance (1882) he gained complete command
of his method, and began a series of studies of American life
that are remarkable for their loyalty to fact, their truth of tone,
and their power to reveal, despite their strictly objective method,
both the inner springs of American character and the sociological
forces that are shaping American civilization. He refuses to over-sophisticate
or to over-intellectualize his characters, and he
is very sparing in his use of psychological analysis. He insists
on seeing and portraying American life as it exists in and for
itself, under its own skies and with its own atmosphere; he
does not scrutinize it with foreign comparisons in mind, and thus
try to find and to throw into relief unsuspected configurations
of surface. He keeps his dialogue toned down to almost the
pitch of everyday conversation, although he has shown in his
comedy sketches how easy a master he is of adroit and witty
talk.

1889); H. C. Vedder, American Writers (Boston, 1894).




HOWITT WILLIAM, (1792-1879), English author, was born
on the 18th of December 1792 at Heanor, Derbyshire. His
parents were Quakers, and he was educated at the Friends&rsquo;
public school at Ackworth, Yorkshire. In 1814 he published
a poem on the &ldquo;Influence of Nature and Poetry on National
Spirit.&rdquo; He married, in 1821, Mary Botham (1799-1888), like
himself a Quaker and a poet. William and Mary Howitt collaborated
throughout a long literary career, the first of their
joint productions being The Forest Minstrels and other Poems
(1821). In 1831 William Howitt produced a work for which
his habits of observation and his genuine love of nature peculiarly
fitted him. It was a history of the changes in the face of the outside
world in the different months of the year, and was entitled
The Book of the Seasons, or the Calendar of Nature (1831). His
Popular History of Priestcraft (1833) won for him the favour of
active Liberals and the office of alderman in Nottingham, where
the Howitts had made their home. They removed in 1837 to
Esher, and in 1840 they went to Heidelberg, primarily for the
education of their children, remaining in Germany for two years.
In 1841 William Howitt produced, under the pseudonym of
&ldquo;Dr Cornelius,&rdquo; The Student Life of Germany, the first of a
series of works on German social life and institutions. Mary
Howitt devoted herself to Scandinavian literature, and between
1842 and 1863 she translated the novels of Frederika Bremer
and many of the stories of Hans Andersen. With her husband
she wrote in 1852 The Literature and Romance of Northern
Europe. In June of that year William Howitt, with two of
his sons, set sail for Australia, where he spent two years in the
goldfields. The results of his travels appeared in A Boy&rsquo;s
840
Adventures in the Wilds of Australia (1854), Land, Labour and
Gold; or, Two Years in Victoria (1855) and Tallangetta, the
Squatter&rsquo;s Home (1857). On his return to England Howitt had
settled at Highgate and resumed his indefatigable book-making.
From 1856 to 1862 he was engaged on Cassell&rsquo;s Illustrated
History of England, and from 1861 to 1864 he and his wife worked
at the Ruined Abbeys and Castles of Great Britain. The Howitts
had left the Society of Friends in 1847, and became interested
in spiritualism. In 1863 appeared The History of the Supernatural
in all Ages and Nations, and in all Churches, Christian
and Pagan, demonstrating a Universal Faith, by William
Howitt. He added &ldquo;his own conclusions from a practical
examination of the higher phenomena through a course of
seven years.&rdquo; From 1870 onwards Howitt spent the summers
in Tirol and the winters in Rome, where he died on the 3rd
of March 1879. Mary Howitt was much affected by his death,
and in 1882 she joined the Roman Catholic Church, towards
which she had been gradually moving during her connexion with
spiritualism. She died at Rome on the 30th of January 1888.
The Howitts are remembered for their untiring efforts to provide
wholesome and instructive literature. Their son, Alfred William
Howitt, made himself a name by his explorations in Australia.
Anna Mary Howitt married Alaric Alfred Watts, and was the
author of Pioneers of the Spiritual Reformation (1883).


Mary Howitt&rsquo;s autobiography was edited by her daughter, Margaret
Howitt, in 1889. William Howitt wrote some fifty books, and his
wife&rsquo;s publications, inclusive of translations, number over a hundred.




HOWITZER (derived, through an earlier form howitz, and the
Ger. Haubitz, from the Bohemian houfnice = catapult, from
which come also, through the Ital. obiza or obice, the French
forms obus = shell and obusier = howitzer), a form of mobile
ordnance in use from the 16th century up to the present day. It is
a short and therefore comparatively light gun, which fires a
heavy projectile at low velocity. A high angle of elevation is
always given and the angle of descent of the projectile is consequently
steep (up to 70°). On this fact is based the tactical
use of the modern howitzer. The field howitzer is of the greatest
value for &ldquo;searching&rdquo; trenches, folds of ground, localities, &amp;c.,
which are invulnerable to direct fire, while the more powerful
siege howitzer has, since the introduction of modern artillery and,
above all, of modern projectiles, taken the foremost place
amongst the weapons used in siege warfare.


See Artillery, Ordnance and Fortification and Siegecraft.




HOWLER, a name applied to the members of a group of
tropical American monkeys, now known scientifically as Alouata,
although formerly designated Mycetes. These monkeys, which
are of large size, with thick fur, sometimes red and sometimes
black in colour, are characterized by the inflation of the hyoid-bone
(which supports the roof of the tongue) into a large shell-like
organ communicating with the wind-pipe, and giving the
peculiar resonance to the voice from which they take their title.
To allow space for the hyoid, the sides of the lower jaw are very
deep and expanded. The muzzle is projecting, and the profile of
the face slopes regularly backwards from the muzzle to the
crown. The long tail is highly prehensile, thickly furred, with the
under surface of the extremity naked. Howlers dwell in large
companies, and in the early morning, and again in the evening,
make the woods resound with their cries, which are often continued
throughout the night. They feed on leaves, and are in the
habit of sitting on the topmost branches of trees. When active,
they progress in regular order, led by an old male.
(R. L.*)



HOWRAH, a city and district of British India, in the Burdwan
division of Bengal. The city is situated opposite Calcutta, with
which it is connected by a floating bridge. The municipal area
is about 11 sq. m.; pop. (1901) 157,594, showing an increase of
35% in the decade. Since 1872 the population has almost
doubled, owing to the great industrial development that has
taken place. Howrah is the terminus of the East Indian railway,
and also of the Bengal-Nagpur and East Coast lines. It is
also the centre of two light railways which run to Amta and
Sheakhala. Further, it is the headquarters of the jute-manufacturing
industry, with many steam mills, steam presses, also
cotton mills, oil mills, rope-works, iron-works and engineering
works. Sibpur Engineering College lies on the outskirts of the
town. There is a hospital, with a department for Europeans, and
Howrah forms a suburban residence for many people who have
their place of business in Calcutta.

The District of Howrah extends southwards down the right
bank of the Hugli to the confluence of the river Damodar. For
revenue purposes it is included within the district of Hugli
Its area is 510 sq. m.; pop. (1901) 850,514, showing an increase
of 11% in the decade. In addition to the two steam tramways
and the East Indian railway, the district is crossed by the high-level
canal to Midnapore, which communicates with the Hugli
at Ulubaria. The manufacturing industries of Howrah extend
beyond the city into the district. One or two systems of draining
low-lying lands are maintained by the government.



HOWSON, JOHN SAUL (1816-1885), English divine, was born
at Giggleswick-in-Craven, Yorkshire, on the 5th of May 1816.
After receiving his early education at Giggleswick school, of
which his father was head-master, he went to Trinity College,
Cambridge, and there became tutor successively to the marquis of
Sligo and the marquis of Lorne. In 1845 Howson, having taken
orders, accepted the post of senior classical master at the Liverpool
College under his friend W. J. Conybeare, whom he succeeded
as principal in 1849. This post he held until 1865, and it was
largely due to his influence that a similar college for girls was
established at Liverpool. In 1866 he left Liverpool for the
vicarage of Wisbech, and in 1867 he was appointed dean of
Chester Cathedral, where he gave himself vigorously to the work
of restoring the crumbling fabric, collecting nearly £100,000 in
five years for this purpose. His sympathies were with the
evangelical party, and he stoutly opposed the &ldquo;Eastward
position,&rdquo; but he was by no means narrow. He did much to
reintroduce the ministry of women as deaconesses. The building
of the King&rsquo;s School for boys, and the Queen&rsquo;s School for girls
(both in Chester), was due in a great measure to the active
interest which he took in educational matters. He died at
Bournemouth on the 15th of December 1885, and was buried in
the cloister garth of Chester. Howson&rsquo;s chief literary production
was The Life and Epistles of St Paul (1852) in which he collaborated
with Conybeare.


The book is still of interest, especially for its descriptive passages,
which were mostly done by Howson; but later researches (such as
those of Sir W. M. Ramsay) have made the geographical and historical
sections obsolete, and the same may be said of the treatment
of the Pauline theology.




HOWTH [pronounced H&#333;th], a seaside town of Co. Dublin,
Ireland, on the rocky hill of Howth, which forms the northern
horn of Dublin Bay, 9 m. N.E. by N. of Dublin by the Great
Northern railway. Pop. (1901) 1166. It is frequented by the
residents of the capital as a watering-place. The artificial
harbour was formed (1807-1832) between the mainland and the
picturesque island of Ireland&rsquo;s Eye, and preceded Kingstown as
the station for the mail-packets from Great Britain, but was
found after its construction to be liable to silt, and is now chiefly
used by fishing-boats and yachts. The collegiate church,
standing picturesquely on a cliff above the sea, was founded
about 1235, and has a monastic building attached to it. The
embattled castle contains the two-handed sword of Sir Almeric
Tristram, the Anglo-Norman conqueror of the hill of Howth, and
a portrait of Dean Swift holding one of the Drapier letters, with
Wood, the coiner against whom he directed these attacks,
prostrate before him. The view of Dublin Bay from the hill of
Howth is of great beauty. Howth is connected with the capital
by electric tramway, besides the railway, and another tramway
encircles the hill.



HÖXTER, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of
Westphalia, prettily situated on the left bank of the Weser, and
on the Prussian state railways Börssum-Soest and Scherfede-Holzminden,
32 m. N. of Cassel. Pop. (1905) 7699. It has a
medieval town hall, and interesting houses with high gables and
wood-carved façades of the 15th and 16th centuries. The most
interesting of the churches is the Protestant church of St Kilian,
841
with a pulpit dating from 1595 and a font dating from 1631.
There are a gymnasium, a school of architecture and a monument
to Hoffmann von Fallersleben in the town. The Weser is
crossed here by a stone bridge about 500 ft. in length, erected
in 1833. On the Brunsberg adjoining the town there is an old
watch-tower, said to be the remains of a fortress built by Bruno,
brother of Widukind. Near Höxter is the castle, formerly the
Benedictine monastery, of Corvey. The principal manufactures of
the town are linen, cotton, cement and gutta-percha, and there
is also a considerable shipping trade. Höxter (Lat. Huxaria)
in the time of Charlemagne was a villa regia, and was the scene of
a battle between him and the Saxons. Under the protection of
the monastery of Corvey it gradually increased in prosperity,
and became the chief town of the principality of Corvey. Later
it asserted its independence and joined the Hanseatic League.
It suffered severely during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. After the
peace of Westphalia in 1648 it was united to Brunswick; in 1802
it was transferred to Nassau; and in 1807 to the kingdom of
Westphalia, after the dismemberment of which, in 1814, it came
into the possession of Prussia.


See Kampschulte, Chronik der Stadt Höxter (Höxter, 1872).




HOY (Norse Haey, &ldquo;high island&rdquo;), the second largest island
of the Orkneys, county of Orkney, Scotland. Pop. (1901) 1216.
It has an extreme length from N.W. to S.E. of 131&frasl;3 m., its greatest
breadth from E. to W. is 8 m., and its area occupies 53 sq. m.
It is situated 2 m. S.W. of Pomona, from which it is separated
by Hoy Sound. As seen from the west it rises abruptly from the
sea, presenting in this respect a marked contrast to the rest of
the isles of the Orcadian group, which as a whole are low-lying.
Its eastern and southern shores are indented by numerous bays,
one of which, Long Hope, forms a natural harbour 4 m. long,
with a breadth varying from ¼ m. to more than 1 m., affording
to any number of vessels a haven of refuge from the roughest
weather of the Pentland Firth. Off the eastern coast lie the
islands of Graemsay, Cava, Risa, Fara, Flotta and Switha,
while the peninsula of South Walls, forming the southern side
of the harbour of Long Hope, is an island in all but name. Red
and yellow sandstone cliffs, sometimes over 1000 ft. in height,
stretch for 10 to 12 m. on the Atlantic front. The detached
pillar or stack called the Old Man of Hoy (450 ft.) is a well-known
landmark to sailors. The only break in this remarkable run
of rocky coast is at Rackwick in the bight below the head of
Rora. In the interior, Ward Hill (1564 ft.) is the loftiest summit
in either the Orkneys or Shetlands. In the valley between
Ward Hill and the ridge of the Hamars to the south-east is
situated the famous Dwarfie Stone, an enormous block of
sandstone measuring 28 ft. long, from 11 ft. to 14½ ft. broad,
and 6½ ft. high at one end and 2 ft. high at the other, in which
two rooms have been artificially hollowed out, traditionally
believed to be the bed-chambers of Trolld, the dwarf of the
sagas, and his wife. A boulder lying at the narrow end was
supposed to be used to close the entrance. The generally
accepted theory is that it was a pagan altar which some hermit
afterwards converted into a cell. Other hills in the island are
the Cuilags (1420 ft.) and the Knap of Trewieglen (1308 ft.),
besides several peaks exceeding 1000 ft. in height. Hoy is
commonly approached from Stromness, there being piers at
Linksness, the nearest point to Graemsay, and at Hackness,
South Ness and North Bay, the last three all on the harbour
of Long Hope.



HOYLAKE, a watering-place in the Wirral parliamentary
division of Cheshire, England, 8 m. W. of Birkenhead, on the
Wirral railway. With West Kirby to the south, at the mouth
of the estuary of the Dee, it forms the urban district of Hoylake
and West Kirby. Pop. (1901) 10,911. The well-known links
of the Royal Liverpool Golf Club are at Hoylake. The town
has a considerable population of fishermen.



HOYLAND NETHER, an urban district in the Hallamshire
parliamentary division of the West Riding of Yorkshire, England,
5½ m. S.S.E. of Barnsley, on the Midland railway. Collieries
and brickworks employ the large industrial population. Pop.
(1901) 12,464.



HOYLE, EDMUND, or Edmond (1672-1769), the first systematizer
of the laws of whist, and author of a book on games,
was born in 1672. His parentage and place of birth are unknown,
and few details of his life are recorded. For some time he was
resident in London, and partially supported himself by giving
instruction in the game of whist. For the use of his pupils he
drew up a Short Treatise on the game, which after circulating
for some time in manuscript was printed by him and entered
at Stationers&rsquo; Hall in November 1742. The laws of Hoyle
continued to be regarded as authoritative until 1864, since which
time they have been gradually superseded by the new rules
adopted by the Arlington and Portland clubs in that year (see
Whist). He also published rules for various other games, and
his book on games, which includes the Short Treatise, has passed
into many editions. The weight of his authority is indicated
by the phrase &ldquo;according to Hoyle,&rdquo; which, doubtless first
applied with reference to whist, has gained currency as a general
proverb. Hoyle died in London on the 29th of August 1769.



HOZIER, PIERRE D&rsquo;, Seigneur de la Garde (1592-1660),
French genealogist, was born at Marseilles on the 10th of July
1592. In 1616 he entered upon some very extensive researches
into the genealogy of the noble families of the kingdom, in which
work he was aided by his prodigious memory for dates, names
and family relationships, as well as by his profound knowledge
of heraldry. In 1634 he was appointed historiographer and
genealogist of France, and in 1641 juge d&rsquo;armes of France, an
officer corresponding nearly to the Garter king-of-arms in
England. In 1643 he was employed to verify the claims to
nobility of the pages and equerries of the king&rsquo;s household. He
accumulated a large number of documents, but published
comparatively little, his principal works being Recueil armorial
des anciennes maisons de Bretagne (1638); Les noms, surnoms,
qualitez, armes et blasons des chevaliers et officiers de l&rsquo;ordre du
Saint-Esprit (1634); and the genealogies of the houses of La
Rochefoucauld (1654), Bournonville (1657) and Amanzé (1659).
He was renowned as much for his uprightness as for his knowledge,
no slight praise in a profession exposed to so many temptations
to fraud. He died in Paris on the 1st of December 1660. At
his death his collections comprised more than 150 volumes or
portfolios of documents and papers relating to the genealogy of
the principal families in France. Of his six sons, only two
survived him. His eldest son, Louis Roger d&rsquo;Hozier (1634-1708),
succeeded him as juge d&rsquo;armes, but became blind in 1675, and
was obliged to surrender his office to his brother.

Charles René d&rsquo;Hozier (1640-1732), younger son of Pierre,
was the true continuator of his father. In addition to his
commentary appended to Antoine Varillas&rsquo;s history of King
Charles IX. (1686 ed.), he published Recherches sur la noblesse
de Champagne (1673). On the promulgation in 1696 of an
edict directing all who had armorial bearings to register them
on payment of 20 livres, he was employed to collect the declarations
returned in the various généralités, and established the
Armorial général de France. This work, which contained not
only the armorial bearings of noble families, but also of those
commoners who were entitled to bear arms, is not complete,
inasmuch as many refused to register their arms, either from
vanity or from a desire to evade the fee.


The collection (now in the Bibliothèque Nationale) consists of
34 volumes of text and 35 of coloured armorial bearings, and in
spite of its deficiencies is a useful store of information for the history
of the old French families. It contains 60,000 names, grouped
according to provinces and provincial subdivisions. The sections
relating to Burgundy and Franche-Comté were published by Henri
Bouchot (1875-1876): those relating to the généralité of Limoges,
by Moreau de Pravieux (1895); and those for the élection of Reims,
by P. Gosset (1903).


In 1717, in consequence of a quarrel with his nephew Louis
Pierre, son of Louis Roger, Charles sold his collection to the
king. It then comprised 160 portfolios of genealogical papers
arranged alphabetically, 175 volumes of documents, and numerous
printed books profusely annotated. In 1720 it was inventoried
by P. de Clairambault, who added a certain number of genealogies
taken from the papers of F. R. de Gaignières, increasing the
842
total to 217 boxes and portfolios. Thus originated the Cabinet
des titres of the Bibliothèque Nationale. Charles subsequently
became reconciled to his nephew, to whom he left all the papers
he had accumulated from the date of the quarrel until his death,
which occurred in Paris on the 13th of February 1732.

Louis Pierre d&rsquo;Hozier (1685-1767), son of Louis Roger,
succeeded his uncle Charles as juge d&rsquo;armes. He published the
Armorial général, ou registre de la noblesse de France (10 vols.,
1738-1768), which must not be confounded with the publication
mentioned above, inasmuch as it related solely to noble families
and was not an official collection. Complete copies of this work,
which should contain six registres, are comparatively rare.
A seventh registre, forming vol. xi., prepared by Ambroise
Louis Marie, nephew of Louis Pierre, was published in 1847 by
comte Charles d&rsquo;Hozier. Louis Pierre died on the 25th of
September 1767. His eldest son, Antoine Marie d&rsquo;Hozier de
Sérigny (1721-c. 1810), was his father&rsquo;s collaborator and continuator;
and his fourth son, Jean François Louis, wrote an
account of the knights of St Michael in the province of Poitou,
which was published in 1896 by the vicomte P. de Chabot.

His nephew, Ambroise Louis Marie d&rsquo;Hozier (1764-1846),
was the last of the juges d&rsquo;armes of France. He held the position
of president of the cour des comptes, aides et finances of Normandy,
and was therefore generally known as President d&rsquo;Hozier, to
distinguish him from the other members of the family. After
the Restoration he was employed to verify French armorial
bearings for the conseil du sceau des titres. He died in obscurity.
His collection, which was purchased in 1851 by the Bibliothèque
Nationale, comprised 136 volumes, 165 portfolios of documents
and 200 packets of extracts from title-deeds, known as the
Carrés d&rsquo;Hozier.

Abraham Charles Auguste d&rsquo;Hozier (1775-1846), who
also belonged to his family, was implicated in the conspiracy
of Georges Cadoudal, and was condemned to death, but Bonaparte
spared his life. He did not, however, recover his liberty
until after the fall of the emperor, and died at Versailles on
the 24th of August 1846.

HRABANUS MAURUS MAGNENTIUS (c. 776-856), archbishop
of Mainz, and one of the most prominent teachers and
writers of the Carolingian age, was born of noble parents at Mainz.
Less correct forms of his name are Rabanus and Rhabanus.
The date of his birth is uncertain, but in 801 he received deacon&rsquo;s
orders at Fulda, where he had been sent to school; in the following
year, at the instance of Ratgar, his abbot, he went together
with Haimon (afterwards of Halberstadt) to complete his studies
at Tours under Alcuin, who in recognition of his diligence and
purity gave him the surname of Maurus, after St Maur the
favourite disciple of Benedict. Returning after the lapse of
two years to Fulda, he was entrusted with the principal charge
of the school, which under his direction rose into a state of great
efficiency for that age, and sent forth such pupils as Walafrid
Strabo, Servatus Lupus of Ferières and Otfrid of Weissenburg.
At this period it is most probable that his Excerptio from the
grammar of Priscian, long so popular as a text-book during the
middle ages, was compiled. In 814 he was ordained a priest;
but shortly afterwards, apparently on account of disagreement
with Ratgar, he was compelled to withdraw for a time from
Fulda. This &ldquo;banishment&rdquo; is understood to have occasioned
the pilgrimage to Palestine to which he alludes in his commentary
on Joshua. He returned to Fulda on the election of a new abbot
(Eigil) in 817, upon whose death in 822 he himself became abbot.
The duties of this office he discharged with efficiency and success
until 842, when, in order to secure greater leisure for literature
and for devotion, he resigned and retired to the neighbouring
cloister of St Peter&rsquo;s. In 847 he was again constrained to enter
public life by his election to succeed Otgar in the archbishopric
of Mainz, which see he occupied for upwards of eight years.
The principal incidents of historical interest belonging to this
period of his life were those which arose out of his relations to
Gottschalk (q.v.): they may be regarded as thoroughly typical
of that cruel intolerance which he shared with all his contemporaries,
and also of that ardent zeal which was peculiar to himself;
but they hardly do justice to the spirit of kindly benevolence
which in less trying circumstances he was ever ready to display.
He died at Winkel on the Rhine, on the 4th of February 856.
He is frequently referred to as St Rabanus, but incorrectly.


His voluminous works, many of which remain unpublished, comprise
commentaries on a considerable number of the books both of
canonical and of apocryphal Scripture (Genesis to Judges, Ruth,
Kings, Chronicles, Judith, Esther, Canticles, Proverbs, Wisdom,
Ecclesiasticus, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Maccabees,
Matthew, the Epistles of St Paul, including Hebrews); and various
treatises relating to doctrinal and practical subjects, including more
than one series of Homilies. Perhaps the most important is that De
institutione clericorum, in three books, by which he did much to
bring into prominence the views of Augustine and Gregory the
Great as to the training which was requisite for a right discharge
of the clerical function; the most popular has been a comparatively
worthless tract De laudibus sanctae crucis. Among the others
may be mentioned the De universo libri xxii., sive etymologiarum
opus, a kind of dictionary or encyclopaedia, designed as a help
towards the historical and mystical interpretation of Scripture, the
De sacris ordinibus, the De disciplina ecclesiastica and the Martyrologium.
All of them are characterized by erudition (he knew even
some Greek and Hebrew) rather than by originality of thought.
The poems are of singularly little interest or value, except as including
one form of the &ldquo;Veni Creator.&rdquo; In the annals of German
philology a special interest attaches to the Glossaria Latino-Theodisca.
A commentary, Super Porphyrium, printed by Cousin in 1836 among
the Ouvrages inédits d&rsquo;Abélard, and assigned both by that editor
and by Hauréau to Hrabanus Maurus, is now generally believed to
have been the work of a disciple.

The first nominally complete edition of the works of Hrabanus
Maurus was that of Colvener (Cologne, 6 vols. fol., 1627). The
Opera omnia form vols. cvii.-cxii. of Migne&rsquo;s Patrologiae cursus
completus. The De universo is the subject of Compendium der
Naturwissenschaften an der Schule zu Fulda im IX. Jahrhundert
(Berlin, 1880). Maurus is the subject of monographs by Schwarz
(De Rhabano Mauro primo Germaniae praeceptore, 1811), Kunstmann
(Historische Monographie über Hrabanus Magnentius Maurus, 1841),
Spengler (Leben des heil. Rhabanus Maurus, 1856) and Köhler
(Rhabanus Maurus u. die Schule zu Fulda, 1870). Lives by his
disciple Rudolphus and by Joannes Trithemius are printed in the
Cologne edition of the Opera. See also Pertz, Monum. Germ. Hist.
(i. and ii.); Bähr, Gesch. d. römischen Literatur im Karoling.

HRÓLFR KRAKI, perhaps the most famous of the Danish
kings of the heroic age. In Beowulf, where he is called Hrothwulf,
he is represented as reigning over Denmark in conjunction
with his uncle Hrothgar, one of the three sons of an earlier
king called Healfdene. In the Old Norse sagas Hrólfe is the son
of Helgi (Halga), the son of Halfdan (Healfdene). He is represented
as a wealthy and peace-loving monarch similar to Hrothgar
in Beowulf, but the latter (Hróarr, or Roe) is quite overshadowed
by his nephew in the Northern authorities. The chief incidents
in Hrólfr&rsquo;s career are the visit which he paid to the Swedish king
Aðils (Beowulf&rsquo;s Eadgils), of which several different explanations
are given, and the war, in which he eventually lost his life,
against his brother-in-law Hiörvarðr. The name Kraki (pole-ladder)
is said to have been given to him on account of his great
height by a young knight named Vöggr, whom he handsomely
rewarded and who eventually avenged his death on Hiörvarðr.
There is no reason to doubt that Hrólfr was an historical person
and that he reigned in Denmark during the early years of the
6th century, but the statement found in all the sagas that he
was the stepson of Aðils seems hardly compatible with the
evidence of Beowulf, which is a much earlier authority.

HROSVITHA (frequently Roswitha, and properly Hrotsuit),
early medieval dramatist and chronicler, occupies a very notable
position in the history of modern European literature. Her
endeavours formed part of the literary activity by which the age
of the emperor Otto the Great sought to emulate that of Charles
the Great. The famous nun of Gandersheim has occasionally
been confounded with her namesake, a learned abbess of the
same convent, who must have died at least half a century earlier.
The younger Hrosvitha was born in all probability about the year
935; and, if the statement be correct that she sang the praises
of the three Ottos, she must have lived to near the close of the
843
century. Some time before the year 959 she entered the Benedictine
nunnery of Gandersheim, a foundation which was confined
to ladies of German birth, and was highly favoured by
the Saxon dynasty. In 959 Gerberga, daughter of Duke Henry
of Bavaria and niece of the emperor Otto I., was consecrated
abbess of Gandersheim; and the earlier literary efforts of the
youthful Hrosvitha (whose own connexion with the royal family
appears to be an unauthenticated tradition) were encouraged
by the still more youthful abbess, and by a nun of the name of
Richarda.

The literary works of Hrosvitha, all of which were as a matter
of course in Latin, divide themselves into three groups. Of
these the first and least important comprises eight narrative
religious poems, in leonine hexameters or distichs. Their subjects
are the Nativity of the Virgin (from the apocryphal gospel of
St James, the brother of our Lord), the Ascension and a series
of legends of saints (Gandolph, Pelagius, Theophilus, Basil,
Denis, Agnes). Like these narrative poems, the dramas to which
above all Hrosvitha owes her fame seem to have been designed
for reading aloud or recitation by sisters of the convent. For
though there are indications that the idea of their representation
was at least present to the mind of the authoress, the fact of
such a representation appears to be an unwarrantable assumption.
The comedies of Hrosvitha are six in number, being doubtless
in this respect also intended to recall their nominal model, the
comedies of Terence. They were devised on the simple principle
that the world, the flesh and the devil should not have all the
good plays to themselves. The experiment upon which the young
Christian dramatist ventured was accordingly, although not
absolutely novel, audacious enough. In form the dramas of
&ldquo;the strong voice of Gandersheim,&rdquo; as Hrosvitha (possibly
alluding to a supposed etymology of her name) calls herself, are
by no means Terentian. They are written in prose, with an
element of something like rhythm, and an occasional admixture
of rhyme. In their themes, and in the treatment of these, they
are what they were intended to be, the direct opposites of the
lightsome adapter of Menander. They are founded upon
legends of the saints, selected with a view to a glorification of
religion in its supremest efforts and most transcendental aspects.
The emperor Constantine&rsquo;s daughter, for example, Constantia,
gives her hand in marriage to Gallicanus, just before he starts
on a Scythian campaign, though she has already taken a vow
of perpetual maidenhood. In the hour of battle he is himself
converted, and, having on his return like his virgin bride chosen
the more blessed unmarried state, dies as a Christian martyr
in exile. The three holy maidens, Agape, Chionia and Irene,
are preserved by a humorous miracle from the evil designs of
Dulcitius, to offer up their pure lives as a sacrifice under
Diocletian&rsquo;s persecutions. Callimachus, who has Romeo-like
carried his earthly passion for the saintly Drusiana into her
tomb, and among its horrors has met with his own death, is
by the mediation of St John raised with her from the dead to
a Christian life. All these themes are treated with both spirit
and skill, often with instinctive knowledge of dramatic effect&mdash;often
with genuine touches of pathos and undeniable felicities
of expression. In Dulcitius there is also an element of comedy,
or rather of farce. How far Hrosvitha&rsquo;s comedies were an isolated
phenomenon of their age in Germany must remain undecided;
in the general history of the drama they form the visible bridge
between the few earlier attempts at utilizing the forms of the
classical drama for Christian purposes and the miracle plays.
They are in any case the productions of genius; nor has Hrosvitha
missed the usual tribute of the supposition that Shakespeare
has borrowed from her writings.

The third and last group of the writings of Hrosvitha is that
of her versified historical chronicles. At the request of the
abbess Gerberga, she composed her Carmen de gestis Oddonis,
an epic attempting in some degree to follow the great Roman
model. It was completed by the year 968, and presented by
the authoress to both the old emperor and his son (then already
crowned as) Otto II. This poem so closely adheres to the materials
supplied to the authoress by members of the imperial family
that, notwithstanding its courtly omissions, it is regarded as
an historical authority. Unfortunately only half of it remains;
the part treating of the period from 953 to 962 is lost with the
exception of a few fragments, and the period from 962 to
967 is summarized only. Subsequently, in a poem (of 837
hexameters) De primordiis et fundatoribus coenobii Gandersheimensis,
Hrosvitha narrated the beginnings of her own convent,
and its history up to the year 919.


The Munich MS., which contains all the works enumerated above
except the Chronicle of Gandersheim, was edited by the great Vienna
humanist, Conrad Celtes, in 1501. The edition of Celtes was published
at Nuremberg, with eight wood-cuts by Albrecht Dürer. It was
re-edited by H. L. Schurzfleisch and published at Wittenberg in
1707. The comedies have been edited and translated into German
by J. Bendixen (Lübeck, 1857), and into French by C. Magnin
(Paris, 1845), whose introduction gives a full account of the authoress
and her works. See also her Poésies latines, with a translation into
French verse by V. Rétif de la Bretonne (Paris, 1854). A copious
analysis of her plays will be found in Klein, Geschichte des Dramas,
iii. 665-754. See also W. Creizenach, Geschichte des neueren Dramas,
i. 17 sqq. (Halle, 1893), and A. W. Ward, History of English Dramatic
Literature, i. 6 sqq. (Cambridge, 1899). Gustav Freytag wrote a
dissertation, De Rosuitha poëtria (Breslau, 1839), to qualify himself
as an academical teacher, which, as he records (Erinnerungen aus
meinem Leben, Leipzig, 1887, p. 1839), showed &ldquo;how impossible it
was to the German, a thousand years since, to compose dramatically&rdquo;;
and at the beginning of Albert Cohn&rsquo;s Shakespeare in Germany
(Berlin, 1865) Shakespearean parallels are suggested to certain
passages in Hrosvitha&rsquo;s dramas. Her two chronicles in verse were
edited by Z. H. Pertz in the Monumenta Germaniae, iv. 306-335
(Hanover, 1841). See also J. P. Migne, Patrologiae curs. compl.
(Paris, 1853, vol. 137). The Carmen was included by Leibnitz
in his Scriptores rer. Brunsvic. (Hanover, 1707-1711). For other
early editions of these see A. Potthast, Bibliotheca historica medii
aevi (supplement, Berlin, 1862-1868); and for an appreciation of
them see Wattenbach, Geschichtsquellen, pp. 214-216, and Giesebrecht,
Deutsche Kaiserzeit, i. 780, who mentions a German translation by
Pfund (1860). There is a complete edition of the works of Hrosvitha
by K. A. Barack (Nürnberg, 1858). J. Aschbach (1867) attempted
to prove that Celtes had forged the productions which he published
under the name of Hrosvitha, but he was refuted by R. Köpke
(Berlin, 1869). Anatole France, La Vie littéraire (3ème série, Paris,
1891), cited by Creienach, mentions a curious recent experiment,
the performance of Hrosvitha&rsquo;s comedies in the Théâtre des
Marionettes at Paris.

HSÜAN TSANG (Hiouen Thsang, Hiwen T&rsquo;sang, Yüan
Tsang, Yuan-Chwang), the most eminent representative of a
remarkable and valuable branch of Chinese literature, consisting
of the narratives of Chinese Buddhists who travelled to India,
whilst their religion flourished there, with the view of visiting
the sites consecrated by the history of Sakya Muni, of studying
at the great convents which then existed in India, and of collecting
books, relics and other sacred objects.


The importance of these writings as throwing light on the geography
and history of India and adjoining countries, during a very
dark period, is great, and they have been the subject of elaborate
commentaries by modern students. Several Chinese memoirs of
this kind appear to have perished; and especially to be regretted
is a great collection of the works of travellers to India, religious and
secular, in sixty books, with forty more of maps and illustrations, published
at the expense of the emperor Kao-Tsung of the T&rsquo;ang dynasty,
A.D. 666, with a preface from the imperial hand. We will mention
the clerical travellers of this description who are known to us by name.

1. Shi-tao-&rsquo;an (d. 385) wrote a work on his travels to the
&ldquo;western lands&rdquo; (an expression applying often to India), which is
supposed to be lost. 2. Fa-hien travelled to India in 399, and
returned by sea in 414. His work, called Fo-Kwo-Ki, or Memoirs
on the Buddha Realms, has been translated by Abel-Rémusat and
Landresse, and again into English by the Rev. S. Beale; Mr Laidlay
of Calcutta also published a translation from the French, with interesting
notes. 3. Hwai Seng and Sung-Yun, monks, travelled
to India to collect books and reliques, 518-521. Their short narrative
has been translated by Karl Fried. Neumann, and also by Mr Beale
(along with Fa-hien). 4. Hsüan Tsang, the subject of this notice.
In relation to his travels there are two Chinese works, both of which
have been translated with an immense appliance of labour and
learning by M. Stanislas Julien, viz. (a) the Ta-T&rsquo;ang-Si-Yu-Ki, or
Memoirs on Western Countries issued by the T&rsquo;ang Dynasty, which
was compiled under the traveller&rsquo;s own supervision, by order of the
great emperor Tai-Tsung; and (b) a Biography of Hsüan Tsang by
two of his contemporaries. 5. The Itinerary of Fifty-six Religious
Travellers, compiled and published under imperial authority, 730.
6. The Itinerary of Khi-Nie, who travelled (964-976) at the head
of a large body of monks to collect books, &amp;c. Neither of the last
two has been translated.


844

Hsüan Tsang was born in the district of Keu-Shi, near Honan-Fu,
about 605, a period at which Buddhism appears to have had
a powerful influence upon a large body of educated Chinese.
From childhood grave and studious, he was taken in charge by an
elder brother who had adopted the monastic life, in a convent at
the royal city of Loyang in Honan. Hsüan Tsang soon followed
his brother&rsquo;s example. For some years he travelled over China,
teaching and learning, and eventually settled for a time at the
capital Chang-gan (now Si-gan-fu in Shensi), where his fame
for learning became great. The desire which he entertained
to visit India, in order to penetrate all the doctrines of the
Buddhist philosophy, and to perfect the collections of Indian
books which existed in China, grew irresistible, and in August
629 he started upon his solitary journey, eluding with difficulty
the strict prohibition which was in force against crossing the
frontier.

The &ldquo;master of the law,&rdquo; as his biographers call him, plunged
alone into the terrible desert of the Gobi, then known as the
Sha-mo or &ldquo;Sand River,&rdquo; between Kwa-chow and Igu (now
Hami or Kamil). At long intervals he found help from the small
garrisons of the towers that dotted the desert track. Very
striking is the description, like that given six centuries later
by Marco Polo, of the quasi-supernatural horrors that beset the
lonely traveller in the wilderness&mdash;the visions of armies and
banners; and the manner in which they are dissipated singularly
recalls passages in Bunyan&rsquo;s Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress. After great
suffering Hsüan Tsang reached Igu, the seat of a Turkish principality,
and pursued his way along the southern foot of the
T&rsquo;ian-shan, which he crossed by a glacier pass (vividly described)
in the longitude of Lake Issyk-kul. In the valley of the Talas
river he encounters the great khan of the Turks on a hunting
party,&mdash;a rencontre which it is interesting to compare with the
visit of Zemarchus to the great khan Dizabul, sixty years before,
in the same region. Passing by the present Tashkend, and by
Samarkand, then inhabited by fire worshippers, he reached the
basin of the Upper Oxus, which had recently been the seat of
the powerful dominion of the Haiathelah, Ephthalites or
White Huns, known in earlier days to the Greeks as Tochari, and
to Hsüan Tsang (by the same name) as Tuholo or Tukh&#257;ra. His
account of the many small states into which the Tukh&#257;ra
empire had broken up is of great interest, as many of them are
identical in name and topography with the high valley states
and districts on the Upper Oxus, which are at this day the object
of so much geographical and political interest.

Passing by Bamian, where he speaks of the great idols still
so famous, he crosses Hindu-Kush, and descends the valley of
the Kabul river to Nagarahara, the site of which, still known
as Nagara, adjoining Jalalabad, has been explored by Mr W.
Simpson. Travelling thence to Peshawar (Purushapura), the
capital of Gandhara, he made a digression, through the now
inaccessible valley of Swat and the Dard states, to the Upper
Indus, returning to Peshawar, and then crossing the Indus (Sintu)
into the decayed kingdom of Taxila (Ta-cha-si-lo, Takshasila),
then subject to Kashmir. In the latter valley he spent two
whole years (631-633) studying in the convents, and visiting
the many monuments of his faith. In his further travels he visited
Mathura (Mot&rsquo;ulo, Muttra), whence he turned north to Thanesar
and the upper Jumna and Ganges, returning south down the
valley of the latter to Kanyakubja or Kanauj, then one of the
great capitals of India. The pilgrim next entered on a circuit
of the most famous sites of Buddhist and of ancient Indian
history, such as Ajodhya, Prayaga (Allahabad), Kausambhi,
Sravasti, Kapilavastu, the birth-place of Sakya, Kusinagara, his
death-place, Pataliputra (Patna, the Palibothra of the Greeks),
Gaya, Rajagriha and Nalanda, the most famous and learned
monastery and college in India, adorned by the gifts of successive
kings, of the splendour of which he gives a vivid description, and
of which traces have recently been recovered. There he again
spent nearly two years in mastering Sanskrit and the depths
of Buddhist philosophy. Again, proceeding down the banks of
the Ganges, he diverged eastward to Kamarupa (Assam), and
then passed by the great ports of Tamralipti (Tamluk, the misplaced
Tamalitis of Ptolemy), and through Orissa to Kanchipara
(Conjeeveram), about 640. Thence he went northward across
the Carnatic and Maharashtra to Barakacheva (Broach of our
day, Barygaza of the Greeks). After this he visited Malwa, Cutch,
Surashtra (peninsular Gujarat, Syrastrene of the Greeks), Sind,
Multan and Ghazni, whence he rejoined his former course in the
basin of the Kabul river.

This time, however, he crosses Pamir, of which he gives a
remarkable account, and passes by Kashgar, Khotan (Kustana),
and the vicinity of Lop-nor across the desert to Kwa-chow,
whence he had made his venturous and lonely plunge into the
waste fifteen years before. He carried with him great collections
of books, precious images and reliques, and was received (April
645) with public and imperial enthusiasm. The emperor T&rsquo;ai-Tsung
desired him to commit his journey to writing, and also
that he should abandon the eremitic rule and serve the state.
This last he declined, and devoted himself to the compilation
of his narrative and the translation of the books he had brought
with him from India. The former was completed A.D. 648. In
664 Hsüan Tsang died in a convent at Chang-gan. Some things
in the history of his last days, and in the indications of beatitude
recorded, strongly recall the parallel history of the saints of the
Roman calendar. But on the other hand we find the Chinese
saint, on the approach of death, causing one of his disciples to
frame a catalogue of his good works, of the books that he had
translated or caused to be transcribed, of the sacred pictures
executed at his cost, of the alms that he had given, of the living
creatures that he had ransomed from death. &ldquo;When Kia-shang
had ended writing this list, the master ordered him to read it aloud.
After hearing it the devotees clasped their hands, and showered
their felicitations on him.&rdquo; Thus the &ldquo;well-done, good and
faithful&rdquo; comes from the servant himself in self-applause.

The book of the biography, by the disciples Hwai-li and
Yen-t&rsquo;sung, as rendered with judicious omissions by Stan.
Julien, is exceedingly interesting; its Chinese style receives
high praise from the translator, who says he has often had to
regret his inability to reproduce its grace, elegance and vivacity.

HUAMBISAS, a tribe of South American Indians on the upper
Marañon and Santiago rivers, Peru. In 1841 they drove all the
civilized Indians from the neighbouring missions. In 1843 they
killed all the inhabitants of the village of Santa Teresa, between
the mouths of the Santiago and Morona. They are fair-skinned
and bearded, sharing with the Jeveros a descent from the Spanish
women captured by their Indian ancestors at the sack of Sevilla
del Oro in 1599.



HUANCAVELICA, a city of central Peru and capital of a
department, 160 m. S.E. of Lima. The city stands in a deep
ravine of the Andes at an elevation of about 12,400 ft. above the
sea, the ravine having an average width of 1 m. Pop. (1906
estimate) 6000. The city is solidly and regularly built, the
houses being of stone and the stream that flows through the
town being spanned by several stone bridges. Near Huancavelica
is the famous quicksilver mine of Santa Barbara, with
its subterranean church of San Rosario, hewn from the native
cinnabar-bearing rock. Huancavelica was founded by Viceroy
Francisco de Toledo in 1572 as a mining town, and mining
continues to be the principal occupation of its inhabitants. The
845
department is traversed by the Cordillera Occidental, and is
bounded N., E. and S. by Junin and Ayacucho. Pop. (1906
official estimate) 167,840; area, 9254 sq. m. The principal
industry is mining for silver and quicksilver. The best-known
silver mines are the Castrovirreyna.



HUÁNUCO, a city of central Peru, capital of a department,
170 m. N.N.E. of Lima in a beautiful valley on the left bank of
the Huallaga river, nearly 6000 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1906
estimate) about 6000. The town was founded in 1539 by Gomez
Alvarado. Huánuco is celebrated for its fruits and sweetmeats,
the &ldquo;chirimoya&rdquo; (Anona chirimolia) of this region being the
largest and most delicious of its kind. Mining is one of the city&rsquo;s
industries. Huánuco was the scene of one of the bloodthirsty
massacres of which the Chileans were guilty during their occupation
of Peruvian territory in 1881-1883. The department of
Huánuco lies immediately N. of Junin, with Ancachs on the W.
and San Martin and Loreto on the N. and E. Pop. (1906
estimate) 108,980; area, 14,028 sq. m. It lies wholly in the
Cordillera region, and is traversed from S. to N. by the Marañon
and Huallaga rivers.



HUARAZ, a city of northern Peru and capital o£ the department
of Ancachs, on the left bank of the Huaraz, or Santa river, about
190 m. N.N.W. of Lima and 58 m. from the coast. Pop. (1876)
4851, (1906 estimate) 6000. Huaraz is situated in a narrow
fertile valley of the Western Cordillera, at a considerable elevation
above sea-level, and has a mild climate. A railway projected
to connect Huaraz with the port of Chimbote, on the Bay of
Chimbote, a few miles S. of the mouth of the Santa river, was
completed from Chimbote to Suchimán (33 m.) in 1872, when
work was suspended for want of money. In the valley of the
Huaraz cattle are raised, and wheat, sugar and fruit, gold, silver,
copper and coal are produced. Alfalfa is grown by stock-raisers,
and the cattle raised here are among the best in the Peruvian
market. In the vicinity of Huaraz are megalithic ruins similar
to those of Tiahunaco and Cuzco, showing that the aboriginal
empire preceding the Incas extended into northern Peru.



HUARTE DE SAN JUAN, or Huarte Y Navarro, Juan
(c. 1530-1592), Spanish physician and psychologist, was born at
Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port (Lower Navarre) about 1530, was
educated at the university of Huesca, where he graduated in
medicine, and, though it appears doubtful whether he practised
as a physician at Huesca, distinguished himself by his professional
skill and heroic zeal during the plague which devastated Baeza
in 1566. He died in 1592. His Examen de ingenios para las
ciencias (1575) won him a European reputation, and was translated
by Lessing. Though now superseded, Huarte&rsquo;s treatise is
historically interesting as the first attempt to show the connexion
between psychology and physiology, and its acute
ingenuity is as remarkable as the boldness of its views.



HUASTECS, a tribe of North American Indians of Mayan
stock, living to the north of Vera Cruz. They are of interest to the
ethnologist as being so entirely detached from the other Mayan
tribes of Central America. The theory is that the Mayas came
from the north and that the Huastecs were left behind in the
migration southward.



HUBER, FRANÇOIS (1750-1831), Swiss naturalist, was born
at Geneva on the 2nd of July 1750. He belonged to a family
which had already made its mark in the literary and scientific
world: his great-aunt, Marie Huber (1695-1753), was known as
a voluminous writer on religious and theological subjects, and
as the translator and epitomizer of the Spectator (Amsterdam,
3 vols., 1753); and his father Jean Huber (1721-1786), who had
served for many years as a soldier, was a prominent member of
the coterie at Ferney, distinguishing himself by his Observations
sur le vol des oiseaux (Geneva, 1784). François Huber was only
fifteen years old when he began to suffer from an affection of the
eyes which gradually resulted in total blindness; but, with the
aid of his wife, Marie Aimée Lullin, and of his servant, François
Burnens, he was able to carry out investigations that laid the
foundations of our scientific knowledge of the life history of the
honey-bee. His Nouvelles Observations sur les abeilles was published
at Geneva in 1792 (Eng. trans., 1806). He assisted Jean
Senebier in his Mém. sur l&rsquo;influence de l&rsquo;air, &amp;c., dans la germination
(Geneva, 1800); and he also wrote &ldquo;Mém. sur l&rsquo;origine de la
cire&rdquo; (Bibliothèque britannique, tome xxv.), a &ldquo;Lettre à M.
Pictet sur certains dangers que courent les abeilles&rdquo; (Bib.
brit. xxvii), and &ldquo;Nouvelles Observ. rel. au sphinx Atropos&rdquo;
(Bib. brit. xxvii). He died at Lausanne on the 22nd of December
1831. De Candolle gave his name to a genus of Brazilian trees&mdash;Huberia
laurina.

Pierre Huber (1777-1840) followed in his father&rsquo;s footsteps.
His best-known work is Recherches sur les m&oelig;urs des fourmis
indigènes (Geneva and Paris, 1810; new ed., Geneva, 1861), and
he also wrote various papers on entomological subjects.


See the account of François Huber, by De Candolle, in Bibl.
universelle (1832); and the notice of Pierre in Bibl. univ. (1886);

HUBER, JOHANN NEPOMUK (1830-1879), German philosophical
and theological writer, a leader of the Old Catholics,
was born at Munich on the 18th of August 1830. Originally
destined for the priesthood, he early began the study of theology.
By the writings of Spinoza and Oken, however, he was strongly
drawn to philosophical pursuits, and it was in philosophy that
he &ldquo;habilitated&rdquo; (1854) in the university of his native place,
where he ultimately became professor (extraordinarius, 1859;
ordinarius, 1864). With Döllinger and others he attracted a
large amount of public attention in 1869 by the challenge to the
Ultramontane promoters of the Vatican council in the treatise
Der Papst und das Koncil, which appeared under the pseudonym
of &ldquo;Janus,&rdquo; and also in 1870 by a series of letters (Römische
Briefe, a redaction of secret reports sent from Rome during the
sitting of the council), which were published over the pseudonym
Quirinus in the Allgemeine Zeitung. He died suddenly of heart
disease at Munich on the 20th of March 1879.

Works.&mdash;The treatise Über die Willensfreiheit (1858), followed in
1859 by Die Philosophie der Kirchenväter, which was promptly
placed upon the Index, and led to the prohibition of all Catholic
students from attending his lectures; Johannes Scotus Erigena
(1861); Die Idee der Unsterblichkeit (1864); Studien (1867); Der
Proletarier; zur Orientirung in der sozialen Frage (1865); Der
Jesuitenorden nach seiner Verfassung und Doctrin, Wirksamkeit und
Geschichte (1873), also placed upon the Index; Der Pessimismus
(1876); Die Forschung nach der Materie (1877); Zur Philosophie
der Astronomie (1878); Das Gedächtnis (1878). He also published
adverse criticisms of Darwin, Strauss, Hartmann and Häckel;
pamphlets on Das Papsttum und der Staat (1870), and on Die Freiheiten
der französischen Kirche (1871); and a volume of Kleine
Schriften (1871).

Allgemeine deutsche Biographie, xiii. (1881), and in Nord und Süd
(1879).



HUBER, LUDWIG FERDINAND (1764-1804), German author,
was born in Paris on the 14th of September 1764, the son of
Michael Huber (1727-1804), who did much to promote the
study of German literature in France. In his infancy young
Huber removed with his parents to Leipzig, where he was
carefully instructed in modern languages and literature, and
showed a particular inclination for those of France and England.
In Leipzig he became intimate with Christian Gottfried Körner,
father of the poet; in Dresden Huber became engaged to Dora
Stock, sister of Körner&rsquo;s betrothed, and associated with Schiller,
who was one of Körner&rsquo;s stanchest friends. In 1787 he was
appointed secretary to the Saxon legation in Mainz, where he
remained until the French occupation of 1792. While here he
interested himself for the welfare of the family of his friend
Georg Forster, who, favouring republican views, had gone to
Paris, leaving his wife Therese Forster (1764-1829) and family
in destitute circumstances. Huber, enamoured of the talented
young wife, gave up his diplomatic post, broke off his engagement
to Dora Stock, removed with the Forster family to Switzerland,
and on the death of her husband in 1794 married Therese Forster.
In 1798 Huber took over the editorship of the Allgemeine Zeitung
in Stuttgart. The newspaper having been prohibited in Württemberg,
Huber continued its editorship in Ulm in 1803. He was
created &ldquo;counsellor of education&rdquo; for the new Bavarian province
of Swabia in the following year, but had hardly entered upon
the functions of his new office when he died on the 24th of
December 1804.

846

Huber was well versed in English literature, and in 1785 he
published the drama Ethelwolf, with notes on Beaumont and
Fletcher and the old English stage. He also wrote many dramas,
comedies and tragedies, most of which are now forgotten, and
among them only Das heimliche Gericht (1790, new ed. 1795)
enjoyed any degree of popularity. As a critic he is seen to
advantage in the Vermischte Schriften von dem Verfasser des
heimlichen Gerichts (2 vols., 1793). As a publicist he made his
name in the historical-political periodicals Friedenspräliminarien
(1794-1796, 10 vols.) and Klio (1795-1798, 1819).


His collected works, Sämtliche Werke seit dem Jahre 1802 (4 vols.,
1807-1819), were published with a biography by his wife Therese
Huber. See L. Speidel and H. Wittmann, Bilder aus der Schiller-Zeit
(1884).




HUBERT (Hucbertus, Hugbertus), ST (d. 727), bishop of
Liége, whose festival is celebrated on the 3rd of November.
The Bollandists have published seven different lives of the
saint. The first is the only one of any value, and is the work
of a contemporary. Unfortunately, it is very sparing of details.
In it we see that Hubert in 708 succeeded Lambert in the see
of Maestricht (Tongres), and that he erected a basilica to his
memory. In 825 Hubert&rsquo;s remains were removed to a Benedictine
cloister in the Ardennes, which thenceforth bore his
name (St Hubert, province of Luxemburg, Belgium), and ultimately
became a considerable resort of pilgrims. The later
legends (Bibliotheca hagiographica latina, nos. 3994-4002) are
devoid of authority. One of them relates, probably following
the legend of St Eustace, the miracle of the conversion of St
Hubert. This conversion, represented as having been brought
about while he was hunting on Good Friday by a miraculous
appearance of a stag bearing between his horns a cross or crucifix
surrounded with rays of light, has frequently been made the
subject of artistic treatment. He is the patron of hunters, and
is also invoked in cases of hydrophobia. Several orders of
knighthood have been under his protection; among these may
be mentioned the Bavarian, the Bohemian and that of the
electorate of Cologne.

HUBERTUSBURG, a château in the kingdom of Saxony,
near the village of Wermsdorf and midway 6 m. between the
towns Oschatz and Grimma. It was built in 1721-1724 by
Frederick Augustus II., elector of Saxony, subsequently King
Augustus III. of Poland, as a hunting box, and was often the
scene of brilliant festivities. It is famous for the peace signed
here on the 15th of February 1763, which ended the Seven Years&rsquo;
War. After undergoing various vicissitudes, it now serves the
purpose of a lunatic asylum and a training school for nursing
sisters.


See Riemer, Das Schloss Hubertusburg, sonst und jetzt (Oschatz,
1881).




HUBLI, a town of British India, in the Dharwar district of
Bombay, 15 m. S.E. of Dharwar town. Pop. (1901) 60,214.
It is a railway junction on the Southern Mahratta system,
where the lines to Bangalore and Bezwada branch off south and
west. It is an important centre of trade and of cotton and silk
weaving, and has two cotton mills and several factories for
ginning and pressing cotton. Hubli was in early times the seat
of an English factory, which, with the rest of the town, was
plundered in 1673 by Sivaji, the Mahratta leader.



HÜBNER, EMIL (1834-1901), German classical scholar, son
of the historical painter Julius Hübner (1806-1882), was born at
Düsseldorf on the 7th of July 1834. After studying at Berlin
and Bonn, he travelled extensively with a view to antiquarian
and epigraphical researches. The results of these travels were
embodied in several important works: Inscriptiones Hispaniae
Latinae (1869, supplement 1892), I. H. Christianae (1871, supplement
1900); Inscriptiones Britanniae Latinae (1873), I. B.
Christianae (1876); La Arqueologia de España (1888); Monumenta
linguae Hibericae (1893). Hübner was also the author
of two books of the greatest utility to the classical student:
Grundriss zu Vorlesungen über die römische Literaturgeschichte
(4th ed. 1878, edited, with large additions, by J. E. B. Mayor as
Bibliographical Clue to Latin Literature, 1875), and Bibliographie
der classischen Altertumswissenschaft (2nd ed., 1889); mention
may also be made of Römische Epigraphik (2nd ed., 1892);
Exempla Scripturae Epigraphicae Latinae (1885); and Römische
Herrschaft in Westeuropa (1890). In 1870 Hübner was appointed
professor of Classical Philology in the university of Berlin,
where he died on the 21st of February 1901.



HÜBNER, JOSEPH ALEXANDER, Count (1811-1892),
Austrian diplomatist, was born in Vienna on the 26th of
November 1811. His real name was Hafenbredl, which he afterwards
changed to Hübner. He began his public career in 1833
under Metternich, whose confidence he soon gained, and who
sent him in 1837 as attaché to Paris. In 1841 he became secretary
of embassy at Lisbon, and in 1844 Austrian consul-general at
Leipzig. In 1848 he was sent to Milan to conduct the diplomatic
correspondence of Archduke Rainer, viceroy of Lombardy.
On the outbreak of the revolution he was seized as a hostage,
and remained a prisoner for some months. Returning to Austria,
he was entrusted with the compilation of the documents and proclamations
relating to the abdication of the Emperor Ferdinand
and the accession of Francis Joseph. His journal, an invaluable
clue to the complicated intrigues of this period, was published
in 1891 in French and German, under the title of Une Année
de ma vie, 1848-1849. In March 1849 he was sent on a special
mission to Paris, and later in the same year was appointed
ambassador to France. To his influence was in large measure
due the friendly attitude of Austria to the Allies in the Crimean
War, at the close of which he represented Austria at the congress
of Paris in 1856. He allowed himself, however, to be taken by
surprise by Napoleon&rsquo;s intervention on behalf of Italian unity,
of which the first public intimation was given by the French
emperor&rsquo;s cold reception of Hübner on New Year&rsquo;s Day, 1859,
with the famous words: &ldquo;I regret that our relations with your
Government are not so good as they have hitherto been.&rdquo; He
did not return to Paris after the war, and after holding the
ministry of police in the Goluchowski cabinet from August to
October 1859, lived in retirement till 1865, when he became
ambassador at Rome. Quitting this post in 1867, he undertook
extensive travels, his descriptions of which appeared as Promenade
autour du monde, 1871 (1873; English translation by Lady
Herbert, 1874) and Through the British Empire (1886). Written
in a bright and entertaining style, and characterized by shrewd
observation, they achieved considerable popularity in their
time. A more serious effort was his Sixte-Quint (1870, translated
into English by H. E. H. Jerningham under the title of
The Life and Times of Sixtus the Fifth, 1872), an original contribution
to the history of the period, based on unpublished documents
at the Vatican, Simancas and Venice. In 1879 he was made
a life-member of the Austrian Upper House, where he sat as a
Clerical and Conservative. He had received the rank of Baron
(Freiherr) in 1854, and in 1888 was raised to the higher rank of
Count (Graf). He died at Vienna on the 30th of July 1892.
Though himself of middle-class origin, he was a profound admirer
of the old aristocratic régime, and found his political ideals in
his former chiefs, Metternich and Schwarzenberg. As the last
survivor of the Metternich school, he became towards the close
of his life more and more out of touch with the trend of modern
politics, but remained a conspicuous figure in the Upper House
and at the annual delegations. That he possessed the breadth
of mind to appreciate the working of a system at total variance
with his own school of thought was shown by his grasp of British
colonial questions. It is interesting, in view of subsequent
events, to note his emphatic belief in the loyalty of the British
colonies&mdash;a belief not shared at that time by many statesmen
with far greater experience of democratic institutions.

HUC, ÉVARISTE RÉGIS (1813-1860), French missionary-traveller,
was born at Toulouse, on the 1st of August 1813. In
his twenty-fourth year he entered the congregation of the
Lazarists at Paris, and shortly after receiving holy orders in
847
1839 went out to China. At Macao he spent some eighteen
months in the Lazarist seminary, preparing himself for the
regular work of a missionary. Having acquired some command
of the Chinese tongue, and modified his personal appearance
and dress in accordance with Chinese taste, he started from
Canton. He at first superintended a Christian mission in the
southern provinces, and then passing to Peking, where he perfected
his knowledge of the language, eventually settled in the
Valley of Black Waters or He Shuy, a little to the north of the
capital, and just within the borders of Mongolia. There, beyond
the Great Wall, a large but scattered population of native
Christians had found a refuge from the persecutions of Kia-King,
to be united half a century later in a vast but vague
apostolic vicariate. The assiduity with which Huc devoted
himself to the study of the dialects and customs of the Tatars,
for whom at the cost of much labour he translated various
religious works, was an admirable preparation for undertaking
in 1844, at the instigation of the vicar apostolic of Mongolia,
an expedition whose object was to dissipate the obscurity which
hung over the country and habits of the Tibetans. September
of that year found the missionary at Dolon Nor occupied with
the final arrangements for his journey, and shortly afterwards,
accompanied by his fellow-Lazarist, Joseph Gabet, and a young
Tibetan priest who had embraced Christianity, he set out. To
escape attention the little party assumed the dress of lamas
or priests. Crossing the Hwang-ho, they advanced into the
terrible sandy tract known as the Ordos Desert. After suffering
dreadfully from want of water and fuel they entered Kansu,
having recrossed the flooded Hwang-ho, but it was not till
January 1845 that they reached Tang-Kiul on the boundary.
Rather than encounter alone the horrors of a four months&rsquo;
journey to Lhasa they resolved to wait for eight months till
the arrival of a Tibetan embassy on its return from Peking.
Under an intelligent teacher they meanwhile studied the Tibetan
language and Buddhist literature, and during three months
of their stay they resided in the famous Kunbum Lamasery,
which was reported to accommodate 4000 persons. Towards
the end of September they joined the returning embassy, which
comprised 2000 men and 3700 animals. Crossing the deserts
of Koko Nor, they passed the great lake of that name, with its
island of contemplative lamas, and, following a difficult and
tortuous track across snow-covered mountains, they at last
entered Lhasa on the 29th of January 1846. Favourably received
by the regent, they opened a little chapel, and were in a fair way
to establish an important mission, when the Chinese ambassador
interfered and had the two missionaries conveyed back to Canton,
where they arrived in October of the same year. For nearly
three years Huc remained at Canton, but Gabet, returning to
Europe, proceeded thence to Rio de Janeiro, and died there
shortly afterwards. Huc returned to Europe in shattered
health in 1852, visiting India, Egypt and Palestine on his way,
and, after a prolonged residence in Paris, died on the 31st of
March 1860.


His writings comprise, besides numerous letters and memoirs
in the Annales de la propagation de la foi, the famous Souvenirs d&rsquo;un
voyage dans la Tartarie, le Thibet, et la Chine pendant les années
1844-1846 (2 vols., Paris, 1850; Eng. trans. by W. Hazlitt, 1851,
abbreviated by M. Jones, London, 1867); its supplement, crowned
by the Academy, entitled L&rsquo;Empire chinois (2 vols., Paris, 1854;
Eng. trans., London, 1859); and an elaborate historical work, Le
Christianisme en Chine, &amp;c. (4 vols., Paris, 1857-1858; Eng. trans.,
London, 1857-1858). These works are written in a lucid, racy,
picturesque style, which secured for them an unusual degree of
popularity. The Souvenirs is a narrative of a remarkable feat of
travel, and contains passages of so singular a character as in the
absence of corroborative testimony to stir up a feeling of incredulity.
That Huc was suspected unjustly was amply proved by later research.
But he was by no means a practical geographer, and
the record of his travels loses greatly in value from the want of
precise scientific data.

See, for information specially relating to the whole subject, the
Abbé Desgodin&rsquo;s Mission du Thibet de 1855 à 1870 (Verdun, 1872);
and &ldquo;Account of the Pundit&rsquo;s Journey in Great Tibet,&rdquo; in the
Royal Geographical Society&rsquo;s Journal for 1877.




HUCBALD (Hugbaldus, Hubaldus), Benedictine monk, and
writer on music, was born at the monastery of Saint Amand
near Tournai, in or about 840, if we may believe the statement of
his biographers to the effect that he died in 930, aged 90. He
studied at the monastery, where his uncle Milo occupied an
important position. Hucbald made rapid progress in the
acquirement of various sciences and arts, including that of music,
and at an early age composed a hymn in honour of St Andrew,
which met with such success as to excite the jealousy of his uncle.
It is said that Hucbald in consequence was compelled to leave
St Amand, and started an independent school of music and other
arts at Nevers. In 860, however, he was at St Germain d&rsquo;Auxerre,
bent upon completing his studies, and in 872 he was back again
at St Amand as the successor in the headmastership of the
convent school of his uncle, to whom he had been reconciled in
the meantime. Between 883 and 900 Hucbald went on several
missions of reforming and reconstructing various schools of
music, including that of Rheims, but in the latter year he returned
to St Amand, where he remained to the day of his death
on the 25th of June 930, or, according to other chroniclers,
on the 20th of June 932. The only work which can positively
be ascribed to him is his Harmonica Institutio. The Musica
Enchiriadis, published with other writings of minor importance
in Gerbert&rsquo;s Scriptores de Musica, and containing a complete
system of musical science as well as instructions regarding
notation, has now been proved to have originated about half a
century later than the death of the monk Hucbald, and to have
been the work of an unknown writer belonging to the close of the
10th century and possibly also bearing the name of Hucbald.
This work is celebrated chiefly for an essay on a new form
of notation described in the present day as Dasia Notation.
The author of the Harmonica Institutio wrote numerous lives
of the saints and a curious poem on bald men, dedicated to
Charles the Bald.

HU-CHOW-FU, a city of China, in the province of Cheh-Kiang
(30° 48&prime; N., 120° 3&prime; E.), a little S. of Tai-hu Lake, in the
midst of the central silk district. According to Chinese authorities
it is 6 m. in circumference, and contains about 100,000 families.
A broad stream or canal crosses the city from south to north,
and forms the principal highway for boat traffic. The main
trade of the place is in raw silk, but some silk fabrics, such as
flowered crape (chousha), are also manufactured. Silk is largely
worn even by the lowest classes of the inhabitants.



HUCHOWN, &ldquo;of the Awle Ryale&rdquo; (fl. 14th century), Scottish
poet, is referred to by Wyntoun in his Chronicle in these words:&mdash;

 
                        &ldquo;Hucheon,
þat cunnande was in littratur.
He made a gret Gest of Arthure,
And þe Awntyr of Gawane,
Þe Pistil als of Suet Susane.
He was curyousse in his stille,
Fayr of facunde and subtile,
And ay to pleyssance hade delyte,
Mad in metyr meit his dyte
Litil or noucht neuir þe lesse
Wauerande fra þe suythfastnes.&rdquo;
      (Cott. MS. bk. v. II, 4308-4318).
 

Much critical ingenuity has been spent in endeavouring to
identify (a) the poet and (b) the works named in the foregoing
passage. It has been assumed that &ldquo;Huchown,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hucheon,&rdquo;
represents the &ldquo;gude Sir Hew of Eglyntoun&rdquo; named by Dunbar
(q.v.) in his Lament for the Makaris (i. 53). The only known
Sir Hugh of Eglintoun of the century is frequently mentioned
in the public records from the middle of the century onwards,
as an auditor of accounts and as witness to several charters.
By 1360 he had married Dame Egidia, widow of Sir James
Lindsay and half-sister of Robert the Steward. His public
office and association with the Steward sorts well with the
designation &ldquo;of the Awle Ryale,&rdquo; if that be interpreted as
&ldquo;Aula Regalis&rdquo; or &ldquo;Royal Palace.&rdquo; He appears to have died
late in 1376 or early in 1377.

848

The first of the poems named above, the Gest of Arthure or
Gest Historyalle (ib. i. 4288), has been identified by Dr Trautmann,
&ldquo;Anglia,&rdquo; Der Dichter Huchown (1877), with the alliterative
Morte Arthure in the Thornton MS. at Lincoln, printed by the
E.E.T.S. (ed. Brock, 1865). The problem of the second (The
Awntyr of Gawane) is still in dispute. There are difficulties in
the way of accepting the conjecture that the poem is the &ldquo;Awntyres
of Arthure at the Tern Wathelyne&rdquo; (see S.T.S., Scottish
Alliterative Poems, 1897, and Introduction, pp. 11 et seq.), and
little direct evidence in favour of the view that the reference is
to the greatest of middle English romances, Sir Gawain and
the Grene Knight. The third may be safely accepted as the
well-known Pistil [Epistle] of Swete Susan, printed by Laing
(Select Remains, 1822) and by the S.T.S. (Scottish Alliterative
Poems, u.s.).

of Eglintoun and Huchown of the Awle Ryale (Glasgow, 1901), which

Eglintoun; Huchown of the Awle Ryale, the Alliterative Poet

HUCHTENBURG, the name of two brothers who were Dutch
painters in the second half of the 17th century. Both were natives
of Haarlem. Jacob, the elder, of whom very little is known,
studied under Berghem, and went early to Italy, where he
died young about 1667. His pictures are probably confounded
with those of his brother. In Copenhagen, where alone they are
catalogued, they illustrate the style of a Dutchman who transfers
Berghem&rsquo;s cattle and flocks to Italian landscapes and marketplaces.

John van Huchtenburg (1646-1733), born at Haarlem it is
said in 1646, was first taught by Thomas Wyk, and afterwards
induced to visit the chief cities of Italy, where, penetrating as
far as Rome, he met and dwelt with his brother Jacob. After
the death of the latter he wandered homewards, taking Paris on
his way, and served under Van der Meulen, then employed in
illustrating for Louis XIV. the campaign of 1667-1668 in the
Low Countries. In 1670 he settled at Haarlem, where he married,
practised and kept a dealer&rsquo;s shop. His style had now merged
into an imitation of Philip Wouvermans and Van der Meulen,
which could not fail to produce pretty pictures of hunts and
robber camps, the faculty of painting horses and men in action
and varied dress being the chief point of attraction. Later
Huchtenburg ventured on cavalry skirmishes and engagements
of regular troops generally, and these were admired by Prince
Eugene and William III., who gave the painter sittings, and
commissioned him to throw upon canvas the chief incidents of
the battles they fought upon the continent of Europe. When
he died at Amsterdam in 1733, Huchtenburg had done much by
his pictures and prints to make Prince Eugene, King William
and Marlborough popular. Though clever in depicting a mêlée
or a skirmish of dragoons, he remained second to Philip Wouvermans
in accuracy of drawing, and inferior to Van der Meulen in
the production of landscapes. But, nevertheless, he was a clever
and spirited master, with great facility of hand and considerable
natural powers of observation.


The earliest date on his pictures is 1674, when he executed the
&ldquo;Stag-Hunt&rdquo; in the Museum of Berlin, and the &ldquo;Fight with Robbers&rdquo;
in the Lichtenstein collection at Vienna. A &ldquo;Skirmish at Fleurus&rdquo;
(1690) in the Brussels gallery seems but the precursor of larger and
more powerful works, such as the &ldquo;Siege of Namur&rdquo; (1695) in the
Belvedere at Vienna, where William III. is seen in the foreground
accompanied by Max Emmanuel, the Bavarian elector. Three
years before, Huchtenburg had had sittings from Prince Eugene
(Hague museum) and William III. (Amsterdam Trippenhuis).
After 1696 he regularly served as court painter to Prince Eugene,
and we have at Turin (gallery) a series of eleven canvases all of the
same size depicting the various battles of the great hero, commencing
with the fight of Zentha against the Turks in 1697, and concluding
with the capture of Belgrade in 1717. Had the duke of
Marlborough been fond of art he would doubtless have possessed
many works of our artist. All that remains at Blenheim, however,
is a couple of sketches of battles, which were probably sent to
Churchill by his great contemporary. The pictures of Huchtenburg
are not very numerous now in public galleries. There is one in the
National Gallery, London, another at the Louvre. But Copenhagen
has four, Dresden six, Gotha two, and Munich has the well-known
composition of &ldquo;Tallart taken Prisoner at Blenheim in 1704.&rdquo;








HUCKABACK,1 the name given to a type of cloth used for
towels. For this purpose it has perhaps been more extensively
used in the linen trade than any other weave. One of the chief
merits of a towel is its capacity for absorbing moisture; plain
and other flat-surfaced cloths do not perform this function
satisfactorily, but cloths made with huckaback, as well as
those made with the honeycomb and similar weaves, are particularly
well adapted for this purpose.
The body or foundation of the cloth
is plain and therefore sound in structure
(see designs A and B in figure),
but at fixed intervals some of the
warp threads float on the surface of
the cloth, while at the same time a number of weft threads
float on the back. Thus the cloth has a somewhat similar
appearance on both sides. Weave A is the ordinary and most
used huck or huckaback, while weave B, which is usually
woven with double weft, is termed the Devon or medical huck.
The cloths made by the use of these weaves were originally all
linen, but are too often adulterated with inferior fibres.

 

1 Skeat, Etym. Dict. (1898), says, &ldquo;The word bears so remarkable
resemblance to Low Ger. hukkebak, Ger. huckeback, pick-a-back, that
it seems reasonable to suppose that it at first meant &lsquo;peddler&rsquo;s
ware.&rsquo;&rdquo; The New English Dictionary does not consider that the
connexion can at present be assumed.




HUCKLEBERRY, in botany, the popular name in the north-eastern
United States of the genus Gaylussacia, small branching
shrubs resembling in habit the English bilberry (Vaccinium),
to which it is closely allied, and bearing a similar fruit. The
common huckleberry of the northern states is G. resinosa;
while G. brachycera and G. dumosa are known respectively as
box and dwarf huckleberry. The name Gaylussacia commemorates
the famous French chemist Gay-Lussac.



HUCKNALL TORKARD, a town in the Rushcliffe parliamentary
division of Nottinghamshire, England; 132 m. N.N.W.
from London by the Great Central railway, served also by the
Great Northern and Midland railways. Pop. (1901) 15,250.
The church of St Mary Magdalene contains the tomb of Lord
Byron. There are extensive collieries in the vicinity, and the
town has tobacco and hosiery works. Small traces are found
of Beauvale Abbey, a Carthusian foundation of the 14th century,
in the hilly, wooded district W. of Hucknall; and 3 m. N. is
Newstead Abbey, in a beautiful situation on the border of
Sherwood Forest. This Augustinian foundation owed its
origin to Henry II. It came into the hands of the Byron family
in 1540, and the poet Byron resided in it at various times until
1818. There remain the Early English west front of the church,
a Perpendicular cloister and the chapter-house; while in the
mansion, wholly restored since Byron&rsquo;s time, and in the demesne,
many relics of the poet are preserved. To the S. of Hucknall are
traces of Gresley Castle, of the 14th century.



HUCKSTER, a dealer or retailer of goods in a small way.
The word, in various forms, is common to many Teutonic
languages. In Early English it is found as howkester, hokester,
huxter; in early modern Dutch as heuker, and Medieval Low
German as hoker; but the ultimate origin is unknown. Huckster
apparently belongs to that series of words formed from a verb,&mdash;as
brew, brewer; but the noun &ldquo;huckster&rdquo; is found in use
before the verb to huck. Hawker and pedlar are nearly synonymous
in meaning, but &ldquo;huckster&rdquo; may include a person in a small
way of trade in a settled habitation, while a hawker or pedlar
invariably travels from place to place offering his wares. In
a contemptuous sense, huckster is used of any one who barters,
or makes gain or profit in underhand or mean ways, or who
over-reaches another, to get advantage for himself.



HUDDERSFIELD, a municipal, county and parliamentary
borough in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, 190 m.
N.N.W. from London. Pop. (1901) 95,047. It is served
by the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire and London &amp; North Western
849
railways, and has connexion with all the important railway
systems of the West Riding, and with the extensive canal
system of Lancashire and Yorkshire. It is well situated on a
slope above the river Colne, a tributary of the Calder. It is
built principally of stone, and contains several handsome streets
with numerous great warehouses and business premises, many
of which are of high architectural merit. Of the numerous
churches and chapels all are modern, and some of considerable
beauty. The parish church of St Peter, however, though rebuilt
in 1837, occupies a site which is believed to have carried a church
since the 11th century. The town hall (1880) and the corporation
offices (1877) are handsome classic buildings; the Ramsden
Estate buildings are a very fine block of the mixed Italian
order. The market hall (1880) surmounted by a clock-tower
is in geometrical Decorated style. The cloth-hall dates from
1784, when it was erected as a clothiers&rsquo; emporium. It is no
longer used for any such purpose, but serves as an exchange
news-room. The Armoury, erected as a riding-school, was the
headquarters of a volunteer corps, and is also used for concerts
and public meetings. The chief educational establishments
are the Huddersfield College (1838), a higher-grade school,
the technical school and several grammar-schools, of which
Longwood school was founded in 1731. The Literary and
Scientific Society possesses a museum. Of the numerous
charitable institutions, the Infirmary, erected in 1831, is housed
in a building of the Doric order. The chief open spaces are
Greenhead and Beaumont parks, the last named presented to
the town by Mr H. F. Beaumont in 1880. There is a sulphurous
spa in the district of Lockwood.

Huddersfield is the principal seat of the fancy woollen trade
in England, and fancy goods in silk and cotton are also produced
in great variety. Plain cloth and worsteds are also manufactured.
There are silk and cotton spinning-mills, iron foundries and
engineering works. Coal is abundant in the vicinity. The
parliamentary borough returns one member. The county
borough was created in 1888. The municipal borough is under
a mayor, 15 aldermen and 45 councillors. Area, 11,859 acres.

Huddersfield (Oderesfelte) only rose to importance after the
introduction of the woollen trade in the 17th century. After
the Conquest William I. granted the manor to Ilbert de Laci,
of whom the Saxon tenant Godwin was holding as underlord at
the time of the Domesday Survey. In Saxon times it had been
worth l00s., but after being laid waste by the Normans was
still of no value in 1086. From the Lacys the manor passed to
Thomas Plantagenet, duke of Lancaster, through his marriage
with Alice de Lacy, and so came to the crown on the accession
of Henry IV. In 1599 Queen Elizabeth sold it to William
Ramsden, whose descendants still own it. Charles II. in 1670
granted to John Ramsden a market in Huddersfield every
Wednesday with the toll and other profits belonging. By the
beginning of the 18th century Huddersfield had become a
&ldquo;considerable town,&rdquo; chiefly owing to the manufacture of
woollen kersies, and towards the end of the same century the
trade was increased by two events&mdash;the opening of navigation
on the Calder in 1780, and in 1784 that of the cloth-hall or
piece-hall, built and given to the town by Sir John Ramsden,
baronet. Since 1832 the burgesses have returned members to
parliament. The town possesses no charter before 1868, when
it was created a municipal borough.



HUDSON, GEORGE (1800-1871), English railway financier,
known as the &ldquo;railway king,&rdquo; was born in York in March 1800.
Apprenticed to a firm of linendrapers in that city, he soon
became a successful merchant, and in 1837 was elected lord
mayor of York. Having inherited, in 1827, a sum of £30,000,
he invested it in North Midland Railway shares, and was shortly
afterwards appointed a director. In 1833 he had founded and
for some time acted as manager of the York Banking Company.
He had for long been impressed with the necessity of getting
the railway to York, and he took an active part in securing the
passing of the York and North Midland Bill, and was elected
chairman of the new company&mdash;the line being opened in 1839.
From this time he turned his undivided attention to the projection
of railways. In 1841 he initiated the Newcastle and Darlington
line. With George Stephenson he planned and carried out
the extension of the Midland to Newcastle, and by 1844 had
over a thousand miles of railway under his control. In this year
the mania for railway speculation was at its height, and no
man was more courted than the &ldquo;railway king.&rdquo; All classes
delighted to honour him, and, as if a colossal fortune were an
insufficient reward for his public services, the richest men in
England presented him with a tribute of £20,000. Deputy-lieutenant
for Durham, and thrice lord mayor of York, he was
returned in the Conservative interest for Sunderland in 1845,
the event being judged of such public interest that the news
was conveyed to London by a special train, which travelled part
of the way at the rate of 75 m. an hour. Full of rewards and
honours, he was suddenly ruined by the disclosure of the Eastern
Railway frauds. Sunderland clung to her generous representative
till 1859, but on the bursting of the bubble he had lost
influence and fortune at a single stroke. His later life was
chiefly spent on the continent, where he benefited little by a
display of unabated energy and enterprise. Some friends gave
him a small annuity a short time before his death, which took
place in London, on the 14th of December 1871. His name
has long been used to point the moral of vaulting ambition and
unstable fortune. The &ldquo;big swollen gambler,&rdquo; as Carlyle calls
him in one of the Latter-Day Pamphlets, was savagely and
excessively reprobated by the world which had blindly believed
in his golden prophecies. He certainly ruined scrip-holders,
and disturbed the great centres of industry; but he had an
honest faith in his own schemes, and, while he beggared himself
in their promotion, he succeeded in overcoming the powerful
landed interest which delayed the adoption of railways in
England long after the date of their regular introduction into
America.



HUDSON, HENRY, English navigator and explorer. Nothing
is known of his personal history excepting such as falls within
the period of the four voyages on which his fame rests. The
first of these voyages in quest of new trade and a short route
to China by way of the North Pole, in accordance with the suggestion
of Robert Thorne (d. 1527), was made for the Muscovy
Company with ten men and a boy in 1607. Hudson first coasted
the east side of Greenland, and being prevented from proceeding
northwards by the great ice barrier which stretches thence to
Spitzbergen sailed along it until he reached &ldquo;Newland,&rdquo; as Spitzbergen
was then called, and followed its northern coast to beyond
80° N. lat. On the homeward voyage he accidentally discovered
an island in lat. 71° which he named Hudson&rsquo;s Touches, and
which has since been identified with Jan Mayen Island.
Molineux&rsquo;s chart, published by Hakluyt about 1600, was Hudson&rsquo;s
blind guide in this voyage, and the polar map of 1611 by
Pontanus illustrates well what he attempted, and the valuable
results both negative and positive which he reached. He investigated
the trade prospects at Bear Island, and recommended
his patrons to seek higher game in Newland; hence he may be
called the father of the English whale-fisheries at Spitzbergen.

Next year Hudson was again sent by the Muscovy Company
to open a passage to China, this time by the north-east route
between Spitzbergen and Novaya Zemlya, which had been
attempted by his predecessors and especially by the Dutch
navigator William Barents. This voyage lasted from the 22nd
of April to the 26th of August 1608. He raked the Barents Sea
in vain between 75° 30&prime; N.W. and 71° 15&prime; S.E. for an opening
through the ice, and on the 6th of July, &ldquo;voide of hope of a
north-east passage (except by the Waygats, for which I was not
fitted to trie or prove),&rdquo; he resolved to sail to the north-west, and
if time and means permitted to run a hundred leagues up
Lumley&rsquo;s Inlet (Frobisher Strait) or Davis&rsquo;s &ldquo;overfall&rdquo; (Hudson
Strait). But his voyage being delayed by contrary winds he was
finally compelled to return without accomplishing his wish. The
failure of this second attempt satisfied the Muscovy Company,
which thenceforward directed all its energies to the profitable
Spitzbergen trade.

Towards the end of 1608 Hudson &ldquo;had a call&rdquo; to Amsterdam,
850
where he saw the celebrated cosmographer the Rev. Peter
Plancius and the cartographer Hondius, and after some delay,
due to the rivalry which was exhibited in the attempt to secure
his services, he undertook for the Dutch East India Company
his important third voyage to find a passage to China either by the
north-east or north-west route. With a mixed crew of eighteen
or twenty men he left the Texel in the &ldquo;Half-Moon&rdquo; on the 6th
of April, and by the 5th of May was in the Barents Sea, and soon
afterwards among the ice near Novaya Zemlya, where he had
been the year before. Some of his men becoming disheartened
and mutinous (it is now supposed that he had arrived two or
three months too early), he lost hope of effecting anything by
that route, and submitted to his men, as alternative proposals,
either to go to Lumley&rsquo;s Inlet and follow up Waymouth&rsquo;s light, or
to make for North Virginia and seek the passage in about 40° lat.,
according to the letter and map sent him by his friend Captain
John Smith. The latter plan was adopted, and on the 14th of
May Hudson set his face towards the Chesapeake and China.
He touched at Stromo in the Faroe Islands for water, and on
the 15th of June off Newfoundland the &ldquo;Half-Moon&rdquo; &ldquo;spent
overboard her foremast.&rdquo; This accident compelled him to put
into the Kennebec river, where a mast was procured, and
some communication and an unnecessary encounter with the
Indians took place. Sailing again on the 26th of July, he began
on the 28th of August the survey where Smith left off, at 37° 36&prime;
according to his map, and coasted northwards. On the 3rd of
September, in 40° 30&prime;, he entered the fine bay of New York, and
after having gone 150 m. up the river which now bears his name
to near the position of the present Albany, treating with the
Indians, surveying the country, and trying the stream above
tide-water, he became satisfied that this course did not lead to
the South Sea or China, a conclusion in harmony with that of
Champlain, who the same summer had been making his way
south through Lake Champlain and Lake St Sacrement (now
Lake George). The two explorers by opposite routes approached
within 20 leagues of each other. On the 4th of October the
&ldquo;Half-Moon&rdquo; weighed for the Texel, and on the 7th of November
arrived at Dartmouth, where she was seized and detained by the
English government, Hudson and the other Englishmen of the
ship being commanded not to leave England, but rather to serve
their own country. The voyage had fallen short of Hudson&rsquo;s
expectations, but it served many purposes perhaps as important
to the world. Among other results it exploded Hakluyt&rsquo;s myth,
which from the publication of Lok&rsquo;s map in 1582 to the 2nd
charter of Virginia in May 1609 he had lost no opportunity of
promulgating, that near 40° lat. there was a narrow isthmus,
formed by the sea of Verrazano, like that of Tehuantepec or
Panama.

Hudson&rsquo;s confidence in the existence of a North-West Passage
had not been diminished by his three failures, and a new company
was formed to support him in a fourth attempt, the principal
promoters being Sir Thomas Smith (or Smythe), Sir Dudley
Digges and John (afterwards Sir John) Wolstenholme. He
determined this time to carry out his old plan of searching for a
passage up Davis&rsquo;s &ldquo;overfall&rdquo;&mdash;so-called in allusion to the overfall
of the tide which Davis had observed rushing through the
strait. Hudson sailed from London in the little ship &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo;
of 55 tons, on the 17th of April 1610, and entered the strait
which now bears his name about the middle of June. Sailing
steadily westward he entered Hudson Bay on the 3rd of August,
and passing southward spent the next three months examining
the eastern shore of the bay. On the 1st of November
the &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; went into winter quarters in the S.W. corner
of James Bay, being frozen in a few days later, and during the
long winter months which were passed there only a scanty
supply of game was secured to eke out the ship&rsquo;s provisions.
Discontent became rife, and on the ship breaking out of the ice
in the spring Hudson had a violent quarrel with a dissolute
young fellow named Henry Greene, whom he had befriended by
taking him on board, and who now retaliated by inciting the
discontented part of the crew to put Hudson and eight others
(including the sick men) out of the ship. This happened on the
22nd of June 1611. Robert Bylot was elected master and
brought the ship back to England. During the voyage home
Greene and several others were killed in a fight with the Eskimo,
while others again died of starvation, and the feeble remnant
which reached England in September were thrown into prison.
No more tidings were ever received of the deserted men.

Although it is certain that the four great geographical landmarks
which to-day serve to keep Hudson&rsquo;s memory alive,
namely the Hudson Bay, Strait, Territory and River, had
repeatedly been visited and even drawn on maps and charts before
he set out on his voyages, yet he deserves to take a very high rank
among northern navigators for the mere extent of his discoveries
and the success with which he pushed them beyond the limits
of his predecessors. The rich fisheries of Spitzbergen and the
fur industry of the Hudson Bay Territory were the immediate
fruit of his labours.


See Henry Hudson, the Navigator (Hakluyt Society, 1860); and
T. A. Janvier, Henry Hudson (1909). In 1909 a great celebration of
the tercentenary was held in the United States.




HUDSON, JOHN (1662-1719), English classical scholar, was
born at Wythop in Cumberland. He was educated at Oxford,
where the remainder of his life was spent. In 1701 he was
appointed Bodley&rsquo;s librarian, and in 1711 principal of St Mary&rsquo;s
Hall. His political views stood in the way of his preferment in
the church and university. He died on the 26th of November
1719. As an editor and commentator he enjoyed a high reputation
both at home and abroad. His works, chiefly editions of
classical authors, include the following: Velleius Paterculus
(1693); Thucydides (1696); Geographiae Veteris Scriptores
Graeci minores (1698-1712) containing the works and fragments
of 21 authors and the learned, though diffuse, dissertations of
H. Dodwell&mdash;a rare and valuable work, which in spite of its
faulty text was not superseded until the appearance of C. W.
Müller&rsquo;s edition in the Didot series: the editio princeps of
Moeris, De Vocibus Atticis et Hellenicis (1712); Josephus (1720,
published posthumously by his friend Anthony Hall, the antiquary),
a correct and beautifully printed edition, with variorum
notes and translation.

Josephus; W. Hutchinson, History of Cumberland (1794).




HUDSON, a city and the county-seat of Columbia county,
New York, U.S.A., on the E. side of the Hudson river, about
114 m. N. of New York City and about 28 m. S. of Albany.
Pop. (1890) 9970; (1900) 9528, of whom 1155 were foreign-born;
(1910 census) 11,417. It is served by the Boston &amp; Albany,
the New York Central &amp; Hudson River and the (electric)
Albany &amp; Hudson railways, by river steamboats, and by a steam
ferry to Athens and Catskill across the river. The city is picturesquely
situated on the slope of Prospect Hill; and Promenade
Park, on a bluff above the steamboat landing, commands a
fine view of the river and of the Catskill Mountains. Among
the public buildings and institutions are a fine city hall, the
Columbia County Court House, a public library, a Federal
building, a State Training School for Girls, a State Firemen&rsquo;s
Home, an Orphan Asylum, a Home for the Aged and a hospital.
The city&rsquo;s manufactures include hosiery and knit goods, Portland
cement (one of the largest manufactories of that product in the
United States being here), foundry and machine shop products,
car wheels, ice tools and machinery, ale, beer, bricks and tiles
and furniture. The value of the factory products in 1905 was
$4,115,525, an increase of 58.1% over that in 1900. The
municipality owns and operates the water-works. Hudson,
which was originally known as Claverack Landing, was for many
years merely a landing with two rude wharfs and two small
storehouses, to which farmers in the neighbourhood brought
their produce for shipment on the river. Late in 1783 the place
was settled by an association of merchants and fishermen from
Rhode Island, Nantucket and Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard. The present
name was adopted in 1784, and the city was chartered in 1785.
For many years Hudson had a considerable foreign commerce
and whaling interests, but these were practically destroyed
by the war of 1812.

HUDSON BAY (less often, but more correctly, Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay), an inland sea in the N.E. of Canada, extending from
78° to 95° W. and from 51° to 70° N. On the east it is connected
with the Atlantic Ocean by Hudson Strait, and on the north with
the Arctic Ocean by Fox Channel and Fury and Hecla Strait.
Its southern extremity between 55° and 51° N. is known as James
Bay. It is 590 m. in width, and 1300 from S. to N., including
James Bay (350 m.) and Fox Channel (350 m.). The customary
use of the term includes James Bay, but not Fox Channel. The
average depth of water is about 70 fathoms, deepening at the
entrance of Hudson Strait to 100 fathoms. James Bay is
much shallower, and unfit for shipping save for a central channel
leading to the mouth of the Moose river. The centre and west
of the main bay are absolutely free from shoals, rocks or islands,
but down its east coast extend two lines of small islands, one
close to shore, the other at 70 to 100 m. distance, and comprising
a number of scattered groups (the Ottawa Islands, the Sleepers,
the Belchers, &amp;c.).

Into Hudson and James Bays flow numerous important rivers,
so much so that the water of the latter is rather brackish than
salt. Beginning at the north-west, the chief of these are Churchill,
Nelson (draining Lake Winnipeg, and the numerous inland
rivers of which it is the basin), Hayes (the old boat route of the
voyageurs to Winnipeg), Severn, Albany, Moose, Rupert river
(draining Lake Mistassini), Nottaway, East Main, Great Whale
and Little Whale.

Save for some high bluffs on the east and north-east, the shores
of the bay are low. Around much of James Bay extend marshes
and swampy ground. Geologically the greater part of the
Hudson Bay district belongs to the Laurentian system, though
there are numerous outcrops of later formation; Cambro-Silurian
on the south and west, and to the north of Cape Jones
(the north-eastern extremity of James Bay) a narrow belt of
Cambrian rocks, of which the islands are composed. Coal,
plumbago, iron and other minerals have been found in various
districts near the coast. The climate is harsh, though vegetables
and certain root crops ripen in the open air as far north as Fort
Churchill; cattle flourish, and are fed chiefly on the native
grasses; spruce, balsam and poplar grow to a fair size as far
as the northern limit of James Bay. Caribou, musk ox and other
animals are still found in large numbers, and there is an abundance
of feathered game&mdash;ducks, geese, loons and ptarmigan;
hunting and fishing form the chief occupations of the Indians
and Eskimo who live in scattered bands near the shore. The
bay abounds with fish, of which the chief are cod, salmon,
porpoise and whales. The last have long been pursued by
American whalers, whose destructive methods have so greatly
depleted the supply that the government of Canada is anxious
to declare the bay a mare clausum.

Hudson Strait is about 450 m. long with an average breadth
of 100 m., narrowing at one point to 45. Its shores are high
and bold, rarely less in height than 1000 ft., save on the coast
of Ungava Bay, a deep indentation on the south-east. No
islands or rocks impede navigation. Its depth is from 100 to
200 fathoms. Owing to the violence of the tides, which rise to
a height of 35 ft., it never absolutely freezes over.


After three centuries of exploration, the navigability of Hudson
Bay and Strait remains a vexed question. To Canada it is one of
great commercial interest, and numerous expeditions have been
made and reports issued by the Geological Survey. From Winnipeg
to Liverpool via Churchill is over 500 m. less than via Montreal, and
from Edmonton to Liverpool almost 1000 m. less. Were navigation
open for a sufficient time, such a route for the grain of the Canadian
and American west would be of enormous advantage. But the inlet
from the Arctic sends down masses of heavy ice, which drift about
in the bay and the strait. Past the mouth of the strait flows a
stream often over 100 m. wide, of berg and floe ice, carried by the
Arctic current. Owing to the proximity of the Magnetic Pole (in
Boothia) the compass often refuses to work. For sailing ships, such
as the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company has long employed, the season for
safe navigation is from the 15th of July to the 1st of October. In
over 200 years very few serious accidents have occurred to the
company&rsquo;s ships within these limits. It is claimed that specially
built and protected steamers would be safe from the 15th of June
till the 1st of November, and the problem may be solved by ice-breaking
vessels of great power. The only good harbour available
is Fort Churchill, at the mouth of the Churchill river, which is large
and easy of access. Moose Factory (at the foot of James Bay) and
York Factory (at the mouth of the Nelson) are mere roadsteads.
Marble Island, south of Chesterfield Inlet, where the whalers winter,
is too far north for regular shipping.

The Cabots entered the strait in 1498, and during the next century
a series of Elizabethan mariners; but the bay was not explored
until 1610, when Henry Hudson pushed through the ice and
explored to the southern limit of James Bay.

Expeditions (1884, 5, 6); William Ogilvie, Exploratory Survey to
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay in 1890 (Ottawa, 1891); R. F. Stupart, The Navigation
of Hudson&rsquo;s Bay and Straits (Toronto, 1904).

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
