vPREFACE
Opinions have ever been
divided on the question of the morality, or the
immorality, of smuggling.&nbsp; This is not,
in itself, remarkable, since that subject on
which all men think alike has not yet been discovered; but
whatever the views held upon the question of the rights and
wrongs of the &ldquo;free-traders&rsquo;&rdquo;
craft, they have long since died down into abstract
academic discussion.&nbsp; Smuggling is,
indeed, not dead, but it is not the potent
factor it once was, and to what extent Governments are
justified in taxing or restricting in any way the export or the
import of goods will not again become a living question in this
country until the impending Tariff Reform becomes law.&nbsp;
There have been those who, reading the proofs of this
book, have variously found in it arguments for, and
others arguments against, Protection; but,
as a sheer matter of fact, there are in these pages no
studied arguments either way, and facts are here presented
just as they are retrieved from half-forgotten records,
with no other ulterior object than that of
entertainment.&nbsp; But if these pages also serve to show
with what little wisdom <span
class="pagenum">p. viwe are, and generally have
been, governed, they may not be without their
uses.&nbsp; England, it may surely be gathered,
here and elsewhere, is what she is by sheer force of
dogged middle-class character, and in spite of her
statesmen and lawgivers.

1INTRODUCTORY
Customs dues and embargoes on imports and exports are things
of immemorial antiquity, the inevitable accompaniments of
civilisation and luxury; and the smugglers, who paid no dues and
disregarded all prohibitions, are therefore of necessity equally
ancient.&nbsp; Carthage, the chief commercial community of the
ancient world, was probably as greatly troubled by the questions
of customs tariffs and smuggling as was the England of George the
Third.&nbsp; Without civilisation, and the consequent demand for
the products of other lands, the smuggler&rsquo;s trade cannot
exist.&nbsp; In that highly organised condition of so-styled
civilisation which produces wars and race-hatreds and hostile
tariffs and swollen taxation, the smuggler becomes an important
person, a hateful figure to governments, but not infrequently a
beneficent being to the ill-provided&mdash;in all nations the
most numerous class&mdash;to whom he brought, at a reasonable
price, and with much daring and personal risk, those comforts
which, when they had paid <span
class="pagenum">p. 2toll to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, were all but unattainable.
The chief defence, on the score of morals, set up by those few
smugglers who ever were at pains to prove that smuggling could be
no crime, was that customs duties were originally imposed in the
time of Charles the Second to provide funds for the protection of
our coasts from the Algerine and Barbary pirates who then
occasionally adventured thus far from their piratical lurks in
the Mediterranean and ravaged the more remote villages of our
seaboard.&nbsp; When these dangers ceased, contended these
smugglers on their defence, the customs dues should automatically
have been taken off; but they were, on the contrary, greatly
increased.
This view, or excuse, or defence&mdash;call it how we
will&mdash;was, however, entirely without historical
foundation.&nbsp; It is true, indeed, that some ports had been
taxed, and that customs dues had been imposed for this purpose,
but customs charges were immemorially older than the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; There were probably such imposts in that lengthy
era when Britain was a Roman colony, and we certainly hear of
customs charges being levied in the reign of Ethelred, when a
toll of one halfpenny was charged upon every small boat arriving
at Billingsgate, and one penny upon larger boats, with sails.
These pages will show that not only import, but also export
smuggling was long continued in England, and not only so, but
that the export p.
3smuggling, notably that of wool, was for centuries the
most important, if not the only, kind.&nbsp; The prohibition of
sending wool out of the kingdom was, of course, introduced with
the object of fostering the cloth manufacture; but there are
always two sides to any question, and in this case the embargo
upon wool soon taught the cloth-workers that, in the matter of
prices, they had the wool-growers at their mercy.&nbsp; By law
they could not sell to foreign customers, or (later) only upon
paying heavy dues; and the cloth-workers could therefore
practically dictate their own terms.&nbsp; In this pitiful
resort&mdash;an example of the disastrous effect of government
interference with trade&mdash;there was nothing left but to set
the law at defiance, which the wool-growers and their allies, the
&ldquo;owlers,&rdquo; accordingly did, risking life and limb in
the wholesale exportation of wool.&nbsp; It is the duty of every
citizen to oppose bad laws, but this opposition to ill-conceived
enactments creates a furtive class of men, very Ishmaelites, who,
with their liberty, and even their lives, forfeit, are rendered
capable, in extremity, of any and every enormity.&nbsp; Hence
arose those reckless bands of smugglers who in the middle of the
eighteenth century became highly organised and all-powerful in
Kent, Sussex, and Hampshire, and, realising their power,
developed into criminals of the most ferocious type.&nbsp; They
were, properly regarded, the products of bad government, the
creatures brought into existence by a vicious system that took
its origin in the coming of William the Third, <a
name="page4">p. 4the
&ldquo;Deliverer,&rdquo; as history, tongue in cheek, styles
him.
The growth of customs dues in the last years of the
seventeenth century, and so onward, in a vicious progression
until the opening years of the nineteenth, was not in any way
owing to consideration for home traders, or to a desire for the
protection of British industries.&nbsp; They grew exactly in
proportion as the needs of the Government for revenue increased;
and were the direct results of that long-continued policy of
foreign alliances and aggressive interference in continental
politics&mdash;that &ldquo;spirited foreign policy&rdquo;
advocated even in our own times&mdash;which was introduced with
the coming of William the Third.&nbsp; We did well to depose
James the Second, but we might have done better than bring over
his son-in-law and make him king; and we might, still more, have
done better than raise the Elector of Hanover to the status of
British sovereign, as George the First.&nbsp; Then we should
probably have avoided foreign entanglements, at any rate, until
that later era when increased intercourse between the nations
rendered international politics inevitable.
Foreign wars, and the heavy duties levied to pay for them,
brought about the enormous growth of smuggling, and directly
caused all the miseries and the blood-stained incidents that make
the story of the smugglers so &ldquo;romantic.&rdquo;&nbsp; Glory
is very fine, and stirs the pulses in reading the pages of
history, but it is a commodity for which victorious nations, no
less than the p.
5defeated, are called upon to pay in blood, tears, and
privation.
With the great peace that, in 1815, succeeded the long and
harassing period of continual war, the people naturally looked
forward towards a time when the excessively heavy duties would be
reduced, and many articles altogether relieved from
taxation.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, some of these duties scarce
paid the cost of their collection, and simply helped to keep in
office a large and increasing horde of officials.&nbsp; But the
price of glory continues to be paid, long after the laurels have
faded; and not for many years to come were those imposts
reduced.
Sydney Smith, writing in 1820 on the subject of American
desire for a large navy, even then very manifest, warned the
people of the United States of the nemesis awaiting such
indulgence.&nbsp; &ldquo;We can inform Jonathan,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;what are the inevitable consequences of being too fond of
glory: Taxes upon every article which enters into the mouth, or
covers the back, or is placed under the foot; taxes upon
everything which it is pleasant to see, hear, feel, smell, or
taste; taxes upon warmth, light, and locomotion; taxes on
everything on earth, and the waters under the earth; on
everything that comes from abroad, or is grown at home; taxes on
the raw material, taxes on every fresh value that is added to it
by the industry of man; taxes on the sauce which pampers
man&rsquo;s appetite and the drug that restores him to health; on
the ermine which decorates the <span
class="pagenum">p. 6judge and the rope which hangs the
criminal; on the poor man&rsquo;s salt and the rich man&rsquo;s
spice; on the brass nails of the coffin and the ribands of the
bride; at bed or board, couchant or levant, we must pay.&nbsp;
The schoolboy whips his taxed top; the beardless youth manages
his taxed horse with a taxed bridle on a taxed road; and the
dying Englishman, pouring his medicine, which has paid seven per
cent., into a spoon that has paid fifteen per cent., flings
himself back upon his chintz bed which has paid twenty-two per
cent., makes his will on an eight-pound stamp, and expires in the
arms of an apothecary who has paid a licence of a hundred pounds
for the privilege of putting him to death.&nbsp; His whole
property is then immediately taxed from two to ten per
cent.&nbsp; Besides the probate, large fees are demanded for
burying him in the chancel; his virtues are handed down to
posterity on taxed marble; and he is then gathered to his
fathers&mdash;to be taxed no more.&rdquo;
The real cost of military glory was aptly shown by a
caricaturist of this period, who illustrated the general rise of
prices consequent upon war in the following incident of an old
country-woman buying a halfpenny candle at a chandler&rsquo;s
shop:
&ldquo;Price has gone up,&rdquo; said the shopkeeper curtly,
when she tendered the money.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for, then?&rdquo; asked the old
woman.
&ldquo;On account of the war, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Od rot &rsquo;em! do they fight by candlelight?&rdquo;
she not unnaturally asked.
p.
7Housekeepers of the present day may well
enter&mdash;although somewhat ruefully&mdash;into the humour of
this simple story, for in the great and continued rise of every
commodity since the great Boer War, it is most poignantly
illustrated for us.&nbsp; In short, the people who pay for the
glory see nothing of it, and derive nothing from it.
How entirely true were those witty phrases of Sydney Smith we
may easily guess from the mere rough statement that there were,
in 1787, no fewer than 1,425 articles liable to duty (very many
of them taxed at several times their market value), bringing in
&pound;6,000,000 a year.
In 1797 the customs laws filled six large folio volumes.&nbsp;
The total number of Customs Acts prior to the accession of George
the Third was 800, but no fewer than 1,300 were added between the
years 1760 and 1813, and newer Acts, partly repealing and partly
adding to older enactments, were continually being added to this
vast mass of chaotic legislation down to the middle of the
Victorian era, until even experts were frequently baffled as to
the definite legal position of many given articles.&nbsp;
Finally&mdash;it is typical of our English amateur way of doing
things&mdash;in 1876, when so-called &ldquo;Free Trade&rdquo; had
come in, and few articles remained customable, the customs laws
were consolidated.
Many years before, at one swoop, Sir Robert Peel had removed
the duties from four hundred different dutiable articles,
leaving, however, many hundreds of others more or less heavily
assessed.
p. 8In
consequence of this relief from taxation, smuggling rapidly
decreased, and the Commissioners of Customs were enabled to
report: &ldquo;With the reduction of duties, and the removal of
all needless and vexatious restrictions, smuggling has greatly
diminished, and the public sentiment with regard to it has
undergone a very considerable change.&nbsp; The smuggler is no
longer an object of general sympathy, as a hero of romance; and
people are beginning to awaken to a perception of the fact that
his offence is not only a fraud on the revenue, but a robbery of
the fair trader.&nbsp; Smuggling is now almost entirely confined
to tobacco, spirits, and watches.&rdquo;
No fewer than four hundred and fifty other dutiable articles
were struck off the list in 1845, and the Cobdenite era of Free
Trade, to which, it was expected, all other nations would
speedily be converted, had opened.
&ldquo;Free Trade,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;killed
smuggling.&rdquo;&nbsp; It naturally killed smuggling so far as
duty-free articles were concerned; but this all-embracing term of
&ldquo;Free Trade&rdquo; is altogether a mockery and a
delusion.&nbsp; There has never been&mdash;there is not
now&mdash;complete Free Trade in this so-called free-trade
country.&nbsp; Wines and spirits, tobacco, tea and coffee, cocoa
and sugar, are not they in the forefront of the articles that
render regularly to the Chancellor of the Exchequer?&nbsp; There
have been, indeed, throughout all the years of the Free Trade
era, some forty articles scheduled for paying customs duty on
import into the United Kingdom.&nbsp; <span
class="pagenum">p. 9They help the revenue to the extent of
about &pound;27,000,000 per annum.
The romance of smuggling has very largely engaged the
attention of every description of writers, but we do not hear so
much of its commercial aspects, although it must be evident that
for men to dare so greatly as the smugglers did with winds and
waves and with the customs&rsquo; forces, the possible gains must
have been great.&nbsp; Time and again a cargo of tea or of
spirits would be seized, and yet the smugglers be prepared with
other ventures, knowing, as they did, that one entirely
successful run would pay for perhaps two failures.&nbsp; When tea
could be purchased in Holland at sevenpence a pound, and sold in
England at prices ranging from 3s. 6d. to
5s., and when tobacco, purchased at the same price, sold
at 2s. 6d., it is evident that great possibilities
existed for the enterprising free-trader.
As regards spirits, if we take brandy as an example, we find
almost equal profits; for excellent cognac was shipped from
Roscoff, in Brittany, from Cherbourg, Dieppe, and other French
ports in tubs of four gallons each, which cost in France &pound;1
a tub, and sold in England at &pound;4.&nbsp; One of the ordinary
smuggling luggers, generally built especially for this traffic,
on racing lines, would hold eighty tubs.
On such a cargo being brought, according to preconcerted plan,
within easy distance off-shore, generally at night, a lantern or
other signal shown from cliff or beach by confederates on land
would p.
10indicate the precise spot where the goods were most
safely to be beached; and there would be assembled a sufficient
company of labourers engaged for the job.&nbsp; A cargo of eighty
tubs required forty men, who carried two each, slung by ropes
over chest and back.&nbsp; According to circumstances, they
marched in company on foot, inland; or, if the distance were
great, they went on horseback, each man with a led horse,
carrying three or four tubs in addition.&nbsp; These labourers,
although not finally interested in the safe running of the goods,
and not paid on any other basis than being hired for the heavy
job of carrying considerable weights throughout the night, were
quite ready and willing to fight any opponents that might be met,
as innumerable accounts of savage encounters tell us.&nbsp;
Besides these carriers, there were often, in case of opposition
to the landing being anticipated, numerous &ldquo;batsmen,&rdquo;
armed with heavy clubs, to protect the goods.
The pay of a labourer or carrier varied widely, of course, in
different places, at different times, and according to
circumstances.&nbsp; It ranged from five shillings to half a
sovereign a night, and generally included also a present of a
package of tea or a tub of brandy for so many successful
runs.&nbsp; It is recorded that the labourers engaged for riding
horseback, each with a led horse, from Sandwich, Deal, Dover,
Folkestone, or Romney, to Canterbury, a distance of some fifteen
miles, were paid seven shillings a night.&nbsp; The horses cost
the smugglers nothing, for they were commandeered, <a
name="page11">p. 11as a general
rule, from the neighbouring farmers, who did not usually offer
any objection, for it was not often that the gangs forgot to
leave a tub in payment.&nbsp; The method employed in thus
requisitioning horses was quite simple.&nbsp; An unsigned note
would be handed to a farmer stating that his horses were wanted,
for some purpose unnamed, on a certain night; and that he was
desired to leave his stables unlocked for those who would come
and fetch them.&nbsp; If he did not comply with this demand he
very soon had cause to regret it in the mysterious disasters that
would shortly afterwards overtake him: his outbuildings being
destroyed by fire, his farming implements smashed, or his cattle
mutilated.
The farmers, indeed, were somewhat seriously embarrassed by
the prevalence of smuggling.&nbsp; On the one hand, they had to
lend their horses for the smugglers&rsquo; purposes, and on the
other they discovered that the demand for carriers of tubs and
other goods shortened the supply of labour available for
agricultural purposes, and sent up the rate of wages.&nbsp; A
labourer in the pay of smugglers would often be out three nights
in the week, and, with the money he received and with additional
payment in kind, was in a very comfortable position.

12CHAPTER I
<span
class="smcap">The &ldquo;Owlers&rdquo; of Romney Marsh,
and the Ancient Export Smuggling of
Wool
The earliest conflicts of interests
between smugglers and the Government were concerned with the
export of goods, and not with imports.&nbsp; We are accustomed to
think only of the import smuggler, who brought from across
Channel, or from more distant shores, the spirits, wines, tea,
coffee, silks, laces, and tobacco that had never yielded to the
revenue of the country; but before him in point of time, if not
also in importance, was the &ldquo;owler&rdquo; who, defying all
prohibitions and penalties, even to those of bodily mutilation
and death, sold wool out of England and secretly shipped it at
night from the shores of Kent and Sussex.
English wool had from a very early date been greatly in demand
on the Continent.&nbsp; The England of those distant times was a
purely agricultural country, innocent of arts, industries, and
manufactures, except of the most primitive description.&nbsp; The
manufacturers then exercised their skilled trades largely in
France and the Low Countries; and, in especial, the cloth-weaving
industries were practised in Flanders.




p. 13So
early as the reign of Edward the First the illegal exportation of
wool engaged the attention of the authorities, and an export duty
of &pound;3 a bag (in modern money) was imposed, soon after
1276.&nbsp; This was in 1298 increased to &pound;6 a bag, then
lowered, and then again raised.&nbsp; English wool was then worth
1s. 6d. a pound.
In the reign of Edward the Third a strenuous attempt was made
to introduce the weaving industries into England, and every
inducement was offered the Flemish weavers to settle here and to
bring their art with them.&nbsp; In support of this policy, the
export of wool was, in various years, subjected to further
restrictions, and at one time entirely forbidden.&nbsp; The royal
solicitude for the newly cradled English weaving industries also
in 1337 forbade the wearing of clothing made with cloth woven out
of the country; but it is hardly necessary to add that edicts of
this stringency were constantly broken; and in 1341 Winchelsea,
Chichester, and thirteen other ports were named, whence wool
might be exported, on payment of a duty of 50s. a sack of
twenty-six stone&mdash;i.e. 364 lb.
The interferences with the sale and export of wool continued,
and the duty was constantly being raised or lowered, according to
the supposed needs of the time; but nearly always with unforeseen
and disastrous effects.&nbsp; The wool staple was removed to the
then English possession of Calais in 1363, and the export of it
absolutely forbidden elsewhere.&nbsp; The natural result, in
spite p. 14of
the great amount of smuggling carried on, was that in a long
series of years the value of wool steadily fell; the cloth-makers
taking advantage of the accumulation of stocks on the
growers&rsquo; hands to depress the price.&nbsp; In 1390 the
growers had from three to five seasons&rsquo; crops on hand, and
the state of the industry had become such that in the following
year permission to export generally, on payment of duty, was
conceded.&nbsp; This duty tended to become gradually heavier,
and, as it increased, so proportionably did the
&ldquo;owling&rdquo; trade.
The price of wool therefore declined again, and in 1454 it was
recorded as being not more than two-thirds of what it had been a
hundred and ten years earlier.&nbsp; The wool-growers, on the
brink of ruin, petitioned that wool, according to its various
grades, might not be sold under certain fixed prices; which were
accordingly fixed.
But to follow, seriatim, the movements in prices and
the complete reversals of Government policy regarding the export,
would be wearisome.&nbsp; We will, therefore, pass on to the
Restoration of the monarchy, in 1660, when the export of wool was
again entirely forbidden.&nbsp; Smuggling of it was in 1662
again, by the reactionary laws of the period, made a felony,
punishable with death; yet the active smugglers, the rank and
file of the owling trade, who performed the hard manual labour
for wages, at the instigation of those financially interested,
continued to risk their necks for twelvepence a day.&nbsp; The
low price their p.
15services commanded is alone sufficient to show us that
labour, in spite of the risks, was plentiful.&nbsp; Not only Kent
and Sussex, but Essex, and Ireland as well, largely entered into
this secret &ldquo;stealing of wool out of the country,&rdquo; as
the phrase ran; and &ldquo;these caterpillars&rdquo; had so many
evasions, and commanded so many combinations and interests among
those officials whose business it was to detect and punish, that
few dared interfere: hence the readiness of the labourers to
&ldquo;risk their necks,&rdquo; the risk being, under the
circumstances, small.
Indeed, readers of the adventures of these owling desperadoes
and of the customs officers who hunted them will, perhaps, come
to the conclusion that the risks on either side were pretty
evenly apportioned, and they will see that the hunters not seldom
became the hunted.
The experiences of one W. Carter, who appears to have been in
authority over the customs staff in the Romney Marsh district,
towards the close of the seventeenth century, were at times
singularly vivid.&nbsp; His particular &ldquo;hour of crowded
life&rdquo; came in 1688, while he was engaged in an attempt to
arrest a body of owlers who were shipping wool into some French
shallops between Folkestone and New Romney.
Having procured the necessary warrants, he repaired to Romney,
where he seized eight or ten men who were carrying the wool on
their horses&rsquo; backs to be shipped, and desired the Mayor of
Romney to commit them, but, greatly to the <a
name="page16">p. 16surprise of
this zealous officer, who doubtless imagined he had at last laid
some of these desperate fellows securely by the heels, the Mayor
of Romney consented to the prisoners being admitted to
bail.&nbsp; Mr. Carter, to have been so ingenuously surprised,
must have been a singularly simple official, or quite new to the
business; for what Mayor of Romney in those days, when every one
on the Marsh smuggled, or was interested financially in the
success of smuggling, would dare not deal leniently with these
fellows!&nbsp; Nay, it was even abundantly probable that the
Mayor himself was financially committed in these ventures, and
perhaps even among the employers of Mr. Carter&rsquo;s
captives.
Romney was no safe abiding-place for Carter and his underlings
when these men were enlarged; and they accordingly retired upon
Lydd.&nbsp; But if they had fondly expected peace and shelter
there they were woefully mistaken, for a Marshland cry of
vengeance was raised, and a howling mob of owlers, ululating more
savagely than those melancholy birds from whom they took their
name, violently attacked them in that little town, under cover of
night.&nbsp; The son of the Mayor of Lydd, well disposed to these
sadly persecuted revenue men, advised them to further retire upon
Rye, which they did the next morning, December 13th, pursued
hotly across the dyke-intersected marshes, as far as Camber
Point, by fifty furious men.




At Guilford Ferry the pursuers were so close upon their heels
that they had to hurriedly dismount <span
class="pagenum">p. 17and tumble into some boats belonging
to ships lying near, leaving their horses behind; and so they
came safe, but breathless, into Rye town.
At this period Calais&mdash;then lost to England&mdash;alone
imported within two years 40,000 packs of wool from Kent and
Sussex; and the Romney Marsh men not only sold their own wool in
their illicit manner, but bought other from up-country, ten or
twenty miles inland, and impudently shipped it off.
In 1698, the severe laws of some thirty years earlier having
been thus brought into contempt, milder penal enactments were
introduced, but more stringent conditions than ever were imposed
upon the collection and export of this greatly vexed commodity,
and the civil deterrents of process and fine, aimed at the big
men in the trade, were strengthened.&nbsp; A law was enacted (9
&amp; 10 William the Third, c. 40, ss. 2 and 3) by which no
person living within fifteen miles of the sea in the counties of
Kent and Sussex should buy any wool before he became responsible
in a legal bond, with sureties, that none of the wool he should
buy should be sold by him to any persons within fifteen miles of
the sea; and growers of wool in those counties, within ten miles
of the coast, were obliged, within three days of shearing, to
account for the number of fleeces shorn, and to state where they
were stored.
The success of this new law was not at first very marked, for
the means of enforcing it had not been provided.&nbsp; To enact
repressive edicts, p.
18and not to provide the means of their being respected,
was as unsatisfactory as fighting the wind.&nbsp; The Government,
viewing England as a whole, appointed under the new Act seventeen
surveyors for nineteen counties, with 299 riding-officers: a
force barely sufficient for Kent and Sussex alone.&nbsp; It cost
&pound;20,000 a year, and never earned its keep.
Henry Baker, supervisor for Kent and Sussex, writing on April
25th, 1699, to his official chiefs, stated that there would be
shorn in Romney Marsh, quite apart from the adjacent levels of
Pett, Camber, Guilford, and Dunge Marsh, about 160,000 sheep,
whose fleeces would amount to some three thousand packs of wool,
&ldquo;the greatest part whereof will immediately be sent off hot
into France&mdash;it being so designed, preparations in great
measure being already made for that purpose.&rdquo;
In fact, the new law at first did nothing more than to give
the owlers some extra trouble and expense in cartage of their
packs; for, in order to legally evade the extra disabilities it
imposed, it was only necessary to cart them fifteen miles inland
and make fictitious sale and re-sale of them there; thence
shipping them as they pleased.
By this time the exportation of wool had become not only a
kingly concern&mdash;it had aroused the keen interest of the
nation at large, fast becoming an industrial and cloth-weaving
nation.&nbsp; For two centuries and more past the cloth-workers
had been growing numerous, wealthy, and powerful, <a
name="page19">p. 19and they
meant, as far as it was possible for them to do, to starve the
continental looms out of the trade, for sheer lack of
material.&nbsp; No one cared in the least about the actual grower
of the wool, whether he made a loss or a profit on his
business.&nbsp; It is obvious that if export of it could have
been wholly stopped, the cloth-workers, in the forced absence of
foreign buyers, would have held the unfortunate growers in the
hollow of their hands, and would have been able to dictate the
price of wool.
It is the inalienable right of every human being to fight
against unjust laws; only we must be sure they are unjust.&nbsp;
Perhaps the dividing-line, when self-interest is involved, is not
easily to be fixed.&nbsp; But there can be no doubt that the
wool-growers were labouring under injustice, and that they were
entirely justified in setting those laws at naught which menaced
their existence.
However, by December 1703, Mr. Baker was able to give his
superiors a more favourable report.&nbsp; He believed the neck of
the owling trade to have been broken and the spirit of the owlers
themselves to have been crushed, particularly in Romney
Marsh.&nbsp; There were not, at that time, he observed,
&ldquo;many visible signs&rdquo; of any quantities of wool being
exported: which seems to us rather to point to the perfected
organisation of the owling trade than to its being crushed out of
existence.
&ldquo;But for fine goods,&rdquo; continued the supervisor,
&ldquo;as they call them (viz. silks, lace, etc.), I am
well assured that the trade goes on through <a
name="page20">p. 20both
counties, though not in such vast quantities as have been
formerly brought in&mdash;I mean in those days when (as a
gentleman of estate in one of the counties has within this twelve
months told me) he has been att once, besides at other times, at
the loading of a wagon with silks, laces, etc., till six oxen
could hardly move it out of the place.&nbsp; I doe not think that
the trade is now so carried on as &rsquo;twas then.&rdquo;
Things being so promising in the purview of this simple
person, it seemed well to him to suggest to the Commissioners of
the Board of Customs that a reduction of the annual charge of
&pound;4,500 for the preventive service along the coasts of Kent
and Sussex might be effected.&nbsp; At that time there were fifty
preventive officers patrolling over two hundred miles of
seaboard, each in receipt of &pound;60 per annum, and each
provided with a servant and a horse, to help in night duty, at an
estimated annual cost of &pound;30 for each officer.
We may here legitimately pause in surprise at the small pay
for which these men were ready to endure the dangers and
discomforts of such a service; very real perils and most
unmistakable disagreeables, in midst of an almost openly hostile
country-side.
Mr. Baker, sanguine man that he was, proposed to abolish the
annual allowance to each of these hard-worked men for servant and
horse, thus saving &pound;1,500 a year, and to substitute for
them patrols of the Dragoon regiments at that time stationed in
Kent.&nbsp; These regiments had been <span
class="pagenum">p. 21originally placed there in 1698 to
overawe the owlers and other smugglers, the soldiers being paid
twopence extra a day (which certainly did not err upon the side
of extravagance) and the officers in proportion: the annual cost
on that head amounting to &pound;200 per annum.&nbsp; This
military stiffening of the civil force employed to prevent
clandestine export and import appears to have been discontinued
in 1701, after about two years&rsquo; experiment.
These revived patrols, at a cost of &pound;200, the supervisor
calculated, would more efficiently and economically undertake the
work hitherto performed by the preventive officers&rsquo; horses
and men, still leaving a saving of &pound;1,300 a year.&nbsp;
With this force, and a guard of cruisers offshore, he was quite
convinced that the smuggling of these parts would still be kept
under.
But alas for these calculations!&nbsp; The economy thus
effected on this scheme, approved of and put into being, was
altogether illusory.&nbsp; The owling trade, of which the
supervisor had supposed the neck to be broken, flourished more
impudently than before.&nbsp; The Dragoons formed a most
inefficient patrol, and worked ill with the revenue officers,
and, in short, the Revenue lost annually many more thousands of
pounds sterling than it saved hundreds.&nbsp; When sheriffs and
under-sheriffs could be, and were, continually bribed, it is not
to be supposed that Dragoons, thoroughly disliking such an
inglorious service as that of chasing smugglers along muddy lanes
and across country p.
22intricately criss-crossed with broad dykes rarely to be
jumped, would be superior to secret advances that gave them much
more than their miserable twopence a day.
Transportation for wool-smugglers who did not pay the fines
awarded against them was enacted in 1717; ineffectually, for in
1720 it was found necessary to issue a proclamation, enforcing
the law; and in five successive years from 1731 the cloth-workers
are found petitioning for greater vigilance against the continued
clandestine exportation, alleging a great decay in the woollen
manufactures owing to this illegal export; 150,000 packs being
shipped yearly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is feared,&rdquo; said these
petitioners, fighting for their own hand, regardless, of course,
of other interests, &ldquo;that some gentlemen of no mean rank,
whose estates border on the sea-coast, are too much influenced by
a near, but false, prospect of gain&rdquo;: to which the
gentlemen in question, being generally brought up on the dead
classic languages, might most fairly have replied, had they cared
to do so, with the easy Latinity of Tu quoque!
This renewed daring and enterprise of the Sussex smugglers led
to many encounters with the customs officers.&nbsp; Among these
was the desperate engagement between sixty armed smugglers and
customs men at Ferring, on June 21st, 1720, when William
Goldsmith, of the Customs, had his horse shot under him.
A humorous touch, so far at least as the modern reader of
these things is concerned, is <span
class="pagenum">p. 23found in the Treasury warrant issued
about this time, for the sum of &pound;200, for supplying a
regiment with new boots and stockings; their usual allowance of
these indispensable articles having been &ldquo;worn out in the
pursuit of smugglers.&rdquo;
In spite of all attempts to suppress these illegal activities,
it had to be acknowledged, in the preamble of an Act passed in
1739, that the export of wool was &ldquo;notoriously
continued.&rdquo;
The old-established owling trade of Romney Marsh at length,
after many centuries, gave place to the clandestine import of
silks, tea, spirits, and tobacco; but it was only by slow and
insensible degrees that the owlers&rsquo; occupation dwindled
away, in the lessening foreign demand for English wool.&nbsp; The
last was not heard of this more than five-centuries-old question
of the export of wool, that had so severely exercised the minds
of some twenty generations, and had baffled the lawgivers in all
that space of time, until the concluding year of the final wars
with France at the beginning of the nineteenth century.
Many other articles were at the same time forbidden to be
exported; among them Fuller&rsquo;s-earth, used in the
manufacture of cloth, and so, of course, subject to the same
interdict as wool.&nbsp; A comparatively late Exchequer trial for
the offence of exporting Fuller&rsquo;s-earth was that of one
Edmund Warren, in 1693.&nbsp; Fortunately for the defendant, he
was able to show that what he had exported was not
Fuller&rsquo;s-earth at all, but potter&rsquo;s clay.

24CHAPTER II
<span
class="smcap">Growth of Tea and Tobacco Smuggling in the
Eighteenth Century&mdash;Repressive
Laws a Failure
Side by side with the export
smuggling of wool, the import smuggling of tobacco and tea grew
and throve amazingly in later ages.&nbsp; Every one, knowingly or
unsuspectingly, smoked tobacco and drank tea that had paid no
duty.
&ldquo;Great Anna&rdquo; herself, who was among the earliest
to yield to the refining influence of tea&mdash;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great
Anna, whom three realms obey,
Doth sometimes counsel take, and sometimes tay&mdash;

in all probability often drank tea which had contributed
nothing to the revenue.&nbsp; Between them tea and tobacco, in
the illegal landing of the goods, found employment for hundreds
of hardy seafaring men and stalwart landsmen, and led to much
violence and bloodshed, beside which the long-drawn annals of the
owlers seem almost barren of incident.
Early in the eighteenth century, when continental wars of vast
magnitude were in progress, the list of dutiable articles began
to grow quickly, p.
25and concurrently with the growth of this list the
already existing tariff was continually increased.&nbsp; The
smugglers&rsquo; trade grew with these growths, and for the first
time became a highly organised and widely distributed trade,
involving every class.&nbsp; The time had come at last when every
necessary of daily use was taxed heavily, often far above its
ordinary trading value; and an absurd, and indeed desperate,
condition of affairs had been reached, in which people of all
ranks were more or less faced with the degrading dilemma of being
unable to afford many articles generally consumed by persons of
their station in life, or of procuring them of the
smugglers&mdash;the &ldquo;free traders,&rdquo; as they rightly
styled themselves&mdash;often at a mere one-third of the cost to
which they would have been put had their illicit purchasers paid
duty.
The Government was, as we now perceive, in the mental
perspective afforded by lapse of time, in the clearly
indefensible position of heavily taxing the needs of the country,
and of making certain practices illegal that tended to supply
those needs at much lower rates than those thus artificially
created, and yet of being unable to provide adequate means by
which these generally detested laws could be enforced.&nbsp; It
was, and is, no defence to hold that the revenues thus hoped for
were a sufficient excuse.&nbsp; To create an artificial restraint
of trade, to elevate trading in spite of restraint into a crime,
and yet not to provide an overmastering force that shall secure
p. 26obedience,
if not in one sense respect, for those unnatural laws, was in
itself a course of action that any impartial historian might well
hold to be in itself criminal; for it led to continual
disturbances throughout the country, with appalling violence, and
great loss of life, in conflict, or in the darker way of secret
murder.
But no historian would, on weighing the evidence available,
feel altogether sure of so sweeping an indictment of the
eighteenth-century governance of England.&nbsp; It was corrupt,
it was self-seeking, it had no breadth of view; but the times
were well calculated to test the most Heaven-sent
statesmanship.&nbsp; The country, as were all other countries,
was governed for the classes; and governed, as one would conduct
a business, for revenue; whether the revenue was to be applied in
conducting foreign wars, or to find its way plentifully into the
pockets of placemen, does not greatly matter.&nbsp; This
misgovernment was a characteristic failing of the age; and it
must, moreover, be recognised that the historian, with his
comprehensive outlook upon the past, spread out, so to speak,
map-like to his gaze, has the advantage of seeing these things as
a whole, and of criticising them as such; while the givers and
administrators of laws were under the obvious disadvantages of
each planning and working for what they considered to be the
needs of their own particular period, with those of the future
unknown, and perhaps uncared for.&nbsp; That there were some few
among those in authority who <span
class="pagenum">p. 27wrought according to their lights,
however feeble might be their illumination, must be conceded even
to that age.
At the opening of this era, when Marlborough&rsquo;s great
victories were yet fresh, and when the cost of them and of other
military glories was wearing the country threadbare, the most
remarkable series of repressive Acts, directed against smuggling,
began.&nbsp; Vessels of very small tonnage and light draught,
being found peculiarly useful to smugglers, the use of such, even
in legalised importing, was strictly forbidden, and no craft of a
lesser burthen than fifteen tons was permitted.&nbsp; This
provision, it was fondly conceived, would strike a blow at
smuggling, by rendering it impossible to slip up narrow and
shallow waterways; but this pious expectation was doomed to
disappointment, and the limit was accordingly raised to thirty
tons; and again, in 1721, to forty tons.&nbsp; At the same time,
the severest restrictions were imposed upon boats, in order to
cope with the ten, or even twelve and fourteen-oared galleys,
rowed by determined &ldquo;free-traders.&rdquo;
To quote the text of one among these drastic ordinances:
&ldquo;Any boat built to row with more than four
oars, found upon land or water within the counties of Middlesex,
Surrey, Kent, or Sussex, or in the river Thames, or within the
limits of the ports of London, Sandwich, or Ipswich, or any boat
rowing with more than six oars found either upon land or water,
in any other port, or within <span
class="pagenum">p. 28two leagues of the coast of Great
Britain, shall be forfeited, and every person using or rowing in
such boat shall forfeit &pound;40.&rdquo;

These prohibitions were, in 1779, in respect of boats to row
with more than six oars, extended to all other English counties;
the port of Bristol only excepted.
As for smuggling craft captured with smuggled goods the way of
the revenue authorities with such was drastic.&nbsp; They were
sawn in three pieces, and then thoroughly broken up.
The futility of these extraordinary steps is emphasised by the
report of the Commissioners of Customs to the Treasury in 1733,
that immense smuggling operations were being conducted in Kent,
Sussex, Essex, and Suffolk.&nbsp; In twelve months, this report
declared, 54,000 lb. of tea and 123,000 gallons of brandy had
been seized, and still, in spite of these tremendous losses, the
spirit of the smugglers was unbroken, and smuggling was
increasing.&nbsp; An additional force of 106 Dragoons was asked
for, to stiffen that of 185 already patrolling those coasts.
It was clearly required, with the utmost urgency, for such a
mere handful of troops spread over this extended seaboard could
scarce be considered a sufficient backing for the civil force, in
view of the determined encounters continually taking place, in
which the recklessness and daring of the smugglers knew no
bounds.&nbsp; Thus, in June 1733, the officers of customs at
Newhaven, attempting to seize ten horses laden with tea, <a
name="page29">p. 29at Cuckmere,
were opposed by about thirty men, armed with pistols and
blunderbusses, who fired on the officers, took them prisoners,
and kept them under guard until the goods were safely carried
off.
In August of the same year the riding-officers, observing
upwards of twenty smugglers at Greenhay, most of them on
horseback, pluckily essayed to do their duty and seize the goods,
but the smugglers fell furiously upon them, and with clubs
knocked one off his horse, severely wounded him, and confined him
for an hour, while the run was completed.&nbsp; Of his companions
no more is heard.&nbsp; They probably&mdash;to phrase it
delicately&mdash;went for assistance.
In July 1735, customs officers of the port of Arundel,
watching the coast, expecting goods to be run from a hovering
smuggler craft, were discovered by a gang of more than twenty
armed smugglers, anxiously waiting for the landing, and not
disposed for an all-night trial of endurance in that waiting
game.&nbsp; They accordingly seized the officers and confined
them until some boatloads of contraband had been landed and
conveyed away on horseback.&nbsp; In the same month, at
Kingston-by-the-Sea, between Brighton and Shoreham, some
officers, primed with information of a forthcoming run of brandy,
and seeking it, found as well ten smugglers with pistols.&nbsp;
Although the smugglers were bold and menacing, the customs men on
this occasion had the better of it, for they seized and duly
impounded the brandy.
p. 30A more
complicated affair took place on December 6th of the same year,
when some customs officers of Newhaven met a large, well-armed
gang of smugglers, who surrounded them and held them prisoners
for an hour and a half.&nbsp; The same gang then fell in with
another party, consisting of three riding-officers and six
Dragoons, and were bold enough to attack them.&nbsp; Foolish
enough, we must also add; for they got the worst of the
encounter, and, fleeing in disorder, were pursued;
five&mdash;armed with pistols, swords, and cutlasses, and
provided with twelve horses&mdash;being captured.
A fatal encounter took place at Bulverhythe, between Hastings
and Bexhill, in March 1737.&nbsp; It is best read of in the
anonymous letter written to the Commissioners of Customs by a
person who, for fear of the smuggling gangs, was afraid to
disclose his real name, and subscribed himself
&ldquo;Goring.&rdquo;&nbsp; The letter&mdash;whose cold-blooded
informing, the work evidently of an educated, but cruel-minded
person, is calculated to make any reader of generous instincts
shiver&mdash;is to be found among the customs correspondence, in
the Treasury Papers.
&ldquo;May it please [your] Honours,&mdash;It is
not unknown to your Lordships of the late battle between the
Smuglers and Officers at Bulverhide; and in relation to that
Business, if your Honours but please to advise in the News
Papers, that this is expected off, I will send a List of the
names of p.
31the Persons that were at that Business, and the
places&rsquo; names where they are usually and mostly
resident.&nbsp; Cat (Morten&rsquo;s man) fired first, Morten was
the second that fired; the soldiers fired and killed Collison,
wounded Pigon, who is since dead; William Weston was wounded, but
like to recover.&nbsp; Young Mr. Bowra was not there, but his men
and horses were; from your Honours&rsquo;
&ldquo;Dutifull and Most faithfull
servant,
&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Goring.
&ldquo;There was no foreign persons at this Business, but all
were Sussex men, and may easily be spoke with.
&ldquo;This [is] the seventh time Morten&rsquo;s people have
workt this winter, and have not lost anything but one
half-hundred [of tea] they gave to a Dragoon and one officer they
met with the first of this winter; and the Hoo company have lost
no goods, although they constantly work, and at home too, since
they lost the seventy hundred-weight.&nbsp; When once the
Smuglers are drove from home they will soon all be taken.&nbsp;
Note, that some say it was Gurr that fired first.&nbsp; You must
well secure Cat, or else your Honours will soon lose the man; the
best way will be to send for him up to London, for he knows the
whole Company, and hath been Morten&rsquo;s servant two
years.&nbsp; There were several young Chaps with the Smuglers,
whom, when taken, will soon discover the whole Company.&nbsp; The
number was twenty-six men.&nbsp; Mack&rsquo;s horses,
Morten&rsquo;s, and Hoak&rsquo;s, were killed, <a
name="page32">p. 32and they lost
not half their goods.&nbsp; They have sent for more goods, and
twenty-nine horses set out from Groombridge this day, about four
in the afternoon, and all the men well armed with long guns.
&ldquo;And if I hear this is received, I will send your
Honours the Places names where your Honours will intercep the
Smuglers as they go to Market with their Goods, but it must be
done by Soldiers, for they go stronger now than ever.&nbsp; And
as for Mr. Gabriel Tompkin, Supervisor of Dartford, there can be
good reason given that Jacob Walter brought him Goods for three
years last past, and it is likewise no dispute of that matter
amongst allmost all the Smuglers.&nbsp; The Bruces and Jacob
fought about that matter and parted Company&rsquo;s, and Mr.
Tompkin was allway, as most people know, a villain when a Smugler
and likewise Officer.&nbsp; He never was concern&rsquo;d with any
Body but Jacob, and now Jacob has certainly done with
Smugling.&nbsp; I shall not trouble your Honours with any more
Letters if I do not hear from this, and I do assure your Honours
what I now write is truth.
&ldquo;There are some Smuglers with a good sum of money, and
they may pay for taking; as Thomas Darby, Edward King, John
Mackdanie, and others that are rich.
&ldquo;The Hoo Company might have been all ruined when they
lost their goods; the Officers and Soldiers knew them all, but
they were not prosecuted, as [they] was not at Groombridge, when
some time since a Custom House Officer <span
class="pagenum">p. 33took some Tea and Arms too in
Bowra&rsquo;s house at Groombridge.
&ldquo;The first of this Winter, the Groombridge Smuglers were
forced to carry their goods allmost all up to Rushmore Hill and
Cester Mark, which some they do now, but Tea sells quick in
London now, and Chaps from London come down to Groombridge
allmost every day, as they used to do last Winter.&nbsp; When
once they come to be drove from home, they will be put to great
inconveniences, when they are from their friends and will lose
more Goods than they do now, and be at more Charges.&nbsp; Do but
take up some of the Servants, they will soon rout the Masters,
for the Servants are all poor.
&ldquo;Young Bowra&rsquo;s House cost &pound;500 building, and
he will pay for looking up.
&ldquo;Morten and Bowra sold, last Winter, some-ways, about
3,000 [lb.] weight a week.&rdquo;

We hear nothing further of &ldquo;Goring,&rdquo; and there is
nothing to show who was the person whose cold malignance appears
horribly in every line of his communication.&nbsp; Any action
that may have been officially taken upon it is also hidden from
us.&nbsp; But we may at least gather from it that the master-men,
the employers of the actual smugglers of the goods, were in a
considerable way of business, and already making very large
profits.&nbsp; We see, too, that the smuggling industry was even
then well on towards being a powerful organisation.
p. 34Still
sterner legislative methods were, accordingly, in the opinion of
the authorities, called for, and the Act of Indemnity of 1736 was
the first result.&nbsp; This was a peculiarly mean and despicable
measure, even for a Revenue Act.&nbsp; There is this
excuse&mdash;although a small one&mdash;for it; that the
Government was increasingly pressed for money, and that the
enormous leakage of customs dues might possibly in some degree be
lessened by stern and not very high-minded laws.&nbsp; By this
Act it was provided that smugglers who desired (whether on trial
or not) to obtain a free pardon for past offences, might do so by
fully disclosing them; at the same time giving the names of their
fellows.&nbsp; The especial iniquity of this lamentable example
of frantic legislation, striking as it did at the very
foundations of character in the creation of the informer and the
sneak, is a sad instance of the moral obliquity to which a
Government under stress of circumstances can descend.
The Act further proceeded to deal with backsliders who, having
purged themselves as above, again resumed their evil courses, and
it made the ways of transgressors very hard indeed; for, when
captured, they were charged with not only their present offence,
but also with that for which they had compounded with the
Dev&mdash; that is to say, with the law.&nbsp; And, being so
charged, and duly convicted, their case was desperate; for if the
previous offence had carried with it, on conviction, a sentence
of transportation (as many smuggling offences did: among them the
carrying p.
35of firearms by three, or more men, while engaged in
smuggling goods), the second brought a sentence of death.
With regard to the position of the pardoned smuggler who had
earned his pardon by thus peaching on his fellows, it is not too
much to say&mdash;certainly so far as the more ferocious
smuggling gangs of Kent and Sussex were concerned&mdash;that by
so doing he had already earned his capital sentence; for the
temper of these men was such, and the risks they were made to run
by these ferocious Acts were so great, that they would
not&mdash;and, in a way of looking at these things, could
not&mdash;suffer an informer to live.
Thus, even the additional inducements offered to informers by
statute&mdash;including a reward of &pound;50 each for the
discovery and conviction of two or more accomplices&mdash;very
generally failed to obtain results.
Many other items of unexampled severity were included in this
Act, and in the yet more drastic measures of 1745 and the
following year.&nbsp; By these it was provided that persons found
loitering within five miles of the sea-coast, or any navigable
river, might be considered suspicious persons; and they ran the
risk of being taken before a magistrate, who was empowered, on
any such person being unable to give a satisfactory account of
himself, to commit him to the House of Correction, there to be
whipped and kept at hard labour for any period not exceeding one
month.
p. 36In
1746, assembling to run contraband goods was made a crime
punishable with death as a felon, and counties were made liable
for revenue losses.&nbsp; Smuggled goods seized and afterwards
rescued entailed a fine of &pound;200 upon the county; a revenue
officer beaten by smugglers cost the county &pound;40; or if
killed, &pound;100; with the provision that the county should be
exempt if the offenders were convicted within six months.
As regards the offenders themselves, if they failed to
surrender within forty days and were afterwards captured, the
person who captured them was entitled to a reward of
&pound;500.
Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s definition of a smuggler appears on the
title-page of the present volume.&nbsp; It is not a flattering
testimonial to character; but, on the other hand, his opinion of
a Commissioner of Excise&mdash;and such were the sworn enemies of
smugglers&mdash;was much more unfavourable.&nbsp; Such an one was
bracketed by the doctor with a political pamphleteer, or what he
termed &ldquo;a scribbler for a party,&rdquo; as one of
&ldquo;the two lowest of human beings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without the
context in which these judgments are now placed, it would be more
than a little difficult to trace their reasoning, which sounds as
little sensible as it would be to declare at one and the same
time a burglar to be a dangerous pest and a policeman a useless
ornament.&nbsp; But if smugglers can be proved from these pages
wicked and reckless men, so undoubtedly shall we find the
Commissioners of Excise and Customs, in their several spheres,
appealing to the p.
37basest of human instincts, and thus abundantly worthy of
Johnson&rsquo;s censure.
The shifts and expedients of the Commissioners of Customs for
the suppression of smuggling were many and ingenious, and none
was more calculated to perform the maximum of service to the
Revenue with the minimum of cost than the commissioning of
privateers, authorised to search for, to chase, and to capture if
possible any smuggling craft.&nbsp; &ldquo;Minimum of cost&rdquo;
is indeed not the right expression for use here, for the cost and
risks to the customs establishment were nil.&nbsp; It
should be said here that, although the Acts of Parliament
directed against smuggling were of the utmost stringency, they
were not always applied with all the severity possible to be
used; and, on the other hand, customs officers and the commanders
of revenue cutters were well advised to guard against any excess
of zeal in carrying out their instructions.&nbsp; To chase and
capture a vessel that every one knew perfectly well to be a
smuggler, and then to find no contraband aboard, because, as a
matter of fact, it had been carefully sunk at some point where it
could easily be recovered at leisure, was not only not the way to
promotion as a zealous officer; but was, on the contrary, in the
absence of proof that contraband had been carried, a certain way
to official disfavour.&nbsp; And it was also, as many officers
found to their cost, the way into actions at law, with resultant
heavy damages not infrequently awarded against them.&nbsp; It
was, indeed, a scandal that <span
class="pagenum">p. 38these public servants, who assuredly
rarely ever brought to, or overhauled, a vessel without
reasonable and probable cause, should have been subject to such
contingencies, without remedy of any kind.
The happy idea of licensing private adventurers to build and
equip vessels to make private war upon smuggling craft, and to
capture them and their cargoes, was an extension of the original
plan of issuing letters of marque to owners of vessels for the
purpose of inflicting loss upon an enemy&rsquo;s commerce; but
persons intending to engage upon this private warfare against
smuggling had, in the first instance, to give security to the
Commissioners of a diligence in the cause thus undertaken, and to
enter into business details respecting the cargoes
captured.&nbsp; It was, however, not infrequently found, in
practice, that these privateers very often took to smuggling on
their own account, and that, under the protective cloak of their
ostensible affairs, they did a very excellent business; while, to
complete this picture of failure, those privateers that really
did keep to their licensed trade generally contrived to lose
money and to land their owners into bankruptcy.

class="smcap">The Hawkhurst Gang&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Organised Attack on Goudhurst&mdash;<span
class="smcap">The &ldquo;Smugglers&rsquo; Song&rdquo;
But the smugglers of Kent and
Sussex were by far the most formidable of all the
&ldquo;free-traders&rdquo; in England, and were not easily to be
suppressed.&nbsp; Smuggling, export and import, off those coasts
was naturally heavier than elsewhere, for there the Channel was
narrower, and runs more easily effected.&nbsp; The interests
involved were consequently much greater, and the organisation of
the smugglers, from the master-men to the labourers, more nearly
perfect.&nbsp; To interfere with any of the several confederacies
into which these men were banded for the furtherance of their
illicit trade was therefore a matter of considerable danger, and,
well knowing the terror into which they had thrown the
country-side, they presumed upon it, to extend their activities
into other, and even less reputable, doings.&nbsp; The intervals
between carrying tubs, and otherwise working for the
master-smugglers became filled, towards the middle of the
eighteenth century, with acts of highway <a
name="page40">p. 40robbery and
house-breaking, and, in the home counties, at any rate, smuggling
proved often to be only the first step in a career of crime.
Among these powerful and terrorising confederacies, the
Hawkhurst gang was pre-eminent.&nbsp; The constitution of it was,
necessarily, a matter of inexact information, for the officers
and the rank and file of such societies are mentioned by no
minute-books or reports.&nbsp; But one of its principals was,
without question, Arthur Gray, or Grey, who was one of those
&ldquo;Sea Cocks&rdquo; after whom Seacox Heath, near Hawkhurst,
in Kent, is supposed to be named.&nbsp; He was a man who did
things on, for those times, a grand scale, and was said to be
worth &pound;10,000.&nbsp; He had built on that then lonely ridge
of ground, overlooking at a great height the Weald of Kent, large
store houses&mdash;a kind of illicit &ldquo;bonded
warehouses&rdquo;&mdash;for smuggled goods, and made the spot a
distributing centre.&nbsp; That all these facts should have been
contemporaneously known, and Gray&rsquo;s store not have been
raided by the Revenue, points to an almost inconceivable state of
lawlessness.&nbsp; The buildings were in after years known as
&ldquo;Gray&rsquo;s Folly&rdquo;; but it was left for modern
times to treat the spot in a truly sportive way: when Lord
Goschen, who built the modern mansion of Seacox Heath on the site
of the smuggler&rsquo;s place of business, became Chancellor of
the Exchequer.&nbsp; If the unquiet ghosts of the old smugglers
ever revisit their old haunts, how weird must have been the
ironic laughter of Gray at finding this <a
name="page41">p. 41the home of
the chief financial functionary of the Government!




In December 1744 the gang were responsible for the impudent
abduction of a customs officer and three men who had attempted to
seize a run of goods at Shoreham.&nbsp; They wounded the officer
and carried the four off to Hawkhurst, where they tied two of
them, who had formerly been smugglers and had ratted to the
customs service, to trees, whipped them almost to death, and then
took them down to the coast again and shipped them to
France.&nbsp; A reward of &pound;50 was offered, but never
claimed.
To exhume yet another incident from the forgotten doings of
the time: In March 1745 a band of twelve or fourteen smugglers
assaulted three custom-house officers whom they found in an
alehouse at Grinstead Green, wounded them in a barbarous manner,
and robbed them of their watches and money.
In the same year a gang entered a farmhouse near Sheerness, in
Sheppey, and stole a great quantity of wool, valued at
&pound;1,500.&nbsp; A week later &pound;300 worth of wool, which
may or may not have been a portion of that stolen, was seized
upon a vessel engaged in smuggling it from Sheerness, and eight
men were secured.
The long immunity of the Hawkhurst Gang from serious
interference inevitably led to its operations being extended in
every direction, and the law-abiding populace of Kent and Sussex
eventually found themselves dominated by a great <a
name="page42">p. 42number of
fearless marauders, whose will for a time was a greater law than
the law of the land.&nbsp; None could take legal action against
them without going hourly in personal danger, or in fear of
house, crops, wheat-stacks, hay-ricks, or stock being burnt or
otherwise injured.
The village of Goudhurst, a picturesque spot situated upon a
hill on the borders of Kent and Sussex, was the first place to
resent this ignoble subserviency.&nbsp; The villagers and the
farmers round about were wearied of having their horses
commandeered by mysterious strangers for the carrying of
contraband goods that did not concern them, and were determined
no longer to have their houses raided with violence for money or
anything else that took the fancy of these fellows.
They had at last found themselves faced with the alternatives,
almost incredible in a civilised country, of either deserting
their houses and leaving their property at the mercy of these
marauders, or of uniting to oppose by force their lawless
inroads.&nbsp; The second alternative was chosen; a paper
expressive of their abhorrence of the conduct of the smugglers,
and of the determination to oppose them was drawn up and
subscribed to by a considerable number of persons, who assumed
the style of the &ldquo;Goudhurst Band of Militia.&rdquo;&nbsp;
At their head was a young man named Sturt, who had recently been
a soldier.&nbsp; He it was who had persuaded the villagers to be
men, and make some spirited resistance.
News of this unexpected stand on the part of <a
name="page43">p. 43these
hitherto meek-spirited people soon reached the ears of the
dreaded Hawkhurst Gang, who contrived to waylay one of the
&ldquo;Militia,&rdquo; and, by means of torture and imprisonment,
extorted from him a full disclosure of the plans and intentions
of his colleagues.&nbsp; They swore the man not to take up arms
against them, and then let him go; telling him to inform the
Goudhurst people that they would, on a certain day named, attack
the place, murder every one in it, and then burn it to the
ground.
Sturt, on receiving this impudent message, assembled his
&ldquo;Militia,&rdquo; and, pointing out to them the danger of
the situation, employed them in earnest preparations.&nbsp; While
some were sent to collect firearms, others were set to casting
bullets and making cartridges, and to providing defences.
Punctually at the time appointed (a piece of very bad policy
on their part, by which they would appear to have been fools as
well as rogues) the gang appeared, headed by Thomas Kingsmill,
and fired a volley into the village, over the entrenchments
made.&nbsp; The embattled villagers replied, some from the houses
and roof-tops, and others from the leads of the church-tower;
when George Kingsmill, brother of the leading spirit in the
attack, was shot dead.&nbsp; He is alluded to in contemporary
accounts as the person who had killed a man at Hurst Green, a few
miles distant.
In the firing that for some time continued two others of the
smugglers, one Barnet Wollit <span
class="pagenum">p. 44and a man whose name is not
mentioned, were killed and several wounded.&nbsp; The rest then
fled, pursued by the valorous &ldquo;Militia,&rdquo; who took a
few prisoners, afterwards handed over by them to the law, and
executed.
Surprisingly little is heard of this&mdash;as we, in these
more equable times, are prone to think it&mdash;extraordinary
incident.&nbsp; A stray paragraph or so in the chronicles of the
time is met with, and that is all.&nbsp; It was only one of the
usual lawless doings of the age.
But to-day the stranger in the village may chance, if he
inquires a little into the history of the place, to hear wild and
whirling accounts of this famous event; and, if he be at all
enterprising, will find in the parish registers of burials this
one piece of documentary evidence toward the execution done that
day:
&ldquo;1747, Ap. 20, George Kingsmill, Dux sclerum
glande plumbeo emisso, cecidit.&rdquo;

All these things, moreover, are duly enshrined, amid much
fiction, in the pages of G. P. R. James&rsquo;s novel, &ldquo;The
Smuggler.&rdquo;
And still the story of outrage continued.&nbsp; On August
14th, 1747, a band of twenty swaggering smugglers rode,
well-armed and reckless, into Rye and halted at the &ldquo;Red
Lion&rdquo; inn, where they remained drinking until they grew
rowdy and violent.
Coming into the street again, they discharged their pistols at
random, and, as the old account of these things concludes,
&ldquo;observing James <span
class="pagenum">p. 45Marshall, a young man, too curious of
their behaviour, carried him off, and he has not since been heard
of.&rdquo;
History tells us nothing of the fate of that unfortunate young
man; but, from other accounts of the bloodthirsty characters of
these Kentish and Sussex malefactors, we imagine the very
worst.
Others, contemporary with them&mdash;if, indeed, they were not
the same men, as seems abundantly possible&mdash;captured two
revenue officers near Seaford, and, securely pinning them down to
the beach at low-water mark, so that they could not move, left
them there, so that, when the tide rose, they were drowned.
Again, on September 14th of this same year, 1747, a smuggler
named Austin, violently resisting arrest, shot a sergeant dead
with a blunderbuss at Maidstone.
In &ldquo;The Smugglers&rsquo; Song&rdquo; Mr. Rudyard Kipling
has vividly reconstructed those old times of dread, when, night
and day, the numerous and well-armed bodies of smugglers openly
traversed the country, terrorising every one.&nbsp; To look too
curiously at these high-handed ruffians was, as we have already
seen, an offence, and the most cautious among the rustics made
quite sure of not incurring their high displeasure&mdash;and
incidentally of not being called upon by the revenue authorities
as witnesses to the identity of any among their number&mdash;by
turning their faces the other way when the free-traders
passed.&nbsp; Mothers, <span
class="pagenum">p. 46too, were careful to bid their little
ones on the Marshland roads, or in the very streets of New
Romney, to turn their faces to the hedge-side, or to the wall,
&ldquo;when the gentlemen went by.&rdquo;&nbsp; And&mdash;
If you wake at midnight, and hear a horse&rsquo;s
feet,
Don&rsquo;t go drawing back the blind, or looking in the
street;
Them that ask no questions isn&rsquo;t told a lie,
Watch the wall, my darling, while the gentlemen go by.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five and twenty ponies<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trotting through the
dark&mdash;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandy for the parson;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Baccy for the clerk;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laces for a lady; letters for a
spy,
And watch the wall, my darling, while the gentlemen go by.

47CHAPTER IV
<span
class="smcap">The &ldquo;Murders by Smugglers&rdquo; in
Hampshire
The most outstanding chapter in the
whole history of smuggling is that of the cold-blooded
&ldquo;Murders by Smugglers&rdquo; which stained the annals of
the southern counties in the mid-eighteenth century with
peculiarly revolting deeds that have in them nothing of romance;
nothing but a long-drawn story of villainy and fiendish
cruelty.&nbsp; It is a story that long made dwellers in solitary
situations shiver with apprehension, especially if they owned
relatives connected in any way with the hated customs
officers.
This grim chapter of horrors, upon which the historian can
dwell only with loathing, and with pity for himself in being
brought to the telling of it, was the direct outcome of the
lawless and almost unchecked doings of the Hawkhurst Gang, whose
daring grew continually with their long-continued success in
terrorising the countryside.
The beginnings of this affair are found in an expedition
entered upon by a number of the gang in September 1747, in
Guernsey, where they purchased a considerable quantity of tea, <a
name="page48">p. 48for smuggling
into this country.&nbsp; Unfortunately for their enterprise, they
fell in with a revenue cutter, commanded by one Captain Johnson,
who pursued and captured their vessel, took it into the port of
Poole, and lodged the tea in the custom-house there.
The smugglers were equally incensed and dismayed at this
disaster, the loss being a very heavy one; and they resolved,
rather than submit to it, to go in an armed force and recover the
goods.&nbsp; Accordingly a mounted body of them, to the number of
sixty, well provided with firearms and other weapons, assembled
in what is described as &ldquo;Charlton Forest,&rdquo; probably
Chalton Downs, between Petersfield and Poole, and thence
proceeded on their desperate errand.&nbsp; Thirty of them, it was
agreed, should go to the attack, while the other thirty should
take up positions as scouts along the various roads, to watch for
riding-officers, or for any military force, and so alarm, or
actively assist, if needs were, the attacking party.
It was in the midnight between October 6th and 7th that this
advance party reached Poole, broke open the custom-house on the
quay, and removed all the captured tea&mdash;thirty-seven
hundredweight, valued at &pound;500&mdash;except one bag of about
five pounds weight.&nbsp; They returned in the morning, in
leisurely fashion, through Fordingbridge; the affair apparently
so public that hundreds of people were assembled in the streets
of that little town to see these daring fellows pass.




p. 49Among
these spectators was one Daniel Chater, a shoemaker, who
recognised among this cavalcade of smugglers a certain John
Diamond, with whom he had formerly worked in the harvest
field.&nbsp; Diamond shook hands with him as he passed, and threw
him a bag of tea.
It was not long before a proclamation was issued offering
rewards for the identification or apprehension of any persons
concerned in this impudent raid, and Diamond was in the meanwhile
arrested on suspicion at Chichester.&nbsp; Chater, who seems to
have been a foolish, gossiping fellow, saying he knew Diamond and
saw him go by with the gang, became an object of considerable
interest to his neighbours at Fordingbridge, who, having seen
that present of a bag of tea&mdash;a very considerable present as
the price of tea then ran&mdash;no doubt thought he knew more of
the affair than he cared to tell.&nbsp; At any rate, these things
came to the knowledge of the Collector of Customs at Southampton,
and the upshot of several interviews and some correspondence with
him was that Chater agreed to go in company with one William
Galley, an officer of excise, to Major Battin, a Justice of the
Peace and a Commissioner of Customs at Chichester, to be examined
as to his readiness and ability to identify Diamond, whose
punishment, on conviction, would be, under the savage laws of
that time, death.
Chater, in short, had offered himself as that detestable
thing, a hired informer: a creature <span
class="pagenum">p. 50all right-minded men abhor, and whom
the smugglers of that age visited, whenever found, with
persecution and often with the same extremity to which the law
doomed themselves.
The ill-fated pair set out on Sunday, February 14th, on
horseback, and, calling on their way at Havant, were directed by
a friend of Chater&rsquo;s at that place to go by way of
Stanstead, near Rowlands Castle.&nbsp; They soon, however, missed
their way, and calling at Leigh, at the &ldquo;New Inn,&rdquo; to
refresh and to inquire the road, met there three men, George and
Thomas Austin, and their brother-in-law, one Mr. Jenkes, who
accompanied them to Rowlands Castle, where they all drew rein at
the &ldquo;White Hart&rdquo; public-house, kept by a Mrs.
Elizabeth Payne, a widow, who had two sons in the village,
blacksmiths, and both reputed smugglers.
Some rum was called for, and was being drank, when Mrs. Payne,
taking George Austin aside, told him she was afraid these two
strangers were after no good; they had come, she suspected, with
intent to do some injury to the smugglers.&nbsp; Such was the
state of the rural districts in those times that the appearance
of two strangers was of itself a cause for distrust; but when, in
addition, there was the damning fact that one of them wore the
uniform of a riding-officer of excise, suspicion became almost a
certainty.
But to her remarks George Austin replied she need not be
alarmed, the strangers were <span
class="pagenum">p. 51only carrying a letter to Major
Battin, on some ordinary official business.
This explanation, however, served only to increase her
suspicions, for what more likely than that this business with a
man who was, among other things, a highly placed customs
official, was connected in some way with these recent notorious
happenings?
To make sure, Mrs. Payne sent privately one of her sons, who
was then in the house, for William Jackson and William Carter,
two men deeply involved with smuggling, who lived near at
hand.&nbsp; In the meanwhile Chater and Galley wanted to be gone
upon their journey, and asked for their horses.&nbsp; Mrs. Payne,
to keep them until Jackson and Carter should arrive, told them
the man who had the key of the stables was gone for a while, but
would return presently.
As the unsuspecting men waited, gossiping and drinking, the
two smugglers entered.&nbsp; Mrs. Payne drew them aside and
whispered her suspicions; at the same time advising Mr. George
Austin to go away, as she respected him, and was unwilling that
any harm should come to him.
It is thus sufficiently clear that, even at this early stage,
some very serious mischief was contemplated.
Mr. George Austin, being a prudent, if certainly not also an
honest, man, did as he was advised.&nbsp; Thomas Austin, his
brother, who does not appear to have in the same degree commanded
the landlady&rsquo;s respect, was not warned, and <a
name="page52">p. 52remained,
together with his brother-in-law.&nbsp; To have won the
reader&rsquo;s respect also, she should, at the very least of it,
have warned them as well.&nbsp; But as this was obviously not a
school of morals, we will not labour the point, and will bid Mr.
George Austin, with much relief, &ldquo;goodbye.&rdquo;
Mrs. Payne&rsquo;s other son then entered, bringing with him
four more smugglers: William Steel, Samuel Downer, alias
Samuel Howard, alias &ldquo;Little Sam,&rdquo; Edmund
Richards, and Henry Sheerman, alias &ldquo;Little
Harry.&rdquo;
After a while Jackson took Chater aside into the yard, and
asked him after Diamond; whereupon the simple-minded man let fall
the object of his and his companion&rsquo;s journey.
While they were talking, Galley, suspecting Chater would be in
some way indiscreet, came out and asked him to rejoin them;
whereupon Jackson, with a horrible oath, struck him a violent
blow in the face, knocking him down.
Galley then rushed into the house, Jackson following
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a King&rsquo;s officer,&rdquo; exclaimed
the unfortunate Galley, &ldquo;and cannot put up with such
treatment.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You a King&rsquo;s officer!&rdquo; replied Jackson,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a King&rsquo;s officer of you; and for a
quartern of gin I&rsquo;ll serve you so again!&rdquo;
The others interposed, one of the Paynes exclaiming,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a fool; do you know what you are
doing?&rdquo;
Galley and Chater grew very uneasy, and <a
name="page53">p. 53again wanted
to be going; but the company present, including Jackson, pressed
them to stay, Jackson declaring he was sorry for what had
passed.&nbsp; The entire party then sat down to more drink, until
Galley and Chater were overcome by drunkenness and were sent to
sleep in an adjoining room.&nbsp; Thomas Austin and Mr. Jenkes
were by this time also hopelessly drunk; but as they had no
concern with the smugglers, nor the smugglers with them, they
drop out of this narrative.
When Galley and Chater lay in their drunken sleep the
compromising letters in their pockets were found and read, and
the men present formed themselves into a kind of committee to
decide what should be done with their enemies, as they thought
them.&nbsp; John Race and Richard Kelly then came in, and Jackson
and Carter told them they had got the old rogue, the shoemaker of
Fordingbridge, who was going to give an information against John
Diamond the shepherd, then in custody at Chichester.
They then consulted what was best to be done to their two
prisoners, when William Steel proposed to take them both to a
well, a little way from the house, and to murder them and throw
them in.&nbsp; Less ferocious proposals were made&mdash;to send
them over to France; but when it became obvious that they would
return and give the evidence after all, the thoughts of the seven
men present reverted to murder.&nbsp; At this juncture the wives
of Jackson and Carter, <span
class="pagenum">p. 54who had entered the house, cried,
&ldquo;Hang the dogs, for they came here to hang us!&rdquo;
Another proposition that was made&mdash;to imprison the two in
some safe place until they knew what would be Diamond&rsquo;s
fate, and for each of the smugglers to subscribe threepence a
week for their keep&mdash;was immediately scouted; and instantly
the brutal fury of these ruffians was aroused by Jackson, who,
going into the room where the unfortunate men were lying, spurred
them on their foreheads with the heavy spurs of his riding-boots,
and, having thus effectually wakened them, whipped them into the
kitchen of the inn until they were streaming with blood.&nbsp;
Then, taking them outside, the gang lifted them on to a horse,
one behind the other, and, tying their hands and legs together,
lashed them with heavy whips along the road, crying, &ldquo;Whip
them, cut them, slash them, damn them!&rdquo; one of their
number, Edmund Richards, with cocked pistol in hand, swearing he
would shoot any person through the head who should mention
anything of what he saw or heard.
From Rowlands Castle, past Wood Ashes, Goodthorpe Deane, and
to Lady Holt Park, this scourging was continued through the
night, until the wretched men were three parts dead.&nbsp; At two
o&rsquo;clock in the morning this gruesome procession reached the
Portsmouth Road at Rake, where the foremost members of the party
halted at what was then the &ldquo;Red Lion&rdquo; inn, long
since that time retired into private life, and now a <a
name="page55">p. 55humble
cottage.&nbsp; It was kept in those days by one Scardefield, who
was no stranger to their kind, nor unused to the purchase and
storing of smuggled spirits.&nbsp; Here they knocked and rattled
at the door until Scardefield was obliged to get out of bed and
open to them.&nbsp; Galley, still alive, was thrust into an
outhouse, while the band, having roused the landlord and procured
drink, caroused in the parlour of the inn.&nbsp; Chater they
carried in with them; and when Scardefield stood horrified at
seeing so ghastly a figure of a man, all bruised and broken, and
spattered with blood, they told him a specious tale of an
engagement they had had with the King&rsquo;s officers: that here
was a comrade, wounded, and another, dead or dying, in his
brew-house.




Chater they presently carried to an outhouse of the cottage of
a man named Mills, not far off, and then returned for more drink
and discussion of what was to be done with Galley, whom they
decided to bury in Harting Combe.&nbsp; So, while it was yet
dark, they carried him down from the ridge on which Rake stands,
into the valley, and, digging a grave in a fox-earth by the light
of a lantern, shovelled the dirt over him, without inquiring too
closely whether their victim were alive or dead.&nbsp; That he
was not dead at that time became evident when his body was
discovered eight months later, hands raised to his face, as
though to prevent the earth from suffocating him.
p. 56The
whole of the next day this evil company sat drinking in the
&ldquo;Red Lion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Richard Mills, son of the man in
whose turf-shed Chater lay chained by the leg, passing by, they
hailed him and told him of what they had done; whereupon he said
he would, if he had had the doing of it, have flung the man down
Harting Combe headlong and broken his neck.
On this Monday night they all returned home, lest their
continued absence might be remarked by the neighbours; agreeing
to meet again at Rake on the Wednesday evening, to consider how
they might best put an end to Chater.
When Wednesday night had come this council of murderers,
reinforced by others, and numbering in all fourteen, assembled
accordingly.&nbsp; Dropping into the &ldquo;Red Lion&rdquo; one
by one, it was late at night before they had all gathered.
They decided, after some argument, to dispatch him forthwith,
and, going down to the turf-shed where he had lain all this
while, suffering agonies from the cruel usage to which he had
been subjected, they unchained him.&nbsp; Richard Mills at first
had proposed to finish him there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;load a gun with two or three bullets, lay it upon
a stand with the muzzle of the piece levelled at his head, and,
after having tied a long string to the trigger, we will all go
off to the butt-end, and, each of us taking hold of the string,
pull it all together; thus we shall be all equally guilty of his
death, and it will be impossible for any one of us to charge the
rest with his murder, without <span
class="pagenum">p. 57accusing himself of the same crime;
and none can pretend to lessen or to mitigate his guilt by saying
he was only an accessory, since all will be
principals.&rdquo;




Thus Richard Mills, according to the story of these things
told in horrid detail (together with a full report of the
subsequent trial) by the author of the contemporary
&ldquo;Genuine History.&rdquo;&nbsp; The phraseology of the
man&rsquo;s coldly logical proposals is, of course, that of the
author himself; since it is not possible that a Sussex rustic of
over a hundred and sixty years ago would have spoken in literary
English.
Mills&rsquo;s proposition was not accepted.&nbsp; It seemed to
the others too merciful and expeditious a method of putting an
end to Chater&rsquo;s misery.&nbsp; They had grown as epicurean
in torture as the medi&aelig;val hell-hounds who racked and
pinched and burnt for Church and State.&nbsp; They were resolved
he should suffer as much and as long as they could eke out his
life, as a warning to all other informers.
The proposal that found most favour was that they should take
him to Harris&rsquo;s Well, in Lady Holt Park, and throw him
in.
Tapner, one of the recruits to the gang, thereupon inaugurated
the new series of torments by pulling out a large clasp-knife,
and, with a fearful oath, exclaiming, &ldquo;Down on your knees
and go to prayers, for with this knife I will be your
butcher.&rdquo;
Chater, expecting every moment to be his last, knelt down as
he was ordered, and, while he <span
class="pagenum">p. 58was thus praying, Cobby kicked him
from behind, while Tapner in front slashed his face.
The elder Mills, owner of the turf-shed, at this grew alarmed
for his own safety.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take him away,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and do not murder him here.&nbsp; Do it somewhere
else.&rdquo;
They then mounted him on a horse and set out for Lady Holt
Park; Tapner, more cruel, if possible, than the rest, slashing
him with his knife, and whipping him with his whip, all the
way.
It was dead of night by the time they had come to the Park,
where there was a deep dry well.&nbsp; A wooden fence stretched
across the track leading to it, and over this, although it was in
places broken and could easily have been crawled through, they
made their victim climb.&nbsp; Tapner then pulled a rope out of
his pocket and tied it round Chater&rsquo;s neck, and so pushed
him over the opening of the well, where he hung, slowly
strangling.
But by this time they were anxious to get home, and could
afford no more time for these luxuries of cruelty, so they
dropped him to the bottom of the well, imagining he would be
quite killed by the fall.&nbsp; Unfortunately for Chater, he was
remarkably tenacious of life, and was heard groaning there, where
he had fallen.
They dared not leave him thus, lest any one passing should
hear his cries, and went and roused a gardener, one William
Combleach, who lived a little way off, and borrowed a ladder,
telling him one of their companions had fallen into <a
name="page59">p.
59Harris&rsquo;s Well.&nbsp; With this ladder they
intended to descend the well and finally dispatch Chater; but,
seeing they could not manage to lower the ladder, they were
reduced to finding some huge stones and two great gateposts,
which they then flung down, and so ended the unhappy man&rsquo;s
martyrdom.
The problem that next faced the murderers was, how to dispose
of the two horses their victims had been riding.&nbsp; It was
first proposed to put them aboard the next smuggling vessel
returning to France, but that idea was abandoned, on account of
the risk of discovery.&nbsp; It was finally decided to slaughter
them and remove their skins, and this was accordingly done to the
grey that Galley had ridden, and his hide cut up into small
pieces and buried; but, when they came to look for the bay that
Chater had used, they could not find him.

<span
class="smcap">The &ldquo;Murders by Smugglers&rdquo;
continued&mdash;Trial and Execution of
the Murderers&mdash;Further Crimes by
the Hawkhurst Gang
Even in those times two men, and
especially men who had set out upon official business, could not
disappear so utterly as Chater and Galley had done without
comment being aroused, and presently the whole country was
ringing with the news of this mysterious disappearance.&nbsp; The
condition of the country can at once be guessed when it is stated
that no one doubted the hands of the smugglers in this
business.&nbsp; The only question was, in what manner had they
spirited these two men away?&nbsp; Some thought they had been
carried over to France, while others thought, shrewdly enough,
they had been murdered.
But no tidings nor any trace of either Galley or Chater came
to satisfy public curiosity, or to allay official apprehensions,
until some seven months later, when an anonymous letter sent to
&ldquo;a person of distinction,&rdquo; and probably inspired by
the hope of ultimately earning the large reward offered by the
Government for information, hinted that &ldquo;the body of one of
the unfortunate men mentioned in his Majesty&rsquo;s proclamation
was p. 61buried
in the sands in a certain place near Rake.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, sure
enough, when search was made, the body of Galley was found
&ldquo;standing almost upright, with his hands covering his
eyes.&rdquo;
Another letter followed upon this discovery, implicating
William Steel in these doings, and he was immediately
arrested.&nbsp; To save himself, the prisoner turned King&rsquo;s
evidence, and revealed the whole dreadful story.&nbsp; John Race,
among the others concerned, voluntarily surrendered, and was also
admitted as evidence.
One after another, seven of the murderers were arrested in
different parts of the counties of Hants and Surrey, and were
committed to the gaols of Horsham and Newgate, afterwards being
sent to Chichester, where a special Assize was held for the
purpose of overawing the smugglers of the district, and of
impressing them with the majesty and the power of the law, which,
it was desired to show them, would eventually overtake all
evil-doers.
We need not enter into the details of that trial, held on
January 18th, 1749, and reported with painful elaboration by the
author of the &ldquo;Genuine History,&rdquo; together with the
sermon preached in Chichester Cathedral by Dean Ashburnham, who
held forth in the obvious and conventional way of comfortably
beneficed clergy, then and now.
Let it be sufficient to say that all were found guilty, and
all sentenced to be hanged on the following day.
p. 62Six of
them were duly executed, William Jackson, the seventh, dying in
gaol.&nbsp; He had been for a considerable time in ill
health.&nbsp; He was a Roman Catholic and the greatest villain of
the gang, and, like all such, steeped in superstition.&nbsp;
Carefully sewed up in a linen purse in his waistcoat pocket was
found an amulet in French, which, translated, ran as follows:
Ye three Holy Kings,<br
/>
Gaspar, Melchior, Balthasar,
Pray for us now, and in the hour of death.
These papers have touched the three heads of the Holy Kings at
Cologne.
They are to preserve travellers from accidents on the road,
headaches, falling sickness, fevers, witchcraft, all kinds of
mischief, and sudden death.

His body was thrown into a pit on the Broyle, at Chichester,
together with those of Richard Mills, the elder, and
younger.&nbsp; The body of William Carter was hanged in chains
upon the Portsmouth road, near Rake; that of Benjamin Tapner on
Rook&rsquo;s Hill, near Chichester, and those of John Cobby and
John Hammond upon the sea-coast near Selsea Bill, so that they
might be seen for great distances by any contrabandists engaged
in running goods.
Another accomplice, Henry Shurman, or Sheerman, alias
&ldquo;Little Harry,&rdquo; was indicted and tried at East
Grinstead, and, being sentenced to death, was conveyed to Horsham
Gaol by a strong guard of soldiers and hanged at Rake, and
afterwards gibbeted.
In January 1749, a brutal murder was <a
name="page63">p. 63committed at
the &ldquo;Dog and Partridge&rdquo; inn, on Slindon Common, near
Arundel, where Richard Hawkins was whipped and kicked to death on
suspicion of being concerned in stealing two bags of tea,
belonging to one Jerry Curtis.&nbsp; Hawkins was enticed away
from his work at Walberton, on some specious pretext, by Curtis
and John Mills, known as &ldquo;Smoker,&rdquo; and went on
horseback behind Mills to the &ldquo;Dog and Partridge,&rdquo;
where they joined a man named Robb: all these men being
well-known smugglers in that district.&nbsp; Having safely got
Hawkins thus far, they informed him that he was their prisoner,
and proceeded to put him under examination in the parlour of the
inn.&nbsp; There were also present Thomas Winter (afterwards a
witness for the prosecution), and James Reynolds, the
innkeeper.
Hawkins denied having stolen the tea, and said he knew nothing
of the matter, whereupon Curtis replied, &ldquo;Damn you; you do
know, and if you do not confess I will whip you till you do; for,
damn you, I have whipped many a rogue and washed my hands in his
blood.&rdquo;
Reynolds said, &ldquo;Dick, you had better confess; it will be
better for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; But his answer still was, &ldquo;I
know nothing of it.&rdquo;
Reynolds then went out, and Mills and Robb thereupon beat and
kicked Hawkins so ferociously that he cried out that the
Cockrels, his father-in-law, and brother-in-law, who kept an inn
at Yapton, were concerned in it.&nbsp; Curtis and Mills then took
their horses and said they would go <span
class="pagenum">p. 64and fetch them.&nbsp; Going to the
younger Cockrel, Mills entered the house first and called for
some ale.&nbsp; Then Curtis came in and demanded his two bags of
tea, which he said Hawkins had accused him of having.&nbsp;
Cockrel denied having them, and then Curtis beat him with an oak
stick until he was tired.&nbsp; Curtis and Mills then forcibly
took him to where his father was, at Walberton, and thence, with
his father, behind them on their horses, towards Slindon.
Meanwhile, at the &ldquo;Dog and Partridge,&rdquo; Robb and
Winter placed the terribly injured man, Hawkins, in a chair by
the fire, where he died.
Robb and Winter then took their own horses and rode out
towards Yapton, meeting Curtis and Mills on the way, each with a
man behind him.&nbsp; The men, who were the Cockrels, were told
to get off, which they did, and the four others held a whispered
conversation, when Winter told them that Hawkins was dead, and
desired them to do no more mischief.
&ldquo;By God!&rdquo; exclaimed Curtis, &ldquo;we will go
through it now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Winter again urged them to be
content with what had already been done; and Curtis then bade the
two Cockrels return home.
Then they all four rode back to the &ldquo;Dog and
Partridge,&rdquo; where Reynolds was in despair, saying to
Curtis, &ldquo;You have ruined me.&rdquo;




Curtis replied that he would make him amends; and they all
then consulted how to dispose of the body.&nbsp; The first
proposition was to bury it <span
class="pagenum">p. 65in a park close at hand, and to give
out that the smugglers had deported Hawkins to France.&nbsp; But
Reynolds objected.&nbsp; The spot, he said, was too near, and
would soon be found.&nbsp; In the end, they laid the body on a
horse and carried it to Parham Park, twelve miles away, where
they tied large stones to it, and sunk it in a pond.
This crime was in due course discovered, and a proclamation
issued, offering a pardon to any one, not himself concerned in
the murder, nor in the breaking open of the custom-house at
Poole, who should give information that would lead to the capture
and conviction of the offenders.
William Pring, an outlawed smuggler, who had heard some gossip
of this affair among his smuggling acquaintance, and was
apparently wishful of beginning a new life, determined to make a
bid for his pardon for past offences, and, we are told,
&ldquo;applied to a great man in power,&rdquo; informing him that
he knew Mills, and that if he could be assured of his pardon he
would endeavour to take him, for he was pretty certain to find
him either at Bristol or Bath, whither he knew he was gone, to
sell some run goods.
Being assured of his pardon, he set out accordingly, and found
not only Mills, but two brothers, Lawrence and Thomas Kemp,
themselves smugglers and highway robbers, and wanted for various
offences; Thomas Kemp being additionally in request for having
broken out of Newgate.
The informer, Pring, artfully talking matters <a
name="page66">p. 66over with
these three, and observing that the cases of all of them were
desperate, offered the advice that they should all accompany him
towards London, to his house at Beckenham, where they would
decide upon some plan for taking to highway robbery and
house-breaking, in the same manner as Gregory&rsquo;s Gang <a
name="citation66"><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66] used to do.
This they all heartily agreed to, and confidentially, on the
journey up to Beckenham, spoke and bragged of their various
crimes.
Arrived at Beckenham, Pring made a plausible excuse to leave
them awhile at his house, while he fetched his mare, in exchange
for the very indifferent horse he had ridden.&nbsp; It would
never do, he said, when on their highway business, for one of the
company to be badly horsed.
He left the house and rode hurriedly to Horsham, whence he
returned with eight or nine mounted officers of excise.&nbsp;
They arrived at midnight, and found his three guests sitting down
to supper.
The two Kemps were easily secured, and tied by the arms; but
Mills would not so readily submit, and was slashed with a sword
before he would give in.




John Mills was a son of Richard Mills, and a brother of
Richard Mills the younger, executed at Chichester for the murder
of Chater and Galley, <span
class="pagenum">p. 67as already detailed, and he also had
taken part in that business.&nbsp; Brought to trial at East
Grinstead, he said he had indeed been a very wicked liver, but he
bitterly complained of such of the witnesses against him as had
been smugglers and had turned King&rsquo;s evidence.&nbsp; They
had, he declared, acted contrary from the solemn oaths and
engagements they had made and sworn to among themselves, and he
therefore wished they might all come to the same end, and be
hanged like him and damned afterwards.
He was found guilty and duly sentenced to death, and was
hanged and afterwards hung in chains on a gibbet erected for the
purpose on Slindon Common, near the &ldquo;Dog and
Partridge.&rdquo;
Curtis, an active partner in the same murder, fled the
country, and was said to have enlisted in the Irish Brigade of
the French Army.&nbsp; Robb was not taken, and Reynolds was
acquitted of the murder.&nbsp; He and his wife were tried at the
next Assizes, as accessories after the fact.
The &ldquo;Dog and Partridge&rdquo; has long ceased to be an
inn, but the house survives, a good deal altered, as a
cottage.&nbsp; In the garden may be seen a very capacious cellar,
excavated out of the soil and sandstone, and very much larger
than a small country inn could have ever required for ordinary
business purposes.&nbsp; It is known as the
&ldquo;Smugglers&rsquo; Cellar.&rdquo;
At the same sessions at which these bloodstained scoundrels
were convicted a further body of five men, Lawrence and Thomas
Kemp, John p.
68Brown, Robert Fuller, and Richard Savage, were all tried
on charges of highway robbery, of housebreaking, and of stealing
goods from a wagon.&nbsp; They were all members of the notorious
Hawkhurst Gang, and had been smugglers for many years.&nbsp; All
were found guilty and sentenced to death, except Savage, who was
awarded transportation for life.&nbsp; The rest were executed at
Horsham on April 1st, 1749.&nbsp; One of them had at least once
already come near to being capitally convicted, but had been
rescued from Newgate by a party of fellow-smugglers before
justice could complete her processes.
These rescuers were in their turn arrested on other charges,
and brought to trial at Rochester Assizes, with other
malefactors, in March 1750.&nbsp; They were four notorious
smugglers, Stephen Diprose, James Bartlett, Thomas Potter, and
William Priggs, who were all executed on Penenden Heath, on March
30th.
Bartlett, pressed to declare, after sentence, if he had been
concerned in any murders, particularly in that of Mr. Castle, an
excise officer who had been shot on Selhurst Common by a gang of
smugglers, would not give a positive answer, and it was therefore
supposed he was concerned in it.
Potter described some of the doings of the gang, and told how,
fully armed, they would roam the country districts at night,
disguised, with blackened faces, and appear at lonely houses,
where they would seize and bind the <span
class="pagenum">p. 69people they found, and then proceed
to plunder at their leisure.
In the short interval that in those days was allowed between
sentence and execution Potter was very communicative, and
disclosed a long career of crime; but he declared that murder had
never been committed by him.&nbsp; He had, it was true, proposed
to murder the turnkey at Newgate at the time when he and his
companions rescued their friends languishing in that doleful
hold: but it had not, after all, been found necessary.
This, it will be conceded, was sufficiently frank and
open.&nbsp; The official account of that rescue was that Thomas
Potter and three other smugglers came into the press-yard at
Newgate to visit two prisoners, Thomas Kemp and William Grey,
also of the Hawkhurst Gang, when they agreed at all hazards to
assist in getting them out.&nbsp; Accordingly the time was fixed
(Kemp having no irons, and Grey having his so managed as to be
able to let them fall off when he pleased), and Potter and the
other three went again to the press-yard and rang the bell for
the turnkey to come and let them in.&nbsp; When he came and
unlocked the door Potter immediately knocked him down with a
horse-pistol, and cut him terribly; and Kemp and Grey made their
escape, while Potter and his companions got clear away without
being discovered.&nbsp; Three other prisoners at the same time
broke loose, but were immediately recaptured, having irons
on.
p. 70All
these men were, in fact, originally smugglers, and had, from
being marked down as criminals for that offence, and from being
&ldquo;wanted&rdquo; by the law, found themselves obliged to keep
in hiding from their homes.&nbsp; In default of being able to
take part in other runs of smuggled goods, and finding themselves
unable to get employment, they were driven to other, and more
serious, crimes.
On April 4th of the same year four other members of the
terrible Hawkhurst Gang&mdash;Kingsmill, Fairall, Perrin, and
Glover by name&mdash;were together brought to trial at the Old
Bailey, charged with being concerned in the Poole affair, the
breaking open of the custom-house, and the stealing of goods
therefrom.&nbsp; They had been betrayed to the Government by the
same two ex-smugglers who had turned King&rsquo;s evidence at the
Chichester trial, and their evidence again secured a
conviction.&nbsp; Glover, recommended by the jury to the royal
mercy, was eventually pardoned; but the remaining three were
hanged.&nbsp; Fairall behaved most insolently at the trial, and
even threatened one of the witnesses.&nbsp; Glover displayed
penitence; and Kingsmill and Perrin insisted that they had not
been guilty of any robbery, because the goods they had taken were
their own.
Kingsmill had been leader in the ferocious attack on Goudhurst
in April 1747, and was an extremely dangerous ruffian, ready for
any extremity.
p. 71Fairall
was proved to be a particularly desperate fellow.&nbsp; Two years
earlier he had been apprehended, as a smuggler, in Sussex, and,
being brought before Mr. Butler, a magistrate, at Lewes, was
remitted by him for trial in London.
Brought under escort overnight to the New Prison in the
Borough, Fairall found means to make a dash from the custody of
his guards, and, leaping upon a horse that was standing in
Blackman Street, rode away and escaped, within sight of numerous
people.
Returning to the gang, who were reasonably surprised at his
safe return from the jaws of death, he was filled with an
unreasoning hatred of Mr. Butler, the justice who, in the
ordinary course of his duty, had committed him.&nbsp; He proposed
a complete and terrible revenge: firstly, by destroying all the
deer in his park, and all his trees, which was readily agreed to
by the gang; and then, since those measures were not extreme
enough for them, the idea was discussed of setting fire to his
house and burning him alive in it.&nbsp; Some of the
conspirators, however, thought this too extreme a step, and they
parted without coming to any decision.&nbsp; Fairall, Kingsmill,
and others, however, determined not to be baulked, then each
procured a brace of pistols, and waited for the magistrate, near
his own park wall, to shoot him when he returned home that night
from a journey to Horsham.
Fortunately for him, some accident kept him from returning,
and the party of would-be <span
class="pagenum">p. 72assassins, tired of waiting, at last
said to one another, &ldquo;Damn him, he will not come home
to-night!&nbsp; Let us be gone about our business.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They then dispersed, swearing they would watch for a month
together, but they would have him; and that they would make an
example of all who should dare to obstruct them.
Perrin&rsquo;s body was directed to be given to his friends,
instead of being hanged in chains, and he was pitying the
misfortunes of his two companions, who were not only, like
himself, to be hanged, but whose bodies were afterwards to be
gibbeted, when Fairall said, &ldquo;We shall be hanging up
in the sweet air when you are rotting in your
grave.&rdquo;
Fairall kept a bold front to the very last.&nbsp; The night
before the execution, he smoked continually with his friends,
until ordered by the warder to go to his cell; when he exclaimed,
&ldquo;Why in such a hurry?&nbsp; Cannot you let me stay a little
longer with my friends?&nbsp; I shall not be able to drink with
them to-morrow night.&rdquo;
But perhaps there was more self-pity in those apparently
careless words and in that indifferent demeanour than those
thought who heard them.
Kingsmill was but twenty-eight years of age, and Fairall
twenty-five, at the time of their execution, which took place at
Tyburn on April 26th, 1749.&nbsp; Fairall&rsquo;s body was hanged
in chains on Horsenden Green, and that of Kingsmill on Goudhurst
Gore, appropriately near the frighted village whose inhabitants
he had p.
73promised the vengeance of himself and his reckless
band.
When G. P. R. James wrote his romance, &ldquo;The
Smuggler,&rdquo; about the middle of the nineteenth century,
reminiscences of the smuggling age were yet fresh, and many an
one who had passed his youth and middle age in the art was still
in a hale and hearty eld, ready to tell wonderful stories of
bygone years.&nbsp; James therefore heard at first hand all the
ins and outs of this shy business; and although his story deals
with the exploits of the Ransley Gang (whom he styles
&ldquo;Ramley&rdquo;) of a much earlier period, the circumstances
of smuggling, and the conditions prevailing in Kent and Sussex,
remained much the same in the experiences of the elderly
ex-smugglers he met.&nbsp; What he has to say is therefore of
more than common value.
Scarcely any one of the maritime counties, he tells us, was
without its gang of smugglers; for if France was not opposite,
Holland was not far off; and if brandy was not the object, nor
silk, nor wine, yet tea and cinnamon, and hollands, and various
East India goods, were duly estimated by the British public,
especially when they could be obtained without the payment of
custom-house dues.
As there are land-sharks and water-sharks, so there were
land-smugglers and water-smugglers.&nbsp; The latter brought the
objects of their commerce either from foreign countries or from
foreign vessels, and landed them on the coast&mdash;and a <a
name="page74">p. 74bold, daring,
reckless body of men they were; the former, in gangs, consisting
frequently of many hundreds, generally well-mounted and armed,
conveyed the commodities so landed into the interior and
distributed them to others, who retailed them as occasion
required.&nbsp; Nor were these gentry one whit less fearless,
enterprising, and lawless than their brethren of the sea.
The ramifications of this vast and magnificent league extended
themselves to almost every class of society.&nbsp; Each tradesman
smuggled, or dealt in smuggled goods; each public-house was
supported by smugglers, and gave them in return every facility
possible; each country gentleman on the coast dabbled a little in
the interesting traffic; almost every magistrate shared in the
proceeds, or partook of the commodities.&nbsp; Scarcely a house
but had its place of concealment, which would accommodate either
kegs or bales, or human beings, as the case might be; and many
streets in seaport towns had private passages from one house to
another, so that the gentleman inquired for by the officers at
No. 1 was often walking quietly out of No. 20, while they were
searching for him in vain.&nbsp; The back of one street had
always excellent means of communication with the front of
another, and the gardens gave exit to the country with as little
delay as possible.
Of all counties, however, the most favoured by nature and art
for the very pleasant and exciting sport of smuggling was the
county of p.
75Kent.&nbsp; Its geographical position, its local
features, its variety of coast, all afforded it the greatest
advantages, and the daring character of the natives on the shores
of the Channel was sure to turn those advantages to the purposes
in question.&nbsp; Sussex, indeed, was not without its share of
facilities, nor did the Sussex men fail to improve them; but they
were so much farther off from the opposite coast that the chief
commerce&mdash;the regular trade&mdash;was not in any degree at
Hastings, Rye, or Winchelsea to be compared with that carried on
from the North Foreland to Romney Hoy.&nbsp; At one time the fine
level of the Marsh, a dark night, and a fair wind, afforded a
delightful opportunity for landing a cargo and carrying it
rapidly into the interior; at another, Sandwich Flats and
Pevensey Bay presented harbours of refuge and places of repose
for kegs innumerable and bales of great value; at another, the
cliffs round Folkestone and near the South Foreland saw spirits
travelling up by paths which seemed inaccessible to mortal foot;
and at another, the wild and broken ground at the back of
Sandgate was traversed by long trains of horses, escorting or
carrying every description of contraband articles.
The interior of the county was not less favourable to the
traffic than the coast: large masses of wood, numerous
gentlemen&rsquo;s parks, hills and dales tossed about in wild
confusion; roads such as nothing but horses could travel, or men
on foot, often constructed with felled <span
class="pagenum">p. 76trees or broad stones laid side by
side; wide tracts of ground, partly copse and partly moor, called
in that county &ldquo;minnises,&rdquo; and a long extent of the
Weald of Kent, through which no highway existed, and where such a
thing as coach or carriage was never seen, offered the
land-smugglers opportunities of carrying on their transactions
with a degree of secrecy and safety no other county
afforded.&nbsp; Their numbers, too, were so great, their boldness
and violence so notorious, their powers of injuring or annoying
so various, that even those who took no part in their operations
were glad to connive at their proceedings, and at times to aid in
concealing their persons or their goods.&nbsp; Not a park, not a
wood, not a barn, that did not at some period afford them a
refuge when pursued, or become a depository for their
commodities, and many a man, on visiting his stables or his
cart-shed early in the morning, found it tenanted by anything but
horses or wagons.&nbsp; The churchyards were frequently crowded
at night by other spirits than those of the dead, and not even
the church was exempted from such visitations.
None of the people of the county took notice of, or opposed
these proceedings.&nbsp; The peasantry laughed at, or aided, and
very often got a good day&rsquo;s work, or, at all events, a jug
of genuine hollands, from the friendly smugglers; the clerk and
the sexton willingly aided and abetted, and opened the door of
vault, or vestry, or church for the reception of the passing
goods; the clergyman <span
class="pagenum">p. 77shut his eyes if he saw tubs or jars
in his way; and it is remarkable what good brandy-punch was
generally to be found at the house of the village pastor.&nbsp;
The magistrates of the county, when called upon to aid in pursuit
of the smugglers, looked grave and swore in constables very
slowly, dispatched servants on horseback to see what was going
on, and ordered the steward or the butler to &ldquo;send the
sheep to the wood&rdquo;: an intimation not lost upon those for
whom it was intended.&nbsp; The magistrates and officers of
seaport towns were in general so deeply implicated in the trade
themselves that smuggling had a fairer chance than the law, in
any case that came before them; and never was a more hopeless
enterprise undertaken, in ordinary circumstances, than that of
convicting a smuggler, unless captured in flagrante
delicto.

Hastings&mdash;The Incident of
&ldquo;The Four Brothers&rdquo;
Sussex was again the scene of a
barbarous incident, in 1768; and on this occasion seafaring men
were the malefactors.
It is still an article of faith with the writers of
guide-books who do not make their own inquiries, and thus
perpetuate obsolete things, that to call a Hastings fisherman a
&ldquo;Chop-back&rdquo; will rouse him to fury.&nbsp; But when a
modern visitor, primed with such romance as this, timidly
approaches one of these broad-shouldered and amply-paunched
fisherfolk and suggests &ldquo;Chop-backs&rdquo; as a subject of
inquiry, I give you my word they only look upon you with a
puzzled expression, and don&rsquo;t understand in the least your
meaning.
But in an earlier generation this was a term of great offence
to the Hastingers.&nbsp; It arose, according to tradition, from
the supposed descent <span
class="pagenum">p. 79of these fisherfolk from the Norse
rovers who used the axe, and cleaved their enemies with them from
skull to chine.&nbsp; But the true facts of the case are laid to
the account of some of the notorious Ruxley Gang, who in 1768
boarded a Dutch hoy, the Three Sisters, in mid-channel, on
pretence of trading, and chopped the master, Peter Bootes, down
the back with a hatchet.&nbsp; This horrid deed might never have
come to light had not these ruffians betrayed themselves by
bragging to one another of their cleverness, and dwelling upon
the way in which the Dutchman wriggled when they had slashed him
on the backbone.




The Government in November of that year sent a detachment of
two hundred Inniskilling Dragoons to Hastings, to arrest the men
implicated, and a man-o&rsquo;-war and cutter lay off shore to
receive them when they had been taken prisoners.&nbsp; The
soldiers had strict orders to keep their mission secret, but the
day after their arrival they were called out to arrest rioters
who had violently assaulted the Mayor, whom they suspected of
laying information against the murderers.&nbsp; The secret of the
reason for the soldiers&rsquo; coming had evidently in some
manner leaked out.&nbsp; Several arrests of rioters were made,
and the men implicated in the outrage on the Dutch boat were duly
taken into custody.
The whole affair was so closely interwoven with smuggling that
it was by many suspected that the men who had been seized were
held for that offence as well; and persons in the higher <a
name="page80">p. 80walks of the
smuggling business, namely, those who financed it, and those
others who largely purchased the goods, grew seriously alarmed
for their own liberty.&nbsp; In the panic that thus laid hold of
the town a well-to-do shopkeeper absconded altogether.
Thirteen men were indicted in the Admiralty Court on October
30th, 1769, for piracy and murder on the high seas; namely,
Thomas Phillips, elder and younger, William and George Phillips,
Mark Chatfield, Robert Webb, Thomas and Samuel Ailsbury, James
and Richard Hyde, William Geary, alias Justice,
alias George Wood, Thomas Knight, and William Wenham, and
were capitally convicted.&nbsp; Of these, four, Thomas Ailsbury,
William Geary, William Wenham, and Richard Hyde, were hanged at
Execution Dock, November 27th.
The next most outstanding incident, a bloody affray which
occurred on February 26th, 1780, belongs to Kent.
As Mr. Joseph Nicholson, supervisor of excise, was removing to
Canterbury a large seizure of geneva he had made at Whitstable, a
numerous body of smugglers followed him and his escort of a
corporal and eight troopers of the 4th Dragoons.&nbsp; Fifty of
the smugglers had firearms, and, coming up with the escort,
opened fire without warning or demanding their goods.&nbsp; Two
Dragoons were killed on the spot, and two others dangerously
wounded.&nbsp; The smugglers then loaded up the goods and
disappeared.&nbsp; A reward of &pound;100 was at <a
name="page81">p. 81once offered
by the Commissioners of Excise, with a pardon, for informers; and
Lieutenant-Colonel Hugonin, of the 4th Dragoons, offered another
&pound;50.&nbsp; John Knight, of Whitstable, was shortly
afterwards arrested, on information received, and was tried and
convicted at Maidstone Assizes.&nbsp; He was hanged on Penenden
Heath and his body afterwards gibbeted on Borstal Hill, the spot
where the attack had been made.
The south held unquestioned pre-eminence, as long as smuggling
activities lasted, and the records of bloodshed and hard-fought
encounters are fullest along the coasts of Kent and Sussex.&nbsp;
Sometimes, but not often, they are varied by a touch of
humour.
The convenience afforded by churches for the storing of
smuggled goods is a commonplace of the history of smuggling; and
there is scarce a seaboard church of which some like tale is not
told, while not a few inland church-towers and churchyards enjoy
the same reputation.&nbsp; Asked to account for this almost
universal choice of a hiding-place by the smugglers, a parish
clerk of that age supposed, truly enough, that it was because no
one was ever likely to go near a church, except on Sundays.&nbsp;
This casts an instructive side-light upon the Church of England
and religion at any time from two hundred to seventy or eighty
years ago.
But a tale of more than common humour was told of the old
church at Hove, near Brighton, many years ago.&nbsp; It seems
that this ancient p.
82building had been greatly injured by fire in the middle
of the seventeenth century, but that the population was so small
and so little disposed to increase that a mere patching up of the
ruins was sufficient for local needs.&nbsp; Moreover, the
spiritual needs of the place were considered to be so small that
Hove and Preston parishes were ecclesiastically united, and were
served by one clergyman, who conducted service at each parish
church on alternate Sundays.&nbsp; At a later period, indeed,
Hove church was used only once in six weeks.
But in the alternate Sunday period the smugglers of this then
lonely shore found the half-ruined church of Hove peculiarly
useful for their trade; hence the following story.
One &ldquo;Hove Sunday&rdquo; the vicar, duly robed, appeared
here to take the duty, and found, greatly to his surprise, that
no bell was ringing to call the faithful to worship.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why is the bell not ringing?&rdquo; demanded the
vicar.
&ldquo;Preston Sunday, sir,&rdquo; returned the sexton
shortly.
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied the vicar.
&ldquo;Indeed, then, sir, &rsquo;tis.&rdquo;
But the vicar was not to be argued out of his own plain
conviction that he had taken Preston last Sunday, and desired the
sexton to start the bell-ringing at once.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Taint no good, then, sir,&rdquo; said the
sexton, beaten back into his last ditch of defence; &ldquo;you
can&rsquo;t preach to-day.&rdquo;




p.
83&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t, fellow?&rdquo; angrily
responded the vicar; &ldquo;what do you mean by
&lsquo;can&rsquo;t&rsquo;?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, then, sir,&rdquo; said the sexton, &ldquo;if you
must know, the church is full of tubs, and the pulpit&rsquo;s
full of tea.&rdquo;
An especially impudent smuggling incident was reported from
Hove on Sunday, October 16th, 1819, in the following words:
&ldquo;A suspected smuggling boat being seen off Hove by some
of the custom-house officers, they, with two of the crew of the
Hound revenue cutter, gave chase in a galley.&nbsp; On
coming up with the boat their suspicions were confirmed, and they
at once boarded her; but while intent on securing their prize,
nine of the smugglers leapt into the Hound&rsquo;s galley
and escaped.&nbsp; Landing at Hove, seven of them got away at
once, two being taken prisoners by some officers who were waiting
for them.&nbsp; Upon this a large company of smugglers assembled,
at once commenced a desperate attack upon the officers, and,
having overpowered them, assaulted them with stones and large
sticks, knocked them down, and cut the belts of the chief
officer&rsquo;s arms, which they took away, and thereby enabled
the two prisoners to escape.&rdquo;
A reward of &pound;200 was offered, but without result.&nbsp;
The cargo of the smugglers consisted of 225 tubs of gin, 52 tubs
of brandy, and one bag of tobacco.
Many of the ghost-stories of a hundred years and more ago
originated in the smugglers&rsquo; <span
class="pagenum">p. 84midnight escapades.&nbsp; It was, of
course, entirely to their advantage that superstitious people who
heard unaccountable sounds and saw indescribable sights should go
off with the notion that supernatural beings were about, and
resolve thenceforward to go those haunted ways no more.&nbsp; The
mysterious &ldquo;ghostly drummer&rdquo; of Herstmonceux, who was
often heard and seen by terrified rustics whose way led them past
the ruined castle at night, was a confederate of the Hastings and
Eastbourne smugglers, to whom those roofless walls and the hoary
tombs of the adjoining churchyard were valuable
storehouses.&nbsp; Rubbed with a little phosphorus, and parading
those spots once in a way with his drum, they soon became
shunned.&nbsp; The tombstones in Herstmonceux churchyard, mostly
of the kind known as &ldquo;altar-tombs,&rdquo; had slabs which
the smugglers easily made to turn on swivels; and from them
issued at times spirits indeed, but not such as would frighten
many men.&nbsp; The haunted character of Herstmonceux ceased with
the establishment of the coastguard in 1831, and the drummer was
heard to drum no more.
The churchyards of the Sussex coast and its neighbourhood
still bear witness to the fatal affrays between excisemen and
smugglers that marked those times; and even far inland may be
found epitaphs on those who fell, breathing curses and Divine
vengeance on the persons who brought them to an untimely
end.&nbsp; Thus at Tandridge, Surrey, near Godstone, may be seen
a tall p.
85tombstone beside the south porch of the church, to one
Thomas Todman, aged thirty-one years, who was shot dead in a
smuggling affray in 1781.&nbsp; Here follow the lamentable
verses, oddities of grammar, spelling, and punctuation duly
preserved:
Thou Shall do no Murder, nor Shalt thou Steal<br
/>
are the Commands Jehovah did Reveal
but thou O Wretch, Without fear or dread
of Thy Tremendous Maker Shot me dead
Amidst my strength my sins forgive
As I through Boundless Mercy
hope to live.

The prudery of some conscientious objector to the word
&ldquo;wretch&rdquo; has caused it to be almost obliterated.




At Patcham, near Brighton, the weatherworn epitaph on the
north side of the church to Daniel Scales may still with
difficulty be deciphered:
Sacred to the memory of
Daniel Scales
who was unfortunately shot on Thursday evening,
November 7th 1796
Alas! swift flew the fatal lead,
Which pierc&egrave;d through the young man&rsquo;s head
He instant fell, resigned his breath,
And closed his languid eyes in death.
All you who do this stone draw near,
Oh! pray let fall the pitying tear.
From this sad instance may we all,
Prepare to meet Jehovah&rsquo;s call.

Daniel Scales was one of a desperate smuggling gang, who had
had many narrow escapes, but was at last shot through the
head.
p. 86Again,
at Westfield, Sussex, not far from Rye, may be found an old
stone, rapidly going to decay, bearing some lines to the memory
of a smuggler named Moon:
&ldquo;In Memory of John Moon, who was deprived of
life by a base man, on the 20th of June 1809, in the 28th year of
his age.
&rsquo;Tis mine to-day to moulder
in the earth. . . .&rdquo;

The rest is not now readable.
Among the many tragical incidents of the smuggling era was the
affray aboard a fishing-smack off Hastings in March 1821, in
which a fisherman named Joseph Swain, supposed by the blockading
officers of the preventive force to be a smuggler, was
killed.&nbsp; Fishing-boats and their crews were, as a matter of
course, searched by these officials; but the boat boarded by them
on this occasion belonged to Swain, who denied having any
contraband goods aboard and refused to permit the search.&nbsp;
So strenuous a refusal as Swain offered would seem, in those
times, of itself sufficient evidence of the presence of smuggled
articles, and the boarders persisted.&nbsp; A sailor among them,
George England by name, pressed forward to the attack, and Swain
seized his cutlass and tore it out of his hand; whereupon England
drew a pistol and fired at Swain, who instantly fell dead.
An epitaph in the churchyard of All Saints, Hastings, bears
witness to this incident:




<a
name="page87">p. 87This Stone<br
/>
Sacred to the memory of
Joseph Swain, Fisherman
was erected at the expence of
the members of the friendly
Society of Hastings
in commiseration of his cruel and
untimely death and as a record of
the public indignation at the need-
lefs and sanguinary violence of
which he was the unoffending Victim
He was shot by Geo. England, one
of the Sailors employ&rsquo;d in the Coast
blockade service in open day on the
13th March 1821 and almost instantly
expir&rsquo;d, in the twenty ninth Year of
his age, leaving a Widow and five
small children to lament his lofs.

England was subsequently put on his trial for wilful murder at
Horsham, and was sentenced to death, but afterwards pardoned.
In short, in one way and another, much good blood and a great
quantity of the most excellent spirits were spilt and let run to
waste, along the coasts.
The affair of the Badger revenue cutter and the Vre
Brodiers, or Four Brothers, smuggling lugger was the
next exciting event.&nbsp; It happened on January 13th, 1823, and
attracted a great deal of attention at the time, not only on
account of the severe encounter at sea, but from the subsequent
trial of the crew of the smuggler.&nbsp; The Four Brothers
was a Folkestone boat, and her crew of twenty-six were chiefly
Folkestone men.&nbsp; She was a considerable vessel, having once
been a p.
88French privateer, and was, as a privateer had need to
be, a smart, easily handled craft, capable of giving the go-by to
most other vessels.&nbsp; She carried four six-pound
carronades.&nbsp; In constant commission, her crew pouched a
pound a week wages, with an additional ten guineas for each
successful run.
On January 12th, of this momentous voyage, she sailed from
Flushing with over one hundred tons of leaf-tobacco aboard,
snugly packed for convenience of carriage in bales of 60 lb., and
carried also a small consignment of brandy and gin, contained in
50 half-ankers, and 13 chests of tea&mdash;all destined for the
south of Ireland.&nbsp; Ship and cargo were worth some
&pound;11,000; so it is sufficiently evident that her owners were
in a considerable way of business of the contraband kind.
At daybreak on the morning of January 13th, when off Dieppe
and sailing very slowly, in a light wind, the crew of the Four
Brothers found themselves almost upon what they at first took
to be French fishing-boats, and held unsuspiciously on her
course.&nbsp; Suddenly, however, one of them ran a flag smartly
up her halliards and fired a gun across the bows of the Four
Brothers, as a signal to bring her to.&nbsp; It was the
revenue cutter Badger.
Unfortunately for the smuggler, she was carrying a newly
stepped mainmast, and under small sail only, and accordingly, in
disobeying the summons and attempting to get away, she was
speedily outsailed.
p. 89The
smuggler, unable to get away, hoisted the Dutch colours and
opened the fight that took place by firing upon the
Badger, which immediately returned it.&nbsp; For two hours
this exchange of shots was maintained.&nbsp; Early in the
encounter William Cullum, seaman, was killed aboard the
Badger, and Lieutenant Nazer, in command, received a shot
from a musket in the left shoulder.&nbsp; One man of the Four
Brothers was killed outright, and nine wounded, but the fight
would have continued had not the Badger sailed into the
starboard quarter of the smuggler, driving her bowsprit clean
through her adversary&rsquo;s mainsail.&nbsp; Even then the
smuggler&rsquo;s crew endeavoured to fire one of her guns, but
failed.
The commander of the Badger thereupon called upon the
Four Brothers to surrender; or, according to his own
version, the smugglers themselves called for quarter; and the
mate and some of the cutter&rsquo;s men went in a boat and
received their submission, and sent them prisoners aboard the
Badger.&nbsp; The smugglers claimed that they had
surrendered only on condition that they should have their boats
and personal belongings and be allowed to go ashore; but it seems
scarce likely the Lieutenant could have promised so much.&nbsp;
The Four Brothers was then taken into Dover Harbour and
her crew sent aboard the Severn man-o&rsquo;-war and kept
in irons in the cockpit.&nbsp; Three of her wounded died
there.&nbsp; The others, after a short interval, were again put
aboard the Badger and taken up the Thames to <a
name="page90">p. 90imprisonment
on the Tower tender for a further three or four days.&nbsp;
Thence they were removed, all handcuffed and chained, in a barge
and committed to the King&rsquo;s Bench Prison.&nbsp; At Bow
Street, on the following day, they were all formally committed
for trial, and then remitted to the King&rsquo;s Bench Prison for
eleven weeks, before the case came on.
On Friday, April 25th, 1823, the twenty-two prisoners were
arraigned in the High Court of Admiralty; Marinel Krans, master
of the Four Brothers, and his crew, nearly all of whom
bore Dutch names, being charged with wilfully and feloniously
firing on the revenue cutter Badger, on January 13th,
1823, on the high seas, about eight miles off Dungeness, within
the jurisdiction of the High Court of Admiralty of England.
Mr. Brougham, afterwards Lord Brougham, defended, the defence
being that the Four Brothers was a Dutch vessel, owned at
Flushing, and her crew Dutchmen.&nbsp; A great deal of very hard
swearing went towards this ingenious defence, for the crew, it is
hardly necessary to say, were almost all English.&nbsp; At least
one witness for the prosecution was afraid to appear in
consequence of threats made by prisoners&rsquo; friends, and an
affidavit was put in to that effect.&nbsp; It appeared, in the
evidence given by the commander of the Badger and other
witnesses for the prosecution, that the prisoners all spoke
excellent English at the time of the capture, and afterwards; but
they, singularly enough, understood little or none <a
name="page91">p. 91when in
court, and had to be communicated with through the agency of an
interpreter.
In summing up, Mr. Justice Parke said the crime for which the
prisoners were tried was not murder, but was a capital
offence.&nbsp; Two things, if found by the jury, would suffice to
acquit the prisoners.&nbsp; The first was that no part of the
vessel which they navigated belonged to any subject of His
Majesty; the other that one half of the crew were not His
Majesty&rsquo;s subjects.&nbsp; For if neither of these facts
existed, His Majesty&rsquo;s ship had no right to fire at their
vessel.&nbsp; But if the jury believed that any part of the
vessel was British property, or that one half of her crew were
British subjects, then His Majesty&rsquo;s ship Badger,
under the circumstances that had been proved, being on her duty,
and having her proper colours flying, was justified in boarding
their vessel; and their making resistance by firing at the
Badger was a capital offence.&nbsp; The reason for the
evidence respecting the distance of the vessels from the French
coast being given was that, by the law of nations, ships of war
were not, in time of peace, permitted to molest any vessel within
one league of the coast of any other power.
The jury, after deliberating for two hours, returned a verdict
of &ldquo;Not Guilty&rdquo; for all the prisoners, finding that
the ship and cargo were wholly foreign property, and that more
than one half the crew were foreigners.&nbsp; They were,
accordingly, at once liberated, and returned to <a
name="page92">p. 92Folkestone in
midst of great popular rejoicings.&nbsp; The Four Brothers
was also released, and the commander of the Badger had the
mortification of being obliged to escort her out of Dover
harbour.
Dover town was, about this time, the scene of stirring
events.&nbsp; One Lieutenant Lilburn, in command of a revenue
cutter, had captured a smuggler, and had placed the crew in Dover
gaol.&nbsp; As they had not offered armed resistance to the
capture, their offence was not capital, but they were liable to
service on board a man-o&rsquo;-war&mdash;a fate they were most
anxious to avoid.&nbsp; These imprisoned men were largely natives
of Folkestone and Sandgate, and their relatives determined to
march over the ten miles between those places and Dover, and, if
possible, liberate them.&nbsp; When they arrived in Dover, and
their intention became known, a crowd of fisherfolk and longshore
people swarmed out of the Dover alley-ways and reinforced
them.&nbsp; Prominent among them were the women, who, as ever in
cases of popular tumult, proved themselves the most violent and
destructive among the mob.&nbsp; Nothing less than the
destruction of the gaol was decided upon, and the more active
spirits, leaving others to batter in the walls, doors, and
windows, climbed upon the roof, and from that vantage-point
showered bricks and tiles upon the Mayor and the soldiers who had
been called out.&nbsp; The Mayor, beset with tooth and claw by
screeching women, who tore the Riot Act out of his hand, fled,
and Lieutenant Lilburn exhorted the officer <a
name="page93">p. 93in charge of
the military to fire upon the crowd, but he declined; and
meanwhile the tradespeople and respectable inhabitants busied
themselves in barricading their shops and houses.




The prisoners were triumphantly liberated, taken to a
blacksmith&rsquo;s, where their irons were knocked off, and then
driven off in post chaises to Folkestone, whence they dispersed
to their several hiding-places.
Romney was, about this time, the scene of another desperate
affair, when an attempted seizure of contraband brought all the
smugglers&rsquo; friends and relations out, in violent contest
with the excise and a small party of marines in command of which
was one Lieutenant Peat.&nbsp; A magistrate was sent for, who,
amid a shower of stones, read the Riot Act.&nbsp; The Lieutenant
hesitated to resort to extreme force, but one of the smugglers
was eventually killed by him, in response to the
magistrate&rsquo;s order, in respect of one of the most violent
of the crowd: Secure your prisoner, sir.&nbsp; Run the rascal
through!

The &rsquo;twenties of the
nineteenth century formed a period especially rich in smuggling
incidents, or perhaps seem so to do, because, with the growth of
country newspapers, they were more fully reported, instead of
being left merely the subject of local legend.
A desperate affray took place in Rye Harbour so late as May
1826, when a ten-oared smuggling galley, chased by a revenue
guard-boat, ran ashore.&nbsp; The smugglers, abandoning their
oars, opened fire upon the guard, but the blockade-men from the
watch-house at Camber then arrived upon the scene and seized one
of the smugglers; whereupon a gang of not fewer than two hundred
armed smugglers, who had until that moment been acting as a
concealed reserve, rushed violently from behind the sandhills,
and commenced firing on the blockade-men, killing <a
name="page95">p. 95one and
wounding another.&nbsp; They were, however, ultimately driven
off, with the capture of their galley, but managed to carry off
their wounded.
On another occasion, four or five smugglers were drowned
whilst swimming the Military Canal, with tubs slung on their
backs, at a point on Pett Level called &ldquo;Pett
Horse-race.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had, in the dark, missed the spot
where it was fordable.&nbsp; Romney Marsh, and the wide-spreading
levels of Pett, Camber, Guilford, and Dunge Marsh had&mdash;as we
have already seen, in the account of the owlers given in earlier
pages&mdash;ever been the smugglers&rsquo; Alsatia.
The Rev. Richard Harris Barham, author of the &ldquo;Ingoldsby
Legends,&rdquo; has placed upon record some of his meetings with
smugglers in &ldquo;this recondite region,&rdquo; as he was
pleased to style it; and his son, in the life he wrote of his
father, adds to them.&nbsp; Barham, ordained in 1813, and given
the curacy of Westwell, near Ashford, had not long to wait before
being brought into touch with the lawless doings here.&nbsp; One
of the desperate smugglers of the Marsh had been shot through the
body in an encounter with the riding-officers, and fatally
wounded.&nbsp; As he lay dying, Barham was brought to convey to
him the last consolations of religion, and was startled when the
smuggler declared there was no crime of which he had not been
guilty.
&ldquo;Murder is not to be reckoned among them, I hope,&rdquo;
exclaimed the not easily shocked clergyman.
p.
96&ldquo;Too many of them!&rdquo; was the startling
response of the dying man.
In 1817 Barham was collated by the Archbishop of Canterbury to
the adjoining livings of Warehorne and Snargate, the first-named
situated on the verge of the marsh; the second situated, moist
and forbidding, in the marsh itself.&nbsp; The winding road
between these two villages crossed the then newly made Royal
Military Canal by a bridge.&nbsp; Often, as the clergyman was
returning, late at night, to his comfortable parsonage at
Warehorne, he was met and stopped by some mysterious horsemen;
but when he mentioned his name he was invariably allowed to
proceed, and, as he did so, a long and silent company of mounted
smugglers defiled past, each man with his led horse laden with
tubs.&nbsp; The grey tower of Snargate church he frequently
found, by the aroma of tobacco it often exhaled, instead of its
customary and natural mustiness, to have been recently used as a
store for smuggled bales of that highly taxed article.
The Cinque Ports Herald of 1826 records the landing on
a night in May, or in the early hours of the morning, of a
considerable cargo of contraband hereabouts:
&ldquo;A large party of smugglers had assembled in
the neighbourhood of Dymchurch, and a boat laden (as is supposed)
with tubs of spirits, being observed to approach the shore nearly
opposite to Dymchurch, the smugglers instantly commenced
cheering, and rushed upon the coast, <span
class="pagenum">p. 97threatening defiance to the sentinels
of the blockade; who, perceiving such an overwhelming force, gave
the alarm, when a party of marines, coming to their assistance, a
general firing took place.&nbsp; The smugglers retreated into the
marshes, followed by the blockade-men, and, from their knowledge
of the ground, were indebted for their ultimate escape.&nbsp; We
regret to state two of the blockade seamen were wounded; one
severely in the arm, which must cause amputation, and the other
in the face, by slug shots.&nbsp; There can be no doubt but that
some of the smugglers must have been wounded, if not
killed.&nbsp; One of their muskets was picked up
loaded&mdash;abandoned, no doubt, by the bearer of it, on account
of wounds.&nbsp; The boat, with her cargo, was obliged to put to
sea again, without effecting a landing, and, notwithstanding the
vigilance of Lieutenants Westbrook, Mudge, and McLeod, who were
afloat in their galleys on the spot, from the darkness of the
night, effected its escape.&nbsp; We have also heard that a run
of five hundred tubs took place on the Sussex coast last week,
not far from Hastings, the smugglers losing only eleven
tubs.&nbsp; This was also effected by force, and with such a
superiority in number that they completely overpowered the
blockade force.&rdquo;





The Brighton Gazette, of a few days later, contained
the following:
&ldquo;We have been favoured with some particulars
of another recent attempt to work contraband goods a few miles
eastward of Eastbourne, <span
class="pagenum">p. 98when it appears the coast blockade
succeeded in taking a large boat and upwards of two hundred
tubs.&nbsp; We are sorry to add much mischief has occurred, as on
the following morning blood was observed near the spot.&nbsp; Two
men, it is said, belonging to the boat are taken prisoners, and
two of the blockade are reported to be much bruised and beaten,
and it is also suspected some of the smugglers are seriously, if
not mortally, wounded.&nbsp; The blockade in this instance
behaved in the most humane manner, having received a regular
volley from their opponents before their officers gave directions
for them to fire.&nbsp; We have just heard that five smugglers
were killed in the affray.&rdquo;

On a Sunday night towards the end of July 1826, during a run
of smuggled goods at Dover, the smugglers shot dead a seaman of
the preventive force named Morgan, for which no one was ever
convicted.
A determined and blood-stained struggle took place at Bo-Peep
at midnight of January 3rd, 1828.&nbsp; Bo-Peep was the name of a
desolate spot situated midway between Hastings and Bexhill.&nbsp;
The place is the same as that westernmost extension of St.
Leonards now known by the eminently respectable&mdash;not to say
imposing&mdash;name of &ldquo;West Marina&rdquo;; but in those
times it was a shore, not indeed lonely (better for its
reputation had it been so) but marked by an evil-looking inn, to
which were attached still more evil-looking &ldquo;Pleasure
Gardens.&rdquo;&nbsp; If throats were not, in fact, <a
name="page99">p. 99commonly cut
in those times at Bo-Beep, the inn and its deplorable
&ldquo;Pleasure Gardens&rdquo; certainly looked no fit, or safe,
resort for any innocent young man with a pocketful of money
jingling as he walked.




On this occasion a lugger came in view off shore, when a party
of smugglers armed, as usual, with &ldquo;bats,&rdquo;
i.e. stout ash-poles, some six feet in length, rushed to
the beach, landed the cargo, and made off with it, by various
means, inland a distance of some three miles to Sidley
Green.&nbsp; Here the coast blockade-men, some forty in number,
came up with them.
The smugglers drew up in regular line-formation, and a
desperate fight resulted.&nbsp; The smugglers fought with such
determination and courage that the blockade-men were repulsed and
one, Quartermaster Collins, killed.&nbsp; In the first volley
fired by the blockade an old smuggler named Smithurst was killed;
his body was found next morning, with his &ldquo;bat&rdquo; still
grasped in his hands, the stout staff almost hacked to pieces by
the cutlasses and bayonets of the blockade-men.
At the Spring Assizes held at Horsham, Spencer Whiteman, of
Udimore, Thomas Miller, Henry Miller, John Spray, Edward
Shoesmith, William Bennett, John Ford, and Stephen Stubberfield
were indicted for assembling, armed, for purposes of smuggling,
and were removed for trial to the Old Bailey, where, on April
10th, they all pleaded guilty; as did Whiteman, Thomas Miller,
Spray, Bennett, and Ford, together with <a
name="page100">p. 100Thomas
Maynard and William Plumb, for a like offence on January 23rd,
1828, at Eastbourne.&nbsp; Sentence of death was passed on all,
but was commuted to transportation.&nbsp; With three exceptions,
they were young men, under thirty years of age.
Again, in broad daylight, in 1828, a lugger landed a heavy
cargo of kegs on the open beach at Bo-Peep.&nbsp; No fewer than
three hundred rustic labourers, who had been hired by the job, in
the usual course, by the smugglers bold, assembled on the beach,
and formed up two lines of guards while the landing of the tubs,
and their loading into carts, on horses, or on men&rsquo;s
shoulders, was proceeding.&nbsp; If the preventive officers knew
anything of what was toward that busy day they did not, at any
rate, interfere; and small blame to them for the very elementary
discretion they displayed.&nbsp; They had, as already shown, been
too seriously mauled at an earlier date for them to push matters
again to extremity.
On January 3rd, 1831, in Fairlight Glen, two miles east of
Hastings, two smugglers, William Cruttenden and Joseph Harrod,
were shot dead, and on February 22nd, 1832, at Worthing, when
between two and three hundred smugglers had assembled on the
beach, William Cowardson was shot dead, and several others were
carried away wounded.
Still the tale was continued, for during a landing on January
23rd, 1833, at Eastbourne, the smugglers, who had assembled in
large numbers, p.
101killed George Pett, chief boatman of the local
preventive station, and ran their cargo safely.&nbsp; Several of
both sides were wounded on this occasion, but no one among the
smugglers was ever arrested.
The last fatal happening in this way along the Sussex coast
appears to have been in the marshes at Camber Castle, on April
1st, 1838, when a poor fiddler of Winchelsea, named Thomas Monk,
was shot in the course of a dispute over run goods, by the
coastguard.
But we may quite easily have a surfeit of these brutal
affrays, and it is better to dwell on a lighter note, to
contemplate the audacity, and to admire the ingenuity and the
resource often displayed by the smugglers in concealing their
movements.
To especially single out any particular line of coast for
pre-eminence in smuggling would be impossible.&nbsp; When every
one smuggled, and every one else&mdash;owing to that
well-understood human foible of buying in the cheapest
market&mdash;supported smuggling by purchasing smuggled goods,
every foreshore that did not actually present physical
difficulties, or that was not exceptionally under excise and
customs surveillance, was a free port, in a very special
signification.&nbsp; The thickly peopled coast-line of Kent,
Sussex, and Hampshire of our own time was then sparsely
populated, and those shores that are now but thinly settled were
in that age the merest aching wildernesses, where not only towns,
but even villages and hamlets, were few and far apart.&nbsp; A
coast-line such as p.
102that at Brighton would seem to us to present certain
obvious difficulties to the smuggler, but close at hand was the
low-lying land of Shoreham, with its lagoon-like harbour, a very
shy, secretive kind of place, to this day; while away to
Worthing, and beyond it, stretched a waste of shingle-beach,
running up to solitary pasture-lands that reached to the foot of
the noble rampart of the South Downs.&nbsp; On these shores the
free-traders landed their illegal imports with little
interference, and their shore-going allies received the goods and
took them inland, to London or to their intermediate storehouses
in the country-side, very much at their leisure.&nbsp; Avoiding
the much-travelled high-roads, and traversing the chalk-downs by
unfrequented bridle-tracks, they went across the level Weald and
past the Surrey border into that still lonely district running
east and west for many miles, on the line of Leith Hill, Ewhurst,
and Hindhead.&nbsp; There, along those wooded heights, whose
solitary ways still astonish, with their remote aspect, the
Londoner who by any chance comes to them, although but from
thirty to thirty-five miles from the Bank of England in the City
of London, you may still track, amid the pine-trees on the
shoulders of the gorsy hills, or among the oaks that grow so
luxuriantly in the Wealden clay, the &ldquo;soft roads,&rdquo; as
the country folk call them, along which the smugglers,
unmolested, carried their merchandise.&nbsp; On Ewhurst Hill
stands a windmill, to which in those times the smugglers&rsquo;
ways converged; and <span
class="pagenum">p. 103near by, boldly perched on a height,
along the sylvan road that leads from Shere to Ewhurst village,
stood the &ldquo;Windmill,&rdquo; once the &ldquo;New&rdquo; inn,
which had a double roof, utilised as a storehouse for clandestine
kegs.&nbsp; A &ldquo;Windmill&rdquo; inn stands on the spot
to-day, but it is a new building, the old house having
unfortunately been burned down some two years since.&nbsp;
Surveying the country from this spot, you have, on the one hand,
almost precipitous hill-peaks, gorsy to their summits, and on the
other a lovely dale, deeply embosomed in woods.&nbsp; The
sub-soil here is a soft yellow sandstone, streaked with white
sand, breaking out along the often hollow paths into miniature
cliffs, in which the smugglers and their allies were not slow to
scoop caverns and store part of their stock.&nbsp; We have
already learnt how terrible these men could be to those who
informed against them or made away with any of their property,
and by direct consequence the goods thus stored were generally
safe, either from the authorities or from the rustics, who had a
very wholesome and well-founded dread of the smuggling
bands.&nbsp; But they had a way of their own of letting these
justly dreaded folk see that their stores were evident to some,
and that silence was supposed to have a certain market
value.&nbsp; Their way was just a delicate hint, which consisted
in marking a tub or two with a chalk cross; and, sure enough,
when the stock was removed, those chalk-marked tubs were left
behind, with possibly, if the country-folk had been modest and
the p.
104smugglers were generous, a few others to keep them
company.




An old brick-and-tile-hung farm, down below Ewhurst Hill,
older than it looks, known as Barhatch, was in those times in
possession of the Ticknor family; and still, in what was the old
living-room, may be seen the inglenook, with its iron crane,
marked &ldquo;John Ticknor, 1755.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Barhatch woods
were often used by smugglers, and the Ticknors never had any
occasion to purchase spirits, because, at not infrequent
intervals, when the household arose, and the front door was
opened in the morning, a keg would be found deposited on the
steps: a complimentary keg, for the use of the Ticknor property
and the discretion of the Ticknor tongue.
One of the choicest landing-places along the Sussex coast must
undoubtedly have been just westward of Worthing, by Goring, where
the shore is yet secluded, and is even now not readily come at by
good roads.&nbsp; In a line with it is Highdown Hill, a rounded
hump of the Downs, rising to a height of two hundred and
ninety-nine feet, two miles inland; a spot famed in all guidebook
lore of this neighbourhood as the site of the
&ldquo;Miller&rsquo;s Tomb.&rdquo;&nbsp; This miller, whose real
business of grinding corn seems to have been supplemented by
participation in the stern joys of illegal importation, was one
John Olliver.&nbsp; His mill was situated on this hill-top: a
very remote spot, even now, arrived at only along lanes in which
mud and water plentifully await the explorer&rsquo;s <a
name="page105">p. 105cautious
foot, and where brambles and intrudant twigs, currycomb his
whiskers, if he have such.




John Olliver, miller, was an eighteenth-century eccentric,
whose morbid fancy for having his coffin made early in life, and
wheeled under his bed every night, was not satisfied until he had
also built himself a tomb on the hill-top, on a twelve-foot
square plot of ground granted him by the landowner, one W. W.
Richardson, in 1766: a tomb on which he could with satisfaction
look every day.&nbsp; Yet he was not the dull, dispirited man one
might for these things suppose; and Pennant, in his Tour in
Sussex, is found saying, &ldquo;I am told he is a stout,
active, cheerful man.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then comes this
significant passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides his proper trade he
carries on a very considerable one in smuggled
goods.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us pause a moment to reflect upon the
impudent public manner in which John Olliver must have carried on
his smuggling activities.&nbsp; To this impudence he added also
figures on his house-top, representing a miller filling a sack
and a smuggler chased by an exciseman with a drawn sword; after
the exciseman coming a woman with a broom, belabouring him about
the head.&nbsp; The tomb the miller had built for eventual
occupation by his body was in the meanwhile generally occupied by
spirits&mdash;not the spirits of the dead, but such eaux de
vie as hollands and cognac; and he himself was not laid here
for many years, for he lived to be eighty-four years of age, and
died in 1793.&nbsp; He had long been widely known as an
eccentric, p.
106and thousands came to his funeral on the unconsecrated
spot.&nbsp; Here the tomb, of the altar-tomb type, stands to this
day, kept in excellent repair, and the lengthy inscriptions
repainted; at whose costs and charges I know not.&nbsp; A small
grove of trees almost entirely encircles it.&nbsp; At one end is
a gruesome little sculpture representing Death, as a skeleton,
laying a hand upon an affrighted person, and asking him,
&ldquo;Whither away so fast?&rdquo; and at the other end are the
following lines:
Why fhould my fancy anyone offend
Whofe good or ill does not on it depend
(A generous gift) on which my Tomb doth ftand
This is the only fpot that I have chofe
Wherein to take my lafting long repofe
Here in the drift my body lieth down
You&rsquo;ll fay it is not confecrated ground,
I grant ye fame; but where shall we e&rsquo;er find<br
/>
The fpot that e&rsquo;er can purify the mind?
Nor to the body any luftre give.
This more depends on what a life we live
For when ye trumpet fhall begin to found
&rsquo;Twill not avail where&rsquo;er ye Body&rsquo;s
found.
Blefsed are they and all who in the Lord the Saviour die
Their bodief wait Redemption day,
And fleep in peace where&rsquo;er they lay.

On the upper slab are a number of texts and highly moral
reflections.
As for the Selsey Peninsula, and the district of flat lands
and oozy creeks south of Chichester and on to Portsmouth, Nature
would seem almost to have constructed the entire surroundings
with the especial objects of securing the smugglers and <a
name="page107">p. 107confounding
the customs.&nbsp; Here Sussex merges into Hampshire.




Among the many smuggling nooks along the Hampshire coast,
Langston Harbour was prominent, forming, as it does, an almost
landlocked lagoon, with creeks ramifying toward Portsea Island on
one side and Hayling Island on the other.&nbsp; There still
stands on a quay by the waterside at Langston the old
&ldquo;Royal Oak&rdquo; inn, which was a favourite
gathering-place of the &ldquo;free-traders&rdquo; of these parts,
neighboured by a ruined windmill of romantic aspect, to which no
stories particularly attach, but whose lowering, secretive
appearance aptly accentuates the queer reputation of the
spot.
The reputation of Langston Harbour was such that an ancient
disused brig, the Griper, was permanently stationed here,
with the coastguard housed aboard, to keep watch upon the very
questionable goings and comings of the sailor-folk and fishermen
of the locality.&nbsp; And not only these watery folk needed
watching, but also the people of Havant and the oyster-fishers of
Emsworth.&nbsp; Here, too, just outside Havant, at the village of
Bedhampton, upon the very margin of the mud, stands an
eighteenth-century mill.&nbsp; It would have been profitable for
the coastguard to keep an eye upon this huge old corn-milling
establishment, if the legends be at all true that are told of
it.&nbsp; A little stream, issuant from the Forest of Bere, at
this point runs briskly into the creek, after having been penned
up and made p.
108to form a mill-leat.&nbsp; It runs firstly, moat-like,
in front of a charming old house, formerly the miller&rsquo;s
residence, and then to the great waterwheel, and the mill itself,
a tall, four-square building of red brick, not at all beautiful,
but with a certain air of reserve all the more apparent, of
course, because it is now deserted, bolted, and barred: steam
flour-mills of more modern construction having, it may be
supposed, successfully competed with its antiquated ways.&nbsp;
But at no time, if we are to believe local legend, did Bedhampton
Mill depend greatly upon its milling for prosperity.&nbsp; It was
rather a smugglers&rsquo; storehouse, and the grinding of corn
was, if not altogether an affectation, something of a
by-product.&nbsp; You may readily understand the working of the
contraband business, under these specious pretences, beneath the
very noses of coastguard and excise; how goods brought up the
creek and stored in this capacious hold could, without suspicion
incurred, be taken out of store, loaded in among the flour-sacks
in the miller&rsquo;s wagons, and delivered wherever
desired.&nbsp; Of course, that being the mill&rsquo;s staple
business, it is quite readily understood that when the business
of smuggling declined such milling as went forward here did by no
means suffice to keep the great building going.
The house, which appears now to be let as a country residence
for the summer to persons who neither know nor care anything
about the story of the place, has an odd inscription on its
gable:
p.
109The gift of Mr. George
Judge at Stubbington
Farm at Portsea Hard, in
Memory of his very good Friend,
Mr. George Champ,
Senr. 1742.

That sporadic cases of smuggling long continued in these
districts, as elsewhere, after the smuggling era was really
ended, we may see from one of the annual reports issued by the
Commissioners of Customs.&nbsp; The following incident occurred
in 1873, and is thus officially described:
&ldquo;On the top of a bank rising directly from
highwater-mark in one of the muddy creeks of Southampton Water
stands a wooden hut commanding a full view of it, and surrounded
by an ill-cultivated garden.&nbsp; There are houses near, but the
hut does not belong to them, and appears to have been built for
no obvious purpose.&nbsp; An old smuggler was traced to this hut,
and from that time, for nearly two months, the place was watched
with great precaution, until at midnight, on May 28th, two men
employed by us being on watch, a boat was observed coming from a
small vessel about a mile from the shore.&nbsp; The boat,
containing four men, stopped opposite the hut, landed one man and
some bags, while the remainder of the crew took her some two
hundred yards off, hauled her up, and then proceeded to the
hut.&nbsp; One of our men was instantly despatched for
assistance, while the other remained, watching.&nbsp; On his
return with three policemen, the whole party went to the hut,
where they found p.
110two men on watch outside and four inside, asleep.&nbsp;
A horse and cart were also found in waiting, the cart having a
false bottom.&nbsp; The six men were secured and sent to the
police-station; a boat was then procured, the vessel whence the
men had come was boarded, and found to be laden with tobacco and
spirits.&nbsp; The result was that the vessel, a smack of about
fifteen tons, with eighty-five bales of leaf-tobacco, six boxes
of Cavendish, with some cigars and spirits, was seized, and four
of the persons concerned in the transaction convicted of the
offence.&rdquo;

The doings of the Kentish and
Sussex gangs entirely overshadow the annals of smuggling in other
counties; and altogether, to the general reader, those two
seaboards and the coasts of Devon and Cornwall stand out as
typical scenes.&nbsp; But no part of our shores was immune;
although the longer sea-passages to be made elsewhere of course
stood greatly in the way of the &ldquo;free-traders&rdquo; of
those less favoured regions.&nbsp; After Kent and Sussex, the
east coast was probably the most favourable for smuggling.&nbsp;
The distance across the North Sea might be greater and the
passage often rough, but the low muddy shores and ramifying
creeks of Essex and the sandy coastwise warrens of Suffolk,
Norfolk, and Lincolnshire, very sparsely inhabited, offered their
own peculiar facilities for the shy and secretive trade.
Nor did the East Anglian smugglers display <a
name="page112">p. 112much less
ferocity when their interests were threatened, or their goods
seized, than was shown by the yokels of those other
counties.&nbsp; The stolid, ox-like rustics of the country-side
there, as along the margin of the English Channel, were roused to
almost incredible acts of brutality which do not seem to have
been repeated in the West.
We do not find the hardy seafaring smugglers often behaving
with the cold-blooded cruelty displayed, as a usual phenomenon,
by the generally unemotional men of ploughed fields and rustic
communities who took up the running and carried the goods inland
from the water&rsquo;s edge whither those sea-dogs had brought
them.&nbsp; In the being of the men who dared tempestuous winds
and waves there existed, as a rule, a more sportsmanlike and
generous spirit.&nbsp; Something of the traditional heartiness
inseparable from sea-life impelled them to give and take without
the black blood that seethed evilly in the veins of the
landsmen.&nbsp; The seamen, it seemed, realised that smuggling
was a risk; something in the nature of any game of skill, into
which they entered, with the various officers of the law
naturally opposed to them; and when either side won, that was
incidental to the game, and no enmity followed as the matter of
course it was with their shore-going partners.
Perhaps these considerations, as greatly as the difference in
racial characters, show us why the land-smugglers of the Home
Counties should have been so criminal, while from the Devon <a
name="page113">p. 113and Cornish
contrabandists we hear mostly of humorous passages.




At Beccles, in Suffolk, for example, we find the record, in
1744, of an incident that smacks rather of the Hawkhurst type of
outrage.&nbsp; Smugglers there pulled a man out of bed, whipped
him, tied him naked on a horse, and rode away with their
prisoner, who was never again heard of, although a reward of
&pound;50 was offered.
Colchester was the scene, on April 16th, 1847, of as bold an
act as the breaking open of the custom-house at Poole.&nbsp; At
two o&rsquo;clock in the morning two men arrived at the quay at
Hythe, by Colchester, and, with the story that they were revenue
officers come to lodge a seizure of captured goods, asked to be
shown the way to the custom-house.&nbsp; They had no sooner been
shown it than there followed thirty smugglers, well armed with
blunderbusses and pistols, who, with a heavy blacksmith&rsquo;s
hammer and a crowbar, broke open the warehouse, in which a large
quantity of dutiable goods was stored.&nbsp; They were not
molested in their raid, and went off with sixty oil-bags,
containing 1514 lb. of tea that had been seized near Woodbridge
Haven.&nbsp; No one dared interfere with them, and by six
o&rsquo;clock that morning they had proceeded as far as Hadleigh,
from which point all trace of them was lost.
Canvey Island, in the estuary of the Thames, off Benfleet,
with its quaint old Dutch houses, relics of the seventeenth and
eighteenth-century p.
114Hollanders who settled there and carried on a more than
questionable business, was reputedly a nest of smugglers.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Lobster Smack,&rdquo; a quaint old weatherboarded inn
built just within the old earthen sea-wall for which those
Dutchmen were responsible, and standing somewhat below the level
of high water, has legends of smuggling that naturally do not
lose by age or repetition.
The Blackwater estuary, running up from the Essex coast to
Maldon, offered peculiar facilities for smuggling; and that,
perhaps, is why a coastguard vessel is still stationed at
Stansgate, half way along its length, opposite Osea Island.&nbsp;
At the mouth of the Blackwater there branch other creeks and
estuaries leading past Mersea Island to Colchester; and here,
looking out upon a melancholy sea, and greatly resembling a barn,
stands the ancient chapel of St. Peter-upon-the-Wall, situated in
one of the most lonely spots conceivable, on what were, ages ago,
the ramparts of the Roman station of Othona.&nbsp; It has
long been used as a barn, and was in smuggling times a frequent
rendezvous of the night-birds who waged ceaseless war with the
Customs.
Two miles onward, along sea and river-bank, Bradwell Quay is
reached, where the &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo; inn in these times
turns a hospitable face to the wayfarer, but was in the
&ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; apt to distrust the casual
stranger, for it was a house &ldquo;ower sib&rdquo; with the
free-traders, and Pewit Island, just off the quay, a desolate
islet almost awash, formed an admirable emergency <a
name="page115">p.
115store.&nbsp; The old stone-floored kitchen of the
&ldquo;Green Man,&rdquo; nowadays a cool and refreshing place in
which to take a modest quencher on a summer&rsquo;s day, still
remains very much what it was of old; and the quaint fireplace
round which the sly longshore men of these Essex creeks
foregathered on those winter nights when work was before them
keeps its old-time pot-racks and hooks.




Among the very numerous accounts of smuggling affrays we may
exhume from the musty files of old newspapers, we read of the
desperate encounter in which Mr. Toby, Supervisor of Excise, lost
an eye in contending with a gang of smugglers at Caister, near
Yarmouth, in April 1816; which shows&mdash;if we had occasion to
show&mdash;that the East Anglian could on occasion be as
ferocious as the rustics of the south.
The shores of East Anglia we have already noted to be largely
composed of wide-spreading sandy flats, in whose wastes the
tracks of wild birds and animals&mdash;to say nothing of the
deeply indented footmarks of heavily-laden men&mdash;are easily
distinguished; and the chief problem of the free-traders of those
parts was therefore often how to cover up the tracks they left so
numerously in their passage across to the hard roads.&nbsp; In
this resort the shepherds were their mainstay, and for the usual
consideration, i.e. a keg of the &ldquo;right
stuff,&rdquo; would presently, after the gang had passed, come
driving their flocks along in the sandy trail they had left:
completely p.
116obliterating all evidences of a run of contraband goods
having been successfully brought off.
Blakeney, on the Norfolk coast, is associated with one of the
best, and most convincing, tales ever told of smuggling.&nbsp;
This coast is rich in what are known as &ldquo;cart gaps&rdquo;:
dips in the low cliffs, where horses and carts may readily gain
access to the sea.&nbsp; These places were, of course, especially
well watched by the preventive men, who often made a rich haul
out of the innocent-looking farm-carts, laden with seaweed for
manure, that were often to be observed being driven landwards at
untimeous hours of night and early morn.&nbsp; Beneath the
seaweed were, of course, numerous kegs.&nbsp; Sometimes the
preventive men confiscated horses and carts, as well as their
loads, and all were put up for sale.&nbsp; On one of these
painful occasions the local custom-house officer, who knew a
great deal more of the sea and its ways than he did of horses,
was completely taken in by a farmer-confederate of the smugglers
whose horses had been seized.&nbsp; The farmer went to make an
offer for the animals, and was taken to see them.&nbsp; The
season of the year was the spring, when, as the poet observes,
&ldquo;a young man&rsquo;s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of
love&rdquo;&mdash;and when horses shed their coats.&nbsp; Up went
the farmer to the nearest horse, and easily, of course, pulled
out a handful of hair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, in the
East Anglian way, &ldquo;th&rsquo; poor brute hey gotten t&rsquo;
mange, and all tudderuns &rsquo;ull ketch it, of yow baint
keerful.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he <span
class="pagenum">p. 117examined &ldquo;tudderuns,&rdquo;
and behold! each had caught it: and so he bought the lot
for five pounds.&nbsp; That same night every horse was back in
its own stable.
Searching in graveyards is not perhaps the most exhilarating
of pastimes or employments, but it, at any rate, is likely to
bring, on occasion, curious local history to light.&nbsp; Not
infrequently, in the old churchyards of seaboard parishes,
epitaphs bearing upon the story of smuggling may be found.
Among these often quaint and curious, as well as tragical,
relics, that in Hunstanton churchyard, on the coast of Norfolk,
is pre-eminent, both for its grotesquely ungrammatical character
and for the history that attaches to the affair:
In Memory of William
Webb, late of the 15th Lt. D&rsquo;ns,
who was shot from his Horse by a party of Smugglers
on the 26 of Sepr. 1784.
I am not dead, but sleepeth here,
And when the Trumpet Sound I will appear.
Four balls thro&rsquo; me Pearced there way:
Hard it was.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d no time to pray
This stone that here you Do see
My Comerades erected for the sake of me.

Two smugglers, William Kemble and Andrew Gunton, were
arraigned for the murder of this dragoon and an excise
officer.&nbsp; The jury, much to the surprise of every one, for
the guilt of the prisoners was undoubted, brought in a verdict of
&ldquo;Not guilty&rdquo;; whereupon Mr. Murphy, counsel for the
prosecution, moved for a new trial, observing that if a Norfolk
jury were p.
118determined not to convict persons guilty of the most
obvious crimes, simply because, as smugglers, they commanded the
sympathy of the country people, there was an end of all
justice.
A second jury was forthwith empanelled and the evidence
repeated, and after three hours&rsquo; deliberation the prisoners
were again found &ldquo;Not guilty,&rdquo; and were, in
accordance with that finding, acquitted and liberated.
It is abundantly possible that the foregoing incident had some
connection with that locally favourite smugglers&rsquo; route
from the Norfolk coast inland, the Peddar&rsquo;s Way, which runs
a long and lonely course from Holme, near Hunstanton, right
through Norfolk into Suffolk, and is for the greater part of its
length a broad, grassy track, romantically lined and overhung
with fine trees.&nbsp; Such ancient ways, including the many old
drove-roads in the north, never turnpiked, made capital soft
going, and, rarely touching villages or hamlets, were of a highly
desirable, secretive nature.&nbsp; The origin of the
Peddar&rsquo;s, or Padder&rsquo;s, Way is still in dispute among
antiquaries, some seeing in it a Roman road, others conceiving it
to be a prehistoric track; but the broad, straight character of
it seems to point to this long route having been Romanised.&nbsp;
Its great age is evident on many accounts, not least among them
being that the little town of Watton, near but not on it, is
named from this prehistoric road, &ldquo;Way-town,&rdquo; while
that county division, the hundred, is the Hundred of Wayland.

Not so much smuggling incident as
might be expected is found along the coasts of Dorset and Devon,
but that is less on account of any lack of smuggling encounters
in those parts than because less careful record has been kept of
them.&nbsp; An early epitaph on a smuggler, to be seen in the
churchyard of Kinson, just within the Dorset boundary, in an
out-of-the-way situation at the back of Bournemouth, in a
district formerly of almost trackless heaths, will sufficiently
show that smuggling was active here:
To the memory of Robert
Trotman, late of Rowd, in
the county of Wilts, who was barbarously murdered
on the shore near Poole, the 24th March, 1765.
A little tea, one leaf I did not steal,
For guiltless bloodshed I to God appeal;
Put tea in one scale, human blood in t&rsquo;other
And think what &rsquo;tis to slay a harmless brother.

This man was shot in an encounter with the revenue
officers.&nbsp; He was one of a gang that used <a
name="page120">p. 120the church
here as a hiding-place.&nbsp; The upper stage of the tower and an
old altar-tomb were the favourite receptacles for their
&ldquo;free-trade&rdquo; merchandise.
Trotman, it will be observed, was of Rowd, or Rowde, in
Wiltshire, two miles from Devizes, and was thus one of the
&ldquo;Wiltshire Moonrakers,&rdquo; whose descriptive title is
due to smuggling history.&nbsp; Among the nicknames conferred
upon the natives of our various shires and counties none is
complimentary.&nbsp; They figure forth undesirable physical
attributes, as when the Lincolnshire folk, dwellers among the
fens, are styled &ldquo;Yellow-bellies,&rdquo; i.e. frogs;
or stupidity, e.g. &ldquo;Silly Suffolk&rdquo;; or
humbug&mdash;for example, &ldquo;Devonshire
Crawlers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wiltshire Moonrakers&rdquo; is
generally considered to be a term of contempt for Wilts rustic
stupidity; but, rightly considered, it is nothing of the
kind.&nbsp; It all depends how you take the story which gave rise
to it.&nbsp; The usual version tells us how a party of
travellers, crossing a bridge in Wiltshire by night when the
harvest moon was shining, observed a group of rustics raking in
the stream, in which the great yellow disc of the moon was
reflected.&nbsp; The travellers had the curiosity to ask them
what it was they raked for in such a place and at so untimeous an
hour; and were told they were trying to get &ldquo;that
cheese&rdquo;&mdash;the moon&mdash;out of the water.&nbsp; The
travellers went on their way amused with the simplicity of these
&ldquo;naturals,&rdquo; and spread the story far and wide.
p. 121But
these apparently idiotic clod-hoppers were wiser in their
generation than commonly supposed, and were, in fact, smugglers
surprised in the act of raking up a number of spirit-kegs that
had been sunk in the bed of the stream until the arrival of a
convenient season when they could with safety be removed.&nbsp;
The travellers, properly considered, were really revenue
officers, scouring the neighbourhood.&nbsp; This version of the
story fairly throws the accusation of innocence and
dunderheadedness back upon them, and clears the Wiltshire rural
character from contempt.&nbsp; It should, however, be said that
the first version of the story is generally told at the expense
of the villagers of Bishop&rsquo;s Cannings, near Devizes, who
have long writhed under a load of ancient satirical narratives,
reflecting upon a lack of common sense alleged to be their chief
characteristic.
Many of the western smuggling stories are of a humorous cast,
rather than of the dreadful blood-boltered kind that disgraces
the history of the home counties.&nbsp; Here is a case in
point.&nbsp; On the evening of Sunday, July 10th, 1825, as two
preventive men were on the look-out for smugglers, near Lulworth
in Dorset, the smugglers, to the number of sixty or seventy,
curiously enough, found them instead, and immediately taking away
their swords and pistols, carried them to the edge of the cliff
and placed them with their heads hanging over the precipice; with
the comfortable assurance that if they made the least noise, or
gave alarm, they should be immediately thrown over.&nbsp; <a
name="page122">p. 122In the
interval a smuggling vessel landed a &ldquo;crop&rdquo; of one
hundred casks, which the shore-gang placed on their horses and
triumphantly carried away.&nbsp; The prisoners were then removed
from their perilous position, and taken into an adjoining field,
where they were bound hand and foot, and left overnight.&nbsp;
They were found the next morning by their comrades, searching for
them.
There are several points in this true tale that suggest it to
have been the original whence Mr. Thomas Hardy obtained the chief
motive of his short story, The Distracted Preacher.
We do not find consecutive accounts of smuggling on this wild
coast of Dorset; but when the veil is occasionally lifted and we
obtain a passing glimpse, it is a picturesque scene that is
disclosed.&nbsp; Thus, a furious encounter took place under St.
Aldhelm&rsquo;s Head, in 1827, between an armed band of some
seventy or eighty smugglers and the local preventive men, who
numbered only ten, but gave a good account of themselves, two
smugglers being reported killed on the spot, and many others
wounded, while some of the preventive force, during the progress
of the fight, quietly slipped to where the smugglers&rsquo; boats
had been left and made off with the goods stored in them.
&ldquo;The smugglers are armed,&rdquo; says a report of this
affair, &ldquo;with swingels, like flails, with which they can
knock people&rsquo;s brains out&rdquo;; and proceeds to say that
weapons of this kind, often <span
class="pagenum">p. 123delivering blows from unexpected
quarters, are extremely difficult to fight against.
The captain of this gang was a man named Lucas, who kept an
inn called the &ldquo;Ship,&rdquo; at Woolbridge; and,
information being laid, Captain Jackson, the local inspector of
customs, went with an assistant and a police officer from London
to his house at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning and roused
him.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; asked Lucas.
&ldquo;Only I, Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s little girl.&nbsp; I want a
drop of brandy for mother,&rdquo; returned the inspector, in a
piping voice.
&ldquo;Very well, my dear,&rdquo; said the landlord, and
opened the door; to find himself in the grasp of the
police-officer.&nbsp; Henry Fooks, of Knowle, and three others of
the gang, were then arrested; and the whole five committed to
Dorchester gaol.
The wild coast of Dorset, if we except Poole Harbour and the
cliffs of Purbeck, yields little to the inquirer in this sort,
although there can be no doubt of smuggling having been in full
operation here.&nbsp; Jack Rattenbury, whose story is told on
another page, could doubtless have rubricated this shore of many
cliffs and remote hamlets with striking instances; and not a
cliff-top but must have frequently exhibited lights to
&ldquo;flash the lugger off,&rdquo; what time the preventive men
were on the prowl; and no lonely strand but must have witnessed
the smugglers, when the coast was again clear, rowing out <a
name="page124">p. 124and
&ldquo;creeping for the crop&rdquo; that had been sunk and
buoyed, or &ldquo;put in the collar,&rdquo; as the saying
went.
A relic of these for the most part unrecorded and forgotten
incidents is found in the epitaph at Wyke, near Weymouth, on one
William Lewis:
Sacred to the memory<br
/>
of
WILLIAM LEWIS,
who was killed by a shot
from the Pigmy Schooner
21st April 1822, aged 53 years.


&nbsp;
Of life bereft (by fell design),
&nbsp;&nbsp; I mingle with my fellow clay,
On God&rsquo;s protection I recline
&nbsp;&nbsp; To save me on the Judgment-day.
There shall each blood-stain&rsquo;d soul appear,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Repent, all, ere it be too late,
Or Else a dreadful doom you&rsquo;ll hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp; For God will sure avenge my fate.


&nbsp;
This Stone is Erected
by his Wife
as the last mark of respect to an
Affectionate Husband.

The inscription is surmounted by a representation, carved in
low relief, of the Pigmy schooner chasing the smuggling
vessel.
Old folk, now gone from the scene of their reminiscences, used
to tell of this tragedy, and of the landing of the body of the
unfortunate Lewis on the rocks of Sandsfoot Castle, where the
ragged, roofless walls of that old seaward fortress impend over
the waves, and the great bulk of Portland isle glooms in mid
distance upon the bay.&nbsp; They tell, too, how the inscription
was long p.
125kept gilded by his relatives; but the last trace of it
has long since vanished.
Many miles intervene, and another county must be entered,
before another tragical epitaph bearing upon smuggling is
found.&nbsp; If you go to Seaton, in South Devon, and walk inland
from the modern developments of that now rapidly growing town to
the old church, you may see there a tablet recording the sad fate
of William Henry Paulson, midshipman of H.M.S. Queen
Charlotte, and eight seamen, who all perished in a gale of
wind off Sidmouth, while cruising in a galley after smugglers, in
the year 1816.
A few miles westward, through Beer to Branscombe, the country
is of a very wild and lonely kind.&nbsp; In the weird, eerie
churchyard of Branscombe, in which astonishing epitaphs of all
kinds abound, is a variant upon the smugglers&rsquo; violent
ends, in the inscription to one &ldquo;Mr. John Harley, Custom
House Officer of this parish.&rdquo;&nbsp; It proceeds to narrate
how, &ldquo;as he was endeavouring to extinguish some Fire made
between Beer and Seaton as a signal to a Smuggling Boat then off
at sea, he fell by some means or other from the top of the cliff
to the bottom, by which he was unfortunately killed.&nbsp; This
unhappy accident happened the 9th day of August in the year of
our Lord 1755, &aelig;tatis su&aelig; 45.&nbsp; He was an
active and diligent officer and very inoffensive in his life and
conversation.&rdquo;
So here was another martyr to the conditions created by bad
government.
p. 126The
estuary of the Exe, between Exmouth and Starcross, was for many
years greatly favoured by smugglers, for, as may readily be
perceived to this day, there lay in the two-miles-broad channel,
where sea and river mingle, a wide, wild stretch of sand, almost
awash at high water, heaped up in towans overgrown with tussocks
of coarse, sour grasses, or sinking into hollows full of brackish
water: pleasant in daytime, but a dangerous place at night.&nbsp;
Here, in this islanded waste, there were no roads nor tracks at
all, and few were those who ever came to disturb the curlews or
the seabirds that nested, unafraid.&nbsp; In these
twentieth-century times of ours the Warren&mdash;for such is the
name of this curiously amphibious place&mdash;has become a place
of picnic parties on summer afternoons, largely by favour of the
Great Western Railway having provided, midway between the
stations of Starcross and Dawlish, a little platform called the
&ldquo;Warren Halt.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in those times before
railways, when the Warren was not easily come at, the smugglers
found it a highly convenient place for their business.&nbsp;
Beside it, under the lee of Langston Point, there is a sheltered
strand, and, at such times when it was considered quite safe, the
sturdy free-traders quietly ran their boats ashore here, on the
yellow sands, and conveyed their contents to the &ldquo;Mount
Pleasant&rdquo; inn, which is an unassuming&mdash;and was in
those times a still more unassuming&mdash;house, perched
picturesquely on the crest of a red sandstone bluff which rises
inland, sheer from the <span
class="pagenum">p. 127marshy meadows.&nbsp; It was a very
convenient receiving-house and signal-station for all of this
trade, for it owned caverns hollowed out of the red sandstone in
places inaccessible to the authorities, and from its isolated
height, overlooking the flats, could easily communicate
encouragement or warning to friends anxiously riding at anchor
out at sea.&nbsp; The lights that flashed on dark and tempestuous
nights from its high-hung rustic balcony were significant.&nbsp;
The only man who could have told much of the smugglers&rsquo;
secrets here was the unfortunate Lieutenant Palk, who lay wait
one such night upon the Warren.&nbsp; But dead men tell no tales;
and that ill-starred officer was found in the morning, drowned,
face downwards, in a shallow pool, whether by accident or design
there was nothing to show.&nbsp; As already remarked, the Warren
was a dangerous place to wander in after dark.
It is quite vain nowadays to seek for the smugglers&rsquo;
caves at Mount Pleasant.&nbsp; They were long ago filled up.
In these times the holiday-maker, searching for shells, is the
only feature of the sands that fringe the seaward edge of the
Warren.&nbsp; It is a fruitful hunting-ground for such,
especially after rough weather.&nbsp; But the day following a
storm was, in those times, the opportunity of the local revenue
men, who, forming a strong party, were used to take boat and pull
down here and thoroughly search the foreshore; for at such times
any spirit-tubs that might have been sunk out at sea and <a
name="page128">p. 128carefully
buoyed by the smugglers, awaiting a favourable time for landing,
were apt to break loose and drift in-shore.&nbsp; There was
always, at such times, a sporting chance of a good haul.&nbsp;
But, on the other hand, some of the many tubs that had been sunk
months before, and lost, would on these occasions come to hand,
and they were worth just nothing at all: long immersion in salt
water having spoiled their contents, with the result that what
had been right good hollands or cognac had become a peculiarly
ill-savoured liquid, which smelt to heaven when it was
broached.&nbsp; The revenue people called this abominable stuff,
which, as Shakespeare might say, had &ldquo;suffered a sea-change
into something new and strange,&rdquo; by the appropriate name of
&ldquo;stinkibus.&rdquo;

Cornwall is the region of romance:
the last corner of England in which legend and imagination had
full play, while matter-of-fact already sat enthroned over the
rest of the land.&nbsp; At a time when newspapers almost
everywhere had already long been busily recording facts, legends
were still in the making throughout this westernmost part of the
island.&nbsp; We may, in our innocence, style Cornwall a part of
England; but the Cornish do not think of it as such, and when
they cross the Tamar into Devonshire will still often speak of
&ldquo;going into England.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are historically
correct in doing so, for this is the unconquered land of the
Cornu-Welsh, never assimilated by the Saxon kingdoms.&nbsp;
Historically and ethnologically, the Cornish are a people
apart.
The Coppinger legend is a case in point, illustrating the
growth of wild stories out of meagre facts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cruel
Coppinger&rdquo; is a <span
class="pagenum">p. 130half-satanic, semi-viking character
in the tales of North Cornwall and North Devon, of whom no
visitor is likely to remain ignorant, for not only was he a dread
figure of local folklore from about the first quarter of the
nineteenth century, but he was written up in 1866 by the Reverend
R. S. Hawker, Vicar of Morwenstow, who not only collated those
floating stories, but added very much of his own, for Hawker was
a man&mdash;and a not very scrupulous man&mdash;of
imagination.&nbsp; Hawker&rsquo;s presentment of &ldquo;Cruel
Coppinger&rdquo; was published in a popular magazine, and then
the legend became full-blown.
The advent of Coppinger upon the coast at Welcombe Mouth, near
where Devon and Cornwall join, was dramatic.&nbsp; The story
tells how a strange vessel went to pieces on the reefs and how
only one person escaped with his life, in the midst of a howling
tempest.&nbsp; This was the skipper, a Dane named
Coppinger.&nbsp; On the beach, on foot and on horseback, was a
crowd, waiting, in the usual Cornish way, for any wreck of the
sea that might be thrown up.&nbsp; Into the midst of them, like
some sea-monster, dashed this sole survivor, and bounded suddenly
upon the crupper of a young damsel who had ridden to the shore to
see the sight.&nbsp; He grasped her bridle, and, shouting in a
foreign tongue, urged the doubly-laden animal to full speed, and
the horse naturally took his usual way home.&nbsp; The damsel was
Miss Dinah Hamlyn.&nbsp; The stranger descended at her
father&rsquo;s door and lifted her off her saddle.&nbsp; He <a
name="page131">p. 131then
announced himself as a Dane, named Coppinger, and took his place
at the family board and there remained until he had secured the
affections and hand of Dinah.&nbsp; The father died, and
Coppinger succeeded to the management and control of the house,
which thenceforward became the refuge of every lawless character
along the coast.&nbsp; All kinds of wild uproar and reckless
revelry appalled the neighbourhood, night and day.&nbsp; It was
discovered that an organised band of smugglers, wreckers, and
poachers made this house their rendezvous, and that &ldquo;Cruel
Coppinger&rdquo; was their captain.&nbsp; In those times no
revenue officer durst exercise vigilance west of the Tamar, and,
to put an end at once to all such surveillance, the head of a
gauger was chopped off by one of Coppinger&rsquo;s gang, on the
gunwale of a boat.
Strange vessels began to appear at regular intervals on the
coast, and signals were flashed from the headlands, to lead them
into the safest creek or cove.&nbsp; Amongst these, one, a
full-rigged schooner, soon became ominously conspicuous.&nbsp;
She was for long the terror of those shores, and her name was the
Black Prince.&nbsp; Once, with Coppinger aboard, she led a
revenue cutter into an intricate channel near the Bull Rock,
where, from knowledge of the bearings, the Black Prince
escaped scathless, while the King&rsquo;s vessel perished with
all on board.&nbsp; In those times, if any landsman became
obnoxious to Coppinger&rsquo;s men, he was seized and carried
aboard the Black Prince, <span
class="pagenum">p. 132and obliged to save his life by
enrolling himself as one of the crew.
Amid such practices, ill-gotten gold began to accrue to
Coppinger.&nbsp; At one time he had enough money to purchase a
freehold farm bordering on the sea.&nbsp; When the day of
transfer came, he and one of his followers appeared before the
lawyer and paid the money in dollars, ducats, doubloons, and
pistoles.&nbsp; The lawyer objected, but Coppinger, with an oath,
bade him take that or none.
Long impunity increased Coppinger&rsquo;s daring.&nbsp; Over
certain bridle-paths along the fields he exercised exclusive
control, and issued orders that no man was to pass over them by
night.&nbsp; They were known as &ldquo;Coppinger&rsquo;s
Tracks,&rdquo; and all converged at a cliff called &ldquo;Steeple
Brink.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the precipice fell sheer to the sea, 300
feet, with overhanging eaves a hundred feet from the
summit.&nbsp; Under this part was a cave, only to be reached by a
rope-ladder from above.&nbsp; This was &ldquo;Coppinger&rsquo;s
Cave.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here sheep were tethered to the rock and fed
on stolen hay and corn until slaughtered.&nbsp; Kegs of brandy
and hollands were piled around; chests of tea, and iron-bound
sea-chests contained the chattels and revenues of the Coppinger
royalty of the sea.
The terror linked with Coppinger&rsquo;s name throughout the
north coasts of Cornwall and Devon was so extreme that the people
themselves, wild and lawless though they were, submitted to his
sway as though he had been lord of the soil, and they his
vassals.&nbsp; Such a household as his was, <a
name="page133">p. 133of course,
far from happy or calm.&nbsp; Although, when his father-in-law
died, he had insensibly acquired possession of the stock and
farm, there remained in the hands of the widow a considerable
amount of money.&nbsp; This he obtained from the helpless woman
by instalments, and by force.&nbsp; He would fasten his wife to
the pillar of her oak bedstead, and call her mother into the
room, and assure her he would flog Dinah with a
cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails till her mother had transferred to him
what he wanted.&nbsp; This act of brutal cruelty he repeated
until he had utterly exhausted the widow&rsquo;s store.
There was but one child of Coppinger&rsquo;s marriage.&nbsp;
It was a boy, and deaf and dumb, but mischievous and
ungovernable, delighting in cruelty to other children, animals,
or birds.&nbsp; When he was but six years of age, he was found
one day, hugging himself with delight, and pointing down from the
brink of a cliff to the beach, where the body of a
neighbour&rsquo;s child was found and it was believed that little
Coppinger had flung him over.&nbsp; It was a saying in the
district that, as a judgment on his father&rsquo;s cruelty, the
child had been born without a human soul.
But the end arrived.&nbsp; Money became scarce, and more than
one armed King&rsquo;s cutter was seen, day and night, hovering
off the land.&nbsp; And at last Coppinger, &ldquo;who came with
the water, went with the wind.&rdquo;&nbsp; A wrecker, watching
the shore, saw, as the sun went down, a full-rigged vessel
standing off and on.&nbsp; Coppinger came to <a
name="page134">p. 134the beach,
put off in a boat to the vessel, and jumped aboard.&nbsp; She
spread canvas, and was seen no more.&nbsp; That night was one of
storm, and whether the vessel rode it out or not, none ever
knew.
It is hardly necessary to add that the Coppinger of these and
other rumbustious stories is a strictly unhistorical Coppinger;
and that, in short, they are mainly efforts of Hawker&rsquo;s own
imagination, built upon very slight folklore traditions.
Who and what, however, was the real Coppinger?&nbsp; Very
little exact information is available, but what we have entirely
demolishes the legendary half-man, half-monster of those
remarkable exploits.
Daniel Herbert Copinger, or Coppinger, was wrecked at Welcombe
Mouth on December 23rd, 1792, and was given shelter beneath the
roof of Mr. William Arthur, yeoman farmer, at Golden Park,
Hartland, where for many years afterwards his name might have
been seen, scratched on a window-pane:
D. H. Coppinger, shipwrecked December 23 1792,
kindly received by Mr. Wm. Arthur.

There is not the slightest authority for the story of his
sensational leap on to the saddle of Miss Dinah Hamlyn; but it is
true enough that the next year he married a Miss Hamlyn&mdash;her
Christian name was Ann&mdash;elder of the two daughters of
Ackland Hamlyn, of Galsham, in Hartland, and in the registers of
Hartland church p.
135may be found this entry: &ldquo;Daniel Herbert
Coppinger, of the King&rsquo;s Royal Navy, and Ann Hamlyn mard.
(by licence) 3 Aug.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;damsel&rdquo; of the
story also turns out, by the cold, calm evidence of this entry,
to have been of the mature age of forty-two.
Mrs. Hamlyn, Coppinger&rsquo;s mother-in-law, died in 1800,
and was buried in the chancel of Hartland church.&nbsp; It is, of
course, quite possible that his married life was stormy and that
he, more or less by force, extracted money from Mrs. Hamlyn, and
he was certainly more or less involved in smuggling.&nbsp; But
that he, or any of his associates, chopped off the head of an
excise officer is not to be credited.&nbsp; Tales are told of
revenue officers searching at Galsham for contraband, and of Mrs.
Coppinger hurriedly hiding a quantity of valuable silks in the
kitchen oven, while her husband engaged their attention in
permitting them to find a number of spirit-kegs, which they
presently found, much to their disgust, to be empty; and,
moreover, empty so long that scarce the ghost of even a smell of
the departed spirit could be traced.&nbsp; But the flurried Mrs.
Coppinger had in her haste done a disastrous thing, for the oven
was in baking trim, and the valuable silks were baked to a
cinder.
Little else is known of Coppinger, and nothing whatever of his
alleged connection with the Navy.&nbsp; He became bankrupt in
1802, and was then a prisoner in the King&rsquo;s Bench
Prison.&nbsp; With him was one Richard Copinger, said to have
been a p.
136merchant in Martinique.&nbsp; Nothing is known of him
after this date, but rumour told how he was living apart from his
wife, at Barnstaple, and subsisting on an allowance from her.
Mrs. Coppinger herself, in after years, resided at Barnstaple,
and died there on August 31st, 1833.&nbsp; She lies buried in the
chancel of Hartland church beside her mother.
According to the Rev. S. Baring-Gould, Coppinger was not
really a Dane, but an Irishman, and had a wife at Trewhiddle near
St. Austell.&nbsp; He, on the same authority, is said to have
done extremely well as a smuggler, and had not only a farm at
Trewhiddle, but another at Roscoff, in Brittany.&nbsp; A
daughter, says Mr. Baring-Gould, married a Trefusis, son of Lord
Clinton, and Coppinger gave her &pound;40,000 as a dowry.&nbsp; A
son married the daughter of Sir John Murray, Bart., of
Stanhope.&nbsp; The source of this interesting information is not
stated.&nbsp; It appears wildly improbable.
Hawker very cleverly embodied the smuggling sentiment of
Cornwall in a sketch he wrote, styled &ldquo;The Light of Other
Days.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It was full six in the evening of an autumn day when a
traveller arrived where the road ran along by a sandy beach just
above high-water mark.&nbsp; The stranger, who was a native of
some inland town, and utterly unacquainted with Cornwall and its
ways, had reached the brink of the tide just as a
&lsquo;landing&rsquo; was coming off.&nbsp; It was a scene not
only to instruct a townsman, but to dazzle and surprise.&nbsp; At
sea, just beyond p.
137the billows, lay the vessel, well moored with anchors
at stem and stern.&nbsp; Between the ship and the shore, boats,
laden to the gunwale, passed to and fro.&nbsp; Crowds assembled
on the beach to help the cargo ashore.&nbsp; On one hand a
boisterous group surrounded a keg with the head knocked in, for
simplicity of access to the good cognac, into which they dipped
whatsoever vessel came first to hand; one man had filled his
shoe.&nbsp; On the other side they fought and wrestled, cursed
and swore.&nbsp; Horrified at what he saw, the stranger lost all
self-command, and, oblivious of personal danger, he began to
shout, &lsquo;What a horrible sight!&nbsp; Have you no
shame?&nbsp; Is there no magistrate at hand?&nbsp; Cannot any
justice of the peace be found in this fearful country?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;No; thanks be to God,&rsquo; answered a gruff,
hoarse voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;None within eight miles.&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; screamed the stranger,
&lsquo;is there no clergyman hereabout?&nbsp; Does no minister of
the parish live among you on this coast?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Aye, to be sure there is,&rsquo; said the same
deep voice.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, how far off does he live?&nbsp; Where is
he?&rsquo;
&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s he, yonder, sir, with the
lantern.&rsquo;
&ldquo;And, sure enough, there he stood on a rock, and poured,
with pastoral diligence, &lsquo;the light of other days&rsquo; on
a busy congregation.&rdquo;




The complete, true story of smuggling along the Cornish coast
will never be told.&nbsp; Those who could have contributed
illuminating chapters to <span
class="pagenum">p. 138it, and would not, are dead, and
those who now would are reduced to seeking details and finding
only scraps.&nbsp; But some of these scraps are not
unpalatable.
Thus we have the story of that Vicar of Maker whose church was
used as a smugglers&rsquo; store.&nbsp; The Vicar was not a party
to these proceedings, as may well be judged by his inviting his
rural dean to ascend to the roof of the church-tower with him,
for sake of the view: the view disclosing not only a lovely
expanse of sea and wooded foreshore, but also a heap of
twenty-three spirit-kegs, reposing in the gutters between the
roofs of nave and aisle.
The &ldquo;Fowey Gallants,&rdquo; as the townsfolk of that
little seaport delighted to call themselves,&mdash;the title
having descended from Elizabethan and even earlier times, when
the &ldquo;Gallants&rdquo; in question were, in plain speech,
nothing less than turbulent seafaring rowdies and
pirates&mdash;were not behind other Cornish folk in their
smuggling enterprises.&nbsp; That prime authority on this part of
the Cornish coast, Jonathan Couch, historian of Polperro, tells
us of an exciting incident at Fowey, in the smuggling way.&nbsp;
On one occasion, the custom-house officers heard of an important
run that had taken place overnight, and accordingly sent out
scouts in every direction to locate the stuff, if possible.&nbsp;
At Landaviddy one of these parties met a farm-labourer whom they
suspected of having taken part in the run.&nbsp; They taxed him
with it, and tried him all ways; <span
class="pagenum">p. 139without effect, until they
threatened to impress him for service in the Navy unless he
revealed the hiding-place of the cognac.&nbsp; His resolution
broke down at that, and he told how the kegs had been hidden in a
large cave at Yellow Rock, which the officers then instructed him
to mark with a chalk cross.
The revenue men then went off for reinforcements, and,
returning, met an armed band of smugglers, who had taken up a
strong position at New Quay Head.&nbsp; They were armed with
sticks, cutlasses, and muskets, and had brought a loaded gun upon
the scene, which they trained upon the cave; while a man with
flaring portfire stood by and dared the officers to remove the
goods.&nbsp; Official prudence counselled the revenue men to
retire for further support; but when they had again returned the
smugglers had disappeared, and the kegs with them.
Fowey&rsquo;s trade in &ldquo;moonshine,&rdquo; i.e.
contraband spirits, was, like that of the Cornish coast in
general, with Roscoff, in Brittany; and a regular service was
maintained for years.&nbsp; As late as 1832 the luggers
Eagle, thirty-five tons; Rose, eleven tons; and
Dove, of the same burthen, were well known in the
trade.&nbsp; Among the smuggling craft belonging to Polperro, the
Unity was said to have made upwards of five hundred
entirely successful trips.
The story of Tom Potter is even yet told by oldsters at
Polperro, who, not themselves old enough to recollect the
circumstances, have it <span
class="pagenum">p. 140from their parents and
grandparents.&nbsp; Jonathan Couch tells the story, but he forgot
the exact year.
It seems, then, that one morning a lugger was observed by a
revenue cutter lying becalmed in Whitesand Bay.&nbsp; Through
their glasses the revenue men made it out to be the
Lottery, of Polperro, well known for her fast-sailing
qualities, as well as for the hardihood of her crew.&nbsp; With
the springing up of the breeze, there was little doubt but that
she would put to sea, and thus add yet another opportunity to the
many already existing for sneering at the stupidity of the local
preventive force.
Accordingly, the chief officer, with all despatch, manned two
or three boats and put off, before a breeze could spring up,
making sure of an easy capture.&nbsp; The smugglers, however,
observed these movements of their watchful enemies, and commenced
to make preparations for resistance, whereupon the revenue boats
opened fire; but it was not until they had approached closely
that the smugglers returned their volleys, and then the firing
grew very heavy, and when within a few yards of the expected
prize, Ambrose Bowden, who pulled bow-oar in one of the attacking
boats, fell mortally wounded.
It was plain that the Polperro men had come to a determination
not to surrender their fine craft, or the valuable cargo it
carried; and the commander of the revenue men thought it, under
the circumstances, the wisest thing to withdraw <a
name="page141">p. 141and to
allow the Lottery to proceed to sea, which she did, at the
earliest opportunity.&nbsp; But the names of those who formed the
crew were sufficiently well known to the authorities, and the
smugglers accordingly found themselves in a very difficult
position; not indeed on account of smuggling, but for the
resistance they had offered to authority, resulting in what was
technically murder.&nbsp; They all scattered and went into
hiding, and, secreted by friends, relatives, and sympathisers in
out-of-the-way places, long baffled the efforts of the revenue
officers, aided by searching parties of dragoons, to find
them.&nbsp; The authorities no sooner had learnt, on reliable
information, where they lay hidden, than they were found to have
been spirited away elsewhere.
But all this skulking about, with its enforced idleness and
waste of time, grew wearisome to the skulkers, and at length one
of the crew of the Lottery, Roger Toms by name, more weary
than his fellows of hiding, and perhaps also thinking that his
services would be handsomely rewarded, offered himself as
King&rsquo;s evidence.
According to his showing, it was a man named Tom Potter who
fired the shot that killed Bowden.&nbsp; The search then
concentrated upon Potter.&nbsp; The fury of Toms&rsquo;s
fellow-smugglers, and the entire population of Polperro, against
the informer, Toms, may readily be imagined.&nbsp; To in any way
aid these natural enemies of the people was of itself the
unforgiveable sin, and to further go and offer evidence that
would result in the forfeit <span
class="pagenum">p. 142of the life of one of his own
comrades disclosed an even deeper depth of infamy.
Toms was therefore obliged to go into hiding again, and, this
time, from his old associates.&nbsp; It was some considerable
time before they captured him, and they did it, even then, only
by stratagem.&nbsp; His wife, and others, knowing the intense
feeling aroused, not unnaturally supposed his life to be in
danger; but the smugglers assured her that they only wanted to
secure him and hold him prisoner until after the trial of Bowden,
and would not otherwise harm him.&nbsp; They added, mysteriously,
that things might go worse with Toms if he continued to hide
away; for they would be certain sooner or later to find
him.&nbsp; The greatly alarmed woman at last arranged that they
should capture him when accompanying her across the moors in the
direction of Polruan, and they accordingly seized the informer
when in her company, on Lantock Downs.&nbsp; They hid him for
awhile close by, and then smuggled him, a close prisoner, over to
that then noted smugglers&rsquo; Alsatia, Guernsey, with the idea
of eventually shipping him to America.&nbsp; But while at
Guernsey he escaped and made his way to London.
The evidence he gave was to the effect that, during the
firing, he went down into the cabin of the Lottery, and
there saw Potter with a gun.&nbsp; Potter said &ldquo;Damn
them!&nbsp; I have just done for one of them.&rdquo;
Potter was convicted and hanged.&nbsp; Toms, of course, never
dared to again return to Polperro, <span
class="pagenum">p. 143and was given a small post as
under-turnkey at Newgate, where he lived the remainder of his
life.
Talland, midway between Polperro and Looe, was a favourite
spot with these daring Polperro fellows.&nbsp; It offered better
opportunities than those given by Polperro itself for unobserved
landings; for it was&mdash;and it still is&mdash;a weird, lonely
place, overhanging the sea, with a solitary ancient church well
within sound of the waves that beat heavily upon the little
sands.&nbsp; It was an easy matter to store kegs in the
churchyard itself, and to take them inland, or into Polperro by
the country roads, when opportunity offered, hidden in carts
taking seaweed for manure to the fields.
At one time Talland owned a shuddery reputation in all this
country-side, and people in the farmhouses told, with many a
fearful glance over their shoulders, of the uncanny creatures
that nightly haunted the churchyard.&nbsp; Devils, wraiths, and
fearful apparitions made the spot a kind of satanic parliament;
and we may be amply sure that these horrid stories lost no accent
or detail of terror by constant repetition in those inglenooks on
winter evenings.&nbsp; This is not to say that other places round
about were innocent of things supernatural; for those were times
when every Cornish glen, moor, stream, and hill had their
bukkadhus, their piskies, and gnomes of sorts, good and evil; but
the infernal company that consorted together in Talland <a
name="page144">p. 144churchyard
was entirely beside these old-established creatures.&nbsp; They
were hors concours, as the French would say: they formed a
class by themselves; and, in the expressive slang of to-day, they
were &ldquo;the Limit,&rdquo; the ne plus ultra of
militant ghostdom.&nbsp; People rash enough to take the
church-path through Talland after night had fallen were sure to
hear and see strange semi-luminous figures; and they bethought
them then of the at once evil and beneficent reputation owned and
really enjoyed by Parson Dodge, the eccentric clergyman of
Talland, who was reputed an exorcist of the first quality.&nbsp;
He it was who, doughty wrestler with the most obstinate spectres,
found himself greatly in demand in a wide geographical area for
the banishing of troublesome ghosts for a long term of years to
the Red Sea; but it was whispered, on the other hand, that he
kept a numerous band of diabolic familiars believed by the simple
folk of that age to resort nightly to the vicarage for their
orders, and then to do his bidding.&nbsp; These were the spiteful
creatures, thought the country people, who, to revenge themselves
for this servitude, lurked in the churchyard, and got even with
mankind by pinching and smacking and playing all manner of scurvy
tricks upon those who dared pass this way under cover of
night.&nbsp; Uncle Zack Chowne even got a black eye by favour of
these inimical agencies, one exceptionally dark night when,
coming home-along this way, under the influence of spirits not of
supernatural origin, he met a <span
class="pagenum">p. 145posse of fiends, and, in the amiable
manner of the completely intoxicated, insisted upon their
adjourning with him to the nearest inn, &ldquo;jush for shake of
ole timesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, he made the sad mistake of
taking the fiends in question for friends, and addressed them by
name: with the result that he got a sledge-hammer blow in what
the prize-fighting brotherhood used to call &ldquo;the
peeper.&rdquo;




If he had adopted the proper method to be observed when
meeting spirits, i.e. if he had stood up and &ldquo;said
his Nummy Dummy,&rdquo; all would doubtless have been well; this
form of exorcism being in Cornwall of great repute and never
known to fail: being nothing less, indeed, than the Latin In
Nomine Domine in disguise.
But the real truth of the matter, as the readers of these
lines who can see further through a brick wall than others may
readily perceive, was that those savage spooks and mischievous,
Puck-like shapes, were really youthful local smugglers in
disguise, engaged at one and the same time in a highly profitable
nocturnal business, and in taking the welcome opportunity thus
offered in an otherwise dull circle of establishing a glorious
&ldquo;rag.&rdquo;
Parson Dodge himself was something more than suspected of
being &ldquo;ower sib&rdquo; to these at once commercial and
rollicking dogs, and Talland was in fact the scene of many a
successful run that could scarce have been successful had not
this easy-going cleric amiably permitted.
It is thus peculiarly appropriate that we find <a
name="page146">p. 146to-day in
this lonely churchyard an epitaph upon a smuggler of those
times.&nbsp; It is a tragical enough epitaph, its tragedy perhaps
disguised at the first glance by the grotesquely comic little
cherubs carved upon the tombstone, and representing the local
high-water mark of mortuary sculpture a hundred years or so
ago.&nbsp; They are pursy cherubs, of oleaginous appearance and
of this-worldly, rather than of other-worldly paunch and
deportment.&nbsp; In general, Talland churchyard is rich in such
carvings; death&rsquo;s-heads of appalling ugliness to be seen in
company with middle-aged, double-chinned angels wearing what look
suspiciously like chest-protectors and pyjamas, and they
decorate, with weirdly humorous aspect, the monuments and ledger
stones, and grin familiarly from the pavement with the
half-obliterated grins of many generations back.&nbsp; One of
them points with a claw, intended for a hand, to an object
somewhat resembling a crumpled dress-tie set up on end, probably
designed to represent an hour-glass.
Such is the mortuary art of these lonesome parishes in far
Cornwall: na&iuml;ve, uninstructed, home-made.&nbsp; It sufficed
the simple folk for whom it was wrought; and now that more
conventional and pretentious memorials have taken its place, to
serve the turn of folk less simple, there are those who would
abolish its uncouth manifestations.&nbsp; But that way&mdash;with
the urbanities of the world&mdash;goes old Cornwall, never to be
replaced.
p. 147Here
is the epitaph to the smuggler, one&mdash;
ROBERT MARK;
late of Polperro, who
Unfortunately
was shot at Sea the 24th day of Jany.
in the year of our Lord God
1802, in the 40th Year of His Age


&nbsp;
In prime of Life most suddenly,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sad tidings to relate;
Here view My utter destiny,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pity, My sad state:
I by a shot, which Rapid flew,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was instantly struck dead;
Lord pardon the Offender who
&nbsp;&nbsp; My precious blood did shed.
Grant Him to rest, and forgive Me,
&nbsp;&nbsp; All I have done amiss;
And that I may Rewarded be
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Everlasting Bliss.

Robert Mark was at the helm of a boat which had been obliged
to run before a revenue cutter.&nbsp; It was at the point of
escaping when the cutter&rsquo;s crew opened fire upon the
fugitive, killing the helmsman on the spot.&nbsp; Let us trust he
has duly won to that everlasting bliss that not even smugglers
are denied.&nbsp; The mild and forgiving terms of the epitaph are
to be noted with astonishment; the usual run of sentiment to be
observed on the very considerable number of these memorials to
smugglers cut off suddenly in the plenitude of their youth and
beauty, being particularly revengeful and bloodthirsty, or at the
best, bitterly reproachful.
Among these many epitaphs on smugglers <a
name="page148">p. 148to be met
with in the churchyards of seaboard parishes is the following, to
be found in the waterside parish of Mylor, near Falmouth.&nbsp;
Details of the incident in which this &ldquo;Cus-toms house
officer&rdquo; (spelled here exactly as the old lettering on the
tombstone has it) shot and mortally wounded Thomas James appear
to have been altogether lost:
We have not a moment we
can call our own.


&nbsp;
In Memory of Thomas James, aged 35 years, who<br
/>
on the evening of the 7th Dec. 1814, on his returning
to Flushing from St. Mawes in a boat was shot by a
Cus-toms house officer and expired a few days after.


&nbsp;
Officious zeal in luckless hour laid wait
And wilful sent the murderous ball of fate:
James to his home, which late in health he left,
Wounded returned&mdash;of life is soon bereft.

This is quite a mild and academic example, and obviously the
work of some passionless hireling, paid for his verses.&nbsp; He
would have written not less affectingly for poor dog Tray.
Prussia Cove, the most famous smuggling centre in Cornwall,
finds mention in another chapter.&nbsp; Little else remains to be
said, authentically at any rate.&nbsp; Invention, however, could
readily people every cove with desperate men and hair-raising
encounters, and there could nowadays be none who should be able
to deny the truth of them.&nbsp; But we will leave all that to
the novelists, merely pointing out that facts continually prove
themselves at least as strange as fiction.&nbsp; Thus at Wendron,
five miles inland from Helston, <span
class="pagenum">p. 149two caves, or underground chambers,
were discovered in 1905 during some alterations and rebuildings,
close to the churchyard.&nbsp; Local opinion declared them to be
smugglers&rsquo; hiding-holes.
There stands in St. Ives town a ruined old mansion in one of
the narrow alley-ways.&nbsp; It is known as Hicks&rsquo; Court,
and must have been a considerable place, in its day.&nbsp; Also
the owners of it must have been uncommonly fond of good liquors,
for it has a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; cellar, so called no doubt
because, like the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; drawers of bureaus, its
existence was perfectly obvious.&nbsp; Locally it is known as a
&ldquo;smugglers&rsquo; store.&rdquo;
In such a place as St. Ives, on a coast of old so notorious
for smuggling, we naturally look for much history in this sort,
but research fails to reward even the most diligent; and we have
to be content with the meagre suspicions (for they were nothing
more) of the honesty of John Knill, a famous native and resident
of the town in the second half of the eighteenth century, who was
Collector of Customs in that port, and in 1767 was chosen
Mayor.&nbsp; His action in equipping some small craft to serve as
privateers against smugglers was wilfully misconstrued; and, at
any rate, it does not seem at all fitting that he, as an official
of the customs service, should have been concerned in such
private ventures.&nbsp; These &ldquo;privateers,&rdquo; it was
said locally, were themselves actively employed in smuggling.
He was also, according to rumour, responsible, <a
name="page150">p. 150together
with one Praed, of Trevetho, for a ship which was driven ashore
in St. Ives Bay, and, when boarded by Roger Wearne, customs
officer, was found to be deserted by captain and crew, who had
been careful to remove all the ship&rsquo;s papers, so that her
owners remained unknown.&nbsp; The vessel was found to be full of
contraband goods, including a great quantity of china, some of it
of excellent quality.&nbsp; Wearne conceived the brilliant idea
of taking some samples of the best for his own personal use, and
filled out the baggy breeches he was wearing with them, before he
made to rejoin the boat that had put him aboard.&nbsp; This
uncovenanted cargo made his movements, as he came over the side,
so slow that one of his impatient boatmen smartly whacked him
with the flat of his oar, calling, &ldquo;Look sharp,
Wearne,&rdquo; and was dismayed when, in place of the thud that
might have been expected, there came a crash like the falling of
a trayful of crockery, followed by a cry of dismay and
anguish.

<span
class="smcap">Testimony to the Qualities of the Seafaring
Smugglers&mdash;Adam Smith on
Smuggling&mdash;A Clerical
Counterblast&mdash;Biographical
Sketches of Smugglers&mdash;Robert
Johnson, Harry
Paulet&mdash;William Gibson,
A Converted Smuggler
Care has already been taken to
discriminate between the hardy, hearty, and daring fellows who
brought their duty-free goods across the sea and those others
who, daring also, but often cruel and criminal, handled the goods
ashore.&nbsp; We now come to close quarters with the seafaring
smugglers, in a few biographical sketches: premising them with
some striking testimony to their qualities as seamen.
Captain Brenton, in his &ldquo;History of the Royal
Navy,&rdquo; pays a very high, but not extravagant, compliment to
these daring fellows: &ldquo;These men,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;are as remarkable for their skill in seamanship as for
their audacity in the hour of danger; their local knowledge has
been highly advantageous to the Navy, into which, however, they
never enter, unless sent on board ships of war as a punishment
for some crime p.
152committed against the revenue laws.&nbsp; They are
hardy, sober, and faithful to each other, beyond the generality
of seamen; and, when shipwreck occurs, have been known to perform
deeds not exceeded in any country in the world; probably
unequalled in the annals of other maritime powers.&rdquo;
Such men as these, besides being, in the rustic opinion, very
much of heroes, engaged in an unequal warfare, against heavy
odds, with a hateful, ogreish abstraction called &ldquo;the
Government,&rdquo; which existed only for the purpose of taxing
and suppressing the poor, for the benefit of the rich, were
regarded as benefactors; for they supplied the downtrodden,
overtaxed people with better articles, at lower prices, than
could be obtained in the legitimate way of traders who had paid
excise duties.
There was probably a considerable basis of truth to support
this view, for there is no doubt that duty-paid goods were
largely adulterated.&nbsp; To adulterate his spirits, his tea,
and his tobacco was the nearest road to any considerable profit
that the tradesman could then make.
Things being of this complexion, it would have been the
sheerest pedantry to refuse to purchase the goods the
free-traders supplied at such alluringly low prices, and of such
indubitably excellent quality; and to give retail publicans and
shopkeepers and private consumers their due, as sensible folk,
untroubled by supersensitive consciences, they rarely did
refuse.
p. 153Adam
Smith, in the course of his writings on political economy, nearly
a century and a half ago, stated the popular view about smuggling
and the purchase of smuggled goods:
&ldquo;To pretend to have any scruple about buying
smuggled goods, though a manifest encouragement to the violation
of the revenue laws, and to the perjury which almost always
attends it, would in most countries be regarded as one of those
pedantic pieces of hypocrisy which, instead of gaining credit
with anybody, seems only to expose the person who affects to
practise it to the suspicion of being a greater knave than most
of his neighbours.&rdquo;

From even the most charitable point of view, that person who
was so eccentric as to refuse to take advantage of any favourable
opportunity of purchasing cheaply such good stuff as might be
offered to him, and had not paid toll to the Revenue, was a
prig.
Smith himself looked upon the smuggler with a great deal of
sympathy, and regarded him as &ldquo;a person who, though no
doubt blamable for violating the laws of his country, is
frequently incapable of violating those of natural justice, and
would have been in every respect an excellent citizen had not the
laws of his country made that a crime which nature never meant to
be so.&rdquo;
Very few, indeed, were those voices raised against the
practice of smuggling.&nbsp; Among them, however, was that of
John Wesley, perhaps the <span
class="pagenum">p. 154most influential of all, especially
in the West of England.&nbsp; The clergy in general might rail
against the smugglers, but there were few among them who did not
enjoy the right sort of spirits which, singularly enough, could
only commonly be obtained from these shy sources; and there was a
certain malignant satisfaction to any properly constituted
smuggler in using the tower, or perhaps even the pulpit, of a
parish church as temporary spirit-cellar, and in undermining the
parson&rsquo;s honesty by the present of a tub.&nbsp; Few were
those reverend persons who repudiated this sly suggestion of
co-partnery, and those few who felt inclined so to do were
generally silenced by the worldly wisdom of their parish clerks,
who, forming as it were a connecting link between things sacred
and profane, could on occasion inform a clergyman that his most
respected churchwarden was financially interested in the success
of some famous run of goods just notoriously brought off.
Among those few clergy who actively disapproved of these
things we must include the Rev. Robert Hardy, somewhat
multitudinously beneficed in Sussex and elsewhere in the
beginning of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; He published in 1818 a
solemn pamphlet entitled: &ldquo;Serious Cautions and Advice to
all concerned in Smuggling; setting forth the Mischiefs attendant
upon that Traffic; together with some exhortations to Patience
and Contentment under the Difficulties and Trials of Life.&nbsp;
p. 155By
Robert Hardy, A.M., Vicar of the united parishes of Walberton and
Yapton, and of Stoughton, in Sussex; and Chaplain to H.R.H. the
Prince Regent.&rdquo;
The author did not by any means blink the difficulties or
dangers, but was, it will be conceded, far too sanguine when he
wrote the following passage, in the hope of his words suppressing
the trade:
&ldquo;The calamities with which the Smuggler is now
perpetually visited, by Informations and Fines, and Seizures, and
Imprisonments, will, I trust, if properly considered, prevail
upon the rich to discountenance, and upon the poor to forbear
from, a traffic which, in addition to the sin of it,
carries in its train so many evils, and mischiefs, and
sorrows.&rdquo;
His voice we may easily learn, in perusing the history of
smuggling at and after the date of his pamphlet, was as that of
one crying in the wilderness.&nbsp; Its sound may have pleased
himself, but it was absolutely wasted upon those who smuggled,
and those who purchased smuggled goods.
&ldquo;Smugglers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are of three
descriptions:
&ldquo;1.&nbsp; Those who employ their capital in the
trade;
&ldquo;2.&nbsp; Those who do the work;
&ldquo;3.&nbsp; Those who deal in Smuggled Articles, either as
Sellers or as Buyers.
&ldquo;All these are involved in the guilt of this
unlawful traffic; but its moral injuries fall principally
upon the second class.
p.
156&ldquo;Smuggling,&rdquo; he then proceeds to say,
&ldquo;has not been confined to the lower orders of people; but,
from what I have heard, I apprehend that it has very generally
been encouraged by their superiors, for whom no manner of excuse,
that I know of, can be offered.&nbsp; I was once asked by an
inhabitant of a village near the sea whether I thought there was
any harm in smuggling.&nbsp; Upon my replying that I not only
thought there was a great deal of harm in it, but a
great deal of sin, he exclaimed, &lsquo;Then the Lord have
mercy upon the county of Sussex, for who is there that has not
had a tub?&rsquo;&rdquo;
Among the ascertained careers of notable smugglers, that of
Thomas Johnson affords some exciting episodes.&nbsp; This worthy,
who appears to have been born in 1772 and to have died in 1839,
doubled the parts of smuggler and pilot.&nbsp; He was known
pretty generally as &ldquo;the famous Hampshire
smuggler.&rdquo;
As a captured and convicted smuggler he was imprisoned in the
New Prison in the Borough, in 1798, but made his escape, not
without suspicion of connivance on the part of the warders.&nbsp;
That the possession of him was ardently desired by the
authorities seems sufficiently evident by the fact of their
offering a reward of &pound;500 for his apprehension; but he
countered this by offering his services the following year as
pilot to the British forces sent to Holland.&nbsp; This offer was
duly accepted, and Johnson acquitted himself so greatly to the
satisfaction of p.
157Sir Ralph Abercromby, commanding, that he was fully
pardoned.




He then plunged into extravagant living, and finally found
himself involved in heavy debts, stated (but not altogether
credibly) to have totalled &pound;11,000.&nbsp; Resuming his old
occupation of smuggling, he was sufficiently wary not to be
captured again by the revenue officers; but what they found it
impossible to achieve was with little difficulty accomplished by
the bailiffs, who arrested him for debt and flung him into the
debtors&rsquo; prison of the Fleet, in 1802.&nbsp; Once there,
the Inland Revenue were upon him with smuggling charges, and the
situation seemed so black that he determined on again making a
venture for freedom.&nbsp; Waiting an exceptionally dark night,
he, on November 29th, stealthily crossed the yard and climbed the
tall enclosing wall that separated the prison from the outer
world.&nbsp; Sitting on the summit of this wall, he let himself
down slowly by the full length of his arms, just over the place
where a lamp was bracketed out over the pathway, far
beneath.&nbsp; He then let himself drop so that he would fall on
to the bracket, which he calculated would admirably break the too
deep drop from the summit of the wall to the ground.&nbsp;
Unfortunately for him, an unexpected piece of projecting ironwork
caught him and ripped up the entire length of his thigh.&nbsp; At
that moment the slowly approaching footsteps of the watchman were
heard, and Johnson, with agonised apprehension, saw him coming
along, swinging his lantern.&nbsp; <span
class="pagenum">p. 158There was nothing for it but to lie
along the bracket, bleeding profusely the while, until the
watchman should have passed.
He did so, and, as soon as seemed safe, dropped to the ground
and crawled to a hackney-coach, hired by his friends, that had
been waiting that night and several nights earlier, near by.
Safely away from the neighbourhood of the prison, his friends
procured him a post-chaise and four; and thus he travelled
post-haste to the Sussex coast at Brighton.&nbsp; On the beach a
small sailing-vessel was waiting to convey him across
Channel.&nbsp; He landed at Calais and thence made for Flushing,
where he was promptly flung into prison by the agents of
Napoleon, who was at that time seriously menacing our shores with
invasion from Boulogne, where his flotilla for the transport of
troops then lay.
Johnson and others were, in the opening years of the
nineteenth century, very busily employed in smuggling gold out of
the country into France.&nbsp; Ever since the troubles of the
Revolution in that country, and all through the wars that had
been waged with the rise of Napoleon, gold had been
dwindling.&nbsp; People, terrified at the unrest of the times,
and nervous of fresh troubles to come, secreted coin, and
consequently the premium on gold rose to an extraordinary height,
not only on the Continent but in England as well.&nbsp; A guinea
would then fetch as much as twenty-seven shillings, and was worth
a good deal more on the other side of the Channel.&nbsp;
Patriotism was not proof against <span
class="pagenum">p. 159the prospects of profits to be
earned by the export of gold, and not a few otherwise respectable
banking-houses embarked in the trade.&nbsp; Finance has no
conscience.




It is obvious that only thoroughly dependable and responsible
men could be employed on this business, for shipments of gold
varied from &pound;20,000 to &pound;50,000.
Eight and ten-oared galleys were as a rule used for the
traffic; the money slung in long leather purses around the
oarsmen&rsquo;s bodies.
Napoleon is said to have offered Johnson a very large reward
if he would consent, as pilot, to aid his scheme of invasion, and
we are told that Johnson hotly refused.
&ldquo;I am a smuggler,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but a true
lover of my country, and no traitor.&rdquo;
Napoleon was no sportsman.&nbsp; He kept Johnson closely
confined in a noisome dungeon for nine months.&nbsp; How much
longer he proposed to hold him does not appear, for the smuggler,
long watching a suitable opportunity, at last broke away, and,
ignorant that a pardon was awaiting him in England, escaped to
America.
Returning from that &ldquo;land of the brave and the
free,&rdquo; we find him in 1806 with the fleet commanded by Lord
St. Vincent, off Brest.&nbsp; Precisely what services, beside the
obvious one of acting as pilot, he was then rendering our Navy
cannot be said, for the materials toward a life of this somewhat
heroic and picturesque figure are very scanty.&nbsp; But that he
had some plan for the <span
class="pagenum">p. 160destruction of the French fleet
seems obvious from the correspondence of Lord St. Vincent, who,
writing on August 8th, 1806, to Viscount Howick, remarks,
&ldquo;The vigilance of the enemy alone prevented Tom Johnstone
[sic] from doing what he professed.&rdquo;&nbsp; What he
professed is, unfortunately, hidden from us.
After this mysterious incident we lose sight for a while of
our evasive hero, and may readily enough assume that he returned
again to his smuggling enterprises; for it is on record that in
1809, when the unhappy Walcheren expedition was about to be
despatched, at enormous cost, from England to the malarial shores
of Holland, he once more offered his services as pilot, and they
were again accepted, with the promise of another pardon for
lately-accrued offences.
He duly piloted the expedition, to the entire satisfaction of
the Government, and received his pardon and a pension of
&pound;100 a year.&nbsp; He fully deserved both, for he signally
distinguished himself in the course of the operations by swimming
to the ramparts of a fort, with a rope, by which in some
unexplained manner a tremendous and disastrous explosion was
effected.
He was further appointed to the command of the revenue cruiser
Fox, at the conclusion of the war, and thus set to prey
upon his ancient allies; who, in their turn, made things so
uncomfortable for the &ldquo;scurvy rat,&rdquo; as they were
pleased picturesquely to style him, that he rarely dared venture
out of port.&nbsp; So it would appear that he <a
name="page161">p. 161did not for
any great length of time hold that command.
But the reputation for daring and resourcefulness that he
enjoyed did not seem to be clouded by this incident, for he was
approached by the powerful friends of Napoleon, exiled at St.
Helena, to aid them in a desperate attempt to rescue the fallen
Emperor.&nbsp; It was said that they offered him the sum of
&pound;40,000 down, and a further very large sum, if the attempt
were successful.&nbsp; The patriotic hero of some years earlier
seems to have been successfully tempted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every
man,&rdquo; says the cynic, &ldquo;has his price&rdquo;; and
&pound;40,000 and a generous refresher formed his.&nbsp; For
personal gain he was prepared to let loose once more the scourge
of Europe.
Plans were actively afoot for the construction of a submarine
boat (there is nothing new under the sun!) for the purpose of
secretly conveying the distinguished exile away, when he
inconsiderately died; and thus vanished Johnson&rsquo;s dreams of
wealth.
Some years later Johnson built a submarine boat to the order
of the Spanish Government, and ran trials with it in the Thames,
between London Bridge and Blackwall.&nbsp; On one occasion it
became entangled in a cable of one of the vessels lying in the
Pool, and for a time it seemed scarce possible the boat could
easily be freed.
&ldquo;We have but two and a half minutes to live,&rdquo; said
he, consulting his watch calmly, &ldquo;unless we get clear of
that cable.&rdquo;
p.
162&ldquo;Captain&rdquo; Johnson, as he was generally
styled, lived in quiet for many years, finally dying at the age
of sixty-seven, in March 1839, in the unromantic surroundings of
the Vauxhall Bridge Road.
Another smuggler of considerable reputation, of whom, however,
we know all too little, was Harry Paulet.&nbsp; This person, who
appears in some manner to have become a prisoner aboard a French
man-o&rsquo;-war, made his escape and took with him a bag of the
enemy&rsquo;s despatches, which he handed over to the English
naval authorities.
A greater deed was that when, sailing with a cargo of smuggled
brandy, he came in view of the French fleet (we being then, as
usual, at war with France), Paulet immediately went on a new tack
and carried the news of the enemy&rsquo;s whereabouts to Lord
Hawke, who promised to hang him if the news were not true.
A somewhat interesting and curious account of the conversion
of a youthful smuggler may be found in an old volume of The
Bible Christian Magazine.&nbsp; The incident belongs to the
Scilly Isles.
William Gibson, the smuggler in question, was a bold, daring
young man, and he, with others, had crossed over to France more
than once in a small open boat, a distance of 150 miles, rowing
there and back, running great risks to bring home a cargo of
brandy.
In 1820, the time when William was at his best in these
smuggling enterprises, St. Mary&rsquo;s was visited by a pious,
simple-minded young woman, <span
class="pagenum">p. 163Mary Ann Werry by name, the first
representative of the Bible Christian connexion to land on the
island.&nbsp; The congregation were in the throes of a revival,
and eager for more and more preaching, but the minister upon whom
they principally relied was commercially minded, and demanded
&pound;2 for his services.&nbsp; The members refused to give
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a woman here,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;we will have her to preach to us&rdquo;; and, being asked,
she consented, and preached from 1 Tim. iv. 8, &ldquo;For bodily
exercise profiteth little; but godliness is profitable unto all
things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which
is to come.&rdquo;
We have the well-known ruling of Dr. Johnson upon the
preaching of women, that it in a manner resembles a dog walking
on its hind-legs: it is not done well; you only marvel that it is
done at all.&nbsp; [N.B.&mdash;Dr. Johnson would not have
favoured, or been favoured by, modern Women&rsquo;s
Leagues.]&nbsp; But, at any rate, Miss Werry seems to have been a
notable exception.&nbsp; She was eloquent and persuasive, and
played upon the sensibilities of those rugged Scillonians what
tune she would.
Tears of penitence rolled down the cheeks of many a stalwart
man (to say nothing of the hoary sinners) that day.&nbsp; Among
the number thus affected was William Gibson, of St.
Martin&rsquo;s, who from that hour became a changed person.&nbsp;
No longer did he refuse to render unto C&aelig;sar (otherwise
King George) that which was C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s (or King
George&rsquo;s).&nbsp; He gave up the contraband <a
name="page164">p. 164trade, and,
forswearing his old companions&rsquo; ways, turned to those of
the righteous and the law-abiding, and became a burning and a
shining light, and, as &ldquo;Brother Gibson,&rdquo; a painful
preacher in the Bible Christian communion.&nbsp; And thus, and in
lawful fishing, with some little piloting, he continued
steadfast, until his death in 1877, in his eighty-third year.

165CHAPTER XII
<span
class="smcap">The Carter Family, of
Prussia Cove
In the west of Cornwall, on the
south coast of the narrow neck of land which forms the beginning
of that final westerly region known as
&ldquo;Penwithstart,&rdquo; is situated Prussia Cove, originally
named Porth Leah, or King&rsquo;s Cove.&nbsp; It lies just
eastwardly of the low dark promontory known as Cuddan Point, and
is even at this day a secluded place, lying remote from the dull
high-road that runs between Helston, Marazion, and
Penzance.&nbsp; In the days of the smugglers Porth Leah, or
Prussia Cove, was something more than secluded, and those who had
any business at all with the place came to it much more easily by
sea than by land.&nbsp; This disability was, however, not so
serious as at first sight it would seem to be, for the
inhabitants of Prussia Cove were few, and were all, without
exception, fishermen and smugglers, who were much more at home
upon the sea than on land, and desired nothing so little as good
roads and easy communication with the world.&nbsp; An interesting
and authoritative sidelight upon the then condition of this
district of West Cornwall is afforded by The Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine of 1754, in which the <span
class="pagenum">p. 166entire absence of roads of any kind
is commented upon.&nbsp; Bridle-paths there were, worn doubtless
in the first instance by the remote original inhabitants of this
region, trodden by the Phoenician traders of hoary antiquity, and
unaltered in all the intervening ages.&nbsp; They then remained,
says The Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine, &ldquo;as the Deluge
left them, and dangerous to travel over.&rdquo;&nbsp; That time
of writing was the era when these conditions were coming to an
end, for the road from Penryn to Marazion was shortly afterwards
constructed, much to the alarm and disgust of the people of West
Cornwall in general, and of those of Penzance in
particular.&nbsp; Penzance required no roads, and in 1760 its
Corporation petitioned, but unsuccessfully, against the extension
of the turnpike road then proposed, from Marazion.&nbsp; That was
the time when there was but one cart in the town, and when
wheeled traffic was impossible outside it: pack-horses and the
sledge-like contrivances known as &ldquo;truckamucks&rdquo; being
the only methods of conveying such few goods as were
required.
Under these interesting social conditions the ancient
semi-independence of Western Cornwall remained, little
impaired.&nbsp; Many still spoke the older Cornish language; the
majority of folk referred to Devonshire and the country in
general beyond the Tamar as &ldquo;England&rdquo;&mdash;the
inference being, of course, that Cornwall itself was not
England&mdash;and smuggling was as usual an industry as tin and
copper-mining, fishing, or farming.&nbsp; Indeed the distances in
Western p.
167Cornwall between sea and sea are so narrow that any man
was commonly as excellent at farming as he was at fishing, and as
expert at smuggling as at either of those more legitimate
occupations.&nbsp; This amphibious race, wholly Celtic,
adventurous, and enthusiastic, was not readily amenable to the
restrictions upon trade imposed by that shadowy, distant, and
impersonal abstraction called &ldquo;the Government,&rdquo;
supported by visible forces, in the way of occasional soldiers or
infrequent revenue cruisers, wherewith to make the collectors of
customs at Penzance, Falmouth, or St. Ives, respected.
&ldquo;The coasts here swarm with smugglers,&rdquo; wrote
George Borlase, of Penzance, agent to Lieut.-General Onslow, in
1750.&nbsp; Many letters by the same hand, printed in the
publications of the Royal Institution of Cornwall, under the
title of the &ldquo;Lanisley Letters,&rdquo; reiterate this
statement, the writer of them urging the establishment of a
military force at Helston, for &ldquo;just on that neighbourhood
lye the smugglers and wreckers, more than about us (at Penzance),
tho&rsquo; there are too many in all parts of the
country.&rdquo;
The Cornish of that time were an unregenerate race, in the
fullest sense of that term, and indulged in all the evil excesses
to which the Celtic nature, untouched by religion, and wallowing
in ancient superstitions, is prone.&nbsp; They drank to excess,
fought brutally, and were shameless wreckers, who did not
hesitate to lure ships upon the rocks and so bring about their
destruction and p.
168incidentally their own enrichment by the cargo and
other valuables washed ashore.&nbsp; Murder was a not unusual
corollary of the wreckers&rsquo; fearful trade, partly because of
the olden superstition that, if you saved the life of a castaway,
that person whom you had preserved would afterwards bring about
your own destruction.&nbsp; Therefore it was merely the instinct
of self-preservation, and not sheer ferocity, that prompted the
knocking on the head of such waifs and strays.&nbsp; If, at the
same time, the wrecker went over the pockets of the deceased, or
cut off his or her fingers, for the sake of any rings, that must
not, of course, be accounted mere vulgar robbery: it was simply
the frugal nature of the people, unwilling to waste anything.
Upon these simple children of nature, imbued with many of the
fearful beliefs current among the savages of the South Sea
islands, the Reverend John Wesley descended, in 1743.&nbsp; They
were then, he says, a people &ldquo;who neither feared God nor
regarded man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet, so impressionable is the Celtic
nature, so childlike and easily led for good or for evil, that
his preaching within a marvellously short space of time entirely
changed the habits of these folk.&nbsp; In every village and
hamlet there sprang up, as by magic, Wesleyan Methodist
meeting-houses; and these and other chapels of dissent from the
Church of England are to this day the most outstanding features
of the Cornish landscape.&nbsp; They are, architecturally
speaking, without exception, hideous eyesores, but morally <a
name="page169">p. 169they are
things of beauty.&nbsp; It is one of the bitterest indictments
possible to be framed against the Church of England in the west
that, in all its existence, it has never commanded the
affections, nor exercised the spiritual influence, won by Wesley
in a few short years.




It was about this period of Wesley&rsquo;s first visits to
Cornwall that the Carter family of Prussia Cove were born.&nbsp;
Their father, Francis Carter, who was a miner, and had, in
addition, a small farm at Pengersick, traditionally came of a
Shropshire family, and died in 1784.&nbsp; He had eight sons and
two daughters, John Carter, the &ldquo;King of Prussia,&rdquo;
being the eldest.&nbsp; Among the others, Francis, born 1745,
Henry, born 1749, and Charles, 1757, were also actively engaged
in smuggling; but John, both in respect of being the eldest, and
by force of character, was chief of them.&nbsp; He and his
brethren were all, to outward seeming, small farmers and
fisherfolk, tilling the ungrateful land in the neighbourhood of
Porth Leah, but in reality busily employed in bringing over
cargoes of spirits from Roscoff, Cherbourg, and St. Malo.&nbsp;
The origin of the nickname, &ldquo;King of Prussia,&rdquo; borne
by John Carter, is said to lie in the boyish games of the
&ldquo;king of the castle&rdquo; kind, of himself and his
brothers, in which he was always the &ldquo;King of
Prussia&rdquo;&mdash;i.e. Frederick the Great, the popular
hero of that age.&nbsp; Overlooking the cove of Porth Leah, at
that time still bearing that name, he built about 1770 a large
and substantial stone house, which stood <a
name="page170">p. 170a prominent
feature in the scene, until it was demolished in 1906.&nbsp; This
he appears to have kept partly as an inn, licensed or unlicensed,
which became known by his own nickname, the &ldquo;King of
Prussia,&rdquo; and in it he lived until 1807.
&ldquo;Prussia Cove&rdquo; is, in fact, two coves, formed by
the interposition of a rocky ledge, at whose extremity is a
rock-islet called the &ldquo;Eneys&rdquo;&mdash;i.e.
&ldquo;ynys,&rdquo; ancient Cornish for island.&nbsp; The western
portion of these inlets is &ldquo;Bessie&rsquo;s Cove,&rdquo;
which takes its name from one Bessie Burrow, who kept an inn on
the cliff-top, known as the &ldquo;Kidleywink.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
easterly inlet was the site of the &ldquo;King of
Prussia&rsquo;s&rdquo; house.&nbsp; Both these rocky channels had
the advantage of being tucked away by nature in recesses of the
coast, and so overhung by the low cliffs that no stranger could
in the least perceive what harboured there until he was actually
come to the cliff&rsquo;s edge, and peering over them; while no
passing vessel out in the Channel could detect the presence of
any craft, which could not be located from the sea until the cove
itself was approached.
Thus snugly seated, the Carter family throve.&nbsp; Of John
Carter, although chief of the clan, we have few details, always
excepting the one great incident of his career; and of that the
account is but meagre.&nbsp; It seems that he had actually been
impudent enough to construct a battery, mounted with some small
cannon, beside his house, and had the temerity to unmask it and
open fire upon the Fairy revenue sloop, which one day
chased a p.
171smuggling craft into this lair, and had sent in a boat
party.&nbsp; The boat withdrew before this unexpected reception,
and, notice having been sent round to Penzance, a party of
mounted soldiers appeared the following morning and let loose
their muskets upon the smugglers, who were still holding the
fort, but soon vacated it upon thus being taken in the rear,
retreating to the &ldquo;Kidleywink.&rdquo;&nbsp; What would next
have happened had the soldiers pursued their advantage we can
only surmise; but they appear to have been content with this
demonstration, and to have returned whence they came, while of
the revenue sloop we hear no more.&nbsp; Nor does Carter ever
appear to have been called to account for his defiance.&nbsp; But
if a guess may be hazarded where information does not exist, it
may be assumed that Carter&rsquo;s line of defence would be that
his fort was constructed and armed against French raids, and that
he mistook the revenue vessel for a foreign privateer.




John Carter, and indeed all his brothers with him, was highly
respected, as the following story will show.&nbsp; The excise
officers of Penzance, hearing on one occasion that he was away
from home, descended upon the cove with a party, and searched the
place.&nbsp; They found a quantity of spirits lately landed, and,
securing all the kegs, carried them off to Penzance and duly
locked them up in the custom-house.&nbsp; The anger of the
&ldquo;King of Prussia&rdquo; upon his return was great; not so
great, it seems, on account of the actual loss <a
name="page172">p. 172of the
goods as for the breaking of faith with his customers it
involved.&nbsp; The spirits had been ordered by some of the
gentlefolk around, and a good deal of them had been paid
for.&nbsp; Should he be disgraced by failing to keep his
engagements as an honest tradesman?&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; And so he
and his set off to Penzance overnight, and, raiding the
custom-house, brought away all his tubs, from among a number of
others.&nbsp; When morning came, and the custom-house was
unlocked, the excisemen knew whose handiwork this had been,
because Carter was such an honourable man, and none other than
himself would have been so scrupulous as to take back only his
own.&nbsp; Yet he was also the hero of the next incident.&nbsp;
The revenue officers once paid him a surprise visit, and
overhauled his outhouses, in search of contraband.&nbsp; The
search, on this occasion, was fruitless.&nbsp; But there yet
remained one other shed, and this, suspiciously enough, was
locked.&nbsp; He refused to hand over the key, whereupon the door
was burst open, revealing only domestic articles.&nbsp; The
broken door remained open throughout the night, and by morning
all the contents of the shed had vanished.&nbsp; Carter
successfully sued for the value of the property he had
&ldquo;lost,&rdquo; but he had removed it himself!
We learn something of the Carter family business from the
autobiography written by Henry Carter, an account of his life
from 1749 until 1795.&nbsp; Much else is found in a memoir
printed in The Wesleyan Methodist Magazine, 1831.&nbsp; <a
name="page173">p.
173&ldquo;Captain Harry&rdquo; lived until 1829, farming
in a small way at the neighbouring hamlet of Rinsey.&nbsp; He had
long relinquished smuggling, having been converted in 1789, and
living as a burning and a shining light in the Wesleyan communion
thereafter, preaching with fervour and unction.&nbsp; He tells
us, in his rough, unvarnished autobiography <a
name="citation173"><a href="#footnote173"
class="citation">[173] that he first went smuggling and
fishing with his brothers when seventeen years of age, having
already worked in the mines.&nbsp; At twenty-five years of age he
went regularly smuggling in a ten-ton sloop, with two men to help
him; and was so successful that he soon had a sloop, nearly twice
as large, especially built for him.&nbsp; Successful again,
&ldquo;rather beyond common,&rdquo; he (or &ldquo;we,&rdquo; as
he says) bought a cutter of some thirty tons, and employed a crew
of ten men.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saild in her one year, and I suppose
made more safe voyages than have been ever made, since or before,
with any single person.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this while, he tells us,
he was under conviction of sin, but went on, nevertheless, for
years, sinning and repenting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he
continues, &ldquo;in the cource of these few years, as we card a
large trade with other vessels allso, we gained a large sum of
money, and being a speculating family, was not satisfied with
small things.&rdquo;&nbsp; A new cutter was accordingly built, of
about sixty tons burthen, and Captain Harry took her to sea in
December 1777.&nbsp; Putting <span
class="pagenum">p. 174into St. Malo, to repair a sprung
bowsprit, his fine new cutter, with its sixteen guns, was taken
by the French, and himself and his crew of thirty-six men flung
into prison, difficulties having again sprung up between England
and France, and an embargo being laid upon all English shipping
in French ports.&nbsp; In prison he was presently joined by his
brother John; both being shortly afterwards sent on parole to
Josselin.&nbsp; In November 1779 they were liberated, in exchange
for two French gentlemen, prisoners of war.&nbsp; The family,
Captain Harry remarks, they found alive and well on their return
home after this two years&rsquo; absence, but in a low state, the
&ldquo;business&rdquo; not having been managed well in their
enforced absence.
It is impossible to resist the strong suspicion, in all this
and other talk in the autobiography, of buying and building newer
and larger vessels, that the Carters were financed by some
wealthy and influential person, or persons, as undoubtedly many
smugglers were, the profits of the smuggling trade, when
conducted on a large scale and attended by a run of luck, being
very large and amply recouping the partners for the incidental
losses.&nbsp; But the loss of the fine new cutter, on her first
voyage, at St. Malo, must have been a very serious business.
After another interval of success with the smaller cutter they
had earlier used, with spells ashore, &ldquo;riding about the
country getting freights, collecting money for the company, etc.,
etc.,&rdquo; p.
175another fifty-ton cutter was purchased, mounting
nineteen guns.&nbsp; That venture, too, was highly successful,
and &ldquo;the company accordingly had a new lugger built,
mounting twenty guns.&rdquo;&nbsp; Horrible to relate, Captain
Harry, &ldquo;being exposed to more company and sailors of all
descriptions, larned to swear at times.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is bad
hearing.




Obviously in those times there was a good deal of give and
take going on between the Customs and those smugglers who
smuggled on a large scale, and the Carters&rsquo; vessels must in
some unofficial way have ranked as privateers.&nbsp; Hence,
possibly, the considerable armament they carried.&nbsp; The
Customs, and the Admiralty too, were prepared to wink at
smuggling when services against the foreign foe could be
invoked.&nbsp; Thus we find Captain Harry, in his autobiography,
narrating how the Collector of Customs at Penzance sent him a
message to the effect that the Black Prince privateer,
from Dunkirk, was off the coast, near St. Ives, and desiring him
to pursue her.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was not,&rdquo; frankly says
Captain Harry, &ldquo;a very agreeable business&rdquo;; but,
being afraid of offending the Collector, he obeyed, and went in
pursuit, with two vessels.&nbsp; Coming up with the enemy, after
a running fight of three or four hours, the lugger received a
shot that obliged her to bear up, in a sinking condition; and so
her consort stood by her, and the chase was of necessity
abandoned.&nbsp; Presently the lugger sank, fourteen of her crew
of thirty-one being drowned.
p. 176In
January 1788 he went with a cargo of contraband in a
forty-five-ton lugger to Cawsand Bay, near Plymouth, and there
met with the most serious reverse of his smuggling career, two
man-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s boats boarding the vessel and seizing it
and its contents.&nbsp; He was so knocked about over the head
with cutlasses that he was felled to the deck, and left there for
dead.
&ldquo;I suppose I might have been there aboute a quarter of
an hour, until they had secured my people below, and after found
me lying on the deck.&nbsp; One of them said, &lsquo;Here is one
of the poor fellows dead.&rsquo;&nbsp; Another made answer,
&lsquo;Put the man below.&rsquo;&nbsp; He answered again, saying,
&lsquo;What use is it to put a dead man below?&rsquo; and so past
on.&nbsp; Aboute this time the vessel struck aground, the wind
being about east-south-east, very hard, right on the shore.&nbsp;
So their I laid very quiet for near the space of two hours,
hearing their discourse as they walked by me, the night being
very dark on the 30 Jany. 1788.&nbsp; When some of them saw me
lying there, said, &lsquo;Here lays one of the fellows
dead,&rsquo; one of them answered as before, &lsquo;Put him
below.&rsquo;&nbsp; Another said, &lsquo;The man is
dead.&rsquo;&nbsp; The commanding officer gave orders for a
lantern and candle to be brought, so they took up one of my legs,
as I was lying upon my belly; he let it go, and it fell as dead
down on the deck.&nbsp; He likewayse put his hand up under my
clothes, between my shirt and my skin, and then examined my head,
saying, &lsquo;This man is so warm now as he was two hours <a
name="page177">p. 177back, but
his head is all to atoms.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have thought hundreds of
times since what a miracle it was I neither sneezed, coughed, nor
drew breath that they perceived in all this time, I suppose not
less than ten or fifteen minutes.&nbsp; The water being ebbing,
the vessel making a great heel towards the shore, so that in the
course of a very little time after, as their two boats were made
fast alongside, one of them broke adrift.&nbsp; Immediately there
was orders given to man the other boat, in order to fetch her; so
that when I saw them in the state of confusion, their gard
broken, I thought it was my time to make my escape; so I crept on
my belly on the deck, and got over a large raft just before the
mainmast, close by one of the men&rsquo;s heels, as he was
standing there handing the trysail.&nbsp; When I got over the
lee-side I thought I should be able to swim on shore in a stroke
or two.&nbsp; I took hold of the burtons of the mast, and, as I
was lifting myself over the side, I was taken with the cramp in
one of my thighs.&nbsp; So then I thought I should be drowned,
but still willing to risk it, so that I let myself over the side
very easily by a rope into the water, fearing my enemies would
hear me, and then let go.&nbsp; As I was very near the shore, I
thought to swim on shore in the course of a stroke or two, as I
used to swim so well, but soon found out my mistake.&nbsp; I was
sinking almost like a stone, and hauling astarn in deeper water,
when I gave up all hopes of life, and began to swallow some
water.&nbsp; I found a rope <span
class="pagenum">p. 178under my breast, so that I had not
lost all my senses.&nbsp; I hauled upon it, and soon found one
end fast to the side, just where I went overboard, which gave me
a little hope of life.&nbsp; So that when I got there, could not
tell which was best, to call to the man-of-war&rsquo;s men to
take me in, or to stay there and die, for my life and strength
were allmoste exhausted; but whilst I was thinking of this,
touched bottom with my feet.&nbsp; Hope then sprung up, and I
soon found another rope, leading towards the head of the vessel
in shoaler water, so that I veered upon one and hauled upon the
other that brought me under the bowsprit, and then at times upon
the send of the sea, my feete were allmoste dry.&nbsp; I thought
then I would soon be out of their way.&nbsp; Left go the rope,
but as soon as I attempted to run, fell down, and as I fell,
looking round aboute me, saw three men standing close by
me.&nbsp; I knew they were the man-of-war&rsquo;s men seeing for
the boat, so I lyed there quiet for some little time, and then
creeped upon my belly I suppose aboute the distance of fifty
yards; and as the ground was scuddy, some flat rock mixt with
channels of sand, I saw before me a channel of white sand, and
for fear to be seen creeping over it, which would take some time,
not knowing there was anything the matter with me, made the
second attempt to run, and fell in the same manner as
before.&nbsp; My brother Charles being there, looking out for the
vessel, desired some Cawsand men to go down to see if they could
p. 179pick up
any of the men, dead or alive, not expecting to see me ever any
more, allmoste sure I was ither shot or drowned.&nbsp; One of
them saw me fall, ran to my assistance, and, taking hold of me
under the arm, says, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;&nbsp; So as I
thought him to be an enemy, made no answer.&nbsp; He said,
&lsquo;Fear not, I am a friend; come with me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And by
that time, forth was two more come, which took me under both
arms, and the other pushed me in the back, and so dragged me up
to the town.&nbsp; I suppose it might have been about the
distance of the fifth part of a mile.&nbsp; My strength was
allmoste exhausted; my breath, nay, my life, was allmoste
gone.&nbsp; They took me into a room where there were seven or
eight of Cawsand men and my brother Charles, and when he saw me,
knew me by my great coat, and cryed with joy, &lsquo;This is my
brother!&rsquo;&nbsp; So then they immediately slipt off my wet
clothes, and one of them pulled off his shirt from off him and
put on me, sent for a doctor, and put me to bed.&nbsp; Well,
then, I have thought many a time since what a wonder it
was.&nbsp; The bone of my nose cut right in two, nothing but a
bit of skin holding it, and two very large cuts on my head, that
two or three pieces of my skull worked out afterwards.&rdquo;
The difficulty before Captain Harry&rsquo;s friends was how to
hide him away, for they were convinced that a reward would be
offered for his apprehension.&nbsp; He was, in the first
instance, taken to the house of his brother Charles, and stayed
p. 180there
six or seven days, until an advertisement appeared in the
newspapers, offering a reward of three hundred pounds for him,
within three months.&nbsp; He was then taken to the house of a
gentleman at Marazion, and there remained close upon three weeks,
removing thence to the mansion called Acton Castle, near Cuddan
Point, then quite newly built by one Mr. John Stackhouse.&nbsp;
He was moved to and fro, between Acton Castle and Marazion, and
so great did his brothers think the need of precaution that the
doctor who attended to his hurts was blindfolded on the
way.&nbsp; And so matters progressed until October, when he was
shipped from Mount&rsquo;s Bay to Leghorn, and thence, in 1789,
sailed for New York.&nbsp; It was in New York that the Lord
strove mightily with him, and he was converted and became a
member of the Wesleyan Methodist communion.&nbsp; After some
considerable trials, he sailed for England, and finally reached
home again in October 1790, to his brother Charles&rsquo;s house
at Kenneggey.&nbsp; His reception was enthusiastic, and he became
in great request as a preacher in all that countryside.&nbsp; But
in April 1791 he tells us he was sent for &ldquo;by a great man
of this neighbourhood&rdquo; (probably one of those whom we have
already suspected of being sleeping-partners in the
Carters&rsquo; business), and warned that three gentlemen had
been in his company one day at Helston, when one said, looking
out of window, &ldquo;There goes a Methodist preacher&rdquo;;
whereupon another answered, &ldquo;I wonder how Harry Carter goes
p. 181about so
publicly, preaching, and the law against him.&nbsp; I wonder he
is not apprehended.&rdquo;&nbsp; The great man warned him that it
might be a wise course to return to America.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continues Captain Harry, &ldquo;as the gent
was well acquainted with our family, I dined with him, and he
brought me about a mile in my way home; so I parted with him,
fully determining in my own mind to soon see my dear friends in
New York again.&nbsp; So I told my brothers what the news was,
and that I was meaning to take the gent&rsquo;s advice.&nbsp;
They answered, &lsquo;If you go to America, we never shall see
you no more.&nbsp; We are meaning to car on a little trade in
Roscoff, in the brandy and gin way, and if you go there
you&rsquo;ll be as safe there as in America; likewayse we shal
pay you for your comision, and you car on a little business for
yourself, if you please.&rsquo;&nbsp; So,&rdquo; continues this
simple soul, &ldquo;with prayer and supplication I made my
request known unto God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as there appeared no
divine interdict upon smuggling, he accepted the agency and went
to reside at Roscoff, sending over many a consignment of ardent
liquors that were never intended to&mdash;and never did&mdash;pay
tribute to the Revenue.&nbsp; All went well until, in the
troubles that attended the French Revolution, he was, in company
with other English, arrested and flung into prison in 1793.&nbsp;
And in prison he remained during that Reign of Terror in which
English prisoners were declared by the Convention to rank with
the &ldquo;aristocrats&rdquo; and the &ldquo;suspects,&rdquo; and
were p.
182therefore in hourly danger of the guillotine.&nbsp;
This immediate terror passed when Robespierre was executed, July
28th, 1794, but it was not until August 1795 that Harry Carter
was released.&nbsp; He reached home on August 22nd, and appears
ever after to have settled down to tilling a modest farm and
leaving smuggling to brothers John and Charles.

183CHAPTER XIII
<span
class="smcap">Jack Rattenbury
We do not expect of smugglers that
they should be either literary or devout.&nbsp; The doings of the
Hawkhurst Gang, and of other desperate and bloody-minded
associations of free-traders, seem more in key with the business
than either the sitting at a desk, nibbling a pen and rolling a
frenzied eye, in search of a telling phrase, or the singing of
Methodist psalms.&nbsp; Yet we have, in the &ldquo;Memoirs of a
Smuggler,&rdquo; published at Sidmouth in 1837, the career of
Jack Rattenbury, smuggler, of Beer, in Devonshire, told by
himself; and in the diary of Henry Carter, of Prussia Cove, and
later of Rinsey, we have learned how he found peace and walked
with the saints, after a not uneventful career in robbing the
King&rsquo;s Revenue of a goodly portion of its dues as by law
enacted.&nbsp; With the eminent Mr. Henry Carter and his
interesting brothers we have already dealt, reserving this
chapter for the still more eminent Rattenbury, &ldquo;commonly
called,&rdquo; as he says on his own title-page (in the manner of
one who knows his own worth), &ldquo;The Rob Roy of the
West.&rdquo;
We need not be so simple as to suppose that <a
name="page184">p. 184Rattenbury
himself actually wrote, with his own hand, this interesting
account of his adventures.&nbsp; The son of a village cobbler in
South Devon, born in 1778, and taking to a seafaring life when
nine years of age, would scarce be capable, in years of eld, of
writing the conventionally &ldquo;elegant&rdquo; English of which
his &ldquo;Autobiography&rdquo; is composed.&nbsp; But nothing
&ldquo;transpires&rdquo; (as the actual writer of the book might
say) as to whom Rattenbury recounted his moving tale, or by whose
hand it was really set down.&nbsp; Bating, however, the
conventional language, the book has the unmistakable forthright
first-hand character of a personal narrative.
Before the future smuggler was born, as he tells us, his
shoemaker, or cobbler, father disappeared from Beer in a manner
in those days not unusual.&nbsp; He went on board a
man-o&rsquo;-war, and was never again heard of.&nbsp; Whether he
actually &ldquo;went,&rdquo; or was taken by a press-gang, we are
left to conjecture.&nbsp; But they were sturdy, self-reliant
people in those days, and Mrs. Rattenbury earned a livelihood in
this bereavement by selling fish, &ldquo;without receiving the
least assistance from the parish, or any of her
friends.&rdquo;
When Jack Rattenbury was nine years of age he was introduced
to the sea by means of his uncle&rsquo;s fishing-boat, but
dropped the family connection upon being lustily
rope&rsquo;s-ended by the uncle, as a reward for losing the
boat&rsquo;s rudder.&nbsp; He then went apprentice to a Brixham
fisherman, but, being the younger among several <a
name="page185">p.
185apprentices, was accordingly bullied, and left;
returning to Beer, where he found his uncle busily engaging a
privateer&rsquo;s crew, war having again broken out between
England and France, and merchantmen being a likely prey.




So behold our bold privateer setting forth, keen for loot and
distinction; the hearts of men and boys alike beating high in
hope of such glory as might attach to capturing some defenceless
trader, and in anticipation of the prize-money to be obtained by
robbing him.&nbsp; But see the irony of the gods in their high
heavens!&nbsp; After seven weeks&rsquo; fruitless and expensive
cruising at sea, they espied a likely vessel, and bore down upon
her, with the horrible result that she proved to be an armed
Frenchman of twenty-six guns, who promptly captured the
privateer, without even the pretence of a fight: the privateering
crew being sent, ironed, down below hatches aboard the Frenchman,
which then set sail for Bordeaux.&nbsp; There those more or less
gallant souls were flung into prison, whence Rattenbury managed
to escape to an American ship lying in the harbour.&nbsp; It
continued to lie there, in consequence of an embargo upon all
shipping, for twelve months: an anxious time for the boy.&nbsp;
At last, the interdict being removed, they sailed, and Rattenbury
landed at New York.&nbsp; From that port he returned to France in
another American ship, landing at Havre; and at last, after a
variety of transhipments, came home again to Beer, by way of
Guernsey.
p. 186He
was by this time about sixteen years of age.&nbsp; For six months
he remained at home engaged in fishing; but this he found a very
dull occupation after his late roving life, and, as smuggling was
then very active in the neighbourhood, and promised both profit
and excitement, he accordingly engaged in a small vessel that
plied between Lyme Regis and the Channel Islands, chiefly in the
cognac-smuggling business.&nbsp; This interlude likewise soon
came to an end, and he then joined a small vessel called The
Friends, lying at Bridport.&nbsp; On his first voyage, in the
entirely honest business of sailing to Tenby for a cargo of culm,
this ship was unlucky enough to be captured by a French
privateer; but Rattenbury escaped by a clever ruse, off Swanage,
and, swimming ashore, secured the intervention of the
Nancy, revenue cutter, which recaptured The
Friends, and brought her into Cowes that same night: a very
smart piece of work, as will be readily conceded.&nbsp; Those
were times of quick and surprising changes, and Rattenbury had
not been again aboard The Friends more than two days when
he was forcibly enlisted in the Navy, by the press-gang.&nbsp;
Escaping from the more or less glorious service of his country at
the end of a fortnight, he then prudently went on a long
cod-fishing cruise off Newfoundland; but on the return voyage the
ship was captured by a Spanish privateer and taken to Vigo.&nbsp;
Escaping thence, he again reached home, to be captured by the
bright eyes of one of the buxom maids of Beer, where he was
married, p.
187April 17th, 1801, proceeding then to live at Lyme
Regis.&nbsp; Privateering to the west coast of Africa then
occupied his activities for a time, but that business was never a
profitable one, as far as Rattenbury was concerned, and they
caught nothing; but, on the other hand, were nearly impressed,
ship and ship&rsquo;s company too, by the Alert,
King&rsquo;s cutter.&nbsp; Piloting, rather than privateering,
then engaged his attention, and it was while occupied in that
trade that he was again impressed and again escaped.
He then returned to Beer, and embarked upon a series of
smuggling ventures, varied by attempts on the part of the
press-gang to lay hold of him, and by some other (and always
barren) privateering voyages.&nbsp; Ostensibly engaged in
fishing, he landed many boat-loads of contraband at Beer,
bringing them from quiet spots on the coasts of Dorset and
Hampshire, where the goods had been hidden.&nbsp; Christchurch
was one of these smugglers&rsquo; warehouses, and from the creeks
of that flat shore he and his fellows brought many a load, in
open boats.&nbsp; On one of these occasions he fell in with the
Roebuck revenue tender, which chased and fired upon him:
the man who fired doing the damage to himself, for the gun burst
and blew off his arm.&nbsp; But Rattenbury and his companions
were captured, and their boat-load of gin was impounded.&nbsp;
Rattenbury surely was a very Puck among smugglers: a tricksy
sprite, at once impudent and astonishingly fortunate.&nbsp; He
hid p.
188himself in the bottom of the enemy&rsquo;s own boat,
and by some magical dexterity escaped when it touched shore:
while his companions were held prisoners.&nbsp; Nay, more.&nbsp;
When night was come, he was impudent enough, and successful
enough, to go and release his friends, and at the same time to
bring away three of the captured gin-kegs.&nbsp; In that same
winter of 1805 he made seven trips in a new-built smuggling
vessel.&nbsp; Five of these were successful ventures, and two
were failures.&nbsp; In the spring of 1806 his crew and cargo of
spirit-tubs were captured, on returning from Alderney, by the
Duke of York cutter.&nbsp; He was taken to Dartmouth, and,
with his companions, fined and given the alternative of
imprisonment or serving aboard a man-o&rsquo;-war.&nbsp; After a
very short experience of gaol, they chose to serve their country,
chiefly because it was much easier to desert that service than to
break prison; and they were then shipped in Dartmouth roads,
whence Rattenbury escaped from the navy tender while the officers
were all drunk; coming ashore in a fisherman&rsquo;s boat, and
thence making his way home by walking and riding horseback to
Brixham, and from that port by fishing-smack.
Soon after this adventure he purchased a share in a galley,
and, with some companions, made several successful trips in the
cognac-smuggling between Beer and Alderney.&nbsp; At last the
galley was lost in a storm, and in rowing an open boat across
Channel Rattenbury and <span
class="pagenum">p. 189another were captured by the
Humber sloop, and taken for trial to Falmouth and
committed to Bodmin gaol, to which they were consigned in two
post-chaises, in company with two constables.&nbsp; Travellers
were thirsty folk in those days, and at every inn between
Falmouth and Bodmin the chaises were halted, so that the
constables could refresh themselves.&nbsp; Evening was come
before they had reached Bodmin, and while the now half-seas-over
constables were taking another dram at the lonely wayside inn
called the &ldquo;Indian Queens,&rdquo; Rattenbury and his
companions conspired to escape.&nbsp; Behold them, then, when
ordered by the constables to resume their places, refusing, and
entering into a desperate struggle with those officers of the
law.&nbsp; A pistol was fired, the shot passing close to
Rattenbury&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; He and his companion then downed
the constables and escaped across the moors; where, meeting with
another party of smugglers, they were sheltered at Newquay.&nbsp;
Next morning they travelled horseback, in company with the host
who had sheltered them, to Mevagissey, whence they hired a boat
to Budleigh Salterton, and thence walked home again to Beer.
Next year Rattenbury was appointed captain of a smuggling
vessel called the Trafalgar, and after five fortunate
voyages had the misfortune to lose her in heavy weather off
Alderney.&nbsp; He and some associates then bought a vessel
called the Lively, but she was chased by a French <a
name="page190">p. 190privateer
and the helmsman shot.&nbsp; The privateer&rsquo;s captain was so
overcome by this incidental killing that he relinquished his
prize.&nbsp; After a few more trips, the Lively proved
unseaworthy, and the confederates then purchased the
Neptune, which was wrecked after three successful voyages
had been made.&nbsp; But Rattenbury tells us, with some pride,
that he saved the cargo.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, however, the
Lively having been repaired, had put to sea in the
smuggling interest again, and had been captured and confiscated
by the revenue officers.&nbsp; Rattenbury lost &pound;160 by that
business.&nbsp; Soon afterwards he took a share in a twelve-oared
galley, and was one of those who went in it to Alderney for a
cargo.&nbsp; On the return they were unfortunate enough to fall
in with two revenue cutters: the Stork and the
Swallow, that had been especially detailed to capture
them; and accordingly did execute that commission, in as thorough
and workmanlike fashion as possible, seizing the tubs and
securing the persons of Rattenbury and two others; although the
nine other oarsmen escaped.&nbsp; Captain Emys, of the
Stork, took Rattenbury aboard his vessel, and treated him
well, inviting him to his cabin and to eat and drink with
him.&nbsp; Next day the smugglers were landed at Cowes.
&ldquo;Rattenbury,&rdquo; said the genial captain, &ldquo;I am
going to send you aboard a man-o&rsquo;-war, and you must get
clear how you can.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this the saucy Rattenbury
replied, &ldquo;Sir, you have been giving me roast meat ever
since I have been p.
191aboard, and now you have run the spit into
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was then put aboard the Royal William,
on which he found a great many other smuggler prisoners.&nbsp;
Thence, in the course of a fortnight, he and the others were
drafted to the Resistance frigate, and sent to Cork.&nbsp;
Arrived there, our slippery Rattenbury duly escaped in course of
the following day, and was home again in six days more.
The activities of the smugglers were at times exceedingly
unpatriotic, in other ways than merely cheating the Revenue, and
Rattenbury was no whit better than his fellows.&nbsp; He had not
long returned home when he made arrangements, for the substantial
consideration of one hundred pounds, to embark across the Channel
four French officers, prisoners of war, who had escaped from
captivity at Tiverton.&nbsp; Receiving them on arrival at Beer,
and concealing them in a house near the beach, their presence was
soon detected and warrants were issued for the arrest of
Rattenbury and five others concerned.&nbsp; Rattenbury adopted
the safest course and surrendered voluntarily, and was acquitted,
with a magisterial caution not to do it again.
Every now and again Rattenbury found himself arrested, or in
danger of being arrested, as a deserter from the Navy.&nbsp;
Returning on one of many occasions from a successful smuggling
trip to Alderney, and drinking at an inn, he found himself in
company with a sergeant and several privates of the South Devon
Militia.&nbsp; Presently <span
class="pagenum">p. 192the sergeant, advancing towards him,
said, &ldquo;You are my prisoner.&nbsp; You are a deserter, and
must go along with me.&rdquo;
Must! what meaning was there in that imperative word for the
bold smuggler of old?&nbsp; None.&nbsp; But Rattenbury&rsquo;s
first method was suavity, especially as the militia had armed
themselves with swords and muskets, and as such weapons are
exceptionally dangerous things in the hands of militiamen.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sergeant,&rdquo; said he (or says his author for him, in
that English which surely Rattenbury himself never employed)
&ldquo;you are surely labouring under an error.&nbsp; I have done
nothing that can authorise you in taking me up, or detaining me;
you must certainly have mistaken me for some other
person.&rdquo;
He then describes how he drew the sergeant into a parley, and
how, in course of it, he jumped into the cellar, and, throwing
off jacket and shirt, to prevent any one holding him, armed
himself with a reaphook and bade defiance to all who should
attempt to take him.
The situation was relieved at last by the artful women of Beer
rushing in with an entirely fictitious story of a shipwreck and
attracting the soldiers&rsquo; attention.&nbsp; In midst of this
diversion, Rattenbury jumped out, and, dashing down to the beach,
got aboard his vessel.&nbsp; After this incident he kept out of
Beer as much as possible; and shortly afterwards was successful
in piloting the Linskill transport through a storm that
was likely to have wrecked her, and so safely into <a
name="page193">p. 193the
Solent.&nbsp; He earned twenty guineas by this; and received the
advice of the captain to get a handbill printed, detailing the
circumstances of this service, by way of set-off against the
various desertions for which he was liable to be at any time
called to account.
Soon after this, Lord and Lady Rolle visited Beer, and
Rattenbury&rsquo;s wife took occasion to present his lordship
with one of the bills that had been struck off.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
sorry,&rdquo; observed Lord Rolle, reading it, &ldquo;that I
cannot do anything for your husband, as I am told he was the man
who threatened to cut my sergeant&rsquo;s guts out.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Such, you see, was the execution Rattenbury, at bay in the
cellar, had proposed with his reaphook upon the military.
Hearing this, and learning that Lady Rolle was also in the
village, he ran after her, and overtaking her carriage, fell upon
his knees and presented one of his handbills, entreating her
ladyship to use her influence on his behalf, so that the
authorities might not be allowed to take him.&nbsp; It is a
ridiculous picture, but Rattenbury makes no shame in presenting
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;She then said,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;you
ought to go back on board a man-o&rsquo;-war, and be equal to
Lord Nelson; you have such spirits for fighting.&nbsp; If you do
so, you may depend I will take care you shall not be
hurt.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which he replied; &ldquo;My lady, I have
ever had an aversion to [sic] the Navy.&nbsp; I wish to remain
with my wife and family, and to support them in a creditable <a
name="page194">p. 194manner, <a
name="citation194"><a href="#footnote194"
class="citation">[194] and therefore can never think of
returning.&rdquo;
Her ladyship then said, &ldquo;I will consider about
it,&rdquo; and turned off.&nbsp; About a week afterwards, the
soldiers were ordered away from Beer, through the influence of
her ladyship, as I conjecture, and the humanity of Lord
Rolle.
And so Rattenbury was left in peace.&nbsp; He tells us that he
would have now entered upon a new course of life, but found
himself &ldquo;engaged in difficulties from which I was unable to
escape, and bound by a chain of circumstances whose links I was
unable to break. . . .&nbsp; I seriously resolved to abandon the
trade of smuggling; to take a public-house, and to employ my
leisure hours in fishing, etc.&nbsp; At first the house appeared
to answer pretty well, but after being in it for two years, I
found that I was considerably gone back in the world; for that my
circumstances, instead of improving, were daily getting worse,
for all the money I could get by fishing and piloting went to the
brewer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, he says, he was obliged to return to
smuggling; but we cannot help suspecting that Rattenbury is here
not quite honest with us, and that smuggling offered just that
alluring admixture of gain and adventure he found himself
incapable of resisting.
Adventures, it has been truly said, are to the adventurous;
and Rattenbury&rsquo;s career offered no exception to the
rule.&nbsp; There was, perhaps, <span
class="pagenum">p. 195never so unlucky a smuggler as
he.&nbsp; Returning to the trade in November 1812, and returning
with a cargo of spirits from Alderney, his vessel fell in with
the brig Catherine, and was pursued, heavily fired upon,
and finally captured.&nbsp; The captain of the Catherine,
raging at them, declared they should all be sent aboard a
man-o&rsquo;-war; but a search of the smuggling craft revealed
nothing except one solitary pint of gin in a bottle: the cargo
having presumably been put over the side.&nbsp; The crew were,
however, taken prisoners aboard the Catherine, and their
vessel was taken to Brixham.&nbsp; Rattenbury and his men were
kept aboard the Catherine for a week, cruising in the
Channel, and then the brig put in again to Brixham, where the
wives of the prisoners were anxiously waiting.&nbsp; Next
morning, in the absence of the captain and chief officer ashore,
the women came off in a boat, and were helped aboard the brig;
when Rattenbury and three of his men jumped into the boat and
pushed off.&nbsp; The second mate, who was in charge of the
vessel, caught hold of the oar Rattenbury was using, and broke
the blade of it, and the smuggler then threw the remaining part
at him.&nbsp; The mate then fired; whereupon Rattenbury&rsquo;s
wife knocked the firearm out of his hand.&nbsp; Picking it up, he
fired again, but the boat&rsquo;s sail was up, and the fugitives
were well on the way to shore, and made good their escape, amid a
shower of bullets.&nbsp; They then dispersed, two of them being
afterwards re-taken and sent aboard a man-o&rsquo;-war bound for
the West p.
196Indies; but Rattenbury made his way safely home again
and was presently joined there by his wife.
The public-house was closed in November 1813, smuggling was
for a time in a bad way, owing to the Channel being closely
patrolled; and Rattenbury, now with a wife and four children,
made but a scanty subsistence on fishing and a little
piloting.&nbsp; In September 1814 he ventured again in the
smuggling way, making a successful run to and from Cherbourg, but
in November another run was quite spoilt, in the first instance
by a gale, which obliged the smugglers to sink their kegs, and in
the second by the revenue officers seizing the boats.&nbsp;
Finally, on the next day a custom-house boat ran over their buoy
marking the spot where the kegs had been sunk, and seized them
all&mdash;over a hundred.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; says
Rattenbury, with the conciseness of a resigned victim, &ldquo;was
a severe loss.&rdquo;
The succeeding years were more fortunate for him.&nbsp; In
1816 he bought the sloop Elizabeth and Kitty, cheap,
having been awarded a substantial sum as salvage, for having
rescued her when deserted by her crew; and all that year did very
well in smuggling spirits from Cherbourg.&nbsp; Successes and
failures, arrests, escapes, or releases, then followed in
plentiful succession until the close of 1825, when the most
serious happening of his adventurous career occurred.&nbsp; He
was captured off Dawlish, on December 18th, returning from a
smuggling expedition, and detained at <span
class="pagenum">p. 197Budleigh Salterton watch-house until
January 2nd, when he was taken before the magistrates at Exeter,
and committed to gaol.&nbsp; There he remained until April 5th,
1827.&nbsp; In 1829 he says he &ldquo;made an application&rdquo;
to Lord Rolle, who gave him a letter to the Admiral at
Portsmouth, and went aboard the Tartar cutter.&nbsp; In
January 1830 he took his discharge, received his pay at the
custom-house, and went home.
Very slyly does he withhold from us the subject of that
application, and the nature of the Tartar&rsquo;s
commission; and it is left for us to discover that the bold
smuggler had taken service at last with the revenue and customs
authorities, and for a time placed his knowledge of the ins and
outs of smuggling at the command of those whose duty it was to
defeat the free-traders.&nbsp; It was perhaps the discovery that
the work of spying and betraying was irksome, or perhaps the
ready threats of his old associates, that caused him to
relinquish the work.
However that may be, he was soon at smuggling again, carried
on in between genuine trading enterprises; and in November 1831
was unlucky enough to be chased and captured by the Beer
preventive boat.&nbsp; As usual, the cargo was carefully sunk
before the capture was actually made, and although the preventive
men strenuously grappled for it, they found nothing but a piece
of rope, about one fathom long.&nbsp; On the very slight
presumptive evidence of that length of rope, Rattenbury and his
eldest son and two men <span
class="pagenum">p. 198were found guilty on their trial at
Lyme Regis, and were committed to Dorchester gaol.&nbsp; There
they remained until February 1833.
Rattenbury&rsquo;s last smuggling experience was a shoregoing
one, in the month of January 1836, at Torquay, where he was
engaged with another man in carting a load of twenty tubs of
brandy.&nbsp; They had got about a mile out of Newton Abbot, at
ten o&rsquo;clock at night, when a party of riding-officers came
up and seized the consignment &ldquo;in the King&rsquo;s
name.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rattenbury escaped, being as eel-like and
evasive as ever, but his companion was arrested.
Thus, before he was quite fifty-eight years of age, he quitted
an exceptionally chequered career; but his wonted fires lived in
his son, who continued the tradition, even though the great days
of smuggling were by now done.
That son was charged, at Exeter Assizes, in March 1836, with
having on the night of December 1st, 1835, taken part with others
in assaulting two custom-house officers at Budleigh
Salterton.&nbsp; Numerous witnesses swore to his having been at
Beer that night, sixteen miles away, but he was found guilty and
sentenced to seven years&rsquo; transportation; the Court being
quite used to this abundant evidence, and quite convinced, Bible
oaths to the contrary notwithstanding, that he was at Budleigh
Salterton, and did in fact take part in maltreating His
Majesty&rsquo;s officers.
Jack Rattenbury was on this occasion <a
name="page199">p.
199cross-examined by the celebrated Mr. Serjeant Bompas,
in which he declared he had brought up that son in a proper way,
and &ldquo;larnt him the Creed, the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, and the
Ten Commandments.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Perhaps also that important
Eleventh Commandment, &ldquo;Thou shalt not be found
out!&rdquo;)
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t find there, &lsquo;Thou shalt not
smuggle?&rsquo;&rdquo; asked Mr. Serjeant Bompas.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Rattenbury the ready, &ldquo;but I
find there, &lsquo;Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbour.&rsquo;&rdquo;
The injured innocent, like to be transported for his
country&rsquo;s good, was granted a Royal Pardon, as the result
of several petitions sent to Lord John Russell.
The village of Beer, deep down in one of the most romantic
rocky coves of South Devon, is nowadays a very different kind of
place from what it was in Rattenbury&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Then the
home of fishermen daring alike in fishing and in smuggling, a
village to which strangers came but rarely, it is now very much
of a favourite seaside resort, and full of boarding-houses that
have almost entirely abolished the ancient thatched
cottages.&nbsp; A few of these yet linger on, together with one
or two of the curious old stone water-conduits and some stretches
of the primitive cobbled pavements, but they will not long
survive.&nbsp; The sole characteristic industry of Beer that is
left, besides the fishing and the stone-quarrying that has been
in progress from the very earliest <span
class="pagenum">p. 200times, is the lace-making, nowadays
experiencing a revival.
But the knowing ones will show you still the smugglers&rsquo;
caves: deep crannies in the chalk cliffs of Beer, that at this
place so curiously alternate with the more characteristic red
sandstone of South Devon.

201CHAPTER XIV
<span
class="smcap">The Whisky Smugglers
A modern form of smuggling little
suspected by the average Englishman is found in the illicit
whisky-distilling yet carried on in the Highlands of Scotland and
the wilds of Ireland, as the records of Inland Revenue
prosecutions still annually prove.&nbsp; The sportsman, or the
more adventurous among those tourists who roam far from the
beaten track, are still likely to discover in rugged and remote
situations the ruins of rough stone and turf huts of no
antiquity, situated in lonely rifts in the mountain-sides, always
with a stream running by.&nbsp; If the stranger is at all
inquisitive on the subject of these solitary ruins, he will
easily discover that not only are they not old, but that they
have, in many cases, only recently been vacated.&nbsp; They are,
in fact, the temporary bothies built from the abundant materials
of those wild spots by the ingenious crofters and other
peasantry, for the purpose of distilling whisky that shall not,
between its manufacture and its almost immediate consumption, pay
duty to the revenue authorities.
p. 202This
illegal production of what is now thought to be the
&ldquo;national drink&rdquo; of Scotland and Ireland, is not of
any considerable antiquity, for whisky itself did not grow
popular until comparatively recent times.&nbsp; Robert Burns, who
may not unfairly be considered the poet-laureate of whisky, and
styles it &ldquo;whisky, drink divine,&rdquo; would have had
neither the possibility of that inspiration, nor have filled the
official post of exciseman, had he flourished but a few
generations earlier; but he was born in that era when
whisky-smuggling and dram-drinking were at their height, and he
took an active part in both the drinking of whisky and the
hunting down of smugglers of it.
One of the most stirring incidents of his career was that
which occurred in 1792, when, foremost of a little band of
revenue officers, aided by dragoons, he waded into the waters of
Solway, reckless of the quicksands of that treacherous estuary,
and, sword in hand, was the first to board a smuggling brig,
placing the crew under arrest and conveying the vessel to
Dumfries, where it was sold.&nbsp; It was this incident that
inspired him with the poem, if indeed, we may at all fitly claim
inspiration for such an inferior Burns product:
THE DE&rsquo;IL&rsquo;S
AWA&rsquo; WI&rsquo; THE EXCISEMAN
The De&rsquo;il cam&rsquo; fiddling thro&rsquo; the town,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And danc&rsquo;d awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; the
exciseman;
And ilka wife cry&rsquo;d, &ldquo;Auld Mahoun,
&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish you luck o&rsquo; your prize, man.&rdquo;
p.
203We&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; our maut and brew our drink,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll dance, and sing, and rejoice, man;
And monie thanks to the muckle black De&rsquo;il,
&nbsp;&nbsp; That danced awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; the exciseman.
There&rsquo;s threesome reels, and foursome reels,
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s hornpipes and strathspeys, man;
But the ae best dance e&rsquo;er cam&rsquo; to our lan&rsquo;,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was&mdash;the De&rsquo;il&rsquo;s awa&rsquo;
wi&rsquo; the exciseman.

Whisky, i.e. usquebaugh, signifying in Gaelic
&ldquo;water of life,&rdquo; originated, we are told, in the
monasteries, where so many other comforting cordials were
discovered, somewhere about the eleventh or twelfth
century.&nbsp; It was for a very long period regarded only as a
medicine, and its composition remained unknown to the generality
of people; and thus we find among the earliest accounts of
whisky, outside monastic walls, an item in the household expenses
of James the Fourth of Scotland, at the close of the fifteenth
century.&nbsp; There it is styled &ldquo;aqua
vit&aelig;.&rdquo;
A sample of this then new drink was apparently introduced to
the notice of the King or his Court, and seems to have been so
greatly appreciated that eight bolls of malt figure among the
household items as delivered to &ldquo;Friar James Cor,&rdquo;
for the purpose of manufacturing more, as per sample.
But for generations to come the nobles and gentry of Scotland
continued to drink wine, and the peasantry to drink ale, and it
was only with the closing years of another century that whisky <a
name="page204">p. 204became at
all commonly manufactured.&nbsp; We read that in 1579 distillers
were for the first time taxed in Scotland, and private stills
forbidden; and the rural population did not altogether forsake
their beer for the spirit until about the beginning of the
eighteenth century.&nbsp; Parliament, however, soon discovered a
tempting source of revenue in it, and imposed constantly
increasing taxation.&nbsp; In 1736 the distillers&rsquo; tax was
raised to 20s. a gallon, and there were, in addition,
imposts upon the retailers.
It might have been foreseen that the very natural result of
these extortionate taxes would be to elevate illegal distilling,
formerly practised here and there, into an enormously increased
industry, flourishing in every glen.&nbsp; Only a very small
proportion of the output paid the duties imposed.&nbsp; Every
clachan had its still, or stills.
This state of things was met by another Act which prohibited
the making of whisky from stills of a smaller capacity than five
hundred gallons; but this enactment merely brought about the
removal of the more or less openly defiant stills from the
villages to the solitary places in the hills and mountains, and
necessitated a large increase in the number of excisemen.
Seven years of these extravagant super-taxes sufficed to
convince the Government of the folly of so overweighting an
article with taxation that successful smuggling of it would
easily bring fortunes to bold and energetic men.&nbsp; To do so
was thus abundantly proved to be a direct <a
name="page205">p. 205provocation
to men of enterprise; and the net result the Government found to
be a vastly increased and highly expensive excise establishment,
whose cost was by no means met by the revenue derived from the
heavy duties.&nbsp; Failure thus becoming evident, the taxes were
heavily reduced, until they totalled but ten shillings and
sixpence a gallon.
But the spice of adventure introduced by illegal distilling
under the old heavy taxation had aroused a reckless frame of mind
among the Highlanders, who, once become used to defy the
authorities, were not readily persuaded to give up their illegal
practices.&nbsp; The glens continued to be filled with private
stills.&nbsp; Glenlivet was, in especial, famed for its
whisky-smugglers; and the peat-reek arose in every surrounding
fold in the hills from hundreds of &ldquo;sma&rsquo;
stills.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many of these private undertakings did
business in a large way, and openly sold their products to
customers in the south, sending their tubs of spirits under
strong escort, for great distances.&nbsp; They had customers in
England also, and exciting incidents arose at the Border, for not
only the question of excise then arose, but that of customs duty
as well; for the customs rates on spirits were then higher in
England than in Scotland.&nbsp; The border counties of
Northumberland and Cumberland, Berwick, Roxburgh, and
Dumfriesshire were infested with smugglers of this double-dyed
type, to whom must be added the foreign contrabandists, such as
the Dutchman, Yawkins, who haunted the <a
name="page206">p. 206coasts of
Dumfriesshire and Galloway with his smuggling lugger, the
Black Prince, and is supposed to be the original of Dirk
Hatteraick, in Scott&rsquo;s romance, &ldquo;Guy
Mannering.&rdquo;
The very name of this bold fellow was a terror to those whose
duty it was to uphold law and order in those parts; and it was,
naturally, to his interest to maintain that feeling of dread, by
every means in his power.&nbsp; Scott tells us how, on one
particular night, happening to be ashore with a considerable
quantity of goods in his sole custody, a strong party of
excisemen came down upon him.&nbsp; Far from shunning the attack,
Yawkins sprang forward, shouting, &ldquo;Come on, my lads,
Yawkins is before you.&rdquo;
The revenue officers were intimidated, and relinquished their
prize, though defended only by the courage and address of one
man.&nbsp; On his proper element, Yawkins was equally
successful.&nbsp; On one occasion he was landing his cargo at the
Manxman&rsquo;s Lake, near Kirkcudbright, when two revenue
cutters, the Pigmy and the Dwarf, hove in sight at
once, on different tacks, the one coming round by the Isles of
Fleet, the other between the point of Rueberry and the Muckle
Ron.&nbsp; The dauntless free-trader instantly weighed anchor and
bore down right between the luggers, so close that he tossed his
hat on the deck of the one and his wig on that of the other,
hoisted a cask to his maintop, to show his occupation, and bore
away under an extraordinary pressure of canvas, without receiving
injury.
p. 207So,
at any rate, the fantastic legends tell us, although it is but
fair to remark, in this place, that no practical yachtsman, or
indeed any other navigator, would for a moment believe in the
possibility of such a feat.
To account for these and other hairbreadth escapes, popular
superstition freely alleged that Yawkins insured his celebrated
lugger by compounding with the Devil for one-tenth of his crew
every voyage.&nbsp; How they arranged the separation of the stock
and tithes is left to our conjecture.&nbsp; The lugger was
perhaps called the Black Prince in honour of the
formidable insurer.&nbsp; Her owner&rsquo;s favourite
landing-places were at the entrance of the Dee and the Cree, near
the old castle of Rueberry, about six miles below
Kirkcudbright.&nbsp; There is a cave of large dimensions in the
vicinity of Rueberry, which, from its being frequently used by
Yawkins and his supposed connection with the smugglers on the
shore, is now called &ldquo;Dirk Hatteraick&rsquo;s
Cave.&rdquo;&nbsp; Strangers who visit this place, the scenery of
which is highly romantic, are also shown, under the name of the
&ldquo;Gauger&rsquo;s Leap,&rdquo; a tremendous precipice.
&ldquo;In those halcyon days of the free trade,&rdquo; says
Scott, &ldquo;the fixed price for carrying a box of tea or bale
of tobacco from the coast of Galloway to Edinburgh was fifteen
shillings, and a man with two horses carried four such
packages.&rdquo;
This condition of affairs prevailed until peace had come,
after the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.&nbsp; The
Government then, as always, <span
class="pagenum">p. 208sadly in need of new sources of
revenue, was impressed with the idea that a fine sum might
annually be obtained by placing these shy Highland distillers
under contribution.&nbsp; But there were great difficulties in
the way.&nbsp; The existing laws were a mere dead letter in those
regions, and it was scarce likely that any new measures, unless
backed up by a display of military force, would secure
obedience.&nbsp; The Duke of Gordon, at that period a personage
of exceptionally commanding influence with the clansmen, was
appealed to by the Government to use his authority for the
purpose of discouraging these practices; but he declared, from
his place in the House of Lords, that the Highlanders were
hereditary distillers of whisky: it had from time immemorial been
their drink, and they would, in spite of every discouragement,
continue to make it and to consume it.&nbsp; They would sell it,
too, he said, when given the opportunity of doing so by the
extravagantly high duty on spirits.&nbsp; The only way out of the
difficulty with which the Government was confronted was, he
pointed out, the passing of an Act permitting the distilling of
whisky on reasonable terms.
The result of this straightforward speech was the passing of
an Act in 1823 which placed the moderate excise duty of
2s. 3d. a gallon on the production of spirits, with
a &pound;10 annual license for every still of a capacity of forty
gallons: smaller stills being altogether illegal.
These provisions were reasonable enough, but <a
name="page209">p. 209failed to
satisfy the peasantry, and the people were altogether so opposed
to the regulation of distilling that they destroyed the licensed
distilleries.&nbsp; It was scarce worth the while of retailers,
under those circumstances, to take out licenses, and so it
presently came to pass that for every one duly licensed dealer
there would be, according to the district, from fifty to one
hundred unlicensed.
And so things remained until by degrees the gradually
perfected system of excise patrols wore down this resistance.
In the meanwhile, the licensed distillers had a sorry time of
it.
Archibald Forbes, many years ago, in the course of some
observations upon whisky-smugglers, gave reminiscences of George
Smith, who, from having in his early days been himself a
smuggler, became manager of the Glenlivet Distillery.&nbsp; This
famous manufactory of whisky, in these days producing about two
thousand gallons a week, had an output in 1824 of but one hundred
gallons in the same time; and its very existence was for years
threatened by the revengeful peasantry and proprietors of the
&ldquo;sma&rsquo; stills.&rdquo;&nbsp; Smith was a man of fine
physical proportions and great courage and tenacity of purpose,
or he could never have withstood the persecutions and dangers he
had long to face.&nbsp; &ldquo;The outlook,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;was an ugly one.&nbsp; I was warned, before I began, by my
neighbours that they meant to burn the new distillery to the <a
name="page210">p. 210ground, and
me in the heart of it.&nbsp; The Laird of Aberlour presented me
with a pair of hair-trigger pistols, and they were never out of
my belt for years.&nbsp; I got together three or four stout
fellows for servants, armed them with pistols, and let it be
known everywhere that I would fight for my place till the last
shot.&nbsp; I had a pretty good character as a man of my word,
and through watching, by turns, every night for years, we
contrived to save the distillery from the fate so freely
predicted for it.&nbsp; But I often, both at kirk and market, had
rough times of it among the glen people, and if it had not been
for the Laird of Aberlour&rsquo;s pistols I don&rsquo;t think I
should have been telling you this story now.&rdquo;
In &rsquo;25 and &rsquo;26 three more small distilleries were
started in the glen; but the smugglers succeeded very soon in
frightening away their occupants, none of whom ventured to hang
on a second year in the face of the threats uttered against
them.&nbsp; Threats were not the only weapons used.&nbsp; In 1825
a distillery which had just been started at the head of
Aberdeenshire, near the banks o&rsquo; Dee, was burnt to the
ground with all its outbuildings and appliances, and the
distiller had a very narrow escape of being roasted in his own
kiln.&nbsp; The country was in a desperately lawless state at
this time.&nbsp; The riding-officers of the Revenue were the mere
sport of the smugglers, and nothing was more common than for them
to be shown a still at work, and then coolly defied to make a
seizure.
p.
211Prominent among these active and resourceful men was
one Shaw, proprietor of a shebeen on the Shea Water, in the wilds
of Mar.&nbsp; Smugglers were free of his shy tavern, which, as a
general rule, the gaugers little cared to visit singly.&nbsp;
Shaw was alike a man of gigantic size, great strength, and of
unscrupulous character, and stuck at little in the furtherance of
his illegal projects.&nbsp; But if Shaw was a terror to the
average exciseman, George Smith, for his part, was above the
average, and feared no man; and so, when overtaken by a storm on
one occasion, had little hesitation in seeking the shelter of
this ill-omened house.&nbsp; Shaw happened to be away from home
at the time, and Smith was received by the hostess, who, some
years earlier, before she had married her husband, had been a
sweetheart of the man who now sought shelter.&nbsp; The
accommodation afforded by the house was scanty, but a bedroom was
found for the unexpected guest, and he in due course retired to
it.&nbsp; Mrs. Shaw had promised that his natural enemies, the
smugglers, should not disturb him, if they returned in the night;
but when they did return, later on, Shaw determined that he would
at least give the distillery man a fright.&nbsp; Most of them
were drunk, and ready for any mischief, and would probably have
been prepared even to murder him.&nbsp; Shaw was, however, with
all his faults, no little of a humorist, and only wanted his joke
at the enemy&rsquo;s expense.
The band marched upstairs solemnly, in spite of some little
hiccoughing, and swung into the <span
class="pagenum">p. 212bedroom, a torch carried by the
foremost man throwing a fitful glare around.&nbsp; The door was
locked when they had entered, and all gathered in silence round
the bed.&nbsp; Shaw then, drawing a great butcher&rsquo;s knife
from the recesses of his clothes, brandished it over the
affrighted occupant of the bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;This gully, mon, iss
for your powels,&rdquo; said he.
But Smith had not entered this House of Dread without being
properly armed, and he had, moreover, taken his pistols to bed
with him, and was at that moment holding one in either hand,
under the clothes.&nbsp; As Shaw flourished his knife and uttered
his alarming threats, he whipped out the one and presented it at
Shaw&rsquo;s head, promising him he would shoot him if the whole
party did not immediately quit the room; while with the other
(the bed lying beside the fireplace) he fired slyly up the
chimney, creating a thunderous report and a choking downfall of
soot, in midst of which all the smugglers fled except Shaw, who
remained, laughing.
Shaw had many smart encounters with the excise, in which he
generally managed to get the best of it.&nbsp; The most dramatic
of these was probably the exploit that befell when he was
captaining a party of smugglers conveying two hundred kegs of
whisky from the mountains down to Perth.&nbsp; The time was
winter, and snow lay thick on field and fell; but the journey was
made in daytime, for they were a numerous band and well armed,
and feared no one.&nbsp; But the local <a
name="page213">p. 213Supervisor
of Excise had by some means obtained early news of this
expedition, and had secured the aid of a detachment of six
troopers of the Scots Greys at Coupar-Angus, part of a squadron
stationed at Perth.&nbsp; At the head of this little force rode
the supervisor.&nbsp; They came in touch with the smugglers at
Cairnwell, in the Spittal of Glenshee.
&ldquo;Gang aff awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; ye, quietly back up the
Spittal,&rdquo; exclaimed the supervisor, &ldquo;and leave the
seizure to us.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Na, faith,&rdquo; replied Shaw; &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll get
jist what we care to gie!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Say ye so?&rdquo; returned the excise officer
hotly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hae the whole or nane!&rdquo;
The blood rose in Shaw&rsquo;s head, and swelled out the veins
of his temples.&nbsp; &ldquo;By God,&rdquo; he swore,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shoot every gauger here before ye&rsquo;ll get
a drap!&rdquo;
The supervisor was a small man with a bold spirit.&nbsp; He
turned to his cavalry escort with the order &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;
and at the same time reached for Shaw&rsquo;s collar, with the
exclamation, &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve given me the slip often enough,
Shaw!&nbsp; Yield now, I&rsquo;ve a pistol in each pocket of my
breeches.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Have ye so?&rdquo; coolly returned the immense and
statuesque Shaw, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; lang they&rsquo;ll
be there, then!&rdquo; and with that he laid violent hands upon
each pocket and so picked the exciseman bodily out of his saddle,
tore out both pistols and pockets, and then pitched him, as
easily as an ordinary man could have done a baby, head over heels
into a snow-drift.
p.
214Meanwhile, the soldiers had not fired; rightly
considering that, as they were so greatly outnumbered, to do so
would be only the signal for an affray in which they would surely
be worsted.&nbsp; A wordy wrangle then followed, in which the
exciseman and the soldiers pointed out that they could not
possibly go back empty-handed; and in the end, Shaw and his
brother smugglers went their way, leaving four kegs behind,
&ldquo;just out o&rsquo; ceeveelity,&rdquo; and as some sort of
salve for the wounded honour of the law and its armed
coadjutors.
Not many gaugers were so lion-hearted as this; but one, at
least, was even more so.&nbsp; This rash hero one day met two
smugglers in a solitary situation.&nbsp; They had a cart loaded
up with whisky-kegs, and when the official, unaided, and with no
human help near, proposed single-handed to seize their
consignment and to arrest them, they must have been as genuinely
astonished as ever men have been.&nbsp; The daring man stood
there, purposeful of doing his duty, and really in grave danger
of his life; but these two smugglers, relishing the humour of the
thing, merely descended from their cart, and, seizing him and
binding him hand and foot, sat him down in the middle of the road
with wrists tied over his knees and a stick through the crook of
his legs, in the &ldquo;trussed fowl&rdquo; fashion.&nbsp; There,
in the middle of the highway, they proposed to leave him; but
when he pitifully entreated not to be left there, as he might be
run over and killed in the dark, they <span
class="pagenum">p. 215considerately carried him to the
roadside; with saturnine humour remarking that he would probably
be starved there instead, before he would be noticed.




The flood-tide of Government prosecutions of the
&ldquo;sma&rsquo; stills&rdquo; was reached in 1823&ndash;5, when
an average of one thousand four hundred cases annually was
reached.&nbsp; These were variously for actual distilling, or for
the illegal possession of malt, for which offence very heavy
penalties were exacted.
Preventive men were stationed thickly over the face of the
Highlands, the system then employed being the establishment of
&ldquo;Preventive Stations&rdquo; in important districts, and
&ldquo;Preventive Rides&rdquo; in less important
neighbourhoods.&nbsp; The stations consisted of an officer and
one or two men, who were expected by the regulations not to sleep
at the station more than six nights in the fortnight.&nbsp;
During the other eight days and nights they were to be on outside
duty.&nbsp; A ride was a solitary affair, of one exciseman.&nbsp;
Placed in authority over the stations were
&ldquo;supervisors,&rdquo; who had each five stations under his
charge, which he was bound to visit once a week.
George Smith, of Glenlivet, already quoted, early found his
position desperate.&nbsp; He was a legalised distiller, and paid
his covenanted duty to Government, and he rightly considered
himself entitled, in return for the tribute he rendered, to some
measure of protection.&nbsp; He therefore petitioned the Lords of
the Treasury to that <span
class="pagenum">p. 216effect; and my lords duly replied,
after the manner of such, that the Government would prosecute any
who dared molest him.&nbsp; This, however, was not altogether
satisfactory from Smith&rsquo;s point of view.&nbsp; He desired
rather to be protected from molestation than to be left open to
attack and the aggressors to be punished.&nbsp; A dead man
derives no satisfaction from the execution of his assassin.&nbsp;
Moreover, even the prosecution was uncertain.&nbsp; In
Smith&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;I cannot say the assurance gave
me much ease, for I could see no one in Glenlivet who dared
institute such proceedings.&rdquo;
It was necessary for a revenue officer to be almost killed in
the execution of his duty before the Government resorted to the
force requisite for the support of the civil power.&nbsp; A
revenue cutter was stationed in the Moray Firth, with a crew of
fifty men, designed to be under the orders of the excise officers
in cases of emergency.
But the smugglers were not greatly impressed with this
display, and when the excisemen, accompanied with perhaps
five-and-twenty sailors, made raids up-country, frequently met
them in great gangs of perhaps a hundred and fifty, and
recaptured any seizures they had made and adopted so threatening
an attitude that the sailors were not infrequently compelled to
beat a hasty and undignified retreat.&nbsp; One of these
expeditions was into Glenlivet itself, where the smugglers were
all Roman Catholics.&nbsp; The excisemen, with this in mind,
considered that the <span
class="pagenum">p. 217best time for a raid would be Monday
morning, after the debauch of the Sunday afternoon and night in
which the Roman Catholics were wont to indulge; and accordingly,
marching out of Elgin town on the Sunday, arrived at Glenlivet at
daybreak.&nbsp; At the time of their arrival the glen was, to all
appearance, deserted, and their coming unnoticed, and the sight
of the peat-reek rising in the still air from some forty or fifty
&ldquo;sma&rsquo; stills&rdquo; rejoiced their hearts.
But they presently discovered that their arrival had not only
been observed but foreseen, for the whole country-side was up,
and several hundred men, women, and children were assembled on
the hill-sides to bid active defiance to them.&nbsp; The
excisemen keenly desired to bring the affair to a decisive issue,
but the thirty seamen who accompanied them had a due amount of
discretion, and refused to match their pistols and cutlasses
against the muskets that the smugglers ostentatiously
displayed.&nbsp; The party accordingly marched ingloriously back,
except indeed those sailors who, having responded too freely to
the smugglers&rsquo; invitation to partake of a &ldquo;wee
drappie,&rdquo; returned gloriously drunk.&nbsp; The excisemen,
so unexpectedly baulked of what they had thought their certain
prey, ungraciously refused a taste.
This formed the limit of the sorely tried Government&rsquo;s
patience, and in 1829 a detachment of regulars was ordered up to
Braemar, with the result that smuggling was gradually reduced to
less formidable proportions.
p. 218The
Celtic nature perceives no reason why Governments should confer
upon themselves the rights of taxing and inspecting the
manufacture of spirits, any more than any other commodity.&nbsp;
The matter appears to resolve itself merely into expediency: and
the doctrine of expediency we all know to be immoral.&nbsp; The
situation was&mdash;and is, whether you apply it to spirits or to
other articles in general demand&mdash;the Government wants
revenue, and, seeking it, naturally taxes the most popular
articles of public consumption.&nbsp; The producers and the
consumers of the articles selected for these imposts just as
naturally seek to evade the taxes.&nbsp; This, to the Celtic
mind, impatient of control, is the simplest of equations.
About 1886 was the dullest time in the illicit
whisky-distilling industry of Scotland, and prosecutions fell to
an average of about twenty a year.&nbsp; Since then there has
been, as official reports tell us, in the language of
officialdom, a &ldquo;marked recrudescence&rdquo; of the
practice.&nbsp; As Mr. Micawber might explain, in plainer
English, &ldquo;there is&mdash;ah&mdash;in fact, more whisky made
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several contributory causes are responsible for
this state of things.&nbsp; Firstly, an economical Government
reduced the excise establishment; then the price of barley, the
raw material, fell; and the veiled rebellion of the crofters in
the north induced a more daring and lawless spirit than had been
known for generations past.&nbsp; Also, restrictions upon the
making of malt&mdash;another of the essential constituents from
which the spirit is distilled&mdash;<span
class="pagenum">p. 219were at this time removed, and any
one who cared might make it freely and without license.
Your true Highlander will not relinquish his
&ldquo;mountain-dew&rdquo; without a struggle.&nbsp; His
forefathers made as much of it as they liked, out of inexpensive
materials, and drank it fresh and raw.&nbsp; No one bought
whisky; and a whole clachan would be roaring drunk for a week
without a coin having changed hands.&nbsp; Naturally, the
descendants of these men&mdash;&ldquo;it wass the fine time they
had, whateffer&rdquo;&mdash;dislike the notion of buying their
whisky from the grocer and drinking stuff made in up-to-date
distilleries.&nbsp; They prefer the heady stuff of the old
brae-side pot-still, with a rasp on it like sulphuric acid and a
consequent feeling as though one had swallowed lighted petroleum:
stuff with a headache for the Southerner in every drop, not like
the tamed and subdued creature that whisky-merchants assure their
customers has not got a headache in a hogshead.
The time-honoured brae-side manner of brewing whisky is not
very abstruse.&nbsp; First find your lonely situation, the
lonelier and the more difficult of access, obviously the
better.&nbsp; If it is at once lonely and difficult of approach,
and at the same time commands good views of such approaches as
there are, by so much it is the better.&nbsp; But one very
cardinal fact must not be forgotten: the site of the proposed
still and its sheltering shieling, or bothy, must have a
water-supply, either from a mountain-stream naturally passing, or
by an artfully constructed rude system of pipes.
p. 220A
copper still, just large enough to be carried on a man&rsquo;s
back, and a small assortment of mash-tubs, and some pitchers and
pannikins, fully furnish such a rustic undertaking.
The first step is to convert your barley into malt; but this
is to-day a needless delay and trouble, now that malt can be made
entirely without let or hindrance.&nbsp; This was done by
steeping the sacks of barley in running water for some
forty-eight hours, and then storing the grain underground for a
period, until it germinated.&nbsp; The malt thus made was then
dried over a rude kiln fired with peats, whose smoke gave the
characteristic smoky taste possessed by all this bothy-made
stuff.
It was not necessary for the malt to be made on the site of
the still, and it was, and is, generally carried to the spot,
ready-made for the mash-tubs.&nbsp; The removal of the duty upon
malt by Mr. Gladstone, in 1880, was one of that grossly overrated
and really amateur statesman&rsquo;s many errors.&nbsp; His
career was full of false steps and incompetent bunglings, and the
removal of the Malt Tax was but a small example among many
Imperial tragedies on a grand scale of disaster.&nbsp; It put new
and vigorous life into whisky-smuggling, as any expert could have
foretold; for it was precisely the long operation of converting
the barley into malt that formed the illegal distiller&rsquo;s
chief difficulty.&nbsp; The time taken, and the process of
crushing or bruising the grains, offered some obstacles not
easily overcome.&nbsp; The crushing, in <a
name="page221">p. 221particular,
was a dangerous process when the possession of unlicensed malt
was an offence; for that operation resulted in a very strong and
unmistakable odour being given forth, so that no one who happened
to be in the neighbourhood when the process was going on could be
ignorant of it, while he retained his sense of smell.
Brought ready-made from the clachan to the bothy, the malt was
emptied into the mash-tubs to ferment; the tubs placed in charge
of a boy or girl, who stirs up the mess with a willow-wand or
birch-twig; while the men themselves are out and about at work on
their usual avocations.
Having sufficiently fermented, the next process was to place
the malt in the still, over a brisk heat.&nbsp; From the still a
crooked spout descends into a tub.&nbsp; This spout has to be
constantly cooled by running water, to produce condensation of
the vaporised alcohol.&nbsp; Thus we have a second, and even more
important, necessity for a neighbouring stream, which often, in
conjunction with the indispensable fire, serves the excisemen to
locate these stills.&nbsp; If a bothy is so artfully concealed by
rocks and turves that it escapes notice, even by the most
vigilant eye, amid the rugged hill-sides, the smoke arising from
the peat-fire will almost certainly betray it.
The crude spirit thus distilled into the tub is then emptied
again into the still, which has been in the meanwhile cleared of
the exhausted malt and cleansed, and subjected to a second
distilling, p.
222over a milder fire, and with a small piece of soap
dropped into the liquor to clarify it.
The question of maturing the whisky never enters into the
minds of these rustic distillers, who drink it, generally, as
soon as made.&nbsp; Very little is now made for sale; but when
sold the profit is very large, a capital of twenty-three
shillings bringing a return of nine or ten pounds.
But the typical secret whisky-distiller has no commercial
instincts.&nbsp; It cannot fairly be said that he has a soul
above them, for he is just a shiftless fellow, whose soul is not
very apparent in manner or conversation, and whose only ambition
is to procure a sufficiency of &ldquo;whusky&rdquo; for self and
friends; and a &ldquo;sufficiency&rdquo; in his case means a
great deal.&nbsp; He has not enough money to buy taxed whisky;
and if he had, he would prefer to make his own, for he loves the
peat-reek in it, and he thinks &ldquo;jist naething at
a&rsquo;&rdquo; of the &ldquo;puir stuff&rdquo; that comes from
the great distilleries.
He is generally ostensibly by trade a hanger-on to the
agricultural or sheep-farming industries, but between his spells
of five days at the bothy (for it takes five days to the making
of whisky) he is usually to be seen loafing about,
aimlessly.&nbsp; Experienced folk can generally tell where such
an one has been, and what he has been doing, after his periodical
absences, for his eyelids are red with the peat-smoke and his
clothes reek with it.




Perhaps the busiest centre of Highland illicit <a
name="page223">p.
223whisky-distilling is now to be located in the Gairloch,
but anything in the shape of exact information on so shy a
subject is necessarily not obtainable.&nbsp; Between this
district and the Outer Hebrides, islands where no stills are to
be found, a large secret trade is still believed to exist.&nbsp;
Seizures are occasionally made but the policy of the Inland
Revenue authorities is now a broad one, in which the existence of
small stills in inconsiderable numbers, although actually known,
is officially ignored: the argument being that undue official
activity, with the resultant publicity, would defeat itself by
advertising the fact of it being so easy to manufacture whisky,
leading eventually to the establishment of more stills.
The illegal production of spirits does, in fact, proceed all
over Great Britain and Ireland to a far greater extent than
generally suspected; and such remote places as the Highlands are
nowadays by no means the most favourable situations for the
manufacture.&nbsp; Indeed, crowded towns form in these times the
most ideal situations.&nbsp; No one in the great cities is in the
least interested in what his neighbour is doing, unless what he
does constitutes a nuisance: and it is the secret
distiller&rsquo;s last thought to obtrude his personality or his
doings upon the notice of the neighbours.&nbsp; Secrecy, personal
comfort, and conveniences of every kind are better obtained in
towns than on inclement brae-sides; and the manufacture and
repair of the utensils necessary to the business are effected
more quickly, less expensively, and <span
class="pagenum">p. 224without the prying curiosity of a
Highland clachan.
It follows from this long-continued course of illegal
distilling that the Highlands are full of tales of how the
gaugers were outwitted, and of hairbreadth escapes and curious
incidents.&nbsp; Among these is the story of the revengeful
postmaster of Kingussie, who, on his return from a journey to
Aberlour on a dark and stormy night, called at Dalnashaugh inn,
where he proposed to stay an hour or two.&nbsp; The pretty maid
of the inn attended diligently to him for awhile, until a posse
of some half-dozen gaugers entered, to rest there on their way to
Badenoch, where they were due, to make a raid on a number of
illicit stills.&nbsp; The sun of the postmaster suddenly set with
the arrival of these strangers.&nbsp; They were given the
parlour, and treated with the best hospitality the house could
afford, while he was banished to the kitchen.&nbsp; He was
wrathful, for was he not a Government official, equally with
these upstarts?&nbsp; But he dissembled his anger, and, as the
evening wore on and the maid grew tired, he suggested she had
better go to bed, and he would be off by time the moon
rose.&nbsp; No sooner had she retired than he took the
excisemen&rsquo;s boots, lying in the inglenook to dry, and
pitched them into a great pot of water, boiling over the
blaze.
When the moon had risen, he duly mounted his pony and set out
for Badenoch, where he gave out the news that the gaugers were
coming.
The excisemen could not stir from the inn for <a
name="page225">p. 225a
considerable time, for their boiled boots refused to be drawn on;
and by the time they had been enabled to stretch them and to set
out once more on their way, the Badenoch smugglers had made off
with all their gear, leaving nothing but empty bothies for
inspection.&nbsp; The local historian is silent as to what
happened afterwards to the postmaster, the only possible author
of this outrage.
A smuggler of Strathdearn was unfortunate in having the excise
pouncing suddenly upon him in his bothy, and taking away his only
cask of whisky.&nbsp; The hated myrmidons of a Sassenach
Government went off with the cask, and were so jealous of their
prize that they took it with them to the inn where they were to
pass the night.&nbsp; All that evening they sang songs and were
merry with a numerous company in an upper room; but even at their
merriest they did not forget their capture, and one of their
number sat upon it all the time.
It chanced, however, that among these merry fellows were some
of the smuggler&rsquo;s friends, who were careful to note exactly
the position of the cask.&nbsp; They procured an auger and bored
a hole from the room below, through the flooring and into the
cask, draining all the whisky away.&nbsp; When the excisemen had
come to the end of their jollification, they had only the empty
cask for their trouble.
One of the brae-side distillers of Fortingal brought a cart
laden with kegs of whisky into <span
class="pagenum">p. 226Perth, by arrangement with an
innkeeper of that town; but the innkeeper refused to pay a fair
price.
&ldquo;Wha will her sell it till, then?&rdquo; asked the
would-be vendor.
The innkeeper, a person of a saturnine humour, mentioned a
name and a house, and the man went thither with his cart.
&ldquo;What is it, my man?&rdquo; asked the occupier, coming
to the door.
&ldquo;Well, yer honour, &rsquo;tis some o&rsquo; the finest
whusky that iver was made up yon, and niver paid the
bawbee&rsquo;s worth o&rsquo; duty.&rdquo;
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye know who I am?&rdquo; returned the
householder.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an officer of excise, and I
demand to know who sent you to me.&rdquo;
The smuggler told him.
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the exciseman, &ldquo;go back to him
and sell him your whisky at his own price, and then
begone.&rdquo;
The man did as he was bidden; sold his consignment, and left
the town.&nbsp; It was but a few hours afterwards that the
innkeeper&rsquo;s premises were raided by the excise, who seized
the whisky and procured a conviction at the next Assizes, where
he was heavily fined.
One of the last incidents along the Border, in connection with
whisky-smuggling between Scotland and England, occurred after the
duty had been considerably lowered.&nbsp; This was a desperate
affray which took place on the night of Sunday, January 16th,
1825, at Rockcliffe Cross, five miles <span
class="pagenum">p. 227from Carlisle on the Wigton
road.&nbsp; One Edward Forster, officer of excise, was on duty
when he observed a man, whose name, it afterwards appeared, was
Charles Gillespie, a labourer, carrying a suspicious object, and
challenged him.&nbsp; This resulted in an encounter in which the
excise officer&rsquo;s head was badly cut open.&nbsp; Calling aid
of another labourer, who afterwards gave evidence, he remarked
that he thought the smuggler had almost done for him, but pursued
the man and fired upon him in the dark, with so good an aim that
he was mortally wounded, and presently died.&nbsp; It was a
dangerous thing in those times for an excise officer to do his
duty, and at the inquest held the coroner&rsquo;s jury returned a
verdict of &ldquo;Murder&rdquo;; the men who formed the jury
being doubtless drawn from a class entirely in sympathy with
smuggling, and possibly engaged in it themselves.&nbsp; Forster,
evidently expectant of that verdict, did not present himself, and
was probably transferred by his superiors to some post far
distant.&nbsp; There the affair ends.
About the same time, on the Carlisle and Wigton road, two
preventive men at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning met a man
carrying a load, which, when examined, proved to be a keg of
spirits.&nbsp; Two other men then came up and bludgeoned the
officers, one of whom dropped his cutlass; whereupon a smuggler
picked it up, and, attacking him vigorously, cut him over the
head.&nbsp; The smugglers then all escaped, leaving behind them
two bladders containing eight gallons of whisky.

<span
class="smcap">Some Smugglers&rsquo; Tricks and
Evasions&mdash;Modern
Tobacco-Smuggling&mdash;Silks and
Lace&mdash;A Dog
Detective&mdash;Leghorn
Hats&mdash;Foreign Watches
The tricks practised by smugglers
other than those daring and resourceful fellows who risked life,
limb, and liberty in conflict with the elements and the
preventive service, may form, in the narration, an amusing
chapter.&nbsp; Smugglers of this kind may be divided, roughly,
into three classes.&nbsp; Firstly, we have the ingeniously
evasive trade importer in bulk, who resorts to false declarations
and deceptive packing and labelling, for the purpose of entering
his merchandise duty-free.&nbsp; Secondly, we have the sailors,
the firemen of ocean-going steamers, and other persons of like
classes, who smuggle tobacco and spirits, not necessarily to a
commercial end, in considerable quantities; and thirdly, there
are those enterprising holiday-makers and travellers for pleasure
who cannot resist the sport.
We read in The Times of 1816 that, among the many
expedients at that time practised for smuggling goods into
France, the following scheme <span
class="pagenum">p. 229of introducing merchandise into
Dieppe had some dexterity.&nbsp; Large stone bottles were
procured, and, the bottoms being knocked off, they were then
filled with cotton stockings and thread lace.&nbsp; A false
bottom was fixed, and, to avoid suspicion, the mouth of each
bottle was left open.&nbsp; Any inquiries were met with the
statement that the bottles were going to the spirit merchant, to
be refilled.




This evasion was successfully carried on until a young man
from Brighton ventured on too heavy a speculation.&nbsp; He
filled his bottle with ten dozen stockings, which so weighted it
that the bottom came off, disclosing the contents.
Ingenuity worthy of a better cause is the characteristic of
modern types of smugglers.&nbsp; A constant battle of wits
between them and the custom-house officers is in progress at all
ports of entry; and the fortunes of either side may be followed
with much interest.
One of the most ingenious of such tricks was that of the
trader who was importing French kid-gloves.&nbsp; He caused them
to be despatched in two cases; one, containing only right-hand
gloves, to Folkestone, the other, left-hand only, to
London.&nbsp; Being at the time dutiable articles, and the
consignee refusing to pay the duty, the two cases were
confiscated and their contents in due course sold at
auction.&nbsp; No one has a use for odd gloves, and these
oddments accordingly in each case realised the merest trifle; but
the purchaser&mdash;who was of course the consignee
himself&mdash;netted <span
class="pagenum">p. 230a very considerable profit over the
transaction.&nbsp; The abolition of duty on such articles has,
however, rendered a modern repetition of the trick
unnecessary.&nbsp; Nor is it any longer likely that foreign
watches find their way to these shores in the old time-honoured
style&mdash;i.e. hung in leather bags round the persons of
unassuming travellers.
Such an one, smuggling an unusual number across from Holland,
calculated upon the average passage of twenty-four hours, and
reckoned he could, for once in a way, endure that spell of
waiting and walking about deck without lying down.&nbsp; He could
not, as a matter of fact, on account of the watches, afford to
lie down.&nbsp; To his dismay, the vessel, midway of the passage,
encountered a dense fog, and had occasionally to stop or slow
down; and, in the end, it was a forty-eight hours&rsquo;
passage.&nbsp; The unfortunate smuggler could not endure so much,
and was obliged to disclose his treasure.&nbsp; So the Revenue
scored heavily on that occasion.
Tobacco is still largely smuggled, and is, in fact, the
foremost article so treated to-day; the very heavy duty, not less
than five times its value, forming a great, and readily
understood, temptation.&nbsp; Perhaps the most notable attempt in
modern times to smuggle tobacco in bulk was that discovered in
1881.
The custom-house staff in London had for some time before that
date become familiar with warning letters sent anonymously,
hinting that great quantities of tobacco were continually being
p. 231conveyed
into England from Rotterdam without paying duty, but for a while
little notice was taken of these communications; until at length
they grew so definite that the officials had no choice but to
inquire.&nbsp; Detective officers were accordingly despatched to
Rotterdam, to watch the proceedings there, and duly observed the
packing of two large marine boilers with tobacco, by hydraulic
pressure.&nbsp; They were then shipped aboard a steamer and taken
to London, whence they were placed upon the railway at
King&rsquo;s Cross, for delivery in the north.&nbsp; A great deal
of secret manoeuvring by the custom-house officials and the
police resulted in both boilers being seized in London and those
responsible for them being secured.&nbsp; It was then discovered
that they were only dummy boilers, made expressly for smuggling
traffic; and it was further thought that this was by no means the
first journey they had made.&nbsp; The parties to this
transaction were fined close upon five thousand pounds, and the
consignment was confiscated.
To conceal tobacco in hollow loaves of bread, especially made
and baked for this purpose, was a common practice, and one not
altogether unknown nowadays; while the coal-bunkers, the
engine-rooms, and the hundred and one odd corners among the iron
plates and girders of modern steamships afford hiding-places not
seldom resorted to.&nbsp; The customs officers, who board every
vessel entering port, of course discover many of these
caches, but it is not to be <span
class="pagenum">p. 232supposed that more than a percentage
of them are found.
Smuggled cigars are to-day a mere commonplace of the ordinary
custom-house officer&rsquo;s experience with private travellers,
and no doubt a great quantity find a secret passage through, in
the trading way.&nbsp; For some years there was a considerable
import of broomsticks into England from the Continent, and little
or no comment was made upon the curious fact of it being worth
while to import so inexpensive an article, which could equally
well be made here.&nbsp; But the mystery was suddenly dispelled
one day when two clerks in a customs warehouse, wearied of a dull
afternoon, set to the amusement of playing single-stick with two
of these imported broomsticks.&nbsp; No sooner did one broomstick
smite upon another in this friendly encounter than they both
broke in half, liberating a plentiful shower of very excellent
cigars, which had been secreted in the hollowed staves.
Silks formed an important item in the smugglers&rsquo; trade,
and even the gentlemen of that day unconsciously contributed to
it, by the use of bandana handkerchiefs, greatly affected by that
snuff-taking generation.&nbsp; Huskisson, a thoroughgoing
advocate of Free Trade, was addressing the House of Commons on
one occasion and declaring that the only possible way to stop
smuggling was to abolish, or at any rate to greatly reduce, the
duties; when he dramatically instanced the evasions and floutings
of the laws.&nbsp; &ldquo;Honourable <span
class="pagenum">p. 233members of this House are well aware
that bandana handkerchiefs are prohibited by law, and yet,&rdquo;
he continued, drawing one from his pocket, while the House
laughed loud with delight, &ldquo;I have no doubt there is hardly
a gentleman here who has not got a bandana
handkerchief.&rdquo;
Lace-smuggling, of course, exercised great fascination for the
ladies, who&mdash;women being generally lacking in the moral
sense, or possessing it only in the partial and perverted manner
in which it is owned by infants&mdash;very rarely could resist
the temptation to secrete some on their way home from foreign
parts.&nbsp; The story is told how a lady who had a smuggled lace
veil of great value in her possession grew very nervous of being
able to carry it through, and imparted her anxiety to a gentleman
at the hotel dinner.&nbsp; He offered to take charge of it, as,
being a bachelor, no one was in the least likely to suspect him
of secreting such an article.&nbsp; But, in the very act of
accepting his offer, she chanced to observe a saturnine smile
spreading over the countenance of the waiter at her elbow.&nbsp;
She instantly suspected a spy, and secretly altered her plans,
causing the veil to be sewn up in the back of her husband&rsquo;s
waistcoat.
The precaution proved to be a necessary one, for the luggage
of the unfortunate bachelor was mercilessly overhauled at every
customs station on the remainder of the journey.
Among the many ruses practised upon the preventive men, who,
as the butts of innumerable evasive false-pretences, must have
been experts p.
234in the ways of practical jokes, was that of the
pretended drunken smuggler.&nbsp; To divert attention from any
pursuit of the main body of the tub-carrying gang, one of their
number would be detailed to stagger along, as though under the
influence of drink, in a different direction, with a couple of
tubs slung over his shoulders.&nbsp; It was a very excellently
effective trick, but had the obvious disadvantage of working only
once at any one given station.&nbsp; It was the fashion to
describe the preventive men as fools, but they were not such
crass fools as all that, to be taken in twice by the same simple
dodge.
The solitary and apparently intoxicated tub-carrier would lead
the pursuers a little way and would then allow himself easily to
be caught, but would then make a desperate and prolonged
resistance in defence of his tubs.&nbsp; At last, overpowered and
the tubs taken from him, and himself escorted to the nearest
blockade-station, the tubs themselves would be examined&mdash;and
would generally be found to contain only sea-water!
The customs men, however, were not without their own bright
ideas.&nbsp; The service would scarcely have been barren of
imagination unless it were recruited from a specially selected
levy of dunderheads.&nbsp; But it was an exceptionally brilliant
officer who hit upon the notion of training a puppy for
discovering those places where the smugglers had, as a temporary
expedient, hidden their spirit-tubs.&nbsp; It would often happen
that a successful run ended at the beach, and that opportunities
p. 235for
conveying the cargo inland had to be waited upon.&nbsp; It would,
therefore, be buried in the shingle, or in holes dug in the sands
at low water, until a safe opportunity occurred.&nbsp; The
customs staff knew this perfectly well, but they necessarily
lacked the knowledge of the exact spots where these stores had
been made.




The exceptionally imaginative customs officer in question
trained a terrier pup to the business of scenting them by the
cunning method of bringing the creature up with an acquired taste
for alcohol.&nbsp; This he did by mixing the pup&rsquo;s food
with spirits, and allowing it to take no food that was not so
flavoured.&nbsp; Two things resulted from this novel treatment:
the dog&rsquo;s growth was stunted, and it grew up with such a
liking for spirits that it would take nothing not freely laced
with whisky, rum, gin, or brandy.
The plan of operations with a dog educated into these vicious
tastes was simple.&nbsp; When his master found a favourable
opportunity for strolling along the shore, in search of buried
kegs, the dog, having been deprived of his food the day before,
was taken.&nbsp; When poor hungry Tray came to one of these
spots, the animal&rsquo;s keen and trained scent instantly
detected it, and he would at once begin scratching and barking
like mad.
The smugglers were not long in solving the mystery of their
secret hoards being all at once so successfully located; and, all
too soon for the Revenue, a well-aimed shot from the cliffs
presently cut the dog&rsquo;s career short.
p.
236&ldquo;Perhaps the oddest form of the smuggling carried
on in later times,&rdquo; says a writer in an old magazine,
&ldquo;was a curious practice in vogue between Calais and Dover
about 1819&ndash;20.&nbsp; This, however, was rather an open and
well-known technical evasion of the customs dues than actual
smuggling.&nbsp; The fashion at that time came in of ladies
wearing Leghorn hats and bonnets of enormous dimensions.&nbsp;
They were huge, strong plaits, nearly circular, and commonly
about a yard in diameter; and they sold in England at from two to
three guineas, and sometimes even more, apiece.&nbsp; A heavy
duty was laid upon them, amounting to nearly half their
value.
It is a well-known concession, made by the custom-houses of
various countries, that wearing-apparel in use is not liable to
duty, and herein lay the opportunity of those who were
financially interested in the import of Leghorn plaits.&nbsp; A
dealer in them hired, at a low figure, a numerous company of
women and girls of the poorest class to voyage daily from Dover
to Calais and back, and entered into a favourable contract with
the owners of one of the steamers for season-tickets for the
whole band of them at low rates.&nbsp; The sight of these women
leaving the town in the morning with the most deplorable headgear
and returning in the evening gloriously arrayed, so far as their
heads were concerned, was for some few years a familiar and
amusing one to the people of Dover.
Another ingenious evasion was that long <a
name="page237">p. 237practised
by the Swiss importers of watches at the time when watches also
were subject to duty.&nbsp; An ad valorem duty was placed
upon them, which was arrived at by the importers making a
declaration of their value.&nbsp; In order to prevent the value
being fixed too low, and the Revenue being consequently
defrauded, the Government had the right of buying any goods they
chose, at the prices declared.&nbsp; This was by no means a
disregarded right, for the authorities did frequently, in
suspicious cases, exercise it, and bought considerable
consignments of goods, which were afterwards disposed of by
auction, at well-known custom-house sales.
The Swiss makers and importers of watches managed to do a
pretty good deal of business with the customs as an unwilling
partner, and they did it in a perfectly legitimate way; although
a way not altogether without suspicion of sharp practice.&nbsp;
They would follow consignments of goods declared at ordinary
prices with others of exactly similar quality, entered at the
very lowest possible price, consistent with the making of a
trading profit; and the customs officials, noting the glaring
discrepancy, would exercise their rights and buy the cheaper
lots, thinking to cause the importers a severe loss and thus give
them a greatly needed lesson.&nbsp; The watch-manufacturers
really desired nothing better, and were cheerfully prepared to
learn many such lessons; for they thus secured an immediate
purchaser, for cash, and so greatly increased their
turnover.&nbsp; Other folks incidentally <a
name="page238">p. 238benefited,
for goods sold at customs auctions rarely ever fetched their real
value: there were too many keenly interested middlemen about for
that to be permitted.&nbsp; Thus, an excellent watch only, as a
rule, to be bought for from &pound;14 to &pound;15, could on
these occasions often be purchased for &pound;10.&nbsp; Naturally
enough, the proprietors of watch and jewellery businesses were
the chief bidders at these auctions; and, equally naturally, they
usually found means to keep down the prices to themselves, while
carefully ensuring that private bidders should be artfully run
up.

<span

Preventive Water-Guard and the Coastguard&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Official Return of Seizures&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Estimated Loss to the Revenue in
1831&mdash;The Sham Smuggler of the
Seaside&mdash;The Modern
Coastguard
The early coastguardmen had a great
deal of popular feeling to contend with.&nbsp; When the
coast-blockade was broken up in 1831, and the &ldquo;Preventive
Water-Guard,&rdquo; as this new body was styled, was formed,
officers and men alike found the greatest difficulty in obtaining
lodgings.&nbsp; No one would let houses or rooms to the men whose
business it was to prevent smuggling, and thus incidentally to
take away the excellent livelihood the fisherfolk and
longshoremen were earning.&nbsp; Thus, the earliest stations of
the coastguard were formed chiefly out of old hulks and other
vessels condemned for sea-going purposes, but quite sound, and
indeed, often peculiarly comfortable as residences, moored
permanently in sheltered creeks, or hauled up, high and dry, on
beaches that afforded the best of outlooks upon the sea.
Very few of these primitive coastguard stations <a
name="page240">p. 240are now
left.&nbsp; Their place has been pretty generally taken by the
neat, if severely unornamental, stations, generally whitewashed,
and enclosed within a compound-wall, with which summer visitors
to our coasts are familiar.&nbsp; And the old-time prejudice
against the men has had plenty of time to die away during the
eighty years or so in which the coastguard service has
existed.&nbsp; There are still, however, some eleven or twelve
old hulks in use as coastguard stations; principally in the
estuaries of the Thames and Medway.
The Preventive Water-Guard, from which the existing coastguard
service was developed, was not only the old coast-blockade
reorganised, but was an extension of it from the shores of
Hampshire, Sussex, Kent, and Essex, to the entire coast-line of
the United Kingdom.&nbsp; It was manned by sailors from the Royal
Navy, and the stations were commanded by naval lieutenants.&nbsp;
Many of the martello towers that had been built at regular
intervals along the shores of Kent and Sussex, and some few in
Suffolk, in or about 1805, when the terror of foreign invasion
was acute, were used for these early coastguard purposes.
That the preventive service did not prevent, and did not at
first even seriously interfere with, smuggling, was the
contention of many well-informed people, with whom the Press
generally sided.&nbsp; The coast-blockade, too, was&mdash;perhaps
unjustly&mdash;said to be altogether inefficient; and was further
said, truly enough, to be ruinously costly.&nbsp; Controversy was
bitter on these matters.&nbsp; <span
class="pagenum">p. 241In January 1825 The Times
recorded the entry of the revenue cutter, Hawke, into
Portsmouth, after a cruise in which she had chased and failed to
capture, owing to heavy weather, a smuggling lugger which
successfully ran seven hundred kegs of spirits.&nbsp; To this
item of news Lieutenant J. F. Tompson, of H.M.S.
Ramillies, commanding the coast-blockade at Lancing, took
exception, and wrote to The Times a violent letter,
complaining of the statements, and saying that they were
absolutely untrue.&nbsp; To this The Times replied, with
considerable acerbity, on February 3rd, that the statement was
true and the lieutenant&rsquo;s assertions unwarranted.&nbsp; The
newspaper then proceeded to &ldquo;rub it in&rdquo; vigorously:
&ldquo;There is nothing more ridiculous, in the eyes of those who
live upon our sea-coasts, than to witness the tender
sensibilities of officers employed upon the coast-blockade
whenever a statement is made that a smuggler has succeeded in
landing his cargo; as though they formed a part of the most
perfect system that can be established for the suppression of
smuggling.&nbsp; Now be it known to all England that this is a
gross attempt at humbug.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all the unceasing
vigilance of the officers and men employed, smuggling is carried
on all along the coast, from Deal to Cornwall, to as great a
degree as the public require.&nbsp; Any attempt to smuggle
this Fact may answer the
purpose of a party, or a particular system, but it will never
obtain belief.
&ldquo;It was only a few days since that a party <a
name="page242">p. 242of
coast-blockade men (we believe belonging to the Tower, No. 61)
made common cause with the smugglers, and they walked off
altogether!&rdquo;
Exactly!&nbsp; The sheer madness of the Government in
maintaining the extraordinary high duties, and of adding always
another force to existing services, designed to suppress the
smugglers&rsquo; trade, was sufficiently evident to all who would
not refuse to see.&nbsp; When commodities in great demand with
all classes were weighted with duties so heavy that few persons
could afford to purchase those that had passed through His
Majesty&rsquo;s Custom-houses, two things might have been
foreseen: that the regularised imports would, under the most
favourable circumstances, inevitably decrease; and that the
smuggling which had already been notoriously increasing by leaps
and bounds for a century past would be still further encouraged
to supply those articles at a cheap rate, which the
Government&rsquo;s policy had rendered unattainable by the
majority of people.
An account printed by order of the House of Commons in the
beginning of 1825 gave details of all customable commodities
seized during the last three years by the various establishments
formed for the prevention of smuggling: the Coastguard, or
Preventive Water-guard; the Riding-officers; and the revenue
cruisers and ships of war.
In that period the following articles were seized and dealt
with:

The produce of all these articles sold was &pound;282,541
8s. 5&frac34;d.; showing a loss to the nation, in
attempting during that period to suppress smuggling, of
considerably over one million and three quarters sterling.
This return of seizures provides an imposing array of figures,
but, amazing as those figures are by themselves, they would be
still more so if it were possible to place beside them an exact
return of the goods successfully run, in spite of blockades <a
name="page244">p. 244and
preventive services.&nbsp; Then we should see these figures fade
into insignificance beside the enormous bulk of goods that came
into the country and paid no dues.
Some very startling figures are available by which the
enormous amount of smuggling effected for generations may be
guessed.&nbsp; It would be possible to prepare a tabulated form
from the various reports of the Board of Customs, setting forth
the relation between duty-paid goods and the estimated value of
smuggled commodities during a term of years, but as this work is
scarce designed to fill the place of a statistical abstract, I
will forbear.&nbsp; A few illuminating items, it may be, will
suffice.
Thus in 1743 it was calculated that the annual average import
of tea through the legitimate channels was 650,000 lb.; but that
the total consumption was three times this amount.&nbsp; One
Dutch house alone was known to illegally import an annual weight
of 500,000 lb.
An even greater amount of spirit-smuggling may legitimately be
deduced from the perusal of the foregoing pages, and, although in
course of time considerably abated, as the coastguard and other
organisations settled down to their work of prevention and
detection, it remained to a late date of very large
proportions.&nbsp; Thus the official customs report for 1831
placed the loss to the Revenue on smuggled goods at
&pound;800,000 annually.&nbsp; To this amount the item of French
brandy contributed &pound;500,000.&nbsp; The annual cost of
protecting p.
245the Revenue (excise, customs, and preventive service)
was at the same time between &pound;700,000 and
&pound;800,000.
An interesting detailed statement of the contraband trade in
spirits from Roscoff, one of the Brittany ports, shows that, two
years later than the above, from March 15th to 17th, 1833, there
were shipped to England, per smuggling craft, 850 tubs of brandy;
and between April 13th and 20th in the same year 750 tubs; that
is to say, 6,400 gallons in little more than one month.&nbsp; And
although Roscoff was a prominent port in this trade, it was but
one of several.
So late as 1840, forty-eight per cent. of the French silks
brought into this country were said to have paid no duty; and for
years afterwards silk-smugglers, swathed apoplectically in
contraband of this description, formed the early steamship
companies&rsquo; most regular patrons.
The seaside holiday-maker of that age was an easy prey of
pretended smugglers, cunning rascals who traded upon that most
wide-spread of human failings, the love of a bargain, no matter
how illegitimately it may be procured.&nbsp; The lounger on the
seaside parades of that time was certain, sooner or later, to be
approached by a mysterious figure with an indefinable air of
mystery and a semi-nautical rig, who, with many careful glances
to right and left, and in a hoarse whisper behind a secretive
hand, told a tale of smuggled brandy or cigars, watches or
silks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not &rsquo;arf the price you&rsquo;d pay for
&rsquo;em in the shops, guv&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; the <a
name="page246">p. 246shameless
impostor would say, producing a bundle of cigars, &ldquo;but the
real thing; better than them wot most of the shops keep.&nbsp; I
see you&rsquo;re a gent. as knows a good smoke.&nbsp; You shall
&rsquo;ave &rsquo;em&rdquo;&mdash;at some preposterously low
price.&nbsp; And generally the greenhorn did have them; finding,
when he came to smoke the genuine Flor de Cabbage he had bought,
that they would have been dear at any price.&nbsp; To that
complexion of mean fraud did the old smuggling traditions of
courage, adventure, and derring-do come at last!
The modern coastguard, known technically as the First Naval
Reserve, is still under Admiralty control, but proposals are, it
is understood, now afoot for entirely altering its status, and
for reorganising it as a purely civil force, under the orders of
the customs and excise authorities.&nbsp; At present the
coastguard establishment numbers some 4,200 officers and men, and
is understood to cost &pound;260,000 a year.&nbsp; It is not,
perhaps, generally understood that the coastguardman is really a
man-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s man, attached to a particular ship, and
liable at any moment of national emergency to be called to rejoin
his ship, and to proceed on active service.
It is not really to be supposed that the coastguard succeed in
entirely suppressing smuggling, even in our own times.&nbsp; Few
are the articles that are now subject to duty, and the temptation
is consequently not now very great.&nbsp; Also, the landing of
such goods as tea, tobacco, and spirits in bulk would readily be
detected; but smuggling <span
class="pagenum">p. 247of spirits and of tobacco in small
quantities is commercially remunerative while the duties are as
high as from 11s. to 17s. a gallon, and from
3s. 6d. to 5s. a pound in respect of tobacco
and cigars; while large quantities of that entirely modern
article, saccharine, on which there is a duty of one shilling and
threepence an ounce (with a minimum legal weight on import of
eleven pounds, designed to render clandestine traffic in it
difficult), must, in the very nature of things, be illegally
introduced.
That there will be a phenomenal increase of smuggling when the
inevitable happens and protection of the country&rsquo;s trade
against the foreigner is instituted, seems certain.&nbsp; It will
seem like old times come again.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
