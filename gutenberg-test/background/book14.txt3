Book 14                                           2 Chronicles

14:001:001 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,
                                                                  and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him
                                                                  exceedingly.

14:001:002 Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of
                                                                  thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every
                                                                  governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.

14:001:003 So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the
                                                                  high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of
                                                                  the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD
                                                                  had made in the wilderness.

14:001:004 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to
                                                                  the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched
                                                                  a tent for it at Jerusalem.

14:001:005 Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the
                                                                  son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the
                                                                  LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.

14:001:006 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the
                                                                  LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and
                                                                  offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.

14:001:007 In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him,
                                                                  Ask what I shall give thee.

14:001:008 And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto
                                                                  David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.

14:001:009 Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be
                                                                  established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the
                                                                  dust of the earth in multitude.

14:001:010 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come
                                                                  in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that
                                                                  is so great?

14:001:011 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and
                                                                  thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of
                                                                  thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast
                                                                  asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge
                                                                  my people, over whom I have made thee king:

14:001:012 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give
                                                                  thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings
                                                                  have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any
                                                                  after thee have the like.

14:001:013 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was
                                                                  at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the
                                                                  congregation, and reigned over Israel.

14:001:014 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a
                                                                  thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
                                                                  horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the
                                                                  king at Jerusalem.

14:001:015 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as
                                                                  stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are
                                                                  in the vale for abundance.

14:001:016 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
                                                                  the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

14:001:017 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot
                                                                  for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred
                                                                  and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of
                                                                  the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.

14:002:001 And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the
                                                                  LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

14:002:002 And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear
                                                                  burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and
                                                                  three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.

14:002:003 And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou
                                                                  didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to
                                                                  build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.

14:002:004 Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to
                                                                  dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and
                                                                  for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings
                                                                  morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
                                                                  and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an
                                                                  ordinance for ever to Israel.

14:002:005 And the house which I build is great: for great is our God
                                                                  above all gods.

14:002:006 But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and
                                                                  heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I
                                                                  should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before
                                                                  him?

14:002:007 Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in
                                                                  silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson,
                                                                  and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men
                                                                  that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my
                                                                  father did provide.

14:002:008 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of
                                                                  Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber
                                                                  in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy
                                                                  servants,

14:002:009 Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I
                                                                  am about to build shall be wonderful great.

14:002:010 And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut
                                                                  timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty
                                                                  thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of
                                                                  wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.

14:002:011 Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent
                                                                  to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath
                                                                  made thee king over them.

14:002:012 Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that
                                                                  made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise
                                                                  son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build
                                                                  an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

14:002:013 And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding,
                                                                  of Huram my father's,

14:002:014 The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was
                                                                  a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in
                                                                  brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue,
                                                                  and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of
                                                                  graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to
                                                                  him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord
                                                                  David thy father.

14:002:015 Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the
                                                                  wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his
                                                                  servants:

14:002:016 And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt
                                                                  need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa;
                                                                  and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.

14:002:017 And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land
                                                                  of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had
                                                                  numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty
                                                                  thousand and three thousand and six hundred.

14:002:018 And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers
                                                                  of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the
                                                                  mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set
                                                                  the people a work.

14:003:001 Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem
                                                                  in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his
                                                                  father, in the place that David had prepared in the
                                                                  threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

14:003:002 And he began to build in the second day of the second month,
                                                                  in the fourth year of his reign.

14:003:003 Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for
                                                                  the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after
                                                                  the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth
                                                                  twenty cubits.

14:003:004 And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length
                                                                  of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty
                                                                  cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he
                                                                  overlaid it within with pure gold.

14:003:005 And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he
                                                                  overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and
                                                                  chains.

14:003:006 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty:
                                                                  and the gold was gold of Parvaim.

14:003:007 He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the
                                                                  walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved
                                                                  cherubims on the walls.

14:003:008 And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was
                                                                  according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the
                                                                  breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine
                                                                  gold, amounting to six hundred talents.

14:003:009 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he
                                                                  overlaid the upper chambers with gold.

14:003:010 And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image
                                                                  work, and overlaid them with gold.

14:003:011 And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one
                                                                  wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall
                                                                  of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits,
                                                                  reaching to the wing of the other cherub.

14:003:012 And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to
                                                                  the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits
                                                                  also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.

14:003:013 The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty
                                                                  cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were
                                                                  inward.

14:003:014 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and
                                                                  fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.

14:003:015 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five
                                                                  cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of
                                                                  them was five cubits.

14:003:016 And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the
                                                                  heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and
                                                                  put them on the chains.

14:003:017 And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the
                                                                  right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of
                                                                  that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the
                                                                  left Boaz.

14:004:001 Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length
                                                                  thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits
                                                                  the height thereof.

14:004:002 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim,
                                                                  round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a
                                                                  line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

14:004:003 And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it
                                                                  round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about.
                                                                  Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.

14:004:004 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
                                                                  three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the
                                                                  south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set
                                                                  above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.

14:004:005 And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it
                                                                  like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies;
                                                                  and it received and held three thousand baths.

14:004:006 He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and
                                                                  five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered
                                                                  for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was
                                                                  for the priests to wash in.

14:004:007 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form,
                                                                  and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five
                                                                  on the left.

14:004:008 He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five
                                                                  on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an
                                                                  hundred basons of gold.

14:004:009 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great
                                                                  court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them
                                                                  with brass.

14:004:010 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over
                                                                  against the south.

14:004:011 And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And
                                                                  Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon
                                                                  for the house of God;

14:004:012 To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters
                                                                  which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths
                                                                  to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the
                                                                  top of the pillars;

14:004:013 And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of
                                                                  pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the
                                                                  chapiters which were upon the pillars.

14:004:014 He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;

14:004:015 One sea, and twelve oxen under it.

14:004:016 The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all
                                                                  their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon
                                                                  for the house of the LORD of bright brass.

14:004:017 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
                                                                  ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.

14:004:018 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for
                                                                  the weight of the brass could not be found out.

14:004:019 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of
                                                                  God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the
                                                                  shewbread was set;

14:004:020 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should
                                                                  burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;

14:004:021 And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of
                                                                  gold, and that perfect gold;

14:004:022 And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the
                                                                  censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner
                                                                  doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the
                                                                  house of the temple, were of gold.

14:005:001 Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD
                                                                  was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David
                                                                  his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and
                                                                  all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house
                                                                  of God.

14:005:002 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
                                                                  of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
                                                                  Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of
                                                                  the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.

14:005:003 Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the
                                                                  king in the feast which was in the seventh month.

14:005:004 And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the
                                                                  ark.

14:005:005 And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the
                                                                  congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the
                                                                  tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.

14:005:006 Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that
                                                                  were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and
                                                                  oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.

14:005:007 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
                                                                  unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy
                                                                  place, even under the wings of the cherubims:

14:005:008 For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of
                                                                  the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves
                                                                  thereof above.

14:005:009 And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the
                                                                  staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were
                                                                  not seen without. And there it is unto this day.

14:005:010 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses
                                                                  put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the
                                                                  children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

14:005:011 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
                                                                  holy place: (for all the priests that were present were
                                                                  sanctified, and did not then wait by course:

14:005:012 Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph,
                                                                  of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren,
                                                                  being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries
                                                                  and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them
                                                                  an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)

14:005:013 It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as
                                                                  one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking
                                                                  the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the
                                                                  trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised
                                                                  the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for
                                                                  ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the
                                                                  house of the LORD;

14:005:014 So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of
                                                                  the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of
                                                                  God.

14:006:001 Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in
                                                                  the thick darkness.

14:006:002 But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place
                                                                  for thy dwelling for ever.

14:006:003 And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole
                                                                  congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel
                                                                  stood.

14:006:004 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with
                                                                  his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my
                                                                  father David, saying,

14:006:005 Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land
                                                                  of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to
                                                                  build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose
                                                                  I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:

14:006:006 But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and
                                                                  have chosen David to be over my people Israel.

14:006:007 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house
                                                                  for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

14:006:008 But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in
                                                                  thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in
                                                                  that it was in thine heart:

14:006:009 Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son
                                                                  which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the
                                                                  house for my name.

14:006:010 The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath
                                                                  spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and
                                                                  am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have
                                                                  built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

14:006:011 And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the
                                                                  LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.

14:006:012 And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of
                                                                  all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:

14:006:013 For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long,
                                                                  and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it
                                                                  in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled
                                                                  down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and
                                                                  spread forth his hands toward heaven.

14:006:014 And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in
                                                                  the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and
                                                                  shewest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with
                                                                  all their hearts:

14:006:015 Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that
                                                                  which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and
                                                                  hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.

14:006:016 Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant
                                                                  David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying,
                                                                  There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the
                                                                  throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their
                                                                  way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.

14:006:017 Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified,
                                                                  which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.

14:006:018 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold,
                                                                  heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much
                                                                  less this house which I have built!

14:006:019 Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to
                                                                  his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and
                                                                  the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:

14:006:020 That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night,
                                                                  upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put
                                                                  thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant
                                                                  prayeth toward this place.

14:006:021 Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and
                                                                  of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place:
                                                                  hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when
                                                                  thou hearest, forgive.

14:006:022 If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon
                                                                  him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in
                                                                  this house;

14:006:023 Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by
                                                                  requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own
                                                                  head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according
                                                                  to his righteousness.

14:006:024 And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,
                                                                  because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and
                                                                  confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee
                                                                  in this house;

14:006:025 Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy
                                                                  people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou
                                                                  gavest to them and to their fathers.

14:006:026 When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
                                                                  have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place,
                                                                  and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost
                                                                  afflict them;

14:006:027 Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy
                                                                  servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them
                                                                  the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy
                                                                  land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an
                                                                  inheritance.

14:006:028 If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if
                                                                  there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if
                                                                  their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land;
                                                                  whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:

14:006:029 Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of
                                                                  any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall
                                                                  know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth
                                                                  his hands in this house:

14:006:030 Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive,
                                                                  and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose
                                                                  heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the
                                                                  children of men:)

14:006:031 That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they
                                                                  live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.

14:006:032 Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people
                                                                  Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name's
                                                                  sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they
                                                                  come and pray in this house;

14:006:033 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place,
                                                                  and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for;
                                                                  that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee,
                                                                  as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which
                                                                  I have built is called by thy name.

14:006:034 If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way
                                                                  that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this
                                                                  city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built
                                                                  for thy name;

14:006:035 Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their
                                                                  supplication, and maintain their cause.

14:006:036 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth
                                                                  not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over
                                                                  before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a
                                                                  land far off or near;

14:006:037 Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are
                                                                  carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of
                                                                  their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss,
                                                                  and have dealt wickedly;

14:006:038 If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their
                                                                  soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried
                                                                  them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest
                                                                  unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast
                                                                  chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:

14:006:039 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place,
                                                                  their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their
                                                                  cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee.

14:006:040 Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let
                                                                  thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this
                                                                  place.

14:006:041 Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou,
                                                                  and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be
                                                                  clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in
                                                                  goodness.

14:006:042 O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember
                                                                  the mercies of David thy servant.

14:007:001 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came
                                                                  down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the
                                                                  sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.

14:007:002 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD,
                                                                  because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.

14:007:003 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came
                                                                  down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed
                                                                  themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement,
                                                                  and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good;
                                                                  for his mercy endureth for ever.

14:007:004 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the
                                                                  LORD.

14:007:005 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two
                                                                  thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so
                                                                  the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.

14:007:006 And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with
                                                                  instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had
                                                                  made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever,
                                                                  when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded
                                                                  trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.

14:007:007 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was
                                                                  before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt
                                                                  offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the
                                                                  brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive
                                                                  the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.

14:007:008 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and
                                                                  all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the
                                                                  entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.

14:007:009 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they
                                                                  kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast
                                                                  seven days.

14:007:010 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he
                                                                  sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart
                                                                  for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to
                                                                  Solomon, and to Israel his people.

14:007:011 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's
                                                                  house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the
                                                                  house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously
                                                                  effected.

14:007:012 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him,
                                                                  I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself
                                                                  for an house of sacrifice.

14:007:013 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the
                                                                  locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my
                                                                  people;

14:007:014 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble
                                                                  themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their
                                                                  wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive
                                                                  their sin, and will heal their land.

14:007:015 Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the
                                                                  prayer that is made in this place.

14:007:016 For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name
                                                                  may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be
                                                                  there perpetually.

14:007:017 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy
                                                                  father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded
                                                                  thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;

14:007:018 Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I
                                                                  have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not
                                                                  fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.

14:007:019 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my
                                                                  commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and
                                                                  serve other gods, and worship them;

14:007:020 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I
                                                                  have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for
                                                                  my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a
                                                                  proverb and a byword among all nations.

14:007:021 And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to
                                                                  every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath
                                                                  the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?

14:007:022 And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of
                                                                  their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of
                                                                  Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and
                                                                  served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon
                                                                  them.

14:008:001 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein
                                                                  Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,

14:008:002 That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon
                                                                  built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.

14:008:003 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.

14:008:004 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store
                                                                  cities, which he built in Hamath.

14:008:005 Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether,
                                                                  fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;

14:008:006 And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and
                                                                  all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and
                                                                  all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in
                                                                  Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.

14:008:007 As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the
                                                                  Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
                                                                  Jebusites, which were not of Israel,

14:008:008 But of their children, who were left after them in the land,
                                                                  whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon
                                                                  make to pay tribute until this day.

14:008:009 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for
                                                                  his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains,
                                                                  and captains of his chariots and horsemen.

14:008:010 And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two
                                                                  hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.

14:008:011 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city
                                                                  of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he
                                                                  said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of
                                                                  Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the
                                                                  LORD hath come.

14:008:012 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the
                                                                  altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,

14:008:013 Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the
                                                                  commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
                                                                  and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the
                                                                  feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in
                                                                  the feast of tabernacles.

14:008:014 And he appointed, according to the order of David his father,
                                                                  the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites
                                                                  to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests,
                                                                  as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their
                                                                  courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God
                                                                  commanded.

14:008:015 And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto
                                                                  the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning
                                                                  the treasures.

14:008:016 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
                                                                  foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was
                                                                  finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.

14:008:017 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side
                                                                  in the land of Edom.

14:008:018 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and
                                                                  servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the
                                                                  servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and
                                                                  fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.

14:009:001 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she
                                                                  came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a
                                                                  very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in
                                                                  abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to
                                                                  Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.

14:009:002 And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing
                                                                  hid from Solomon which he told her not.

14:009:003 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon,
                                                                  and the house that he had built,

14:009:004 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
                                                                  and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his
                                                                  cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he
                                                                  went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit
                                                                  in her.

14:009:005 And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard
                                                                  in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:

14:009:006 Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine
                                                                  eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness
                                                                  of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame
                                                                  that I heard.

14:009:007 Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which
                                                                  stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.

14:009:008 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set
                                                                  thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because
                                                                  thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore
                                                                  made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.

14:009:009 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,
                                                                  and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither
                                                                  was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king
                                                                  Solomon.

14:009:010 And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,
                                                                  which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and
                                                                  precious stones.

14:009:011 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of
                                                                  the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries
                                                                  for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land
                                                                  of Judah.

14:009:012 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
                                                                  whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto
                                                                  the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she
                                                                  and her servants.

14:009:013 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
                                                                  six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;

14:009:014 Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the
                                                                  kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and
                                                                  silver to Solomon.

14:009:015 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
                                                                  hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.

14:009:016 And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three
                                                                  hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put
                                                                  them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.

14:009:017 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
                                                                  it with pure gold.

14:009:018 And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of
                                                                  gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each
                                                                  side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the
                                                                  stays:

14:009:019 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
                                                                  upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any
                                                                  kingdom.

14:009:020 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and
                                                                  all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of
                                                                  pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted
                                                                  of in the days of Solomon.

14:009:021 For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of
                                                                  Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish
                                                                  bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

14:009:022 And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches
                                                                  and wisdom.

14:009:023 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon,
                                                                  to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.

14:009:024 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
                                                                  vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and
                                                                  mules, a rate year by year.

14:009:025 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots,
                                                                  and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot
                                                                  cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.

14:009:026 And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the
                                                                  land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.

14:009:027 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar
                                                                  trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains
                                                                  in abundance.

14:009:028 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of
                                                                  all lands.

14:009:029 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they
                                                                  not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the
                                                                  prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo
                                                                  the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?

14:009:030 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

14:009:031 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the
                                                                  city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his
                                                                  stead.

14:010:001 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel
                                                                  come to make him king.

14:010:002 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was
                                                                  in Egypt, whither he fled from the presence of Solomon the
                                                                  king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.

14:010:003 And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came
                                                                  and spake to Rehoboam, saying,

14:010:004 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou
                                                                  somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy
                                                                  yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.

14:010:005 And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days.
                                                                  And the people departed.

14:010:006 And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
                                                                  before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What
                                                                  counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?

14:010:007 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this
                                                                  people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they
                                                                  will be thy servants for ever.

14:010:008 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and
                                                                  took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him,
                                                                  that stood before him.

14:010:009 And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return
                                                                  answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease
                                                                  somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?

14:010:010 And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto
                                                                  him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto
                                                                  thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it
                                                                  somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My
                                                                  little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.

14:010:011 For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put
                                                                  more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I
                                                                  will chastise you with scorpions.

14:010:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third
                                                                  day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third
                                                                  day.

14:010:013 And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook
                                                                  the counsel of the old men,

14:010:014 And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying,
                                                                  My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my
                                                                  father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with
                                                                  scorpions.

14:010:015 So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was
                                                                  of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake
                                                                  by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of
                                                                  Nebat.

14:010:016 And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto
                                                                  them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have
                                                                  we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse:
                                                                  every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to
                                                                  thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.

14:010:017 But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of
                                                                  Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

14:010:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and
                                                                  the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.
                                                                  But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to
                                                                  flee to Jerusalem.

14:010:019 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

14:011:001 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the
                                                                  house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand
                                                                  chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that
                                                                  he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.

14:011:002 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God,
                                                                  saying,

14:011:003 Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to
                                                                  all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,

14:011:004 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against
                                                                  your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing
                                                                  is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and
                                                                  returned from going against Jeroboam.

14:011:005 And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence
                                                                  in Judah.

14:011:006 He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,

14:011:007 And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,

14:011:008 And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,

14:011:009 And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,

14:011:010 And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in
                                                                  Benjamin fenced cities.

14:011:011 And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them,
                                                                  and store of victual, and of oil and wine.

14:011:012 And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made
                                                                  them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.

14:011:013 And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel
                                                                  resorted to him out of all their coasts.

14:011:014 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and
                                                                  came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had
                                                                  cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the
                                                                  LORD:

14:011:015 And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the
                                                                  devils, and for the calves which he had made.

14:011:016 And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set
                                                                  their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem,
                                                                  to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.

14:011:017 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam
                                                                  the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they
                                                                  walked in the way of David and Solomon.

14:011:018 And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the
                                                                  son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the
                                                                  son of Jesse;

14:011:019 Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.

14:011:020 And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which
                                                                  bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.

14:011:021 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all
                                                                  his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and
                                                                  threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and
                                                                  threescore daughters.)

14:011:022 And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be
                                                                  ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.

14:011:023 And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children
                                                                  throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every
                                                                  fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he
                                                                  desired many wives.

14:012:001 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the
                                                                  kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of
                                                                  the LORD, and all Israel with him.

14:012:002 And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam
                                                                  Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they
                                                                  had transgressed against the LORD,

14:012:003 With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand
                                                                  horsemen: and the people were without number that came with
                                                                  him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the
                                                                  Ethiopians.

14:012:004 And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and
                                                                  came to Jerusalem.

14:012:005 Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes
                                                                  of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of
                                                                  Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have
                                                                  forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of
                                                                  Shishak.

14:012:006 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled
                                                                  themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.

14:012:007 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word
                                                                  of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled
                                                                  themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will
                                                                  grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured
                                                                  out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.

14:012:008 Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my
                                                                  service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.

14:012:009 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took
                                                                  away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures
                                                                  of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the
                                                                  shields of gold which Solomon had made.

14:012:010 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and
                                                                  committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that
                                                                  kept the entrance of the king's house.

14:012:011 And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the
                                                                  guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the
                                                                  guard chamber.

14:012:012 And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from
                                                                  him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in
                                                                  Judah things went well.

14:012:013 So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and
                                                                  reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he
                                                                  began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem,
                                                                  the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of
                                                                  Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was
                                                                  Naamah an Ammonitess.

14:012:014 And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the
                                                                  LORD.

14:012:015 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written
                                                                  in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer
                                                                  concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam
                                                                  and Jeroboam continually.

14:012:016 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
                                                                  city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.

14:013:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to
                                                                  reign over Judah.

14:013:002 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also
                                                                  was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was
                                                                  war between Abijah and Jeroboam.

14:013:003 And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men
                                                                  of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also
                                                                  set the battle in array against him with eight hundred
                                                                  thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.

14:013:004 And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount
                                                                  Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;

14:013:005 Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the
                                                                  kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his
                                                                  sons by a covenant of salt?

14:013:006 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son
                                                                  of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.

14:013:007 And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of
                                                                  Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the
                                                                  son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and
                                                                  could not withstand them.

14:013:008 And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the
                                                                  hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and
                                                                  there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for
                                                                  gods.

14:013:009 Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of
                                                                  Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the
                                                                  manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh
                                                                  to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the
                                                                  same may be a priest of them that are no gods.

14:013:010 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken
                                                                  him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the
                                                                  sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:

14:013:011 And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening
                                                                  burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set
                                                                  they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold
                                                                  with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the
                                                                  charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.

14:013:012 And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his
                                                                  priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O
                                                                  children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your
                                                                  fathers; for ye shall not prosper.

14:013:013 But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them:
                                                                  so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.

14:013:014 And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and
                                                                  behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded
                                                                  with the trumpets.

14:013:015 Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah
                                                                  shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all
                                                                  Israel before Abijah and Judah.

14:013:016 And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God
                                                                  delivered them into their hand.

14:013:017 And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so
                                                                  there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen
                                                                  men.

14:013:018 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time,
                                                                  and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon
                                                                  the LORD God of their fathers.

14:013:019 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,
                                                                  Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns
                                                                  thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.

14:013:020 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of
                                                                  Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.

14:013:021 But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat
                                                                  twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.

14:013:022 And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his
                                                                  sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.

14:014:001 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
                                                                  city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his
                                                                  days the land was quiet ten years.

14:014:002 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the
                                                                  LORD his God:

14:014:003 For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high
                                                                  places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:

14:014:004 And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and
                                                                  to do the law and the commandment.

14:014:005 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high
                                                                  places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.

14:014:006 And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest,
                                                                  and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given
                                                                  him rest.

14:014:007 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and
                                                                  make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the
                                                                  land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our
                                                                  God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every
                                                                  side. So they built and prospered.

14:014:008 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out
                                                                  of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that
                                                                  bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore
                                                                  thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.

14:014:009 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an
                                                                  host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and
                                                                  came unto Mareshah.

14:014:010 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in
                                                                  array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.

14:014:011 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is
                                                                  nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them
                                                                  that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on
                                                                  thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD,
                                                                  thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.

14:014:012 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;
                                                                  and the Ethiopians fled.

14:014:013 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto
                                                                  Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not
                                                                  recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD,
                                                                  and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.

14:014:014 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear
                                                                  of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities;
                                                                  for there was exceeding much spoil in them.

14:014:015 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep
                                                                  and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.

14:015:001 And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:

14:015:002 And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me,
                                                                  Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while
                                                                  ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you;
                                                                  but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.

14:015:003 Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God,
                                                                  and without a teaching priest, and without law.

14:015:004 But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of
                                                                  Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.

14:015:005 And in those times there was no peace to him that went out,
                                                                  nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the
                                                                  inhabitants of the countries.

14:015:006 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God
                                                                  did vex them with all adversity.

14:015:007 Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for
                                                                  your work shall be rewarded.

14:015:008 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the
                                                                  prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols
                                                                  out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the
                                                                  cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the
                                                                  altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.

14:015:009 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with
                                                                  them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they
                                                                  fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the
                                                                  LORD his God was with him.

14:015:010 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third
                                                                  month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

14:015:011 And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil
                                                                  which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand
                                                                  sheep.

14:015:012 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their
                                                                  fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;

14:015:013 That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be
                                                                  put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.

14:015:014 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with
                                                                  shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.

14:015:015 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with
                                                                  all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and
                                                                  he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.

14:015:016 And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he
                                                                  removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in
                                                                  a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt
                                                                  it at the brook Kidron.

14:015:017 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:
                                                                  nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.

14:015:018 And he brought into the house of God the things that his
                                                                  father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated,
                                                                  silver, and gold, and vessels.

14:015:019 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of
                                                                  the reign of Asa.

14:016:001 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king
                                                                  of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the
                                                                  intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of
                                                                  Judah.

14:016:002 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of
                                                                  the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to
                                                                  Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,

14:016:003 There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my
                                                                  father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and
                                                                  gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he
                                                                  may depart from me.

14:016:004 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
                                                                  his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon,
                                                                  and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.

14:016:005 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off
                                                                  building of Ramah, and let his work cease.

14:016:006 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the
                                                                  stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was
                                                                  building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.

14:016:007 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah,
                                                                  and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of
                                                                  Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the
                                                                  host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.

14:016:008 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very
                                                                  many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on
                                                                  the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.

14:016:009 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole
                                                                  earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose
                                                                  heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly:
                                                                  therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.

14:016:010 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison
                                                                  house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing.
                                                                  And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.

14:016:011 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are
                                                                  written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

14:016:012 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased
                                                                  in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his
                                                                  disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.

14:016:013 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and
                                                                  fortieth year of his reign.

14:016:014 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made
                                                                  for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed
                                                                  which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices
                                                                  prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great
                                                                  burning for him.

14:017:001 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened
                                                                  himself against Israel.

14:017:002 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and
                                                                  set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of
                                                                  Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.

14:017:003 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the
                                                                  first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;

14:017:004 But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his
                                                                  commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.

14:017:005 Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all
                                                                  Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and
                                                                  honour in abundance.

14:017:006 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover
                                                                  he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.

14:017:007 Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes,
                                                                  even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to
                                                                  Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.

14:017:008 And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah,
                                                                  and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and
                                                                  Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them
                                                                  Elishama and Jehoram, priests.

14:017:009 And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the
                                                                  LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of
                                                                  Judah, and taught the people.

14:017:010 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the
                                                                  lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war
                                                                  against Jehoshaphat.

14:017:011 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and
                                                                  tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven
                                                                  thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven
                                                                  hundred he goats.

14:017:012 And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah
                                                                  castles, and cities of store.

14:017:013 And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men
                                                                  of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.

14:017:014 And these are the numbers of them according to the house of
                                                                  their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the
                                                                  chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred
                                                                  thousand.

14:017:015 And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two
                                                                  hundred and fourscore thousand.

14:017:016 And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly
                                                                  offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred
                                                                  thousand mighty men of valour.

14:017:017 And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him
                                                                  armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.

14:017:018 And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and
                                                                  fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.

14:017:019 These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in
                                                                  the fenced cities throughout all Judah.

14:018:001 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined
                                                                  affinity with Ahab.

14:018:002 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And
                                                                  Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the
                                                                  people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with
                                                                  him to Ramothgilead.

14:018:003 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
                                                                  Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I
                                                                  am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be
                                                                  with thee in the war.

14:018:004 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
                                                                  thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

14:018:005 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets
                                                                  four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to
                                                                  Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go
                                                                  up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.

14:018:006 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
                                                                  besides, that we might enquire of him?

14:018:007 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one
                                                                  man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for
                                                                  he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is
                                                                  Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the
                                                                  king say so.

14:018:008 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and
                                                                  said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.

14:018:009 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat
                                                                  either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they
                                                                  sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria;
                                                                  and all the prophets prophesied before them.

14:018:010 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,
                                                                  and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push
                                                                  Syria until they be consumed.

14:018:011 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
                                                                  Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into
                                                                  the hand of the king.

14:018:012 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him,
                                                                  saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the
                                                                  king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be
                                                                  like one of their's, and speak thou good.

14:018:013 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith,
                                                                  that will I speak.

14:018:014 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,
                                                                  Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I
                                                                  forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be
                                                                  delivered into your hand.

14:018:015 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee
                                                                  that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the
                                                                  LORD?

14:018:016 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the
                                                                  mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said,
                                                                  These have no master; let them return therefore every man to
                                                                  his house in peace.

14:018:017 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
                                                                  thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?

14:018:018 Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the
                                                                  LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven
                                                                  standing on his right hand and on his left.

14:018:019 And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that
                                                                  he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying
                                                                  after this manner, and another saying after that manner.

14:018:020 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
                                                                  said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him,
                                                                  Wherewith?

14:018:021 And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth
                                                                  of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him,
                                                                  and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.

14:018:022 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
                                                                  mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil
                                                                  against thee.

14:018:023 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote
                                                                  Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of
                                                                  the LORD from me to speak unto thee?

14:018:024 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou
                                                                  shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

14:018:025 Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him
                                                                  back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's
                                                                  son;

14:018:026 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
                                                                  and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of
                                                                  affliction, until I return in peace.

14:018:027 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath
                                                                  not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye
                                                                  people.

14:018:028 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
                                                                  up to Ramothgilead.

14:018:029 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
                                                                  myself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy
                                                                  robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went
                                                                  to the battle.

14:018:030 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the
                                                                  chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small
                                                                  or great, save only with the king of Israel.

14:018:031 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
                                                                  Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel.
                                                                  Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat
                                                                  cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to
                                                                  depart from him.

14:018:032 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots
                                                                  perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back
                                                                  again from pursuing him.

14:018:033 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king
                                                                  of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said
                                                                  to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me
                                                                  out of the host; for I am wounded.

14:018:034 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel
                                                                  stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the
                                                                  even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.

14:019:001 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in
                                                                  peace to Jerusalem.

14:019:002 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and
                                                                  said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and
                                                                  love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee
                                                                  from before the LORD.

14:019:003 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou
                                                                  hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared
                                                                  thine heart to seek God.

14:019:004 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again
                                                                  through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and
                                                                  brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.

14:019:005 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities
                                                                  of Judah, city by city,

14:019:006 And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not
                                                                  for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.

14:019:007 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed
                                                                  and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor
                                                                  respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.

14:019:008 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and
                                                                  of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for
                                                                  the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they
                                                                  returned to Jerusalem.

14:019:009 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of
                                                                  the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.

14:019:010 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that
                                                                  dwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and
                                                                  commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them
                                                                  that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come
                                                                  upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not
                                                                  trespass.

14:019:011 And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all
                                                                  matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the
                                                                  ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also
                                                                  the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously,
                                                                  and the LORD shall be with the good.

14:020:001 It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab,
                                                                  and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the
                                                                  Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.

14:020:002 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There
                                                                  cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on
                                                                  this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which
                                                                  is Engedi.

14:020:003 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and
                                                                  proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

14:020:004 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the
                                                                  LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek
                                                                  the LORD.

14:020:005 And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and
                                                                  Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,

14:020:006 And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in
                                                                  heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the
                                                                  heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so
                                                                  that none is able to withstand thee?

14:020:007 Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of
                                                                  this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed
                                                                  of Abraham thy friend for ever?

14:020:008 And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary
                                                                  therein for thy name, saying,

14:020:009 If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or
                                                                  pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy
                                                                  presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee
                                                                  in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.

14:020:010 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount
                                                                  Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came
                                                                  out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and
                                                                  destroyed them not;

14:020:011 Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of
                                                                  thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.

14:020:012 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might
                                                                  against this great company that cometh against us; neither
                                                                  know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.

14:020:013 And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones,
                                                                  their wives, and their children.

14:020:014 Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah,
                                                                  the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons
                                                                  of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the
                                                                  congregation;

14:020:015 And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of
                                                                  Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto
                                                                  you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great
                                                                  multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.

14:020:016 To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the
                                                                  cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook,
                                                                  before the wilderness of Jeruel.

14:020:017 Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves,
                                                                  stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O
                                                                  Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go
                                                                  out against them: for the LORD will be with you.

14:020:018 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground:
                                                                  and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the
                                                                  LORD, worshipping the LORD.

14:020:019 And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the
                                                                  children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of
                                                                  Israel with a loud voice on high.

14:020:020 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the
                                                                  wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood
                                                                  and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem;
                                                                  Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established;
                                                                  believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.

14:020:021 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed
                                                                  singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of
                                                                  holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise
                                                                  the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever.

14:020:022 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set
                                                                  ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount
                                                                  Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.

14:020:023 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the
                                                                  inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them:
                                                                  and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir,
                                                                  every one helped to destroy another.

14:020:024 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,
                                                                  they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead
                                                                  bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.

14:020:025 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the
                                                                  spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches
                                                                  with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped
                                                                  off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they
                                                                  were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.

14:020:026 And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley
                                                                  of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the
                                                                  name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah,
                                                                  unto this day.

14:020:027 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and
                                                                  Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem
                                                                  with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their
                                                                  enemies.

14:020:028 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and
                                                                  trumpets unto the house of the LORD.

14:020:029 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those
                                                                  countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against
                                                                  the enemies of Israel.

14:020:030 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him
                                                                  rest round about.

14:020:031 And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five
                                                                  years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and
                                                                  five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the
                                                                  daughter of Shilhi.

14:020:032 And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not
                                                                  from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.

14:020:033 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the
                                                                  people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their
                                                                  fathers.

14:020:034 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last,
                                                                  behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of
                                                                  Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.

14:020:035 And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
                                                                  Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:

14:020:036 And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to
                                                                  Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongaber.

14:020:037 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against
                                                                  Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with
                                                                  Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were
                                                                  broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

14:021:001 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with
                                                                  his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned
                                                                  in his stead.

14:021:002 And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and
                                                                  Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and
                                                                  Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of
                                                                  Israel.

14:021:003 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,
                                                                  and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the
                                                                  kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.

14:021:004 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he
                                                                  strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the
                                                                  sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.

14:021:005 Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign,
                                                                  and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

14:021:006 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did
                                                                  the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife:
                                                                  and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.

14:021:007 Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because
                                                                  of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he
                                                                  promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.

14:021:008 In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of
                                                                  Judah, and made themselves a king.

14:021:009 Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots
                                                                  with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites
                                                                  which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.

14:021:010 So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto
                                                                  this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his
                                                                  hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.

14:021:011 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and
                                                                  caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and
                                                                  compelled Judah thereto.

14:021:012 And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet,
                                                                  saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because
                                                                  thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father,
                                                                  nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,

14:021:013 But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast
                                                                  made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring,
                                                                  like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast
                                                                  slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better
                                                                  than thyself:

14:021:014 Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people,
                                                                  and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:

14:021:015 And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels,
                                                                  until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by
                                                                  day.

14:021:016 Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
                                                                  Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the
                                                                  Ethiopians:

14:021:017 And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried
                                                                  away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and
                                                                  his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son
                                                                  left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.

14:021:018 And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an
                                                                  incurable disease.

14:021:019 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of
                                                                  two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so
                                                                  he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for
                                                                  him, like the burning of his fathers.

14:021:020 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he
                                                                  reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being
                                                                  desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not
                                                                  in the sepulchres of the kings.

14:022:001 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son
                                                                  king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the
                                                                  Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the
                                                                  son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.

14:022:002 Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign,
                                                                  and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also
                                                                  was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.

14:022:003 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his
                                                                  mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.

14:022:004 Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house
                                                                  of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his
                                                                  father to his destruction.

14:022:005 He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the
                                                                  son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria
                                                                  at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.

14:022:006 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds
                                                                  which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king
                                                                  of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went
                                                                  down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was
                                                                  sick.

14:022:007 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram:
                                                                  for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu
                                                                  the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the
                                                                  house of Ahab.

14:022:008 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment
                                                                  upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and
                                                                  the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to
                                                                  Ahaziah, he slew them.

14:022:009 And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in
                                                                  Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain
                                                                  him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of
                                                                  Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the
                                                                  house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.

14:022:010 But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
                                                                  dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house
                                                                  of Judah.

14:022:011 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son
                                                                  of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were
                                                                  slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So
                                                                  Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of
                                                                  Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid
                                                                  him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.

14:022:012 And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and
                                                                  Athaliah reigned over the land.

14:023:001 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and
                                                                  took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and
                                                                  Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and
                                                                  Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri,
                                                                  into covenant with him.

14:023:002 And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of
                                                                  all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of
                                                                  Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.

14:023:003 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
                                                                  house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son
                                                                  shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.

14:023:004 This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you
                                                                  entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites,
                                                                  shall be porters of the doors;

14:023:005 And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third
                                                                  part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall
                                                                  be in the courts of the house of the LORD.

14:023:006 But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the
                                                                  priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go
                                                                  in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch
                                                                  of the LORD.

14:023:007 And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man
                                                                  with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into
                                                                  the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king
                                                                  when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.

14:023:008 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
                                                                  Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men
                                                                  that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go
                                                                  out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the
                                                                  courses.

14:023:009 Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of
                                                                  hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king
                                                                  David's, which were in the house of God.

14:023:010 And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his
                                                                  hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of
                                                                  the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king
                                                                  round about.

14:023:011 Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the
                                                                  crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And
                                                                  Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the
                                                                  king.

14:023:012 Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
                                                                  praising the king, she came to the people into the house of
                                                                  the LORD:

14:023:013 And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at
                                                                  the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king:
                                                                  and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with
                                                                  trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and
                                                                  such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes,
                                                                  and said, Treason, Treason.

14:023:014 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds
                                                                  that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her
                                                                  forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain
                                                                  with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house
                                                                  of the LORD.

14:023:015 So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the
                                                                  entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her
                                                                  there.

14:023:016 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the
                                                                  people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's
                                                                  people.

14:023:017 Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it
                                                                  down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew
                                                                  Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.

14:023:018 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD
                                                                  by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had
                                                                  distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt
                                                                  offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses,
                                                                  with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.

14:023:019 And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD,
                                                                  that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.

14:023:020 And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
                                                                  governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and
                                                                  brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they
                                                                  came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the
                                                                  king upon the throne of the kingdom.

14:023:021 And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was
                                                                  quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

14:024:001 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he
                                                                  reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was
                                                                  Zibiah of Beersheba.

14:024:002 And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD
                                                                  all the days of Jehoiada the priest.

14:024:003 And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and
                                                                  daughters.

14:024:004 And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to
                                                                  repair the house of the LORD.

14:024:005 And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said
                                                                  to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all
                                                                  Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to
                                                                  year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites
                                                                  hastened it not.

14:024:006 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him,
                                                                  Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of
                                                                  Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the
                                                                  commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the
                                                                  congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?

14:024:007 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the
                                                                  house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house
                                                                  of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.

14:024:008 And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it
                                                                  without at the gate of the house of the LORD.

14:024:009 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to
                                                                  bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of
                                                                  God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.

14:024:010 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought
                                                                  in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.

14:024:011 Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought
                                                                  unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when
                                                                  they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the
                                                                  high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it,
                                                                  and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day,
                                                                  and gathered money in abundance.

14:024:012 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of
                                                                  the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and
                                                                  carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as
                                                                  wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.

14:024:013 So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them,
                                                                  and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened
                                                                  it.

14:024:014 And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the
                                                                  money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels
                                                                  for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to
                                                                  offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And
                                                                  they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD
                                                                  continually all the days of Jehoiada.

14:024:015 But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an
                                                                  hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.

14:024:016 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,
                                                                  because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and
                                                                  toward his house.

14:024:017 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and
                                                                  made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.

14:024:018 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and
                                                                  served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and
                                                                  Jerusalem for this their trespass.

14:024:019 Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the
                                                                  LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give
                                                                  ear.

14:024:020 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
                                                                  the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them,
                                                                  Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the
                                                                  LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the
                                                                  LORD, he hath also forsaken you.

14:024:021 And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at
                                                                  the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the
                                                                  LORD.

14:024:022 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada
                                                                  his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he
                                                                  died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.

14:024:023 And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of
                                                                  Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and
                                                                  Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from
                                                                  among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king
                                                                  of Damascus.

14:024:024 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,
                                                                  and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand,
                                                                  because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So
                                                                  they executed judgment against Joash.

14:024:025 And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in
                                                                  great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for
                                                                  the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on
                                                                  his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of
                                                                  David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.

14:024:026 And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son
                                                                  of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a
                                                                  Moabitess.

14:024:027 Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid
                                                                  upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they
                                                                  are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah
                                                                  his son reigned in his stead.

14:025:001 Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,
                                                                  and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his
                                                                  mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

14:025:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but
                                                                  not with a perfect heart.

14:025:003 Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,
                                                                  that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.

14:025:004 But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in
                                                                  the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded,
                                                                  saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither
                                                                  shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall
                                                                  die for his own sin.

14:025:005 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them
                                                                  captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according
                                                                  to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and
                                                                  Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and
                                                                  above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able
                                                                  to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.

14:025:006 He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
                                                                  Israel for an hundred talents of silver.

14:025:007 But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not
                                                                  the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with
                                                                  Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.

14:025:008 But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God
                                                                  shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to
                                                                  help, and to cast down.

14:025:009 And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for
                                                                  the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?
                                                                  And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee
                                                                  much more than this.

14:025:010 Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to
                                                                  him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger
                                                                  was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in
                                                                  great anger.

14:025:011 And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people,
                                                                  and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of
                                                                  Seir ten thousand.

14:025:012 And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah
                                                                  carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock,
                                                                  and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all
                                                                  were broken in pieces.

14:025:013 But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that
                                                                  they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of
                                                                  Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three
                                                                  thousand of them, and took much spoil.

14:025:014 Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the
                                                                  slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the
                                                                  children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed
                                                                  down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.

14:025:015 Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah,
                                                                  and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast
                                                                  thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not
                                                                  deliver their own people out of thine hand?

14:025:016 And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said
                                                                  unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why
                                                                  shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said,
                                                                  I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou
                                                                  hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.

14:025:017 Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the
                                                                  son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying,
                                                                  Come, let us see one another in the face.

14:025:018 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
                                                                  saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
                                                                  was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
                                                                  and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and
                                                                  trode down the thistle.

14:025:019 Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine
                                                                  heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why
                                                                  shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall,
                                                                  even thou, and Judah with thee?

14:025:020 But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might
                                                                  deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they
                                                                  sought after the gods of Edom.

14:025:021 So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another
                                                                  in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at
                                                                  Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

14:025:022 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled
                                                                  every man to his tent.

14:025:023 And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the
                                                                  son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought
                                                                  him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from
                                                                  the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

14:025:024 And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels
                                                                  that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the
                                                                  treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned
                                                                  to Samaria.

14:025:025 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
                                                                  death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

14:025:026 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold,
                                                                  are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and
                                                                  Israel?

14:025:027 Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following
                                                                  the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and
                                                                  he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and
                                                                  slew him there.

14:025:028 And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his
                                                                  fathers in the city of Judah.

14:026:001 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen
                                                                  years old, and made him king in the room of his father
                                                                  Amaziah.

14:026:002 He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
                                                                  slept with his fathers.

14:026:003 Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he
                                                                  reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name
                                                                  also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.

14:026:004 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
                                                                  according to all that his father Amaziah did.

14:026:005 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had
                                                                  understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought
                                                                  the LORD, God made him to prosper.

14:026:006 And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and
                                                                  brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the
                                                                  wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the
                                                                  Philistines.

14:026:007 And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the
                                                                  Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.

14:026:008 And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread
                                                                  abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened
                                                                  himself exceedingly.

14:026:009 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate,
                                                                  and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and
                                                                  fortified them.

14:026:010 Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for
                                                                  he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the
                                                                  plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains,
                                                                  and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.

14:026:011 Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to
                                                                  war by bands, according to the number of their account by the
                                                                  hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the
                                                                  hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.

14:026:012 The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men
                                                                  of valour were two thousand and six hundred.

14:026:013 And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and
                                                                  seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty
                                                                  power, to help the king against the enemy.

14:026:014 And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields,
                                                                  and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings
                                                                  to cast stones.

14:026:015 And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to
                                                                  be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and
                                                                  great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he
                                                                  was marvellously helped, till he was strong.

14:026:016 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his
                                                                  destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and
                                                                  went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the
                                                                  altar of incense.

14:026:017 And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him
                                                                  fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:

14:026:018 And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It
                                                                  appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the
                                                                  LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are
                                                                  consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou
                                                                  hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the
                                                                  LORD God.

14:026:019 Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn
                                                                  incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy
                                                                  even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house
                                                                  of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.

14:026:020 And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon
                                                                  him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they
                                                                  thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go
                                                                  out, because the LORD had smitten him.

14:026:021 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and
                                                                  dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off
                                                                  from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the
                                                                  king's house, judging the people of the land.

14:026:022 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah
                                                                  the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.

14:026:023 So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his
                                                                  fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the
                                                                  kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son
                                                                  reigned in his stead.

14:027:001 Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,
                                                                  and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name
                                                                  also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.

14:027:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
                                                                  according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he
                                                                  entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did
                                                                  yet corruptly.

14:027:003 He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the
                                                                  wall of Ophel he built much.

14:027:004 Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the
                                                                  forests he built castles and towers.

14:027:005 He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed
                                                                  against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year
                                                                  an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of
                                                                  wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of
                                                                  Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.

14:027:006 So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before
                                                                  the LORD his God.

14:027:007 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his
                                                                  ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel
                                                                  and Judah.

14:027:008 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
                                                                  reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

14:027:009 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
                                                                  city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

14:028:001 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
                                                                  reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which
                                                                  was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:

14:028:002 For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made
                                                                  also molten images for Baalim.

14:028:003 Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
                                                                  and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of
                                                                  the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of
                                                                  Israel.

14:028:004 He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and
                                                                  on the hills, and under every green tree.

14:028:005 Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the
                                                                  king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great
                                                                  multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And
                                                                  he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who
                                                                  smote him with a great slaughter.

14:028:006 For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and
                                                                  twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men;
                                                                  because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.

14:028:007 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's
                                                                  son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that
                                                                  was next to the king.

14:028:008 And the children of Israel carried away captive of their
                                                                  brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and
                                                                  took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to
                                                                  Samaria.

14:028:009 But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and
                                                                  he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said
                                                                  unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was
                                                                  wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and
                                                                  ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.

14:028:010 And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and
                                                                  Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there
                                                                  not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?

14:028:011 Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which
                                                                  ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath
                                                                  of the LORD is upon you.

14:028:012 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah
                                                                  the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and
                                                                  Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai,
                                                                  stood up against them that came from the war,

14:028:013 And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither:
                                                                  for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye
                                                                  intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our
                                                                  trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.

14:028:014 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the
                                                                  princes and all the congregation.

14:028:015 And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the
                                                                  captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among
                                                                  them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat
                                                                  and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of
                                                                  them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm
                                                                  trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.

14:028:016 At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to
                                                                  help him.

14:028:017 For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried
                                                                  away captives.

14:028:018 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low
                                                                  country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh,
                                                                  and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages
                                                                  thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and
                                                                  the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.

14:028:019 For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel;
                                                                  for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the
                                                                  LORD.

14:028:020 And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and
                                                                  distressed him, but strengthened him not.

14:028:021 For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and
                                                                  out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it
                                                                  unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.

14:028:022 And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more
                                                                  against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.

14:028:023 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him:
                                                                  and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them,
                                                                  therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But
                                                                  they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.

14:028:024 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God,
                                                                  and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up
                                                                  the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in
                                                                  every corner of Jerusalem.

14:028:025 And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn
                                                                  incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of
                                                                  his fathers.

14:028:026 Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last,
                                                                  behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and
                                                                  Israel.

14:028:027 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
                                                                  city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the
                                                                  sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son
                                                                  reigned in his stead.

14:029:001 Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old,
                                                                  and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his
                                                                  mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.

14:029:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
                                                                  according to all that David his father had done.

14:029:003 He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened
                                                                  the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.

14:029:004 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered
                                                                  them together into the east street,

14:029:005 And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now
                                                                  yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your
                                                                  fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.

14:029:006 For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil
                                                                  in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and
                                                                  have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD,
                                                                  and turned their backs.

14:029:007 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the
                                                                  lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings
                                                                  in the holy place unto the God of Israel.

14:029:008 Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem,
                                                                  and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to
                                                                  hissing, as ye see with your eyes.

14:029:009 For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons
                                                                  and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.

14:029:010 Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God
                                                                  of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.

14:029:011 My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to
                                                                  stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister
                                                                  unto him, and burn incense.

14:029:012 Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the
                                                                  son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons
                                                                  of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of
                                                                  Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and
                                                                  Eden the son of Joah:

14:029:013 And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the
                                                                  sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:

14:029:014 And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons
                                                                  of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.

14:029:015 And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves,
                                                                  and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the
                                                                  words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.

14:029:016 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the
                                                                  LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that
                                                                  they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the
                                                                  house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out
                                                                  abroad into the brook Kidron.

14:029:017 Now they began on the first day of the first month to
                                                                  sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the
                                                                  porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in
                                                                  eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they
                                                                  made an end.

14:029:018 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have
                                                                  cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt
                                                                  offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread
                                                                  table, with all the vessels thereof.

14:029:019 Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did
                                                                  cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and
                                                                  sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the
                                                                  LORD.

14:029:020 Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of
                                                                  the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.

14:029:021 And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven
                                                                  lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom,
                                                                  and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the
                                                                  priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the
                                                                  LORD.

14:029:022 So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the
                                                                  blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had
                                                                  killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they
                                                                  killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the
                                                                  altar.

14:029:023 And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering
                                                                  before the king and the congregation; and they laid their
                                                                  hands upon them:

14:029:024 And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with
                                                                  their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all
                                                                  Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the
                                                                  sin offering should be made for all Israel.

14:029:025 And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals,
                                                                  with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment
                                                                  of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet:
                                                                  for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.

14:029:026 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the
                                                                  priests with the trumpets.

14:029:027 And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
                                                                  altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD
                                                                  began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments
                                                                  ordained by David king of Israel.

14:029:028 And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and
                                                                  the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt
                                                                  offering was finished.

14:029:029 And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all
                                                                  that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.

14:029:030 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the
                                                                  Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David,
                                                                  and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness,
                                                                  and they bowed their heads and worshipped.

14:029:031 Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated
                                                                  yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and
                                                                  thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the
                                                                  congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as
                                                                  many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.

14:029:032 And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation
                                                                  brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and
                                                                  two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the
                                                                  LORD.

14:029:033 And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three
                                                                  thousand sheep.

14:029:034 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all
                                                                  the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did
                                                                  help them, till the work was ended, and until the other
                                                                  priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more
                                                                  upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.

14:029:035 And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat
                                                                  of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every
                                                                  burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was
                                                                  set in order.

14:029:036 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had
                                                                  prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.

14:030:001 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters
                                                                  also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the
                                                                  house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the
                                                                  LORD God of Israel.

14:030:002 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
                                                                  congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second
                                                                  month.

14:030:003 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests
                                                                  had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the
                                                                  people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.

14:030:004 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.

14:030:005 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout
                                                                  all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come
                                                                  to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem:
                                                                  for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was
                                                                  written.

14:030:006 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his
                                                                  princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the
                                                                  commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn
                                                                  again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he
                                                                  will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the
                                                                  hand of the kings of Assyria.

14:030:007 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
                                                                  trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who
                                                                  therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.

14:030:008 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield
                                                                  yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which
                                                                  he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that
                                                                  the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.

14:030:009 For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your
                                                                  children shall find compassion before them that lead them
                                                                  captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the
                                                                  LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away
                                                                  his face from you, if ye return unto him.

14:030:010 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
                                                                  Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them
                                                                  to scorn, and mocked them.

14:030:011 Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun
                                                                  humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.

14:030:012 Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do
                                                                  the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of
                                                                  the LORD.

14:030:013 And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast
                                                                  of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great
                                                                  congregation.

14:030:014 And they arose and took away the altars that were in
                                                                  Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and
                                                                  cast them into the brook Kidron.

14:030:015 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
                                                                  second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed,
                                                                  and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings
                                                                  into the house of the LORD.

14:030:016 And they stood in their place after their manner, according to
                                                                  the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the
                                                                  blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.

14:030:017 For there were many in the congregation that were not
                                                                  sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the
                                                                  killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to
                                                                  sanctify them unto the LORD.

14:030:018 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and
                                                                  Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves,
                                                                  yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written.
                                                                  But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon
                                                                  every one

14:030:019 That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his
                                                                  fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the
                                                                  purification of the sanctuary.

14:030:020 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.

14:030:021 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept
                                                                  the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness:
                                                                  and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day,
                                                                  singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.

14:030:022 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that
                                                                  taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat
                                                                  throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and
                                                                  making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.

14:030:023 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days:
                                                                  and they kept other seven days with gladness.

14:030:024 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a
                                                                  thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes
                                                                  gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand
                                                                  sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.

14:030:025 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the
                                                                  Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and
                                                                  the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that
                                                                  dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.

14:030:026 So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of
                                                                  Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like
                                                                  in Jerusalem.

14:030:027 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and
                                                                  their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy
                                                                  dwelling place, even unto heaven.

14:031:001 Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present
                                                                  went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in
                                                                  pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high
                                                                  places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in
                                                                  Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed
                                                                  them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man
                                                                  to his possession, into their own cities.

14:031:002 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the
                                                                  Levites after their courses, every man according to his
                                                                  service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for
                                                                  peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to
                                                                  praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.

14:031:003 He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the
                                                                  burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt
                                                                  offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for
                                                                  the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the
                                                                  law of the LORD.

14:031:004 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to
                                                                  give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they
                                                                  might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.

14:031:005 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of
                                                                  Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and
                                                                  oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the
                                                                  tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.

14:031:006 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in
                                                                  the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen
                                                                  and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated
                                                                  unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.

14:031:007 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the
                                                                  heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.

14:031:008 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
                                                                  blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.

14:031:009 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites
                                                                  concerning the heaps.

14:031:010 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered
                                                                  him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings
                                                                  into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and
                                                                  have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and
                                                                  that which is left is this great store.

14:031:011 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of
                                                                  the LORD; and they prepared them,

14:031:012 And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated
                                                                  things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler,
                                                                  and Shimei his brother was the next.

14:031:013 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,
                                                                  and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and
                                                                  Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei
                                                                  his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and
                                                                  Azariah the ruler of the house of God.

14:031:014 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the
                                                                  east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute
                                                                  the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.

14:031:015 And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and
                                                                  Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the
                                                                  priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by
                                                                  courses, as well to the great as to the small:

14:031:016 Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and
                                                                  upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of
                                                                  the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges
                                                                  according to their courses;

14:031:017 Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their
                                                                  fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in
                                                                  their charges by their courses;

14:031:018 And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives,
                                                                  and their sons, and their daughters, through all the
                                                                  congregation: for in their set office they sanctified
                                                                  themselves in holiness:

14:031:019 Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the
                                                                  fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city,
                                                                  the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all
                                                                  the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by
                                                                  genealogies among the Levites.

14:031:020 And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that
                                                                  which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.

14:031:021 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of
                                                                  God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God,
                                                                  he did it with all his heart, and prospered.

14:032:001 After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib
                                                                  king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped
                                                                  against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for
                                                                  himself.

14:032:002 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he
                                                                  was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,

14:032:003 He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop
                                                                  the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and
                                                                  they did help him.

14:032:004 So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all
                                                                  the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the
                                                                  land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find
                                                                  much water?

14:032:005 Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that
                                                                  was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall
                                                                  without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made
                                                                  darts and shields in abundance.

14:032:006 And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
                                                                  together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and
                                                                  spake comfortably to them, saying,

14:032:007 Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the
                                                                  king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him:
                                                                  for there be more with us than with him:

14:032:008 With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God
                                                                  to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested
                                                                  themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

14:032:009 After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants
                                                                  to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and
                                                                  all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto
                                                                  all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,

14:032:010 Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust,
                                                                  that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?

14:032:011 Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die
                                                                  by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall
                                                                  deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

14:032:012 Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his
                                                                  altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall
                                                                  worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?

14:032:013 Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the
                                                                  people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those
                                                                  lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?

14:032:014 Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my
                                                                  fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out
                                                                  of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out
                                                                  of mine hand?

14:032:015 Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you
                                                                  on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any
                                                                  nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine
                                                                  hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall
                                                                  your God deliver you out of mine hand?

14:032:016 And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and
                                                                  against his servant Hezekiah.

14:032:017 He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and
                                                                  to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of
                                                                  other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand,
                                                                  so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of
                                                                  mine hand.

14:032:018 Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the
                                                                  people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them,
                                                                  and to trouble them; that they might take the city.

14:032:019 And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the
                                                                  gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the
                                                                  hands of man.

14:032:020 And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah
                                                                  the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.

14:032:021 And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men
                                                                  of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the
                                                                  king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own
                                                                  land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they
                                                                  that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the
                                                                  sword.

14:032:022 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
                                                                  from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the
                                                                  hand of all other, and guided them on every side.

14:032:023 And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and
                                                                  presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified
                                                                  in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.

14:032:024 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto
                                                                  the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.

14:032:025 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done
                                                                  unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was
                                                                  wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.

14:032:026 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
                                                                  heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the
                                                                  wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.

14:032:027 And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made
                                                                  himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious
                                                                  stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of
                                                                  pleasant jewels;

14:032:028 Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil;
                                                                  and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.

14:032:029 Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and
                                                                  herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.

14:032:030 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of
                                                                  Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the
                                                                  city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.

14:032:031 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
                                                                  Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was
                                                                  done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know
                                                                  all that was in his heart.

14:032:032 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness,
                                                                  behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet,
                                                                  the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and
                                                                  Israel.

14:032:033 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in
                                                                  the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all
                                                                  Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his
                                                                  death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

14:033:001 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he
                                                                  reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:

14:033:002 But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like
                                                                  unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast
                                                                  out before the children of Israel.

14:033:003 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father
                                                                  had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made
                                                                  groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served
                                                                  them.

14:033:004 Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the
                                                                  LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.

14:033:005 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two
                                                                  courts of the house of the LORD.

14:033:006 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the
                                                                  valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used
                                                                  enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar
                                                                  spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of
                                                                  the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

14:033:007 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the
                                                                  house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon
                                                                  his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen
                                                                  before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:

14:033:008 Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of
                                                                  the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they
                                                                  will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according
                                                                  to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the
                                                                  hand of Moses.

14:033:009 So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to
                                                                  err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had
                                                                  destroyed before the children of Israel.

14:033:010 And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they
                                                                  would not hearken.

14:033:011 Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host
                                                                  of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns,
                                                                  and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.

14:033:012 And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God,
                                                                  and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,

14:033:013 And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard
                                                                  his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his
                                                                  kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.

14:033:014 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on
                                                                  the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in
                                                                  at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up
                                                                  a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced
                                                                  cities of Judah.

14:033:015 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the
                                                                  house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the
                                                                  mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast
                                                                  them out of the city.

14:033:016 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon
                                                                  peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to
                                                                  serve the LORD God of Israel.

14:033:017 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high
                                                                  places, yet unto the LORD their God only.

14:033:018 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his
                                                                  God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name
                                                                  of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the
                                                                  book of the kings of Israel.

14:033:019 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his
                                                                  sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high
                                                                  places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was
                                                                  humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the
                                                                  seers.

14:033:020 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his
                                                                  own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

14:033:021 Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
                                                                  reigned two years in Jerusalem.

14:033:022 But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
                                                                  did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the
                                                                  carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served
                                                                  them;

14:033:023 And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his
                                                                  father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.

14:033:024 And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his
                                                                  own house.

14:033:025 But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
                                                                  against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his
                                                                  son king in his stead.

14:034:001 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
                                                                  reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.

14:034:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
                                                                  walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither
                                                                  to the right hand, nor to the left.

14:034:003 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young,
                                                                  he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the
                                                                  twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the
                                                                  high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the
                                                                  molten images.

14:034:004 And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and
                                                                  the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the
                                                                  groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake
                                                                  in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the
                                                                  graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.

14:034:005 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and
                                                                  cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.

14:034:006 And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and
                                                                  Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.

14:034:007 And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had
                                                                  beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the
                                                                  idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to
                                                                  Jerusalem.

14:034:008 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged
                                                                  the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah,
                                                                  and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of
                                                                  Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.

14:034:009 And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered
                                                                  the money that was brought into the house of God, which the
                                                                  Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of
                                                                  Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of
                                                                  all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.

14:034:010 And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the
                                                                  oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the
                                                                  workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and
                                                                  amend the house:

14:034:011 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn
                                                                  stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which
                                                                  the kings of Judah had destroyed.

14:034:012 And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them
                                                                  were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari;
                                                                  and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to
                                                                  set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill
                                                                  of instruments of musick.

14:034:013 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers
                                                                  of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of
                                                                  the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.

14:034:014 And when they brought out the money that was brought into the
                                                                  house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law
                                                                  of the LORD given by Moses.

14:034:015 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have
                                                                  found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And
                                                                  Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.

14:034:016 And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king
                                                                  word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy
                                                                  servants, they do it.

14:034:017 And they have gathered together the money that was found in
                                                                  the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of
                                                                  the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.

14:034:018 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the
                                                                  priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the
                                                                  king.

14:034:019 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
                                                                  law, that he rent his clothes.

14:034:020 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
                                                                  and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah
                                                                  a servant of the king's, saying,

14:034:021 Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in
                                                                  Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is
                                                                  found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out
                                                                  upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the
                                                                  LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.

14:034:022 And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to
                                                                  Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath,
                                                                  the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in
                                                                  Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that
                                                                  effect.

14:034:023 And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell
                                                                  ye the man that sent you to me,

14:034:024 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
                                                                  place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses
                                                                  that are written in the book which they have read before the
                                                                  king of Judah:

14:034:025 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
                                                                  other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the
                                                                  works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out
                                                                  upon this place, and shall not be quenched.

14:034:026 And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the
                                                                  LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of
                                                                  Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;

14:034:027 Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself
                                                                  before God, when thou heardest his words against this place,
                                                                  and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself
                                                                  before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I
                                                                  have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.

14:034:028 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be
                                                                  gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see
                                                                  all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the
                                                                  inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.

14:034:029 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of
                                                                  Judah and Jerusalem.

14:034:030 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the
                                                                  men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the
                                                                  priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small:
                                                                  and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the
                                                                  covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.

14:034:031 And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before
                                                                  the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his
                                                                  commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all
                                                                  his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the
                                                                  covenant which are written in this book.

14:034:032 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin
                                                                  to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according
                                                                  to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.

14:034:033 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the
                                                                  countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made
                                                                  all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the
                                                                  LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from
                                                                  following the LORD, the God of their fathers.

14:035:001 Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem:
                                                                  and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
                                                                  first month.

14:035:002 And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them
                                                                  to the service of the house of the LORD,

14:035:003 And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were
                                                                  holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which
                                                                  Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall
                                                                  not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your
                                                                  God, and his people Israel,

14:035:004 And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after
                                                                  your courses, according to the writing of David king of
                                                                  Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.

14:035:005 And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the
                                                                  families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after
                                                                  the division of the families of the Levites.

14:035:006 So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare
                                                                  your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the
                                                                  LORD by the hand of Moses.

14:035:007 And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids,
                                                                  all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to
                                                                  the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks:
                                                                  these were of the king's substance.

14:035:008 And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the
                                                                  priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel,
                                                                  rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the
                                                                  passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle
                                                                  and three hundred oxen.

14:035:009 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and
                                                                  Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave
                                                                  unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small
                                                                  cattle, and five hundred oxen.

14:035:010 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their
                                                                  place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the
                                                                  king's commandment.

14:035:011 And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the
                                                                  blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.

14:035:012 And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give
                                                                  according to the divisions of the families of the people, to
                                                                  offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses.
                                                                  And so did they with the oxen.

14:035:013 And they roasted the passover with fire according to the
                                                                  ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and
                                                                  in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all
                                                                  the people.

14:035:014 And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the
                                                                  priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in
                                                                  offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore
                                                                  the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the
                                                                  sons of Aaron.

14:035:015 And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place,
                                                                  according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman,
                                                                  and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every
                                                                  gate; they might not depart from their service; for their
                                                                  brethren the Levites prepared for them.

14:035:016 So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to
                                                                  keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar
                                                                  of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.

14:035:017 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover
                                                                  at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.

14:035:018 And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the
                                                                  days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of
                                                                  Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests,
                                                                  and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present,
                                                                  and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

14:035:019 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this
                                                                  passover kept.

14:035:020 After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho
                                                                  king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by
                                                                  Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.

14:035:021 But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with
                                                                  thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day,
                                                                  but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded
                                                                  me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is
                                                                  with me, that he destroy thee not.

14:035:022 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but
                                                                  disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened
                                                                  not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to
                                                                  fight in the valley of Megiddo.

14:035:023 And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his
                                                                  servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.

14:035:024 His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put
                                                                  him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to
                                                                  Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the
                                                                  sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned
                                                                  for Josiah.

14:035:025 And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and
                                                                  the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to
                                                                  this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold,
                                                                  they are written in the lamentations.

14:035:026 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness,
                                                                  according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,

14:035:027 And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the
                                                                  book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

14:036:001 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah,
                                                                  and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.

14:036:002 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to
                                                                  reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.

14:036:003 And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned
                                                                  the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.

14:036:004 And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah
                                                                  and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho
                                                                  took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.

14:036:005 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to
                                                                  reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did
                                                                  that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.

14:036:006 Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound
                                                                  him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.

14:036:007 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the
                                                                  LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.

14:036:008 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations
                                                                  which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they
                                                                  are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and
                                                                  Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.

14:036:009 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
                                                                  reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did
                                                                  that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.

14:036:010 And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and
                                                                  brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house
                                                                  of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and
                                                                  Jerusalem.

14:036:011 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,
                                                                  and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.

14:036:012 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his
                                                                  God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet
                                                                  speaking from the mouth of the LORD.

14:036:013 And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made
                                                                  him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his
                                                                  heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.

14:036:014 Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people,
                                                                  transgressed very much after all the abominations of the
                                                                  heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had
                                                                  hallowed in Jerusalem.

14:036:015 And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his
                                                                  messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had
                                                                  compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:

14:036:016 But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words,
                                                                  and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose
                                                                  against his people, till there was no remedy.

14:036:017 Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who
                                                                  slew their young men with the sword in the house of their
                                                                  sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old
                                                                  man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his
                                                                  hand.

14:036:018 And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and
                                                                  the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of
                                                                  the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.

14:036:019 And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of
                                                                  Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and
                                                                  destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.

14:036:020 And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to
                                                                  Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until
                                                                  the reign of the kingdom of Persia:

14:036:021 To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until
                                                                  the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay
                                                                  desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.

14:036:022 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
                                                                  of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be
                                                                  accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of
                                                                  Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his
                                                                  kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,

14:036:023 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth
                                                                  hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me
                                                                  to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is
                                                                  there among you of all his people? The LORD his God be with
                                                                  him, and let him go up.
